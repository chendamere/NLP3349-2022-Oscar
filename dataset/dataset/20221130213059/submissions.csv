movies,2d9wie,1407793753,The Inbetweeners 2: Official Discussion [SPOILERS],"With The Inbetweeners 2 out in the UK, I reckon it's about time to start discussing the movie. Compared to the first, I thought this was a lot funnier, and a lot more disgusting, but the first was the better movie. I'll go into more detail with the positives and negatives:\n\n\n**Positives**\n\n\n- There were some genuinely side-splitting scenes, such as the poo-down-slide scene and its aftermath, and Neil's mirage, which had the whole audience in tears. \n\n- All four protagonists had a part to play and so Will and Simon didn't steal all the limelight, with Jay's character development especially well portrayed.\n\n- The transition from first to second film was relatively smooth and most loose-ends were tied up.\n\n\n**Negatives**\n\n\n- There *were* some dud jokes, which there were bound to be when the ""banter"" was coming thick and fast. Most scenes with the dreadlocks guy were fairly cringeworthy, which leads onto my next point...\n\n- The side characters were fairly stereotypical, where you've seen them all before. While I know fleshing out characters isn't the comedy's main priority, it still felt like a let-down from the first movie.\n\n- The film didn't really lead anywhere. Will didn't get the girl; the subplot was abruptly ended with Will storming off. I thought that the characters would return at some point but strangely the subplot didn't lead anywhere. Furthermore, Jay didn't get the girl, rendering the whole trip useless just so that the film could use a one-liner that has been heard so many times before in comedies. The characters went to Australia, and got back to Australia, with absolutely no change.\n\n- The choice of doing the desert scene was strange. It killed off all the momentum and, while it did include some funny scenes (I found the drinking urine scene hilarious), it failed when aspiring to be sentimental.\n\n- Heavy misogyny. I know this is an Inbetweeners movie but the first movie did so well in fleshing out strong female characters that I felt let down by the only female character being an annoying dud.\n\n\nOverall the film is worth a watch, and exactly what you'd expect, but as a film it failed to deliver a plot or side characters as substantial as the first movie. 3/5",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2d9wie/the_inbetweeners_2_official_discussion_spoilers/,6
