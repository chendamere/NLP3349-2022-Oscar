gdtwjsz,"I really enjoyed the movie, the first part of the movie felt like typical romcom, predictable but very comforting. And the second part, especially when the sisters argued, it felt really heavy and cathartic in a positive way.

The redemption part felt little bit rushed for me and I kinda wished Riley (Aubrey Plaza) arc got resolved. That being said I really like the chemistry of between her and Kristen Stewart, it was really charming. Also, I think Mackenzie Davies and Kristen Stewart chemistry was pretty good, especially in the beginning of the movie.

In the end, pretty refreshing romcom and I think Kristen Stewart should be in more romance and comedy movies.

gdtyci9,"I really enjoyed this movie. Great cast (including smaller cameo parts), and a lot of very funny moments mixed into a cute feel good story. Wanted to get that out of the way so that my minor complaints don’t come off as too negative. However...

I *hated* that Harper repeatedly left Abby alone at parties where she didn’t know anyone, or sent on outings with family members she’d just met, or ditched her to stay out late at a bar with her old friends. It made me so uncomfortable. Separately and independently from everything about her family issues and closetedness, she was just an inattentive partner and bad friend to Abby, who she’d brought into this very awkward and uncomfortable situation in the first place. I feel like they spent too much screen time showing her being a bad partner to strain their relationship and not enough showing why they were good together in a relationship to begin with. 

Also, Jane was very clearly the best member of that family from the start. The most heartbreaking moment wasn’t about any of the romantic or family relationships, it was when Jane’s absolutely beautiful painting got destroyed. And the most gratifying (albeit heavily telegraphed) moment was after the time jump when her novel was a bestseller.",k2ctta
gdtvzu5,Dan Levy’s scene about coming out to your family was such an emotional scene. He stole any scene he was in.,k2ctta
gdz1q8g,"I just read [this article](https://www.indiewire.com/2020/11/happiest-season-clea-duvall-queer-rom-com-1234599465/)

> Late in the film, Harper’s sexuality is unmasked — without her consent — to her entire family, the kind of big revelation scene that has populated many a rom-com, but “Happiest Season” gives it a painful twist. Harper doesn’t use the moment to finally come out, but to pull herself deeper into the closet. It’s heartbreaking for Abby, and the kind of disruption to genre expectations that makes the film so special.
> 
> “We all have our baggage, we all have our main triggers and our fight or flight responses, and I think Harper is someone who was like operating in this certain way for a long time,” DuVall said. “It’s this devastating moment where your instincts kick in and you realize that you have not come as far as you thought you have, because you haven’t really confronted yourself. It’s a very humbling moment and something that I think we can all relate to, no matter what it is we’re overcoming. You don’t overcome it on the first try.”

Yeah, this made me understand that reveal your queerness is not as easy as you think, especially when you can't predict their reaction

> As Abby flees from the scene, it’s John who catches up with her. Instead of tossing off some sassy witticisms, Levy’s character instead offers an emotional and introspective assessment of the situation, one that leans heavily on some necessary empathy.
> 
> “I wrote this speech about coming out, because I was thinking about how we can have compassion for Harper in that moment,” DuVall said. “She does do something that is pretty bad and I can see why an audience would be upset with her, but it’s also about wanting to have compassion for people who are going through that. Coming out is so different for everybody. For some people, it’s super easy and I think that’s great for them, but for a lot of people, it’s really not.”

Yeah, glad that she gave Dan Levy (John) one of the most gut-punching moment in the movie, he really delivered on that.",k2ctta

gf3peqv,"Yo... the closet is rough, I get that. But the closet doesn't make you ignore your girlfriend, spend all night with an ex, and then call her ""smothering"" when she calls you on it. The hell was this movie

Like, it sets up the premise like it's gonna be a lot of wacky misunderstandings, but all the conflicts and misunderstandings are not even remotely played like they're supposed to be funny. Weirdly dark movie, just weird all around.",k2ctta
gdyyxp7,"The movie suffered from making Harper too evil and the parents too nice. We're constantly told how horrible the dad is and I just didn't see it. He's not depicted as a good person, but if you want to justify Harper's awfulness, you needed to make the parents worse.  Also you can't have Harper be the favorite child, I feel like Harper's behavior would have been slightly more justifiable if the parents kept fawning over Allison Brie and ignoring Harper. 

I'm not the first person to say this, but this needed to be a braver movie where Harper and Abby just break up. A lot of Harper being a bad partner had little to do with her parents. Leaving Abby at all the parties, being jealous and hypocritical, etc.  

If you have to end this movie with Harper and Abby together, cut out some moments of Harper being cruel to Abby, change the whole beginning to flesh out Harper and Abby and show why they are together, and have Allison Brie be the favorite child and not Harper.",k2ctta
gdtoayf,I really want to see the movie Kristen Stewart and Aubrey Plaza thought they were making,k2ctta
gg6w3dj,"I think the biggest problem is they didn't do enough to get people invested in Abby and Harper's relationship. All they get you to do is like Abby (you know, she doesn't like Christmas but is willing to put that aside, shes gonna propose) but then you spend over an hour watching her get dumped on by a never ending parade of shitty, toxic assholes. So you could give a rat's ass about them fixing their relationship, you'd rather just see Abby get the hell out of there. Then they rushed into trying to tie a little bow into redeeming this crappy family before it felt earned.

I spent the entire back half of the movie hoping Kristen Stewart and Aubrey Plaza would run off together. Let them bond over what an asshole Harper is.

(But I liked Dan Levy)",k2ctta

gdy3i5d,"Overall I really enjoyed it but where they lost me was at the very end. There was so much toxic build up, Abby was hurt so much. If they wanted Abby and Harper to stay together, they should have at least did a small time jump...something like— Abby does leave and goes home. Stays with a friend and she runs back into Harper on NYE..

We see Harper working things out with her parents before then and really digesting her behavior and how she fucked up. Then they agree to try again and we see them all happy and together again next Christmas. 

I did still feel for Harper, coming out can be so incredibly scary and painful as Levy’s character so aptly pointed out. But Harper needed some time to work on it instead of them just going “Oh cool, poof it’s all better now”.",k2ctta
gdzvl9s,"Thoughtful/constructive commentary aside, I just really liked the height difference between Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis. Either Kristen is tinier than I've realised, or Mackenzie is basically an Amazon.",k2ctta
ggvbj0r,"I wonder if anyone (while filming) brought up the fact that they made Harper almost too unlikable in this.

ggk2t3y,"This movie had the chance to be great and it blew it. It needed to make the bold move and it settled for the sappy ending instead.

Abbey deserved so much better and Harper was legit awful. I know it’s about her struggle feeling like she has to choose between her family or her girlfriend, but that’s just like... I don’t know.

Abbey should’ve ended up going home with John and starting over completely or she should have gotten with Riley.",k2ctta
gdtzzuw,"Harpers parents were straight up shitty people with no redeeming qualities and them suddenly being ok with everything at the end was absurd and also makes Harpers feeling extremely stupid, Harper was a selfish asshole too, she constantly treated Abby like shit and was completely oblivious to how her parents were treating her. Doesn’t matter if she’s terrified of her parents disowning her. Fuck them anyway they were extremely toxic and writhe with mental abuse.",k2ctta
gdu1e4v,"There's something about Christmas movies having the worst families, they were all terrible to each other.

gf3wvys,"Can we get a sequel around the best characters, John (Dan Levy) Riley (Aubrey Plaza) and Jane (Mary Holland), the latter of whom deserved SO MUCH better? They can all wingman/wingwoman each other. 

Like it can be around Harper and Abby hosting Christmas or having a Christmas wedding, whatever.",k2ctta
gfk3wfm,"I liked it. And I feel like a lot of folks in this comment section are falling prey to that most Reddit of behaviours, looking at one bad time and suggesting someone throw their entire relationship out.

The opening picture montage tells us that Abby and Harper have been together, and happy, for over a year; Abby moved in six months ago, and things have gone so well she's planning to propose. Aside from a bit of awkwardness on their date, every indication is that this is a happy, functional couple. 

And then they visit Harper's family. After just a couple of days of being closeted and surrounded by toxic people Abby wants to get out of there, and who can blame her? These people suck! She's not at all wrong to leave that party, or to tell Harper it's over at that point. But Abby's feeling punchy and angry and off-balance after just a few days of hiding herself around strangers; why are we surprised that Harper is an even worse mess when she's doing it with her family? Of course she's acting shitty, look at the environment she was raised in! When she's in the city with Abby and John she can be her actual self, but in her parents house she reverts to being the paranoid closeted lying teenage trainwreck she was.

And if she'd stayed that way, Abby would've been entirely right to walk away and never look back. But, and this is the important part, Harper doesn't stay that way; she recognizes that she's been shitty to Abby, she admits her mistakes and apologizes and promises to do better. And as we see literally the next day, when she's openly cuddling with Abby on the couch, and when Abby is invited into the family picture, there is change and their is improvement. And if someone is working to change, is it really so wrong to give them another chance?

I liked Happiest Season because it does what romcoms so rarely do; show a couple actually working through a problem and coming out the other side. 

Also, because Dan Levy. But who doesn't like Dan Levy?",k2ctta

yeah anyways i loved abby john and jane but harper? ew no gross!

sloane did not need to be redeemed shes an asshole who outed her own sister outta jealousy..

harper also did not need to be redeemed at all. shes terrible, toxic, manipulative, mean, a hypocrite and bitchy. like yeah being closeted is hard but thats no excuse?! for being a terrible gf??!

gdtjmfa,"have the major gripe with it as everyone else but all will be forgiven when Kristen Stewart and Aubrey Plaza make out in some indie in a couple years

onto the positives: like all the best rom-coms it’s a secret horror movie, Mary Steenburgen is hilarious, few actors are as good at Kristen Stewart at communicating emotional devastation without making a big show of it, Mary Holland rules, Dan Levy made me cry once again, and Aubrey Plaza/Kristen Stewart at the drag bar was one of my favorite scenes of the year.

Mackenzie Davis continues to be weirdly used in movies but when her character wasn’t being a rom-com monster she was quite good, and she had some terrific moments at the end. still seemed a little bit miscast though - for some reason Mary Elizabeth Winstead kept coming to mind as someone who might've been a better fit.",k2ctta

gdu8ppr,"This movie was just watching poor Abby be treated like absolute trash by the entire family. Harper was so mean and selfish the entire time, there was nothing redeeming about her character or chemistry in that relationship. But damn did Aubrey plaza and Kirsten Stewart have chemistry I knew it would have been a weird pivot but I still was hoping they would get together. They should just take out all the lame characters and make a movie with Riley Abby John, and Jane.",k2ctta

gg6k1is,"John's line towards, when he told Abby that Harper not coming out had nothing to do with her love for Abby. And then explaining how everyone's experience is different. Besides that moment and the parts with Jane, very few saving graces for this film tbh.",k2ctta
gdtlkey,It was okay. I know it was going for that situational family comedy but the whole family was really unlikable and not in a quirky way. I also didn't think Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis had the best chemistry but Harper was also hard to root for at times so that probably didn't help. I actually agree with everyone else praising Aubrey Plaza. I wouldn't have been upset if the film took a turn and the lead got with her instead. Even at the end I was hoping they'd show her character one more time for a resolution.,k2ctta
gdv1khm,"I think the early romcom framing is throwing people *way* off in how to process Harper's stuff later on. You're not meant to like her decisions - she doesn't even like them! - you're meant to understand they're way out of character compared to the usual flow of their relationship, that's the point. The movie could maybe have done a little more to show us their relationship before that stage to catch any stragglers, but I was surprised it seemed to be lost on so many commenters.


I still keep seeing people get hung up on the ""suffocating me"" bit though for example, but that was very obviously about her and her family rather than Abby? 

Idk, it just feels like a lot of people wailing on Harper haven't really given much thought before to what being in the closet actually costs or does to somebody. It does make them do lots of unsympathetic things, and they don't like themselves much for it either. Harper clearly isn't enjoying the person she's making herself here any more than Abby is. And the fact her family fucked Sloane up so much too makes me inclined to think she wasn't actually being that irrational in her fears about them.",k2ctta
gdx3vdo,"Critics went reaaally easy on this. So many lousy sitcom-y set pieces and Gags that make no sense or could be easily solved by basic communication. 

Also thought it let the family off way too easy in the end. Would've been better if the dad's financier decided to use the gay angle to virtue signal how ""progressive"" the dad was.

Also Kristen shouldn't have taken her back.

gel8eip,"I wouldn’t mind the movie ending with Abby and Harper breaking up but not for Abby to end up with Riley, a person she just met, right after almost proposing to someone else. I wouldn’t mind it to be revealed during the time jump montage, though.",k2ctta
ghafbwm,"I absolutely understand Dan’s speech to Abby about how coming out is such a personal experience and that it varies from being supported to getting kicked out and everything in between. I believe it’s so important to understand that many times someone’s inability to come out has nothing to do with their partner and everything to do with themselves. 

Harper wasn’t wrong for wanting to stay in the closet, it’s such a personal choice (she was absolutely wrong for outing Riley’s character though) but I also think Abby wasn’t wrong either. Her line “I want to be with someone that’s ready” is such a fucking important one. Often times were made to feel guilty for not wanting to date someone in the closet. And while you are not allowed to tell someone when and how they should come out, you most certainly are allowed to choose whom you love and “out” is an acceptable standard to have. I think that needs to be talked about more.

Harper coming out to her partners and telling Abby “no wait look see I did it I love you” and Abby responding with “I’m sorry it’s too late” was so...painful. But fair. I really wish Abby had left and Harper had had to deal with that. I think it would have made for a more impactful story if Harper was made to truly feel the effects of the pain she caused not only Abby, but Riley as well. Her “I’m so sorry” to Riley does not, in any way, make up for outing a teenager. Harpers character fell flat for me. 

I know it’s a movie and everything but I just feel they dropped the ball in the last 30 minutes. 

But I’m also a sucker for cheesy rom coms that take place during the holidays. And I’ve had a major crush on Kristen Stewart since she was in Twilight so I’ll take what I can get.",k2ctta

gf94s6m,"Wasted potential: the movie 

I like complex, flawed characters but after the first 5 minutes Harper has basically an hour+ of treating her girlfriend like shit. Where’s the balance? Why are we supposed to root for them? They overdid it with the ex bf, leaving her alone at parties, staying out at night, the fight and smashing her sweet sister’s painting. If they’d just gone with the “lies to her parents cause she’s scared, but they’re in it together” it would’ve been a way better movie. That, or change the ending. 

Also, it’s somewhere stuck between comedy and drama. It’s not funny enough and people act too shit for it to be a pleasant romcom, but there’s too many ridiculous moments for it to be an effective drama. 

On the plus side, great cast, chemistry and a couple of laugh-out-louds, mostly from Dan Levy.

It felt like a reverse The Family Stone. They didn’t flesh out enough of the characters, so most seemed flat. Toxic relationship that the abuser gets away with their shittiness. Dan Levy’s monologue was the high point of the film. That ending was unrealistic and rushed. Not good at all. I wanted to like this, so much so I didn’t even watch the trailer. I figured it would be good, so no point spoiling jokes. But I’m walking away with no desire to rewatch.",k2ctta

ge2vdjt,"Okay I went into this expecting it to be really bad and was very pleasantly surprised. It would actually be among my top holiday movies if it weren't for all the b.s. that it pulls in the last twenty minutes or so:

- Harper was forgiven *much* too easily after spending about 95 per cent of the movie being absolutely thoughtless and borderline cruel to the woman she supposedly loves, starting with putting her in that horrible situation in the first place. You can easily feel sorry for her (as a child of narcissistic parents, I know all too well the deeply-ingrained feeling that keeping them happy has to be your number-one focus at the cost of everything else) but it would have been better character development to have Abby leave her in the end (and get together with Riley, imo).

- Harper's sister was also forgiven too easily for forcing her out of the closet.

- After the brilliant conversation between Abby and John about the reality of coming out to your parents, having Harper's parents' homophobia magically cured to the point of them suddenly being written as different people felt *too* fairytale-y. Trying to redeem her mother who's been a monster the whole time by having her be like 'Oh I actually hate flowers and want to learn karate'? And the dad being like 'wow forget my lifelong ambition to become mayor, I've just realised my family is more important' felt right out of a bad 90s children's movie.

- Jane's realisation of 'I deserve better' came out of absolutley nowhere.

Ultimately I guess I wanted to see a relatable ending where the sisters bonded and realised they are valid and don't need the approval of their abusive parents, and waving a magic wand to have them turn into great parents on the spot instead was a bit disappointing.

Still cute though! 4/5.",k2ctta
gdzbg26,"The stress of coming out does not excuse abusing your girlfriend for 4 days and lying to her for a majority of your relationship. It does not excuse outing your first girlfriend and then allowing your friends to bully her and not even apologize to her for TEN years. Harper did not bravely come out to her parents in defense of her girlfriend. She was outed by her sister during a fight and didn’t even know where her girlfriend was. She was terrible to Abby. Like, really really terrible. Like, you can’t fix it with a simple “I’m sorry” terrible. I’m not saying Harper was evil, I am saying that there are natural consequences for poor choices. The ONLY acceptable ending to this movie would have been Abby leaving Harper and her toxic family. They even could have even jumped to a year later, showing that Harper had done some growing and came out to her parents on her own. The movie could have ended with her and Abby getting a drink to catch up or something. I would have been okay with that. You don’t get to treat people like shit and then make up for it by doing the bare fucking minimum. Jesus Christ. That mending deserved time at the very least. Queer kids are supposed to grow up watching this movie? What message are they supposed to get? That it’s okay to be hidden, abused, and lied to as long as you get a half hearted sorry after?The most frustrating part is that the majority of the movie is fine. The supporting characters are great, the jokes are funny, and it’s one amazing cast. The last ten minutes are what really kill me.

I think the biggest issue is that it doesn't know what it wants to be and tries to do too much.

Is it a happy feel good LGBT Hallmark movie? Is it a story about self-acceptance? Is it a story about overcoming relationship issues in the face of prejudice? Is it a slapstick comedy with caricature characters? Was it a comment on heteronormative relationship culture? Family drama? Political grandstanding? 

There is just so much going on and all of it comes off half-baked. From Stewart's character's needlessly tragic backstory to the family's eventual come together moments. It's off.",k2ctta

gdxatfz,"Just came here to say two things: 

1) The reason why the audience is confused about who Abby should end up with is because the audience spends as much screen time with Harper and Abby as it does Riley and Abby. Either we should have spent more time with Harper in the beginning to know she had redeeming qualities, or the movie should have just let Abby walk away from a toxic relationship.

2) The reason Harper was so toxic was directly pointed out in one of their final confrontations that her parents make her prove her worth to earn their love. The father is a full blown narcissist, and the characters go out of their way to avoid saying so, instead saying things like ""we have to earn your love"" or ""you care so much about reputation"".

The fact that the movie tried to redeem both Harper and the father in the last ten minutes of the movie really bothered me.",k2ctta

gedp7vm,"I have a lot of thoughts that have already been shared here but basically, there were two ways this could have gone - either A. Harper is a horrible girlfriend, Abby should leave her and get with Riley, or B. Harper is also a victim of the situation and Abby is right to forgive her - I feel like the movie didn't quite commit to either and that's why the ending doesn't feel satisfying.

Overall, I still liked ""Happiest Season"" and I loved being able to watch a lesbian Christmas movie with my girlfriend. I so appreciate that Hulu actually put in some real money and effort to the production and promotion of this movie. Clea Duvall did a great job.",k2ctta

The only redeeming part for me was John. At the start, he felt like a stereotypical gay friend but he stole every scene in the movie, especially when he supports Abby when she left the house.

gfi025h,"Harper was an asshole through the whole movie, and in no way made up for it. Also that throw away line she said about how she found Kristen ""John taught me about trackers"" NO lol

John is Kristens friend, not Harper's, and Kristen just found out about the tracker the day she left, meaning there's no way Harper talked with John about trackers let alone buying one and using one.  Stupid line, and if it were real then would've been further reason to break up with her cause that's an obsessive level of paranoia towards her gf. I know it's a joke for the audience, but it made no sense in the internal logic of the movie.

Last thing, the phone call at the end was contrived. The writers prioritized convenience over truth/reality. If he wanted the job he would've had to hide his gay daughters sexuality? Lmao is this movie set in the 70s or something? His character is conservative, but conservatives don't care if his daughter is gay (Dave Rubin is famous on the right and he is gay and married. despite common belief hardly anyone cares who you have sex with). In fact, in reality and not Hollywood illogical narrative, having a gay daughter would be a political lottery, it would gain this conservative candidate some liberal voters in addition to his conservative base.

In conclusion, it was ok, not a great movie. The beginning had Get Out vibes lol. The ""funny"" character was mostly a miss, but near the end had one or two good moments. Considering the errors, some that I already mentioned, i don't see this movie being rewatchable.",k2ctta

Especially when Stewart and Plaza are so awesome.

It wasn't perfect though.

gdu2ave,"I really enjoyed this film; loved the story, direction, and the cast. I am from a family with two other sisters, and the dynamic between the three sisters was hilariously accurate.

Another thing I noticed: There is a lot of criticism towards Harper's character (i.e., ditching Abby to hang out with her straight friends), which some sense, and the manner that she prioritized her family over Abby for a good part of the film. I want to share that coming out to family is so complicated—it is not a linear process. I am trying to see Harper's perspective with compassion and patience. I know some queer people who are incredibly close to their family, and they have put their queerness aside to maintain that connection and not lose their family. It's not my place to judge.",k2ctta
gfvbl4y,"I liked it because it really showed the complexity of the relationship, and the internalized shame vs the being forced back into the closet and how both women went through thier own journey.

 Both perspectives were valid, and raw, and honest. And complex with it's own unique baggage. I also like the happy ending, even though not every story ends that way in real life.

 It shows that you can go through messy, complicated conflicts, and not just throw away an entire relationship because of it.",k2ctta
gdw7z5r,"I've never seen Dan Levy in anything before and he was easily my favourite character. He's hilarious and his monologue was really moving.

Kristen Stewart is also really good in this film. Apart from Stewart and Levy, it's a cute but mediocre Christmas rom-com, but about a lesbian couple. It's nice that now there exists a mainstream lesbian rom-com, but it could've been better. The pacing is awkward, Davis and Stewart don't have much chemistry and Harper's family is too mean and their relationships are too toxic to make the sudden happy end believable.

7/10 (with a big sympathy bonus for Levy, Stewart and Aubrey Plaza)",k2ctta
gdz6ygd,"I really wanted to like this more than I did. It's a shame too, because the first 15 minutes or so are super cute and I was hopeful this would end up another holiday classic. That being said, I just think the tone of this ended up feeling off.

Yes, LGBTQ romance is definitely minimized in major film in comparison to hetero relationships, but did they have to go with the most basic plot ever by shoving one of the women into the closet? That story has been told 100 times. It's 2020, not 2002, surely there are other plots gay characters can have other than overcoming their fear of being outed. 

That being said, since they did pick this plot to pivot around, did they have to make Harper and her family the worst people on earth?? At first I was chuckling at how awkward everything seemed, but it just reaches a point where they're all so annoying and repugnant that I didn't want to see any of them redeemed (including Harper.)

There's something so annoyingly cloying and false to the resolution of this movie to me. Some relationships aren't worth saving. That can be a relationship with toxic parents or siblings too. I think in this case the happier ending would have been Abby ending up with Riley, and with Harper understanding that she needed time to learn to live her truth on her own.",k2ctta
gdw1u9g,"Mackenzie Davis’s character SUCKED. How fucking selfish can you be to ask your SO to come home for Christmas when you haven’t even come out to your parents? I get how frustrating and terrifying that can be and IS for many people, but this is 2020, not 2005. Having grown up conservative, I can say with a fair degree of certainty that unless your parents are the most hardline conservative people in the world, they’ll most likely accept the fact that you’re gay even if they’re not thrilled with it. I can even accept that dad behaving the way he did bc he was running for office: not an excuse, but I understand. For Davis to stand in the middle of the room and lie about being a lesbian after she just told Kay-Stew that she wanted to be with her is unforgivable. I would have broken up with her right there. Obviously for plot convenience they have to get back together but that is some straight up disrespectful, manipulative horseshit. Thank God for Dan Levy.",k2ctta

ge9pvpb,"Honestly, I’m so annoyed at hearing all of this “she should have dumped Harper for Riley!” stuff. I feel like this thread and the rest of Twitter are acting like random commenters on r/relationshipadvice. The moment something goes wrong, “leave them!!!!!!!!” 

For everyone bashing every move Harper made, I really hope you straight people are not judging someone on their fear of coming out. You don’t know what it’s like. I come from a very familiar conservative high pressure family that must always please their family and I was shaking to my core when i finally came out. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Would i have made the same bad decisions as Harper?  No, but i understand they were under immense pressure and stress during the holidays with their family and bringing home their loved one (even as just a friend) for the first time. Plus, doesn’t all of these lazy complaints kind of completely defeat the entire purpose of Dan Levy’s amazing speech they gave??? 

Lastly, everyone assuming that Abbie and Riley should have been together really do not understand queer relationships and it’s borderline insulting that any two queer people who are together and have good chemistry must automatically be shipped together. Queer people find embrace, solidarity, and acceptance among each other. Automatically assuming that Riley showing kindness and empathy towards Abbie means that they must get together has a very limited view of how queer people interact with each other.",k2ctta

My biggest two complaints are that 'evil sister' was a bit too antagonistic for her change in the end to be believable and Harper was a real ass to Abby and I had a really hard time forgiving her.

What saved the movie for me were the more serious scenes, like Riley telling Abby about her past relationship with Harper, or Dan Levy's character talking to Abby about coming out.  I'm  not gay, but that scene made me cry a bit.   I wanted Abby to end up with Riley, but can see why they had her end up with Harper in the end, but if Abby hadn't taken her back, etc...

Daniel Levy's character was clearly just written to fit as David from Schitt's Creek so eh, didn't work for me, didn't seem genuine.

Second half was a little better. I liked the commentary it made in standing up for family and fhat coming out can be as normalized as marriage problems. I found myself not wanting to turn it off because I at least wanted to see what happened.

ge4yy2i,"Yeah, I am so happy to see some other people felt like this. I personally lived through something a lot like what Abby did, with the betrayals and bad treatment, which you can maybe ultimately pin on a closeted person struggling with their repression... and I ALSO forgave the person and gave her another chance... then was married to her for two years that ultimately only served to burn me down the rest of the way to the water line :/

It was such a sweet movie in lots of ways, but I SO was happy to see Abby stick up for herself, and when she finally just admitted she wanted to be with someone who was ready to BE together. And the thought that she might have even wound up with Riley also made me so happy just thinking about it <3 And to have Harper just show up, make a nice speech, and talk her into another go... I found it really traumatized me all over again having such a critical LGBTQ+ movie glorify that kind of thing.

I mean of course it isn't like someone CAN'T turn over a new leaf and just be a decent person on a dime, but I think it's crazy rare, and the idea that it's somehow a reasonable thing to bank on has seriously hurt way more people than just me. I wanna see movies that normalize that you don't HAVE to try to make it work with this same person after that big a heartbreak. There is nothing wrong with both parties trying again with someone who DIDN'T do all this shit to you, or go through this pain that you caused by being shitty (it's often best for both to just cut the cord and start again).",k2ctta

I was so happy when Harper finally came out and ""picked"" Abby only for Abby to coldly tell her it was too late. I thought the movie was really going to follow up on that -- on how Harper was a bad partner totally separate to her closetedness. I was really hoping at the gas station that Abby would really highlight this but no cigar.  
  
I still like a perfect happy ending where they make up, but this movie really could have gone either way. Abby ending up single or with Riley would have brought more depth at the expense of the feel-good happy ending. Both are equally good, I think.",k2ctta
gdyw41v,I agree. I kept hating Harper for this. She brought Abby down and then told her what five minutes from the house that she wasn't out to her family.

They really could have resolved them by having not having Harper's friends and family basically ignore Abby and instead have Abby be the one being distant from them. Like at the first party instead of the 2 girls straight up ignoring Abby and her fake a phone call that they didn't even care about, have them be semi interested in her and have her fake the phone call because of being awkward or whatever. Then at the bar have Harper leave with Abby and be resentful that she wasn't hanging out with her high school friends she hasn't seen in a while.

I would have connected with Plaza and get as far away from her family and get as far away from Harper as possible. They were all such insufferable ass holes and the one person and the one sister who actually did have a good heart but was a little awkward was flat out neglected. 

This movie had a lot of good will going for it, and then just ruined it with the false-happy ending. But loved Stewart, Levy, and Plaza.

gdwhxud,"This is my favorite comment in this...there's clearly a cut of this movie where Stewart ends up with Plaza. The ending with the family just suddenly coming together and being good people was pretty clearly a last minute decision that messes with the entire tone of the movie. 

I enjoyed watching this movie simply because I like yelling at stupid characters acting completely unrealistically stupid through an entire movie. There were at least 8 points where a rational woman would've been like ""Nope, screw this"" but Kristen Stewart stayed every time lol.",k2ctta

gh2x5y1,Exactly.  The movie should have invested more in their relationship.

ghyqlka,"For sure. I really feel for Harper's situation, I get just not being able to come out to your family. But the way the movie tried to almost frame Harper basically flirting with Connor as an equivalent to Abby spending time with Riley felt way off base, the two aren't comparable at all ESPECIALLY after Abby already told her at the dinner that it made her uncomfortable. 

I felt bad for Harper right until she got outed, and then tried to bury it again. You know your girlfriend wants you to come out, you've had her basically pretending to be a charity case for this family, you know she hates Christmas **because of her parents' deaths**, and when push came to shove (literally) you rebuke her. Nah, you don't get to make up for that with an apology. 

Also the turn around time on the parents just felt super forced ""have to have a happy ending for this holiday movie"". Honestly, the best case scenario is that when he got that phonecall saying that as long as Harper basically hid her gayness he could win the election is that he would think that's perfectly reasonable and then get irrationally upset when Harper / Abby tell him that's unfair, and accuse them of being selfish.",k2ctta

No. That’s not how ANY of that works.",k2ctta
gftnx0l,"This. In what world is this ever going to be a healthy relationship? 

Imagine Harper is a dude. He lies to his family about his girlfriend. He lies to his girlfriend about his family (and whether they know about her). He ignores her at multiple family parties, spends two or three evenings chatting with his ex, and even goes out drinking with the ex. Then he stands by as his family accuses his girlfriend of stealing and shuns her from future events. No way is this going to end with them as a happy couple.

I get it -- coming out to conservative families is hard. But you can't lie about to your partner for months and only tell her after she's in the car, on the way to Christmas with the fam. That's a big breach of consent, which is super important in the LGBT community (and should be for everyone).",k2ctta

Jane is hands down the MVP.",k2ctta

I do think they might have made Harper a bit too unlikable though.

ggfflmr,"I agree with most of your points. 

There are a few things I didn't like about Harper's behaviour (spending all night with an ex without a good explanation and when they're still into you is a big no no), but they got it right when they mentioned that her behaviour was 99% about her and her relationship with her parents. It affects Abby, for sure, but it wasn't about her. I'm not excusing her behaviour, but it's not necessarily a reason to run away.

This is what a complex relationship looks like. There are a lot of moving parts, they're figuring it out, and are growing together. I'm surprised they showed this in a whitish family (a lot of gay and straight people I've been around have been judgemental about grown women who haven't come out to their parents yet) to be honest.

gdu9uvu,"yeah the ending was a bit over the top for me. Not the main couple getting back together, thats expected for the genre, but the family getting past all their biases and feuds in like 2 days was too much for me. The parents ended up having no hangups at all (at least not on camera) about their daughter's sexuality, and then the sisters make up 100% and are buddy buddy all of a sudden? They were at eachothers throats all movie and Allison Brie crossed some major lines.

gdz6i69,">She said she would try to get Abby to love Christmas, then she does nothing at all to make Christmas special.

I think the idea was that when Harper spontaneously invited Abby to visit her family over Christmas, she was happy and confident and in love, in a place where she felt comfortable and could be herself, and just said what she was feeling. She really wanted to do those things, and she momentarily forgot that her situation was different at home.

By the next day, reality had set in and she tried to dissuade Abby from coming, because I think she realised that her optimistic vision of getting Abby to love Christmas again with her family was not how it was going to go. It stopped being about what she wanted (to enjoy Christmas with her girlfriend), and just became a matter of surviving the situation. Then once they got there, she unconsciously regressed into unhealthy behaviours that she learned during childhood, repressing her true feelings at every turn, and lashing out when the guilt became too much. She overcompensated and distanced herself completely.

If she were thinking more rationally I think she could have found a way to keep her secret without being so neglectful, and they could have at least enjoyed Christmas events together as ""friends"", but she was making some very poor decisions due to fear.",k2ctta
gi5ucir,Exactly how I envisioned a better version too,k2ctta
hnyoyh4,"I really enjoyed reading this.

That's a great point: Sometimes, saying ""no"" is more about yourself than whomever is being told ""no."" If that person is someone you love, it's incredibly painful (another example would be the movie trope where a character must leave the love of his life because he doesn't want to endanger her life). I've never cried so hard and for so long in any movie, and it's largely because there's so much in this movie that resonated with me and I could relate to.

Yeah, both Harper and Abby had good reasons behind their choices. It's just unfortunate that the choices weren't compatible. That's how life is and maturity can be measured by how one deals with challenge—loss and  misfortunes included—and thereby how one adapts; do you face and accept reality or do you deny and evade it? This is grit applied to relationships.

I actually enjoyed the happy ending. I probably would also enjoy the tragic ending.

After this movie, I have a total crush on Kristen Stewart too. 🥰 Her outfits were also on point. 😆😍",k2ctta
gfwabvm,"Perfect ending would've been Abby and Harper taking a break to let Harper actually think about her actions then coming back together later on ***or*** them just not getting back together at all: a fast forward to next Christmas with John meeting up with Abby and Riley, Harper spending time with her family who have mended things between themselves and came to terms.",k2ctta

Nope, just go back to the awful partner just cuz she begged and things didn’t go her way. Just awful. Not cute, not heartwarming. Just... god",k2ctta
gewtd00,Im actually saddened by the ending because it seemed like they were setting it up to be a movie about cutting out abusers. Like Harper is dealing with trauma but so is every abuser. People shouldn't be taught to just deal with it -- especially queer people!! It's pretty sick ending actually. :+(,k2ctta
gf02mpa,"Agreed, Harper's bad traits alone could fill a novel yet she's meant to be seen as the protagonist. Let's see - 

She lied to Abby about her home life & didn't tell her until they were halfway through a long car ride & Abby literally could not escape. She blindsided her into that house & gave her like 30 minutes to prepare to live a lie, then cracked jokes at her expense for being a bad liar. Like..bitch. 

Harper let her family accuse Abby of being a thief & didn't lift a finger to correct them. That ""well if my brooch does show up on my dresser there'll be no questions asked"" line boiled my piss & I would have lost it. 

Harper clearly hurt people in her past, she threw Riley to the wolves & let an entire high school believe she was an unwelcome stalker rather than tell the truth. Fucking. Yikes. It's implied she hurt the ex boyfriend & left him without closure too, as he seems pretty hurt when he goes to her & asks her to explain what happened to him. She probably hurt more people that we don't even know about. 

Harper, after literally trapping her girlfriend in an abusive household, abandoned her & threw her under the bus. Just left her to fend for herself in a confusing new environment where the shining twins are doing their best to give her a criminal record & the parents of the house literally won't look her in the eye. Went & hung around with everyone except abby. 

Then after soft-ghosting her in this terrible situation Abby reaches out to her for help for the first time, she says 'you're suffocating me.' Like damn Abby didn't even consent to being there, you literally tricked & trapped her there under false pretences & you then have the audacity to call her suffocating? No. Just no. 

When Harper finds out that her sister was going through a divorce, literally the first thing she did was say ""yeeessss, I can use this to blackmail you!"" Not 'oh god that's awful' or 'I'm sorry' but ""I'm going to use this against you."" I know that Sloane was a bitch but come on girl that's your sister

Harper would prefer to literally fistfight her own sister in front of Abby than she would to come out. That fight scene was so heartbreaking. Imagine it from Abby's perspective, she's looking at the woman she loves rolling around on the floor beating her sister with various household objects because she doesn't want to admit she's with her. Yikes man. Yikes. Is that going to come up in the wedding speech? ""Haha honey remember that time I garrotted my sister with tinsel because I didn't want anyone to know I was with you? Ah, memories.""

The painting. I went back & rewatched the ending scene & when Harper slams that painting that the pure sweet innocent sister spent a hundred hours earnestly making over Sloane's head, she wasn't even provoked. There was a minute or two of silence & stillness then Harper just goes from 0-100 cavewoman  & whams it over Sloane's head for no other reason than..she's a bitch. Again, imagine physically seeing the woman you love do that in front of you do that rather than admit she's with you. 

& at the end of all this? It was all 100% completely fucking unnecessary. Harper lives in a state where she can face no bad consequences for coming out. She did all this not because she had to, but because she was a coward. It's 2020 in pittsburgh. Not Russia. Girl you can come out you idiot there is literally nothing stopping you

& when she is forced out of the closet? Absolutely nothing happens. She's cuddling on the sofa with her girlfriend five minutes later, accepted by everyone. They get engaged because that's been legal there for ages. Like...what the fuck girl you just emotionally traumatised about 4 people for Absolutely. No. Reason. 

So after spending an hour thirty minutes gaslighting, manipulating, lying, mentally/emotionally abusing, blindsiding, railroading, abandoning, blackmailing, literally beating up, dismissing, extorting, & generally fucking with people..Harper gets a happy ending. 

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

I don't even think Harper's constant assertions that she was going to come out 'after Christmas' were true. I think she would have found a way to weasel out of it. She's such a casual liar, dropping big lies & little lies with every breath, there's no reason to believe she was actually going to do the right thing. 

& even if she did, how is it acceptable to place more value on not 'spoiling' the parents precious Christmas than on your apparent partner's right to live openly as their true identity? To Harper, Xmas was more important than her girlfriend's identity. Literally. Priorities? 

Gay people have spent thousands of years having our identities stomped into the dust, we don't really want to see a movie where for 1 hour 30 mins Xmas cheer > our existence.

The scene where Harper is, in classic narcissist fashion, saying ""I did it!"" And expecting Abby to take her back, and Abby says no. I was like ""yes!"" -- it was so triumphant and I was so excited to get a movie that says NO to abusers, with a main character who has supportive friends who come to help remove them from abuse with no questions asked.

Then the ending is completely off the rails. I legit think that those pigs in hollywood said, ""this movie is too radical"" and changed the ending because it has nothing to do with what they set up. And you're exactly right that queer kids will see this and think they should also rush into abusive relationships and recreate patriarchal oppressions and all that shit. And I think that was the point of the ending. To recreate a culture of abuse",k2ctta

gfxrxvi,"As someone on the spectrum I think she did have a few ASD traits. The fixation on her worldbuilding & being unable to tell when the person she's talking to about it being uncomfortable is one. Her social awkwardness & prowess with technology being another. The occasional inappropriate action or sentence. The fact that she was mentioned as biting people in her childhood, which can be another trait. 

The parents mentioned 'giving up on her' which when you think about how -old- & ignorant they were, is absolutely in keeping with the fact that Jane is probably an autistic female who went undiagnosed into adulthood - it happens a lot with women. They are far more often passed off as 'quirky' rather than being given the tests that they need by their parents. Given how shitty the parents were overall, I can absolutely see Jane not being given the evaluation she needs & her parents not having the faintest clue what ASD is.

I told my parents I was trans about 4 years ago and I've been on HRT for almost as long; they still won't acknowledge it at all and while I'm out to my friends, it's really hard to fully come out when you still love your parents and want a somewhat-functional relationship with them and your family.

Think the film might have been better served by having the same epilogue with them being supportive, but not showing them immediately being perfect in days. Trying to be nice, maybe.  

Happiest Season gave me a lot of complicated feelings in general, since I pretend to be a completely normal dude in a fair bit of my life, and that naturally extends to asking my girlfriend to 'play along' in family situations.

It's not perfect from a story structure or writing standpoint, but loved that the representation felt natural and that they got such good actresses for all the roles.

I was wondering about the tracker thing too. Just what did the friend put on her phone that allows him to easily know exactly where she is? Is it a chip? Is it software? I'm genuinely curious, & how did Harper get it too? Shouldn't Abby be saying 'um guys how are you all doing this'",k2ctta

Then I remind myself that it was made for a primarily heterosexual audience that in all likelihood would have no clue how common this is, and that the movie portrays a wlw relationship just like a heteronormative relationship would be shown in other similar Christmas feel-good movies. Romcoms are by and large not meant to show healthy relationships, because those don't sell as many tickets. It's a problem endemic to the genre, not this movie in particular. Granted, it could have tried to do better, but to paraphrase us both, toxic relationships put butts in seats.

I didn't catch that Jane was ASD-coded, but I'm not too great at picking up things like that. It does make a bit of sense now that you mention it.

We have LOTS of ways to understand her family did a major number on her for a long time though, I kinda think people aren't connecting the dots between *her* weird thing and how weird her sisters are too. 

I felt a little like DuVall wanted to be gracious about not presenting Harper’s parents as monsters just because they're conservative, but maybe she needed to be a bit more explicit in how shitty they've really been. I feel like a lot of people are missing the markers dropped here and there about why Harper thinks she has no other options.",k2ctta

gdud1v9,For me I didn't mind the closeted arc I just hate how Harper treated Abby the whole time. First she lied about coming out (the first time). Then she asked Abby to come knowing full well that she would have to pretend to be straight. She then ignored Abby to flirt with Conner(?) and said that Abby was suffocating her even though Harper had been ignoring her. It definitely did not help that they had no chemistry at all nor did she have any character traits. Having dated in closeted situations neither my partners nor I ever acted the way Harper did.  I think a lot of this also boils down to subpar writing. If they had taken out the Conner part they'd have more time to flesh out their relationship and Harper's actions would feel a little more understandable.,k2ctta
gduzpf6,"> Another thing I noticed: There is a lot of criticism towards Harper's character (i.e., ditching Abby to hang out with her straight friends), which some sense, and the manner that she prioritized her family over Abby for a good part of the film. I want to share that coming out to family is so complicated—it is not a linear process. I am trying to see Harper's perspective with compassion and patience. I know some queer people who are incredibly close to their family, and they have put their queerness aside to maintain that connection and not lose their family. It's not my place to judge.

Yeah, I am glad that you try to empathize with Harper, and I really appreciate your perspective.",k2ctta
gdve2l4,"I quite agree - I have the pleasure of being so blatantly queer that the closet isn't really a thing, and even I got uncharacteristically choked up at that conversation about coming out.

gezyer4,"Harper didn't so muck -ask- Abby to go into that situation as she did completely railroaded her into it.  Harper lied to Abby & told her she was out, got Abby halfway through like an eight hour car ride where Abby had no chance to turn back or escape, -then- hit her with the surprise. Harper both tricked & forced Abby into a situation she did not consent to & it was skeevy as hell. Made me really mad. Abby literally could not escape (1000 dollar uber ride) & was essentially imprisoned in an abusive house until her friend came to rescue her. 

I also agree with the 2020 thing. I could understand the desperation to stay in the closet if it was the 80s, 90s, 00s, but 2020? No. It felt anachronistic. Harper lives in a place/time where she would face no consequences for coming out but she acted like she was living in Russia next door to a Gulag or something. That evil lady's speech at the end wouldn't even hold up because in that state you could be sued into the ground for discriminating against homosexuality. 

Then when she was forced out of the closet, what happened to her? Absolutely nothing. Five minutes later she was cuddling with her girlfriend on the sofa  & the world continued to turn. Harper put multiple people through emotional trauma for years (Riley, the boyfriend, abby & who knows who else) for -absolutely no reason- other than her own cowardice.

Almost the entire movie was spent showing Harper neglecting Abbie and treating her like trash, even if it was out of fear of being rejected by her family, that’s not how you treat the person you love. I didn’t think Harper was on the same page as Abbie so it just didn’t seem like a good fit. Also, aside from the chemistry between Aubrey Plaza and Kristen Stewart, Riley was shown being there for Abbie and being supportive to her so it definitely seemed like there was something there.

But it wasn’t just about her not coming out. If that had been the only big thing it would have been forgivable. It was the fact that Harper spent the *entire* movie being inconsiderate of her girlfriend’s feelings. She lied in the first place about having already come out to her parents, and then didn’t tell Abby until they were on the way there? And instead of ever making time for Abby, she abandons her at every social gathering and then gets jealous when she becomes friends with Riley. When she decided to spend a whole night with her ex and then lashed out at Abby for smothering her I lost it. I wish they’d shown more of Harper’s perspective and her fear of coming out but instead I just watched her treat her partner like shit for over an hour and it became impossible to sympathize.

The little jabs from the mom about what a shame it is for Riley etc, Harper comes from a real shitshow family and the person she reverts to around them is the person she had to be to grow up with them. All of that feels pretty real and recognisable to me, I don't have to see Victor Garber fundraising with Westboro Baptist to get it.

Straight people are also nice to each other even when they don't want sex, so it's equally true that two straight people being nice to each other doesn't automatically mean sparks are flying; but it's obviously a common thing for people to ship people together who seem like they'd make a good couple even if they're not one and there's no reason to think they'd make a good couple other than that they're cute together/people want to see the drama that would ensure.

Being in the closet is usually centered around fear and as progressive as we like to think the world is, it's far from being a safe place for those who go against the grain.

I myself have never come out to a family member and never will. My traditional caribbean family isn't the one to test the waters with and I know my safety and well-being being will definitely be in jeopardy if I did. I know far too many Jamaicans and Trinis who made the mistake of coming out and have had it used against them (a friend couldn't go to school after dad refused to pay tuition one semester because she cut her hair and looked ""like a dyke"" so she had to get box braids until it grew out and isn't aloud to wear pants anymore.)

I know like more than a handful of guys and girls, who have been kicked out and completely disowned without a penny in their name.

Covid took my job and both of my roommates so I had to move all the way back home while trying to get on my feet and I for sure have taken steps to ensure no one would dare to question me being straight because I'm not in a place where I could pick myself up if they were to toss me out on my ass.

Sometimes, coming out is far more worse than being in the closet.",k2ctta

I find it irritating that people think any two queer people who have good chemistry together must automatically be paired together. It’s so limiting, small minded, and puts all queer people in a box. Queer people have vastly different relationships among each other and it’s clear many people in this thread don’t have queer relationships. I didn’t find anything inherently sexual between between Abbie and Riley because they to me looked like two queer woman who finding comfort among each other’s company during a difficult time of the year for many and finding a friendly shoulder to lean on.

I also wish the movie hadn’t also framed her friends as being homophobic too. They had Harper throw Riley under the bus in high school (which was an incredibly shitty thing to do that I don’t feel Riley would be okay with by the end when Harper got outed), when it would’ve been a tough enough situation already for Harper to come out to her family.",k2ctta

gftmnx2,"This. She's denying her girlfriend exists, letting her get treated like garbage by her family, ditching her at event after event after event, and goes out drinking with her ex where they flirt much of the night? We were basically shouting at the screen for Abby to leave her the whole movie. And Harper only even hinted that all these difficulties were coming... after Abby was already in the car! That's a huge breach of communication and consent.

The ending felt totally unrealistic and tacked on and, imho, only works in the mind of a straight person who thinks of LGBT relationships as difficult and dysfunctional by default. Certainly, coming out to family is hard, but nobody should have to be treated like that by their future spouse. 

Just imagine Harper is a dude. There's no way the audience cheers for them to get back together after he ditches his girlfriend, flirts with his ex, lies, and shrugs when his family calls her ""poor"" (and accuses her of stealing), then shuns her from parties.",k2ctta

It also would've helped if Davis had some decent charisma with Stewart; we're shown in the opening montage that they're happy, and Abby and Harper both seem happy at the start with each other (Abby wants to propose, Harper wants her to have a great Christmas), but the actress isn't quite up to embodying that and really showing us their strong foundation.",k2ctta

gggczin,"I personally think things might have looked better for Harper if she had come out to Connor—and that was why they were out so late—she was confiding in him and sharing what went wrong with their relationship. 

Or even just accidentally gushing about Abby after a few drinks. 

Or even on the sidewalk, when he asks where they went wrong, she comes out to him, and he respects that and keeps her secret. 

Or I was even hoping he’d come out and Harper would find the courage to do so as well! (And then Connor and John could end up together). 

I think something along these lines to that scene would have better shown Harper was simply struggling, but loved Abby and did want to be open about it. It also would have made hanging out until 2 am with her ex more understandable, in my eyes. 

I also was frustrated because, even though I get Harper’s behavior—she wasn’t just being a bad partner, but she was being a bad friend. If I had invited my actual roommate to come home with me for Christmas, I would have tried to include them and check in with them frequently and stand up for them when my family accused them of stealing. I get why Harper didn’t do those things, but still—not cool as a friend or girlfriend!",k2ctta

I think that's a step in the right direction towards respecting neurodiversity: Note how Jane is only awkward if one accepts the premise that conventional norms are necessarily the standard—or that mental health is measured by the statistical average. Autists can also have perfectly valid and rational perspectives and it's often just that: differences in perspectives between the neurodivergent and neurotypicals (of course, that's not to imply that neurodivergence precludes fallacious views or unhealthy thinking habits, but we should seek understanding before judging; also, don't forget that many of humankind's greatest minds were and are autistic).",k2ctta

gdxj8oi,"I think my issue was that, if that's true of the parents, Harper should have known this and come out to them before introducing them to her girlfriend. The movie makes it seem like she knows her parents well enough to know how they would react. It just makes Harper seem even worse.

I've been in the position where I met a boy's parents at Christmas while he was in the closet and I know what it's like first hand, to have toxic parents. With my parents, coming out had to happen after moving out because otherwise I'd be kicked out. With my bf then it was that they would stop paying for his college degree and cut him off financially.

I guess my issue is, in the movie there's nothing at stake for her to have been in the closet from them for so long as an adult. Idk I hated the movie TBH",k2ctta

ge3eauc,"Yeah, I think DuVall tried to do the whole ""show, don't tell"" thing, but it wasn't terribly effective and people end up missing out on making the connection. For example - the impression I got was that Harper's kind of... disconnected from her old life, mentioning the boilerplate stuff to Abby but not going in much details. She definitely mentioned Riley to Abby, but did she even talk about her ""best friends"" from high school? She wasn't particularly looking out for them when she was home for the holidays, either - they came to her. 

I think the movie would have been better if we spent a bit more time with Abby and Harper *before* the trip, just to highlight how much of a pressure cooker being home is for Harper and how being in that environment led her to being the shitty friend and girlfriend she ended up being for most of the movie. 

Which actually brings me back to my first point about ""show, don't tell"". We're *told* that Abby and Harper have been together for a year now and Abby is head over heels enough that she wants to propose. But we're not *shown* much beyond the first scene where Harper invites Abby home with her for Christmas. The rest of the movie then shows Harper behave very poorly.",k2ctta
gdv6xji,"Yeah, as soon as we started seeing the dynamics of the family I just kept thinking about how it's no wonder she's still hiding it. It really sucks that Abby was caught in the crossfire. I feel like not everyone is taking on board the importance of John's monologue. Sure, Harper probably didn't deserve forgiveness for the things she did, at least not right away. But I think she deserves some understanding and compassion given the hand she was dealt with her family.

People act like it's really easy to stand up to your parents, and that it's no big deal to lose them if they can't love you for who you are. And that was before being gay even came into the picture.",k2ctta
ggjx3vu,"You missed the internalized complexities of each individual if you can simplify things that way. 
Also, Abby also agreed to go along with this. She could have stopped the car as soon as Harper told her her parents didn't know.

It's an incredibly common trope in romance movies for the distraught, mistreated partner to find a friend who turns out to be mr/Mrs right or turns into the ""lifelong friend who gets me and has my back!""

  


Abby and Riley were seemingly being pushed into the former of those options. She was portrayed as understanding, chill and genuinely wants to have fun. Which are all common reasons a character falls for the side character.

I kind of think how awful this film turned out to be was due to extreme thoughtlessness, not from malice. It may have read half-decently on a script but when put all together on the big screen the message (which I still think was accidental) was too awful to miss. 

I only say this because the director is a prominent lesbian actress & she said she based it on her experiences, which based on her age I can believe. I just think that she should have set the film in the 80s or 90s when her experiences took place, then it may have worked a little better. In the setting & time frame she chose it was anachronistic to the point of being extremely offensive. 

Still one of the most horrible films ever made. But I think it was accidentally horrible so I feel I can't hold it against the actors too much.

I come from a family like Harper’s and while I agree she was a shitty shitty gf I just don’t see how she could have anticipated their reaction as it happened given their prior behavior. My parents have been physically abusive to me over my perceived lesbianism (I’m not out to them yet but I’m out to all of my siblings) yet they were very respectful and even happy for my friend’s transition. There are a lot of different factors and I think Harper is to blame for not telling Abby she wasn’t out until they were on their way home, for abandoning Abby while home both to her family and to old friends, and for doubling down on refusing to come out when she was outed. But not for her responses to her family",k2ctta

geu9nso,"I also thought was painful to watch, mainly from how bad people treated her (and not that she was awkward). I interpret these behaviors from Jane as being very high agreeableness personality traits, not autistic traits. She is just on the high extreme of agreeableness, all her scenes are about being extremely nice, warm and friendly (way too much for her family social circle). It is absolutely not her fault she was surrounded by shitty people, it would not be awkward if people didn't treat her bad (for example, in the holiday party it is her turn to choose and she says ""wooow all these gifts look so nice"" and her mother ""just choose one Jane...""). I also think the movie does a good job of showing something I experience which is if you are too nice, people just step over you, because they know you will not do anything bad back or even stand up for yourself.
I re-watched her scenes to re-assess, and I still think she doesn't have autistic traits, and she was certainly not created to be autistic. I wouldn't be against it if she were though, I think the movie shows her family as being shitty, not her - she is great and everyone that watches loves her.

I’m sure at some point Abby would’ve taken issue with having a relationship Harper’s family didn’t know about, especially if they got married. That’s fair too because keeping things private can get exhausting.

But people deserve the time they need to be ready to come out and share those things with their families. You’re absolutely right that the issue was her *inviting* Abby home from the holidays only to force her into the closet. Not to mention lying to her until they were on their way to the house about her parents knowing.

geahwvy,"But this is happening all over a period of like the first 2 days of being there. If it was a few weeks of erratic behavior, then absolutely. But this is all within a very short amount of time. We all saw they did not get a lot of alone time to properly communicate what they were dealing with while they were there. Could it been handled differently, obviously. But a few mistakes like getting caught up in conversations that make it difficult for you to get back to your partner should not be considered grounds to leave the person you love for. Staying out later with friends while the other wants to go home is also not unheard of. During the holidays on the first time visiting, it definitely is a bit insensitive, but Abby told her she is fine with her staying out longer. What really needed to happen was for Abby and Harper to just go out in the town by themselves one of those days and communicate instead of holding onto all their anger/stress for short bursts where they couldn't fully express their feelings. 

There have been times where I have had my ex over for the holidays and everything gets so hectic within the first few hours of everyone showing up that we got separated in the household. I always made sure to make my way back to him but things get a bit chaotic and you just have to hold on until the holidays are over. I grew up in a very similar family as Harper's and its always stressful around the holidays. Everyone is tense, there is fake cheer everywhere, and we sweep every minor argument under the rug. Its a very difficult environment to grow up in and seeming to make any mistake can lead to incredibly harmful mental health issues. I've been through therapy for my anxiety and if Harper was my friend in real life, I would suggest it to her as well. I can relate to the immense pressure and stress she would be in in this situation. 

The problem with this is that Riley never made any moves or suggestions of them getting together. She was there because she saw Abby going through stress and could recognize it. Laughing together as they destress over a beer in a gay club shouldn't be ""omg they are so cute together!!! they should totally hook up now!"". Queer people can just be friends and form tight connections over shared experiences and feeling each other's vibes. That is exactly what those two were doing. I'm getting major, ""I have a gay friend you should TOTALLY meet! You two should totally date it would be SO cute!!"" vibes from this thread",k2ctta

gdxply6,was she not bad enough as is??,k2ctta
ge0wfy2,Harper is a down-right emotionally abusive character from what we see. She's pretty damn bad,k2ctta
ge9oqqt,"While Riley probably did have an attraction to Abby, I honestly didn't get the impression that Abby was into Riley that way at all. She seemed 100% hung up on Harper the entire movie, which would make sense for her character.

The two of them got along really well and Riley was being a very supportive friend to her, and I enjoyed their dynamic a lot, but I just didn't see it as more than that. Riley never looked like she was planning to make a move, she was too nice to jeopardise someone else's relationship like that.",k2ctta

ge5uqmh,"Personally idgaf about range and I don’t know why so many people do. Not all actors need to be Leonardo DiCaprio, the personality/character that Dan can bring to a project just being different variations of David Rose are invaluable and I’d still love him if that’s all he ever brought to the table as an actor.

As others have said, he stole every scene he was in here vastly improving the movie as a side character despite not demonstrating “range” - that’s plenty for me and I want more!",k2ctta

geajntf,"It’s not a ludicrous or small-minded thought to like the chemistry between Abby & Riley more than Abby & Harper.  They even shot an ending where Abby & Riley ended up together; a romantic connection isn’t completely out of the question just because people start out as friends/confidants.  

And the erratic behavior included gaslighting Abby and calling her suffocating and leaving her alone at every single party she invited her to, even when they could’ve hung out as “friends.”  Her not being out doesn’t really explain all of the rudeness - it would’ve been really hurtful even if they really were just roommates.  I guess I just don’t understand why wanting two friends to end up together is such a malicious and problematic thing.  It doesn’t necessarily mean people want them to be together solely because they’re both queer.",k2ctta

gdyfycf,She was flawed but not evil.,k2ctta
gdzf3ep,"i think the thesis of the movie was about communication and how the breakdown of honest communication can lead to the breakdown of relationships, so honestly it was a two way streak between abby and harpers characters. harper was dealing with coming out while abby was reading too much into harpers actions due to the breakdown of honest communication between the two. remember that abby went from about to propose to harper to about to dump her in like 3 days all because of a series of miscommunications",k2ctta

ge3rmot,"True, but how many exes are truely evil? She put Abby through multiple things that when added up deserve a break-up. Had the writers gone that route, it could have shown Abby and Harper breaking up, Harper growing on her own and that family growing too, and Abby getting over the relationship,  possibly getting better-aquainted with Riely and possibly dating her. And then at the end, Abby and Harper run into each other, are able to make some amends but fully move on from each othe (like what Riely and Harper did). Not a Christmasy ending, though.",k2ctta

gfy5h4a,"Yes. There is nothing that can excuse that behaviour. The person I had said argument with seemed not unlike a person you'd see on r/tumblrinaction.
