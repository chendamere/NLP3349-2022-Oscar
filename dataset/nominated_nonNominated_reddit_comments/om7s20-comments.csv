h5kfj07,The scene where he's talking about that hot shot chef's dream of opening a pub and the camera never leaves the chef's face as his soul just dies and leaves his body will be a contender for most memorable moment in a 2021 movie.,om7s20

h5r2mj6,"Amir keeps listening to that audionarration about why classical music is great and will last forever. When we get to his Dad's house, classical music is playing. Amir is trying to emulate his invincible father even though he himself probably doesn't like the music. In the end he finally shuts off the narration and allows himself to mourn his mother in a way his father never would.

Fantastic film.",om7s20
h5lop8s,"Underrated moment: Robin stealing the bike and then rage screaming at the owner before the owner has a chance to even say, ""Hey, that's my bike!"" and then riding off.",om7s20
h5j8rpa,"I was incredibly impressed with this movie. The way this was executed was just perfect for me. At first you think it's going to be like John Wick or Taken, especially with the descent into the underworld at Edgar's place. But then you find out who Rob really is and it just completely changes everything.

Him using his cooking skills and history to talk to people and break them down was incredible to watch, and the parallels between the loss of Apple to Amir's mom was very well done. Fantastic meditation on loss and grief, cannot recommend this enough.",om7s20
h5jizen,"Really enjoyed the movie overall. Could have easily just been standard revenge porn, cause revenge is a satisfying fantasy to watch. But I'm so happy it was so much more than that. Has a lot to say about loss and pursuing happiness.

That said, do have a question and feel like I missed something. What was up with the fighting pit? Some place where we people pay money to hit people and watch people get hit? How did that tie in to Robyn's backstory? I didn't really hear the few lines he talked about it. I'm confused cause he was obviously known for being an amazing chef. I just got lost in how taking hits for money tied into all of that, and it really only played in for the first 1/3 of the movie.",om7s20
h5lg810,"“Fuck Seattle.”

10/10

I really like how, because we’ve been groomed to think this way, that a violent scene is about to happen and he just handles it with words. Very nice change of pace. I want to see it again soon to soak more of it in.",om7s20
h5q8lge,"There's an undeniably powerful sub-theme that highlights the different ways in which people handle grief:
1) Rob: he shares with Amir in the diner that he feels as though if he never looked for his pig, she would still be alive in his head. He wishes he could have taken the ""ignorance is bliss"" approach after already experiencing crippling grief from his wife's passing.
2) Amir: He tries to convince himself that his mom is dead, and mentions this to Rob. It's easier for him to think of her in past tense.
3) Amir's Dad: following his self-serving tendencies, he delays his wife's death (to her detriment) in an attempt to presumably delay the grief that would come with it.

One last thought: though I was initially crushed for Rob at the end, I think Amir provides him with enough purpose to make it through, even if that means seeing him once every Thursday. Rob gave Amir some crucial fatherly experiences (e.g. showing him how to cook the meal at his dad's home) and Amir gave Rob care and conversation that he hadn't experienced in years. He's not alone, it's just the start of his third chapter of love.",om7s20
h5k7qbc,All of us Nicolas Cage fans finally getting vindication as people start to realize/remember that he is a very good actor,om7s20
h7g7vmb,"Me watching this move with no prior info: 

5 minutes in: okay cool it's about a guy and his pig in the 1800s

15 minutes in: okay cool it's like taken but with a pig and not actually in the 1800s

30 minutes in: okay it's like john wick but with a pig

1 hour in: okay it's like ratatouille with a pig

1.5 hours in: okay it's none of those things and actually about coping with the loss of a loved one",om7s20
h5lmho1,"Robin said he remembers every meal he’s ever cooked and every person he’s ever served.

Robin cooked the same meal that Amir’s father and mother had the night they came back very happy and drunk. Causes the father to emotionally breakdown. 

I’m not entirely sure the deeper meaning behind the persimmon tree scene. This juxtaposition of this sweet boy showing Cage this instrument and Cage looking like a deranged bloody homeless man is something else though. 

“I don’t think we have a persimmon tree.”

“No? That’s okay.”

“Did it die?”

…

There’s also the moment when he yells at the dude after he swipes the bike. 

Small tidbit - Laurie died in 2004, which would be 15 years from of 2019. He had left industry 15 years ago. 

Beautiful cinematography and definitely a story that will make you ponder the themes for a while. It certainly wasn’t the movie I was expecting based on the trailer but that’s not a bad thing.",om7s20
h5jm883,"Without a doubt this is the best movie that I've seen since the theatres reopened.    
If you haven't seen this yet, go see it!  This director is amazing!    
And Nicholas Cage is absolutely fantastic.  This is his best performance since Leaving Las Vegas.  I really hope that either Cage or Alex Wolff get nominated for awards!  They deserve it.",om7s20
h5j639h,"This isn’t the kind of movie that a lot of people expect it to be, but it’s pretty damn good nonetheless.

h5kuwoc,"This was an astoundingly nice little film.  And we need more of this.  More MCU and Antman is fine, but these little weird movies have so much love to give.

h5j5zff,"I saw it last night. It was a very good movie, but my favorite part was as I was walking out of the theater, I heard the couple in front of me talking. The woman said, ""Man, we shoulda gone to see Space Jam. This was some weird shit.""",om7s20

h5mbe6n,"Ok so I just watched this with my partner. During the movie we thought it was a odd but a beautiful story. At the end, or the 'reveal' my partner burst into tears because she felt so sorry for him, she has only ever cried from one other movie, so this was a very rare reaction. When the credits rolled she quietly cried again. Did anyone else have this same reaction? I felt a slight sense of sorrow, but definitely far from tears myself.",om7s20

h5j63bo,I hope everyone that likes to meme on Nic Cage watches this movie. Dude is an incredible actor. He's probably not going to get an Oscar for this performance but he deserves one.,om7s20
h5kn3l0,"Caught this in Philly earlier today. The fullest i've ever seen the indie theater since Shape of Water. Did the entire film look a bit washed out and too bright to anyone else?

Fantastic acting, fantastic screenwriting. I teared up a few times. As somebody else here said, it leaves a lot unsaid and expects the audience to pay attention to clues and things said in passing to have a full understanding of the situation. I also appreciated how it used comedy- even in grief, sometimes shit is just funny. The film also played with my expectations with dividing it into two parts. There was no three act structure. The second part never ends. There is no chapter for resolution. The first part is when he has his pig and the second part is the rest of his life when she is taken from him. Brooding.

I also felt that the film had some good commentary on gentrification and catering to a rich but tasteless audience. 

Funny things in the credits: pig is credited about halfway through but does not appear in cast in order of appearance. The dishes served in the film have credits right at the end. Special thanks to Janet Weiss (rocky horror? Lol)",om7s20
h5kzmko,"How is no one talking about the 200 year cycle earthquake/volcano foreshadowing? I was almost certain the movie was going to end with a startling rumble, as the music plays from the 'for Robin' tape.",om7s20
h6sig3s,"As i was watching, i grew frustrated by Robin not washing his wounds on his face that were clearly becoming infected and gross. it wasn’t until the very end that he learns about his pig and walks home that he washes his face in the creek, and i immediately understood. it felt like in solidarity, he wouldn’t take care of himself until he could take care of this animal that he loved. it made me very emotional along with the cassette tape of his wife right after. very beautiful movie.",om7s20
h5j5z2g,"I found this movie absolutely fascinating. The performances felt real and raw, the screenplay was tight, and the score was progressive and moving. I’m happy Cage is getting praise and I look forward to seeing more from Sarnoski.",om7s20
h5jfujl,"This was one of my favorite movies of the last decade.

The themes about grief, loss, purpose, and meaning in life aren't novel, but the absurdity of the premise as well as many of the scenes themselves slips the themes into your consciousness in a way that *really* worked for me. I didn't realize I'm thinking about weighty topics until after their heft was embedded in my mind.",om7s20
h5jfcu5,I was not expecting to like this movie so much. It definitely was the surprise of the year so far. I thought it was going to be more horror based off the poster but was pleasantly surprised with a character driven drama.,om7s20
h5kw7sx,"A great little movie that somehow turns its absurd premise on its head by transforming into a beautiful mediation on purpose and grief.

&#x200B;

I was worried by the 'secret society'/fight club aspect of it, and still feel that was needlessly stupid. But thankfully the film recovers from that odd misstep as soon as we meet the other chef.

&#x200B;

The surprising interactions between Rob (Cage), Chef Finway (David Knell) and Darius (Adam Arkin) were the highlights of the film. It was also touching to see a paternal relationship slowly develop between Rob and Amir (Wolff) - I particularly liked the scene where he asks the baker for another loaf just so he could give it to him.",om7s20
h5kmul6,Could anybody try and explain the significance of the culinary Fight Club they had where Robin got punched in the face for a minute? Cause that part really confused me.,om7s20
h5jyv5p,"Had me incredibly emotional. One of the most beautiful and profound films I've seen in some time, definitely my favorite of the year thus far. It was such a fascinating odyssey through a what felt like a new slice of the world. When he told that chef about his pub dream I shed a tear, and by the time he cooks that meal for Wolff's father I was in full on tears.",om7s20
h5j7m7p,"Didn't know much about it and the first part got me thinking it was gonna be a more violent revenge film. But what we got was possibly the most subdued revenge movie and a unique character piece that was made for Nicolas Cage. 

Rob's breakdown when hearing about the fate of his pig was such a gut punch and reading about Nic Cage's channeling his nightmares about his cat passing away made it all even more heartbreaking.

What a confident debut by Michael Sarnoski, I can't wait for his next project.",om7s20
h5lk9ck,Cage gives the best performance of the year so far.,om7s20
h5nim66,"Before watching this movie I jokingly said Nic Cage would win his second Oscar for it. After watching it he at the very least deserves a nomination for Best Actor. Shades of grief reminiscent of his Oscar winning performance in Leaving Las Vegas.

I never thought I’d ever root for someone portraying a grief stricken pig owning hermit truffle farmer master chef. Here’s to your next Best Actor nod Nic. See you at the Oscars.",om7s20
h5jtpvp,"The movie sets you up to expect an action revenge movie like John Wick, and then goes in a very different direction.

I personally enjoyed the direction they went, but I totally understand if people weren't fans of it. I've seen a lot of action revenge movies, so this movie was a pleasant surprise.

Nic Cage was great, especially his scene with that chef who had worked under him.",om7s20
h5kmju3,"I said this in another thread, but 2 thoughts while watching this:

It’s like John Wick, but instead of weapons, Nic Cage uses beautifully curated meals and existential dread. 

It’s like Ratatouille, but Nic Cage is the rat.",om7s20
h5k8zaq,"This film really took me by surprise, it was very fresh.

It has a huge amount of heart and is one of the better films I’ve seen this year.

Nicolas Cage really nailed it in his solemn understated performance. 


9/10.",om7s20
h5kpcqw,"Great movie, absolutely hated the “get punched with your arms behind your back” scene.",om7s20
h5pzomy,"The whole meaning of this movie really caught me off guard, and it really drives home the point of that there are few things in life you actually care about and should focus on.

Standout scenes with surprisingly very little talking, just excellent editing and acting:

* Cage talking to the 5 star successful chef about the pub he never opened. Damn, I was rooting for that guy. I know this is a fictional movie but the range of emotions that actor went through in that scene it was like you were right there with him and I left the movie hoping he went and opened that pub.

* Cage cooking that meal for the father who stole the pig and literally zero speaking, just a powerful performance as you can see him go through the emotions that the food brought back into his life by bringing up old memories. This scene ONLY worked as powerful as it did because about 15 minutes earlier there was a previous scene with such a simple yet powerful line of dialogue, ""Have you always been this way, or only after she died?""

All I am saying is I thought this was going to be a slow burn comedy, but this was actually a top tier drama that was riding on top of a sort of ridiculous concept, but the ridiculous concept only existed because the overall message.

This movie was a solid 8 or 9/10 for me, if only because it completely caught me off guard.",om7s20
h5rvpig,[deleted],om7s20
h5khvm4,Cage is such a good actor and I hate that so people try to make him a meme. Another outstanding performance in a very good movie.,om7s20
h5o2fba,"I might be alone in this, but I had to Google what truffles are during the movie. I'm from Mexico so maybe truffles aren't common here, in the beginning I thought Wolff was buying drugs from Cage, until I realize pigs are used to find this delicacy or whatever.

This character reminds a bit of Francis Mallmann, he is a famous Michelin star Argentine chef that lives in a very secluded place in the Patagonia, near Antartica. He is a sort of guru, so good that people travel to his cabin to learn from him.",om7s20
h5vmnp1,"This film feels like it came out of nowhere. My girlfriend and I just left the theater dumbfounded. What an unexpectedly beautiful movie, and the ruminations on love/loss were done in a really touching way. 

Not only was the acting very strong, there are so many standout scenes in this movie that I haven't been able to stop thinking about. The underground fighting ring, the conversation with the chef at Feldman's, Rob visiting his old house, and that incredible dinner scene as the climax... The movie felt like it was going to be predictable, then completely ran the other way. Easily the best movie of the year for me. Hoping Nic Cage and even Alex Wolff get some solid recognition for their roles in the film.",om7s20
h6k6h6h,"What a movie.

I love how the Persimmon Tree kinda parallels with the Pig. When Rob said at the diner that he should never came looking for his Pig, in his head, his pig will still alive. Same to the Persimmon tree, he thinks that it is still there because that's what he thinks until he went back to his old house and discover that it doesn't there anymore. 

The entire film reminds me of Barbra Streisand's song, The Way We Where. ""Memories, may be beautiful and yet what's too painful to remember.""",om7s20

h5klekl,Wow. Was not expecting that film or that good of a film.,om7s20
h5nu7oa,"i’d love to hear takes from anyone active in the high-end urban restaurant scene. one of my serious exes was a sous chef at a prestigious spot in our city while we were dating and has subsequently left the business because it destroyed his mental health (and our relationship). both of my parents were in the industry through their 30’s. i worked FOH at a Beard-winning spot for a few months while i was in college. this movie punched me in the gut for a lot of reasons, but the looming impact of the industry really elevated it for me. the appeal for non-industry folks is obvious, but i’m curious to hear from others about their experience seeing this.",om7s20
h621n0a,"Spoilers:

Wow. I fucking loved everything about this film.

I was amazed at the way the film built tension by establishing a violent tone early. It ratchets the tension of everything which comes after. Yet throughout the film Robin never throws a single punch at a human being, he just takes them. So many of them, from all sides. It’s been a while since I’ve seen a character who I felt so strongly for. Nic Cage’s best performance ever IMO. I love the choice to leave Lori’s tragedy felt rather than said. We all knew what the pig meant without needing to be told.

“I remember every meal I ever cooked. I remember every person I ever served.” What a fucking line.

I feel like this was the movie “You Were Never Really Here” wanted to be lol. NEON is quickly becoming one of my favorite indie film outlets.",om7s20
h5je07j,really good movie,om7s20
h5lijbp,"I fell into the trap of expecting something specific going into this.

What I got was so much better than that ever could have been.",om7s20
h5jmyn6,"One of the better films that I have seen during this summer (if we are talking about newer releases). Pig asks the audience about forgiveness and lost and how we can deal with them, and Michael Sarnoski executed these themes in a meaningful way. Great debut for Sarnoski and a great return for Nicholas Cage.",om7s20
h5jxa0q,"Wow. Hit from the left field hard by this. What a beautiful little quiet film. I thought of Nic Cage as a bit of a joke actor the last few years but he’s legitimately great in this, reminding you that he’s a fantastic actor when he wants to be. 
I got the impression that on paper this was going to be a bit wackier than it turned out, Cage playing it straighter than intended by the casting. And it turned out so much better for it. It’s at its heart a snapshot of grief at its greatest without being bogged down by the misery itself. Great, great film.",om7s20
h61k0ga,"I’m saddened by the way this film was portrayed in the trailer, like it wasn’t exactly misleading, but I’m afraid a lot of people are going to go into this expecting John Wick with Nicolas Cage. 

This was easily the best film I’ve seen in 2021, I wasn’t exactly sure what to expect from it, but man was every single thing about this movie on point. As an aspiring filmmaker, I’m truly jealous Michael Sarnoski came out of the gate with the knockout, I hope to one day debut with a film even half as good as this.",om7s20
h6hu1yf,"Watched it last night with a group of friends. Was the first time back at a theatre in a year. Smoked a joint in the parking lot, and went in with moderate expectations. Didn’t expect to finish the film sobbing, my make up running down my face. Lost my dad in June 2020 to cancer, his middle name was Roblyn. I kept seeing similarities in him and Robin. I wasn’t expecting this film to explore grief, and in such a powerful way. Crying as I write this even now. Ending song was gorgeous too.
Gonna see it again on Tuesday!",om7s20
h5juu16,"Adam Arkin comes in with a temperature changing performance. Great movie.

As a Portlander, I appreciate that this was clearly filmed in Portland and wasn't shot in Vancouver BC. It shows.

h5px2xn,"Ugggggggh totally crushed me. I was very careful not to learn too much about the film other than the deep brooding marketing that kept popping up in my web browsing. I never even watched the trailer. I'm so happy because I really got the untainted experience.

What a rare film that takes all expectations and flips them on their heads though. It very deliberately tugs you along with great steady tension and looming dread (mimicking Cage's very purposeful shuffle) only to have this marvelous awakening as it all comes into focus. Beautiful, dreadful, grief stricken, and just wonderful. A near perfect anti-John Wick film.

I love that Cage keeps finding these offbeat projects. They're perfect for him and so refreshing.",om7s20
h5yte7a,"That ending was something else, no words spoken yet you feel the emotion. Camera glances at the empty bed for the pig, then when the song starts playing it really hits you.",om7s20
h628rgi,"Just so everyone knows: even with the largest earthquake and tsunami, it will never reach Portland lol. Too far inland with mountains that are thousands of feet tall. The tidal wave wouldn't get past Tillamook forest. We are due for a big earthquake soon though, he was right about that. But also the bridges in Portland should take it fine, and they've even already made adjustments to some of the bridges to accommodate for the earthquake. 

And finally, yes, Mt. Hood is an active volcano and we will probably see it erupt in our lifetime. But don't worry, those pyroclastic flows and lahars aren't going to reach Portland. The worst Portland would experience is smoke and ash from the fires. 

I'm also really fun at parties. Great movie though! Nic Cage killed it. 7/10",om7s20
h5jhhzo,"Thought it was fantastic. Nicolas Cage continues to be one of the most fascinating actors of his generation (it's a shame he's been reduced to 'Le Wacky One True Hecking God XD!!!' amongst a small portion of film fans), and will surely be in contention for all sorts of awards. Alex Wolff was fantastic as well, and I can't believe this was a debut feature for Sarnoski. He's going to go on to do big things. 

Genuinely interested as to what the general audience reaction to this will be. Think lots of people will go in expecting John Wick w/ a pig and Nicolas Cage, and will be faced with a tremendous meditation on love and grief.",om7s20

I saw this without having seen a trailer; all I knew is that Nicolas Cage wants his pig back and the reviews were overwhelmingly positive. I had to let it sit for awhile because while I really enjoyed it, I wasn’t sure how much I liked it.

I think this movie fuckin’ rocks! It’s such a unique take on the revenge movie, but instead of violence, it resorts to cooking to resolve the issues. When you think it’s going in one direction, it goes the opposite way. When you think Nic Cage is gonna rip someone’s throat out and shit down their neck, he pierces their soul through monologue. I haven’t been keeping up with any recent releases, but I’m glad I went out and saw this one because it was a genuine surprise.",om7s20

Here's how I would have ended it.

There ya go, happy ending.",om7s20
h5j7m3d,"We just finished it a few hours ago. Husband was disappointed a bit because he said the trailer hyped it. I felt it showed what it needed and I felt they were able to tell a part of Robin's story. I was trying to explain to him that some movies tend to leave details from the conversation in passing and that open-ended stories work in certain movies. His main gripe was that he felt it's still just 3/4 of a story and wanted to know what happened after that. I honestly enjoyed it, and explained to him part of their theme was getting over their loss.",om7s20
h5oqob8,"I loved how you learned about Rob’s past with his interactions with others.  Like the head chef’s reaction upon recognizing him shows that Rob was a god tier chef back in the day.  Rob’s monologue that broke the chef completely down provided some exposition about why he left it all behind.  

I also really dug the scene with the baker, Jezebel.   The long camera shot kind of reflected the dynamic between a chef and baker… distanced, but respectful of each other’s skill.  I also laughed when he grabbed two armfuls of her goods on the way out, knowing he probably wasn’t going to see her again.  It loosely reminded me of a part in Bourdain’s Kitchen Confidential where he describes how much slack he cut his enigmatic baker because of how good his bread was.",om7s20
h5y4abi,"Finally, a movie about the infamous, dangerous and elusive underground Oregon. . . truffle farming? 

Starts out very John Wick and thought it was going to go a different angle, but ends up being a love letter to food and a deconstruction of grief.

Cage looks badass as fuck and you think he's going to go full Mandy and just start beating the shit out of people looking for his damn pig (cute pig by the way), but the movie goes a completely different angle. 

Speaking of Cage he is great, while subdued, it's a v good performance and I hope he gets at least a little recognition. Though I would say all the character's he's played in the last few years have sort of a similar vibe to them, and aesthetic. This is though, definitely his most 'tender' role I've seen him play in a long time. I don't think the kid from Hereditary was as good, just thought he was serviceable. 

I think it's cool that the movie doesn't really properly set up it's back story and we're left to kind of fill in the pieces a bit—not everything is laid out for you. The movie sets a pace and stays it throughout and I respect that for sure, but i think I just expected to be blown away and I was more just left with the thought 'hm that was nice'. 

I really liked the Chef scene in the restaurant, definitely a highlight of the movie for me. It also had some good funny moments that were unexpected. Cage had some great one liners. 

I love Portland and want to go back. I kept thinking watching it 'I've been there!'

Overall I enjoyed it, but the character and world building was pretty lacking and the tone couldn't really settle itself one way or another. The movie tries to sell you that the villain of the movie is a dangerous mobster who has half the city in his pocket...and then they walk into his house and cook him dinner in his kitchen.

The underground chef fight club, and all the other stops on his hunt just didn't feel satisfying. The movie was Nick Cage calmly asking people where his pig was for 90 minutes. That would've been fine if the side characters didn't feel like cardboard cutouts. 

Overall I'd give it a 7/10. It was enjoyable, but a bit sloppy.",om7s20

h5m2kpd,I really wish they would have ended this movie stronger. It actually peaked the restaurant. That was the most powerful moment in the movie when you realize Robin wasn't just some genius chef that ran away but he remembered everything and cared about all the people he left but couldn't face them after he lost his wife. He was isolated in his own prison. That was such a deep layer underneath the moment the chef had regretting not opening the pub. The ending fell flatter then that. They didn't need to kill off the pig but could have expanded on the father's regrets with his life and kept that theme going.

h5ky9bh,"I thought this movie was incredibly trite. I went into this blind and thought I was ready for anything but nothing ever happened. Robin’s past was really cliche, what did the underground fight scene that wasnt even a fight add to anything? Seemed like it was trying too hard to be cool but it was tonally random. Didn’t care at all about the kid’s sob story either. I thought the dialogue through the whole movie was very stilted.

The best part was when they met the woman at the truffle stand and how she leapt up to help Robin. Movie would have been much more interesting exploring that community rather than pretending to be a pseudo crime/drama movie. 

I like slow, deliberate, thoughtful movies but this didn’t seem to have anything behind it. The biggest crime was how painfully dull the characters were.

h65oo33,"I really loved this movie even though I was also expecting some ""fantastical revenge fantasy movie"".  

I want to give kudos to Michael Sarnoski, the man in his first film told a very deep existential story with a unique set-up within 90 mins without a trim of fat there especially how he paces the revealing the layers of  who ""Rob"" really is, his grief and suffering and why he chose to disappear for the last 15 years despite his acclaim and status and gave me a satisfying ending that was true to the characters and the story.  

I really hope/want Nicolas Cage to be up for an Oscar for this. When it's not about the check, the man is a great actor like Adaptation and Leaving Las Vegas showed. I also hope instead of jumping for more Hollywood opps in a comeback, he stick to doing intimate, dramas like this.  

Supporting cast was great including Arkin and Wolff including both of them hiding their own grief and pain and I did love that scene with Robin and the Chef. I felt that also showed the extremes Rob could have went had he stayed in Portland after his wife died whether being angry, bitter drugged up in those ""Restaurant Worker Fight Clubs"" or ""Sold Out"" his dreams like Finway did instead of doing what he loved and was passionate about.

h863b73,"I just watched this last night and sat silently through the credits before I got up. This morning, I keep thinking back on the scene in the bakery. I loved the whole “I’m a baker,” business. But what I keep dwelling on is when he remarks about the curtains, looks over his shoulder and says, “It’s better this way.” 

That to me really sums up a lot of what the movie is, at least for Robin. He’s so profoundly depressed and pitifully nihilistic. Being back in town is one reminder after another of a life and a love he once had (his wife, his food, his community, his house, his restaurant) that has so long been gone from him. Being back only serves to remind him of the pain and meaninglessness of it all. So when he remarks that it’s better this way I feel like he saying its better that I’m gone. Things are better without me. 

But more importantly, being alone, filthy, without responsibility - it’s better for him. No constant reminders, no disappointment…it’s just better for him considering all he’s lost. A blanketed reassurance to someone who obviously cares about him and his work (she’s the only character to embrace him) just to let her know that despite appearances (or perhaps, contextually vis a vis the curtains, due to appearances) things are better.",om7s20

A beautiful supplement in Panos universe together with Johann Johannsson's eerie soundtrack:  


That being said I did not really like this movie that much, it was an okay movie. Maybe it was because I had high expectations, but I have to disagree with a few of the comments here that it was 2021s best movie. Some on the script seemed emotionless, blank, and without any depth. Some other parts had a lot of it. The acting and characters were not interesting enough, and they did not manage to level/save the bleak plot and in my opinion, made most of the movie a weird mix of a shallow Hollywood and A24ish movie. Some parts were great, don't get me wrong. Some were full of emotions, but I don't necessarily think they justify the rest of the movie as 2021's best movie as many of you write.

h6ybso7,"'Nicolas Cage searches for his kidnapped pig' is exactly the sort of absurd premise one would expect from the latest Nicolas Cage movie. But the bluntly titled Pig isn't just another 'look at me I'm weird and Cage is weird too' type of movie like Mandy or Willy's Wonderland. It's actually surprisingly profound and Cage gives a restrained, pensive and fairly noteworthy performance like we haven't seen in years. Although the plot sounds absurd, it's treated seriously and the film seems to respect its characters and not poke fun at anything (perhaps with the exception of haute cuisine and trendy restaurants). The characters are really good and one gradually learns more about them as the plot moves along, adding a layer of depth and emotion. There are a few weird elements to Pig, though, like the idea that Portland's restaurant scene has its own fight club for cooks and servers. And the first act walks a bit too close to schlock, almost but not entirely falling towards what everyone expected the film to be in the first place.",om7s20

1. How exactly did the ""fight club"" scene work in Robin's favor? I was unclear on exactly how it worked with a bunch of guys laying down money, and him just being punched, and then demanding the pig or the money. Was the guy running the fights going to lose a bunch of money or something? Were people paying just to beat on Robin, or were they placing bets...?

2. From that, it seems really odd that Robin gets the name of the restaurant, which the kid *knows* is supplied by his father, but somehow the kid doesn't realize his dad would then be the one who took the pig. If his dad is the restaurant supplier, who else would have the pig? It seems like there wasn't really a need to shake down the chef for information.",om7s20

Is the money laid in the floor money people are willing to pay to see Robin take a beating, or is that their bid for the chance to administer it?

It might be the farthest deviation of my genre expectations vs. reality ever, like - I had no idea that the movie was going to be a serious drama with little to no comedic value or action scenes. 

That said, thought it was great, despite having some confusing script decisions throughout all 3 acts....what was the deal with the underground fighting ring, and why did have about 3min of relevance? It was such a random and interesting addition to the lore, but was totally discarded without any exploration or reason. 

Also - the name of the 3rd act kind of spoilers most of it...as much as I didn't see the Pig being dead already, it was very clear from mid-Act 2 and beginning of Act 3 that ""rob"" was going to use his culinary skills to get inside the  head of the big bad.

It bored me so much I lost all sympathy and feelings toward any character. I wasn't expecting a revenge plot but holy shit that felt like a massive waste of time to sit through.

hhqh7la,"So I have a different theory about the ending and would love a second opinion.
Let me preface this by saying, I am an English teacher and may be over analysing here. 

Earlier in the film, Amir tells Robin his mother killed herself. Later we discovered that in fact she attempted but was not entirely successful and his father is keeping her alive artificially against Amir's wishes. He also says something to the effect of: 'there is not much you can do to help people like that, they are going to kill themselves anyway'. I interpreted all this to mean, Amir feels that people who are in pain and attempt suicide should be allowed to end their own suffering and any attempts to stop them will only prolong their suffering. 

Now to the ending. When Rob decides to walk, and they part saying ""see you Thursday"", this felt more like a final goodbye to me. Rob had accepted that his wife is gone, his pig is gone, and now there is nothing left for him, not in the city not in the forest. When asked if he is alright he says ""yeah"", but again this felt like it had a different meaning. Not a ""yeah I'll be alright, I'll gone home and make some dinner and tomorrow is a new day"" kind of vibe, more of a ""yeah, I have nothing left, I can accept that now and it's time for me to move on (end my life)"" type vibe. 

He walks off into the darkness and Amir gets in his car and starts crying. I thought this was because Amir knows Rob is going to kill himself, but chooses not to make the same mistake as his father and prolong his friends suffering for his own comfort. 

We them see Rob returning to his cabin, where he sits on the bed and looks long and hard at the towel hanging on the rack, then up at the ceiling. I don't know if it is actually possible to hang yourself with a towel, but it felt to me like this is what Rob was contemplating in the final scene. 

So long story short, I think Rob killed himself to be at peace after accepting he has nothing left to live for. And, I think allowing Rob to leave, despite knowing he was going end his life, gave Amir the chance to correct the mistake of his father and ultimately find peace himself. 

Curious to know if anyone had a similar interpretation.",om7s20
hkp74yb,"Alex Wolff killed it. Those reaction shots.

A couple too many similar ones by the end, but I could understand the director's temptation to use all of them.

Also, no movie in recent memory made me appreciate kindness more than this film. Seeing Amir and Rob be a little nicer to each other by the end was so endearing. 

The movie overall had such good control of its  emotions. When Rob starts to cook and that warm song plays in the back, I got really emotional. Same when Rob got that hug from the baker.",om7s20

hu2hw3m,"I liked the movie, but I don’t think it’s particularly good. My problem with it is that so much is left unexplored/unexplained and it doesn’t seem like the Pig’s death changed anything?  
  
First of all, they go into that underground club where nothing is explained and it was never touched upon again. Didn’t quite see what the point was, and why people were so eager to hit him when Edgar told him he had no value there.  
  
And then with the main story, I’d expect Rob to change while looking for the piggo and for that to lead into a message at the end, or for him to change his life in some way. But at the end they just all go back to how things were before it seems. Rob goes back to the hut. The kid sheds a tear and sleeps in his car for some reason. His dad still won’t let his wife die.

>!When I watched the scene you can almost pin point the exact moment when his soul dies, a fast brow furrow and tear shrink wrapped eyes ready to explode. !<

>!There was some dancing around, of course, by Chef Finlay trying to avoid the subject of pursuing his dream.!<  
>!One moment in particular was cruelly hilarious because we all do it when exposed to our own lies we tell ourselves everyday was when Chef Feld says, ""Derek... what was it that you always talked about opening. Wasn't it a pub?"" Chef Finlay fumbles for his words and limply repeats, ""Everyone loves it here.This... this is a... a... huge success."" haha. So funny because of his wishy washy response with his ego fighting to survive under the onslaught of Chef Feld's inquisition. !<

One point that is appropriate to mention here is that silence in the presence of eating guests is the greatest compliment a chef can ever receive. This means that people are far to busy eating, thoroughly enjoying and fully enraptured with your cooked food to even talk to the other seated guests.

>!Everyone around the central table with Chef Finlay, Chef Feld and Amir are all talking away with no one really engrossed in eating the dish made by Chef Finlay. Also no one leans into table of Chef Feld, Amir to offer praise to Chef Finlay nor does anyone stop Chef Finlay when he walks up to Chef Feld, Amir's table. No one knows or cares about Chef Finlay.!<

>!Then Chef Feld devastatingly inquires, ""Why didn't you open your pub?"" which leaves Chef Finlay totally stripped bare. Chef Finlay cannot form sentences and has even lost his voice with a babbling, ""I... I...  dunno if I even wanted a pub."" That exact moment you can see and hear his heart rip asunder and the pain of abandoning his dream gushes out.!<

>! Chef Feld then continues his interrogation. ""You said you had a few rooms upstairs... a real English pub."" More feeble arguments by Chef Finlay's ego claiming ""no one wants pubs... it's a bad investment"" just shows the extent we all go to trying to cover up the lies we tell ourselves.!<

>! Chef Feld: ""What was going to be your signature dish?"" Chef Finlay: ""Liver scotch eggs on a Honey Cream Mustard."" In my opinion I felt the actor failed a bit to deliver a truly authentic response. It was acted well but still to me it seemed a bit canned and to quickly delivered by the actor. I felt at that moment he was just reading a script line but then the actor quickly recovered with his ""insanity laugh"". Still well done though.!<

>!Chef Feld then fires the coup de grace. Chef Feld goes on to to say words heavy with pursuing passion, presenting a genuine article of your craft wielded by the gifts God has bestowed upon you, and in life you only have a handful of True Loves that are forever yours. Nicolas Cage really does a breathtaking outstanding job here. His eyebrow flicker at ""...because you haven't .... Shown Them."" really hammers the truth of a Chef making a ""piece de resistance"" that astounds guests versus just frying up a platter of ""shit on a shingle""!<

>!With those words of exposing Chef Finlay as a fraud who has abandoned his lifes dream of opening a pub the camera focuses onto Chef Finlay. The eyebrow tweaks, the forced grin, the desperate laugh, the years sunken eyes devoid of passion, the dry throat panting, the grasping ears holding every word of Chef Feld all culminates to Chef Finlay greedily guzzling a goblet of wine. The first drink his soul has had in years. !<",om7s20

h6fqef4,"> What was up with the fighting pit? Some place where we people pay money to hit people and watch people get hit? How did that tie in to Robyn's backstory? I didn't really hear the few lines he talked about it. I'm confused cause he was obviously known for being an amazing chef. I just got lost in how taking hits for money tied into all of that, and it really only played in for the first 1/3 of the movie.

These are fight clubs where the food industry workers can pay some vagrant to let them beat them up to lay off some steam. The food industry is notoriously stressful, so the idea of having an underground hobo fight pit tht specifically caters to them doesn't sound so crazy. Hobos getting paid to be beaten up isn't new to film neither: there are scenes in *Mr. Robot* where Tyrell Wellick pays a hobo to let him beat him up after he has a rough day at the office.

Robin would have known about them because he was part of the industry. And, as Lauren's tape reveals, it sounds as though as back in the day he would go to restaurants and harshly criticize and complain about the food and service. Naturally, people who worked in those places would have an axe to grind with him due to his past treatment of them, so they'd pay a premium to beat *him* up instead of just another vagrant.

He's not allowed to trade on the name. But demigod Robin Feld allows him to use his name and that means so much to him.,om7s20

Rob is done, and ready to leave, and that's OK",om7s20
hrf0gry,Well said. Just watched. I was expecting Robin to cast more blame on Amir without the context of why Amir told his dad about the pig but I’m glad he didn’t.

hqtbb5b,"I think it's reminiscing what's not there anymore. To the child, there wasn't a persimmon tree. To Rob, there used to be, and he remembers everything -- where it standed, what it looked like, how the fruit tasted. Similar to reminiscing his wife, and >!eventually, the pig.!<",om7s20

h5l0y7a,"Great to see Alex Wolff in a more serious role, seems like his career is really taking off.",om7s20
h5s60mp,"Wolff and Cage cemented acting nominations in my book. Wolff tries hard to be a douchebag Suave business guy but is constantly under his dads shadow. He really drove this film home. Without him, it would’ve been a Cage show, and while I wouldn’t have minded that, the movie wouldn’t have had the same emotional impact that it did",om7s20
h5kdabz,"This film cemented for me that he’s a great actor with range. Prior, I had only seen him in dark, brooding roles. There’s still some overlap here, but there was enough contrast that prompted me to doubt if I was watching a different actor.",om7s20

h6ix9an,"Can’t understate how important his character and performance was to conveying the ‘legend’ and awe that Cage’s character is supposed to inspire throughout. Everytime another character realised who Cage was, they cut to Alex Wolff and he was practically on the verge of tears the whole time. It really added a lot of emotion and weight.",om7s20

> Without moving your hands, curl your right knuckles up, so that they point toward the ceiling. Under pressure from Juan de Fuca, the stuck edge of North America is bulging upward and compressing eastward, at the rate of, respectively, three to four millimetres and thirty to forty millimetres a year. It can do so for quite some time, because, as continent stuff goes, it is young, made of rock that is still relatively elastic. (Rocks, like us, get stiffer as they age.) But it cannot do so indefinitely. There is a backstop—the craton, that ancient unbudgeable mass at the center of the continent—and, sooner or later, North America will rebound like a spring. If, on that occasion, only the southern part of the Cascadia subduction zone gives way—your first two fingers, say—the magnitude of the resulting quake will be somewhere between 8.0 and 8.6. That’s the big one. If the entire zone gives way at once, an event that seismologists call a full-margin rupture, the magnitude will be somewhere between 8.7 and 9.2. That’s the very big one.

hey29li,This is really late but I was just as bothered by him not taking care of the wounds at first until I realized they represented grief. Those pains don't go away and you can't just clean them up and he only deals with them at the end once he accepts his pig is gone.,om7s20
htjf3o8,"For me, I thought it was because of many reasons. One, he didn't want to waste any second treating himself when he could be using that time to look for his pig. Two, he didn't want to take care of himself when his pig is out there, maybe suffering (didn't seem right to Rob). Three, he doesn't care what happens to him, or he doesn't care how others might view him. Four, his wounds show others what he's going through right now. He's heartbroken that his pig was kidnapped and might even be dead, and if he cleaned himself up, people won't think that he's going through something. Lastly, he didn't want to convince himself to move on. If he physically felt and looked like he was okay, he might slowly think to give up.",om7s20
h5jrexk,"I have to wonder if that was the intention of the movie. Just like the Portland chefs deconstruct dishes ""to make the familiar alien"", the movie takes the premise from a dumb action film and elevates it into a thoughtful art house film. Kinda clever.",om7s20

h5uqarz,"Yeah. I came on here wondering if anyone else felt the fight club was completely out of tune with the rest of the film. It added nothing of value as far as I'm aware and just confuses the theme of the film. Makes the film seem a lot more fake than it needed to be. It absolutely shouldn't have been in the film.

Could've been an imdb 8 but now it's a fair 7 because of those ""edgar"" scenes. That said, if someone can conjure up a reason for the scenes that isn't just convoluted bullshit, I could revise my opinion.",om7s20

Then, when Robin writes his full name on the ""next up"" board and an audience made up of restaurant industry folks starts throwing down cash to bet (presumably) on Robin to last the full time, that proves that he is quite well remembered and regarded.

This is why he's handed the paper with info he wants at the end of the scene.",om7s20

I thought there was going to be a little more focus on his cooking and food in general, but I think a lot of the greatness of this film was leaving the right things unsaid and just indirectly referenced, so I’m fine with that. the scene where he goes back to his old restaurant and speaks with his former baker was one of my favorite scenes, and I think the depth of that part could be lost on non-industry viewers. my wife is also in the biz, coincidentally a pastry chef, and she started crying when the baker said “thank you, chef” to robin, and I don’t think the power of that line could be fully understood without some time in the industry. the film also did a really great job of showing, through the various interactions with the industry characters, how robin was simultaneously loved, respected, envied, loathed, and even idolized by his peers. it’s probably going to end up one of my favorite films.",om7s20

h7xqav0,"Unfortunately I agree. I wanted to like the film, and I love Cage. But the movie doesn’t end off all that different. Sure he’s acknowledged his loss, but by the lesson of the movie itself. That doesn’t change anything. Everything that is lost is still lost.

All the random long shots of people staring at stuff, the incredibly wonky audio mixing making some lines indecipherable. Then beyond that, I just didn’t care for Amir. Some young, dumb coward who from the first scene was obviously going to be the cause of the pig getting stolen. Who’s cliche scared/worshipping of his workaholic dad is many generations old now. I just wish there was more revolution. Robin really growing or doing something dramatic, Amir moving away from his father. 

Instead what happens in real life happens here. Stuff is lost, everyone just kinda putters on. Which while realistic is just not what I watch movies to see. I live in that world every day of the week.",om7s20

To me, this is a 30 minute movie about grief, loss and processing trauma, but stretched out into 90 minutes by adding in truly one dimensional characters for Cage to exposit on. The movie relies on the notion that he's a revered person in the old restaurant scene, but virtually nobody in the movie has any real connection to him(except a brief scene at the bakery). Yeah, he dropped off the grid, but that doesn't mean everyone has to be such an adversarial prick with a comically drawn out trail of clues to solve the case. Even the secondary protagonist's relationship with him seems tacked on.   


There's three scenes that should be comic relief-but only the first(with the other truffle hunter) actually works, because it's the payoff after the pignapping scene. The other two (the service industry fight club and the takedown of his former employee) fail because there's no leading tension into those scenes. Instead, you just have a series of scenes that lead the story along with all the subtlety and artistry of an arrow drawn on the floor.",om7s20

I saw the movie a few months ago so my memory might be off, but I remember him finishing that rant along the lines of looking up (at the giant waves about to make impact) and and realizing you’re about to die. 

I didn’t believe he was going to kill himself until he looked up during that final scene. I cried because it brought me back to that rant about the mega earthquake. In my interpretation I realized the reason he was looking up was realizing he really know nothing to look forward to anymore.. except for the end of it all.

Your mind can immediately link back to Eurydice's food-as-art facade, the waitresses performance (like she's on stage) of presenting the 'deconstructed' scallops, and the chef's expansion on that performance by using flashy lingo to elevate his menu.

Daniel Radcliffe is notorious for the same. My take is, you’re not always going to get it right but when you do it’s a masterpiece like no other as displayed here. It really gives big blockbusters a run for their money too and shows you you’re being bought out for cheap thrills. I doubt they’ll appreciate this 92 minute film having more acting skills, depth, (the list goes on for more than 92 minutes ironically) then the majority of the huge blockbuster films that have come out in the past decade. For that alone I can see Nicholas Cage being “overlooked” for an award. I do recall recently watching a “Nomadland” and Indie film alike however was grossly horrible from start to end, but won the most prestigious awards. really goes to show whoever hands out these things really have their heads up their asses.

With Cage’s character that wouldn’t make sense however - everything he said had some sort of purpose and deeper meaning. This makes a lot of sense, thank you.

I on the other hand have one question (watched the movie tonight), and instead of getting buried in the comments I’ll just ask here - Amir’s mother was not dead, but in hospital (presumably some sort of mental institution), right? But instead of explaining all this to Robin, he takes the “easy route” of telling him she killed herself? It wasn’t talked about at all, was waiting for at least a comment about it in the dinner scene. But I suppose it’s open to interpretation - maybe Amir and his dad feel like they’ve lost her because of mental illness or dementia or something, and don’t want to talk about it because of trauma.",om7s20

im not completely sure but I think it's supposed to represent how cutthroat the restaurant business is, and doing it this way allows the audience to experience it in a visually striking way rather than in some sort of conversation. It serves as an outlet people use to deal with emotion, stress, and pain. Restaurant industry people, chefs especially, have high rates of addiction and risky behavior due to job stress. The scene is essentially supposed to show how Cage has nothing left to lose and only cares about getting his pig back. Edgar accused him of becoming a nobody because he left the industry (a sign of weakness) but he gains Edgar's respect again and proves to everyone that he’s not weak

hope that helps",om7s20

h6g87ya,"Chiming in a week late but I just wanted to say I think you are absolutely correct. I’m surprised so many people weren’t so hot on this aspect of the movie. 

My favorite part of this movie was how well it’s set up to seem like a John Wick revenge-porn movie up until this point. Like once Nic Cage shows up in this fight club style basement explaining the underbelly of the restaurant industry, it really seems like it’s going to go down a very cliche “guy with dangerous past comes back to take revenge” path. I think this twist is what makes the movie so incredible. It’s a beautiful piece that shows how stupid the idea of revenge is and how important it is to really care about the people/animals in your life. Not to knock too hard on Joh Wick, cause it is a fun movie, but our media is saturated with blood soaked revenge stories. It takes real bravery to confront someone who has hurt you with genuine kindness instead.",om7s20
h7r8b8h,"I think the problem most people had -- at least the one *I* had -- is that the scene just felt out of place. Even granting the whole 'it's there to subvert revenge-film expectations' explanation that's a bit too meta of a scene to include in an otherwise pretty grounded film. Maybe it works on this 'commentary on revenge films' level, but on a plot and character level it really takes you out of the story because it doesn't fit in with the universe of the rest of the film. The rest of the movie doesn't seem that concerned with this kind of meta-commentary at the sake of plot and realism -- it's a pretty well done, grounded and realistic portrayal of loss and grief. Even if it does have its quirks, the story never quite breaks with reality other than in the fight club scene.

The whole thing revolving around a family dispute was completely lame. He stole the pig just to sabotage his own son? That is so boring. I would have preferred if the antagonist was somebody who actually would go through the trouble to stealing a truffle pig. Someone who'd I imagine would be pretty desperate. Not the freaking Don of restaurant crime. That's just ludicrous. 

I felt the payoff was completely undeserved as well. One of their happiest memories was this particularly tasty dinner? I find that very unconvincing.

Speaking personally, one of my most cherished and meaningful memories I share with my wife is of a meal we had together in Spain. I've also once seen my mother start weeping after tasting a dish from a recipe card of my grandmother's that she had found.

Food is very much intrinsically tied to people's memories, to places, and to their emotional attachments to others. It's not that strange.

>Obviously this movie is about Robin getting over his wife's death, but I just think that it's such a cheap way to build sympathy with the audience.

h62zws3,"Many don't realize how similar pigs are to dogs, and many who do bury that knowledge for the sake of their tastebuds.",om7s20
h6gvban,"I gave up meat four years ago (only eat a bit of fish now) and this is what I always tell people who act shocked and say they could never give up bacon. Pigs are incredibly smart, loyal and familial creatures. They have just as much personality as dogs - if not more so than many breeds, tbh - and are not the dirty, dumb swine they are often portrayed as. If you ever hear the cries a mother pig makes when her piglets are taken from her, it's horrifying. They will mope and refuse to eat when their young ones are taken away. 

I get that animals kill one another and it's the circle of life and I'm not some wacky vegan who feeds my cat plant based meals, or tries to throw blood on people's fur coats. I'm pretty realistic and non judgmental about it. I realize this is, to an extent, the way the world spins. But I want no part of factory farming and personally, I also just have no desire to eat those animals anymore. Humans have evolved to show sympathy and empathy and not engage in animalistic behavior. We aren't raping and murdering other humans anymore either, because we understand the cruelty of these actions; so the idea that ""people have killed animals for thousands of years"" or whatever is kind of a moot point in my mind, because by the same logic you could try to defend other acts humans used to engage in.

People act absolutely OUTRAGED when dogs or cats are abused or hurt (rightfully so! It horrifies me too) and yet so many of these people will bury their head in the sand to justify eating that bacon strip. (Which, by the way, really only tastes good because of the insane amounts of salt and seasoning they put on it. If you've ever had bacon cooked in nothing but its own fat, it really doesn't have the signature flavor. Most meats without seasoning aren't really that flavorful - that's why we sell rubs and dips and glazes and everything else, and why you can put the same seasoning on seitan for example and pretty much have it taste exactly the same.)",om7s20

hefpnek,"Actually, the pig doesn’t necessarily die in the movie.  The very beginning of chapter two opens wide on the sun streaming through the woods and the pig walking by itself.  Then it cuts to French toast breakfast in the apartment.  I guess you might interpret it as the dream Nicolas Cage is having before he wakes to breakfast…or it could be that the pig is alive wandering the woods.  The end of the movie in the diner parking lot Nicolas Cage looks off in the distance as if he senses something (the pig being alive?) and decides to walk home.  The pig is not shown with Nicolas Cage back in the cabin but the music is lovely and upbeat and you half expect the pig to enter the scene.",om7s20

I mean crying very hard. I literally felt awful and depressed. I am incredibly close to one of my cats. I’m not a mother and not sure if I’ll ever have a kid yet, but this one cat brings out all the mother instincts. I’ve never loved anything as much as this cat. 

Knowing how he feels about his pig I could relate and it literally broke me. The end broke me. Emotionally I was too upset to critique this film from a more rational standpoint. Plus movies are subjective.

h62zwmk,"It parallels the story of Orpheus and Eurydice which this is based on, or at least draws heavy inspiration from. In addition, losing and grieving for the pig allowed him to finally come to peace with the passing of his wife. Or at least, that's my take from the ending.",om7s20
h6gvp2y,"The entire film was about coping with loss, so I think reuniting him with the pig would have undermined that somewhat. Losing the pig was necessary for him to finally come to terms with his wife's passing. It's more of a figurative arc than a literal one - in my mind the entire film had a somewhat fairytale/surrealistic vibe to it, as much of the dialogue and the way scenes played out didn't mirror natural behavior. It actually reminded me of a Don DeLillo novel in that sense.",om7s20
h6z6tt4,"Late but I want to say I agree with this. The double loss felt forced and I was really hoping that the pig had just escaped and Evil Dad didn't want to admit it and he would find her on the walk home. The movie created redemption for no one, just made them face their pain, and Nick already had enough pain imo and did enough confrontation. Give him his pig back.",om7s20
id5cs71,"He mentions that not having searched he would assume his pig to be alive and that would have been a false truth so at the end of the day instead of living with the lie and ignorantly moving forward wirh flase hope he is happier knowing the truth so that he can mourn/grieve and move past the loss much more healthily. 
Amir cant even be in the same room with his mom as he has already awknowledged her death while his father has not awknowledged his wife's death and keeps her alive though presumingly braindead or something of the sort he runs from grief. Robin plays the tape in full as accepting his pigs death and learning he cannot run away from life with its good and bad moments he has felt strong enough to listen to his wife sing and treasure her voice and come to a peace in that as he accepts her loss/death. Just as the chef needs to mourn the loss of his dream pub. .. thats all im writing for now",om7s20

This menace that he says it with is pure self loathing transmuted on the inside into a ""stay back"" snarl wrapped around a lie. That guy hates himself so much he built a castle around the hate and told himself a story that it was strength just to cope with that pain. And then someone who gave him one of the best experiences he ever had in his life, who bared his soul to him with his craft that he had mastered, did it again after he went through the exact same grief he had been through. And he remembered. And he understood what he had done. And he felt deep, deep shame and grief for it.

And some things you just can't take back. Why was every date night punctuated with fights and drama? What made that guy who he was? What hardened him? He cared too once upon a time, and he let it fade and slip away and told himself a story to make that okay. But it never is. You can't take that back, either.

His co-writer talks about why [she doesn't view the comparison as making a ton of sense in an interview](https://www.thewrap.com/pig-writer-nicolas-cage-john-wick/). 

I do agree that they share some basic plot similarities but there is a huge difference between plot and story. The story John Wick tells is very much a revenge driven fantasy. The story Pig tells is way more introspective and focused on the actual feelings one reckons with when a loved one is gone. While I love the first John Wick movie, it simply isn't that deep at the end of the day. If anything, Pig fully subverts the vengeance wish fulfillment fantasy that audiences have come to expect from films like this, which pushes it even further away from Wick territory.",om7s20

It wasn't an entertaining movie to watch, and I didn't think it was the least bit though provoking. I will say that Robin's character growth felt completely unearned. This is kind of seen when he prepares dinner yet there is no emotional significance behind what should be a very personal, even sensual experience. All he wants is his pig. Maybe some people see it as a return, a rebirth , or something, but I think it was just another way he manipulated people.

He explains that anyone who would survive the initial shock is just ""waiting,"" and that minutes later they'll look up and see the tsunami that'll wipe them out - as he says this, he does that same ""looking towards the ceiling"" gesture.

The significance of this would still be up to interpretation, but I feel like the implications are pretty hopeful.  The point of his nihilistic ""big one"" story wasn't to suggest that he was right, but that his worldview was jaded and flawed.  By finally coming to terms with his grief, Robin has ""survived the earthquake"" - and now, he's looking up for a wave that won't come.",om7s20

h9cq2b6,"The clearly didn't hate each other, though it definitely sounds like they had a stormy relationship. The whole point of Robin cooking him the dinner they had had together that one time was to remind him of who he once was. Presumably after she attempted suicide he 'toughened up' and built this wall around himself as a reaction to his grief. Robin broke through that wall which caused his emotional breakdown at the end.  

None of that whole sequence makes any sense if he hated her and was torturing her, and it would also be at odds with the movie's themes of loss and grief.",om7s20

hboxudl,"I really don’t think he was! At the beginning of the movie he can’t even handle listening to the tape his wife made for him. The entire plot of the movie centers around him isolating himself because of that grief. The theft of his pig was the reason to go out into the world and start dealing with that grief, and forced him to start making connections with other human beings again. The whole movie is about different people learning how to deal with or accept grief in different ways. They don’t give us any reason to think he’s going to kill himself based off his character — if anything they’re showing him going through growth, because he says to Amir that if he didn’t look for her she’d still be alive (in his head), and Amir says she wouldn’t be. They’re both learning how to accept grief and move on by the end, which is why he can finally play that damn tape, IMO",om7s20

h6vatio,"That’s a little joke at a certain haute cuisine crowd, but I think it’s also in line with the themes of the movie.

There is often beauty and growth in “deconstructing” things (and obviously *re*-constructing them), which is a theme of the movie seen in the Rob’s house and Robin’s old restaurant scene…but what *really* matters is the elemental things, the things you *can’t* deconstruct.

In my mind, the scallop thing (really the scene at large) rhymes with what I consider the emotional climax of the movie, the “she’d still be alive in my mind…no she wouldn’t…no. She wouldn’t” scene.

Rob is trying to deconstruct grief and loss, but grief and loss are like a sautéed scallop…they *can* be used to build other things, but they *can’t* be deconstructed, and for the most part they just kind of *are*.

Then he goes home and stops trying to rationalize anything. He washes his odyssey away into the stream, and he embraces the fact that his wife is lost, but she was once there.",om7s20
