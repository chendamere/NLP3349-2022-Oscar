d2vxhgj,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good they were able to do in a short amount of time for each character. They used really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc. 

Screenwriting genius, really.

Same with the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' thing. That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got us caught up in the background story; then, it gave us an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed us that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which THEN set up the stage for the reveal that incited him to attack Bucky later; AND THEN it showed what Tony Stark does in his downtime (inspire and fund clever kids and research); **AND THEN** it set the stage for the woman who confronted Tony and blamed him for the death of her son in a really clever way - she chided him with how easy it is for him to give away money and look good while causing grief and anguish on the other hand **AND AND THEN** it influenced his decisions with the regulation issue at the same time!

I mean, seriously. This was all in the span of, what, 4 or 5 minutes, tops? These two scenes, and many others in the film, managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff at the same time (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) at once, and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

I really feel that this movie is going to serve as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. They've really done something remarkable here.

It's very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting over the past decade.",4i35uf

d2v07fj,"X-posting from r/marvelstudios:

Still trying to process all of this. Incredible film. Here's a few things I've noted:

-This is the second time where there wasn't a title card or opening credits at the beginning of a Marvel film. Winter Soldier did this as well. I love how we just go right into the movie.

-T'Challa putting on the ring of T'Chaka was totally him summoning his spirit, right?

-There was a weird exchange between Bucky & T'Challa during their fight where Bucky is brainwashed again. Something with his arm. Wasn't sure what to make of it. Bucky's arm isn't vibranium, right?

-I love how Zemo's character was reworked from the books & he's actually one of the better villains in the MCU. He had very clear motives & his goal wasn't ""Destroy the world!!!!"". Also shows how the fallout of a battle that the heroes have can really hurt them afterwards.

-The same doesn't go for Crossbones though. I would've liked to see more of him, but if he was all for nothing but revenge, then it was best for him to go as early as he did. Also, he was basically the Nitro of the film.

-Also, now that I think about it, did the bioweapon he went after have any significance? So much happened that I completely forgot about that.

-Doesn't Ross kind of hate the Hulk? You would think there would be some banter regarding it.

-My heart jumped when the word ""QUEENS"" came on the screen.

-My theater clapped for Giant Man, that was amazing. Also, ""I am your conscious!""

-We're totally getting the ""rogue"" Avengers in the Black Panther film, right? At least Captain America & Bucky? Also, the irony that Captain America can't go back to America right now.

-Damn, Aunt May...

The Russo brothers are two for two. I know it's the hype getting to me right now & my opinion might change, but this might be my favorite MCU film.",4i35uf

Can't wait to see what they do next, in stand alones or the next Avengers.

Also, considering how relatively small a part it was, I was really impressed with Brühl as Zemo. I think it'll take a hell of a lot to get a villain as good as King Pin or Killgrave, but I reckon Zemo is the best single appearance we've had.

The only thing he didn't succeed in was getting the Avengers to actually kill each other. Iron Man for all we know still hates Bucky. Cap is still trying to protect him, now with even more help from Panther who has had a change of heart.

Half the Avengers still signed on the dotted line on the Sokovia Accords, while half did not. Even though he wrote Tony that letter expressing his desire to help the Avengers should they need it, no member of Team Cap can operate unless they wish to be arrested. Hell, not only can they not operate, but they are WANTED FUGITIVES after Rogers busted them out of The Raft. It's even implied that Widow is a fugitive as well because she helped Rogers and Bucky escape on the Quinnjet. Remember Ross' answer to Widow's question when she asked about the possibility of not signing the Accords?

>""What if we come to an answer you don't like?""
>""You retire.""

We all know Thanos is coming. The Sokovia Accords and the UN's orders will obviously go out the window when a galactic being like Thanos comes into play and the Avengers will return without interference from any government agency, but as of right now, at this moment in the MCU, Zemo has won.

d2unxkk,"This was the best Marvel movie to date, my favorite Marvel movie and pretty much as perfect of an adaptation as they could have hoped for. 

I think the Russo's truly understand the characters that they are writing because they absolutely nailed the whole dynamic of the story and both Tony and Steve's POV's. Neither one of them is wrong for believing in what they think is right, but it just depends on how you look at things. Even looking at the dynamic of characters like Falcon and Rhodey, two men of the U.S. Military split on this issue; Rhodey, the veteran member who has learned to trust and follow in the government while Sam, the younger member of the military still having some hope and belief in the good of people. The film just really nailed the character dynamics so damn well. 

The movie had great writing, great action sequences, emotion and, more than anything, heart. Steve's belief in Bucky and the inherent good of people is such an awesome thing to watch on screen, I seriously love Chris Evans and how well he nails the character. I was also really pleased with Baron Zemo and the intelligence that they finally gave a villain, so I'm really hoping and looking forward to a future return from him as well. 

In the end, I'm also okay with the consequences that came from everything. While I would like to, at some point, see writers and directors push a Marvel movie to the point where someone dies, I was happy with the choice to only paralyze Rhodey. The whole scene stems from Tony pushing too far for once. Rhodey will go to the end of the Earth for Tony, especially when they both believe in their cause, and to watch his fall happen because of his own choice was executed really well. There was nobody to blame but themselves in that situation.


On top of this the movie gives you so much to look forward to.

*  BLACK PANTHER AND SPIDER-MAN
* The groundwork for Vision and Wanda's romance
* Ant-Man and The Wasp and every comedic line Paul Rudd delivers. 
* Thunderbolt Ross and the chance for Rulk
* Vision mentioning the Infinity stone in his head and it ""not being of this world"" 
* The return of the great Helmut Zemo 

The Russos nailed this. Seriously. Civil War has it all and I really really cannot wait to see what they do with the Infinity War movies when handed the keys to the kingdom. More heroes, larger scale villains, a crazier story to play with and a larger time-frame spread across two films. Holy shit, well done Marvel, this is what I was hoping for from BvS: DoJ.  ",4i35uf

d2uqcge,"Let's all take a moment to appreciate just how well-balanced the entire film is. No character is underused. Almost all of them get development, and the ones that don't make up for it by getting to shine in the action scenes like Ant-Man. 

The plot moves at a pace that is neither too fast nor too slow. It's the longest MCU film but it really doesn't feel like it at all.

This is not only my favourite MCU film, but one of the best comic book films, period. It belongs up there with The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 2, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. I can't wait to watch it again.",4i35uf
d2unedh,"Easily the best Marvel movie so far. That was some fantastic acting from Chadwick Boseman in every scene he was in. He definitely made me want to read the comics.

I really expected Captain America to die. I think one of the best parts about this movie is that both sides had the good guys, so the ending was up in the air. 

I'm a huge Spider-Man fanboy, and I am so impressed with this one. I couldn't wipe the grin off my face whenever he was on screen. I'm so excited for Spider-Man: Homecoming now. A teenage Spider-Man will be so much more fun than the other ones.

I was giggling for a few minutes after that car scene with Falcon and Bucky.

d2undtv,"I think it's a perfect comic book movie and that's basically because they know that a 'comic book movie' isn't a genre per say, so we've got the most breath-taking action Hollywood blockbuster since 2013. They managed to make everyone throw a punch in a scene which could ask for it. It's not only justified but a high class fan service.

The actors made the characters the best they could be. Robert Downey Jr. with some fine ass acting making Tony Stark the three dimensional character he used to be in the comics; an utterly charismatic Falcon with an equally charismatic Anthony Mackie owning the military vibe right at the beginning; and Scarlet Johansson being the Black Widow especially in the scenes she don't fight. These were for me the highlights in cast full efficient performances.

I don't even go in detail about Peter Parker and his Spiderman because it's needless to mention. **""HOLY SHIT!""**

It's 140~ minutes, but it messed up my time perception right away, making me nervous each time I thought the ending was close - and that's some amazing pacing.

Just before I sat down in my chair I realized that, having watched only the first trailer, I knew nothing much about the movie. I read some big ass rumours, but they were just rumours so I realized ""*holy hell, I don't know for sure how it's gonna end*"". And again the movie messed up with me. When the secret group of winter soldiers appeared, I finally *understood*. ""*Oh, that's how both groups will reunite - Zemo will use this group (perhaps Thunderbolts in the future?) and then they will reunite*""...

This reinterpretation of Zemo's character, working his background to fit MCU and making him not the true antagonist, that was just delightful. Having the movie to end with his apprehension made by a supporting character and without showing the protagonists (his victims) reacting directly against him, unbelievably changing the status quo... that was even more delightful.

Unlike the comic book source of inspiration, we could actually be undecided about which team we'd go for. And when the plot thickened, making the whole moral confrontation (which had seemingly ended) into a personal conflict, I felt this great pleasure of watching a perfect balanced movie. I got out of the theather not knowing how to express the happiness I was feeling because of that and because I got to see a bunch of super-heroes punching each other, which is the basic premise of this great work.",4i35uf

Now in [Captain America: Civil War](http://manapop.com/film/captain-america-civil-war-2016-review/) we see that Peter Parker has a real shitty costume with goofy goggles and that it's Tony Stark that gets him the cool looking costume.

d2unxf9,"This was fantastic. Simply fantastic. Where do I even begin?

I loved the opening at the Hydra base. Intrigue and mystery, and the Winter Soldier. 

I really enjoyed the first Avengers mission. Taking on Crossbones and his goal to obtain...the bio-weapon. It did exactly what it should--establish the new team dynamics, notably the rapport with Sam, Wanda and Steve. There was wit, with Sam's affection for his robot-bird; there was hand-to-hand; there was more mystical combat. Excellent all the way around.

Everything in this movie really worked. The motivations for most of the cast were clear--oversight versus personal responsibility. And the fear of losing control. 

Black Panther damn near stole the show. I doubt his screentime took up a total of an hour, but it was superb. We are introduced to him, we see his love for his father, we see his quest for vengeance, we see his willingness to do whatever it takes, and we see him come to the conclusion that, no, revenge is not worth it. This was an origin story that was beautifully executed, and it was the B-plot! And I honestly thought he was going to kill Zemo. I cannot wait for the stand-alone film!

Ah, Zemo. While he was no Loki, he was still a stronger villain than most of the stand-alones. He reminded me a bit of the Joker, wanting to watch the world burn, but also a bit of Two-face, seeing as he is consumed by revenge. In any event, he was head-and-shoulders above Tony's villain.

And that fight scene at the airport was just spectacular. Everybody had something to do, and they all bounced off each other wonderfully.

I loved it. Simply loved it. ",4i35uf

Had to swallow his pride and admit he was wrong to Cap, just to get a sucker-punch with the video and being more or less betrayed by Cap. Shit.

So much of what he does throughout the airport scene, like everyone else, directly informs the audience of his character and abilities. We all know what Spiderman can do, but this is the first time we've seen him in this context so it felt revelatory in some instances. 

For Example:

-One of my favorite moments in the entire film is when Spidey is fighting Bucky and Falcon. Spidey is busy with Falcon while from behind Bucky rips off and launches (a presumably heavy) wall advert at his backside. Spidey says something akin to an ""Uh-oh"" line while the audience sees in the deep background the object hurtling towards him. Quickly he dodges and then redirects it back towards Bucky with another quip ""You dropped something."" Just like that we see his spider sense in action and how his arrogant and boyish attitude shines through his actions. No need for some gimmicky visual or auditory clue, just a character acting real in a situation that showcases their abilities. Show, don't tell. Lots more fun that way.",4i35uf

Before I get to the awesome stuff, let me just say this was also a very politically rich film (makes sense given this was the same team behind Winter Soldier). Like, this was basically Individual Freedom vs. Authority: The Movie, and it was great. I'm not gonna shit on BvS because I liked it more than the critics did, but THIS is how you do a movie about superheroes with different ideologies fighting each other.

Now for the awesome stuff.

Every single doubt I had about Tom Holland has been completely washed away. Hie interactions with Tony were wonderful and I am really looking forward to seeing them banter more in Homecoming. Chadwick Boseman was wonderful and so was his scene with Zemo at the end.

The interactions between all the heroes were great, especially during that big fight.

d2vdaoz,"Quick thoughts, spoilers all:

* The opening scene was confusing at first, but had a great payoff.

* Great action sequence with Crossbone. Cap's shield play was the highlight for me.

* This is truly a Captain America movie, even if it feels like Avengers 3 at times.

* I should have re watched The Winter Soldier before this. The whole story was very Bucky-centric.

* Just when I'm thinking, ""Man, where are Hulk and Thor?"" they explain why they're not around and tie that into the conflict of the film.

* Nice set up with Tony's virtual reality memory scene. Did not see that twist coming.

* Excellent world building in the wake of Sokovia, pulling at Tony's guilt, and with the motivation of the villain. This was one of the best Marvel villains to date, just because his motivations were so simple and understandable.

* Black Panther was cool, his arc really tying the ending together. 

* Spiderman was the best part of the film. Handled perfectly. Referenced, but didn't shoehorn, Uncle Ben. Excellent action and perfect one liners.

* I felt, much like Batman v Superman needed a quick ""Lex Luthor kidnapped my mother to manipulate us into fighting"" line, this movie needed Captain to explain to Tony in a little more detail that Bucky was brainwashed and that the villain was trying to control a bunch of other Winter Soldiers before the fight went down.

* How did the villain know that Tony was going to show up in order to show him that video?

* Then later, right when I was again thinking it needed to happen, Captain tries to explain to Tony that Bucky was brain washed when he killed Tony's parents. Tony's ""I don't care, he killed my Mom"" was an excellent emotional core of the final conflict.

* The Vision / Scarlet Witch plot seemed extraneous. Black Widow was just kind of along for the ride. Hawkeye and Antman were great in their roles.

* Captain's shield drop was bad ass.",4i35uf

I feel like all Steve should have needed to say to Tony was ""Remember NYC, when they launched *a fucking nuke* at The city? And you disagreed and diverted the nuke into space and saved millions? What happens when they launch another nuke and you can't disagree anymore"". End of argument. ",4i35uf
d2upzlv,"So I loved this movie. That said, I feel really strange about how it treated Tony, especially towards the end. After the airport fight, Natasha berates Tony for having a massive ego, but he's the one trying to keep the team together and keep them in check through outside balancing. Doesn't that mean he's actively ignoring his ego? And in the Raft, Clint and/or Wilson take jabs at him for causing Rhodey to fall and nearly die. But that was actively Wilson's fault (and Vision's to a degree). Even in the end, Tony is actively helping Rogers and it turns out Rogers was keeping the fact that Bucky killed the Starks from him (which, also, when did Cap find that out?). 

It's like for once Tony is the one not being reckless and trying to take some responsibility for his actions and everyone just shits on him for it, even people on his side, like Natasha. Even that last scene where Rogers sends him the message saying that he'll come if Tony calls, as if Rogers has the moral high ground. Sure, he was technically correct, but the entire point of the pact was that the Avengers acting on their own are reckless and take needless risks. In this film, an airport had to be evacuated and millions of dollars of damage was caused because Rogers spent more time looking out for  Bucky than he did for his own team. Hell, Rhodes nearly gets killed because of Rogers' and Bucky's actions. In some sense, it treats Tony losing control at the end like he's the bad guy here. Despite the fact that, you know, Bucky killed his parents.

It's an amazing testament to this movie that I feel this conflicted about how it treated Stark. It just seems that the movie respects the Cap's viewpoint more than Stark's when I think it should have been more neutral. I'm going to give it some time, but this is easily up there as one of my favorite MCU films.",4i35uf

Bucky and Falcon giving Cap the smirks after he and Sharon kiss.

Spidey pretending that after Cap and Ant-Man beat the crap out of him that they were high school bullies.

Ant-Man (inside Iron Man's armor): ""Hello? It's me, your conscience! I know we don't talk much.""

Iron Man blatantly hitting on Aunt May




Admittedly my only real issue with the film was how Baron Zemo's entire plan was to somehow manipulate Stark and Bucky into the same room so he could reveal that Bucky killed his parents, stating that he wanted the Avengers to kill each other.

Problem is that Bucky never was an Avenger, so it made no sense to me why he was so pre-occupied with the one guy there (well aside from Black Panther and Spider-Man and Ant-Man) who wasn't even an Avenger.

d2v8xzo,"In the 30ish minutes that Spider-Man was in the movie, Tom Holland absolutely nailed everything that makes me love this character so much.  

The nervous, youthful energy he brings paired with the fact that he can become very serious when needed, him being a young impressionable teenager but also being more mature than most kids his age, the chip on his shoulder about not saving Uncle Ben and realizing how important it is to look out for the little guys (including his love for Aunt May and how he wants to keep her safe), and the humor. Good lord, I couldn't stop smiling whenever he spoke. And can we take a second to appreciate that this Peter and Aunt May actually have slight New York accents? That small detail adds just a touch more realism to both of them that I greatly appreciate.

All in all, I know he hasn't been in the MCU for very long and this might sound premature, but as a lifelong Spidey/comicbook fan I think it's safe to say that Tom Holland is my favorite live-action Spider-Man to date and I absolutely can't wait for Homecoming. ",4i35uf

1.) The ""tree beside the river of truth"" speech lost so much of its punch with the way they delivered it.

Granted, almost everything except the most general plot notes have changed from book to film, but the film really undercuts the moral grounds that Rogers makes his stand on.

d2up1l0,"I just finished seeing an early screening and was pretty blown away. This could be recency bias but I feel like it's easily in my top 3-5 MCU movies. The Russos killed it and I am so glad we have them on board for Infinity War; I'm not sure anyone could handle such a massive team up as well as they could. 

* RDJ is so fantastic as Iron Man, it's impossible to imagine the MCU without him. The scene where he watches his parents get killed was heartbreaking and I don't know if any other actor in the movie could have conveyed so much emotion so subtly as well as he did. He was so great in the scene in Queens as well as the scene at MIT. I was **blown away** by how they made young Tony look so young. There was a lot of confusion in my theatre about how that was even possible and I have to admit it threw me off at first.

* Tom Holland is going to be the definitive Spider-Man. The writing in this movie was so perfect for him and it was really refreshing to see someone actually embody Peter Parker *and* Spider-man not just one or the other. I was blown away by how much screentime Parker/Spider-Man received, especially in the fight. It was a bit unrealistic that he'd be so strong in a fight against major players only ~6 months after he got his powers and just a couple of days with his new suit but I'm glad we got to see him in his full web-slinging glory.

* I'm so excited to see more of Marisa Tomei as Aunt May. I feel like she'll bring a lot of life and humour to the role unlike how doting the past two iterations have been. Plus it'll be great to see more awkward sexual humour about her from Stark in Homecoming.

* T'Challa is going to be one of the more popular MCU characters after this movie and I can't wait until 2018 for his solo movie. It was surprising to see that out of everyone on screen he was the most level-headed and mature. The car chase scene with BP and Bucky/Cap/Falcon was so well choreographed and really showcased why Black Panther is going to be one of the biggest players in the MCU moving forward.

* I'm really glad Zemo isn't dead. He has potential to be a pretty big player in future MCU movies and Feige really needs to build up a good repertoire of compelling villains. Now that we know his motivation he's become more of a fully-fleshed out character for when we inevitably see him again as Baron Zemo. Sidenote: Did Baron Heinrich Zemo not exist as a villain in the MCU? If so, I'm surprised that he was taken out in Sokovia. 

* I went into the movie worried most about the airport scene. It was really hyped up by critics and so I imagined it would probably be pretty ~~under~~*whelming*(?) but it turned out to be one of my favourite MCU scenes to date, only beat by the original Avengers group fight. Major props to the writers and the Russos for figuring out a way to make almost everyone a major player (if you thought Hawkeye was out of his league in Ultron, even moreso here). Scarlet Witch and Vision were underused, likely because they would have been too OP otherwise, but it'll be great to see them fully active in IW. 

* Despite Vision doing very little at the airport I loved his more human moments. The cutaway to him in a sweater cooking for Wanda and the ""I've never eaten"" line was fantastic. I would love for the Wanda/Vision storyline to continue so that there's a possibility of them eventually having Speed and Wiccan.

* It was great to get some more development in the Stark/Pepper relationship but I continue to be disappointed that Pepper is pretty absent in the MCU. She's been mentioned in Ultron and now CW both times when she could have had a quick appearance. I'm not sure if she isn't included for timing reasons or if Paltrow is not interested, but her presence is missed. I'm hoping that if we get an Iron Man 4 in Phase 4 that we get more Pepper, potentially as Rescue. 

* Paul Rudd continues to shine as Ant-Man. I was worried that he would feel shoehorned in but the way they wrote his character to be in astonishment of the Avengers made him feel like a natural addition to the team. I'm surprised, but so glad, we saw Giant-Man so soon after Ant-Man, and it was written so well. Aside from Spidey, Rudd was given some of the best dialogue in the film. *""Someone just went inside me!""* Can't wait to see more of his character in Ant-Man and the Wasp. 

* Crossbones was under-utilized in my opinion. It was a really dense movie but I was surprised he was killed off so quickly. They made Rumlow a pretty major player in Cap 2 and I was surprised to see him gone so early in the movie with very little importance to his character.

",4i35uf
d2urkpq,"I loved the movie, the Russo's really gave the movie a much more intense and serious tone and the stakes actually feel much higher than all the previous Marvel movies. Wasn't a fan of age of ultron at all with all the one liners and quips and unnecessary humor given the circumstances, so this movie was the perfect antidote to that disappointment. Was actually quite surprised with the amount of deaths and violence in this movie that I haven't seen before in the MCU. Felt more like the Netflix series in that regard.

Ironically Zemo felt like a much bigger threat to the Avengers, than Loki or Ultron given his capabilities. Really simple motivation, perfectly executed and realistic plan and amazingly acted by Daniel Bruhl. He was the catalyst to the Avengers' downfall and I really want to see him come back in the future.

I loved the fact that there wasn't a clear cut right and wrong side of the civil war. You could make a case for both Cap and Stark's stand on what the Avengers should be and its a real complex and intriguing moral stand-off with no easy answers and warrants a lot of discussion.

There's so much more to love i.e. The introductions of black panther and spider-man were great, the airport fight scene was so enjoyable balancing between the stakes of the fight and the humor, ant-man/giant-man, aunt May is hot af. Every character had their moment to shine, amazingly well done. Overall I felt like this is the best Marvel movie to date since the Winter Soldier.

d2ux228,"Like everyone else, I have to commend Daniel Bruhl for his fantastic performance, as well as the writing behind it to make him such a powerful villain that was without actual powers.

Every character was really great in this film. This was a better Avengers movie than Ultron was and really makes me glad that the Russos have control over Infinity Wars (or whatever they end up calling it now).

There are two things that I'm happy/excited about that I haven't seen anyone really mention yet: 

1) General Ross, now the Secretary of State, is the only actor to come out **The Incredible Hulk** so far. This opens a world of possibilities (like possibly Tim Blake Nelson coming back as The Leader for an Avengers film or even Betty Ross returning for Banner).

2) Martin Freeman, the bureaucrat in **Civil War** wasn't evil. I think this is the first Captain America movie where they didn't have a real link to a Hydra villain or anything like that. I like how he's just some guy. I fully expected him to be evil in this movie just because it seems like the norm.",4i35uf

d2vytpr,"Great film for me it was a little bit (only a little) all over the place in the 1st half as the film was setting up the viewpoints of the different characters but after the ""Tunnel"" chase it went full steam ahead into what I think is one of the best 3rd acts in any superhero film in a long time. I thought they did a great job making each side while flawed but still good at heart that you could root for either one. It is definitely a Captain America film with the Winter Soldier supporting cast having more prominence over the Avengers (except Tony) in the film yet it also works as a sequel to Ultron making that film actually better in my eyes. 

Some things could be better like how the Sokovia Accords perhaps wasn't in the forefront as much though I do believe since they are kept in place that they'll play a major role in Phase 3. And I also agree some shaky cam during the Crossbones fight was a little too much though rectified in later fights. 

Overall though Civil War might be my favorite Iron Man and Avengers film with a very good villain in Zemo and a climax that favors emotion and personal drama over spectacle. I get why some people want the fight to be more about ideological differences but for me I prefer the more personal and emotional differences that result in a brutal fight. I also have to disagree that the film played it too safe. The Avengers are gone by the end of this film, Tony is a broken man, Steve walked away from the mantle of Captain America, Rhodey is paralyzed and it had a 3rd act which was NOT a team-up (great subversion btw). This film makes me even more confident that the Russos and Markus and McFeely will handle Infinity War very well. I wish the Black Panther and Spider-Man solo films were out tomorrow.

So how can the government guy, with a straight face, attack the Avengers for their ""collateral damage"" when in Avengers 1 the government launched a f'ing nuke at New York City? They even showed scenes of the Hulk breaking a few windows in NY to make them feel bad. YOU LAUNCHED A NUKE AT NEW YORK!

The whole ""collateral damage"" angle was the weakest plot point to me. Yea, a few buildings got smashed and some people died...should they have let aliens invade the earth instead? Should they have let the evil robot (granted, they created it) drop a city and destroy the world? Should Wanda have let the guy blow up in the middle of a crowded market instead of flinging him into the air? I know there is a political oversight angle there too, but trying to make them feel bad (and succeeding) for saving the world several times made no sense to me.

Still, a solid movie.

d2utk5l,Zemo's plan was better than Lex Luthurs ,4i35uf
d2url2k,Honest question. Who loved this movie AND BvS?,4i35uf
d2ux2kz,"Fantastic movie that to me, justified all the previous movies before it. They were a setup for this movie. 

Superhero movies are typically brainless, mindless fun. Laws of physics are thrown out the window. Fantasy is mixed in just for fun. But we know who the good guys are. They literally have gods on their sides. We know who the bad guys are - and they have a seemingly infinite supply of people willing to fight for evil, because the pay is that good. 

Civil War injects some truth into all of this nonsense and fun. It takes an actual moral and ethical question - how should we let the good guys figure out what to do, leave it up to them, and then judge them for their actions after, or should it go to some sort of bureaucratic committee. Should a person who feel that they are doing the right thing stand up for what they believe is right, even if the rest of the world disagrees with them? Are there any risks in delegating the decision making to someone else, in adding distance between who decides what happens, and those who enact it?

You've probably heard of the thought experiment of a train barrelling out of control towards a crowd of school children. There's a switch, and if you hit the switch, the train will instead kill one fat man, and save the children. Easy enough choice. But if you are asked instead would you push the fat man in front of the train to save the children, it *feels* different, and fewer people would agree to it. The same thing applies in reverse when you add more people in between, when you add more distance between an action and a reaction. Actions that cause the deaths of people become far easier to justify. It's what allows companies like GM to not recall cars, knowing full well that ~142 people would die due to a $0.90 faulty ignition switch. They're separated from the actual deaths by so many levels of bureaucracy, of committees deciding what is worth doing, what's the right thing to do. It becomes a matter of running the numbers, rather than of ethics and morality. This is what Captain America feared. This is what the movie brilliantly demonstrates, how decisions by committee can also cause severe, incidental damage to innocent people. Committees can be quick to decide, but are much harder to convince that they were wrong, to change direction if it's clear that earlier decisions were in error. Case in point - decades of failed policies on drug use. Decades of ineffective action on climate change. 

You may be thinking - well, okay, so in superhero movies, we should let superheros figure shit out. But in the real world.. Well, in the real world, the moral of the story still holds, because they're working with a fundamental truth. Committees, bureaucracy, governments by and large *fail* to do a good job of what we expect of them. Corruption, theft, outright fraud go unpunished while the little guy, who's a much easier target, will get decades for victimless ""crimes"". Watch the Big Short. Outright fraud is still fundamental in the financial industry. We're all victims of this, and yet they get away with it. Watch Spotlight. Kids raped, assaulted and abused, all covered up by governments, legal systems, even economic incentives within journalism that encourage a culture of secrecy. In the real world, our very bad guys do *very* bad things. And the good guys, who we think are the good guys, do a shit job of actually going after them. Why? Maybe because there's something fundamentally wrong with how we've delegated our decision making. Maybe there's something fundamentally wrong with the culture of secrecy that perverts every corner of our societies. 

What the actual fuck, you might be thinking. This is a superhero movie. It isn't actually talking about any of this. Except it does. It lays it out verbatim, without metaphor. To not give up that freedom to choose what is right is what Captain *AMERICA* is fighting for. He explicitly explains why it's so important to be able to stand for what is right, even if the rest of the world is telling you that you're wrong. Because those people who stand up for what is right are the ones who make our world a better place. It should make you question what we expect from our government. It should make you question how, given the reality of how decision by committee can warp our moral and ethical decision making way out of whack, what should we be demanding of these institutions, and what sort of power we should be giving them.

All that, and it was funny, action packed, and made for a great story. Watch this movie, and pay attention.

d2vjxq4,"I think that this film and the original Avengers might be the only two superhero films ever made that tried to do way more things than they had any right to try and do and succeeded fantastically. I might even say Civil War accomplished this a little more so, as the co-ordination of every character's motivation was something to behold. Despite having so many different players, no one was out of place. They all had a good reason for being there, and not a single moment was wasted in terms of character development, no matter how paltry the character's screen time was. The way the film moved from location to location, character to character, reminded me almost of an art-house kind of collage style, but refined for the most practical of purposes here.

I also cannot get enough of the style of action in Winter Soldier and this film. The sound design and choreography are unreal. You feel every hit, your jaw drops, you gasp at the sight of one hyper detailed movement or action, and you can perceive all of it happening. 

I chock this up mostly to the Russo brothers incredible directorial style. I'll use two of the biggest headliners as another example of why I think these guys are great: there's a moment where Black Panther is chasing Bucky, and they jump from a building. Bucky lands with a ""clunk clunk"" and keeps on trucking, and Black Panther follows right behind, landing with a... with nothing, almost nothing. Just the faintest sound of stealthy feet meeting pavement (this is such a little moment but I found it so cool, and only added to the intense presence that Black Panther had throughout). Another moment like this, but in a character development sense and not an action sense, was Tom Holland's brief monologue as Peter Parker. The absolute restraint in articulating the oft repeated ""with great power comes great responsibility"" made that scene so much more. The way that Peter phrases it (""if you have power and you don't help people in need, then what's happening to them is your fault"" not exact, but essentially) brought new complexity to the character, made you wonder whether it's a good thing that Peter's entire motivation is guilt. The Russo brothers understand that a non-moment, or a silence, can be just as effective if not moreso than your typical crash-bang-boom. It's that kind of savvy film making that has made these past two Captain America movies so dang good.

d2w5g6i,"In the words of Spider-Man, HOLY SHIT! This movie was fantastic, from the quips by all of the characters to the unbelievable action sequences, I wish they just kept whoever worked on this movie from director and executive producers to the light technician and sound boom guy for every single Marvel movie from here on out. 

I went into this movie with some residual hate for Iron Man because of what he does in the comic version of Civil War but the heartbreak he felt was felt by the entire audience in that scene where you could feel the tension while Zemo was destroying the Avengers.

I'm so glad they gave T'Challa and Spider-Man their full powers. There was no Toby McGuire lack of intellect or something of the sort. We got a Spider-Man who is equal parts genius and superhero. His lifting of the heavy objects and catching cars showed his strength while his quips and webbing showed his genius side. It seems like we finally have a fully rounded out, ripped from the pages, Spider-Man. In the same way, I was afraid we would get a T'Challa who was dumbed down or not the gymnast he is in the comics. I am so glad they pulled him straight from the comics. The warrior turned king had his own suit and bodyguards while also referencing the Necropolis and King of Death stuff. He showed his gymnast abilities and otherworldly fighting skills to hold his own in some of the fights and in my opinion had some of the best fight sequences. 

I also loved Sharon Carter using the line that Cap says in the comics about putting your foot in the ground, acting like a tree, and telling the others to move at Peggy's funeral. 

The bromance between the three Captain Americas was pretty endearing.

I wonder who else is held in the Raft and wish we saw some other familiar faces being held there. 

Zemo leading the Thunderbolts should definitely be considered in Phase 4 or 5 or whatever. 

Special shoutout to Ant-Man and Spider-Man and all their quips in the airport scene. 

I can't wait for all of the future Marvel movies. 

Something Strange comes our way soon.

Some of the best choreographed fight scenes I've seen, they actually stand out a bit more for me than the superhero fights. Every hit has massive weight behind and it looks so damned good. 

Did not feel bloated for me at all - everyone already had their stories told in previous movies so it felt totally fine that they pick up right where things left off and you can just run with it.

The movie also did everything it could to balance out the conflict between Cap and Stark to make sure that Stark didn't look like a villain.

Martin Freeman only had a bit part. Everyone thought that it was the death's of his wife and child that would involve him in the movie when it was Zemo's wife and child's deaths that catalyzed *his* involvement.

It was the fight with Crossbones and resulting explosion that was the inciting incident for the Sakovia Accords rather than the explosion at the UN. Though BP's father's death in said explosion was expected.

- Anyone else thought that Spidey was way too strong? He stopped Bucky's metal arm with just one hand.

- The whole thing kind of revolved around Bucky and after rescuing him, he just goes back to cryo? That makes me so sad and angry, haha. Did they have to leave it in that note?

d2x9vur,[deleted],4i35uf
d30504m,"Kudos to Marvel and Disney and especially Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. for what I felt was one of the more spectacular stories of guilt and how it is managed to come across a movie screen.

So much is made of the Geo-political implications and social issues surrounding registration.  The ""Civil War"" (To me) between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark wasn't as much about Patriotism, Pragmatism or any real global ""Ism"" as much as it was the two men externalizing how they handle their personal guilt.

Bucky was everything to Steve, he gave him companionship when he felt he didn't deserve it...gave him a purpose when he felt he was worthless, and ultimately gave his life so that Steve would be a success.  Steve felt responsible for not just what Bucky did...but everything he was forced to do afterwards.   Removing that responsibility would be akin to invalidating everything that Bucky sacrificed for him, and everyone else that he cared about.


Conversely...Tony Stark was by all means nothing more than an arms manufacturer...selling weapons to high bidders and they were the ones who made the decisions where and when they'd be fired. 

Until tony became the weapon himself, a flying bullet making his own choices and suffering their very real consequences.  Tony desperately needed for someone else to make the decision on where and when to fire.  He didn't want the responsibility of bearing that guilt anymore.   


That was the conflict TO ME, I know others have written extensively on the subject and pull many different threads from it but that's the basis.

  A man who wanted to bear the weight of the actions of others.

 vs. A man who desperately wanted to be free of the weight of his own actions.

- I think Bucky and Sam's anti-bromance is amazeballs.

- Romance is so cute between Wanda and Vision! You can tell that Vision cares for her, even though we really have no back story on why.

- I really wish Marvel hadn't showcased Rhodes's injured-in-Tony's-arms shot in the trailer. I think it took away from the emotional impact, given that the audience then a) knows he'd end up gravely injured, and b) figures he'll not be dead, since who shows dead bodies in trailers? Get better soon, Rhodie!

d2xhar4,"This is as perfect a genre film as you will get in the modern era.

I've been thinking about it a lot and it does so many things so well. Welcoming in new names seamlessly without slamming us over the head with additional exposition. Introducing story arcs without splintering the movie that will surely become issues later (I'm looking at you Vision). Someone in /r/Marvel noted that it felt more like a comic book than previous installments, because even in a Captain America one he won't be isolated as the only hero in every issue. Despite that, the heart of the movie is still all Cap, and his having to choose between his past and his present, and the perception of what's right.

I've also seen a lot of comments negging on Zemo, who I thought was a great, non-traditional villain in the way Samuel L. Jackson was in UNBREAKABLE. It was extremely refreshing to see a villain fueled by revenge and hatred for being wronged. It was also refreshing that he was some normal dude who, by his own admission, would be able to accomplish anything with patience and motivation. And in the end, he's been the only Marvel villain whose personal plan hasn't been completely thwarted (yet)--the Avengers are fractured, half of them will be fugitives starting at the end of the movie, and relationships that for the moment seem unsalvageable. They are breaking apart from the inside. He didn't need to be a mega bad guy with a world domination plan. I think they did a great job humanizing him and there was enough to keep him from being two-dimensional.

Easily the worst part of the film, which wasn't even that bad, was the Deus-Ex moment of Peggy's death, which led to THE SPEECH, which requires a bit of belief suspension because it was so timely. But we, as viewers, have to do that all the time in every movie to some degree, and we're already buying into superpowered humans--this didn't seem like a big deal.

Lastly, characters finally got to breathe. The Avengers core is now free of their own exposition: we know their characters, motivations, personal histories, fears. It only took a nearly a decade to pull that off. And it might have seemed slow and plodding at the time in some movies but the payoff was Civil War and they freaking nailed it.",4i35uf
d2v13d9,"Calling it now: the airport sequence is going down in history as one of the greatest action scenes of all cinema. 

A literal dozen combatants, all with wildly different abilities and fighting styles, had a massive punch-up that went on for like 15 minutes, in a brightly lit wide open space. No shaky-cam or confusing editing to make it easier to film, everyone's personality was on full display, and every single participant was given a moment to shine.

What Fury Road did for car action scenes last year, Cap 3 just did for superhero fights.",4i35uf
d2wiptf,"Velcome to the Hydraulic Press Channel. Today, we have ze Vinter Soldier Bucky Barnes in our hydraulic press.",4i35uf
d2wbatg,"A few thoughts --

The first truly memorable and fleshed out antagonist in a Marvel movie since Loki had no powers or costume. Just a dude in glasses. 

The way War Machine's plummet was shot made it surprisingly terrifying. 

The winter soldiers fake out in the climax was impressive. Did not figure that would happen. 

The fact that it had me convinced for a split second that Cap might actually decapitate Tony in the end of the climax is a testament to the filmmakers. 

I know I'm in the minority but I thought the score for Winter Solider was awful. Henry Jackman stepped it up here but still not amazing. I'm frustrated by the lack of musical consistency in the Marvel Universe. We have heroes in this movie with great and previously established musical themes from composers like Patrick Doyle, Christophe Beck, Alan Silvestri, and Brian Tyler and absolutely none of that is referenced. Just a **huge** missed opportunity. ",4i35uf

d2w2vzy,"So absolutely loved the movie but just trying to get through Zemo's logic and plan.. 

Isn't he just the luckiest villain? 

1) Thank god the Accords are happening thats the start of tension between Cap and Tony.. which he couldnt really have known about at all

2) So he frames Bucky... which could have ended had the police just killed him.. thank god Cap got there in time.. which he couldnt really have known would happen

3) Well Bucky gets captured thank goodness.. I'll set him free and tell him to wreak havoc... But just as I hoped.. he escapes with Cap further adding tension to the situation between Cap and Tony.. which is pretty much a guess at this point

4) Cue winter soldier**s** plot and airport fight. At this point I've pretty much won right? I've already gotten the team to fight each other. The whole bunker siberia plot is superfluous.. oh and what would have happened if he beat Cap right there .. then guess what no cool bunker fight. Another huge variable that Zemo just couldnt have calculated

5) But I'm going to unify them by tipping Tony off to the Winter Soldier**s** plot so Tony comes flying to the rescue. (which only works if Falcon gives up his location which again is pure luck). Imagine if Tony doesnt get there in time or Falcon takes his sweet time giving them up... It's just Cap and Bucky versus Zemo.. which ruins the plan. What does he do? Hide till Tony gets there?

6) Anyways that works out.. all those things work out.. and ive got cap and bucky and ironman in siberian bunker. What do I do? I reveal my entire plan to them. ""I am explicitly doing this to tear you apart""... Doesnt that lower/hurt your chances of Tony reacting the way he did? Why even reveal yourself or your plan ..just put on the video..

Extra) Also isnt the existence of the video pure luck? In 1991.. on a long stretch of road. the car crashes in the one place that their is a video recording. This is poor planning on super assassin winter soldiers part... why not attack them in an area without a video camera which is likely 99.9% of that road. Oh and the whole leave no trace thing.. He shoots the video camera... thereby acknowledging it exists... a super assassin.. told to leave no trace.. does something that does nothing to remove said trace..

Anyways being super nitpicky.. Like I said I loved the movie. I get its a comic book movie. Just thinking too much.

That whole airport fight was 10/10, especially with antman and spidey

Kudos to RDJ and his acting as Iron man. Chris evans did a good job, but the emotion RDJ gave off, I just felt his conflict at every other turn. Every time he was about to get into it with cap or anyone else, you could see the regret in his eyes.

d2ux15i,"Things I loved:

1. The plot gets a 10/10 for me. Maybe the pacing was a bit iffy in the first half. It's really noticeable because here in Indian theatres they cut it off at half-time for an interval. And that really made me notice that hey, almost none of the things I saw in the trailer have happened yet. But after it got resumed it felt very comfortable, and in retrospect I think the first half COULD be better in terms of pacing but still it builds up calmly and it pays off well too. 

2. After they go to Siberia I was very interested to see how they'd divide Cap and Iron-Man and give us the 2 v 1 beat down, because it seemed like they were going for the ""greater evil"" thing. But they handled it perfectly. 
Robert Downey Junior's acting really knocked it out of the park imo. The final fight was so intense. Tony losing and then shouting at Cap to leave the shield because he didn't deserve it....just had me really involved emotionally. Really felt like Cap would kill him there for a sec. Well done.

3. All the Black Panther/Spider-Man scenes were 10/10. Tony standing there with his hand webbed to the door knob got me laughing so much. 

4. Bucky/Falcon interactions were the funniest scenes in the movie. 

5. The Dean's cameo lmao shame that I don't think even one other person in my theatre noticed it.

6. I liked how they handled Zemo. His plan worked after all. The scene with him and Black Panther was moving, and made you feel for the guy. 

Things I didn't like:

1. The action scenes were NOT as good as The Winter Soldier, barring that final act. Some scenes at the start were just shoddy, especially the ones involving Black Widow. Shaky cam, quick cuts, seeing her back whenever she faught, etc. 

2. The score...I can't remember one thing about it or one scene where I liked it. Unlike Winter Soldier where I walked out humming that main theme. 

3. The ""We're still friends, right?"" Barton-Widow interaction may seem funny at first but to me it was kinda weird and I think it should NOT have been there. Like why are you even fighting then? Is this play-fighting? Are you sparring for show? Really kind of cheapens the fight and lessens the gravity.

",4i35uf
d2uxb8n,"I fucking loved Zemo, he didn't want to destroy the world or anything. He wanted to hurt the Avengers just like they hurt him, when he put the gun to his head I was like ""Fuck man, he was content with just hurting them"" Then BP their with the fucking save. ",4i35uf
d2uxklz,"""Guys, they're not stopping!""",4i35uf
d2uxs1d,"Great movie, but if I had to nitpick one thing, it would be the lackluster soundtrack. There were just so many moments that a captivating soundtrack could have really enhanced the scene.",4i35uf
d2v1mcd,"Overall great, easily top 3 of the Marvel films. One slight quibble: How could Zemo have predicted that Captain America, Bucky, and Iron Man would have showed up in the secret Hydra base at the same time?",4i35uf
d2v29k6,"I had a blast with this movie. Stories were told well, apart from a few hanging points that got forgotten, the villain was interestingly focussed in his goal, and the supporting cast wove themselves well into and out of the story as was required. I frequently forgot who I was rooting for over the course of the film, due in no small part to Evans' and Downey Jr.'s performances.

I think they could have ended it quite easily at the cut to black when Cap drops his shield after beating Stark in Siberia.  
The little bits of closure at the end were a fine segue into the next movies in the MCU, but I could have happily left the theater in the aftermath of that fight.

Spiderman and Antman were well-handled - they turned up, played their parts, and left the film again as they became obsolete. I personally enjoyed the decision to not bother with Spiderman's backstory, since everyone and their mother (or aunt) knows it by now.  
Black Panther was a real delight. I have no clue who he is, but we got a strong introduction to the character, his motivations, and his fighting style without diverting the movie to cater for him. I'm looking forward to his solo movie.

Robert Downey Jr. did a fantastic job playing the emotions he was called on to play. I got really caught up in his performance before the airport fight, it's refreshing to see such a deadpan, snarky character break facade.

The scene-setting text was unexpected but pleasant; it felt like the Russos were crediting us with a bit of general knowledge, instead of spelling out ""Berlin, Germany"" or ""Queens, New York City"" for us like a disappointing amount of other movies.  
The presentation of screen-size white text also gave the impression of a few small series of events rather than one big long string, helping to break up the intimidatingly-long movie into more digestible segments.

Vision and Scarlet Witch got some great parallels at different points in the movie. Vision spent a lot of their scenes talking Wanda through her doubt and fear, then accidentally shoots down Rhodes, causing him to experience his own doubts.  
I particularly enjoyed his disdain for the pinch as a unit of measurement, but that's just me.

The buddy chemistry between Bucky and Sam was fantastic. I had a great time with their back-and-forth, especially in the scene when they were in the car and Cap was being romantic with Agent 13.

I enjoyed Zemo as a villain. It's great to see the series shift from the bombastic scale of previous villains towards a more character-driven conflict. Zemo himself was played perfectly by Daniel Bruhl, I hope we see more of him in the future!",4i35uf

d2vb9m4,"What really made this for me was Spider-man. Honestly he was my favorite superhero growing up as a kid, and recently I was losing sight of him because no movie really projected him well I guess. This movie, without a doubt, by far is the perfect Spider-man. Everything about his character is exactly how I always envisioned him, and what they really nailed was one very key aspect of his character that really makes him Spider-man. His punches are as quick as his mouth. He would not shut up, and I loved every second of it.",4i35uf

d2vmzbw,Is there any plausible reason why anyone in the Tony camp would think working with General Ross is a good idea? He hunted down one of their friends and wanted to experiment on him and turn him into a weapon. It's the only weakness I can think of for this movie but it's very glaring.,4i35uf

d2vr9z5,"I still think the Winter Soldier was better. It felt more tightly-plotted to me. I honestly think Civil War could lose the Sokovia Accords scenes and still be the same movie. You could still have Iron Man wanting to arrest Bucky and kill him at the end, you could still have Scarlet Witch under house arrest for inadvertantly killing some people, you could still have Zemo using the HYDRA footage to turn Iron Man against Bucky, etc.

That's a shame because the few scenes where they were talking about the registration act were some of the most interesting in the movie. I have to give it credit. I went into it saying, ""I don't want the Civil War storyline! I want them to continue the Winter Soldier storyline!"" and then came out of it saying, ""why didn't they focus more on the Civil War storyline!? It was way more interesting!""",4i35uf

Why the hell are **German** Special forces coming to arrest Bucky? The bombing of the UN conference happened in Austria, he's in Romania, and he's wanted primarily by the United States. Germany doesn't even have any forces in the region. The closest german troops would be those stationed in Kosovo with KFOR - hundreds of miles away and not ready to leave at a moment's notice.

d3488l7,"- It juggles 13 main characters and they all get a complete character arc with unique emotional and interpersonal challenges.
- At the same time, it's a grounded story ultimately about Iron Man, Cap, and Winter Soldier. The whole movie hinges in the end on these three men and their friendships and antipathy to each other.
- At the same time, it's got huge geopolitical scope and consequences and really thinks seriously about that. It's the movie where the Avengers and the audience both have to contend with their bombastic summer fun coming at a very real, tragic, human cost. And it doesn't offer any easy answers to that, since there are no easy answers.
- It's a textbook on how to stage and choreograph gripping fight scenes when the audience doesn't reasonably expect any of the combatants to be in serious danger. The climactic fight in particular has huge emotional stakes, and all the action scenes assign each player in the fight an interesting and unique set of objectives and play with how those objectives conflict with each other, instead of just dudes punching each other. Plus, each fighter has a unique physicality and style to their actions that suits their personalities and powers and is so visually stunning.
- It's got the best Marvel movie villain since Loki. I might even like Zemo better than Loki, he's such a rich character, there's nothing easy about him, if that makes sense.
- It NAILS Black Panther. He's proud but not arrogant, deeply intelligent, feels a huge responsibility to Wakanda and his role as its protector and leader, damn proud of his country and its culture, and his action scenes have this beautiful grace to them.
- The single best live-action depiction of Spider-Man. The cockiness and sass of Garfield's Spidey, the emotional vulnerability of Maguire's Spidey, exactly the right acrobatic style to his movements, the bad jokes, even his ""thwip!"" sound effect was satisfying!
- It's simultaneously a comic-book-y superhero movie in the vein of Avengers, and a serious sociological and psychological movie in the vein of Dark Knight.

Other than that I really liked Ant-Man in this film, although im disappointed he didn't actually control any ants in the movie ( perhaps using the ants that conduct electricity to short out, say, warmachine's guns? ) And as for Spiderman, I think Holland is by far the best spidey we've seen yet. nerdy and awkward while still maintaining his witty one liners, his line ""you have a metal arm, that is so cool dude"" sums up his character perfectly.

d2unh2h,"Fan-fucking-tastic movie. Best marvel movie yet imo. Loved everything about it, especially spiderman, super excited about his movie coming out. ",4i35uf
d2uxqzo,"Few things I loved. The Villain made sense, He didn't have to be an army himself (Ultron), He wasn't some massive presence to destroy, he was just a guy who had a vendetta. The action made sense. The airport scene was brilliant, everyone but Spidey and the Witch is pulling punches because they're fighting their friends. Black Panther's dad had 3 lines I think in the movie but they show the love and respect between the two and it's a moment when the dad dies. 

I don't think I've been in a movie where the audience reacts verbally like I heard in this movie. The theater groaned with that ""oh fuck what have you done now"" groan every time we went deeper down the Bucky rabbit hole. War Machine's fall was brilliantly done because it felt so much like a hero moment where someone would swoop in and save him, there was a shock when he crashed down, there was a gasp when Tony blast's Falcon. This movie was so well made, The new Spider-Man is fantastic, The Black Panther was done wonderfully, and genuinely I think it takes a movie like this introducing them to get them started. I don't need another Parker origin movie and they didn't do that, Stark ask's why he does what he does and he doesn't bust out ""with great Power"". I don't know Black Panther's backstory but I'm pumped as fuck to see a movie starring him. ""I'm a huge bad ass who can hold his own with anyone"" and being a king in Africa is all the back story I need, he's interesting just from this movie. 

I loved this movie. I think the massive cast was handled well and everyone was interesting and their motivations for doing everything they did made sense, they were made more interesting without laboring over the development. I'm more excited about seeing all of them in another movie. The exclusion of 'the big guns' in Hulk and Thor was perfect. It made the fights more even and you could understand how strong everyone was and why they were dangerous. Cap vs. Spidey was the best example of this, Cap was simply more experienced, Spidey was faster and stronger and had webs buck Cap kicked his ass because he knew how to fight.... Same vs Iron Man. 

I loved everything but the location changes in this movie.... I didn't like the massive letters across the screen. It was a stupid use of a shot that could have been put in the corner while things were actually happening. Instead they hit us over the head with the fact that we were in a different place. ",4i35uf
d2vbntz,"10/10 Movie, I loved every second of it.

*HOWEVER,* I just need to get these tiny nitpicks of my chest. Sorry!

- How come when every soldier had the chance to shoot their intended target, they just watched the fight until Captain/Bucky/Widow ended up grabbing their gun and kicking them into a wall??? Just shoot them!

- Why didn't Ant-Man save the mini-oil-tanker and enlargement disc until he was inside Iron Man's suit? That would've caused an oil tank to grow right inside of the Iron Man suit!! Instant-win!

- Where was Vision during the whole airport fight? I mean, he showed up, but he barely did sh*t. Perhaps that was a good move on the Russo Brother's part, since Vision is over-powered. But still...

- If Iron Man blows up the flight-tower to block the entrance to the Quin-jet, then why doesn't he just fire a Tank Missile at the Quin-Jet? Yunno, instead of BLOWING UP 1/3 OF THE AIRPORT?!

- If Wanda can remove poison gas from an entire building, hold a grenade blast in, throw Vision down to the center of the earth, and keep an entire flight-tower from falling... why does she only use defensive moves in the fight? Sure, she throws a few cars, but for the most part she just blocks death-punches and rubble.

I also thought the battle scenes weren't as good as winter soldier, I guess it can't be helped with all the super powers.

Even if you take slightly older PParker in college, that guy has a shitty photography business that's run with just the one client, himself, and he pays out the ass for his tiny apartment and college courses.

d2w3f53,"As a shameless MCU fanboi it's going to be difficult to keep this objective, but I'll try. Was it a perfect film? No. Did it have flaws? Yes. But damn it if it wasn't a treat to watch. Someone (Charlie Jane Anders, I think) said it was the Avengers sequel that Age of Ultron should've been and I completely agree. Every character was masterfully realised, with real, believable motivations that weren't jarringly out-of-character and didn't detract from their individual arcs (now spanning over eight years and 12 films in total). Juggling so many different heroes and giving them equal prominence in a high stakes comic book movie that wants to simultaneously be groundbreaking and original and also stick to Marvel Studios' tried and tested formula, all the while keeping the plot cohesive and the characters sympathetic is, we can all agree, a damn near impossible task. The fact that the Russo brothers were able to pull this off at all is nothing short of a movie making miracle. For that alone they deserve all the accolades they've been getting.

A common complaint about this franchise - perhaps justifiably so in some cases - is that the villains are often lacklustre and are evil purely for the sake of being evil. Not so this time around. For once, the bad guy is someone you can kind of relate to - maybe even see eye to eye with. Almost.

Oh, and Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa a.k.a. Black Panther is a masterclass in badassery and, while it's still early days, it's safe to say that Tom Holland is hands down the greatest Spider-Man ever to grace the big screen. This kid is gonna go places.

I have only one real complaint, but sadly it's not something I can get into without spoiling. Overall it was a pretty spectacular film and a hell of a time at the cinema, and probably in my top 3 or 4 comic book movies of all time. 9/10 would watch again.",4i35uf

CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR - 8.5/10

Okay, first thoughts. Seen this twice within 12 hours, one in normal, the other in IMAX, haven't slept, I'm knackered so there may be horrible spelling and bad explanations.

Okay...where do I start....there's so much here okay, let's some it up in 3 words. Emotional. Earned. Divisive.

This is almost a culmination of not just the Cap trilogy, but also the Avengers movies and the Iron Man trilogy, and to do that of 3 franchises is ****ing impressive. Add to that, this is almost assuradly the best superhero trilogy to date.

This movie benefited from a longer running time, but at first it seems pretty slow to begin with, but it's a great build up of tension as the final pieces on the chessboard take their places. It's definetly a movie that first and foremost puts character development and motivations at the front. And everything, and everyone, is juggled freaking great.

The two biggest hitters are of course, Cap and Iron Man, bringing both the emotional and logical conflictions between the two characters amazingly to life. While pretty much every other aspect of the movie varys from strong to perfect....this...this is what delivers the punch.
But that's not to say it's only them. No. Everyone is on fine form and really pulling out all the stops, in particular of course the 3 newcomers to the MCU, Black Panther, Spider-Man and Zemo. Everyone has their own arc, reasons for doing what they do and their chance to shine.

Not to take anything from our titular hero, but RDJ knocks it out of the park. We've seen the playboy arrogant jerk with a heart of gold and a one liner on standby, and there's nothing really wrong about that. But too much of it and it starts to drag. But here we get the Tony that I particularly wanted to in the second half of AoU. A World weary man, tired of the mistakes he's made, the damage he's caused and the loss he's suffered. The jokes and the quips are still there, but they are reduced and come at moments when it's either an actual moment of happiness or when it's obvious he's trying to keep up appearances. To see how far the character has come is amazing to see, and it's clear that he's not a villain, just a guy who realises the damage he keeps getting involved with needs to be addressed and if signing the Accords is the way to do that and keep the Avengers, his family, together, then it's the best option. And then the finale....fuuuuuuuu, it's heartbreaking. My nephew (5) was even like ""They should stop, it's really hurting now."" God it's intense.

The likes of Black Widow, Falcon, Bucky and War Machine do great jobs but I'm not going to go in depth with every ****ing character. However Vision and Wanda get their characters expanded upon and their romance is 100% developing. Wandas fear and lack of control is handled well, as well as her guilt. And Vision is still learning

Black Panther is a god. No really. The speed, the ferocity, every moment of him striking or intimidating just brought a new strength to the universe and Boseman is perfect. He's elegant and regal, his accent is bang on, motivations clear and his arc is very fitting. It's something that probably would fit in his own movie, but here it's still splendid. And the costume is gorgeous, as you can already see in the few shots and stills released. And he has probably the most badass lines of the movie.

Now....Spider-Man.
Everything you've heard about him, I agree with. This is THE Spider-Man. Holland is great as Peter and amazing as the web head. The moment QUEENS popped up on screen, several people applauded. And seriously, in the UK, that just doesn't happen. His origins are handled nicely, giving enough but not going into detail about a very retold origin story. And...just everything else. The good natured quips, the geeking out at everybodys equipment and powers, the admiration for the heroes he was with, holding his own against some of the most skilled fighters and of course getting on some peoples nerves.
We are in for something special if they can keep this up.

Ant-Man is another great addition to the story. Not particularly NEEDED, but it was hella fun to see his first interactions with the Avengers, he did his part and hell, he's got one of the funniest moments in the movie.

Let's get to the fight scenes. They push the boat out in terms of creative ways to fight, especially with the growing collection of powers and abilities. Most of the action pieces are spectacular and now.....that 17 minute airport battle. God damn, it's true....it really is the best superhero fight ever on screen. In the trailers and stuff it kinda makes it look like everyone has got their own person to pair up with and fight...and while I was fine with that and a few variations, this totally blew it out of the water. Characters swapping around, free for alling, tag team and awesome yet ridiculous pair ups with incrediably creative and fun battles...I never thought we'd see a movie where we'd see Giant-Man protecting Captain America and the Winter Soldier, while Spider-Man swings around him, wrapping up his legs and being brought down by a double uppercut from War Machine and Iron Man.

Critics have said the weakest part of the movie is Zemo. I disagree. He was a great villian. Honestly, he is loosely connected to the comic version that many know and while his backstory may be distinctly different, his characteristics that make him a formidiable foe are 100% still there. His plan takes patience and experiance for what he intends to accomplish, and with a fierce intellect he manages it. Hell, he's even sympathetic. I've also seen people claim that they disliked him cause they didn't want the Accords to be orcastrated by a villian. Well they aren't, Zemo merely takes this event as a huge advantage. While his plan seems really out of place and confusing, by the end of the movie it totally makes sense and isn't as hard to understand as you initally think. And honestly he get's a major bonus, for the simple fact that by the end of the movie, he wins. He succeeds in what he set out to accomplish. Not a lot of superhero movies can say the villian wins. Oh and there isn't a ""quip"" or joke involved with Zemo at all, he was played completely straight. He wasn't terrifying or downright intimidating, but what he managed to do proves that as a villian, he was very, very capable.

Bad things

- Shakey cam. I kinda noticed it the first time around but second time in IMAX it was pretty annoying and almost offputting. Luckily it's not like that through the whole movie, it occurs mainly in the fight in Lagos...I mean, wow.

- Speaking of which, the fight also seems sped up a bit...like, just a little...1.3x..I don't know why..but again its only the Lagos fight. And a bit in the tunnel chase...it's kinda jarring.

- Story problem. The Hulkbuster v Hulk incident should have been shown as well during the Accords meeting. That fight was totally pointless from a government and public viewpoint and caused unneeded causalties and destruction. Also the dark elf ship in London as well. For an in universe 'explanation' for them not being shown could be because well...Thor and Banner aren't there, and Tony doesn't need convincing since he has already made up his mind. As well as Steve telling Ross ""that's enough.""

- Crossbones was awesome looking, and had a cool fight. But it was too short, and ultimately I felt he ended up wasted....especially considering his original role in the comics.

- While not 100% needed, I wish we got a reason for Tony finding out who Spider-Man is.

- Where the **** is Fury and Hill? Not even a mention...that's really weird. I know the Russos said it would be addressed down the line but...odd.

- The fighting. Okay. I said it was freaking awesome. But during the second viewing, I noticed how some of the hits didn't seem to do much, or there was too many cuts in the action or ultimately some characters were thrown around like action figures and then act like nothings wrong. By the end of these fights there should be more than just black eyes and sprained arms, there should be broken bones, a bit more blood...it's kinda hard to describe, but it does seem a bit bip, bop

- I can already see the f**k ups Agents of SHIELD will make in terms of timeline/continuity. Not the movies fault though.

- Avengers have been operating for 4 years, yep, that's true. Then Vision states later that Tony came out as Iron Man 8 years ago. For us, yes, but in universe, it was 6 years ago. 

- ""Has anybody got any orange slices?"" ....man, that was a weak line. I understand what it's about, little league or something right? Maybe it's funnier in America, but I don't think international audiences will find it that funny...just, odd. I think a more universal line should have been put here instead.

But in summary, the story is tight, there aren't really plotholes I saw/can remember (well, one thing), the characters stay true to who they are while also developing more, and it's just a beast of a movie. For me it's personally getting harder to decide which Marvel movie is the best as well as putting them in order. My top 5 are

- Iron Man

- The Winter Soldier

- The Avengers

- Guardians of the Galaxy

- Civil War

But fuck me, it's becoming difficult to put them in any order.

I was thinking of doing a post to clear some things up that people may see as a plot hole or narrative problem...I've seen 

- Zemo's plan doesn't make sense/is stupid

- Vision was doing nothing in the airport fight

- Airport fight wasn't brutal and more like a friendly beat up

- Cap and Bucky shouldn't be able to defeat Iron Man

- Nothing changed. Tony and Steve are friends again.

- Tony bringing in Spider-Man was against what he was fighting for and he put a kid at risk

- Nobody dies so there's no stakes.

d2veddz,"From what I've seen, this is the best Spider-Man I have seen in a film. Some choices felt weird to me (such as a WAY younger Aunt May), but in my opinion, they nailed the character.

d2vfbly,"Paul Rudd just has so much charisma. Wait till he and Chris Pratt and Robert Downey AND Benedict Cumberbatch are sharing a scene together.

T'Challa owned it. I loved the way he moves. I mean, there's what, like seven hand to hand specialists in this movie and they gave each one their own distinctive style. 

I was unsure about Holland, but my GOD, did I fall in love with his performance. He's got all of Tobey's awkward, geeky charm, and bit of Garfield's wit but not nearly so mocking. At least, not yet when he's dealing with heroes he's just now allied with.

And I'm SO glad they didn't fully rehash his origin story even when Stark was asking for it.",4i35uf

d2x34m2,"Silly to mention, but I really dug the young Tony scene. CGI has improved so much, so fast just in the last five years. Compare this CGI Tony to Tron: Legacy's CGI Clu. Clu was chin deep in the uncanny valley. Young Tony? He didn't get uncanny valley until older Tony showed up and pointed out that everything was a hologram. Until then? It was like watching a RDJ movie from the 80's. 

The movie over all, I loved it. I like how the Russo brothers are basically making political thrillers but with capes. I wish more superhero movies would explore other genres but with capes. (DC isn't doing this with their movies but their show, Gotham is basically crime noir with capes. And like CA:CW, I love them for it.) 

When Peter showed up, I couldn't stop grinning from ear to ear. He was adorable. Just adorable. Exactly like how I imagined a real life Peter would be. Though it made me wonder, if Tony kept on eye on Peter, who else has he been tracking? I bet he has a folder on Matt Murdock. I can imagine Tony first discovering that he was Daredevil and going, ""Wait? So the blind the guy is Daredevil? The blind guy. How? Echolocation? Is he part dolphin? Dolphindevil?""

I got dragged along to see this with 5 other people who were super excited for it (2 of them even dressed up) even though I had zero interest in it.

Out of the 6 of us, I'm the only who liked the movie. I fucking loved it, and I didn't even want to see it.

I thought they were gonna have a terrible excuse for them to be fighting to the point where I didn't believe the malice between them, but I thought they did a great job. But I thought they were going to fight with each other and then near the end, settle their differences and fight Zemo and a team of 5 winter soldier people, kick their asses and be done with it. It looked like that's where it was going when Zemo went to the base where they were sleeping.

Then my whole brain was shocked when I saw the 5 soldiers shot in the head. Holy shit, that was great. And then Tony finding out the truth about his parents and saying, ""I don't care. He killed my mom."" 

This movie was so much darker than I was expecting, and they didn't team up for shit! The bad guy won!

As a DC fanboy first and foremost, it pains me to say that Marvel has better writers, especially when it comes to character interaction/dialogue. It's just so much smoother and flows nicely. There's just the right amount of humor and it balances out the serious moments perfectly.

Marisa would be well into her 60's by then, as long as she's not killed off in any of these films.

- My body is so ready for this Black Panther movie. I knew he was going to be dope, but he totally nailed it. Everything about that character is on point.

- Same goes for Spiderman. I love that he actually looks like a high schooler now, and they did a great job of using that fact for good comedic effect. I also liked that his quips during the fights were less ""sarcastic know-it-all"" and more ""awestruck kid"". In his eyes, this whole fight was just the coolest thing ever and I like that.

- Before now, I never thought about the fact that his ""Aunt May"" was always portrayed closer to ""Grandma May"". At first it seemed really weird that his aunt was so relatively young in this movie, but then I realized: he's a teenager, so why would *aunt* be 60 or 70 years old?

The pacing moved at a breakneck pace and I was surprised at how things flowed very well (for the most part). At its heart, this was a great character piece, and it was nice to see the emotional core of Iron Man/Captain America be the focus, rather than action set pieces and doomsday scenarios.

Spider-Man was good, Black Panther was better. RDJ deserves high praise for his performace. 

My only disappointment was that nobody died (again) although I appluad the decision to cripple Brodie. Also, I would've like to kept Cap's side locked up until Avengers 3, given that it leaves more questions than answers in between that time.

That is an important character we've seen a lot of with the first Cap and the TV show, and obviously she means a ton to Cap, yet I couldn't take her funeral seriously because it seemed to be trying way too hard to give motivation to Cap.

Relatively minor in the grand scheme of things though. I feel like I had some other minor complaints I thought of during it but I already forgot them because I enjoyed the film so much as a whole, so whatever. ",4i35uf

Spiderman grabbing Buckeys arm and Iron Man responding to Ant-Man with ""...Who are you?"" were hysterical!

Vision and Ant-Man continued to be amazing additions to the cast.  Also, Baron Zemo is a fantastic villain who they will actually bring back. IMO absolutely the best Marvel movie. ",4i35uf

d2va0fo,"Overall, I really dug this movie. I just wrote this elsewhere, but I really love comic book movies. I totally have some Marvel-fatigue and I have felt for a long time that they are formulaic. To me, Marvel MCU movies are like McDonald's. I'm dropping $7 and getting a  big Mac, large fries, and an ice cold coke.

I'm not expecting a game-changer.

That said, this movie was just so much fun. Once I look at movies through that perspective, I just let myself go along for the ride. It's going to be a little campy, a little hand-wavey with actual consequences, but I know that it's going to be just a good romp.

And that's what it was.

I did a marathon at the theater of Cap 1, Avengers, Cap 2, Age of Ultron, and then Civil War. It all followed pretty well. And as the first Avengers has dulled for me over time, I realized again, that the MCU is kind of like Super Smash Bros to me. Sixteen years later, Bowser isn't blowing my mind but it's so novel and awesome that we've got Cloud now.

I loved Cap and Ant-Man. Basically all of Team Cap I loved. There were some things I disliked but considering how much talent as being handled, it was all distributed well.

GIANT MAN! The second he was like, ""I've only done it once. And in a lab,"" I knew it was coming.

I liked Zemo in that he took an alternate route from what everyone else has tried to do to beat the Avengers. Not the greatest character and that all kinda dragged a bit for me, but whatever.

Also, another Community shoutout in the form of Jim Rash (Dean Pelton)! Maybe we'll get another one in more movies if the Russo brothers direct more, (Gillian Jacobs can Britta being Captain Marvel).

I'd give it a solid 8.5/10. I had tons of fun with it and loved all the Ant-Man dialog. Just a lot of fun. It held a little more weight than other movies. I think Winter Soldier just slightly edges it out still for me, but still, in my top three of the MCU so far.",4i35uf

*  The Lago explosion: This was in reference to the Stamford explosion that became the catalyst for the Registration act. (Super Human Registration Act in the comics; I forget what it's called in the film).  

*  The mother that talks to Tony and makes him the lead supporter of the SHRA also is in the comics.   
*  When Tony is discussing his reasons for supporting the act, he takes a drink. In the comics he's a recovering alcoholic who explains to the superhumans assembled that this is what he refers to as the moment of clarity. In the past he was drunk and in one of his suits when fighting someone and nearly killed a bystander, and would have if his opponent hadn't pushed the bystander out of the way.    
*  During the funeral scene the speech given by the niece (?) that Steve hears is a paraphrase of a quote from Mark Twain that Captain America says to Spiderman to convince him to join his side.    
*    Vision's shooting Rhodes out of the sky, nearly killing him paralleled the death of a different superhuman at the hands of someone on Stark's team.  
*  The climactic fight probably wasn't the final conflict. I suspect it mirrored the dual Cap and IM had while they just parlayed and we'll see the final fight in a future IM film.

As for the positives, the new character introductions were well played and their involvement in the airport battle literally had my heart pounding.  All the fights had me and even the big bad Zemo, in the end he won.  Very rarely, especially in this day and age where the bad guy wins.

The only real gripes I have are Barton's ever changing facial hair and it answers the question why you don't call the Avengers for everything (casualties skyrocket) you lose focus on the main character.  This felt like Iron Man 3.5 & Avengers 2.5.  Cap's there, but it felt less of his movie and yet it was the conclusion he needed, he drops the shield and is Captain America no more (a nomad even...).

In the second movie, Captain America starts a new bromance with the Falcon and his crazy ex-bro Bucky is back from the dead to haunt Cap. When Cap finds out, he tries to calm his ex and get him to remember, and somewhat succeeds.

In Cap 3, Cap is still in a bromance with the Falcon and pursuing his ex. Cap finally becomes bros with his ex again. It's a triple bromance until Bucky decides to stay frozen, breaking Cap's heart.

Giant-Man, Spiderman not shutting up, Wanda kicking ass and T'Challa in general were just great. Not sure right now if I can put it above *Guardians* and *Winter Soldier*, but this is a contender for one of the best Marvel movies period.",4i35uf
d2yh5z9,I didn't expect Antman to have such a huge role in this movie,4i35uf
d2yn8az,"Okay so as someone who is not a comic fan and only considers these superhero movies as popcorn-munchers, they did a great, great, great job with this. It was a standard Marvel movie until the reveal at the end and the ensuing fight between the three, and I could not tear my eyes away, I could not decide who to root for, I could not believe the amount of pain I was feeling for a bunch of characters I only felt were nothing but quip machines before. That was GOOD. That was SO GOOD.",4i35uf
d2ypvtv,"Definitely enjoyed the movie -- Here's my breakdown on each individual's motive to join a side:

**Chris Evans / Steve Rogers / Captain America**
**Stance:** Anti-Sokovia Accords
**Reasons:** ""Politicians with agendas and agendas change.""

**Robert Downey Jr / Tony Stark / Iron Man**
**Stance:** Pro-Sokovia Accords
**Reasons:** Guilt and accountability

**Anthony Mackie / Sam Wilson / The Falcon**
**Stance:** Anti-Sokovia Accords
**Reasons:** ""The people that shoot at you, usually wind up shooting at me.""

**Chadwick Boseman / T'Challa / Black Panther**
**Stance:** Pro-Sokovia Accords?
**Reasons:** I'm not sure about this. The movie seems to implied that the Wakanda wasn't involved until that UN building blew up and they lost several of their people. Kinda awkward to have just one infraction upon a nation to suddenly lead the accords (albeit through his father) but toward the end had a chance of heart because of circumstance? Did I get the wrong idea?

**Elizabeth Olson / Wanda Maximoff /Scarlet Witch**
**Stance:** Anti-Sokovia Accords
**Reasons:** Irony is - its her hometown but also weary of government due to bad experience and Avengers being there for her and her deceased brother. Not to mention public/governments apparent distrust of her due to her history and power..

**Don Cheadle / James Rhodes / War Machine**
**Stance:** Pro-Sokovia Accords
**Reasons:** '117 countries wanna sign this. 117 countries, Sam, and you're just like ""Nah, that's cool.""' Note: I know he had a very good substance at the end when trying to walk, sadly I cannot remember what he said: words for words other than ""It's the right decision"" (though he looked like he had a hint of doubt and Tony Stark caught it..)

**Paul Rudd / Scott Lang / Ant Man**
**Stance:** Anti-Sokovia Accords?
**Reasons:** Intentionally or not, consistently on the wrong side of the law. Breaking & entering, stealing, blowing up a building, setting loose an oversize ants, picking a fight with the Falcon whilst stealing, the list goes on and it's clear he's not for the government but for him to be an actual ""ANTI-Sokovia Accords"" not so sure since he did not really share is viewpoint..

**Jeremy Renner / Clint Barton / Hawkeye**
**Stance:** Anti-Sokovia Accords
**Reasons:** Not sure actually. I had expected him to be FOR while Black Widow against due to their respective relationship with Captain America -- that is, Black Widow actually have some form of relationship with CA through Winter Solders and Avenger:AoU.. whereas Hawkeye...not a clue. Insights anyone?

**Tom Holland / Peter Parker / Spider-Man**
**Stance:** Pro-Sokovia Accords
**Reasons:** Clueless and easily influenced -- we all know how that turns out in the comic book... 

**Scarlett Johansson / Natasha Ramonoff / Black Widow**
**Stance:** Pro-Sokovia Accords
**Reasons:** She surprised me! I know she can be considered a strong ""government lackey"" but I had thought in this universe, it'd be different due to her strong working relationship with CA. However, I wasn't disappointed later on!

**Paul Bettany / Vision**
**Stance:** Pro-Sokovia Accords
**Reasons:** ""..the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. And during the same period, a number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensal rate. I'm saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict breeds catastrophe. ""Oversight""...Oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand.""

**Sebastian Stan / Bucky Barnes / The Winter Solder**
**Stance:** Anti-Sokovia Accords
**Reasons:** Dude's anti-everything! Still a bad-ass...

**Emily Vancamp / Sharon Carter**
**Stance:** Pro-Sokovia Accords
**Reasons:** I don't believe she was really given a choice but it's clear where her UNOFFICIAL stance is...

What do you guys think? I can see that the center of conflict is around this accords, but there are far more at play than just this -- so I enjoyed how the plot revolves around this centerpiece and add layer to the tension that was arising among the group..

d2uvxss,BvS and Civil War both tackled similar themes but the gulf in writing and directing is vast.  DC really needs to not use Zack anymore,4i35uf
d2vi9yk,"Y'know. That was about as perfect you could get with an Avengers movie. My only minor gripe is I wish Zemo's victory involved an Avenger death and not just Rhodey being temporarily paralyzed and Winter Soldier being put on ice indefinitely.

It would have hit a new level if even Vision was taken down. The Stone could've then caused a ripple effect allowing Thanos to pinpoint its location and make the moment weigh even more.",4i35uf
d2vjf10,"""A pinch of paprika..."" ",4i35uf
d2vq6ww,"I was waiting for this movie to let me down. The Winter Soldier fell short because I hate that they went with massive helicarriers crashing into DC when the rest of the movie had been better keeping the conflicts small and personal. I groaned at the idea of having 6 winter soldiers fight Iron Man, Cap, Bucky, and Black Panter, but that's not what happened. That would have been a smaller encounter, but I think it would have felt disingenuous. Everyone talks about how Doomsday was hardly a twist at the end of BvS, because of course they're going to team up at the end to fight the big bad. Civil War shows that, *no* you don't need to do that, and it even learns the lesson from TWS that it's third act climax doesn't have to be the biggest fight in the movie. 

Everything stays mostly grounded with the exception of the airport fight didn't feel contrived. It made sense that Cap would want a team, because he was preparing to fight 6 winter soldiers. It made sense that Tony wanted to bring him in, and it made sense that Tony would want to have enough support and firepower so that they wouldn't have to fight. The catalyst (because I won't call him a villain) also had motivations that made sense. Although I don't quite buy that he would know Bucky would cause such a riff in the team, he did know a piece of information that would put Cap and Stark at odds. All he had to do was figure out how to get them in a room to watch it. It's a *bit* of a stretch, but I think the payoff works because it works on an emotional level, not just an action level. As far as contrivances go, this is pretty satisfying, and I can't really come up with a way to do it better.

I really only have two negatives, but they're harder to articulate so they take up more space than the positives. The bigger complaint I have, is the way the movie jumps around at the beginning. It moves from the Accord to Peggy Carter to Stark's daddy issues to the catalyst doing shady things to introducing Spider-man to ect. Honestly, I enjoyed watching it enough it didn't matter. It honestly reminded me of The Dark Knight, which is fucking *everywhere* with the stuff with the mob, Harvey Dent, crooked cops, the Joker killing cops, assassinating the mayor. It's fine, it all comes together, it's just a lot. Again though, The Dark Knight does the same thing, and who doesn't love TDK? The other thing would be the way it handles Spiderman and Black Panther. Spiderman was amazing, but I question whether Tony would kill 24 hours just to get him. If Spiderman were removed, it wouldn't really affect the plot (the same goes for Hawkeye, Antman, and Vision, but the film doesn't spend any time explaining why they're there). Black Panther is given great motivation, but it's not explained where his abilities come from. Does he have superhuman abilities? How did he train? Was his father *also* the Black Panther? I can assume some of these things from talking to people who have read the comics, but it makes me wish we got a Black Panther movie *before* Civil War. It's the same complaint I had with Batman in BvS, but Black Panther plays a much smaller role in this, and gets less screen time. 

I want to simmer on this one a little more, but I think this may be my favorite Marvel movie.",4i35uf
d2vz7jp,"Movie was fun. Still like TWS with its spy theme but this is just wow. I made the loudest Yes with arm pump when QUEENS plastered the screen.

d2w0upu,[deleted],4i35uf
d2w4b3h,Something I thought was great was how Crossbones prepared so well to fight Cap.  The sticky bomb he used to force him to throw away his shield was well thought out.  The gun on the truck with impact shells that would be so effective against someone hiding behind a shield.  I wish they would have done more with him.,4i35uf
d2w4ncw,"I think people have already covered the positives, but there are a few things that stuck out to me as negatives.

* it seems like the creators don't really know what Vision in a fight. It's pretty clear no one outside of Scarlet Witch could really do anything to him, and even that fight wouldn't be very interesting as it would just entail her thinking really hard at him. Without the reference frame of the physical world, we as viewers don't really have anything to engage with. The airport scene seemed to almost entirely forget about him except for a few moments, despite the fact that he could take almost anyone out of the fight for good in a couple of seconds.

* I didn't think that Zemo was as great as everybody else did. I think his was an effective villain in that he successfully guided the plot and didn't take focus from the much more interesting 'civil war' that was going on (him not activating the other winter soldiers was a great decision). That being said, I certainly didn't feel he had much gratuitous on screen or even much character. Even after hearing him talk about his family dying I didn't have any real sympathy for him. I just really didn't care. It was interesting that his plan ultimately succeeded, but I'm not clawing for more of him in upcoming films like other people seem to be. 

That being said, this was probably my favorite MCU movie and I was pleased with almost all of it. ",4i35uf
d2w4qyz,You gotta admit... That kiss was weird as hell.  There was not a good build up to it! Marvel can't do romance... But that reaction from Buckey and Wilson was priceless,4i35uf
d2w5tqs,"I wasn't really all that personally invested in the Bucky storyline. I was moreso interested in the registration storyline. I really wanted to see more about the consequences of their actions and whether or not superheroes should be controlled but they kind of seemed to drop that half way through the movie and just went full Bucky. I mean, I kind of expected a very Buck-centric plot from the trailers but I just wanted to see more about the registration stuff. ",4i35uf

**1.** Cap is pretty much unstoppable when he has his shield

d2wk41b,"I loved how the movie gradually shows you more and more slimmers of Bucky's humanity so that the audience begins to develop a trust for him, and by the end, everyone feels incredibly conflicted by the conflict as they've seen Bucky's humanity but his actions, although they were not his own, were surely reprehensible.

Also, if you were Tony Stark, would you really keep watching that video the whole way through? Like, I would turn away and stop watching immediately.

Additionally, I find Zemo's plan a little hard to believe. Like, it was contingent on Stark figuring out that Bucky wasn't guilty of the bombing or anything, but Stark figured that out by happenstance and just on a whim, betrayed the document that he had signed. If Stark didn't do any of those, which was ultimately unlikely, then Cap, Bucky, and Stark aren't all in the same place and the plans fails. For a guy who has such a rigorous plan, it seemed to have a lot of uncertainty within it as well.",4i35uf
d2wlif4,"Scarlett Witch's attack on Vision... it seemed as though, more than using her powers to push him down, she was activating his density shifting powers to make him incredibly heavy. That's why he suddenly plunged through all those floors because he went from normal body weight to being as heavy as a truck. Anyone else read the scene that way? ",4i35uf
d2wneiv,"My favorite things about the movie are how they handle all the conflicts. Unlike the comics, Tony never turns into a villain. In fact he's fairly shocked when he learns all of Cap's guys got put in the Raft. I feel like they nailed the idea that neither side is really wrong.

Also, the tone of all the fights. The airport fight felt like a giant (heh) comic book come to life, it was really fun. But the last fight with Iron Man vs Steve and Bucky was anything but fun, it was intense and kinda *scary* at points. Everyone in my theater gasped when Steve raised the Shield over Tony then exhaled when he just took out the arc reactor.

Also, Holland was an absolute scene stealer. We've finally got the perfect Parker/Spidey.",4i35uf
d2wpexd,"I just want to see this movie again already! Wow. Funny people said Zemo didnt do much yet he was the most successful and emotionally compelling villain in the movies yet. And he's still alive!

Tom Holland nailed BOTH aspects of being Spider-Man and Peter Parker. 

My one qualm: How the fuck does PETER GODDAMN PARKER not know what an AT-AT is? Or what Hoth is called? Totally unbelievable. 0/10 wouldn't recommend to anyone.

I didn't expect him to be some massive villain, just something to get the action started, which he was. and spiderman... fucking spiderman. Tom Holland can have my babies. he is by far the best spiderman I think we have gotten, and a top class peter parker as well. like, combine the best of Toby and the best of Andrew and add a little spice and boom, tom holland. also, was the suit CGI? it looked so wierd. the airport fight scene was fucking beautiful, giant man being a BA, antman riding hawkeye's arrow. i can easily say this is the best marvel movie and I strongly reccomend you watch it.

I was going into the movie thinking ""This 'civil war' is a joke, with like 6 heroes on each team"" and that the Civil War storyline would not be given justice with all the limited fleshing out of heroes, etc.

But I'm greatly surprised walking out of the theatre after that. I've watched it twice, and both times still had me enjoying the film so damn much. The only gripe I had with the film was how little emphasis the Sokovia Accords had near the middle to end of the film, and like many here have stated, the film could still have been the same without it.

However, every other thing about the film was amazing. The fight sequences, the humor, the tension building up between Cap and Iron Man was so well done. The airport fight clearly showed the capabilities of each hero so well (especially Spidey and Antman) but the part where Black Panther was trying to get to Bucky while Widow zapped him was pretty dumb.

What I liked the most about the film was the plot, it kept the tension between both teams high and gave both of them a reason to fight since everyone had a stake somewhat and seeing Wilson telling Cap and Bucky to go as ""the only way to win this fight is for some of us to lose it"" really sealed the deal as we were shown the stakes riding on that fight. Probably the best fight sequence to date in any MCU film so far.",4i35uf
d2w0wmp,My only complaints were that Captain didn't give his big speech to Spiderman,4i35uf
d2w21au,"Loved it. Loved especially how everybody had their great moments, even if their parts were small. Spidey and Ant-Man nearly stole the show for me.

But the best part was the final battle. Yeah the fight sequence was cool but the acting of Downey Jr. once he finds about what Bucky did had me speechless. He deserves an Oscar nod just for that scene alone!

Can't wait to go see it again!",4i35uf

I just rewatched Winter Soldier and all Steve learned from the German doctor guy is ""accidents happen"" (and then we see images about the crash). He also learns the doctor created the Winter Soldier, but, never learns anything in the film that connects the two. Did I miss Bucky telling Steve in Civil War? This is driving me nuts.",4i35uf

The introduction to Spiderman was amazing.  Leave it to Marvel to get their character pitch perfect for the first time on screen.

* Visuals. Holy crap did everything look good, especially Black Panther's outfit. I think Spidey's suit was the weakest but not bad. 

* Story. I couldn't think of a way to have the heroes clash without it being really weird and illogical. They really set clear-cut stances of each hero that were really reasonable. Both were admirable, Cap's want for freedom and Widow's look for survival. 

* Humor. Ant-Man and Spider-Man killed it. Falcon and WS chemistry was hilarious as well. And finally, Tony's quips weren't so numerous they're insufferable. 

* Character Juggling. Impressive showing of the Russo brothers giving enough screentime to each hero and villain. I'm quite surprised how seamlessly two new characters were introduced into a jam-packed film. Way better than an email containing .mp4s

I was in a constant state of ""holy shit this is awesome"" that spiked as soon as ""Queens"" came up.

They did an amazing job building up the conflict between  Rogers and Stark and the whole anatomy of friendship. In the end I truly felt that both were in the right.

Fucking Ant Man. His character made giggle like a 10 year old hearing fart jokes. 

But the movie itself irked me too. Too many questions. Also it's didn't feel like a ""war."" More like an NFL shovefest in between plays. Like it was only part one of the thing. What did the bad guy mean when he implicates that he didn't quite fail? Was crossbone working for someone? My biggest question, isn't Capt America supposed to die?

d39pd06,"Does anyone else think the death of Peggy Carter wasn't given enough weight or screen time?  They could have really fleshed out some of what she did for S.H.I.E.L.D. or how Howard (or even Tony) knew her.

If nothing else, they could have used it to throw a little more development into Cap's character as he deals with it later in the movie, giving him some more dimension or adding gravity to his motivations with regard to his political stance on the Accords.",4i35uf
d2vczaa,"Finally, Peter Parker is done correctly in a movie.


Poor and worried about money. Worried about grades. Worried about Aunt May. Worried about his secret identity. Clearly over his head. Yet still risks it all and fights crime because it's the right thing to do.


And they did Spider-Man right too.",4i35uf
d2ur26w,"Here are my thoughts of the movie:

1. My biggest take away from this movie is damn that was a perfect superhero movie if there is one. It had everything you want in it. It did the emotional part, very organic and natural humour (not forced at all), epic fight scenes, philosophical debate, closure on certain characters, a good plot line and motivations behind each character, a ""villain"" that makes sense (although many critics don't agree with me), awesome new characters reveal and emotional impact.

2. Spiderman was perfect. He is literally the best spiderman and Peter Parker we have ever seen on screen. I was really skeptical of Tom Hollands when it was first announced. But damn I am so happy to eat my own words because god damn he was a joy to watch. Every time spidey shows up I knew I would love it. He was THAT perfect. Black Panther was equally badass. He held his own against all these ""seasoned"" superheroes. Most surprisingly was how much character development he got. He was fueled by rage and revenge at the start of the movie, but towards the end he was the most level headed character out of them all.

3. I know people don't want to compare against BvS. But this is how to make a superhero vs superhero movie. As an audience, I felt the stakes are much higher in this movie. That scene when the mother confronted Tony about Sokovia, I felt as if we know the victims personally. I understood the rage these people had for the Avengers. That was further cemented by the opening scenes where Wanda accidentally led to the death of a lot of innocent people. You can see how it internally torn Tony apart. Even with Cap, you understands why he refused to sign the accord. Even as those two were all out fighting in the airport, you can tell Tony just wants to help. I was emotionally torn between the two sides, and frankly even as I finished the movies I still couldn't decide which team I am on. I feel for all the collateral damage victims, but at the same time seeing Wanda and Clint locked up in that prison didn't feel right.

4. Maybe I missed the hints in Winter Soldier, but holy shit that twist with Bucky being the one that killed Tony's parents was shocking for me. It was hard to watch Bucky brutally murdered Tony's parents, and even harder to see Tony watching that footage. God damn that was gut-wrenchingly difficult to watch. To be honest it made me a little bit pissed off at Cap. At the same time, made that line ""So was I"" from Tony so much more heavy.

5. Vision's character was also quite interesting through this movie. You can tell he is constantly learning new things about himself, especially realising he is developing feelings for Wanda. The subtle hints about those two were nice, it didn't feel forced. It was also interesting to see Wanda's internal conflict with her powers. All this talk about people being afraid of her, but you can tell the person that is most afraid of her powers was herself. And that showed throughout the movie.

6. I know a lot of critics didn't like Zemo as the ""baddie"", but to me he made perfect sense. Driven by the death of his family, the only things he cared about, he sough to avenge (pun intended) their deaths by destorying the Avengers from within. He knew that's the only way to do it, as he said they are more powerful than he can possibly imagine. That ending scene with him and BP, and seeing him listen to the last voicemail he had from his wife, that hurts a little. You can feel his pain, and understood why he did what he did.

7. Last but not least, that scene with Cap kissing Sharon, and Falcon and Bucky sitting in the car cheering for their bro was absolutely hilarious. Easily the funniest scene in the whole movie.

9/10. It's pretty damn close to a perfect movie. Now if you would excuse me, I am gonna go watch it again.",4i35uf
d2uziyq,"Best joke? ""Oh, I thought that was a water truck.""

My best friend and I laughed so, so heatedly at that joke. Paul Rudd stole the show, along with Spidey, in his time on-screen.

I love this film. It embodies exactly what a fun, superhero movie should be. It may not be the best Marvel Studios film, but I think it's up there in the top five. 

The Russo brothers really made the audience *care* for Stark and Rodgers. There were moments where I was torn on my stance multiples times for two and a half hours.

That being said, I believe the film took a liiiiiitle while in the beginning to get kickstarted. I know not every scene can be action-packed, but some of the dialogue dragged along a bit.

Nonetheless, the film is a solid 8/10 after my first viewing.",4i35uf

d2vk2rk,"Just got back. I'm thinking it's the best superhero movie ever made.

Good, coherent story. Nice character beats. Dealt with some serious issues while still being a lot of fun. Over a dozen superheroes get some screen time, but it still didn't feel overstuffed.

Still dealing with the issue of Marvel movies generally weak villains, but it works because the bad guy is just the one who sets the plot in motion, all of the real conflict happens between heroes.",4i35uf
d2vwaa5,Would say that this was a better version of the Avenger movie's than the actual Avenger movie's.,4i35uf
d2w3n8y,"That was just relentlessly perfect. 

Despite being crammed to bursting with characters, they all got their moments to shine, they all actually related like people who know one another and don't want to be fighting. But when they fought it looked SICK.

Zemo was a phenomenal villain. So normal and unassuming, he was almost bland in appearance, but his plan was brilliant and made perfect sense. And you can't even really fault him for it! He had real reasons to want the Avengers destroyed, unlike Luthor in BvS.

All hail the Brothers Russo. At this point, their biggest worry is how the hell they are going to top themselves in Infinity War.",4i35uf
d2x6kt0,Spiderman was better in his twenty minutes of screen time than he was in the five previous Spiderman films combined.,4i35uf
d2ur6zz,"I didn't think BvS was that bad when I came out of it. Then I saw Civil War. When I left Civil War, my cheeks HURT from smiling so much. It was so freaking engaging, entertaining, and plain fun. They fit in just the perfect amount of humor, and not toooooo quippy like Age of Ultron or too forced either. Everything just tied-in and flowed so perfectly. 

They really did the relationships well too. Hey Arrow writers, want to see a truly organic relationship? Vision and Wanda. There you go. Steve and Sharon were great too, and even the guy next to me was like FINALLY. Lots of great fanservice. I wanted to cheer at half the references. 

The Empire Strikes Back reference was so amazing. Probably the funniest part. So glad Lucasfilm is under Disney's helm. Spiderman was amazing. I did not expect to love him so much. I was really iffy about such a young Spiderman but Tom Holland completely proved me wrong. He's such a little shit in the best of ways. 

I didn't know whether to laugh or cry during the big Team Iron Man v. Team Cap fight scene. It was both hilarious and just awe-inspiring. Literally amazing fight choreography. The whole movie was just beautiful fighting. 

Black. Fucking. Panther. Came out of that movie LOVING him. Holy crap. What a cool suit. He's cool AS FUCK. And sexy to boot. I loved how light he was on his feet. His claws are awesome. 

Just a goddamn great movie. Can't wait to rewatch and soak it all in again. They hit you with so much stuff and you can't believe it's all happening. This is what the MCU has been leading up to. What a great, complete Marvel movie. Thank you, Russo Bros. 

And I love Marisa Tomei as Aunt May. And Daniel Bruhl was under-utilized I feel. The stopped suicide was cool as shit tho. ",4i35uf
d2un6ye,I loved every minute of it except for the over the top shaky cam in the beginning. ,4i35uf
d2uoosn,I have to watch this again to be sure but did anyone else hear a subtle Star Wars theme play when Spider-Man asked if anyone has seen Star Wars?,4i35uf
d2ur51a,"So many jokes that didn't impede on the tone of the movie like in Avengers 2.

Funniest bit to me was Antman having Cap throw the fuel truck thinking it was a water truck. Antman seemed genuinely concerned about it.

Overall, good, personal story for the characters mixed with large scale group battles and smaller, personal fights. Good use of everyone's powers and skill sets. 

It want to see it again... ",4i35uf
d2us5t0,"Loved every minute of it. For me it was so much better than Winter Soldier, which I didn't enjoy until the second or third viewing. They got so much right here: both sides had compelling arguments for the fight, and the acting was fantastic across the board. Downey Jr., even if we know that he's a great actor, just brought it like a mofo in every scene. 

They got Spidey exactly right, even down to the quips and movements. I can't wait for his own film now. I was so worried, after so many bad films, that they'll just never get him right on screen. I was wrong. 

Loved the Black Panther, Chadwick Boseman just killed it in the role. I wish there had been more of him, since he had such a stellar presence on screen.

That airport scene has been hyped for a reason. My god man. Just perfect all around. Right down to the way they referenced older films, and brought out new powers like Giant Man. 

And how cool was it that this was the first Marvel film where the villain not only won, but had totally humane motivations to do so? After the ridiculousness of Batman V. Superman, having Zemo be an understandable, tragic villain was like a breath of fresh air, and it made the entire proceedings feel much more natural than I could have hoped for.

The Russo's really have a hang on making these films work on a really crowdpleasing level, apart from Star Wars and the first Avengers, I don't think I've heard this good an audience reaction in theaters in years.",4i35uf

Especially the ending where he spares Zemo and instead takes him to prison. I'm kind of glad at least one hero could see what he was doing. Also the credit scene where he helps Cap hide Bucky see ally sets up his movie. I'm so excited to see it!,4i35uf
d2v1bbb,"I've only seen the film once, so I might make up my mind on a second watch. A good consistent film, to be expected from Marvel. It's a lot better if you've seen everything leading up to it. If you haven't, it's still enjoyable.

Villain was all right. Quite a detachment from the comics, which isn't a bad thing, but he wasn't anything special. Above average for a Marvel movie.

I'm torn on the action. It was never bad, but there were parts that I felt were not necessarily good. The sequences that had too many quick cuts and shaky cam were pretty poorly done and felt disjointed and messy (like the scene where Bucky is escaping). Not bad, but not good either. The fight scenes at the airport and the final battle between Iron Man, Cap, and Bucky, were pretty well done, keeping it fun and exciting while being well shot. 


Spiderman and Black Panther were definitely my favourite parts of the movie. They were just so badass and likable whenever they were onscreen, and their parts of the action sequences were great.

Cinematography was average, maybe  above average. Again, typical for a Marvel film. As I said before, the action sequences where they chose to use too many quick cuts that made the movements feel very disconnected and choppy were pretty poor. On the other hand, the final battle was excellent. Throughout the film, the photography was above average.

Is it the best comic book movie? It's certainly a very consistent and good one, but I'm not sure if I'd call it the best cbm. Again, I've only seen it once. 

Is it better than Batman v Superman? Despite all their similarities, they are very different movies and are better in different ways. Civil War is definitely far more consistent with it's quality, being good the whole way through. While I personally loved BvS, I could see where it might fall flat in some people's eyes. The high points in BvS are far more epic and surpass Civil War for sure. But BvS has low points as well, while Civil War doesn't really have any. The BvS soundtrack is better for sure, as is it's cinematography. But while it looks and sounds better, it's still a less consistent movie. Civil War is also far more ""fun"" and action-packed rather than BvS which is far more dark and philosophical.",4i35uf
d2w23qn,"Lot of thoughts on this one. I had a good time and enjoyed it, a really well put together film, but also one with some flaws IMO.

**THE GOOD**

* The characters. Everybody seemed comfortable in their own skin as their characters, even the newbies. Loved the returning favorites,  even the ones with smaller roles such as Hawkeye and Vision. Black Panther was fantastic, can't wait to see Boseman get a full film to let loose. Tom Holland definitely felt like a real Spider-Man and Peter Parker to me, a real highlight.

* The action. Man, where those fights intense. Each Avenger had their own fighting style that really made sense for who they are. Cap using his tactics and advanced strength. Falcon with flying hit-and-run maneuvers. Spidey taking the long shots and swinging in for quick shots. The finale fight was intense too, just pure rage and emotion.

* The ambiguity. Not sure how everyone else felt, but I don't think either side really was right. Sure Cap wanted to prove Bucky's innocence, but he was being pretty thick headed in the way he was doing it. Tony had his heart in the right place, but let his emotions cloud him. Honestly, I felt myself sympathetic with Tony most of the movie, but I'm sure there are others who felt that way with Cap, which is great. Better than the comic which just made Stark an unlikable asshole.

**THE BAD**

* Convoluted storyline. This movie was jampacked with a lot of stuff, to a fault I think. I was able to follow along pretty well, but I'm a diehard for this stuff and know the characters quite well. My wife, who's seen all of the movies with me, just didn't buy a lot of the character motivations and how easily they were fighting. While I don't 100% agree, I do feel like some of the characters were willing to fight each other too quickly and join one side of the cause with just a throwaway reason. I know the battle was one of the big draws, and I loved it, don't get me wrong, but half the players didn't get the setup to really put the full weight into the battle as Cap, Tony, and T'Challa got.

* I loved the new Spider-Man, but I wish they had made his first appearance the airport scene. Keep a bit of mystery to him, everybody knows enough about Spidey to enjoy his appearance. I really liked the Tony/Peter intro, but honestly it felt out of place in the movie and a complete derailment from the storyline. I would've rather kept that scene for Homecoming to explain how he ended up connected with Stark.

* The villain. I understand what they were going for, and to give Steve a reason to keep going against Tony, but Zemo didn't quite do it for me. Steve and Tony were already at odds when the Sokovia Accords were first brought up, and I felt like they could've incorporated the twist reveal another way. Despite that, I did like the idea that he won by splitting them up, but as another commenter said, Steve's letter at the end pretty much seems to mean that wasn't the case, so it's a bit contradictory.


I'm still digesting, but those are my current thoughts. I enjoyed the movie, but at the moment I still feel Winter Solider was better, as a tighter story with better motivations for all involved.",4i35uf
d2w67ly,was that the Bluth stair car in the airport fight? i want to believe since the Russo's did the Arrested Development pilot,4i35uf
d2w7rjf,"This film blew away all of my expectations. To be perfectly honest, I'm a huge comic book fan and I absolutely loathed the avengers films and lost a ton of faith in the marvel cinematic universe after that stint. This movie cohesively priced together an elegant storyline, strong ensemble, and emotion without even considering the fact it's universe was beginning to pull itself apart due to previous films. All things considered though, I have to say my favorite character was Black Panther. In a single conversation with his father I felt so much warmth and respect between the two that his motives and actions felt completely justified. Almost equally impressive is the fact that he is fucking terrifying in day or night while dressed like a cat. Last thing: big props for incorporating the civil war cover into the film without making it corny or awkward. ",4i35uf

I had heard from other people on reddit that Cap dies in the comic of Civil War. And then on the way into the theatre I heard some guys say ""I think they'll bring him back."" I was kinda sad/annoyed that I knew the ending going in and had it spoiled for me. In that last fight, I started thinking maybe I misinterpreted what I heard and it was Tony they were gonna ""bring back."" Gave all the tension and stakes back. But then I was kinda expecting someone to die. I was initially like, ""well nothing changed, nothing happened."" But the dynamic is completely different now. They'll have to come together to defeat Thanos for infinity war. And they're not gonna have to use some gimmick to bring back a dead character and take all the stakes out for every movie going forward. In the end I think they made the right choice and it definitely is the best MCU movie to date.",4i35uf
d2wj9jx,"This was a fun movie. Interesting story, great performances, BUT...

...I hope for Avengers Infinity War,  the Russo Brothers hire a DP that doesn't shoot action too close and with heavy shutter speed. The first few action scenes (the intro, Bucky escaping the apartment, the cafe fight) were sloppy and very difficult to watch. I could barely see what was going on which in turn, disappointed me (The clearest fight was Vision vs. Hawkeye!).

However, the big airport brawl was for the most part, awesome. The Iron Man/Captain America fight at the end was good and tense. They redeemed the movie for me.

Tom Holland did a great job as Spider-Man. That being said, I hope we don't have yet another origin story (it's getting repetitive at this point).

All in all, a good film, but not a perfect film.

d2w3xqz,"Loved the movie.  One of the top three if not the best marvel film to date in my book.  I had reservations about whether or not the excellence of The Winter Soldier could be equaled, but a few minutes into Civil War and my mind was at ease.  It is not easy to achieve a balance in a movie with so many characters, but I think the movie did it perfectly.  No one felt shoe-horned in or neglected, every hero had their chance to shine, and shine bright they did.  

The story was just complex enough, the action sequences beautiful.  Humor was used smartly throughout and not wielded like a club as it was in Age of Ultron.

I also found the villain extremely interesting in that he was just a normal (well, non-superpowered) guy whose life was wrecked by the actions of these heroes.  When he was listening to the voicemail the first time, I didn't even catch that his wife and kid were already long dead.  It's really sad stuff.  To me, tragic and relatable villains always make for more compelling storytelling.  He worked in a way that Ultron (""I'm big bad and evil and I'm gonna do bad things"") didn't for Age of Ultron.

As far as comic book movies go, hell as entertaining movies go, it was solid as vibranium.  Easy 9/10 minimum.",4i35uf

d2un4f7,"Up until about a month ago I was extremely skeptical of Captain America: Civil War. When it was first announced, I didn’t think it was being handled with the proper respect. The end of Age of Ultron wasn’t as strong as it should have been to start bringing the seeds of distrust between Tony and Steve. I was worried. I figured the only great comic movies that came out this year might be Apocalypse and Dr. Strange. 

And then of course, then the reviews started to come out and I got a little bit excited. I got to go to the fan screening in Mid-April, and my expectations were blown out of the water. I loved it, basically the entire film. The action was great, the comedy seemed to fit better, and the stakes were high. It was a slow build, but one that had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.

Before this, The Winter Soldier was my favorite Marvel film, and I am happy that the next Captain America film was able to top it. I have so much hype for Spider-Man, for Black Panther, and for the next Avengers thanks to the Russo brothers. 

I liked it so much I went back for the press screening this week, to check it out in IMAX 3D, and yeah, it didn’t add a lot to the film, but a second viewing had me just as captivated and excited. I rarely see a movie more than once in theaters, so I am shocked that the level of excitement held up a second time.

I had a lot of thoughts on the film, so if you actually want to see specifics and minor nitpicks, you can read my [full review here :\)](http://gorgview.com/captain-america-civil-war) . But for the most part, this is definitely one of the best films of the year so far for me.

d2unld4,"Goddamn. 

Near the end I was like, ""Jesus Christ we've come a long way."" It seemed like it was soooo close from getting away from the Russo Brothers but they were always, *always*, able to bring it back, and I think that's the greatest achievement of this movie. Adding Winter Soldier as a hero, introducing Spiderman, introducing Black Panther, bringing in registration, Zemo - everything. And it *all made sense*. This is the pinnacle of a ""comic book movie"" in my opinion. Winter Soldier is a great political thriller, but this is *the* goddamn comic book movie.

That last fuckin' fight too. Goddamn. The emotion.",4i35uf

I know he's a supporting character for Black Panther, but I don't remember them having a scene together. Plus, I think Freeman is a little too famous and busy to be playing such a minor role.

Cap was right in getting Bucky away and finding out what was going on, but when they showed up at the airport he should have just handed him over. Cap *really* didn't need Bucky to go after the other super soldiers. Everything Cap did really shows how much he thinks he's beyond reproach.

d2v28t9,"I was definitely feeling Marvel fatigue going into this movie. I've really liked or at least enjoyed almost all of the MCU movies and the trailers for this movie were great but I just wasn't very hyped going into the cinema.   

After watching it I would probably rate it as my second favorite in the MCU after Guardians of the Galaxy and just ahead of Iron Man. Basically everything about the movie worked and it was a really enjoyable movie going experience.  
The story was engaging and made me care about all the characters but without being able to ever really chose a side. The comedy was still there but without relying on too many one-liners. The history between the established characters was respected and the decisions they made felt believable.   

As many other have pointed out, Black Panther and Spider Man were real high points of the movie. I had never head of Black Panther before this movie whereas Spider Man is probably the comic character that I'm the most familiar with and I loved them both.  
It's really impressive how Marvel introduced the Hulk in Avengers, after a controversial casting change, and made him the best character in that movie. In Age of Ultron they introduced Scarlet Witch and Vision who were both also high points of that movie, everyone remembers Vision picking up Thors hammer for example, and now they did it again.   

One criticism I have is aimed more at the MCU in general and that is the need for a really great bad guy. Zumo was great in this movie for what he was, an ex soldier pitting the heroes against each other, and the real story was Cap vs Iron Man. It worked well in this movie but we still haven't had a great villain yet. If they are going to keep pumping out these movies, two or more a year at this point, we really need a great villain soon or a lot of people will get bored. ",4i35uf

d2vjc7j,"Loved the movie but a few things bothered me. 

1.)  They don't know how to use Vision, He could have done a lot more during the Airport scene but was absent for too much of it.  He's too powerful to ignore and could have pretty much ended things rather quickly.  The problems of having a character too powerful for the screen. [unless of course they used Scarlet Witch to control him]  -  Same goes for her, that airport scene could have and should have been over if she wished it. 

2.) Scarlet Witch wouldn't stay put in the house but she'd just allow them to jail her in the under water prison?  

3.)  Thought there would be higher stakes at the end but the letter to Stark sort of muted that.

d2vs1b0,"I was hooked from the start, and the film was a 10/10 for me all the way through, but I kept waiting for the WHAM! moment where we felt some true loss or danger in this conflict. I thought we were getting it when Rhodey hit the ground like a meteor. But he ultimately is on the way to recovery, albeit with some cybernetic aid, and it feels like everything both sides did has amounted to a zero sum.

I spent an hour trying to figure out what was missing- what was the big conflict that was missing?

When Cap and Tony fight in Siberia, the final blow Cap makes in Tony's chest looks frighteningly like a killing blow, but you know it won't be because Captain America is who he is. What would have made that final battle much more frightening and ultimately would speak volumes of both characters, is if Tony had managed to kill Bucky.

It would have shown us that Tony can be pushed across that line, but even when Cap loses something just as dear, he won't sacrifice his morals. This is a distinction between the two that I don't think the movies support enough.

Tony and Steve may never be friends again because of it, or at least they would have much deeper-planted seeds of resentment both ways. But I think we would have seen some more ideological differences between the two than the political issues of the Sokovia Accords.",4i35uf

One more point I want to make is that I get bored with fight scenes really easily. Even in Daredevil, which I LOVE, I'm always like ""oh they're doing this again"" and zone out or check my phone. I don't know how long that airport fight scene was but I didn't want it to end. Part of that was definitely that the stakes were higher and there were no real ""bad guys"" to root against but besides that it was INTERESTING. Hawkeye distracting Tony while Wanda brought down all the cars was a cool fucking shot. The Spiderman humor was perfection. Black Widow checking with Hawkeye to make sure they were still cool was so THEM. I'm forgetting some things but it was all these little moments that blew me away.

d2uwbuc,"This will probably be heavily downvoted but whatever - at least read the whole comment before doing it.

This really felt like a placeholder movie to me. It was way too convoluted to get any real sense of conflict until the final act, and the pacing really suffered as a result. Outside of Black Panther (who was great) and Cap, they failed to sell me on the characters' motivation. They should have revealed that Bucky killed the Starks much earlier and centered the movie around Cap protecting him against Tony and Black Panther, FORCING the secondary characters to choose sides or watch their friends literally kill each other. That way Tony's driving force is rage-filled revenge, instead of a grieving mother and a 5 minute conversation about oversight. RDJ is at his absolute best when his character is on the raggedy edge and emotional. What they wrote instead about Stark suddenly bending over for the UN was out of character, and wasn't enough to launch any believable conflict between the characters.

Between all the mid-fight jokes, pulled punches, and ""still friends?"" lines, it felt like even the characters knew they were only pretend-fighting.  

All told, I knew going in that it was going to be tough to make a good film with SOOO many characters and the added pressure of introducing Spider-man and BP, but they did an OK job. I thought Daniel Brühl was great as usual (after Inglorious Basterds, Rush, and the Fifth Estate I think he's one of the most underrated actors around) even if his plan was pretty far-fetched, and the last 20 minutes were fantastic. The final scene with Cap and Tony was one of the best scenes in the whole franchise.

I loved how he had no idea what he was fighting for, and for a little bit, I was wondering if Cap would explain the situation and cause him to switch sides. Black Panther's revelation about vengeance was amazing. He was so focused on vengeance that it blinded him, which really bothered me for a while.

The Civil War comic was so great because of hero's actually dying and the implications of their deaths on the other hero's. I just think Marvel could've made this work on the big screen but shied away for fear of making the movie too serious. Spiderman was played to perfection, this new kid is gonna do amazingly well. Scott Lang was hilarious yet again, The Vision-Scarlet Witch side arc was great, And the whole Tony's parents part was absolutely amazing. The setup was in the entire film for that last fight to happen but I didn't expect it to actually happen. The twist of killing the other soldiers at the end was great.

I have a question: the movie was called *Captain America: Civil War*, but I got the impression that it was really a pseudo *Avengers* film. I'm all for that, but is that doing a disservice to Cap? Even though I walked away thinking he had great character moments, I'm sort of thinking it wasn't *his* movie. Am I wrong? I plan on seeing it again, and I may have the wrong impression. A *lot* is going on in this movie (a testimony to how well crafted it is that it's not a complete mess) so it could simply be that I was too excited seeing Spider-Man take on Winter Soldier and War Machine.

If there was one thing I didn't like about this movie, it had to be the length. But that is just a minor minor minor gripe. I'd like to see this movie alone without cheering crowds, but I don't think the theater will be empty for this one any time soon.

d2vrilp,"One thing I didn't get.. When Cap and Bucky go to get Zemo at the Winter Solider place, how did Zemo know Falcon would tell Tony where the two went? 

His whole plan was based on having Cap and Bucky fight Tony at this hideout, along with Tony seeing the video of Bucky kill his parents.  But how did he know Tony would come there? He didn't know where Cap went until Falcon told him",4i35uf

d2vz4wy,"One thing I was confused by was the scene where Bucky talks about the other super soldiers, and they all go crazy, then Bucky and that one guy escape from there. So if the soldiers got too far out of hand, how were they able to get them frozen again? ",4i35uf
d2w0dee,"Someone help me understand something. In the final fight between Bucky and Cap vs Tony, when cap was walloping on Tony, what did Tony say/do right before he said ""okay,let's kick his ass"" and unleashed one of the most brutal combos ever?

 Also taking into account their combat abilities in this move alone, how do you think a SOLO fight between cap and iron man would go?",4i35uf
d2w23jn,Maybe this is just my quick-hit reaction but I didn't really like how the crux of the big fight was Cap and Bucky just deciding that Tony wouldn't believe their story so they just fought them instead. Other than that I thought it was a great movie; I still don't know whose side I am on,4i35uf
d2w4t5g,"This was by far my favourite Marvel film to date. The story-line and action had me interested for every minute of it. You know the movie is good when both sides have good points. 

The development of all the characters were great and it gave a sense of why everyone was in the fight. Black Panther was incredible and this movie made me more interested in his solo movie. This was the best Spiderman/Parker so far. Loved how he kept making comments throughout the fight annoying the opposition.

d2w4toq,"There was SOOOO much fan service in this movie. It was fucking awesome. 

The stairwell action scene and the Airport scene is fantastic choreography- the humor, the fisticuffs, and the fighting AND special effects were a spectacle to behold. This is probably going to be one of my favorite Marvel movies ever.",4i35uf

d2wghui,So What is the future for Iron Man? Cap's note made it seem like Iron Man is kinda done with the Avengers at the moment but would be accepted back if he decided. Is that about right?,4i35uf
d2wpkgm,"I loved this film. Of course, it wasn't flawless, and I'm sure that part of my love for it stems from my pre-existing knowledge of characters and events from the marvel universe. If that weren't present, then I probably wouldn't have been able to appreciate black panther, spiderman, or zemo as much. 

That being said, I was blown away by the sophistication with which they handled the conflicts. The scene in which the group debates the accord went far beyond my expectations or what you normally get in superhero movies. At one point, Cap argues that the accord shouldn't be signed because it removes the avengers' ability to be responsible for their own actions, and that's a pretty nuanced point for a superhero movie, and I loved that the debate didn't devolve to ""the greater good"" vs ""duty"". Further, the movie itself doesn't take a side, it appreciates the ambiguity and complexity of the issue. You can understand both sides, and at various points of the movie, I found myself shifting sides. Further, the avengers are held to task - we see them in a different light through Zemo, and the movie leaves us with that.

Further, I thought the movie added some substance to the characters and their relationships to one another. Stark's character arch, along with Widow visiting Cap at the funeral are great examples of this. 

Lastly, this movie seemed to move the characters forward in a pretty significant way. Plot-wise, not a whole lot happens, but by the end of it we see a real transformation not only of the relationships between the characters, but of our own view of the Avengers. Black Panther moving beyond the vengeance-driven actions that seemed to dominate so much of the first two phases of the MCU was a brilliant move that added some real depth to the franchise. I hope they don't just throw that away going forward.

1) Why didn't Cap's shield cutting Tony's arc-reactor cause Tony to die (the shrapnel would be pulled into his heart without the reactor constantly keeping it at bay).  Or why doesn't it just explode, it being  main fusion power source and all?

2) I didn't get how Iron Man found that hidden reserve of power during the final fight with Cap.  He was getting beat pretty bad, then talks to Jarvis, and says, ""let's kick his ass"".  I think I missed something here.

Anyone help? Thanks!  Great movie btw, (2nd to Winder soldier but ahead of Cap 1).",4i35uf
d2wy75s,"Solid movie. They lost Vision for 90% of the fight for some reason. The story seemed to struggle with explaining why Cap and Iron Man would be at odds over this bill (seeing as how Cap damn near signed the thing anyway). I like that they took the effort to show collateral damage and didn't really tiptoe around showing some of the rougher scenes. 

Rudd killed it. Spidey's relationship with Aunt May needs to be better defined, but Parker on his own was good. 

Lots of the things Cap did was glossed over in the quest for truth and friendship, same with Widow now that I think about it. Either way the Russo's killed it. Action was good, story wasn't stupid or erratically paced. Everything I hoped Avengers 2 would be.",4i35uf

d2x58aa,"Great movie, but one thing that always bother me in comics is the obvious difference of power levels in these fights. I try not to think about it, but when they were rushing at each other the thought just kept on creeping on. Like, why didn't Wanda just forcefully subdue everyone rather than just flinging people? I wanted her to at least do something that she can obviously do like when she forcefully smashed Vision to the depths of hell when she wanted to escape. 

Obvious answer is that it wouldn't make a fun spectacle to watch of course (hence no Hulk or Thor I believe), but super hero crossovers like the Avengers or Justice League bothers me to the next level. It would seem each hero and their respective enemies were created with their own power level structure so mixing them up causes all these incongruities and plot armor just to save face for these weaker heroes. How do you guys not let it bother you?

Lucky guess because Bucky worked for Hydra and Hydra assassinated the Starks?",4i35uf
d2x6qiu,"So I just had 2 questions, how did Cap know about Bucky and Tony's parents?

As people said, that Zemo guy is not extraordinary, he's a guy, with a plan and a patience, and I think I said it wrong, but that is the power line from the entire movie.  
And that thing with crumbling shit from the inside.  
Also, I kinda hated the ending and how Stark forgave Cap with putting that Nick Furry wannabe on hold, but hay, it's Infinity wars soon, and Hulk used his trump card in the first Avengers so he can't come to make peace with these guys.",4i35uf

For a 'superhero comic book' movie it was clever and thought provoking and felt real - in the sense that just like most things in life it's a lot of shades of grey and everyone has motivations for their actions.

I really wanted them to actually kill a main character, so we see that they aren't immune. No main character has been killed in marvel cinematic universe iirc (that lasted more than one movie).

d2utgxg,"The movie was pretty entertaining and there were plenty of great moments but honestly nothing ever clicked for me and I was just disappointed by it as a whole.

I wasn't a fan of how much of the action was filmed during the opening scenes. Too much shaky cam, too many quick cuts, and it was all way too up close. The hand to hand was phenomenal but the way things were sped up in post made it look very unnatural. Adding to that, many of the CGI components during the first half just didn't seem quite right and I was getting a bit of and uncanny valley feeling. Things looked very good but were too weightless and Black Panther was probably the biggest victim of this. The airport sequence and everything after was incredible though.

I loved Spider-Man and Black Panther. I thought they were very well done however I felt their inclusion ultimately detracts from the film. It's kind of tough for me to stay that because I thought they were handled incredibly well but it just felt so extraneous and at times as if it's being done just to introduce them. Civil War is a too overstuffed, trying to tell too many stories in rapid succession without doing enough with most of them. Black Panther has a strong introduction then quickly takes a back seat without getting much development or attention until the end of the film, just popping up from time to time trying to kill Bucky in-between.

Things move so fast that it's almost easy to miss how character arcs were getting cut off halfway through, leaving them entirely too underdeveloped. Also the characterizations of Steve, Tony, and Natasha never sat right with me. I found it very hard to believe that these characters would have acted the way they did. I genuinely don't believe that Natasha would have sided with Tony and I don't believe for one second that she'd have come to blows against Clint over it. There's such an utter failure of communication that it took me out of the movie. There simply wasn't a strong enough reason for Steve and Tony to be fighting against each other to such an extreme for most of the movie.

I feel like almost any individual scene or moment works really well on it's own but the movie is much less than the sum of its parts. The reasons and motivations behind everything that ties it all together just feels so artificially constructed and manufactured. The resolution is so disappointing too. You have the big epic fight between Steve and Tony that cements their divide. Then it's immediately like ""Yeah we have different views, sorry Tony, but you can still call me if you need me."" and the poor execution of it (all tell no show) takes away any sense of completion to it. I feel like the film should have ended after their fight and Tony reading Steve's letter should have been a post-credit scene.

Speaking of post credit scenes, the fact that Steve goes through all this trouble to protect and get back Bucky and then they literally just freeze him up again is so genuinely upsetting. It makes the entire movie feel like it was all for nothing. Honestly the end result of the film was just several steps back I thought.

Now I've complained a lot (and I could complain more) but I still enjoyed this movie very much.

The movie worked best when the narrative had a narrower focus. Whenever it ditched the extraneous elements I thought it was terrific and the scenes with Steve, Sam, and Bucky really had me engaged. The chemistry between them was terrific and I loved how they interacted. The humor was strong, though some of it didn't land with me, and it got laughs throughout.

The airport action scene was great and I though the film was very well directed (though I still find the Russo's visuals to be somewhat bland, sorry done complaining now). The cast gave great performances and I loved every scene between Wanda and Vision.

The tone was terrific but...(sorry, last time, I promise!) I wish the opening had been a bit more lighthearted and fun if only to better contrast how serious things would be getting. Instead it starts on a kind of dreary note and just gets drearier. I absolutely loved Spider-Man and I really think they nailed the character. I wish we'd seen more of Marisa Tomei! Black Panther's role isn't as big as I'd like but I loved his characterization and he had some of the best dialogue in the film. Their take on Zemo was unexpected and entirely brilliant. I loved it.

Overall I'll give the movie a 7. I don't believe it's the best Marvel has to offer but it's easily an entertaining movie and a good time. I'll definitely be seeing it again so that I can see if it plays better a second time.",4i35uf

d2vjbfh,"Just came from an early showing. As a DC fan I have to say, this is one of the better superhero flicks i've seen. Animated or Live-action. I guess it does take a little viewing of the previous flicks to really feel every line but to a casual viewer there is the right blend of pacing, action, comedy and drama that makes nearly a three hour movie seem not long enough.

Favorite scene by far is the Airport scene.

Love the way Spider-Man is introduced. I don't know how I'm supposed to feel about Aunt May hitting on Stark, but hey new directions and such.

Each character is given ample enough screen time (and quips!) so nobody feels left out or underused.

This is a definite re-watch, i'll probably see it tomorrow.

Marvel continues to knock it out of the park. Mid and End-Credits scenes satiable enough. I still think however the next films won't garner as much hype and now we're just waiting until Infinity Wars. 

overall 9/10.",4i35uf
d2vkq3w,"This might be an unpopular opinion, but did anyone else feel like it was super difficult to understand Cap's point of view? When reading the comics, it was really easy to empathize with both sides of the issue. In this movie, I honestly felt like Captain America was portrayed as a hero who placed Bucky over the lives of countless people. Like, I never even felt like he came close to expressing remorse for their actions. Obviously a comic book can dive deeper into motivations and such, but it seems like this movie kind of gave up on the real crux of the Civil War storyline to fit more fight sequences in.

tl;dr Cap seemed like an asshole and comic books are cool.",4i35uf
d2vnzve,"The entire airport fight scene alone was worth the price of admission. Down to it, the fight scenes were really awesome and pretty creative. One thing I enjoy about the Russo's direction is the impact of Bucky's and Steve's punches. Bucky literally picked up a swat guy - packing 300 pounds max - and slammed him into a wall like a stuffed animal. Then he picks up the battery ram with his metal arm. The creative usage of Captain's shield is the best by far, too.

The villain was also amazing. I was expecting up until the final fight on who the villain was going to be, besides Zemo, or if Zemo was going to dawn his suit, but nope, he was just a regular joe in this movie. I like that because in the previous Marvel movies, it's always been a supervillain that couldn't conquer the heroes, but Zemo (pre-villain) was able to bring them down on his own.

I did not expect the Spider-Man scene where Tony visits Parker in his home. Obviously I knew he was in the movie, but that small, but vital scene was so awesome and hilarious and a good start to Peter and Tony's friendship. Holland nailed Spider-Man more than I expected. Marvel did good. Yes, Tony, Aunt May is hot.

Which also reminds me, Tony asked if there were anybody else with ""Fantastic"" powers...makes me only hope for Marvel to acquire Fantastic 4.

Ant-Man turning into a giant was awesome and hilarious, especially the ""OH SHIT"" Spider-Man said. The entire Avengers cast, despite the limited screen time, were all given equal screen time and were given really awesome scenes - especially Ant-Man! 

The movie never felt long, it was funny at funny moments, it was emotional during emotional scenes, it was greatly well balanced than Age of Ultron. When the reviews came in saying this was the best Marvel movie to date, they weren't kidding. I enjoyed this a lot!

d2vzt6d,"This is definitely one of the best Marvel movies to date. And I know I'm going to get hated on for saying this, but I was still disappointed. It felt dragged out, like an overly long wrap-up series of so many plot threads and character arcs that the whole thing stretched over a brilliant shiny MCU skeleton while I checked my watch three or four times during the screening.

I was mostly bored during this movie; I found myself fidgeting in my seat. It had some great moments, no doubt. I really enjoyed the final scenes of the film and the fight between Cap, Bucky, and Stark. There was a split second where it felt like Cap was going to smash Stark's face in with his shield. You know he never would, but the fact that they made it feel that way was just great. The twist at the end with the villain was pretty good, by ""twist"" standards. The buddy-trio scenes with Bucky, the wings guy (I forget his name), and Cap were also good fun. Black Panther was executed well. Overall the huge mess of characters were handled well and it could have been much worse. But they still weighed down the film.

Unfortunately, much of the movie dragged. Why was Spider-Man introduced? What was the point of that? A lot of the dialogue felt like it lacked weight - just going through the motions. We see Cap's love letter to Tony at the end to let us know everything is hunky-dory again, negating the villain's last line of dialogue. All the scenes that moved the plot forward to get the Avengers to the places they needed to be for the final battle to trigger felt unnecessarily convoluted. They even had to play the opening scene *three times in total* for it to make sense.

I'm sorry guys, but I think I have comic book film fatigue.",4i35uf
d2uow7q,"Are we sure this movie is in Phase 3? Because Bucky got that 'ol Phase 2 disarmament treatment...

^^^^^^^^^/s",4i35uf
d2uq18e,"Bravo. Bravo. I mean it. This was a goood movie, and if it weren't for nostalgia for the first Avengers film, this would be one of the top ones easily. Steps it up in every way from the Winter Soldier, and is an excellent sequel to Avengers: Age of Ultron.

Are there plot holes? If you think about it yes. But the feel. The action. The characters. The visuals. The fan service. All of it, helps make the movie flow so well, and the humour just ties it all together.

So many fan service little things - Sharon Carter's eulogy speech is a [direct quote from CA himself.](http://www.ldssmile.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3779149-no+you+move+cap+says.jpg). Shots are straight up lifted from the Civil War pages. Characters are treated with so much respect and admiration here.

Spider-Man is just outstanding. Tom Holland nails both Peter Parker and Spider-Man, and just oozing with fun. Black Panther just looks incredible and I can't wait to see him again. Man did I love watching Falcon in action with all his new moves and toys, making them feel so distinct from the Iron Man and War Machine suits. Giant Man! Ant Man flying Hawkeye's arrow! Vision being oh so awkward and adorable.

But seriously every single character steals scene after scene after scene. Action scenes galore, the Germany Airport sequence being the pinnacle of the film. I wish though that the trailers didn't show the fight snippets of the final act (the Siberia fight) because you could figure out how the ending would play.

RDJ. Man oh man. I can't see MCU without him and has one of the deepest character arcs I've seen, and played excellently opposed to Chris Evans. Again, acting is just spot-on and makes the movie feel SOOO good.

Story is pretty damn good, Zemo is a change up but very compelling honestly in both motives and how he acts. Slightly disappointed Crossbones was killed off so early. 

Oh and the humour. I cannot stop talking about the humour. Well timed, well paced, Spider-Man's a hoot, the Bucky and Falcon duo is just too much (there is going to be .gif as soon as this movie comes out right after CA gets some action and both Bucky and Falcon smiling at him like ""Niiiiice"" - that's what best friends are for!). It just makes the film and helps the movie flow so well. 

There was no contest. Civil War thoroughly beats Batman vs Superman hands down. ",4i35uf
d2uql1h,"Definitely one of the top 3 comic book films of all time.  For as much as it had going on every second was purposeful and no line of dialogue seemed to go to waste.

d2w4rag,"This film was a real treat! Here are my highlights:

1) I really loved Black Panther in this film. I wasn't sure exactly how his character would be used but I was pleasantly surprised to see he had quite a big role. Can't wait to see what they come up with for his standalone film.

2) Tom Holland nailed it as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Although he only had a tiny bit of screen time I loved every moment he was onscreen. I caught myself with a dumb smile on my face at almost every line of dialogue during the airport fight scene. 

3) Baron Zemo really surprised me. His sympathetic backstory really hit home that he is another victim of the collateral damage from the Avenger's battles; and another consequence of their actions. 

4) Every character was written extremely well. You can understand everyone's reasoning for choosing the sides that they are on. Iron Man haunted by his mistakes. Captain refusing to letting others tell him how to respond to injustice. T'Challa's revenge for his dead father. Bucky's redemption an repentance for his actions while under control of Hydra. Zemo's revenge for his family etc. etc. Everyone had legitimate reasoning for their actions. 

5) Giant-Man. The Giant Man scene stole the show for me, it was super cool! And Ant-Man in general was great to see interacting with the other Avengers. 

Absolutely loved this movie! My favourite Marvel movie to this day hands down! Can't wait for Doctor Strange!",4i35uf

Now, the fights were cool and all the different super heroes were used well and made an impression, but I feel like the other 80-90% of the movie that was dialogue was pretty... boring. The plot also felt like not much actually happened, and in terms of levels of villain the villain of Civil War felt... lacking.

It was certainly better than BvS, though. I'll give it that.",4i35uf

Superman, you actually care about these characters and what they were fighting for made total sense. And I am pretty excited for Caps underground Avengers team!",4i35uf
d2uxhoh,"Watched the movie today. It is a superhero vs movie done right:

- filmmakers really understand the heroes' powers/limitations and find interesting ways for the heroes to use those powers; e.g. things Bucky did with his metal arm, Falcon using his wings as shields, Cap pulling a helicopter, BP's martial art moves etc. The list goes on. It is amazing and it is fun to watch.

- Character introductions flow very well. We got two ""new"" heroes and the movie doesn't drag because of it.

- Filmmakers make Ironman more sympathetic and Cap less righteous. It is a good adjustment.

- Actual, permanent character development. Team split up, relationships changed and characters' allegiances shifted. The heroes are not the same after the event of this movie, and it is good. 

Here are my responses to some of the points other people made on this thread:

- Zemo is weak/no super villain fight: introducing one-dimensional villains at the last minute would weaken the movie. The third act should be Ironman vs Cap/WS and taking screen time from that would be a bad direction. Having a human villain makes sense because human vs supers is a central theme of the movie.

- no tension/stake because Nobody gets hurt or die: That is just superhero movies in general though. Major superheros won't die or stay dead on screen and that is how it is. Comics have permanent hero deaths but comics also have retcons/reboots/alternative universes. I see it as an issue with the genre as a whole and it probably requires some suspense of disbelief. 

- motivation always has something to do with parents' murder: it is getting cliche at this point but at least Civil War does it in a more convincing way. No multiple flashbacks of the same shots; foreshadowing and a final reveal. It also helps a lot that WS is directly responsible for Tony's murder. 

Lastly, I just want to list things I found bad in comparison from the other movie from the other studio:

- dragonballz style fighting with superheros is boring. Super saiyans have powerups/fancy moves at least...

- lazy character introductions and adaptions. Make those scenes fit within the movie please.

- setting up the main villain to be a plot device and then allowing the villain to take up too much screen time. If the villain is going to be one-dimensional, may as well spend screen time on events/interactions the audience cares about.

- throwing in a super villain at the last minute while the movie is about good guy vs good guy. 

- don't bother to explain or justify characters' moral grounds. Instead of tossing around some metaphors or references, just have the characters argue each other on screen. ",4i35uf
d2uz1cl,"Probably my favourite villain Marvel have ever done. He was toned down and realistic, which I loved. Going in I thought we were going to get a super hammy, purple sock wearing quipper ala Red Skull but what we got was do much better. Going into the climax I thought we were going to see the typical villain plan, of him wanting to use the supersoldiers to create an army to take over the world. Instead they went the complete opposite route, which blew me away. 

I hate picking on BvS, because hell its gotten its fair share of criticism, but fuck this is everything it should have been.",4i35uf
d2v4w43,I was always wondering where Vision was in this movie. Where was Vision in the first mission w/ Crossbones? Why is he in the kitchen making food? He felt less involved than Spider-man. ,4i35uf

""Hey guy, let's beat the fuck out of each other and see what happens. Cool, now that that's out of the way you go your way, and I'll go mine. Oh but yeah, if you need me, call. That's cool too.""

They also managed to glue a few pieces together at the end. This is why you need to build the universe before building frenemies WB!

Oh, and the only issue I had with the movie was how they handled Wanda/Vision's powers. I understand why the Russos had to juice them down a bit, but as a comic book nerd, it was a bit too obvious for me. But kudos for showing their relationship kindling....so it equals out. ",4i35uf
d2waig6,"Did anyone else find the main fight scene almost out of place?

Yeah it was funny, but it felt like they weren't really angry with each other. Compared with rest of the movie which was all very serious.
",4i35uf
d2wd3x9,"So, a couple of things. Did anyone see how casually Spidey handled both the Winter Soldier and the Falcon. He caught their punches easily and nearly disabled the Captain as well. He lost out mostly cause he's a kid and the others had experience fighting together (also gimmicks). 

I'm not super comic book savvy, but are they setting up a 15 year old kid as potentially more powerful than 90% of the Avengers? That's a brave decision!

Is this the same Baron Zemo from the Thunderbolts comic? He seemed a bit different. Definitely the best villain Marvel has done yet. So very human and relatable.

Also, does anyone else feel the musical score was a bit too ... formulaic? I can't recall any of the themes to be honest. That is the one department that I feel BvS: Dawn of Justice is ahead in - the Junkie XL + Hans Zimmer duo was a bit too good.",4i35uf

d2uu9f0,[deleted],4i35uf
d2vd6xw,"Just want to get it out the way, I have my issues with the MCU. We all do! Mine include the fact that some films feel very filler and less stand alone (Thor movies, The Dark World in particular seem to be very cookie cutter with the redeeming feature being it's connection in the overall narrative), the consistent humour which whilst funny have massive impacts on the tone in a negative way (the biggest example being Age of Ultron), and to me the biggest is that many of the films never seem to have an individual, ""auteristic"" identity. Visually they aren't really that special and I feel the cheap hired writers and directors often lead to a very basic and safe way of filmmaking. This is why none of the films are bad per say, but some leave a lot to be desired.

Anyway, with all that said, Civil War is the best of the bunch. I have major issues which I will talk about later on, but for now I just want to say that the maturity and emotion this film evokes really shows the potential and long term quality of a well done cinematic universe. We've seen these characters grow on screen and their opinions come off so well, in fact that boardroom scene with the reveal of the Accords is my favourite in the whole franchise. FINALLY consequences are given to these heroes. I mean sure I would have liked the incident that kicked everything off to be more than just a bloody corner of the building going off (but I guess that shows just how highly they regard life), but ah well. The shot of the cam footage of Hulk killing someone by climbing the building was so unexpected but so good (although no fucking way did only 72 people die in New York. At least give us a realistic number for fuck sake, at least in the bloody thousands at a minimum). The drama in this scene was just perfect and like I said, through the personalities we've known over the past 8 years we see their opinions come across perfectly and both sides of view are given equal weight and appreciation. Then they made me bring the waterworks with the funeral. Seriously at this point it had potential to be my favourite film of all time and I was loving how mature Marvel finally made their movies.

And then it started going a bit downhill. The first half of the film was so solid with rare but strong humour when needed but on the whole we had a response to actions in previous films which if anything raised the quality of those movies (I find it funny how the scene completely ignored earth nearly being destroyed in The Dark World, even the government want to forget that movie). But then I don't know what happened, they just lost their way and i'd say after the Black Panther/Winter Soldier/Captain America chase, the movie started losing it's way. The airport fight gets so much acclaim, but honestly I was disappointed. They completely abandoned the stakes for ha ha moments. Seriously it felt like they were having a playground game rather than anything with stakes and tension. It was a major issue and it was like Marvel/Disney couldn't help themselves and for some reason decided to include humour. Sure it got the audience laughing, but fucking hell just stick with a tone properly and don't just fall back into old formulaic habits. Please. Especially with how emotional the movie is. I loved Spider-Man and Ant-Man, but there was just too much comic relief. My big issues include the way Bucky changes. The movie made him far too relaxed here, and it was disappointing because I think he needed another movie of not being himself. Instead we see him and Sam be chummy and joke about (""I hate you"") which are once again funny but unnecessary, and the biggest is the kiss where the two nod at Steve. I loved it, it was brilliant, but character wise it was far too soon and didn't make sense for the character at that present time in my opinion.

Also, Spider-Man should NOT have been there. I absolutely loved him, every scene he was in and so on, but narratively it makes absolutely no sense, and contradicts everything the narrative did so well about Tony Stark. So his main reasoning for going with the Accords is a death of a mother's kid in Sokovia. Perfect. So what does he do...he fucking hires a kid to be a pawn in his game. He puts a kid's life in danger, and considering he gets thrown around a lot and nearly gets stepped on by Giant-Man, it just made no sense. It was as bad as Batman realizing he's becoming his parents murderer in Batman v Superman only for them to throw that out the window the next scene by killing thugs. It was a real shame to be honest. I just wish he was brought in through a better way than having Tony be a fucking cunt about it, especially after meeting Aunt May and seeing how much she cared about him. I don't care if he only told him to web people, he exploited a kid and put his life in danger, there is no excusing it.

Oh also, I really hated that ""have you guys seen that OLD MOVIE, Empire Strikes Back"". Talk about cringe. Firstly, it tries to be very ""Oh the silly youth of today"" and making him out to not have respect for old stuff and to show how young he is. Except, Peter would obviously be a big Star Wars fan and would never say ""hey guys have you seen this old movie"". It just sounds really cheap. That's all they had to do was be ""hey guys, any of you seen Empire Strikes Back"" and that would have been enough. It fits the character, isn't used to be like ""Oh god he's so young"" (especially since no one speaks like that, especially someone like Peter), and ultimately feels way more natural.

The villain I was fine with. I liked how he wasn't even a big threat, he literally just made the heroes fight out of revenge because he knew that was all he could do. The best part about this is that the tension and focus is solely on the main characters. This is vital after say Batman v Superman made Lex set up far too much of their conflict when it should have been mostly them with as much Lex influence as Zemo had here. Black Panther was handled perfectly especially his scene with Zemo. Like I said before, this film is just dripping with emotion.

To sum up, I really enjoyed Civil War. I grew up on DC stuff other than Spider-Man and I loved Batman v Superman, but Civil War had everything that I wanted from that movie that I didn't get. I feel both Marvel and DC could learn a lot from each other, with DC needing to know how to handle characters and the human moments (interactions like Black Widow hugging Steve or the light hearted Ultron hammer scene), but Marvel seriously need to know when to not use humour, because whilst in the moment it's good, in the long run it really lowers the quality and weight of the movie when the go to end of a scenario is a joke moment rather than continuing with the strong tone when it needs to.

TL;DR: Best movie in the MCU yet, but overall it got held back by a poor narrative reason for Spider-Man joining which lowers the credibility of Stark/contradicts his character, and Marvel need to stop being afraid of maintaining a serious tone because it continues to ruin what should be tense and dramatic moments.

edit: thanks for the discussion and the replies regarding Tony's Spidey decision, it's great reading the opinions and how it can positively effect my own. Way better discussion here than with the /r/marvelstudios sub which of course wasn't as happy for criticism but hey ho.",4i35uf

Otherwise, decent acting from everyone and interesting to see how the heroes reacted to fighting each other. Nice biceps on Captain America pulling the helicopter down as well! ",4i35uf

He had no clear motivation, unless I missed something relating to his relationship with Cap? Why would he side with him?

I also disliked when he tried talking shit to Tony about being in jail. He made it sound like Wanda wasn't a criminal until this new law.

There was speculation that she was going somehow related to Black Panther/Wakanda but her scenes were left out of AoU.",4i35uf
d2x7tou,"Loved the movie, but as this is the internet, there has to be things to nitpick about, which I'm listing below in hopes people will provide logical explanations for it:

- Why did Stark decide to recruit a teenage kid into the fight? When he showed up at Parker's apartment, he made it sound like he was going to be vital in capturing Cap...but why? Best I can think of was that his webbing was strong? Still seems extremely dangerous to bring a kid into that fight. 

-Also when did Stark have time to make him a new suit? Seemed like he must have had it designed and manufactured in a matter of hours.

-This was a disagreement I had with my friends- was Crossbones hired by Zemo to do what he did; or was it a completely unrelated event?

-Was it really explained what the Sokovia Accords entailed? If they were, did T'Challa ever actually sign them? If so, does it mean by the end he had switched sides, since he was helping Cap/Bucky? And shouldn't Natasha have been immediately arrested when she betrayed the team? I know Stark told her that she would be hunted...but he still let her go, even though her actions led to Rhodey being in the situation where he got shot down. And did Spider-man sign the accords, he would have had to in order to be sent on that mission right? Since Stark went rogue and followed Cap, how was he not in trouble? They had to have filled the people in charge in about it, since they came back with Zemo in custody. 

-Where did the recording of Bucky killing Stark's parents even come from? It looked like they were driving down a road through the woods, which would mean there was a camera on some random tree? And Bucky shot the camera, but somehow Hydra got a hold of it? How did Cap know about it beforehand?

-For some reason, it annoyed me that Cap was able to just break into the Raft to free his friends...I mean its a prison under the ocean that seems to only come up when they are allowing someone with proper clearance to get in, yet somehow Rogers was able to get in. 

-Zemo seemed to have a very complicated plan, but was it all just to get a video of Bucky murdering the Stark's? Seemed like a lot of work, especially since he couldn't have known if Stark, Rogers, or anyone at all would show up?

I know I listed a bunch of things, but again all of these are really just minor gripes, and didn't take away from me really enjoying the movie. 
",4i35uf
d2xa704,"A few Gripes...Crossbones.  He shows up and dies, no explanation for the biological virus he was after, or who he was trying to give it too.  Vision needs to watch every soap opera and observe more human interaction so he doesn't become more overly creepy than he was in this movie.  Ms. Carter seemed waaay too eager to help Captain America with regards to helping him find Bucky.  The final scene didn't include at least a montage of Captain America infiltrating/kicking ass at the Raft prison.  Also not once did they call Zemo ""Baron"".  Positives...Spiderman, Black Panther, Ant-Man, Vision, Falcon, War Machine, Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, and Winter Soldier all in the same shot on-screen nuff said cause it was frickin amazing.  Ready for both Spiderman and Black Panther movies.  Hope Black Panther sparing Zemo comes back to bite him in the ass.  Zemo seems very persuasive and he had helpers.  Seems Tony Stark is being set up to become a literal father figure to Peter Parker with Aunt May being so hot.  Tony Starks emotional realization watching THAT video file helped turning the last fight of the movie into something so emotionally brutal.  Totally will go see this movie for a 3rd screening.",4i35uf

d2xj1zc,"Joe and Anthony Russo did a very fine job directing this film. Thus far in the MCU, their track record is two out of two critically-praised films (the other being “The Winter Soldier”), with both Infinity War films arriving on the horizon, which they will be directing as well. With an abundance of firmly-choreographed action sequences, compelling protagonistic/antagonistic characterization, and sympathetic story elements that keep the normal MCU mood relevant, this was a superb film that can be described with essentially every synonym to “a masterpiece”. I am very psyched to witness what the Russo brothers will bring to the fans with the Infinity War films. 9.5/10 is my final rating, as no film is perfect.",4i35uf
d2xpdbe,"It was absolutely marvelous! I enjoyed every moment and glad to live in a time where comic books come to life on the screen. Anyways my thoughts on the film:


* Firstly I gotta get this off my chest. Freakin Tom Holland nailed Peter Parker/Spider-Man quite amazing! Marvel nailed the casting and character. I loved very moment he was in the film. I'd say about 10 minutes total he's in the movie. More than a cameo I believe.
 
* Helmut Zemo is such a great villain in this film. No powers or strength, but he uses his intelligence to break the Avengers apart and was successful. I felt some sympathy towards him near the end when everything is revealed and why he did it.

* Black Panther. Oh my he was awesome and definitely look forward to his solo movie. Sad it got pushed back to a later date instead of originally next year. His fighting skills and costumes were great. I can't wait to see Wakanda.

* Ant-Man. Holy crap surprised he went Giant-Man and that was awesome! His dialogue is quite funny as well with Cap and Iron-Man.

* The action choreography is one of the best I've scene. Well done fights and props to the stuntmen. They should be more recognized for their works in the Oscars/Movie awards. They busted their butts off for these scenes.

* The CGI for young RDJ is great too. Very realistic like they did with Michael Douglass in Ant-Man.

* 1st act slow start, 2nd act the action kicks fantastic, and 3rd act sets up the climax great.
Man there's a lot to discuss, but overall great film. Better than Batman v Superman. The writing, pacing, dialogue, and action were great. Looking forward to the Russo Brothers handling Avengers Infinity War.",4i35uf
d2xtmz7,"""OK. Anybody on our side hiding any shocking, or fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose, I'm open to suggestion.""

This line had me cracking up after we see Giant Man. ",4i35uf
d35zl3w,"I enjoyed it immensely but I don't find it as fantastic as most people here found it. I had a few problems with it:

1. The Vision. Why use the Vision in the airport fight if he did next to nothing? He is powered by an infinity stone, made out of vibranium, and yet he...zapped a control tower, zapped Falcon and missed and hit Rhodey, and maybe did one or two hits? Also, I think having him take a side at all was pretty problematic because if he can lift Mjolnir, he must have a pure heart and mind, yes? So how could I disagree with someone who has the ""correct"" mindset?

2. Speaking as someone who was Team Iron Man going in, and remained that way for most of the film, I was a little put off that Cap essentially wins. He has nearly every Avenger on his side (aside from of course Iron Man, Vision, and I guess Spidey if you want to count him) and I think giving Cap the opportunity to kill Tony made the fight pretty much won by Cap. I would've preferred it if the film ended with the Avengers more equally fractured, and also them fighting to a standstill.

3. Relatively minor, but I really appreciated that Zemo was not superhuman in any way, just a guy with a cause and some above average intellect. So how in the world did he get the face-changer technology to look like Bucky? Isn't that high-level SHIELD tech? How does he manage to get that?

d2vpam2,"Just watched this a few hours ago. I'm not much of a fan of comics, but I did read the CW arc back when this was announced. While I find a lot of comics to be tedious and poorly-written, I rather liked the CW arc.

It was an entertaining enough movie, the fights were outstanding and the storyline was decent. Spiderman's character was nearly pitch-perfect. The problem is that this movie threw out everything that made Civil War outstanding as a comic story.

1) In the comics, the law in question is far more alarming. It effectively mandates that ALL people with superpowers register with the government and abdicate their liberties. Captain America opposes it because it criminalizes them simply existing without reporting to the government. While Stark (and Reed Richards) make compelling arguments for such an act, Cap's stance in favor of liberty is beyond reproach.

The movie takes this oppressive overreach and turns it into ""we just want some accountability for the Avengers"". Instead of being threatened with prison simply for existing, they're told all they have to do to avoid prosecution is answer to a committee or put down their proverbial capes. It's something that could easily be negotiated into a very reasonable arrangement for the Avengers. Cap comes across as far more selfish and irrational in this. Instead of him fighting for the freedoms of everyone, he was fighting for his own right to be a vigilante/hero, and later to protect Bucky.

2) Speaking of Cap's speech, I'm irritated that they took it away from him and attributed to Carter in the movie. It's such an iconic expression of his character that it just feels wrong.

3) The scenario they set up for why Cap and Bucky go against the authorities is absurd. All Falcon would have had to do was get in the way of the SF and say ""Captain America is in there, and he's talking Barnes down peacefully right now. Let's form up a perimeter and give him some time."" I guarantee you they wouldn't risk being the guys who shot a guy who saved the world mulitple times because they were impatient.

4) Hot Aunt May is weird.

5) While we're on the subject of Spiderman, WHAT THE HELL MARVEL? The whole reason fans clamored for him to be in this movie is that his conversion from pro- to anti-registration was a pivotal moment. It never happens here, he just gets sent home like some kind of unpaid intern.

6) Why's it always gotta be the black guy that gets messed up in the big superhero fight? Nah, just kidding here. That scene with War Machine tumbling through the air was heart-wrenching and really had me feeling the moment. Wish they'd had the balls to kill him, because...it should have.

7) I really wanted to see some foreshadowing on what Sharon Carter eventually does (that's a potential spoiler for a future movie, so I'm not getting into specifics here). I didn't notice anything that hinted at it. That was disappointing.",4i35uf

d2v2or0,"I'm going to get downvoted to oblivion for this but i actually liked BvS more than Civil War. The whole argument in BvS about whether superman and his powers have a place in the world was just handled way better, there was a clear reason as to why superman was hated. In Civil War neither sides motivations are very clear quite frankly. I mean, cap doesn't agree with the accords because...bucky? And tony wants to sign them because one kid got killed in Sokovia ""because of the Avengers"" when if it weren't for them the whole world would have been destroyed.

I know the circlejerk loves to shit on BvS and Snyder in general but quite frankly BvS was just better.",4i35uf

d2usok0,"I thought it was just okay. Spider Man and Ant Man were by far the best parts. I was skeptical of Tom Holland but he proved me wrong. Dude blew it out of the water as Spidey.

However, I feel like Marvel is suffering by not ever letting their characters be in any actual real danger. The fact that there were almost no casualties during the entire ""war"" was a pretty big letdown. Rhodes just getting paralyzed could of worked out into some good drama though, but unfortunately they pull that punch and give him robo-legs that'll probably just make him being paralyzed a non-issue. 

Regardless, It's a really fun movie and the airport fight is some of the best action we'e had from Marvel. I just think they need to grow some balls and start giving this series a sense of dread and suspense on character fates.",4i35uf

Giant Ant Man was my best. Spiderman was funny. RDJ was great. Most of the characters weren't one dimensional. I didn't know what that Spiderman projection thing was in the after credits scene but the rest of that scene was pretty fun. Looking forward to more Russo brothers movies. ",4i35uf
d2v49qn,"First off, I loved the movie BUT as much as I liked Zemo his plan was fucking pure luck. 

There are easy too many assumptions he had to make for his plan to work. 

A. Rodgers would find Bucky before any of the other thousand super heroes did. 

B. He would be taken alive if someone else found him. 

C. Where they were talking him after capture. 

D. They would give him a psyche evaluation. 

E. Nobody would do a background on the psyche doctor and they would leave 1 guard at the door after sending 100 to capture him 

F. Tony WOULD sign the Accord - in my opinion this is my biggest gripe. The entire first Ironman movie is him, literally laughing at Congress, saying they won't get Ironman and he's the one responsible for decades of peace (in the 2nd movie). Everything he said and done to this point was anti-oversight 

G. Who would sign with what side. He had no knowledge of Thor, Hulk, etc. Everyone could have sided AGAINST cap and he'd have no chance. If anything, Thor could have just taken Cap to Asgard to avoid the whole confrontation, with or without Cap's approval. 

Again, I loved the movie, Zemo's motive, and that he wasn't trying to release the other soldiers but end them, but there are just too many questions about his plan. ",4i35uf
d2vfv6t,"I didn't like that they just washed over the fact that the Avengers (with the possible exception of the Hulk being out of control) literally saved the world multiple times. You could write off an entire continent and that'd be acceptable collateral damage to the *world continuing to exist*. Also the deaths caused by the things they fought vastly outweighed those caused by the Avengers.

As an actual film though, it was great. Just annoyed me they washed over a lot of stuff for narrative convenience.",4i35uf

- oh my the action was done so welll. Really the dialogue, plot, and acting were top notch.

-black panther and Spider-Man stole the show. Spider-Man was hilarious and kicked ass. Panther was just so bad ass and looked fucking sweet

-the humor was well done. Not too much but the jokes were all funny to me. Ant man had some great funny lines.

-this is probably my favorite marvel movie and I would say it's the best superhero movie since dark knight. I enjoyed this movie more but dark knight is a better film. Not by much though ",4i35uf
d2wi108,"Throughly enjoyed the movie. But there is a very big plot hole that has been bothering me. 

How did Zemo workout his master plan OR did he even have a master plan ? All 3 - Captain, Bucky and Iron man came to the party at Siberia by coincidence. And this guy was waiting with a video ?!

d2wimz3,"Thought it was a really good movie. For me personally, I'd put it number two for the Marvel movies, right after Winter Soldier. Since everyone is talking about how great it is and all they liked about it, I'm just gonna mention some issues I had with it, despite the downvotes I'll probably receive.

1. Too many heroes. Ant-Man and Spider-Man didn't have to be in the movie, and Spider-Man feels like he was added as an attempt to put even more butts in the seat, as he is Marvel's most popular hero. In order to make both of them fit in, they made them two of the funnier characters. No one is going to talk about how neither really needed to be there, but they'll talk about the, ""This is your conscience,"" line and how hilarious it was. I would just like to state, I loved both characters and thought they were funny, just unnecessary. 

2. The big fight between the two sides had no emotional impact. It was too quippy and felt like it was added more for pure entertainment than anything to do with the story line or the development of the characters themselves. To be fair the entire Team Cap vs. Team Iron Man didn't feel all that serious of a conflict throughout a lot of the movie, but this is supposed to be a fight over ideological differences between the two groups, who are more worried about cracking jokes than stopping the other side. So they add Rhodey getting shot down, by friendly fire of all things, rather than the two sides actually hurting each other, as a way to try to make you as the audience feel like there was some kind of weight to the battle, as if there was some actual impact from it. That's why despite not being as entertaining or funny, I prefer the fight at the end.

3. A love letter? Please tell me that's not how they resolve their differences. Tony just found out Bucky killed his parents and Steve knew about it the entire time. They just kicked the shit out of each other. There needs to still be tension between them all in future movies in order for this movie to have any true impact on the MCU.

4. Why the fuck was the underwater prison raised above water at the end? One of the things that made it so secure was it was underwater. Did one of the guards need a fresh air break or something, and Cap was just sitting there in a row boat waiting for such a thing to happen? ",4i35uf
d2wpxee,"I know most people reacted very positively, but I honestly thought it was a mess. The character motivations didn't feel realistic to me, never understood while they were fighting what the purpose of the fighting was or how far they were willing to go, and beyond that, from a technical perspective thought the editing was a particular weak spot. The ordering of the scenes was awkward, transitions felt unnatural and confusing, and the whole film was at least 20 minutes too long. That being said, there were a ton of great moments, lines, and scenes. But judging it as a complete film, and being a huge MCU fan, I walked away very disappointed.",4i35uf
d2una8a,I genuinely thought Iron Man was dead for a moment. ,4i35uf

d2unkto,"I like how the team is split into two factions now, divided yet together. I can't wait for the Spiderman movie and the Antman sequel, I think they really got Spiderman down pat. Hopefully this will open the door for Fox agreeing to play ball with Disney/Marvel Studios, and lending some of their character rights back, like the Fantastic Four. The MCU could really use a boost in the villain department, although Zemo was a great step in the right direction in terms of being memorable, or at least more than most of the other generic villains they've had so far.

d2unm3e,I loved it. The airport fight scene was much better than I was expecting,4i35uf
d2unm7i,"I loved it, top to bottom. There were so many heroes, but nobody felt quite like just a cameo. Cap took a back seat here and there, but at the same time, he was always at the front of the action and we never lost track of the fact that he's in the title of this movie. The back-and-forth conflict between Tony and Cap was perfect - through however many movies, Tony has just been building up to the point where he loses it over his *mom* and it was so well done. And it quietly set up Infinity War, because nothing but Thanos is really going to bring these guys together again. Spider-Man was perfect. Aunt May made me feel things that no Aunt May has done before.

d2unnv8,"This movie is everything I ever dreamed it could be and more. I absolutely loved it.

Totally put into perspective his thinking of how he's feeling responsible now for actions caused by the villainous behavior that starts it. 

Also, Zemo was an evil genius. You can say that he failed in the end, but he broke up the Avengers. When the Infinity War comes, they won't be able to work together. He may not have made a mark in this movie, but what Zemo did will carry over to the other movies.

d2uvb7o,Did anyone else get a weird feel from the CGI? Sometimes it felt like things were being thrown around a bit too quickly. Another weird part was the Bucky/Cap/Panther chase scene the way they sprinted down the road looked really odd to me.,4i35uf
d2uvcv6,Great movie that leaves up to the audience who to root for. Both cap's and iron man's teams had their support and good points to be supported. Very well written movie.,4i35uf

d2uxlnh,"8.5 - 9.0 somewhere for me. I don't like the first half of the movie, it feels a bit slow, but the second half saves the whole movie...The conflict is well established and not forced, and they really spent the efforts to find the righteous justification for both sides, and make it into a real dilemma...Big kudos to the staff! Enjoy it a lot.",4i35uf
d2uxn5h,nice movie,4i35uf
d2uzwv0,"Marvel did a great job introducing new characters and lifting up the ""smaller"" characters.  I thought both the introduction to T'Challa and Spiderman both were done very well, even though Spiderman's introduction was very brief and we don't see much of his motivation besides helping ""Mr. Stark."" I also thought Sam Wilson and Scott Lange got some great screen time and fleshed out their characters in solid ways.  People usually look to Iron Man and Captain America, but the new and less known characters stole the movie for me.",4i35uf

Even though there are tons of characters, they all have a significant and meaningful part.

Also Black Panther and Spider Man just stole it.

The only gripe I have with the film, was the scene in the beginning, where Tony Stark, meets the lady that shows a picture of her son, and said that he died during the battle of Sokovia, which finally started him down the path to regulate the avengers. I just felt like that scene was sort of forced onto us, but other than that, it was an excellent movie. It has overtaken Winter Soldier, as the best Marvel movie out. I kind of wish, that the Russo  brothers would take over the Avengers movies now as well.",4i35uf
d2vhuoi,I think my favorite bit of anything in the film is the acting RDJ does when him and Bucky are tangling during his escape from Berlin.

1) See it. Seriously, it's pretty great!

2) Make sure you see it in 3D. I'm normally a big nay-sayer on 3D, but it really serves this movie well. I saw it once with and once without 3D and the 3D version was better.

Things were just kind of muddled and shaky in the normal version. Also it was significantly darker which really sucked.

3) The humor was amazing. It added so much personality to the film, but was never overbearing or intrusive.

4) 9.5/10, the best movie in the MCU imo.",4i35uf

Just seemed like a heavy presence of her, without ever actually seeing her.",4i35uf
d2vyzbr,"Great movie!  I have enjoyed the Cap movies the most.  They've all been good.  Waiting for a WW2 movie.  Anyway, this was a great movie all around.

d2x5ovl,"All in all, I thought it was great. Not quite as good as The Winter Soldier (if only because of the twist), but a solid smart action film that really used it's new characters well. Black Panther and Spider Man rocked it and got the right amount of development to make them more interesting than Quicksilver or Scarlet Witch were in AoU. Scarlet got a lot better in this film, too. I like how she's basically treated as a kid who could destroy the world in the blink of an eye and has a paternal relationship with Vision. Zemo was an excellent antagonist and I really hope we'll see him in Black Panther or something like soon. The actor said he would be setting up some plots to come.",4i35uf

d2x9mx5,"Really enjoyed the movie.
Loved ant-man and Tom Holland was way better then I would've thought.
Action scenes were also great!

What I disliked was the fact that both the comic and the trailers looked dark/serious. The movie however was more lighthearted. 
That's why I never got the feeling that anyone can was in real danger. Or it was a serious fight.
(Except when the soldiers came for Bucky!)",4i35uf
d2xfohd,"What an emotional rollercoaster, it was nice to see such strong character development in Tony. Although I am team cap I was able to sympathize with all sides and understood everyone's struggles due to the great script/acting.  

The only flaw was how Tony was able to catch up with Steve & Bucky despite having to  take care of Rhodey and pay the others a visit at the prison. Seemed like lazy writing. ",4i35uf
d2xinsh,"Freaking great. I'm sure time will dull it but it's definitely one my favorite super hero movies. RDJ was so good in this movie. IDK if it was make up, great acting, or probably both, but he just looked tired, old, and worn out. I loved it. He was also such a dick. I hope it comes back on him that he goes to a teenage kid and basically manipulated him into fighting. And Zemo was fantastic. So many shitty villains in super hero movies but Zemo had great achievable motives. ",4i35uf

Those heroes at the end were only in prison because of that paper. They can't hang out anymore BECAUSE of that paper. Zemo exposed that Bucky was brainwashed into killing the Starks and who knows how many others. Thanks? As far as I'm concerned he did a good thing. He basically cleared Bucky's name for all that shit. ""OMG, now Tony is a little pissed!"" Like any logical person, he'll realize it wasn't his fault and just blame Hydra. Black Panther thought Bucky killed his father(sure, one was a dude disguised as a dude, killing another dude and the other was a really a group of dudes in some dude's head, but not TOO different).

Yes, I have to agree because back in 1980 if somebody told me about a movie from 1944, it would've been ""really old"" to me.

In fact May seems flirtatious towards Tony; not the behavior I'd expect from a grieving widow less than six months after her husband's death.

Early in the scene when Secretary of State Ross comes to Avengers Tower to introduce the Sokovia Accords.

Tony is doing something with his hand, and for just a moment, there's a glint of something gold on his finger...

This movie is on this list. I didn't want it to be there. It's a good movie. BUT - once Steve Rogers found Bucky and found out that Bucky was probably not the guy, he didn't tell the other avengers what he knew. Maybe it was cut - but I listened for it. Yes, I know most people simply assume and accept that this dialogue took place somewhere - but in my mind, this giant conflict only makes sense if Steve did not say what he knew.

d4ave1o,"I just finished watching it. I need to rant. Hard. Feel free to downvote, but keep in mind, it's all just opinions for the most part.

AND HOLY FUCK THAT MOVIE WAS SO STUPID. This is going to be all over the place.

First off, the whole ""The government needs rules for you"" bullshit. Who the everloving fuck is going to complain ""Oh the avengers stopped an alien invasion trying to exterminate the humans or enslave them or whatever and let a few people die in the process?!? How irresponsible! Fuck those guys!!!!!!"" or ""Those terrorists potentially stole smallpox and the avengers killed 12 guys in the process of stopping it and were successful? THEY NEED TO BE PUT IN JAIL 12 PEOPLE DIED IN THE PROCESS OF STOPPING A PLAGUE CAPABLE OF KILLING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS!""

Seriously, think about this in the real world. America is already drone striking 'terrorists' and killing dozens of innocents. If someone is threatening to bomb somewhere, you don't just let them because one or two people might die in the process of saving thousands. In WWII the USA put japanese folk in concentration camps. Does anyone care because they were innocent? No, you barely even hear about it. The innocent people killed in the process of stopping the Nazis, does anyone really think ""Nah mate, we should've let the Nazis do their thing, a few innocent people might die in the crossfire"". Sure it's not optimal, no one likes killing innocent civilians... But what the fuck is that horse shit?

And the way it portrays the entire government as non corrupt and upstanding caring about the bottom line and rules? Sure. Everything is done by the book and laws are never broken. Fine it's an american movie, so whatever, I can look past that.

But then the whole bucky breakout stuff. Firstly, you really think cap and his friends managed to somehow cut the power while never leaving the room/building they were in? Bull. Shit. But again, fine, there's a lot of ""Because movie"" sci-fi tech. So why not, right? Not to mention I wasn't really clear on the fact of whether or not they blamed Steve/Cap for the breakout, or they thought it was opportunistic.

But here's the real kick in the teeth.

The fucking shrink. They have video of the shrink getting killed. People obviously know what he looks like. And you mean to tell me no one in that building knew the guy? Or had ever even seen a picture of him?? I mean how the fuck do you overlook that? No one didn't go ""wait, that's not his voice? Who the fuck is this guy?"" In the interrogation? No one fucking checked the guys name/ID against a picture? You'd think in such a high stakes scenario they'd at least look at a fucking picture of the psychologist and go ""Hmm... yeah no mate, this isn't you. Get lost.""

And then you're supposed to sympathize with Cap in the end? Because he stuck up for his friends? Despite Cap being the reason this entire thing happened? Yeah Bucky was framed. But the only reason tony, steve, everyone fought was because Steve was stupid enough to go after the guy. Tony was right. Not to mention you'd think they'd eventually look into the shrink getting offed, right? Like... Fuck the guy even got attacked by the shrink. You'd think Steve would go ""hey guys the shrink was behind this"" and they'd eventually review the footage and go. ""Hm, yeah you're right. I'll be damned"".

Instead Cap fucking chases after the guy, causing huge damage and divides in the avengers. Which even just proves Tony's point.

So while I disagree with the guys going ""oh the humanity! The avengers saved the planet again and less than a dozen people died! Lock them up!"", they have a fucking point if Steve acts like that.

But of course Tony had to find out later that Steve was actually right. Like holy shit dude, had steve said something, and tony looked into it, it could've been avoided at lot earlier on. But nooooo, because movie.

Then I'm going to skip all the other minor annoyances to focus on the end. (Also noting that somehow tony is still at fault for Don's back being broken, because he didn't believe Cap. Despite cap being at fault for this whole fucking mess) (Also ignoring crap like the angry woman whose son died and the ""chemistry"" between steve and that chick).

Fucking Tony's parents. Somehow Tony is the bad guy because Steve lied to him? And Bucky murdered his parents? ""But no it's okay because he wasn't himself then! Oh btw I don't think he should be in a mental institute, he's clearly sane. Despite being manipulated earlier in the film already. You're the bad guys for wanting to lock him up!!""

But fuck that whole scene.

The kick in the teeth was that letter at the end. ""Lol ur parents r ded but its ok because i wrote this nice letter i fixed it haha"". Like how does that make anything better?

Thought props on the fight scenes. Satisfying as hell. Great choreography. Though balance is all weird. Sometimes tony can barely take on one guy, then in the end he nearly kills Cap and Bucky singlehandedly? And black panther is fucking OP, but did fuck all. And scarlet witch. Sometimes she's OP as fuck, other times she's a weak distracted little girl. Somehow hawkeye can survive being thrown around like a puppet, but cheedle breaks his back after a fall in a suit. Sometimes Tony can blow things up with his lasers no problem, other times they don't even scratch stone. I don't get it.

Spiderman though. They nailed him. While I'm not a fan of this 'peter' (his mannerism, not his mannerisms as spidey) they somehow nailed him, while somehow not nailing him at all. Honestly probably the best spidey so far. Love him in the movie.

All in all, it wasn't that bad. It was stupid as all hell. But satisfying. It's a summer dude flick. What can you expect.

Honestly I wouldn't even write this if it weren't for the 9/10s this movie is getting.

It's. not. that. good. Any, and I do mean any amount of thought put into this makes it fall apart at the seams.

Had this movie gotten 7/10s and such, I wouldn't even care. It deserves a 7/10. It's fun, even if brain dead and hooked to life support to pretend it's got some deepness to it.

It's the polar opposite of something like exmachina or it follows. On my first watches/glance of them, I thought they were pretty dull, bad. But the more you think about them, the better they get. I remember watching ExMachina and thinking ""huh... well that was dumb"". But then I thought about it. The programmer was right. He wasn't the bad guy, they were just machines. And the guest was manipulated. The AI never cared, it was truly advanced. And with it follows, at first I thought what everyone thought. ""Well, great concept, except it doesn't even follow its own rules"". But then you realize, that's the whole point. The only ""rules"" come from word of mouth and first hand experience. You only know, that 'it follows' (and changes shape, and is sexually transmitted, and invisible to everyone else, you get the point). Anything else is just speculation. That's what makes it that much more scary.

Personally, I'd give it a 6/10. Not good, not bad. On the side of good because without thought it is really a fun movie.

But these marvel can do no wrong 9/10 reviews really irk me now.


--------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR; It's a 6/10 movie getting 10/10 scores. And for some reason that bothers me. I don't know why. Probably because all of my friends and the world is buzzing about how good it was. But it just makes no sense. I guess the other film were just well enough written for my suspension of disbelief to be there. But this one just slapped me in the face too much, and expected me to believe too much bullshit ""because movie"" logic for there to be any reasonable suspension of disbelief.



----------------------------------

It's like the transformer movies. Visually gorgeous, and satisfying to watch. But if you expect the logic and plot (and physics, in both films) to be good? Then you're sorely mistaken. Fun movies, really fun. But nothing more than a 7/10 at most. Dumb summer blockbuster fun. Not a 10/10 masterpiece in the slightest.

And I do truly feel that this movie gets away with a lot of it because people have a huge hardon for marvel at the moment. I like the films too, but I'm not blindly drawn to them. Which is probably obvious given how long I've waited to see it.

It has it's merits, and truly good lines and scenes. But that's just overshadowed by the mess of a story, and blind hype and praise.

So there you have it. If you disagree, let me know. I probably wont care tomorrow, but I currently have two friends pestering me about how good it was, right? I dunno, maybe the hype ruined this movie for me more than it did itself. It certainly payed a huge part. Then again, the whole government stuff. Ugh.

Please, don't feel offended if you like this movie. There's nothing wrong with that, and I'm not attaching you for liking it. We all have different tastes :)

Seriously, if you feel upset or offended, I'm sorry :/ Maybe a nice letter and a cheap flip phone will make amends?

I jest.

Qedit: Also Tony Stank was incredibly hilarious. So huge props to that cameo and joke :p. And seriously, every scene with spiderman was fantastic. ",4i35uf
d7xfy2i,"Obviously at 4 months after release, I'm anything but timely in my finally watching this movie, but I wanted to attempt to add something to this discussion: this struck me as the first modern comic book movie (Edit: at least, the first MCU movie) to not only acknowledge collateral damage in a direct way, but also explore the possible consequences of it.

The woman confronting Tony in the basement.

Zemu's entire motivation for what he is doing.

BP's coming out into the public to avenge his father.

The montage of footage showing innocent civilians being caught in the crossfire and destruction (which, as far as I can recall, is the more typical kind of collateral damage exploration we get).

This was a real in-your-face examination of collateral damage, and I appreciated that immensely.  We've seen villains come into the fray motivated to counter what super heroes do--I'm thinking of Iron Man 2's Whiplash, for instance.  And we've seen initiatives spurned on by lessons learned from past engagements (S.H.I.E.L.D. developing the automated helicarriers in case of another massive invasion).  But innocent bystanders' actions out of retaliation?  Very good.",4i35uf
d2uy86x,"it is one of the better marvel movies but ultimately the execution and payoff felt very lacking. 

the inciting incident was solid.  scarlet witch kills civilians while saving captain America's life.  that made sense and that gave the film a solid moral standing.  these guys are heroes fighting villains but they make decisions on the fly and it can lead to civilian deaths.  

unfortunately the film veers away from that moral conundrum and simplifies down to Bucky being framed for a (very telegraphed) assassination, capt America knowing it and iron man not knowing it.  

in the backdrop we keep seeing this mission bucky did, it's clear it's important but it's not explained why until the end, which was very satisfying.  

the humor is top notch throughout this film.  every character has their corny ""I'm a super hero doing something mundane"" line but it worked and audiences laughed.  

antman and spiderman steal the scenes they are in.  and this is from a guy who immediately disliked spiderman when he showed up.  their dialogue during the airport fight sequence is top notch... ""I believe this is yours, Captain America"" ant man says doing his best impression of what a super hero says to another super hero in comics.  or ""they aren't stopping running"" spiderman says as the two crews bum rush each other. 

truly the airport sequence was the high water mark of the film.  each fight is top notch, it is serious yet humorous because we know they aren't really going for the kill, they are trying to knock each other out.  

I loved the subversion of the marvel trope in the 3rd act.  

we are led to believe this new villain wants to unleash 5 superhuman monsters, because that's what every other  marvel villain would do.  but he doesn't.  we discover he killed them, because he hates superhumans because his family got killed from super humans, albeit indirectly.  

so now we get to the big showdown.  Ironman vs captain America and winter soldier... which we saw in the trailer (really marvel fucked up by showing the entire movie in the trailer).  and this is what made me dislike the movie.  we lost the tension.  no one died.  

iron man is justified in his anger and drive for vengeance, winter soldier strangled his mom.  capt America and winter soldier are justified, bucky was brain washed and is different now.  there is no bad guy in this fight.  this is the perfect fight for someone, either iron man or capt America, to die.  this is what the film was leading too. 

and then it just ends.  capt wins in a lame way (iron man's suits power is really that light!?! why has no one broken it before??) 

and we get a letter from stevie to Tony saying, hey, we are pals, like me know when thanos shows up.  

it was an enjoyable film but it's a comic book movie that played it safe probably due to contracts and production company stuff.  

humor was on point.  action was fun. pacing was great.  fake out deaths were super lame (rhodey should have died to add weight to the film).  lack of any consequence was lame (avengers are broken up but stevo is down to hang whenever Tony wants) .

also the two post credit scenes are super lame, especially the spiderman one.  the capt America one should've been in the actual film. ",4i35uf

As with the first Avengers, they managed to fit everything in without it feeling forced or shoehorned in. (Looking at you BvS). I know this has been repeated but this is a very mature movie yet they succeeded in some lighter dialogue too. Two Thumbs up

Thumbs up on the new Spidey as well. ",4i35uf
d2w1giu,"Okay I am back from the theatre just now. Holy shit balls, that was amazing. This was possibly the best comedy of the year, the best action of the year, all packed into the best superhero movie of the year!

I think we are now on the verge of moving to the next generation of Marvel superheroes -- not just the Avengers.",4i35uf
d2wkaip,"Another notch on this movie's belt I noted during the second viewing. During T'Challa and Bucky's fight in Berlin they pause a moment to show T'Challa's royal ring vibrating in response to Bucky's arm. The movie does not bother to stop the momentum to say ""Vibranium is effective against vibranium"" it displayed it for a couple seconds and moved on. The claw-marks on the shield also stand to prove Panther is the perfect match for the Super Soldier duo.

Makes you wonder how the hell Tony blasted Bucky's arm off and whether or not he had it in him to blast through Steve's shield during the final fight.",4i35uf
d2xhx1d,Aunt May = Aunt Bae.,4i35uf
d2v7dkz,"I had a lot of fun. It was an amazing piece of entertainment.

That being said, people like to accuse some directors of throwing action figures in a box and shaking it around. This movie is that more than any other. The airport scene (which was awesome, one of the best scenes in any Marvel movie) had no business being in this movie, and most of the characters had no business being there.

Why is Spider-Man in this movie? His inclusion makes absolutely no sense with the plot. Having said that, he was absolutely amazing.",4i35uf
d2uq6if,"Probably an unpopular opinion, but I wasn't as satisfied as I thought I would be. Don't get me wrong, I love the movie and the action scene blew my mind, especially with Spider-Man appearing and Ant-Man going giant. But I'm not sure why I was not as satisfied. Perhaps it could be:

* While I understand it is first and foremost, a Captain America movie, I believed the Civil War should be the center stage of the plot. Instead I felt it was secondary and derivative and the movie felt more like Winter Soldier 2. The Civil War arc in the comics was huge and I truly thought it should have more coverage and be more indepth.

* I felt Zemo was redundant and his motivation weren't that strong. Losing your family was devastating but I'm sure most people in Sekovia did and they didn't go crazy. Regardless, even without Zemo in the movie, I felt the Avengers would have met at a standstill regardless. Adding Zemo into the plot may have complicated things a bit too much imho. Also, I was dissapointed he didn't put on a purple mask in the Artic while talking to Cap and Iron Man through that blast door like a dramatic villian reveal would. Shame.

* Lastly, while I know that there are 2 Spider-Man origins already, I would perhaps have loved a flashback to Uncle Ben's death when Peter was talking about protecting the little guys. The fact he didn't say *the* quote was upsetting to me as well. I guess Homecoming would flesh out his character more.

Not sure why, but I felt the movie could have been better. Still great tho! 5/7",4i35uf
d2uu3av,The big location names stretching across the screen took me out of the film every time they appeared.,4i35uf
d2uv9lj,"So... since no one has said it.. Cap didn't die.  I'm actually upset about it, because that last fight scene had so much where I was like ""Oh my god, if they kill Cap this will be unforgettable."" But then they didn't ... I get the whole, we can't kill the main character thing, but... source material.  That's the ending.",4i35uf
d2w6vqe,"Thought it was alright. 7/10.

I'm tempted to make a joke about how shaky the camera was during fight scenes, but it would probably be in really bad taste.
I thought it could be a little darker. For a civil war, it was kind of meh.

I would also hate to be Baron Zemo, as he is probably going to die in the first 15 minutes of the next movie (on Earth).",4i35uf
d2urb5k,The plot of this movie was much like my meetings at work: two hours for what could have been an email.,4i35uf
d2uttd4,now THAT is how you do a superhero battle. that airport fight scene is probably the best comic book brawl in movie history. can't wait to see it again.,4i35uf
d2uxu4b,This movie really make me wish that Russo brothers had made the Batman Vs Superman. Wouldn't it have been great if Lex had done more like Zemo was in this film.,4i35uf
d2v225v,"What I don't understand is Tony recruited Spiderman to his side so Peter would need to sign the papers and people would know who he is.

I'm interested to see how they explain it. ",4i35uf

And good job making it more of a Captain America movie, rather than an avengers movie. Definitely in my top 5 superhero movies. 8.5/10.  
  
  
Edit: Grammar",4i35uf
d2vpd22,"One more thing... the DVD player that Peter is carrying.  I could be mistaken, but I think that may be a Sony player.  A subtle way to say that Sony has been unplugged from the franchise.",4i35uf
d2wcxgj,"I loved it, and I will say that I legitimately believe it's the best Marvel movie to date. I had just about zero qualms with it. It manages to balance all of these characters as well as properly introduce three new characters on top of all the established ones! Everyone's motivations are clear, just about every character gets a little bit of development, and you feel for all of them, just trying to do what they feel is the right thing. Neither side managed to seem more ""right"" than the other, and by the end when Cap goes for the final strike you just desperately want the fight to end. This puts them in a really bad place for Avengers 3 and 4, and it'll be interesting to see how they bring them all back together.

The only complaints I have are in the Peter Parker scene. Sexy Aunt May is really weird (I know that in terms of a timeline it makes more sense for Aunt May to be younger, but she's always been an old lady. Having a younger Aunt May in ASM was weird, and having a younger, kind of hot Aunt May in this one is also weird). Also, having Peter *not* say the great responsibility line when asked, ""Why do you get up in the morning?"" seems like a mistake to me. ",4i35uf

d2ut1q5,"I enjoyed the movie I definitely did.   However everyone's motivations were so fucking stupid to me.   The lady waiting randomly in the backstage area hall with a picture of her dead son to give to Tony.  She had zero way of knowing he would come that way.  Then omg I blame you! 
Yea that makes sense..  Don't blame the huge fucking robot that had an army and had raised half a city to be used as a meteor and to wipe out life as we know it..  No blame the people that have saved the world dozens of times over.   Zemo was the same exact thing.  Yea your family died, it's tragic but grow the fuck up and stop blaming others for all of your problems. Shit happens in life and sometimes it's no one's fault.   Not to mention I don't buy for a second this guy could have pulled off half the crap he did.  The explosion at the U. N.  LOL  as if that would have gotten by security.

I loved Spiderman hands down the best thing in the movie.

Besides that...maybe TWS and Cap vs Tony?

Other than that, I really hated the movie....I was so hyped... but I was so let down.

To me they just used this movie as dialog to set up phase 3 and to set up sequels to Ant-Man, a stand alone for spiderman, black panther, and maybe black widow?

Out of the 3 Cap movies, this is by far my least favorite.

I know I am the minor right now, but I was so hyped for this movie. I feel like Tony did after the cap fight.",4i35uf

d2usun6,"Liked it, didn't love it.

Would have loved it IF (very big IF), Steve Rogers hadn't been weirdly un-Steve Rogers like (in the MCU) and kept vital information from his friend that might have defused the entire situation between them before the movie started.

I mean it had to be for the amazing final fight, but it also comes to me as a contrast of what he stood against in Winter Soldier. ",4i35uf

I loved the humor between Falcon, Bucky and Cap.

Spider""man"" also felt surprisingly fitting in the scenes and i loved the part where hes told you dont talk alot in combat lol

Story was a bit thin but it didnt matter for me as i got alot of cool fights we havent seen in the other movies.

Only problem for me was the end dragged on a bit, it was a nice finish to the villians story but took a bit time to get to it.

Overall i placed it just behind Winter Soldier in score, way ahead of the first Captain America.

Was it a nod to the comics or setting something up that I'm missing with Vision? Otherwise I loved just about everything about the movie.,4i35uf
d2w2jfq,"While finding it very entertaining and well-written for the characters I had issues with the plot.  Not sure I buy Tony being so dense, especially after being proven wrong two-thirds through and not understanding the involuntary nature of Winter Soldier's missions.  Also him buying into the whole ""Avengers need oversight"" argument, which I found absurd.  All the justifications given for that were either damages directly caused by the villains Avengers were fighting or honest collateral damage, whose benefits likely far outweighed the damage that would have otherwise resulted (What if that bioweapon was released in a city?).  And the witch threw the grenade upwards, which would have blown up in the middle of a crowd and likely killed far more people, so holding that against her also made zero sense.  This movie left my opinion of Iron Man deep in the gutter so I hope future movies redeem him.",4i35uf

d2x5fh0,"I don't know the Civil War storyline in the comics, but I always felt Stark was the anti-government rogue hero and Captain America was the ""company man"" who followed orders.  Just seemed odd that Stark would agree so quickly into giving up his independence to be supervised by a government he doesn't trust while Rogers fought the establishment.  ",4i35uf
d2x79gt,"I did not get Tony's motivation at the end of that movie. Tony knew that Bucky was a pre-programed vegetable being forced to kill his parents. He called him the Manchurian Candidate like two minutes before he raged out, a character that is literally an unwitting and unwilling assassin. Knowing this, he still tries to kill Bucky in cold blood when he finds out that Bucky's pre-programed flesh killed his parents.

Wouldn't the only proper people to be angry at in that moment be HYDRA (and maybe Cap for keeping facts secret from him).

Am I the only one in the world that found this to be a pretty big flaw? Or is it just supposed to mean that Tony went crazy?",4i35uf
d2x96qy,"When Bucky was trying to destroy the arc reactor with his metal arm, the other hand was pushing Iron Man's face away, and they kept showing a shot of them in line, with CA behind them.

d2xjkkk,"I loved this almost top-to-bottom, but the ending didn't really work for me. Cutting right to Tony and Rhodey joking around (""Tony Stank"" etc) really undercut the emotional conclusion of Tony/Steve's fight, and the letter from Cap felt really ""we need to end the movie, fuck it, put a voiceover in there or something."" The ""You lost, villain"" ""OR DID IIIIIII"" thing was silly too. I would have much preferred it to end with that excellent shot of broken-down Iron Man with Cap's shield on the ground, that last 10-15 minutes felt like an eternity. ",4i35uf
d2xjrj2,"What really gets me is the similarities between civil war and BVS. Bvs went for this grim dark atmosphere yet civil war did a very similar storyline to a much more... Mature tone. And yet it still had humor, great acting, development, etc.

d2xs24r,"What I liked about it was that as serious as the material was, it was also so so much fun. The quips that were complained about in Age of Ultron actually worked here.

d2ycnar,Also Zemo is easily the greatest MCU antagonist since Loki. That attempted suicide after his victory took the cake.,4i35uf
d312jtr,"Some people have mentioned how they couldn't take the fight seriously because nobody died and everyone was cracking jokes the majority of the time, but I actually thought this was some great story pacing and emotional pacing, because the WHOLE fight ends with someone getting seriously injured for REAL and by someone on his team who misfired in the chaos. I don't think ANY of the Avengers seriously thought about the consequences of their fight or what this could mean until that moment occurred. Tony kind of freaked out (to his credit), when he thought Spider-man nearly ate it towards the end of the fight, but it really hit home when neither Iron Man nor Falcon could reach War Machine in time. IMO that scene was brutal, and I don't think anybody needed to die to drive the point home. Here everybody was joking and not seriously fighting each other (except maybe Black Panther and Bucky when he was up against certain opponents), and look at what happens. When Natasha tells Tony ""We played this wrong"" or whatever, she nailed it. 

Which is actually why a part of me is kind of Team Black Widow in this movie. Natasha is, by the end of it and even before War Machine gets hurt, able to see what's happening, which I understood as the main reason she let's Cap and Bucky go (not to mention she knows Cap very very well - would he really only be fighting to selfishly save his friend, as Tony tries to selfishly assuage his own guilt? Plus, they finally alluded to the fact the Bucky and Natasha might actually know each other). On one hand, she sees that there is a real problem with the way the Avengers have been operating - for all the good they ultimately do, they need to start thinking of ways to address the problems they do cause. Even Cap doesn't propose having a dialogue about how to address these problems (not that he's given much time). 

At first Natasha jumps on board with the accords, but realizes later she was fare too hasty about it - look at what it lead to. The very people they signed with *immediately* went on a hunt-to-kill mission for Bucky, WITHOUT first bothering to send any of the signed Avengers who could have probably taken him alive for questioning and trial. Tony wasn't interested in listening to Steve because for Tony, everything is personal - and he can't imagine it being any other way for Steve either - and it led to a brawl that, tbh, nobody but T'Challa and occasionally Bucky was taking seriously (as in - nobody really saw their opponents as true enemies). But Natasha realized it in the middle of the fight, and she let Steve and Bucky go. Everybody else realized it when War Machine got hurt. 

/so many thoughts.",4i35uf
d2uwa10,"I think I'm the only person in the world who didn't like this movie. I will freely admit, there were a lot of good moments and character bits, but there were so many little things that just took me out of the story. ",4i35uf
d2uv21n,"I've always been pretty critical of the MCU films. I think they tend to be mildly entertaining but forgettable films, so I was skeptical about the hype for this one. 

The hype was well-deserved, though. It was pretty awesome. One of my biggest complaints about the MCU is the overuse of jokes and quips to break the tension, and thankfully this one actually kept them to a minimum. They also really delved into the characterization of the heroes, which also seemed fairly lacking in the other films. 

The score was cheesy as hell, though, and as someone on another forum said ""it was a movie about consequences with no consequences,"" which I feel is fairly true. 

Still, definitely exceeded my expectations. I think the Russos are gonna do great things with Infinity War.

d2xborm,"For me I loved the movie but I feel of unsatisfied. I don't feel there was anything wrong with the film (Besides the villain) but the reviews that I had seen before made it sound like the Dark Knight or something. I feel that it was a great movie but not as good as the Avengers or even Guardians of the Galaxy.

P.S. Spiderman was amazing.",4i35uf
d2us065,"Movie was great, not the best of MCU (winter soldier IMO)

This didn't feel like a cap movie and more an avengers universe movie with him and most of the movie hype was taken by panther and spiderman 

Was shocked when I saw the credits that Marisa Tomei was Aunt May.

Good movie but as usual my movie experience gets ruined by fan boys and girls nonstop clapping, chirping, cheering, hooting for any small scene. Yes it's ant man appearing, doesn't need an applause.

You can tell Marvel played it safe, I went into this with the belief someone was dying.",4i35uf
d2v9w4p,"I have to say that I for one was on Starks' side all along. Like Cap didn't even know for sure that Bucky was innocent during the bombing of the meeting where they discussed the whole thing with T'chaka etc. So I think he was acting very selfish, and I understand why the others saw him as a criminal. He helped his friend escape persecution, harming other people in the process. 
It's noble of him to try and help save a friend, but it's still just sort of unjustified, because he helped him, still somewhat unsure whether or not he was the bomber. 
I was just hoping that Stark would beat the crap out of Cap for some reason, I don't even know why haha. 
Anyway, Team Stark all the way, they had most of the Avengers that I like, while Cap had... I dunno, Ant-Man and Scarlet Witch, the only ones I like from his team. 
I think it's interesting because I feel as if there's a bit of a political twist to it all, but I generally FELT like Cap was the bad guy in the fight scene, and I think that a lot of people viewed that scene completely differently. 

Also yeah, Spiderman looked like shit, it looked like unfinished CGI. Like seriously, either give him a real suit that actually looks somewhat good, or make it look real with CGI, when I saw him in his gear I was like ""yeah that looks so fake"", and I dunno. 
",4i35uf
d2uxosv,"So.. Were we supposed to sympathize with Cap in this movie? Because I certainly didn't. He basically fought for an unsupervised death squad with unlimited resources. That whole ""even if the whole world tells you that you're wrong""-speech gave off some wonderfully fascist vibes.

Loved the movie, but I've always had trouble enjoying Captain America and his values.",4i35uf
d2vxhqc,"I loved it, but...

I feel the franchise is definitely starting sag under its own weight. By which, I mean I don't think someone who hasn't seen a significant amount of the MCU could watch this and appreciate it.

Its a common issue with sequels, but it's less of an issue when someone cam get caught up in an afternoon of Netflix, or a quick synopsis. It'd take days of viewing, or hours of explanation to provide context to everything happening in Civil War, and that barrier to entry is only going to grow larger over time.",4i35uf
d2unj0j,"Just got home from seeing it. It was good, but I would probably give it like a high 7 to an 8. Humor was great. Action was good, but a little too much shaky cam for my liking.

d2uxhmn,I guess I'm in the minority in thinking the villain was really weak. There was nothing he did that couldn't have happened without him. The Government was already looking for Bucky and Captain America and Bucky both knew about Stark's parents. I feel like all the Zemo stuff could have easily been transferred to General Ross who seemed like a better suited antagonist. Or just get rid of the villain all together. The movie was strongest when it was Stark and Rogers fighting over ideals. Idk maybe I'm wrong but I wasn't blown away by Zemo.,4i35uf
d2vajgj,"I really enjoyed this film, and it wasn't spoiled from the trailers as I was afraid of since I felt Age of Ultron kind of was. Here are the few minor critiques I have: 
1) I felt Spiderman was a little forced. I can't explain it well, but just felt that the scene of Tony Stark recruiting him and his presence during the fight felt out of place. It didn't fit in the with flow of the rest of the movie in my opinion. Like the pace stopped, we have to fit in this scene even though we could do it in other ways that make more sense. Like if Stark & Parker had already met somehow and been working together for awhile.  I also think it was a huge bad judgement call to bring him in to fight Avengers for his first fight. Everyone else pretty much knew what they were up against and chose to do so.  He's a kid and we don't know what he has been up against so to me that's another poor decision from Tony Stark. I do like Tom Holland as Spiderman, not sure we need another stand alone movie since we all know his story but I'm sure it'll be good. His fight scenes were good though I did forget he was just as strong as other Avengers and had to ask my husband about it.
2) I am not sure what has changed in the universe after this. Bucky & Cap are in hiding i guess but can be called when needed. The rest of them are at the Avengers headquarters, whatever its called. Just felt like something else needed to happen. Like the people calling the shots for them could have given them orders and they refused to do it since they didn't agree would be one example of a way to say they will not be controlled. I dunno. Maybe that's gonna be brought up in the next Avengers, Infinity War. Just seems like a wishy washy place to leave their story for two years. I'm sure we will see a few cameos in the movies in between with some end credits possibly filling in some information. 

I did really like this film, they handled having so many characters well, the introduction of Black Panther was awesome, great fight scenes, it was a well done movie. ",4i35uf
d2ve96f,Was it ever established that Tony doesn't need his heart thing to live anymore? I thought he was gonna die after Cap smashed it.,4i35uf
d2w2btp,"How does the Avengers, an international organization of superheroes, not hear about a huge UN initiative like the Sokovia Initiative until just before it was signed into effect in Geneva, Switzerland? 117 countries signed the thing before they even talked to the Avengers about this. Where was SHIELD? Where was Nick Fury with the Intel on this?

People keep saying SHIELD is underground, but don't you remember what SHIELD did in AOU? Using a giant helicarrier, a staple of SHIELD from the first Avengers film, and carrying out a significant civillian rescue operation in the middle of an Avenger battle where every live feed is going to be looking makes that a little hard to believe going into this film. SHIELD may have been underground after TWS, but after AOU I would find it hard to believe that no one knows they were involved in Sokovia. But even if it were true that SHIELD were underground and if they hadn't shown up in a pretty public way during AOU, all Fury would need to inform the Avengers about the Sokovia Accords would be government contacts and a phone call. I'd assume as theleader of a top notch organization of intel gathering even an underground one at that he'd still be able to that at least.

Second, in order to make this conflict work they had to turn Captain America into the biggest idiot in the world. ""Committees can change agenda."" Yeah, that's part of being in a democratic system, but glorious leader Captain Steve thinks he has the best judgment when it was pretty clear his judgment was impaired throughout the whole movie by his friendship with Bucky.

And finally, the reveal at the end and why Captain didn't talk to Tony about what happened is straight out of a romantic comedy. Character A doesn't talk to Character B about Event C and as a result the misunderstanding of or revealing of Event C breeds conflict. Amazing!

On to the good. Finally we have a decent villain from Marvel besides Loki. My only problem is a lot of his plan can only work if he knew about the Sokovia Accords being implemented which just brings up the question earlier of how everyone else but the Avengers could know about such an initiative in the first place. 

Fights were very good though sometimes a little too much shaky cam for my liking. Everyone played their parts well and sold the ""conflict"" even if it was built on shaky grounds.

For all the problems with BvS at least I seriously started doubting Superman survived.(Even if it sounds dumb). Here nothing made me feel that way, and everything was pretty much just cool fights and stuff.

What the movie did make a good job of is not shoehorning in some philosophy and leaving decision to the viewer,  I could see the ups and downs of both Caps and Tony's argument and didn't feel like either is necessarily wrong.",4i35uf

d2uu6fl,"While not as good as Winter Soldier for me, it's still way up there in terms of best Marvel movies thus far.  
  
The airport scene alone was just jaw-dropping in terms of scale, cohesiveness and execution.   
  
Spider-Man and Black Panther practically stole the show for me too and I can't wait for their solo movies (although now I'm really annoyed that BP got pushed back to 2018 -- I WANT MORE T'CHALLA NOW, DAMMIT).  
Tony hitting on Aunt May will never get old, and I expect that will be a good chunk of his role in Homecoming next year. Tom Holland as Spidey was absolutely perfect, and I say this after being skeptical of the reviews saying the exact same thing but damn if he wasn't the best on-screen Spider-Man we've ever had.   
  
The only thing that annoyed me watching this was the douchebag group seated behind me while I was watching the movie.  
They laughed/reacted at the worst times and were just generally obnoxious throughout:  
  
*   They laughed when Widow was fighting Bucky in Berlin (no idea why)
* They laughed when Panther stopped Zemo from pulling the trigger (seriously, he just tried to kill himself how is this funny?)
* Loudly ate a bag of FUCKING COCO PUFFS during the first half of the movie while loudly crinkling the damn cereal bag.  
* One of them says ""OUCH"" when Bucky smashes Howard's head in
* and one of them said loudly ""I THOUGHT THAT WAS DEADPOOL LOL"" after the last post credits scene.",4i35uf

d2uykms,"Sorry about the wall of text. I saw this a couple of weeks ago, and then again when it premiered, and there's some stuff that's been bothering me ever since, even though I generally liked the film.

The logistics and timeline of the movie is something best not dwelled upon. It's completely messed up. Especially towards the end.

An explosion in Austria starts a manhunt. The manhunt leads to Romania, where GERMAN special forces are brought in to seemingly kill Bucky on sight based on nothing but a blurry photograph (also killing him would ruin Zemo's convoluted plan right then and there). He is apprehended and brought to Berlin to a CIA facility for some reason.

Rogers and Sharon Carter appear to be in London after the funeral of Peggy Carter (which Black Widow also attended, presumably speeding to Vienna for the ratification right after)They talk about how she is based out of Berlin these days, when they hear about the explosion. Sharon, a member of a ""CIA anti-terrirism taskforce"", learns of this from Sam Wilson who saw it on the news. They then appear in Vienna almost instantly.

Ross gives Tony 36 hours to apprehend Cap and Bucky. Tony uses 24 hours to go to Brooklyn to recruit Spiderman because he knows there will be a big battle somehow. This is fine because Cap and Bucky choose to not leave Germany and go to the Hydra base immediately.

At the airport in Leipzig(?) before the big battle, Hawkeye says that he has ""a chopper lined up"". Presumably to fly to Siberia somehow??? This is quickly ruined, as it is blown up just as Cap is running towards it. War Machine is scanning the airport and exclaims the he's found their jet. What use the chopper was in this plan is unclear at this point.

Fighting happens. No one thinks to destroy the jet, which is their only way out at this point, and Cap and Bucky end up taking off flying straight to the base in Siberia.

Zemo arrives at the Siberian base, having travelled for at least 24 hours. He then calls for room service at his hotel in Austria, leading to the land lady discovering the body of the real psychologist, who was going to examine Bucky (who was hired by the CIA, without anyone knowing what he looked like or checking his identity). I assume that she calls the police, who then start an investigation, discovering the Bucky mask that Zemo used to stage the surveillance photo. This information is immediately broadcast on the news for Tony to hear, who, since the battle, has taken Rhodey home for scanning and treatment. Tony then goes to visit the underwater prison where Team Cap have already been processed and detained. Here he learns of the location of the base as well. He goes there and somehow arrives there about 5 minutes after Cap and Bucky even though he must have been DAYS or weeks behind them. T'challa must have been tailing Tony for all this time, hoping that he would somehow lead him to Bucky.

Sorry for the rant, but these are the things that bothered me the most about the movie. Like the other Captain America films, for me this ranks high in the number of Marvel films. There isn't an army of faceless minions that need to be destroyed at the end. It's about something personal to the characters that we have come to know through several films. The existence of the Marvel Cinematic Universe takes some of the thrill out of the the ending about whether or not they would actually kill Captain America. Antman and Spiderman provided some much-needed levity and elevated the big fight from what would have otherwise been a boring slug-fest.

PS: There totally wasn't a gate with a conveniently placed secuity camera in the middle of the forest right next to the car crash. And why didn't The Winter Soldier destroy the footage when he clearly didn't want the camera filming him?

PPS: Tony's BARF technology is introduced, but isn't used except to give us exposition about what his parents look like and how they died.",4i35uf
d2xaftb,"I don't know why, but I was underwhelmed. There was nothing bad about this one, but there really wasn't any moment that I thought ""wow, this is awesome"" like I got with either Avengers film, the first 2 captain Americas, or Guardians of the Galaxy. I mean, I know it's better than Superman/Batman, but even that movie, at least the last 10 minutes was me thinking ""that was awesome"". ",4i35uf
d2vtyl0,"If you're looking for a faithful or even ""spiritual,"" so to speak, adaptation of the classic story arc, you're going to be disappointed.  What we do get, though, is one of the best MCU movies to date.  It takes the basic framework and concepts of the original Civil War story and applies them to the current state of the MCU after Age of Ultron.  The characters that are introduced are handled incredibly (Black Panther and Spiderman), and it was great seeing Ant-Man make his debut with the rest of the gang too.  
My main gripes with it are with its use, or rather misuse, of villains.  It opens with Cap and company taking down Crossbones, which is a waste of a pretty significant villain.  Then, though Daniel Bruhl is excellent, Zemo appears and disappears in the background of the movie.  His role in the plot weakens everything about it.  It dumbs down the emotional and philosophical impact that the Civil War storyline could have made, reducing it all to be the result of some master plan of a revenge-seeking special ops guy.  The fact that he orchestrated it cuts short the conversation that should be had about the implications of the Accord.  On that note, I also wish the Accord more closely resembled the Superhuman Registration Act.  As it was presented in the film, it didn't make anything of the fact that every hero would also have to publicly reveal their identity.  I figured with Spiderman's introduction, though I loved it, they might try to make that whole part of the SRA a bigger deal.  Especially since that's half of Spiderman's plot line in the Civil War comic series.   I know Mark Millar was definitely very heavy handed with his allegory and writing it to paint Stark in a bad light, but this film was way, way too sympathetic to Tony.  I keep seeing people saying that Cap was the bad guy, and in this film, they truly made it look that way at times.  But if it had included even just a bit more of what the original SRA entailed, people would have been much more conflicted.  What about the implications of imprisoning your heroes?  Or the fact that villains are not bound by the same rules?  Though I know it's not supposed to be the SRA, it's just weird to me how heavily they dumbed down the truly nefarious nature of that legislation.  
My comments sound much more negative than I want them to.  There was so much to love about the film, and I truly loved it.  I just wish it hit me as hard as the comics.  I wanted others who may not have read the series to share in that experience, and I know they won't unless they take it upon themselves to read it after seeing the movie.

d2uwjb3,"My favourite parts:

* Chris Evans

* Bucky got actual development

* Tony's arc

* Fuckin Black Panther, man

* Scott Lange's dialogue, all of it

* The scale of it. No BIG DUMB ENDING, just characters and their conflict with each other.

* Vision and Wanda's relationship

My least favourite parts:

* Spider-Man (this *could* just be a reaction to the hype, I'm not sure, but basically I found him grating, one-note and utterly pointless to the actual story of the movie - also he looked fake as fuck!)

* A lot of the action was totally incomprehensible, which was disappointing

* The score was totally forgettable (except the Black Panther pan pipes fuck yeah)

* The themes didn't feel significantly fleshed out or wrapped up, except for the one about vengeance, which was very well concluded with Black Panther

* The first fourty minutes lacks real momentum

* The actual consequences of this movie feel like they were trying to be as inoffensive as possible. As it stands it could go either way. Marvel could easily hand-wave them in the next film if they so choose, which I think was deliberate

Overall this was hugely enjoyable, the first Marvel film I have enjoyed in *so long*. I loved it.

d2vss3o,"Cool movie. I am not sure what I saw. It moved pretty fast going through a ton of material. But it felt like not a lot had happened. Also, the stakes were never as high as in the comic and they really didn't dig into the registration conflict. Which is fine I'm just saying it turned more personal at the end than a real civil war. 

The final fight was a bit over the top or maybe there was just so much action I got too used to it and it went by pretty quickly for me. Not enough Vision in the final fight which seemed weird. IDK. Since he could single handedly stop every single Avenger on Caps side by himself. Even Wanda. But I guess if he did we'd have no movie so there is your explanation. But it was a cool film. 

That said I hate that they wasted Crossbones and Baron Zemo. Hate it. Baron Zemo is an A-list Avengers villain and they criminally reduced him in this film. I don't know why Marvel mistreats its villains so much. 

I liked T'Challa and Spider-Man and they got just enough screen time and enough of a tease to set them up for their own movies. Especially Panther they absolutely nailed him completely. And Spidey looks like too much of a kid they need to age him just slightly. Antman was awesome too. I thought they would save that trick for Antman and the Wasp but they totally went there. It was crazy to see all those guys, especially Spidey playing in the same sandpit. I was like I can't believe what I'm seeing. Total nerdgasm. I like that they stayed truer to Wandas actual powers as opposed to being a Jean Grey clone like in AOU.

I agree with what a lot of people are saying. This movie would have been really awesome if Bucky had actually died. If you could really throw that wrench in there. But its Disney and breaking up the Avengers for real would be really bad for business. LOL. 

Overall 9/10 by superhero standards and a 7.5/10 as a film in general.

d2woo4q,"Enjoyed the movie, but my only major issue was how they basically set up all the conflict throughout the movie to set up the final scene between the 5 new Winter Soldiers vs whoever showed up for the good guys, only to completely ignore that threat once they got there.  I get that Zemo wanted to bring Iron Man/Cap/Winter soldier there so they would fight, but then all he did was show them a video and tell him his master plan and then they (Iron Man really) proceed to do exactly what he wanted them to do.  Seems like to me he could have saved a lot of trouble if he had just posted the video to youtube and sent Tony a link on Twitter or something.  It just seemed like alllll this setup for what basically amounted to ""hey, watch this video, now fight"".  Everything that happened before really didn't matter at all in the grand scheme of the plot of the movie.  Still was a lot of cool stuff though, but that part did feel like they had a much bigger ending fight planned and they had to cut it out at the last minute due to budget and/or timing issues.  

Edit: for the record, I did think the ending was better than just a 5v5randoms ""boss fight"" or whatever, but I didn't like how they basically had to throw away everything that had happened in the movie up until that point to get us there.  Like seriously, what was the point of the 5 winter soldiers at all?  ",4i35uf

The Peter and Tony scene was good, but felt like it shouldn't have been in this movie. It broke the flow of the movie for me. You should have his had him show up in the airport scene and it would have been fine.

I didn't think they needed to show Bucky killing the Starks three times. Honestly the beginning was a little weird in terms of the pace with that.

Villain is dumb. How did he know everything that he knew? How was able to infuriate a super secret base? Where did he get the resources? How did he do this all by himself? Why was plan so convoluted? I really hate that movie hinged all on this guy that we know so little about.

",4i35uf
d2wdj90,"So I just watched it and I feel slightly underwhelmed. But only slightly.                        
1. There was a lot of unneeded shots. In the beginning and in the end. Introduction of T'chaka was formulaic and his characters motivations were understandable but poorly built. I loved the chase scene. It was probably the most exciting scene in the entire movie, but mostly the Black Panther could have been done better. I'll say the same about Tony Stark as well. His motivations we at times weak and forced. They felt contrived at times, and despite good acting, Tony's role was a bit of a let down.                          
2. I think I speak for everyone when I say I was surprised at how much screen time Spidey had, it was good too but this again i felt was unrequired. It added to the unneccesary fluff.                                 
3. Ant Man was a nice addition, i liked how matter-of-factly he was introduced (this should have been the way the other new characters could have been introducted) but I felt the whole Super Large Ant Man bit was overdone and subsequently found it boring. Ultimately, it lowered the quality of an otherwise decent fight scene.                                    
4. Some of the fighting was silly. I'm sick and tired of stronger antagonists throwing a protagonist around instead of going for the kill. Civil War had this far far more than Winter Soldier and that was severely disappointing.                                           
5. The lack of a decent villain is understandable since Tony does such a great job of being that, but who are we kidding, we arent gonna really take Tony serious as a villain are we? Zemo had too little screen time and though formidable, his arc amounted to nothing. Merely a plot device for the rest of the story.                                
6. Also there were just too many characters. this I feel is something most people wont mind, but for me that meant too much time spent of lousy characters. I think the movie could have done without Vision and hawkeye.                                                
7. I still think terrence howard would have made a better Rhodes. i didnt like whatsisname at all and I still dont. the intensity Terry brings is totally lacking with whatsis.                                             
8. Now for the good. Half the action was stupifyingly awesome. Cap holding down the Copter, Bucky snatching the bike, Panther, him and cap chasing on foot and subsequently on wheels. Fucking exciting.                                                                
9.  Bucky is excellent. Love everything about him. As is Falcon. he had a good intro in Winter Soldier and he brings a lot to the movie. Most of all Cap. He is convincing and endearing. I loved him.

Above all else, Spider-Man is fantastic. Couldn't ask for anything better",4i35uf
d2uv3dc,"Positives

* Great fight scenes especially the ones with all of the superheroes involved
* Blank Panther was pretty cool
* RDJ, man he gave off a really good performance in this movie
* There are some hilarious moments in the movie, per usual of a Marvel film
* The Vision, I like him. I felt a connection there with him.
* The soundtrack especially during the big fight was very good, it gave off an epic but somewhat ominous feel. 
* Holy shit that Ant man transformation. I thought he was going to go full minituraized to the size of smaller than an atom but I could not have been more wrong.  

Negatives (more like nitpicking)

* Basically what other people have said about the villain. He was kind of underwhelming. Every time it switched from the Avengers to the Russians I was like pleeeease can we get back to RDJ and Chris Evans already...
* I felt like that airport scene edged a biiiiit too much on the humorous side. Specifically Spiderman he had some good lines but I think maybe there one or two too many. NBD. 
* RDJ discovering that Bucky killed his parents felt a biiiiiit too convenient of a plot device. It kind of reminded me of BvS how there happened to be camera footage of Aquaman, Flash with their logos displayed there just happened to be a surveillance camera that perfectly captured the footage and Bucky staring into it for a good 3 seconds before dramatically destroying it. RDJ's performance during that scene was heartbreaking though. 

Final thoughts. While I think the movie is very good, I don't think it takes the place of best superhero movie of all time like I have seen some reviewers on youtube have been saying. The Russo brothers had to do so much in the movie and masterfully achieved many of them but there were cracks that took me out of it. A movie like Iron Man which was a cohesive great experience from start to finish IMO is better but Civil War is definitely up there. 

Would recommend watching, as if people really need recommendations though haha.

d2uy9fd,"I loved this movie, I gave it a 9.5/10. I took .5 off because of the horrible Iron Man/Tony Stark CGI. 
IMO, the pace of the movie is what made this movie. It wasn't like BvS where the first half is a snooze fest then the 2nd half was explosions and fights all in your face. 
  
I loved Black Panther and Spidey. I kind of felt uneasy for finding Aunt May attractive lol. The airport fight was just pure awesomeness, I wanted more! Ant-man going Giant-man is so underrated lol. 
  
One thing that would've made this movie even more memorable is if they ""killed"" off Steve and end the movie with Bucky picking up the shield or something.

d2viqej,"Yesterday night I embarked on my first showing of Captain America Civil War opting for the AMC Prime experience in Los Angeles. 

Today I'm watching again in IMAX 3D at THE CHINESE THEATER then Saturday at THE DOME - Arclight Hollywood. Needless to say, I'm stoked for repeat viewings.

Pros:

- Chadwich Boseman as The Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spidey-Man. This is pitch perfect casting to the tee as both actors were able to portray every nuance of the characters that allow them to shine on screen. From the regal poise and conviction of T'Challa to Spidey's innocence and quips, these two were perfect additions to the Marvel Universe that never felt forced
- Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans were on another level in this movie. Their two characters have so much history being displayed across the many movies and tv shows that Marvel has to offer and this was the boiling point of all that build up. The reveal at the end lended an incredible amount of weight to the final fight scene.
- The Humor! Despite how sad and serious the movie may have gotten the comedic moments from Anthony Mackie, Paul Rudd, Jeremy Renner, Robert Downey Jr, and even some moments from Sebastion Stan kept this from being depressing. Tom Holland included as well
- BLACK WIDOW! What else does she need to do to get a solo movie? She was incredible in the scenes against crossbones men especially during the moment she was thrown inside a tank with a grenade being dropped into it.
- Vision's conversation with Scarlet Witch about power and the infinity stone was also a quiet moment that I enjoyed
- Did I mention Black Panther yet? :)
- THE AIRPORT SCENE > Spider Man 2 Train scene. Come at me.
- Absolute mastery at the balance of so many characters in one movie. DC can't even do 3 and provide half as great of a balance

Cons:

- Zemo story was kind of weak
- Was overloaded by the amount of action in the beginning scenes

d2vlztc,"This will probably get buried- but ONE kinda major thing bugged me in an otherwise amazing movie.

Tony’s whole thing in the movie is that “enhanced humans” and the Avengers need to be held in check and sign this treaty thing.. So when he recruits Spider-Man… wouldn’t he have got him to sign the treaty as well if he’s going to fight with the Avengers?

If he did, wouldn’t that completely reveal Peter Parker’s secret identity to the world, or at the very least the United Nations? But one of his main points for recruiting him was that he was teasingly threatening to reveal his identity.

And if he didn’t get Spidey to sign it… wouldn’t that mean he was going “off the record” and recruiting an enhanced human without any oversight? Exactly what he was pushing to stop?

",4i35uf
d2vpf9z,"I cant believe they killed Crossbones, in the comics I thought he was a great villian for Cap, almost matches his skills but outmatches Cap in ruthlessness, I was hoping he would end up working for Zemo",4i35uf
d2w46rq,"I really liked this movie, but the CGI put me off at times heavily. Whenever someone would jump off a building or do any sort of jump, there would be this blurry cgi which doesn't make the person look human. Or the 3 man Chase scene in the highway. It looked bad IMO compared to other fight scenes like the team red vs blue fight. Also the twist in the end was given off by Tony's reaction when he says ""I remember this place it's familiar"". I dunno if I was the only One but I made the connection to the recurrence of that scene with his reaction on the topic of his parents death. Good movie on explaining everyone's motives tho!",4i35uf
d2wwc8y,"I thought it was great but I have a few minor nick picks:

* How come Spiderman didn't know what they were fighting about. Why didn't he ask?

* How did Iron Man know Cap was at the airport?

* Why did they have to  get a specific aircraft to go to Siberia?

* ~~The submerged prison in the middle of the ocean was kind of unrealistic.~~ Nevermind. It's a world with massive hovercraft, A.I, and tons of other stuff. This wasn't too big of a stretch.

* I've heard that the comic book also shares the flaw but the fact of the matter is that Tony comes off as completely unlikable and it's clear that Cap is right. Sure, he has a great character arc and has justifiable reasons but he comes of as a complete asshole, imprisoning Scarlet Witch and trying to kill Bucky after finding out he killed his parents. His position is just indefensible.

* Martin Freeman's scene with Zemo was cliche. If you get out of line, I'll punish you. Please get out of line.

* The entire ordeal could have been solved so easily if when they were at the airport, Tony just let Steve explain the thing about Helmut Zemo and his reasons, but I guess that a relatively forced battle was more fun. After just a few seconds, he just says enough and calls Spiderman. Zemo's plan in general was a bit too long-winded.

* The Ant-Man movie established that Ant-Man's mass stays the same when he gets smaller and thus he has the same strength but it's just more concentrated. So if he has the same strength, how come when he's big, he can create dents in airplanes and whatnot.

* Captain America didn't actually know that Bucky killed Tony's parents. In the last movie, Zola simply explains that Hydra has killed people and one of the pictures is of Howard Stark. That's it.

* Wasn't the Winter Soldier supposed to be super covert and elusive. Why then did he just shoot Howard Stark in the middle of a road with cameras. Howard Stark was believed to have died due to the car accident but wouldn't the bullet hole make it clear that he was murdered? ",4i35uf

d2ux4p2,"Marvel can have around 12 characters, give each of them enough development where you enjoy the character. DC has 3 characters and can barely give them all an arc. Bless Marvel",4i35uf
d2uxe09,"For me this was up there with The Dark Knight in terms of quality comic book films.

One thing I'll say is that I found it thoroughly impressive how they managed to get so many characters in, yet not make the plot feel convoluted. Everyone got their moments and motivations to participate in the fight. This truly was 'superheroes vs superheroes' done right. And the funny thing is, even though I quite enjoyed Batman v Superman, this film made me dislike it a bit more as it indirectly pointing out some more flaws in BvS. 

Ok one more thing: Black Panther and Spidey were fantastic, and I can't wait to see their solo films.  

EDIT: Oh dear, the DC downvoting-fanboys are here. I never said BvS was a bad film, calm down. ",4i35uf
d2v640a,"Saw it. Really well done movie. +Well done to the Russo Bros.
Things I liked,

* Cap & Falcon Bromance - Yes

* the look Bucky and Wilson gave Steve after he kissed Sharon. Everyone was laughing.
* Cap holding that chopper - Man the whole theater was going oooh.
* Spidey was done so well. And I was so worried about it.
* Ant Man - yes. And that new feature ;)
* mix of seriousness, action, levity.
* the end credits where they add a shadow, that's relevant to the character, to every actor.

What I did not like,

* Casting Marissa Tomei as Aunt May. She's just too hot to play that role. Her scenes with Tony felt like sexy banter and the bedroom scene with Peter was more towards the icky side.  No fault of Marissa that shes good looking.

* Zemo tries to off himself? WHY?
* I like Vision trying to adjust, but DO NOT like the Wanda shipping.
* Steve kissing Sharon needed a bit more build up.

Also, I thought Tony would be an ass from what I saw in the trailers, but they really presented both sides well.",4i35uf

d2uy6a2,I was underwhelmed. Also Alamo Drafthouse is not a great theater IMO if you want to enjoy a movie.,4i35uf
d2wrqea,"While I greatly enjoyed the movie, I couldn't help but see so many similarities between it and BvS, which Civil War only did slightly better.

Both sides had different ideals but needed a puppet-master type villain to pull the strings that resulted in the confrontations. Civil War did this slightly better because Zemo's motivations were much clearer than Lex's. Civil War also showed the opposing viewpoints of TeamCap and TeamIronMan better because the difference in opinions was better handled than how it was done between Superman and Batman.

One thing that bothers me though is how BvS was ripped to shreds over the whole ""Martha?"" scene but Tony going off the rails after seeing his parents die is okay. Both moments are foreshadowed throughout the movie. Bruce with his nightmares. Tony at the beginning with the memory projection and the flashback of the actual crash. I know Tony's was a lot more real cause Bucky was right next to him when he found out. Also, both had different effects. Tony finding out about his parents being killed snapped him from being rational to going into a rampage. Bruce's snapped him from being on a rampage to becoming rational.

I enjoyed Civil War a bit more than BvS. It handled it's runtime much more efficiently. Giving that many characters their due while BvS had trouble with just two. The arguments for each sides ideals was handled much better. Spider-man's cameo was better than Wonder Woman in my opinion. I also say that the airport fight was a better battle royale than the Trinity vs. Doomsday battle. But I will say I liked the Batman vs. Superman battle more that Iron Man vs. Bucky and Captain America.

Otherwise, great film.  Possibly the best of the MCU.  Seen it three times now.  I love how the villain actually wins as the Avengers are broken up at the end.  And that he's just a person who was legitimately harmed by their actions.  Thought the introductions of BP and Spidey were done well as well.

Very fun to watch and provided a decent balance of characters without overdosing the film to death (something I was wary about going in). I'd definitely put it with Guardians of the Galaxy, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man as my favs. 


I'll say this though, and this is more in addendum to the entire concept and execution of every Marvel film, but pertaining directly from the emotions coming out of Civil War: I feel absolutely nothing when I watch these films anymore. 

Granted, we've all accepted, at this point, that Marvel and Disney are in the ""We're in the Money"" mindset with these films, and that's no fucking surprise whatsoever. However, that doesn't mean the film cannot pack an emotional punch every now and then, and I don't mean this in terms of the performances and writing. If anything, the performances in this film were really solid and writing was good. But when I tell you that I am sick and tired of little to no intentional camera work and dynamic, visual storytelling to truly get my amp going deep down inside from the moment my eyes watch the screen, I really mean it. These films are so STALE when it comes to direction and cinematography that it's driving me up the wall. A film is a visual medium of art, utilizing the camera to convey aspects of story, empathy, and development. When the camera is literally just sitting there the whole film without any tricks of its sleeve (and I use that term sparingly and vaguely for reasons to not be tacky and cliche), you are actually telling me I should not care at all. 

And that is what is seriously holding these films back for me, I just do not get excited when they start coming out anymore. I even read the Civil War story arch years ago and by the time I heard this was coming out (after years of Marvel films finally did me in), I barely even cared. Guess that worked out in my favor, considering my low expectations made me enjoy this movie even more at the outset of its action sequences.

Everything from the introduction to Peter Parker to the end of the airport fight scene was amazing.  I hated the Ant-Man movie, but fuck he was amazing in this.  It was fucking perfect, it was beautiful.  God damn best part of the movie by far. 

Everything before that was total shit, though.  It felt like it was made by a completely different director.  Tony's motivations make no logical sense, the camera was either boring static shots or so extreme in its shaky cam that you can't make out what's going on, and the editing felt off.

The action stuff after the airport scene was just as good as the stuff in the airport scene, but the motivation behind it was pretty fucking stupid.

The fight scenes were a nice mix of fast paced action for the ""fighting normal dudes"" parts and then larger than life action for the superhero vs superhero parts.

The worst part was that this really shouldn't have been called a ""Captain America"" movie it should have been just ""Civil War"" or ""Avengers: Civil War"". Cap was annoying dense in this film, yes he was WRITTEN to be the main character, that was clear, but, as I feared, Chris Evans was just simply out acted by RDJ. Yes Tony has an emotional story, but he also was the 2ND main character in a movie that felt like it was written for one main character. At the end of the day though, it felt like a captain america more in terms of action and pacing which I liked.

The best part was that it was very mortal. Yes ant-man got huge, there are iron-man suits and super soldiers, and Vision and Wanda have real super human powers, but nothing felt insanely unfair for one side or the other. Hell, even the bad guy was an average dude, he just wanted revenge.

 Also both Wanda and Vison had their powers humanized which was super important because they were the 2 real ""super humans"" that had powers in battle beyond being strong or being in a suit. By having them accidentally hurt people, it made them and the movie feel more real. It's because of that I'm REALLY glad both Hulk and Thor were left out, it would no longer be a fight, they could just fuck up everyone, it wouldn't feel ""captain america"" They need villains on pat with them, not on par with Cap and Tony.",4i35uf
d2ux0wt,"Loved: Felt like a corrective to Age of Ultron. Also you can have an intense, scary final battle without entire cities becoming rubble and trash. I know nobody liked Daniel Bruhl's villain, but I liked that he is just an average guy with a world destroying grudge. His last scene was pretty great.

Hated: RESET! Nothing that happened in this film is irreversible, hell the final apology letter and the look on Iron Man's face says that he and Cap will be more frenemies than nemesis (nemesi???). They even put The Winter Soldier back in the fridge, so even he can be in play if needed again. There will be some more sniping about it in the future when they find themselves in the same room, but thats it. Few new characters were introduced, there was some more conflict, but this is as far their infighting goes. Some rough-housing but nothing that will leave any marks. ",4i35uf
d2v2dea,Had a lot of fun watching this but can't say it was perfect. Did anyone else think that the build up to the initial conflict between Captain America ans Ironman was rather weak? ,4i35uf
d2v2rpa,"So, I love the movie. But, I'm not very bright - or maybe I missed it. But, how did Stark know that Spider Man's true identity?  It felt forced to me, but I was hoping it was because I missed something. Thanks.",4i35uf
d2vbwwj,"Wasn't anything like the comics, but i guess the Superhero Registration Act doesn't really work when everyone's identity is already publicly known. Spiderman was really important because he revealed his identity on TV, but in the movie he's in high school AGAIN. And this would've been the perfect opportunity to kill off Cap like in the comics.",4i35uf
d2votwr,"I hate the cinematography of Russo Brothers.
They're great with character development, and a very good with fight scenes, but god damn every battle took place where the background was horrible grey.
The only great shot was Cap standing in the church, that was GOAT-level fantastic, but everything else is just grey. That's the same problem as in Winter Soldier too.
This was a good movie though, a solid 8/10",4i35uf
d2w3dvk,"Haven't seen anyone comment that William Hurt's character is the same Thunderbolt Ross from the 2008 Incredible Hulk movie... great continuity. 

I wonder if Marvel will do THUNDERBOLTS which is their version of Suicide Squad.. bad guys working for the gov't. Some of those comics are pretty amazing. ",4i35uf
d2wzfke,"I feel like Black Panther was being hypocritical when he stopped Zemo from killing himself. He said he was done with vengeance, but instead of letting Zemo end his suffering (honestly - his life is miserably wretched), Black Panther stopped the shot not to save Zemo but because ""the living weren't done with him yet"". That seems pretty F-ing vengeful. ""Wait, you can't die yet, you need to be punished and suffer more"". ",4i35uf
d2vrix2,"I found the first half to be much weaker compared to the second half. Especially the action sequences. It went from shaky cam with a LOT of cuts to action that was more reminiscent of TWS. I think the turning point was the Bucky and Cap silhouetted fight right after Zemo reactivated him.  

 While I enjoyed the second half and conclusion more, I felt like Cap and Bucky going for Tony's arc reactor would have had much more of an impact if his life still depended on it. Like Cap smashing it but making sure it didn't deactivate completely. It lacked the intensity that they were going for, for me.
Bucky killing Tony's parents was really predictable as well. 
I really liked the new Spidey (even if the web swinging scenes weren't as epic as I wanted them to be). 
I'm disappointed but maybe I might like it better after a rewatch at a later date. ",4i35uf
d2vtqdl,"Went into this movie hearing rave reviews about Black Panther, Spider-Man and Ant-Man.  Spider-Man and Ant-Man delivered.  I have no idea why people liked Black Panther so much.  

He seems to be just below Captain America and The Winter Soldier as far as strength and speed and he has claws.  Also he is a prince/king.  Other than that I didn't see anything at all that distinguished him from all of the other heroes going to town on each other.  ",4i35uf
d2xh9rr,"I actually didn't like it as much. Yeah, it's a good movie and has great comedy as usual. But, it's not new, not any step forward for Marvel. The movie just felt like an average Marvel movie formula that they refuse to change. The first part up to Spider-Man was the SLOWEST part of a movie ever. And Crossbones was just a lame cheap trick to start the movie. And that event never is really a catalyst for the rest of the movie. Everyone is mad at the Avengers for Sokovia and Black Panther wants Bucky dead because Bucky killed his father. The bio weapon in the beginning made no impact on the movie. It just wasn't what I expected. Nobody important was sacrificed or killed. They had the oerfect story to use in Civil War and decided on an easy route so they can keep their characters for the next meet up. ",4i35uf
d2x9hn1,"I kinda wish someone died. I don't know who, but I feel like the stakes need to be raised. ",4i35uf
d2xazty,"What I still don't understand is how the hell would allowing the UN to take months to decide on a crisis be better than the Avengers just making the decision. And why everyone is so pissed of at the Avengers for saving the day and having a few people die? If I was Stark and that woman came up to me bitching and moaning about her son, I would have just yelled at her ""dumb bitch, if we did nothing, EVERYONE WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD MULTIPLE TIMES OVER"" ... I understand it was necessary for the plot, but god did it lack and logic or reasoning... 

Character driven movies > plot driven movies",4i35uf
d2ve457,"When Black Panther got caught, Falc asked him ""so you like cats?""

So why didn't ask Ant-man ""so you like ants?""

Then spiderman, ""so you like spiders?""

He could have also asked Bucky, ""so you like winter?"" Or Vision, ""so you like seeing stuff?""

If anyone asked him if he liked birds, obviously he does! ",4i35uf

d2unngg,"I just got out of the first showing at a local theater.  Even knowing spoilers from here did not make it any less epic.  Hell, I was even more impressed with things like the airport scene which was even cooler than what people made it out to be.  ",4i35uf
d2unof4,"I think one of my favorite parts of this movie, besides, of course, Spider-Man, Ant/Giant-Man and all the awesome little things throughout, was the villain and its relatively small scale. They made us think that Zemo was going to be another cookie-cutter villain bent on world destruction. The team of super soldier assassins was an amazing red herring/bait and switch; I thought for sure the final fight would be Tony, Black Panther, Bucky and Cap versus them. But oh man the moment Cap and Bucky stepped in and found the super-soldiers already dead was when I really realized just how unpredictable, calculating and manipulative Zemo really was, I'd even say more than Loki. He orchestrated all of this just to drive a wedge deep within the Avengers, and he undoubtedly partially succeeded, more so than most MCU villains. 

And because of that, unlike most other MCU films, which often end up tying themselves in a neat little bow, we really don't know where the Avengers, Cap, and Tony go from here. ",4i35uf

d2unrlq,"I really enjoyed this film, especially when they got the comic cover shot. But even more than that, I loved that the characters seemed fleshed out, at the very least you could tell they were making emotionally weighted decisions. 

My one complaint is having Peggy deliver Cap's [line](http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p388/proteus_lives/Scan10963.jpg) (which is really Mark Twain) via Sharon's eulogy. However, it fit the scene, was rather beautiful, maybe plausible something Cap would have said to her off screen in the MCU, and drove his motivation in his decision at that point. It was very well done, and I understand it being used in that way, but I had really hoped to see him deliver it. It's far form having Hermione always deliver Ron or Dumbledore's lines to Harry in the films. ",4i35uf
d2uns1j,"The movie was great and I had a blast watching it. I didn't like the need for miscommunication to drive the story. This team has been working together for a while and all of a sudden cease listening to each other. Tony was too willing to let the government control the heroes without limitations. Cap decided the one person who would never be able to publicly be an Avenger was worth bringing the ship down for. And there was a camera, mysteriously, where the Winter Soldier killed the Starks. So much for no witnesses. And Tony, upon seeing the footage loses all sense of reason as one of the smartest people alive. These are the initial thoughts on what I didn't like. 

Loved everything else. For how expansive the cast was, there was never a moment It was too much. Also, Cap should have sent Tony a phone charger too.",4i35uf

The characters are all amazing, for the most part. I loved Spider-Man and Black Panther. Like watching Cap step outside the law to get things done (what's more American than that?). Zemo is probably one of the most compelling villains the movie MCU has put out so far

Has some plot flaws, Spider-Man is really shoe horned in, Tony's character is a little uneven (haven't decided if that's just how it should be naturally or if the writing is off there).

Both sides leading up to the airport fight spend a day recruiting, instead of just moving. It seemed just a little odd to me that everything ground to a halt so they could pad out their rosters. I mean it kind of makes sense. Cap calls Hawkeye, who goes to get Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man. But then why would Cap, Falcon, and Bucky stay in Vienna and wait for them? Instead of moving out of where they know the governments are looking for them?

Overall realy enojoyed the movie and would to watch it again, but can't afford to waste the money.

But the problem i had with the movie was just how...overpowered Captain America was. Just like spiderman said his shield doesn't follow the laws of physics (or something like that). 

Two scenes pissed me off the most. First is the Cap pulling down the helicopter, that thing could carry like what, 8 people? And somehow 1 person in the heli + 1 person holding on to it pulls it back down to the ground.

Second one is close to the end, when Iron man tries to fly towards Bucky and Captain...just standing on the ground not holding on to anything completely stops Iron man who's flying past him. That just makes no sense.

And overall Stark's team, not counting Scarlet Witch, should have absolutely destroy Cap's team. When the fight at the airport started i thought to myself ""This is just a 4v1 and everyone else is irrelevant""

Cap and Bucky's escape from the apartment complex and eventual tunnel chase was superb. 

Black Panther was really cool. I immediately felt for him following the explosion and wanted to see how he grew and eventually he realized what vengeance was doing to everything and everyone around him. 

I really liked how the movie progressed. Talking, action, talking, action, talking, action. You had Bucky and the brain-washer followed by the Lagos scene. Then it's Stark and the woman at the elevator followed by the Lagos aftermath and then Bucky escaping with Rogers and so on and so forth. It felt like it was paced quite well. There wasn't an action overload and the gaps occurred where they had to. 


I really liked how this movie wasn't ""Ah, shit. Big Ben, Eiffel Tower, Empire State Building are under attack. The world is ending again! Who will stop them?!?!"" 

There was like three trailers before this movie that were all ""Da world is ending? Who steps up to the plate? Big turtles, the military and mutants!"" 

It was refreshing that we were seeing the heroes have to answer for their actions and everyone had their struggle (Wanda: bombing, Vision: Existential crisis, Hawkeye: Retirement and life after, Rogers: Bucky, Bucky: Who am I?, Black Widow: looking for stability, Stark: Accountability (for his decisions and the team's and pretty much feeling responsible for everything wrong that happens in his life) *probably could tweak some* 

Spiderman....

I'm a huge Spidey fan. Sam Raimi's first installment was brilliant and it quickly became my favorite movie. The second one was superb, but were followed by three disappointments. 

I'm very excited for for Spider Man Homecoming. Aunt May is hot. There will be no ""Origin"", and we are going to see young Spidey in high school learning the ropes and juggling his life and Spider-Man's. 
Even though he was in this movie for a smallish portion, they made the most of it and left us wanting more. 

Antman was awesome. His starstruck moment, his diversion and his raft prison moment. 

Olson's accent came and went I thought, but dem tittays were A1 the whole time. 

This was better than AoU without a doubt and may be my favorite film of this whole saga. Definitely going to buy this when it comes out on Blu Ray. 



I'll be truthful, I haven't followed the MCU to the letter. Going into this I've only seen Ironman 1 & 3, Cap 1, Antman, Avengers 1 & 2 and the first half of CAWS. I wasn't confused or anything like that and felt like I knew everything I had to and went in expecting a popcorn flick and got so much more. My only wish going into this movie was ""don't fuck up spidey"" and they didn't fuck up and made a spectacular film. 

Gonna be tough to top this for me in term's of ""Best Summer flick of MMXVI"" 

New Bourne movie might give it a run for it's money...I doubt the new Xmen film will come close. ",4i35uf
d31132o,"Loved the movie, but I have a question. Tony questions why Hawkeye would join the fight (which from his perspective, Cap just told him he needed him to stop Tony and gang from arresting him and Bucky so they could get away?) because of his family, and he's kind of right. I know he gets out at the end (but they're all kind of fugitives now, right?), but he was in a prison at sea without his family. For that matter, Tony didn't really seem to care that all of those basically innocent avengers were locked up ",4i35uf

d318svz,"I loved it but I would have been much happier if Captain surrendered himself to save the lives of others, similar to how the comic ended. That would have been a more satisfying ending for me showing Cap taking a bullet for the others (metaphorically). 

It would allow T'Challa to help Buckey himself, leave an impression on Tony referring back to the comment Cap makes to Tony in Avengers ""You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you."" and also leave it open to when shit hits the fan Tony will have to break Cap out of jail to reunite the Avengers.

Outside of that I really enjoyed the movie, the characters difference of opinions, their actions and the events caused by them felt organic and clear, not convoluted and vague. The fight scenes, whilst grand at times didn't feel like a blender of CGI and loud noises.  The final fight was great especially after all the events and explosions that occurred beforehand that final fight was filled with emotion and I really go into it rooting for Captain America.

Except the Sarcovia Accords.  I mean, granted Age of Ultron was all Tony's fault.  But with The Avengers  the Chitari would have taken over the planet.

Great acting, through out the entire movie by him, and it really made me feel for him. Really enjoyed Black Panther's intro, and a nice set-up for his movie. Spider-man is adorable. The only thing I felt was forced was Vision and Wanda. Or rather Vision liking Wanda. Yes I know they get together in the comics. I think it's because there doesn't seem much chemistry with the actors I guess. Kind of wish they just approached this as they find each other interesting, instead of Vision has a crush on her and doesn't know why.

Black Panther and Spiderman's introductions were great both characters fit in perfectly with this world , but for Ant Man stole the show when he turned into Giant Man. I new Spidey and Black Panther were in the movie which got me excited but it would made an awesome surprise, and because I wasn't excepting Giant Man is why my nerd brain was blown off my shoulders. My favorite fight was Hawkeye Vs Vision I loved the line I new I should have stretched, and then vision phasing through the attacks was so cool. Ok I did see one flaw in the movie and I think i'll get some hate for mentioning this, but reddit is for opions and cute pets. So they really made Vision a dick. Every time the plot needed something bad to happen they just decided to put it on Vision which annoyed me. He was so great In Age of Ultron and seen as this peaceful god like being. I would have been happy if when the fighting started he would have probably decided to go rogue like Hulk. Him holding Wanda against her will i thought was so out of character from the age of Ultron Vision. Last thing everybody's performances were amazing probably the best acting in any marvel movie, but who wins the award for most improvement was Elizabeth Olsen her acting was so much better in this than Age of Ultron (not that it was bad in that), you could tell she was giving it her all.

- Attack the UN meeting in Vienna. Disguise himself as Barnes and somehow release a photo of himself standing next to the bomb van, so everyone will search for Bucky and eventually capture him.

- Once Bucky is captured, kill the psychiatrist assigned to him and take his place. Cause a power outage in the building so that Bucky will be able to escape. Then trigger him using the code words.

- Ask him where the 5 super-soldiers are. Go to Siberia and kill them.

- And then...wait for whichever Avengers to show up? He didn't know who would survive the airport and/or who would want to or be allowed to go to Siberia.

- Show Stark (if he's there!) the video of his parents being murdered. I guess the tape was in Siberia? Because if Zemo had it all along, he could have just sent Stark a link on YouTube.

They try to make the audience care about characters that we've never been given a reason to care about before. The reasons given for the Sokovia Accords are laughable, one explosion after years of destruction and now the Avengers must be put in place? And then the Avengers fight and it just feels like a joke.

The death of Tony's parents should've happened earlier in the movie to give Tony a real reason to fight Cap. Almost turning Tony into a vengeful villain. Then you have him recruiting other people, like Spider-Man, using them to get his hands on Bucky.

The movie just felt like filler to a pay off that will never come, unless they're planning on doing the Dark Avengers which is unlikely. The whole Civil War angle just felt wasted. It wasn't a War, it was two fights.

Points that I did like:

*  Ant-Man and Spiderman were funny.
*  The fight between Cap/Bucky/Ironman at the end was great. Although Tony shooting off Winter Soldier's arm doesn't make any sense when the arm is made of Vibranium just like Cap's shield and Cap's shield is indestructible.",4i35uf
d2w2zhg,"I think cap and tony's reasoning before the end for fighting so hard was a little shaky. Like yeah they disagree on signing the shit but to go at each other full force over it? Ehh...

That was always gonna happen though, they made it as reasonable as possible I think to have these guys get to such a dire point in just 1 movie.

Spiderman was the shit. I just wished he fucked them all up more. Bucky and his arm through the last two CAP movies is shown to be such a huge threat, and spidey just stops it one handed and makes a joke. 

Thats actually the only thing that bothers me with these films. I get why everyone needs to kind of cancel each other out for movies sake but it doesnt make much sense. Based on what we had seen an iron man missile or spider man punch would fucking annihilate bucky and cap. Or a bucky punch would kill black widow or an un armored tony, and unless Hulk or Thor are there whatever Vision says goes.  Black widow and hawkeye should remain in the background doing spy shit and only combating with people. Out there with spiderman, iron man, cap... they should be dead. 


I get why they have to make thor and hulk references but I feel like it should be only once. After a few you start expecting them and its just like rubbing it in your face. I knew it wouldn't happen but when iron man is like ""if anyone on our side has any special hidden super effective abilities..."" I was hoping thors hammer would just knock ant man down.

Really liked this guy's character, as he had an actual motive and wasn't wearing a costume, however it really is one hell of a convoluted plan! Instead of doing the bombing or in fact instead of doing any of his actions (killing a CIA psychologist in his hotel room, bombing a UN summit, luring them all to a siberian base, killing 5 winter soldiers in their 'sleep') he could have just emailed Tony Stark a video of Bucky killing his parents. We know he is amazing on computers as he decrypted the HYDRA files... I suppose then we wouldn't have met the panther guy and the spider dude.

**pros**

-Using incredible fight choreography for each fight was incredible. No motion is wasted or look wonky for any characters. Truly felt like each characters were the superheroes they are meant to be

-Incredibly snappy dialogue. Just like with the action, no words are wasted. There is no fluff with the dialogue in this movie. Even comedic one liners expound into the lore r situation. Impressive stuff.

**could be better**

-Fight scenes are spread out very unevenly. After the flurry of action in the first scene, it takes forever until the Bucky chase. And after that, it takes forever until the Airport battle. I can see why it makes sense to build up the drama. But it felt a little heavy towards the end while the middle of the movie felt a tad too low key.

-The other Winter Soldiers were teased but we didn't get to see them in action in the modern world. I can see why Zemo killed them. But I think it would have made sense if Zemo decided to unleash them too.

-Could be a bit too dark for kids. I kind of worry seeing very little kids watching this movie because a lot of scenes are dark even for adult viewers. From the dour tone to the politics to brutal deaths, this movie doesn't seem like it caters to young kids at all. Not a real flaw. But I  see many families brought young kids to this one.

All in all, the movie was even more of a political thriller than Winter Soldier while the action and comedy high points was the best Marvel films has been yet. On paper, it sounds like a risky combination, but it worked very well. Big props to the Russo brothers for making this work.",4i35uf

d2xucro,"As much as I loved this movie, it's an Avengers movie not a Captain America movie. Maybe any movie carrying the Captain America prefix in the Marvel universe just means it's kind of a Film Noir.",4i35uf
d2unqsz,"I know it's probably cheap of me to do this, but considering the similarities between the two films, I can't help but compare BvS and Civil War. Personally, I loved BvS, I watched it twice in theaters and both times I had a blast. However, considering the similar elements between the two (introduction of new characters, hero vs hero fight, emotional core relating to death of the parents and most of all villain's plan to pit the heroes against each other), I can't help but feel Civil War did it better, and a big reason is the pre-established MCU. Unlike the Marvel films, BvS had no pre-existing mythology for the viewer to lean on, and so a lot of the comic book mythology went over the general audience's heads, I felt.




To compare the villains in the two films, Zemo definitely comes out on top. A lot of people say that Zemo was arguably the weaker aspect of the film, but I personally felt he was my favorite MCU movie villain because of how human he was but how he just wrecked the relationships between the Avengers. In BvS the character motivations were unclear in terms of why Luthor wanted Superman dead (before any of you say anything, I know, his dad treated him like shit so he got a complex related to hating anything more powerful than himself), but Zemo still had a much more clearly defined motivation to tear the Avengers apart. 




As for the whole dead parents aspect, I thought the Martha thing in BvS was pretty cool and I enjoyed it, but once again, thanks to the established MCU, we see Tony's anger at Bucky for killing his folks and we empathize with him much more. Overall BvS was a more ballsy movie in that it took risks with its characters (a Batman that kills, is mentally unstable, a superman who needs a hug every now and then, etc.), but Marvel just did it better, I felt. But that's just my two cents",4i35uf
d2unrk3,"Granted, I don't read the comics or anything so maybe I'm missing a huge part of the plot. However, it seems like there's too many films about superheroes fighting other superheroes. One of my favorite scenes in the movie had to be the airport fight scene, but even then I couldn't wrap my head around the fact that the Avengers were fighting… the Avengers. 

Also, why is there always a huge backlash against the heroes in these films? ""There was this giant mecca robot/Swedish god/etc. that destroyed the entire city, but how dare you kill my sweet little Billy instead of letting it kill more people?"" Don't get me wrong, I thought that the film was great, but it seems so overdone (or maybe it's because I saw Batman v. Superman a few weeks ago)",4i35uf

Hence Spider-man being completely CG during the airport scene. Yes, I know Ironman and War Machine are also completely CG as well, but slightly different. In some shots it looks like his model was dragged and dropped onto shot that wasn't supposed to have him in it. On top of that I'm not sure why he was even in the movie other than to probably serve as more fan-service and action figure source. In regards to canon, which is sort of thrown out the window when the film opts to use a document called the Sokovian Accords in favor of the SRA, Peter Parker's role is trivialized when he's introduced as some up and comer high school kid that Tony Stark discovered on YouTube, of which he also already knows his secret identity. One of the most if not THE most pivotal and iconic moments in the Civil War story arc is when Spider-Man reveals his secret identity as Peter Parker to the public when he joins team Ironman. Which, granted would have been hard to replicate when the movie doesn't even have the SRA in it. I'm not going to even start on Zemo. Anyway, enough of my bitching, like I said, canon complaints aside, I enjoyed it very much.

Dramatic tension from the school of Stephanie Meyer-- big battles promised (6 Winter Soldiers?!) and not delivered. Made one of the largest and most consequential comic arcs into an MMA match in Russia about a bit of backstory. And totally effed the comic trajectory, too. Rogers running around on the LAM? (Like that's new, after two) Bucky in cryo? What was the fucking point of any of this?",4i35uf
d2w1uka,"Alright, I'm gonna break up the circle-jerk. 

Spider-man was bad, and I can't understand what everyone finds so positive. 

Let's start from the beginning: I understand his being nervous around Stark, but if he were quick enough to identify Stark having a reason to be there besides his fictional ""grant"", he also wouldn't have been playing so nervous. 

Next: This genius who somehow found the funding to make these ridiculously high tech web shooters has to dumpster dive for a computer? What a terrible characterization of his nerd side. 

Third: What in God's name did they do to his dialogue? I'm a nineteen-year-old white male who could be identified as a nerd. Nobody would refer to Empire Strikes Back as ""that really old movie"". Everything he said made me cringe. Is this what Marvel thinks kids talk like? Especially an intelligent one?

Finally, I can't say this for certain because of how poorly he was written, but Holland wasn't doing a great job on delivery. Everything had the same tone and there was no inflection. Not everything had to be panicky and starstruck. 


Movie was great. Spider-man was a poorly done character only meant to cater, and it feels like a lot of you aren't seeing past the hype. Ant-man was true, organic humor. Black Panther was a real, valuable character. Spider-man was the worst thing I've seen Marvel do in a very long time. 

One last beef. Why was he 100% CGI? It looked bad. I understand his action shots being CGI (obviously), but why his standing shots? There was only one shot where his suit wasn't CGI. That's sad. They were flipping cars for practical effects, but couldn't put him in an actual suit.

Steve finally grew a brain during that ending credits scene when he finally clued in that maybe, just maybe they should try to fix what Hydra did.

The actual showdown feels stilted, and as long as it took to get to it, it doesn't feel like enough movie-world time has passed in order for there to be that much animosity among once close friends and brother-in-arms. The plot, and the character motivations are paper thin. The whole production has a half-baked feel to it.

And Spider-Man. Ugh. The character is just squeezed in. The idea that Stark is going to recruit some, what, 15 year old, who's only been doing his thing for 6 months to help him stop some of the world's mightiest heroes is just ridiculous. Stark's whole motivation in the film is that he's tired of seeing the causalities of those not directly involved in the Avenger's battles, and what does he do? He convinces a kid who's not even out of high school to risk his life in a battle that's not his own. Had they introduced Parker as someone who'd been around the block for a few years...was well known by the Avengers, and the like, it would have made far more sense, but this just seems like a way to shoehorn Spider-Man into a Marvel production, which is fine, but they definitely didn't think it through very well.

The final battle between Iron Man and Captain America/Winter Soldier was far far more dynamic than the airport fight. In fact, the final battle was really the best thing in the entire film (besides Black Panther, who was pretty cool), but by that point I was no longer invested.

The movie was long, mostly boring, action scenes were almost unreadable, the CGI was terrible...I'm just glad I didn't shell out the extra bucks to see it in 3D.

I liked that they started to dig in the relationship between Wanda and Vision, and also portraying Wanda as suceptible to depression. House of M/Decimation coming?

d2vpuur,"You know, I just gotta add a few critiques, I know I'm gonna get downvoted for that, who cares.
1.For a movie that's trying to be sad and a little darker than most MCU movies it has none impactful deaths, literally none. They didn't even kill War Machine, when there's absolutely no chance a human being survives that fall trapped in an iron suit. Even then, he loses his legs, which is a pretty good emotional moment, and then in the end he starts joking about it.
2.Constant joking throughout the airport scene took out any stakes and intensity out of it. Sure, the jokes were great, many awesome comedic moments, but that just wasn't good action.
3.The powers of all characters are not just changing from other movies, but it changes throughout the film. Vision is criminally underpowered, Stark is criminally underpowered.
4.What the hell was Scarlett doing? In every fight scene all she did was throw damn cars at everyone.
5.Vision/Scarlett romance is as forced as the hulk/widow one.
6.The cinematography can be described in one word - grey
7.Cap/Carter romance is as underdeveloped as the hulk/widow one.
8.Crossbones dies in the first 10 minutes of the movie. Smooth.
9.Stark's character change based of one death is laughable.
10.The Cap/Panther/Buck chase scene was so horrible with TV like effects and transitions to TV like stupid writing.
10. Fuck this, I really enjoyed it, but it has more flaws than any comic book movie in the last 5 years. Still great through, mostly based on the dynamics between the characters, action choreography, jokes and a good villain.",4i35uf

Spider man's dialog seemed forced and stilted, the CGI on him was jarring and he didn't seem to mesh with the other avengers at all.

d365f0x,"I did not enjoy the movie as much as I expected. I am actually very much surprised by this.

The editing was fine overall, the effects as well of course, but the plenty of characters were too much and the writing was too cheap at times. There were too many of those pesky necessary moments, where I thought that even with movie magic, that was the most stupid thing to do, but I knew they had written themselves intentionnaly as you need to move it forward in the direction you want/need to.

* What was it with the playful whitewashing overall? No undertones of all the women in the movie... and for the aspect of violence, especially in the potentially gritty scenes? E.g. at the airport, Ant-Man throwing a truck and then is ""sorry""? I'm pretty sure that's all Disney. There just was so much potential wasted in many scenes. Even the first and second Thor felt darker and grittier. 

* Total whitewashing with the resolution of the final fight.

* I once again had my problems with Chris Evans as Captain America. Imho he is just not as likable as RDJ/Tony Stark. Chris Evans can't seem to pull it off. It's crazy to say this, but I think Marvel knows this and so we saw Bucky/Winter Soldier and then Tony Stark in the first two scenes. Can't say why exactly, but RDJ's scenes were much more pivotal imho. They had much more depth and felt just bigger, better ... what have you.

* Really cheap and weird writing at times: Black Widow basically disappears during the fight, ultimately helps them... Tony is just pissed, apparently. The original cause for bringing the teams together is basically torn to pieces and gawking around corners at times. Although it is stressed that the true rift comes because of the actual ""terrorist"" being someone else than Bucky, it still is not satisfying.

* Why *exactly* did the fight at the airport?

At the end, I just felt like that I want another Iron Man movie, preferably made by Jon Favreau. Because when you go, *man, Black Widow and Tony Stark actually have history and share something... remember Iron Man 2 from 6 years ago?* for that one scene at the end and just manage a half-hearted smirk for the rest of the ending... hm.",4i35uf

d2y1n91,"This may draw alot of flak, but my intention is to bring to light real issues that people seem to be ignoring in their utter adoration of everything and anything Marvel.

Really thought this movie was bad. I mean, not just that it didn't live up to hype or wasn't as good as the other Marvel movies (Which I generally like), but seriously it was not a good movie. 

I liked Zemo, Black Panther and thought Paul Rudd killed the 20-30 lines he had in the movie, and I appreciated that for once I didn't really see where the movie was going, but that's basically it.

The fight scenes were lame and repetitive (which can be said for a lot of superhero fight scenes), there were no real stakes because anytime any of the Avengers were fighting one another it was more like a playful feud where all the B and C-list superheroes arbitrarily sided with Cap or Iron Man because ""fuck it why not just beat up these other superheroes I don't really know or care about for no reason other than I'm a superhero now and I guess this is what we do.""

Let's not forget that somehow everything goes according to Zemo's plan even though there is no way he could have predicted the outcome of a fight at an airport involving superheroes he has never even heard of miraculously ending up totally evenly matched, allowing Cap and Bucky to get away so that Iron Man could later find out that it was Zemo's ploy all along, decide to help Cap, follow after them all alone just to have a climactic and very boring and predictable showdown based on the one video clip that could have set Iron Man off at literally any time ever. 

Not that it has to make sense. It's a Superhero movie, I get that, and it's basically just supposed to be fun, BUT it failed to deliver on the action scenes, failed to build-up to any real emotional climax and ultimately relied on unbelievable and weakly fabricated tensions between two leading characters who resort to beating the living shit out of one another before even attempting to hear the other one out for more than a couple minutes. So much for the line about Tony and Cap being friends, they're more like teenagers who can't get along because of any inane little feud that they can't agree on. Needs some Hulk in this bitch just to put everyone in their place.

Was waiting for the reveal that the government was Hydra reborn all along using the superheros to force there agenda and wanting to control them because they wanted to be ready for Infinity war.

d2uvb0l,"I'm gonna get downvoted but whatever here are my thoughts.

Super. Super fun movie.  Antman was brilliant.  he was onscreen exactly when he needed to be and was a joy every second.  Spider man was a close second.  That middle fight scene was far and away the most fun I've had at a Marvel movie yet.  

My one giant grip is the bad guy.  
Things I liked, He was normal.  No powers, and not like a super chess wizard.  He was just a dude who had a goal and was going all out to complete it.  

Things I didn't like, his plan.  ok, so he wants to bring this empire down from within, so his plan is to first learn what happened on some super secret mission.  So he sends some friend of his to get a biotoxin, thus putting the Avengers in a tricky spot where they are going to fuck up.  

Then when the UN meets to decide what to do with the Avengers, he'll bomb the place to get to Bucky, so he can hopefully learn what happened on the mission AND that there was concrete proof  of the event.  Then he'll let Bucky loose to help him escape and hopefully drive Tony and cap apart. 
 
Then he leaves for some place (Russia I think? I'm bad at names) hoping that the Avengers will find him, AND that Tony will be with them. Then he kills these super solders because...? (I was relieved though, The movie was about to get really long!) And then he'll show Tony the proof, ON THE PRESUMPTION, that Tony doesn't know who killed his parents.  Tony could have known all along, come to terms with it, and this bad guy would have no idea.  Tony could have been keeping things hush hush in the public eye because he doesn't want to spill secrets like that to the public.

Iron Man was wrong, I get it, but he was right about the avengers needing a check and balance.  They have destroyed like 6 cities.  Those accords were limiting, but if they were in our universe, we sure as hell would want something to check them.

* Spider Man was shoe horned in and felt like unnecessary fan service and he was noticeably CGI for all of his scenes except the one scene where his mask came up halfway.

* Anti climactic ending

He could have just released the footage like on TV or something and stark and captain America would have fought over Buckley 

*Spider-Man in this is one of the most forced things I've ever seen. He has nothing to do with anything in the movie and his scenes serves no purpose. You could have cut him out, and the movie would have been exactly the same.

*lots of cringe quips. "" move your seat up"", ""I hate you"", the empire strikes back etc. really bad and cringey

*the much advertised airport scene was totally irrelevant and nonsensical. Where were all the people and airport security?

*didn't kill wrmachine when the plot impact called for it. Why? Because merchandising

*no stakes or consequences, everything is exactly the same at the start

*lazy ""you killed my father"" motivation for everyone

*incomprehensible CGi action that resembles people banging two toys together. No weight or Brutality behind any of it.

The first act is disjointed and unengaging, the second act is cartoonish and plastic, and the third one is emotionally sophomoric and the characters' motivations are incongruous. The 91% rating is ridiculous. This is an objectively mediocre movie.

d2xg9nc,"Overall, a great movie. I really loved the character development and character conflict, and thought it was really well-developed and executed. But, I did have a few problems with it.
First, Zemo. He felt pointless, to me at least. I get that this was supposed to be a movie about the two sides warring against each other, but he was still there and he was obviously meant to be portrayed as a main villain. But he didn't feel like a villain. You can't have a main antagonist in a movie where there are already two others (Cap's side and Tony's side.) I mainly just don't like how he was JUST a plot device. As I said, he was intended to be the main villain, but he was only there to frame Bucky and start the big fight near the end (Bucky and Cap VS. Stark). That's it. There wasn't anything significant about him in any way. In fact, I might have liked the movie more if all of this trouble and conflict was being caused by some unknown party, which would have been more menacing and... Villain-like, I guess. I mean, he had a motive and everything, but I just didn't care. It was basically the same as that one lady who's son had died at the beginning of the movie. ""The Avengers killed my (insert family member). Now I'm mad!"" I'll finish this paragraph with this; I didn't like how much screen time he had and how he was portrayed as this big, bad antagonist when he only did two important things (Blowing up the U.N meeting and showing Tony the video of Bucky killing his parents) and attempted to be villainous and menacing when the focus was clearly supposed to be on the two sides. He did his job well, but overall, he was really, really pointless other than that. They could have developed him more than that. Not a huge problem, but still silly and annoying.
Next, the comedy. I get it, it's one of Marvel's signature things, but they need to dial it down a little bit. It felt really out of place in this movie, mainly during the airport fight scene. It's really just silly that they would have this huge, action packed, and very comedic fight scene, then paralyze one of the main characters 2 minutes afterwards. The jokes were funny, but it also felt out of place and even disengaging from the movie at times. I don't mind and actually enjoy the small moments, like, ""Tony Stank"" and Ant-Man's first meeting with Cap and things like that, but a lot of times the transition between the comedy scenes and serious scenes is VERY rough. Overall, it's funny and lighthearted, but out of place.
Lastly, there was this small portion of the movie where it kind of drifted away from the actual storyline and focused more on the action, and felt like it was about to turn into typical Avengers story formula. That was the only, ""bad"" portion of the storyline for me.
And those were my complaints. This wasn't a full review, but I'll probably write one sometime soon. To finish this off, don't let these complaints steer you away from the movie. It's a really great movie, and this was just a discussion, and I said what I wanted to discuss. I hope you go see it and enjoy it.",4i35uf

- When do we learn anything about how Winter Soldier is turned on/off by trigger words? Was that completely new to Civil War or is it mentioned elsewhere? Why do they have to be read so slowly? Helmut was taking his sweet time reading them out while Bucky's smashing through his prison. What do they mean? Also is it water that makes him unbrainwashed?

- I thought Cap had killed Iron Man by slamming his shield into his core chest. But then he's alive and well immediately with no explanation how. How? Wasn't the core basically his new heart? Does it just stop his suit now?

- Where do you first learn about Black Panther?

Age of Ultron - Tony Stark thinks building ultron is the right thing to do because there are aliens out there and earth needs a powerful force to deter alien invaders. Ending conclusion: Tony was wrong, Tony farked it up and lots of bad consequences followed.

Civil War - Tony Stark thinks signing the sokovia accords is the right thing to do. Ending conclusion: Tony was wrong, Tony farked it up and lots of bad consequences followed.

It's like Harry Potter when I never saw the first one I just couldn't get into it and thus missed the next 5 or 6. I did see Batman V Superman but mostly for batman as I think the new superman is awful and really a very dry boring actor. Not only that but funny enough I was 13 or so watching Chris Evans play a fantastic Four character and have never been able to get over that jump from the fire guy to captain America.

This is the real appeal of these movies for me at the point. As much as I love superpowers and cool action sequences, I'm mostly in it for the story-craft Disney is able to serve up. This film, Avengers, Winter Soldier, the first Iron Man, and all of the others to lesser and varying extents (with the exception of IM2 and maybe a Thor movie or two) -- they are all incredibly tight scripts, especially for being big-budget adaptations of totally fantastical source material. Watching these movies is like watching someone perform improbable feats of strength. To make this good of a movie out of that many far-flung plot elements, it's just a joy to watch.",4i35uf

But, I have to disagree.The dialogue and the scenes themselves were so time effective that yea, the movie never felt bloated and moved quickly. But at the same time, did it ever feel too quick and too effective? Maybe it's because after watching Daredevil and JJ, I expected more subtlety and pacing from the MCU but everything felt so rapid and efficient that I barely felt connected to the plot and the characters. It was only in the last twenty minutes that I finally felt drawn in. But the first two hours...it seemed more like a montage of moments that were necessary rather than a flow of natural events.That being said, I loved the movie and definitely consider it to be one of the best MCU films.

But since Iron Man 1, he sees all these powerful people (from Earth or other universes) and realised how powerless he is to protect the world. With that, the cockiness starts to fade away. That led to Ultron, but also the realisation that some authority and oversight can help separate them from the bad guys when it comes to collateral damage.

d2usbca,"The punchy, hero-y stuff was definitely there in full, but it was supplemented by personal drives each character had and it really showed off why people care so deeply for comic heroes and their stories. I feel these MCU movies are getting deeper and deeper into the core meta of what makes these comics so irresistible to the fans.",4i35uf
d2vbfra,"It would have been SO EASY for them to just release the other assassins and have Iron Man and Cap make up and fight them.

It wouldn't have been quite as bad as ""both our moms are named Martha"", but it wouldn't have been good either. ",4i35uf
d2utqlt,That was such a nice twist. I was fully expecting the usual cliche where the real baddies come out in the third act and everyone is suddenly cool again to fight the baddies together. ,4i35uf
d2v5ca1,"Somewhere Zack Snyder says ""so lame. No one even died. And they could have had cool cgi with the super soldiers. Wasted opportunity."" And this is why he should stick to cinematography and not directing. ",4i35uf
d2uy89r,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but one of the pods in the scene where Captain America, Iron Man and Bucky enter was empty. It was the pod of the guy who beat Bucky when they were sparring in one of the flashbacks.",4i35uf
d2vebbl,That was incredibly unexpected which made the scene so much better. It also made scenes in the first half hour of the movie make so much more sense. ,4i35uf
d2vn347,"I also loved that Zemo was captured without a big punch fest, and even attempted suicide, it's a fantastic subversion of the tropes.",4i35uf
d2utlw3,"Im glad it happened that way. It would have been pretty confusing if he or any of those other super soldiers were part of that fight based on  the history and the core of the vengeance Tony had was due to his parents.

As soon as Tony figured out that Zemo was the one responsible and it wasn't Bucky it would have made it pretty tricky if those other soldiers were around.

It was obvious at that point since we hadn't seen it yet in the movie but knew from the trailer that Tony was going to Duke it out with Cap/Bucky that the fight was gonna happen.

And having them around wouldn't have made much sense unless T'Chala was gonna fight them all on his own (which would have been awesome cause he was probably my favorite part of the movie).",4i35uf
d2ve48d,"Also super cool how they gave Zemo an out of costume role, and sort of mashed him up with the Agent Carters Psychiatrist character from the comics too.",4i35uf
d2vga4v,I was really relieved that the 3rd act fight was between Iron Man and Cap and they didn't have some bullshit Winter Soldier squad as a bandaid baddy. ,4i35uf
d2vk24c,"Yeah, I was so sure that we were headed for a 'let's team up and fight the super soldiers!' ending. Subverted completely. This is why these movies are good.",4i35uf
d2vljmg,"It was a really nice surprise, but ""incredible""? I think we should hold these things to a higher standard. It was clever writing rooted in character, but that should be expected. It's just a shame that 90% of these movies opt for the other, dumber route.",4i35uf
d2vuu6g,I absolutely did not see that ending coming at all. Can't believe I went into a Marvel movie and was legitimately surprised by the third act. Good job Russo Bros.,4i35uf
d2wt001,Why did he kill them though? I didn't understand that. I also didn't understand what Howard Stark was transporting? Super soldier serum? If so does that mean Winter Soldier is just as powerful as Captain America?,4i35uf
d2x01zb,I liked that it was his plan all along.,4i35uf
d2x9zyy,He sure put a whole lot of effort into that setup though.,4i35uf
d2ycq6z,When Tony was watching the scene about Bucky and his parents i did a quick look down my row and every persons jaw was dropped lol. Awesome twist.,4i35uf
d2z5aje,I was getting ready to write the movie off because of another generic villain but wow I wasn't expecting that twist and it really paid off.,4i35uf
d2vesw2,I was a little confused about how that all came to pass. Was Zemo just hoping that Tony would find out where Steve and Bucky were headed so that he could play the video for them? It seemed a bit too convenient that they all converged at the place with the video. ,4i35uf
d2vzwjj,I secretly wanted to see the 5 super soldiers released since it was clear they were stronger than Bucky,4i35uf
d2w5pc3,maybe i misunderstood it but that's one of the biggest complaints i had with the movie: the Zemo guy only had like only a year to plan everything? like it was a good plan to pitch the superheros against one another but really? only a year to plan everything and everything went according to his plan? c'mon,4i35uf
d2w6uxw,I didn't catch if he killed the strongest one. Did he?,4i35uf
d2wfbsm,"Yeah, I figured it'd be a final battle vs. random countless super soldiers.  So happy they didn't blow the ending.  ",4i35uf
d2y5g4d,"Yeah, it was a really good twist. You thought Zemo was going to unleash the other super soldiers and Cap, Bucky, Stark and Panther were going to have to team up to save the day and everything would be alright between them.

But nope. Zemo murdered all of them while they were frozen. Then he defeated the heroes without throwing a single punch.",4i35uf
d2z55q0,Horrible ending and easily the worst part. A plot centered on them fighting each other assuming they wouldn't talk like civilized human beings. ,4i35uf
d30i8me,"Brilliant from the writers to do that. I looked at my watch and realised that there was 30 minutes left. Thought, ""it's time for the big reunion and the shitty weak baddies"" didn't get that at all. Hoodwinked!",4i35uf
d310p4i,Anyone wondered how Zemo found/built the EMP device and how he transported in/out of the hotel?,4i35uf
d3cgi4l,Yeah I really thought he'd absorb all their power and become a super-duper soldier. But he let them do it themselves. I liked that a lot.,4i35uf
d3p1wt3,"Did he kill all of them? When he went in the bunker i swear there were 6 occupied cryo chambers. When cap, bucky and iron man went in I know there were only 5!",4i35uf

He could have hypnotized them for himself!",4i35uf
d2vhnmp,Very Watchmenesque,4i35uf
d2updqo,That scene was really impressive. I kept looking for cgi artifacts but it just looked so real.,4i35uf
d2uq7l6,When I saw that I was sure that hologram thing was going to come back as plot device later. Turns out it was just there to plant the seed of Tony's relationship with his parents and how that impacted him. ,4i35uf
d2uo2zv,I actually thought they didn't *quite* nail the CG on that. I got a very strong uncanny valley feel. IMO they did a much better job with Michael Douglas in Ant-man.,4i35uf

I'm sorry, but my female friends and I were just wincing throughout the incredibly obvious Captain America makeup...his lips were coloured and drawn (could even see the lip line), his eyebrows were too coloured in, and that foundation and contour!

They save as much as they can, even the blunder that Scarlet Witch made maybe was lowering the count of people who were going to die if that thing exploded in a middle of a square full of people.

He was only in 15 minutes of the movie and half of that was a mostly CGI fight (sequences and voice-overs I picture being handled after most of the movie was already done).

Going back to the first movie, it Steve's heart and mind that drives him more than anything else, and seeing that come alive like it has is amazing story telling. He's a man of principle, and that principle is the driving force behind his strength. At this point he makes everyone else look like short sighted meat-heads in comparison, and really shows him as more than a soldier, but the leader that earned him the title of Captain.",4i35uf

Batman vs. Superman made sense but wasn't anything amazing as to why it happened. I couldn't figure out why Tony would battle Cap & The Winter Soldier in that bunker after such a legitimate agreement they had. There was no generic twist of what caused the battle.

Having said that, they didn't hold back on the spectacle this time around. The other thing is the Winter Soldier, another character that takes work. In terms of concepts, he's just a spy with a metal arm. That really is B-movie material, but they built the character with some excellent acting and choice dialogue.

Someone pointed out that Zemo's plan at the end was weirdly contingent on Cap, Bucky, and Tony all showing up at his base.

I mean, they'd feel dumb for picking a fight with Tony when ultimately Zemo wasn't really that dangerous, but things would've been pretty good.

I will frame this Bucky guy, so other people can find him, so I can impersonate a psychiatrist and find out the location of these other super assassins (and then kill him), and then hope that all the avengers come after me at the same time, so I can show a video that drives them apart.

Isn't it a lot easier to drive a wedge into the avengers some other way? Especially since Captain america already knew that Stark's parents were killed by the winter soldier another way?",4i35uf
d36mcyw,"I still don't completely understand the depth of his resources. I know I'm missing something.

It looks like it was mostly done by himself, but how did he have so much Hydra knowledge. And who delivers an EMP thing?",4i35uf
d3dczrc,"I would recommend reading ""Zemo: Born Better"" he's different in the comics but still a pretty interesting character",4i35uf
d2vfs1j,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but to me there was something missing from Zemo. He made his motivation clear, but it didn't quite feel strong enough to me with everything else going on.

Zemo's plan for this movie is definitely a [Batman Gambit](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit). His plan relies on knowing precisely how characters will react to his actions, and then builds upon those reactions in a more and more improbable chain of events.

The clearest example of this is the climax of the movie. We find out Zemo has killed all the ""other"" Winter Soldiers, and his plan was just to break the Avengers apart, which he definitively does by showing the video of Bucky killing the Starks. How did Zemo even know Tony was going to come? What would have happened if they had sent Vision, or Black Widow, or a unit of special forces? What if Tony hadn't gone alone, and he had someone to help calm him down? Or even worse, what if no one had found out where Steve and Bucky were going? They would have gotten there only to find Zemo completely alone and just apprehended him with no problem.

Now, that's a fairly common thing in movies nowadays, and honestly it really doesn't bother me as much as it seems to bother other people. Especially in a superhero movie, it's not that hard to suspend disbelief, however...

If you want me to suspend disbelief about this sort of plot, I need a better motivation. Having your family killed by reckless superheroes is a reasonable motivation, but to me it does not feel strong enough to bridge the gap to ""torturing and murdering multiple people, setting off mutlple car bombs, and hatching an incredibly elaborate plot to tear the Avengers apart"". Especially when we don't even learn about the family angle until a significant way through. And especially when you have other examples earlier in the movie - a mother who lost her son in the exact same event gives a ""shame on you"" speech to Tony, and a king who lost citizens makes a relatively benign political statement - that make it seem like the rest of the world is comfortable with just giving them a slap on the wrist.

This is where I feel like something was ""missing"" from the story. What exactly is it in Zemo's character that makes him go to *this* length? It feels very ""personal"" to him.  Obviously losing your family is very personal, but he seems to care very personally about hurting Steve and Tony, not just breaking the Avengers in general.

There are a few things he says that I felt like could have been expanded more to complete the picture for me. One was when he commented about Steve's eyes having ""a little bit of green in them"" - i.e. not perfectly blue. To me, that speaks more like someone who used to idolize Captain America before his family was killed, but that is not otherwise shown in the story. Expanding on that idea a little would have gone a *huge* way towards explaining Zemo's motivations. Idolizing someone as a hero who then kills your family (even if indirectly) could drive the kind of dedication we see in Zemo.

Also, when Zemo has killed the ""other"" Winter Soldiers, he says something to the effect of ""as if the world needed more of you"". Again, this was not expanded on anywhere else in the movie, but this is potentially a *huge* detail important to his motivation. The idea of having this extreme hatred towards enhanced people. I think the movie as a whole missed the mark on this. In a way, I'm not that disappointed about it, because it's been done so many times before (see every X-men movie, for example). But on the flip side, not seeing any sort of societal hatred at all seems kind of strange, and doesn't really help with Zemo's motivation.

tl;dr: I felt like there were a few things missing from the story that left me wondering what motivated Zemo to go to the incredible lengths he did.",4i35uf

d2uvaoa,"I haven't read many of the comics, but when ASM came out people were so excited because based on the trailers they said he would be funny, like in the comics. Then I watched that film and I thought he was mostly annoying, rather than funny, and that Spiderman probably just isn't very funny, even in the comics. But when I watched this film, and was laughing so much, I thought, 'Ah, I get it!'. He's great, can't wait for the solo film now.",4i35uf

It was good! But I thought it was the weakest Cap movie, and way too crowded and it ran way too long.

I didn't super Love black panther.  This movie was so crowded as is, did we really need him?",4i35uf
d2vz68h,"I thought it played kind of weird. I was buying into the sense of peril that the film was building in the first act. But then Stark takes a 6 minute detour to recruit a teenager.

You're not putting this kid in danger? Unless he can totally handle it despite just starting out and I was totally off thinking that Team Cap was a threat. Also you don't know him, Stark, you just come in and sit on his bed, how about some boundaries, stranger. 

I was enjoying the Captain America movie and then it was interrupted with the Spiderman commercial. I didn't like it. I liked the Justice League commercial in BvS more because that movie already felt disjointed and not cohesive so it didn't interrupt anything.

d33hlbc,"Yeah, don't get me wrong, I really liked the movie, but that is sorely needed with all the plot convenient stuff going on. It's not just Cap's shield flying back to his arm at all times, its Spiderman who seems able to overpower everyone present spending most of his time being thrown around by them, its Ant-Man who was established as keeping the same strength at all sizes being able to throw an airplane, its Iron Man's virbranium armor getting severely damaged by hitting it with a shield (like what?).

I know, this is getting into the realm of nerdy nickpiting, but I still hate to see consistency thrown out of the window for the sake of the moment-to-moment plot.",4i35uf
d2v42cj,That line made the movie for me. It may help that I'm a nerdy as physics major.,4i35uf
d2w5skb,It's also such a clever way of showcasing just how much Peter Parker is one of us and the reason he is one of the most popular characters in comics. He's one of us.

d2unjtj,"I was fearful they were going to do a ""lets team up to face the baddie at the end"", but they turned that on its head!",4i35uf
d2uprf2,It was excellent. It played up to his motivations as a villain. He doesn't want anymore supers. He wants the ones that ruined his life with no regard to tear them self apart which he did. He is the most successful marvel villain to date. ,4i35uf

d2upk6n,I'm still a bit confused by that. Why did he kill all the winter soldiers instead of using them for his own purposes?,4i35uf

d2uxblv,"If he hadn't then the plot would've fallen into the same trench as BVS, where the battling protagonists have to team up. This way the focus stays on the fight between protagonists. If Zemo had let them out, we would've gotten a generic brawl where our heroes mercilessly rip apart the ""real bad guys"".",4i35uf
d2uopcj,I was very happy they didn't go Iron Man 3 all over again.,4i35uf
d2uy0at,"It was the antithesis of Winter Soldier. I like Winter Soldier but I hated the Hydra reveal.

d38u0u0,"Late to the party (Just saw the film last night)

I really liked how the villain's goal was getting them to fight.  He hated them for Sokovia and rather than going for the obvious villain play (try and out-muscle them) he tried to turn them on each other.  It was smart.  I liked it.

It was also smart narratively.  It allowed the villain to take a relatively low key position within the story.  He didn't get in the way of why we were really there but he was still interesting and he still acted as a catalyst for the plot.   ",4i35uf
d2uyow1,"Something I didn't notice but someone pointed it out for me after the movie, so I'm not sure how accurate it is. But not all of the other Winter Soldiers are dead. There were 5 of them, I think, and they only showed 4 with a bullet in their head. One of the cage was empty, and the guy who started the riot against the Russians wasn't there.

Guess we'll have to wait for the bluray to confirm that. ",4i35uf
d2uzsi3,Red herring,4i35uf
d2v23dq,I also really like how he seemed to win.  That's not really happened in a Marvel movie before.  Zemo set out to destroy the Avengers and he pretty much did.,4i35uf
d2v3i9l,I disagree with reviewers saying Zemo was the typical villain misfire from Marvel. I think he is MCU's best villain since Loki.,4i35uf
d2v5ggr,"While I like a good twist, I was a little disappointed we didn't get to see a big fight at the end, especially with that big Winter Soldier that even beat up Bucky.",4i35uf
d2v7om8,"No, I really enjoyed it. The twist worked because we had everything figured out and then when Tony says on 1 heat signature and they showed the bullet holes, I thought, ""The fuck does this dude want to accomplish."" It was well done.",4i35uf
d2vx7ih,I liked the twist. Although not quite sure how Cap knew that secret. ,4i35uf
d2w2t31,"Yes, it was an excellent twist. I was weary of a fight against character-less super goons to end the film. Nope, just heroes destroying each other.",4i35uf
d2w5qew,"definitely a pleasant surprise! my only complaint is that he only had like a year to plan this thing out and it pretty much succeeded really easily.. almost too easy, like they were setting up for another movie or something",4i35uf
d2wwik0,"I was really happy. I thought it was going to make every captain america movie about ""NOW WE HAVE TO KILL *THIS* WINTER SOLDIER!"" and I was really revealed to see them dead.",4i35uf

""oh, awesome""",4i35uf
d2x7lij,"I feel that the shock value was taken away because the movie failed to show just how dangerous the Winter Soldiers were aside from what Bucky says. Instead of that scene where they disobeyed the commanders, what about them doing something historically significant like doing some sort of historically significant thing, like assassinate JFK or something. ",4i35uf
d2y5i56,I thought we were going to find out that Zemo *was* a super soldier at the end and all the heroes were going to have to work together to overcome him.,4i35uf
d2yd218,"I didn't see it coming, but I was expecting some sort of twist. I mean, come on, we all knew it wasn't going to be ""Bucky, Steve and Tony team up to fight a bunch of Winter Soldiers""",4i35uf
d302czm,I don't even understand why he had to go there just to kill the other winter soldiers? He did all that just to lure tony and steve in?? If that was true he could've used alot of other ways which are alot more convenient instead of going through all that trouble really.,4i35uf
d30ksm2,Honestly I don't understand why he did that and how it played into his plan. What did getting them to THAT facility and killing the soldiers have to do with anything? What's your take?,4i35uf

d2ur60e,I don't understand why he killed them. Can someone explain this to me?,4i35uf
d2utjki,"It really wouldn't have worked any other way other than them to die honestly.

As soon as Tony figured out that Zima was the one responsible and it wasn't Bucky it would have made it pretty tricky if those other soldiers were around.

It was obvious at that point since we hadn't seen it yet in the movie but knew from the trailer that Tony was going to Duke it out with Cap/Bucky that the fight was gonna happen.

And having them around wouldn't have made much sense unless T'Chala was gonna fight them all on his own (which would have been awesome cause he was probably my favorite part of the movie).",4i35uf

I also love how all three of them (Bucky, Black Panther, and Cap) effortlessly outrun the cars in the tunnel. The first time they show Bucky running faster than one of the cars was the biggest ""Holy shit"" moment from me. Not even Giant-Man topped that moment if you ask me.",4i35uf
d2uvq0o,"I really loved that. Also the little end scene with him trying to explain why he looks so busted up ""Nah, Mae, his name is Steve, he's from Brooklyn, you don't know him""  

Also just realized that the three, like...arguably *nicest* people in the Super Hero crowd - Daredevil, Captain America, and Spider-Man - are all New Yorkers. They should start a NY Boy Scout troop or something, hehe",4i35uf

You understand why everyone did what they did. Tony's guilt led him down his path, Cap stood for personal freedom and his fight to protect his family (Bucky), even why Black Widow changed side half way through the fight. ",4i35uf

d30oc9i,Yes!  They should just release that fight to theaters and charge 5 bucks or something.  I'd pay it. ,4i35uf
d2xttiy,I thought it was really goofy that Ant-Man was moving like an astronaut when he was giant. It looked like he was in slow motion or something. Is that an effect of growing so large? I haven't seen Ant-Man yet (about to start it actually).,4i35uf
d3k5qny,"When Cap said ""We gotta go"" I said ""No!  Keep fighting!""  I wish it was 20 minutes longer.",4i35uf
d2uq5sj,"What I like about it is they cut out some of the overly flowery stuff to it and just cut it down to the basics, cause I'm pretty the original had a whole ""by the banks of the river of truth"" line that was just terribly awkward.

And I love that Peggy is the one who (indirectly) says it, thus giving Cap a clear moral standpoint for the rest of the movie, and one they call back to at least 2-3 times, with various characters telling him to literally move or to give up. He thankfully never responds with a cingey ""no, you move,"" he just **refuses to move.**

So good.",4i35uf

I feel that movie was just the Russo bros jerking off comic book fans so goddamn hard. No complaints.",4i35uf
d2zkr91,"It shaken me a little because it technically was Carter who said it, and it suits her so much better than Cap to say it. Technically Cap didn't say it on the comics either, he quoted it, making in both places to be appropriate for him to follow, but here it has so much more heart.

Actually the whole Cap-Peggy-Howard-Tony relationship makes things so much more heartbreaking in this movie and so much better if you watch Agent Carter.",4i35uf
d2usa8f,that made me snicker too.,4i35uf
d2v4f4y,"It was classic ""heart vs mind"" which was done so well.

You feel for Capt, he *has* to defend Bucky. 

You feel for Tony, he *has* to be angry and try and avenge his mother. The guy's a motherfucking Avenger for christ's sake.

There is no good guy, there is no bad guy. They are fighting because fundamentally they are different and at their core they cannot agree.

It's about family, it's about loss, it's about protecting those you care about. 

I must have flipped back and forth 10 times during that movie. ",4i35uf
d2vhq6n,"I like that it summed up where they left everything. If they need to, they'll work together, but there's too much between them to be ""together"". 

Stark's wanting to end to fight, it's been is endgame for a long time, and Ultron showed him that he could be his own worst enemy. He wants oversight, someone to give him a sanity check. 

Cap's a soldier. He understands the endgame, but, fundamentally, he sees the battle in front of him. You can't fill a battle with beaurocracy. It slows you down, and compromises what you can do. 

Stark's outburst, and Cap's ""emotional"" defensive reaction is only going to reinforce Tony's stance. When presented with emotions, you need to be dispassionate. And for Cap, it'll be validation. Tony went off the rails, and the oversight came from fellow soldiers, not the brass back at the desk. 

It's left the conflict between the team, where the audience investment is, which makes it very interesting, while keeping enough options to fight an attacker when they want to. ",4i35uf
d2v4bpu,Even better was the fact that the good guys were fighting each other for something they believe in. It wasn't just mind control.,4i35uf
d2uspun,I went in fully expecting a Doomsday to pop up at some point. I'm glad they had the confidence that the titular civil war would be interesting enough to be the main conflict of the film.,4i35uf
d2v4g41,"Iron Man was ~~wrong~~ [edit: right, typo] in the larger picture. In the small, *he's* the one who needs oversight. The things he has done is what put the world at threat with Ultron. Twice! He honestly cannot stop himself from doing whatever he feels he should. Even with the Accords signed, he still acts outside them when he wants. 

The Accords are just him projecting. ",4i35uf

d2uooio,"That's a nice thought, but Tony had that issue fixed in Iron Man 3. He had surgery to remove the shrapnel, and chucked the arc reactor into the ocean. They're just the power source for the suits now.",4i35uf

d2w4riq,"Well, it's not really his heart anymore. In Iron Man 3 they used the Extremis stuff to heal his heart so the chest thing is only a power source now. I mean, I guess it still symbolizes his heart, though.",4i35uf
d2ur2zf,"I thought it was alright.  A pretty good movie, but nowhere near ""the best marvel movie ever!"" as it was being touted.

I actually think it was the ""worst"" Captain America movie.

When it was fun, it was fun.  But this movie was chaotic in the worst ways, overfilled, and ran way too long.

We can't, with a straight face, diss BvS for being too long and too stuffed ""they're just throwing everything in one movie,
Please and in the same breath give this movie a pass.

Granted, this movie was actually good, and yes if it had been any shorter it would have suffered from BvS where it would nonsensical.'

Still, my initial reaction is that it was pretty good, but had some very serious flaws.  It could have, and should have, been two or three different movies.

d2urq80,Can someone explain to me why they were even able to remove the shards? I thought the entire point of the reactor was that the shards were to close to his heart to operate. But then in iron man 3 they remove them like nothing. It's been a awhile since I've seen those movies so I'm probably forgetting something.,4i35uf
d2w5q61,doesn't he have a separate reactor for his suits and body ? ,4i35uf

d2xusrq,"And to top it all off: The villain actually WON for once. He set out to tear the Avengers apart, and he did it flawlessly through nothing more than mind games and some already present brainwashing. Never even had to lift a finger to fight a super hero.

Considering his opponents were two iron men, a metal android,a super strong assassin, a boy who dresses up like a spider, a man who dresses up like a panther, a girl with reality warping powers, a man with super serum, another super strong assassin with a metal arm, an expert archer, a man who dresses up as a bird, and man who can change his size at will, and add in the fact he's just a normal colonel; that's pretty impressive.",4i35uf

I really like that they addressed that, but...man, I've got some complaints with all of that, too.  

Like, yeah, there's a lot of collateral damage, but...if they didn't stop Ultron, that would've wiped out human life (granted, Tony made Ultron..*whoops*). If they didn't move (Skully Hydra Agent Dude?) into the sky...everyone on the ground would've been dead (okay, that might be their bad, Cap'n and Scarlet got saved, I think everyone else was backed the hell up out of the way). The Helicarrier falling was Hydra, for the most part. *Alien Invasion* in New York, and you're going to talk shit about them accidentally crashing into a few buildings while fighting the god damn techno dragon thing? The *fuck*, man!? And the government was ready to drop a fucking nuke on that entire city and wipe out 10 million+ civilians! Didn't mention that part, Ross, you mustachioed *fuck*.

Like, everything bad they've done, it's fucked up, but it's better than what *would* have happened.  

It's like that fucked up morality/ethics question where you've got a train barreling down the track, you're at the helm of the switcher thingy, and there's one guy on one track, and ten guys on the other track. Is it right to make the choice to kill the one guy instead of the ten? What if the one guy is a family member and the ten people are all strangers? Shit like that.  

Maybe it's just a Kobayashi Maru situation where there's no real way to win. Someone, somewhere, is going to be pissed off with how it happens.",4i35uf
d2ur0me,"I was prepared to dislike Zemo based on reviews saying he was another awful Marvel villain, but I actually love how he's the culmination of all of the Avengers' collateral damage. You can understand his motives and he executed his plan despite not having any superhuman abilities.

How could he possibly have known that Cap, Tony, and Bucky would all go to the bunker, and get there at about the same time? Could his plan have worked without that? Also how did Tony get there at the same time as the others in the first place? Cap must have had a head start of at least a few hours.  I really enjoyed the movie, but that part irked me a bit.

d2x1t0j,"He should have just been some other random person then and not Baron Zemo, because that was NOT Baron Zemo.

I get it, the guys hurt, but I think it would be better if he would've had a plan to not only break up the Avengers but also find a way of destroying them too.

In the first Iron Man, it took a straight hit to the face from a tank with nothing but paint damage. In this one, you can whack it with a shield a couple of times and everything breaks like candy. And how cool would it have been if Cap wasn't able to stop Tony?

I enjoyed the later bits of the movie very much, probably right up there in my favorite Marvel movies thus far. What I didn't enjoy was the group of 3 or 4 guys behind me who were talking constantly for the first 30-45 minutes or so. Kicking my seat, burping/farting, laughing at scenes that weren't even funny (like when Cap catches the grenade under his shield, or many of the early scenes with Bucky for some reason) and moaning whenever Emily VanCamp was on screen. They finally shut up after somebody told them to cut it out, but still did the moaning thing. One of them threw something at me (a marshmallow?). I'm guessing because I kept shooting glances back at them. Just great.

Easily the douchiest group of twats I've ever had the displeasure of encountering at the theater. If I wanted an experience like that I would go back to high school.

d2uqyuz,"> Natasha berates Tony for having a massive ego, but he's the one trying to keep the team together and keep them in check through outside balancing. Doesn't that mean he's actively ignoring his ego?

No, because he's not doing it out of selflessness, but because he feels guilty.

>But that was actively Wilson's fault (and Vision's to a degree).

It was Vision's fault for being distracted, you can't blame Wilson for dodging an attack.

>Even in the end, Tony is actively helping Rogers and it turns out Rogers was keeping the fact that Bucky killed the Starks from him (which, also, when did Cap find that out?).

He only kept the fact that Hydra killed them a secret, he didn't know it was Bucky.

>Even that last scene where Rogers sends him the message saying that he'll come if Tony calls, as if Rogers has the moral high ground.

Rogers absolutely has the moral high ground. After Winter Soldier he's lost trust in taking orders from government bodies (he also correctly predicts that superheroes who don't abide will be interned in secret facilities). Tony lets his own personal guilt drive him into forcing Rogers into an ultimatum (government oversight or protecting a friend).

>Despite the fact that, you know, Bucky killed his parents.

A few minutes earlier Stark calls Bucky ""Manchurian candidate"", so it's clear that he knows Bucky wasn't in control of his own actions.

>It just seems that the movie respects the Cap's viewpoint more than Stark's when I think it should have been more neutral.

Given the events of the previous films (Ultron and Winter soldier), and the personalities involved I think it  was about as neutral as it could be.",4i35uf
d2urp08,"I think the reason is that Tony is taking it too far and refusing to see why their friend might be justified in his little rebellion. Cap always has the moral high ground except for not telling Tony that Bucky killed his parents but he owned up to that. Tony only saw that they needed to be held accountable to pay for his sins, so he went ultra gung ho on being a government stooge. Then when he realized that Cap was right about the frame up and the government being a bunch of dicks, Tony does his own secret Iron Man op. 


The way the Russos handle Cap is that he's the boy scout and the good samaritan but he's thrown into these murky, impossible situations where he knows he's doing the right thing and in the right way but won't be respected or valued at all. It's the same in the cartoon Earth's Mightiest Heroes, where even though he's blamed for a skrull imposter's actions, he does what he needs to do. Help people.",4i35uf
d2v9rbt,">an airport had to be evacuated and millions of dollars of damage was caused because Rogers spent more time looking out for Bucky than he did for his own team

An airport had to be evacuated because Tony wanted to lock up an innocent man while letting the guilty one go free. Because Tony wanted to fight while Cap and Bucky were just trying to head to Siberia.

As for morality, just look at what Tony did. He put Wanda under house arrest. He locked his friends up in a supervillain prison without a trial. He attempted to kill an innocent man. He brought a 16 year old kid to a fight without giving him the full story and it put him in harm's way. And he did all this because he was feeling guilty about Sokovia. He's a hypocrite that wants to check everyone else's power but not his own. He's not trying to do the right thing, he's trying to feel less guilty.

>it treats Tony losing control at the end like he's the bad guy here

He was trying to kill Bucky for selfish reasons. That 100% makes him the bad guy. At the same time T'Chala saves Zemo's life for completely unselfish reasons. It's quite the contrast.

Same thing with the Sokovia incident, death toll should have been way higher than 125 or whatever it said.

I think the core issue in the film (the public blaming the Avengers) would have made more sense if large amounts of people were killed.

d2vywdm,I think it's that Zemo knew that Captain America would defend Bucky. His plan was to use Bucky to create a rift in the Avengers and tear them apart from the inside. Iron Man wants to kill Bucky. Cap won't let him. They fight. Regardless of who wins; no more Avengers.,4i35uf

I want to know where all these checks and balances Tony was demanding when he convinced a kid, under the radar, to risk his life against trained super heroes.

d2xjp4v,It was so damn good,4i35uf
d327le2,"I think the point the my were trying to make is that the government would have been held accountable due to legal system (well, in theory) but the Avengers have been accountable to no one. There is no system to help keep the avengers in check other than themselves, and no (apparently) organized way to involve governments when their citizens and properties are collateral damage. 

Though yes, I think the other half of that point (which didn't really get addressed unfortunately) was that ""who on earth could have stopped these kinds of enemies WITHOUT collateral?"" The world governments are right to be concerned, but if their behavior in the movie suggests anything, they also seem less willing to accept that collateral happens when the avengers fight. An impossible standard. This is reflected (IMO) in how they first decide to go after Bucky, and in how they imprison the avengers afterwards. The underling notion being that this was more about control than justice for people. ",4i35uf

But Civil War is like a giant fuck you to BvS. There's a great quote from a Vox review:

>It's like the creative team at Marvel got an early look at Batman v Superman and took it upon themselves to show the executives at Warner Bros. how to make a superhero-versus-superhero film built on many of the same themes as Batman v Superman but that isn't a dark hurricane of disappointment and stink.

Like everything this movie does shits on BvS. The subversion of ""superheroes fight each other then team  up for a big bad."" The avoidance of another uncle ben spidey intro. Actual investment into characters. Thematic depth not dropping halfway through the film. True humor.",4i35uf

d2v89m1,"I think that fight, no holds bar, would definitely end up with team Stark crushing team Captain America. I'm not a huge comic book guy, so this could be horribly uninformed but, o well. One on one:

Stark v Rogers: Stark is told he can't compete with Rogers in hand to hand combat in the final fight sequence, yet he does take him down (almost completely) once his suit analyzes Rogers' fighting style. So stay in the freaking air so Rogers can't get you! You have the weapons, technology, and smarts to kick his butt (use the information you gave Parker when he took Rogers down earlier). 

Rhodey v. Winter Soilder: Same think as Stark

Spiderman v Ant Man: Minus when Ant Man goes supersized, and even then Parker still holds his own/takes him down.

Vision v Red Witch: Interesting since we saw Red Witch control him at the Avengers HQ, but the guy is basically a god. With the capabilities he should have, he is better than everyone else.

Black Panther v Falcon: The only air supremacy that Team CA has. Even then, Black Panther could probably still mess Falcon up if he gets a hold of him. Black Panther was probably my favorite new character in this film.

Black Widow v Hawkeye: Has been shown that Black Widow can take Hawkeye down, as seen in the first Avengers movie, and she was kicking his butt in this film (even though he was ""pulling his punches).

Even if you switch up the head to head match-ups, to something like BP v Hawkeye and BW v RW, Vision could destroy whoever is left.

Check that: Put Vision on Falcon since they can both fly, leaving BP with Hawkeye and BW with RW. I'd still take team Stark.",4i35uf
d2w429l,"I'm with you on spider man. 

He wasn't bad at all. But I think I already got my dose of cute fan boy from Ant Man, wise cracks from Whedon, teenager with power from Days Of Future Past Quicksilver. Peter Parker is smart but we got Tony Stark. He's strong and we have a hulk. He's pure and we got Steve Rogers. 

This Spiderman doesn't seem to bring anything unique that I have not already got another role covering from existing offerings.

Again he's not bad but I am just not hungry for more of what he's got. :/ ",4i35uf

d2v9urz,"Black Panther was phenomenal. I went in knowing I'd agree with Cap's stance and left vindicated. Bucky's inclusion in the story (instead of relying on the comic book) was ingenious. He represents the moral hazard that Captain America fears in government run superheroes. Government oversight removes the agency of the heroes, leaving them as little more than weapons to be pointed wherever the U.N. decides.

I thought that it was completely congruous with Cap's arc as well. From the very first film he has been rebelling against being told what to do by bureaucrats. He spent part of WWII being paraded around as a public relations tool instead of actually realizing his potential. He rebels against the role because he is wasted in it. In the second film the government is using him to his full potential but they are engaged in immoral activities, the planned extrajudicial killing of people all over the world in the name of maintaining ""order"". Though fully utilized, he rebels because his moral compass does not allow him to be used for evil. When we arrive in the third film he has become fully self actualized - no longer needing the recognition or oversight of institutions.

He sees the Accords not as a check on what the Avengers do, but as a means to reduce them to props as he was in The First Avenger or as the weapons for morally dubious actions sanctioned by governments, as he was in Winter Soldier and as his best friend had been for 60 years.

Iron Man's argument wasn't wrong, it just wasn't as informed as Steve's was. I think that, had the kill order not been placed on Bucky and Bucky not been set up, Cap would ultimately have signed on to the Accords to quell the public but would have abandoned them the second he didn't agree with them. Furthermore, I think Stark would have too.",4i35uf
d2v99tj,"I think we see hints of how dark the Accords actually are, and how right Cap might be when Tony visits the prison near the end. What does this actually mean? It's really creepy, and now even Tony rejects this. 

But then I think the ending (where you could argue Tony is the villain,) he just says ""f this, I'm taking this guy in/killing him, regardless,"" which was reasonably-good writing to justify the fight.  ",4i35uf

Here a list of feats of Spider-man in the comics: http://aminoapps.com/page/comics/9411297/how-strong-is-spiderman
This probably the most accurately description of his strength.

Spider-Man is much, much stronger than Captain America or Bucky. Captain America has been shown in the comics to lift around 1,200lbs. Spider-man has been shown to lift close to 20 tons.

I agree that felt a little contrived and rushed to me. They didn't even replace his arm. Maybe it'll make sense in the next movie?

Spidey is one of the strongest characters in the comics.... so no.

Yup, that was about the freedom of choice. Which was Cap's underlying problem with the Accords. Basically, he thought that a governmental body would be too stringent and rigid, causing the Avenger to act/not act in situations where they may/may not have been needed. Bucky chose the cryogenic fate, he wasn't forced into it. It was actually kinda beautiful.

Tony is a child that is driven by grief and anger throughout the movie. (We see this at MIT when Pepper isn't there, and when the mother calls him out for trying to cover his guilt with huge sums of money being dumped into charity). He is unable to cope with loss in a healthy manner (that's why Pepper left, because he just kept burying himself in work to avoid it, and it's why Cap told him that he needed to surround himself with people in the letter at the end). Tony wants to fix everything, and he thought that the Accords would be a fix for the Avengers and quit putting them on the wrong side of catastrophic fallout. He was angry at the Avengers who didn't listen to him, as it forced him to lock them up. Basically it was ""If you would have just listened to me, none of this would have happened."" Tony's great idea didn't work out the way he wanted it to, and he feels guilty/angry at his friends for going against his wishes.",4i35uf

2) I doubt the police could do shit against Bucky. Panther however...

3) Yep.

4) Yes, the airport fight was something he couldn't guess. If say, Scarlet Witch was anywhere besides locked at home she would read their minds, establish a truce until they go and check. There was not even a need for Bucky or Iron man to even go there, Vision and War Machine (and Panther, considering of what they were accusing Zemo) could check this out, take Zemo and even the other soldiers, done.

5) Yeah, if Falcon didn't say a thing not trusting Stark, it would sum up in Cap and Bucky sitting over Zemo while mourning the other winter soldiers and Bucky making fun of Cap didn't have sex so far.

6) Iron man showed to easily destroy that thing he was hiding on. Take him down. Also, there was no way of him knowing if Cap haven't told Iron Man about Stark or that Iron man himself didn't find out while trying to hack Hydra through the time in between Winter Soldier and Ultron (or even up to Civil War, for that matter), I mean, Zemo did it, I don't see why Jarvis/Friday wouldn't scan himself and say: Erm... Mr. Stark I believe I found files regarding the death of your father, Sir.

Extra) YES, It is pure luck. There wasn't a reason for Hydra to put that there and calculate exactly where. I suppose they could say it was a Drone Howard got and it was captured or something, but it would kinda ruin the ""accident"" thing with something so important just disappearing.

It is my second favorite movie but... Yeah. Zemo was actually just lucky for a dumb spy (Oh, the avengers made a city fly? Don't worry, you're not in it, no need to run or anything darling). If Tony found the files in this movie by himself the story would play exactly the same, there was no point of him taking his luck so far, he could just go by himself before meeting the winter soldier, kill or use the other 5 winter soldiers, and send or make it public for everyone what the Winter Soldier did and that would 100% would make Stark see it.

It bothers me how so many people say Zemo actually won, he did not. The avengers still exist, the Sokovia Accords would happen anyway and there would be some kind of a fight between Cap and Iron man. The team parted ways but they're not exactly enemies, it was a loss, but no bigger than the avengers did on themselves. The only thing he actually caused was Panther's death, which ironically is the one who stopped him by escaping through suicide. In reality, nobody won in this movie, except Spider-man, who got a new suit. (Team Homework!)",4i35uf
d2w33jv,"1) He could have known about it, it was on the news.



2) That would have helped since Cap would be mad at everyone, especially if he figured out Bucky was framed. What if he had a back up plan? You can see him watch the news and only start the next part of his plan once he knows Bucky and Cap are missing after the break out.


4) If Iron Man beat Cap and locked him up his plan worked immediately without needing the Siberia at all, the team is divided.


5) Sure, why not, it's a bunker.


6) His plan always relied on them fighting each other, it wouldn't have worked in the first place if Avengers agreed what to do with Bucky. So that's just nitpicking. 


Extra) He had the video. If he didn't have it he wouldn't show it.


Also the super assassin took the tape, obviously. Because no one knew Starks were killed, it was reported as an accident.

Nobody wants to actually hurt or kill each other (except Panther), hell Clint is pulling his punches, but there's still the conflict there and for that reason they have to fight. It's 6v6, if one of them didn't take the other, it's potentially bad because then someone is fighting 2v1.",4i35uf

Also Ross is just the US gov representative. His views are really that of the government and the accords itself.",4i35uf

More than likely the German unit shown in the film was most likely GSG 9, Germany's Anti-Terrorism Unit (often consider to be one of the best in the world). Now seeing how the bombing happened in Europe it wouldn't be to far of a stretch to say that all agencies were put on the highest of alert to mobilize on any reliable tip and the GSG 9 have been known to travel to other countries to help with crisises.


Seeing how Sharron had all that info ready for the CIA, it could also be assumed that other agencies shared or at the very least found the same info to find Bucky. This is of course all just guesses so it's to be taken with a grain a salt.",4i35uf

There are several things I noticed Civil War trumped BvS, but probably the most noticeable was how well developed the story is. Every thing flows very succinctly, the character's reasoning is very solid, and the twist at the end with Bucky and Tony's parents was so perfect.

- I'd have to watch the airport scene again. 


- Why would you want to blow your own Quin-Jet? It's different than blowing up his own suits because those are his. The Quin-Jet is what the Avengers need to move from one spot to another.

Like.. I feel like I NEED to see it again so I can catch everything I might have missed. The writing and dialogue are so fucking solid.

Also I don't think Tony has gotten over Bucky killing his parents. He's more upset that Cap knew about it and never told him.

He blames himself for every death he has caused. All that has happened has lead to him realising that people like him need to be kept in check.

Captain America starts off as a stalwart government supporter but in every single film, he has his faith in the government broken. In the Avengers, he sees that SHIELD has been lying to him and are making weapons and then in the Winter Soldier, he finds out that SHIELD are the enemy and have been HYDRA the entire time.

When he says ""someone needs to keep us in check"".  He's absolutely condoning his own behavior from the last Avengers movie.  2) In the 2nd Captain America movie, Steve gladly worked for S.H.I.E.L.D. running opts missions where he didn't get all the information and eventually found out he had been working for Hydra the entire time.

d2x36je,"Just staying in the MCU, Stark has massive PTSD and is looking to do anything he can to ease his conscience/shift the guilt.  Cap is a true patriot, meaning he cares more about the principals of our country than the people that make up the government, so just like in Winter Soldier, he fought against the government to stand up for what he believes to be right.  ",4i35uf
d2x3nwq,"I read it as Tony trying to dump the guilt of bad decision making off on someone else.  After his near-death moment over New York and unleashing Ultron on the world, he's looking for some way to not feel guilty.  It's almost impossible to get a narcissist like Stark to admit he's wrong.  And the more glaringly obvious it is that he screwed up, the more it breaks his ""I'm always right"" self-image.  

Cap, on the other hand, has squared away the idea that you can make all the right decisions and sometimes people die anyway.  Old soldier's internalize and make peace with the idea that their actions sometimes get people killed.  Like he said, ""you save as many people as you can.""  He isn't torn up by guilt and cognitive dissonance like Tony.  Plus, waking up to Hydra having infiltrated SHIELD for decades, he really doesn't trust modern bureaucracies.  ""That's not freedom, that's fear"" ",4i35uf
d2x3ol3,and then Hydra happened ,4i35uf
d2x3xjp,"I think the point of Stark's character is that he's the exception that proves the rule, and he knows it. Not only has Stark witnessed other super beings nearly destroy the Earth a few times, he's seen *himself* nearly do the same (though indirectly through creating Ultron). The man knows he's on a downward spiral and that his own power is dangerous, so he wants someone else to keep super people in check in case, like him, they start making poor decisions as well (this is probably why the somewhat mentally distressed Scarlet Witch is focused on so much).  

The previous Captain America movie was all about how Cap cares more about the ideological America (Freedom, Liberty, etc.) than the current government. Incidentally, I think that also ushers (though not so prominently in any of the movies themselves) in a little tension with his title. Captain *America* is not a very universal name, especially if we're dealing with problems in other parts of the world. How can we trust his ""American"" ideologies are the best for everyone on Earth?",4i35uf

So Zemo is not a Baron. He is not Hydra. He is just a random civilian with military background. Yet somehow he knows that Bucky killed Stark's parents. He knows the footage is somewhere in an old Siberian base and happened in a specific date. And his entire plan hinges on this knowledge (and finding it: remember, he didn't have it throughout most of the movie, he just SOMEHOW knew it existed and was looking for it) included the trigger words for Bucky.

How the fuck does he know ANY of this?

How did he know Hydra would lead him down this particular rabbit hole? When did he start searching? After Hydra was already done for? (Here's a fun game to play: Count how many times you realize Agents of Shield does not matter to the movies, since in his search for Hydra operatives not once did Zemo come across the Hydra of Agents of Shield. Said Hydra, I might add, is supposed to be the only remnant, and the strongest strain, of Hydra left in the world. But nope, Bob Hydra here is much more important than Ward or Strucker's son.)

Zemo's entire plan relies on much much more coincidences than even The Joker's in TDK.

People are worried that the Avengers can potentially turn out like him. It isn't just purely because of the collateral damage angle, although that's the main one. 

The connection is subtle but it's there. 

And honestly what you're hoping for isn't even practical. Did you just want them to spend half the film on politics? Because that's what it's going to be like realistically with so little supers involved. It's a blockbuster. This film did the best it could have ever done with that in mind. It had a good balance of heart/character development/plot progression/conflict/action, leaning a bit heavy on the action side but I appreciated that.

Even in the comic book it only felt longer cause there were fights after fights. In this film a natural way was to continue with the Bucky thing chasing Zemo. I mean did you want a bunch of court hearings and political back and forth instead? That's really all that could have happened with that.

Captain America has the experience of WWII and the events of Winter Soldier to know why being controlled and constrained by a higher entity could have dangerous consequences. Cap has his moral compass, and he knows that's the only thing he can trust. On the other hand, Iron Man is dealing with the consequences of his behavior since the first movie (or even since the death of his parents), and he knows he needs guidance. And saying its understandable why Tony goes ballistic against Bucky at the end is understating it. Connected to all that, RDJ's acting in the film was superb. I think the fact that there's a debate going on in this thread and elsewhere on whether Cap or Iron Man was right shows how well the writers handled the two sides.


This is what I liked most about this movie. In many films films conflict is created by having one side being unreasonably stubborn. Or perhaps there'red by some crazy misunderstanding that made them go against each other but once that was resolved everything would be okay. 

Here all sides of the conflict were sympathetic, even the villains. And the reasons the heroes were pitted against each other ran far deeper than simple misunderstandings. They really reached deep into each characters' personality.

No, Zemo set that up. He left the psychiatrist's body and the Bucky prosthesis mask in his hotel room for the room service lady to find (although we didn't see the mask on camera.

I'm surprised no one questions Iron Man for recruiting a kid and bringing him to a very dangerous situation. Of course, I'm not complaining about their inclusion in the film, just that it could have been fleshed out a bit more.

I think that's basically the reason. If one of your heroes/idols showed up to your door and asked for your help, I think most people would take them up on it. It might seem lacking, but I don't have an issue with them because I think that's motivation enough for what they were doing (nothing too ridiculous, and antman was already an outlaw). 

>I don't understand what Zemo would have done if Captain America and Iron Man hadn't arrived at the same time. Even if he could have anticipated that Captain America and Bucky would eventually find the base, there's no way he could have known when Iron Man would have arrived.

I hear this a lot, and it is warranted. But I think people have to understand that Zemo did not know about the entire civil war business. From his point of view, Ironman and Captain America are still working together on the same team and would probably arrive together to a high profile mission like this. He didn't know that they were in a disagreement, and assumed they would arrive together. ",4i35uf

Of course, I'm not complaining about their inclusion in the film, just that it could have been fleshed out a bit more.

I think the bug heroes both joined to help ""the little guy"". Ant-Man having a general distrust of Starks and large Gov ops instilled in him from Hank Pym, and Spider-Man from a general awe of Iron Man and the fact that Tony even reached out to him ""I'm trying to impress Mr. Stark"". 

The fight Spider-Man was in was more of a show of force on each side (well, Idk about Wanda) and everyone was pulling their punches. So while people may have made comments about his age, they knew the intention of the fight was to incapacitate not injure, shown by the immediate side-lining of Spider-Man by Tony when he got hurt and the concern of both Tony and Falcon when Iron Patriot got shot down.

>I don't understand what Zemo would have done if Captain America and Iron Man hadn't arrived at the same time. Even if he could have anticipated that Captain America and Bucky would eventually find the base, there's no way he could have known when Iron Man would have arrived.

If Iron Man hadn't of shown up I assume Zemo would've used the code phrase to make Cap and Bucky fight until either the bread crumbs he left for the UN led the rest of the Avengers to them or one of them is killed and that alone would probably drive further descension in the Avengers. ",4i35uf

Even though Tony went there as a friend and the film was set up for us to expect the three of them vs five Winter Soldiers, the trailer had already shown that another Cap and WS vs IM fight was remaining, so a bit of the surprise was definitely lost.

The Cap was the central character in this movie. True, there are very many characters in this movie and Stark (Stank) is a very important one. But the movie itself revolved around Captain America and his struggle to reconcile his sense of morality with the changing world around him, as well as the changing perspective of the Avengers as a whole.

The landscape has changed in Civil War in a similar fashion to the landscape after Winter Soldier: Now you have 116 governments from around the world who are actively trying to catch and incarcerate superheroes who don't do things their way, Capt. Rogers and his friends are fugitives hiding in Wakanda. Mr. Stark and his team are now essentially a branch of the military. 

It's setup in a way, that only a potentially world ending invasion by Thanos can unite them again. ",4i35uf

The Black Panther has decided to set aside his anger toward Bucky and recognizes that, like his father, Bucky was also a victim.

Cap mentions that if they find out Bucky is there, they'll come for him and T'Challa says let them try. Cuts to a huge black panther in the jungle carved out of black volcanic glass - maybe raw vibranium?

She has an ice pack for Peter's eye and asks again who he got into a fight with. He says it was with a guy from Brooklyn and his very, very big friend.

Like, they might split it into 2 films, but Civil War would be the Avengers film...then you'd have all the solo films to show how people are reacting to it and how it affects them on a personal level.

When they face off at the airport, Cap does try to tell Tony what the problem is, but Tony insists that if anything is done about it, it'll be through official channels, which Cap realizes is far too slow to stop Zemo from getting to the bunker in time.

The Avengers are responsible for aliens attacking New York now?  Yeah, okay.

> I'm not super comic book savvy, but are they setting up a 15 year old kid as potentially more powerful than 90% of the Avengers? That's a brave decision!

Yes, and Spider-Man will be the poster boy of the MCU as the original actors age out of their roles.

> Is this the same Baron Zemo from the Thunderbolts comic? He seemed a bit different. Definitely the best villain Marvel has done yet. So very human and relatable.

Basically the same character sans the Nazi links.  Also, he is just some guy who did bad things as a soldier and wanted to settle down to build a good life for his family before the Avengers indirectly messed it all up.

They made Civil War with 12 heroes, and started/wrapped it up in maybe an hour of screen time. Civil War shouldn't be so light and breezy (""we're still friends right?""), and I think having it end with everyone kiss and make up kinda kills the epic scale this event should've been.

However, personally I'd disagree with Tony bringing in Peter as a contradiction to his character.

In the world of science he's the smartest person on the planet, or close to it. He can probably solve every problem when given enough time.

They explain in the movie what the accords amount to. The Avengers do whatever the UN says (whether they like it or not) can can't act on their own. It was a tight leash. There is a meme floating around about how this was a really bad idea. Suits tried to nuke NYC. Suits approved the Hyrda plan on helicarriers that could assassinate anyone on a list without letting the Avengers know about it. Suits keep fucking up and this movie framed it as if all these problems were caused by the Avengers. Tony caused Sokovia by inventing Ultron, but that was the attempt to retire the Avengers and put the power back in the government. Look how well that worked.

The movie is written such that Cap isn't entirely sure about his decision to oppose the Accords. Cap almost signed the Accords at one point so the speech doesn't fit Cap in MCU.

They are not on American soil and they have no authority what so ever. I don't think Avengers have done anything at this point to earn Europe's trust. (Thor messing up UK? donno...)

The issue is that Sony's reboot never sets Spiderman up for Civil War so Spiderman can't be in the pivotal role.

> And tony wants to sign them because one kid got killed in Sokovia ""because of the Avengers"" when if it weren't for them the whole world would have been destroyed.

Tony's reasoning is completely in line with how he evolved from Iron Man 1. He started as a weapon manufacturer, realized the damage he has done with his work and tries to make up for that. He realizes the outer space threats that Earth will have to face in the future (Avengers 1) and thinks he can protect the whole world by himself (Avengers 2). Ultron kills a lot of people and Tony realizes that he fucked up. So he wants himself and the Avengers to be put in check. The confrontation with the woman that lost her son in Sokovia isn't the whole reasoning for Tony's behaviour, it's just another reason in the whole chain of things. It's putting a face on a whole lot of people that died because Tony fucked up by creating Ultron.",4i35uf

Zemu's character was a little chilched, but at least his villainy is logical.

d2w4xyw,Not even remotely true. Lol,4i35uf
d2wki1d,"I'm gonna respond to each of your points with my opinion as to why certain stuff happened.  
  
1.  Did you ever read about some of the history behind WW1?  One of the big parts was the fact that each country made alliances and friendships so that when shit went down they could call on each other for support.  This was the same way.  Both sides were starting to draw a line in the sand and call upon all their allies to lend support to their claim.  Spiderman and Antman were both HUGE parts of the Marvel Universe and I'm sure you could see just how powerful they are (Giantman mode, and Spidey easily taking on Bucky and Falcon at once).  So they were obvious picks by each of the team Captains.  
  
2.   The whole airport fight was more about dueling ideologies.  It wasn't a war yet.  It was more of a ""ok, we beat you guys and you gotta cut your shit"" situation.  It was obvious that they were all still friends with each other and didn't want to actually harm each other so it was more lighthearted.  The only one at the time looking for blood was Black Panther, who wanted to kill Bucky.  NOW the second fight was smaller in scale BUT had waaaaaay higher stakes.  Tony Stark just watch his parents brutally murdered by Bucky and flashed RED.  He wasn't playing anymore, gloves were off.  He wanted to Kill Bucky.  It was for much greater stakes and even though everyone survived the Avengers are far more broken because of that which leads me to the next point.  
  
3.   Tony Stark and Captain America are no longer friend in Stark's mind.  He still wants blood and he sees Captain America as a traiter protecting the man who killed to parents.  He is acting purely on emotion.  Captain America, on the other hand, is being more objective.  Bucky is pretty much the only family Cap has left so he can't let anyone kill him and wants to save him.  Also, Cap realizes that Bucky was not himself and was a slave to Hydra.  Bucky is just as much a victim as Tony's parents, but in a different way.  However, he understands that seeing someone murder your parents would drive almost anyone into a murderous rage so he understands where Tony is coming from.  The letter was an olive branch to Tony at the end, if he should ever need them.  I don't think Cap expects Tony to call on them unless things become really really dire.  
  
4.   Obviously Captain America posed as a pizza delivery boy and when they opened the prison to pay for the pizza, Cap was like, ""do you mind if I use the restroom, this was a long drive"".  After tricking them he got inside and broke them out. Obviously, I could be mistaken but I think we can all agree that this is the most realistic answer.",4i35uf

It wasn't a death, it was a break-up. They didn't need to sacrifice anyone's life because it was the friendship that was sacrificed, and in a way that was more tragic.

I mean it made a lot more sense than having one of your most iconic characters killed off when it's obvious they're gonna have to be brought back for the next two team up movies leaving you with very little emotional impact other than a little confused about what if any major issues were resolved between the two contrasting heroes other than the first name of both their mothers...",4i35uf

Cap was right that people were afraid of them and just looking for an excuse to stick them in a giant underwater prison and forget about them, and the whole 'we need oversight' thing was just an excuse.

In the comics, Captain is against it because it turns good people into villains in the eyes of the government while being an extremely invasive law to the privacy of super heroes. In the movie he chooses to be against the registration because he's already seen bureaucracy be corrupted with SHIELD secretly being invaded by Hydra.

The thing about Captain in both instances, though, is that he doesn't believe in just blindly following the establishment.

It's easy, from an outsider's perspective to use that logic and question why he still went for Bucky's throat but when you are in the heat of a moment and you see footage of your parents being brutally murdered and the murderer is merely several feet from you, you don't think logically at the moment and your raw emotion does the talking.

Look at the film lineup from here on until Avengers. 

Doctor Strange: new hero, unknown what will happen. I am sure Strange signing depends on how massive his battle will be and how many people know of his power. If people find out about him, the Accords come into play.

Thor: Is on another world at this point. Can go about as he pleases until he shows up on earth.

Spider-Man: I am guessing he agrees with Tony, is safety netted with him. 

Black Panther: This is where things get interesting. If some of our heroes are in Wakanda, what is Black Panther is going to do about holding Bucky against the world's policy?

The only glaring issue with timing is that Cap and Bucky take that supersonic Jet on what we assume is a direct flight to Siberia. Meanwhile in that time Tony takes Rhodes back, watches his operation and goes to the Raft only to be around 15 minutes behind Cap when he gets to Siberia.",4i35uf

Until Tony got angry because the Winter Soldier killed his mom did we see any true emotion.  And man people around here bitched when Superman said Save Martha.   That showed Batman he had humanity.  But oh well, I had to wake my wife up twice, which is not a good sign. ",4i35uf

You could have taken out the Accord, and it wouldn't have changed any of the events after the UN bombing. Captain would still be called in as a fugitive for trying to help a world terrorist escape, Cap would have *still* gone into hiding after re-capturing Bucky, etc. Literally all it does in the movie is allow the UN to control the Avengers as SHIELD controlled them pre-Winter Soldier.

While they did bump up Scarlet Witch's powers a bit compared to AoU, she has been nerfed HARD in this universe.

He needed just those there because otherwise you have people who could stand them down and stop the fighting. Or without all the initial tensions between the two sides. 

The 5 soldiers was essentially just the same as saying 'Oh he's going for X collection of Nukes that don't exist on record so the government won't believe Cap when he says they exist.' It could have been any world ending threat - He just needed something to get the right people in place. Zemo using any actual conventional threat wouldn't have worked with his plan - Because it would give the two something to unify against when he wanted to fracture them forever.

We don't know when he learned the location of the base but we also don't see their conversation, and my guess is that it was at the same time.  Bucky was probably instructed to break out and meet him there later.

The characters assume he's headed there to wake up the rest of the Winter Soldiers, but we're never actually shown that at all.  What he's actually spent his time doing is looking through the records for proof that he can throw in Tony's face and finish driving the wedge, which turns out to be the video.  The video's pretty overly convenient, but it's a movie and showing Tony pore through a detailed mission report is probably not a great option. :P

The five additional Winter Soldiers are misdirection, but either way he still needed to go there if he wanted real proof of what happened.

* He found/infiltrated the base using the Winter Solider cheat book.
* The only resources he needs are brains and money. Not unbelievable imo.
* What could he have not done by himself?
* His plan was convoluted because the only way to destroy the Avengers was by making them destroy each other. He formed his plan after learning that Winter Soldier was responsible for the Starks' accident, and had to get Cap and Tony in the same room to show the evidence.",4i35uf

d2wfwor,"Makes me sad that people are downvoting you because they simply disagree. Then again, it is reddit and comic books are king. Still, I'd like to have some discussion about what was good and what was bad in this film.

Anyway, about your points. I agree with half of your point 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9. And the final point. A much better film than Ultron but still not as good as Winter Soldier. This definitely felt more like an Avengers film. Too many characters, to include way too much spider-man. And I don't buy that ""we're seriously understaffed"" line to justify bringing in *one* more superhero. It's a shoehorn to generate more films. That is its only purpose, as any sane filmgoer would agree that the film would have been *much* better served by going with fewer characters.

I don't think Howard was a better War Machine than Cheadle. Cheadle is a great actor but he isn't really given much to work with in this film. Again the film suffers from being over-stuffed. But it really could have been worse. Considering the huge cast (12 main characters...I mean holy shit) they pulled it off really well. But it still felt overlong and bloated, and a solid edit would have made this film great.

I also disagree about the Panther scenes. I thought they did a fairly decent job introducing him considering every new character arc detracts from Cap. Again I dislike this method of stuffing more characters into the MCU films. I understand it is necessary because of this upcoming Infinity War silliness with 2384723 characters, but that's really a thing for the comic books. The comic books have an audience that really enjoys digging into this minutiae with so many extraneous details, but for film it doesn't really work. I don't think I'll be watching Infinity War (getting comic film fatigue at this point) but I'm curious to read the reviews to see how they try and pull it off.

Winter Soldier remains my favorite MCU film.",4i35uf

>It's like the creative team at Marvel got an early look at Batman v Superman and took it upon themselves to show the executives at Warner Bros. how to make a superhero-versus-superhero film built on many of the same themes as Batman v Superman but that isn't a dark hurricane of disappointment and stink.

This movie delivered on every level that BvS didn't. Character invesment. Thematic depth. Fantastic character introductions.

I love how they took advantage of audience knowledge of Spider Man by making his origin subtext. And making it that much more powerful, and thematically relevant. It was like a shot at DC for doing the same old Bruce Wayne parent deaths. 

I guess my only quirk with that was that Spiderman's story plays PERFECTLY into Cap's perspective, and they should have had Cap change his mind.

For all we know, a UN representative is going to show up at Spidey's house tomorrow with a document for him to sign telling him that he can sign (and basically lose his anonymity), retire or go to jail.

He has him stay back and out of sight unless he's needed, and the way Tony envisions him being ""needed"" is to web up Cap and take the shield which he figures will end the will to fight (Tony puts way too much belief into that shield, probably related to his father having made it). Even when it's clear they WILL fight, he explicitly tells Spider-Man to keep his distance and just web people up. It's Spider-Man, who knows much better what he can do, that actually gets into the fight on his own. Not that Stark doesn't seem OK with it, but you know, at that point it's an all-out brawl.

Also, so long as Peter is stuck in NYC, he shouldn't need to worry about signing the Accords, since those are not only just about the Avengers, but also are based around crossing borders to operate without clearance. And Spider-Man doesn't have the resources for that.",4i35uf

Uh I got nothing on this except it's Tony Stark.

>Why did they have to get a specific aircraft to go to Siberia?

They had a helicopter waiting for them, probably Hawkeye prepared. When it was disabled they went with the Quinjet.

So is a making a man-made or robot-made meteor.

>I've heard that the comic book also shares the flaw but the fact of the matter is that Tony comes off as completely unlikable and it's clear that Cap is right. Sure, he has a great character arc and has justifiable reasons but he comes of as a complete asshole, imprisoning Scarlet Witch and trying to kill Bucky after finding out he killed his parents. His position is just indefensible.

He wasn't aware the condition there were in were for criminals not for heroes like them.  His even shock to see SW in a straight jacket.  He wasn't in charge of the prison.

>Martin Freeman's scene with Zemo was cliche. If you get out of line, I'll punish you. Please get out of line.

I don't what this is except your opinion and not a character fault.

>The entire ordeal could have been solved so easily if when they were at the airport, Tony just let Steve explain the thing about Helmut Zemo and his reasons, but I guess that a relatively forced battle was more fun. After just a few seconds, he just says enough and calls Spiderman. Zemo's plan in general was a bit too long-winded.

Cap tried to explained but Tony think it's just BS. Watched the scene again.

>The Ant-Man movie established that Ant-Man's mass stays the same when he gets smaller and thus he has the same strength but it's just more concentrated. So if he has the same strength, how come when he's big, he can create dents in airplanes and whatnot.

Pym Particles. Plus how come Hank Pym can carry a miniaturized tank and still be able to move. Chock it up as comic-book logic.

>The movie never mentions how much time has passed since the last movie. It doesn't really change anything but I'm curious.

A year has pass. Zemo says his been studying the Avengers for over a year since his family died at Sokovia.

>Captain America didn't actually know that Bucky killed Tony's parents. In the last movie, Zola simply explains that Hydra has killed people and one of the pictures is of Howard Stark. That's it.

If you have followed the Iron Man movies, you can see this underlying theme of guilt, panic, and overwhelming pressure mounting on Stark. He kicks off this whole super hero wave, died (briefly) during the New York invasion, and was already dealing with the PTSD in Iron Man 3 and had already decided to wreck the suits before he lost Pepper. Then Ultron happened, and the Hulkbuster fight and all the collateral damage that entailed. By the time the Accords are introduced, Stark is just at the end of his rope.
  Here is a guy that thought he had it figured out, that by ending Stark Industries' weapon division and becoming IM he solved the world's war problem, but it has only gotten and is getting worse all the time. Add to it that the majority of the Avengers are warriors/soldiers and accustomed to loss of life to accomplish peace, and with Banner's loss of trust over Ultron, he has had to shoulder this guilt alone. It's really no surprise that he has taken this stance, and I felt the directors did a great job of presenting him and his side of it well.",4i35uf
d2wwn99,"> The submerged prison in the middle of the ocean was kind of unrealistic.

It's a superhero movie and you post something like this?  Come on now man.  Lol.

I actually thought it was pretty fucking badass and ingenious myself.  I mean shit, even Captain America couldn't swim to shore from the middle of the ocean, so it's the perfect prison for superheroes.
",4i35uf
d311giz,"- Tony probably knew if he explained the issues to Spidey that he wouldn't take his side, since the things Spidey said were his motivation to be a hero were the same things Steve was saying about why he wouldn't sign.

- Clearly they'd tracked Clint (or, less likely, Steve) to the airport (remember the satellites they had doing the search?) which is why within minutes of them meeting up the airport got evacuated.

- They didn't need a specific aircraft. The chopper they were going for was just what they'd organised so they wouldn't need to steal a plane. The Quinjet they picked because that's how Team Iron Man got there, it'd strand them there somewhat, and the quinjet is cloakable so they could get to Siberia without being followed.

- It's The Raft. It's more realistic than building a prison in the Negative Zone.

- They do a better job with Tony in this. In the comic he basically goes full Hitler on everyone, imprisons heroes in a prison in the negative zone that will slowly drive them insane, recruits super villains, etc. In this one you could see him stressing out and trying harder and harder to keep the family together until he snaps and goes all murder-happy at the end. And while, to you and I, that scene makes Team Iron Man automatically the bad guys here, I've been in a debate for most of the last day with a guy claiming that Tony is in the right even with the attempted murder, so apparently there's still some interpretation there.

- Eh, we hadn't really gotten to know Freeman's character much, all we know is he seems to enjoy his job a little too much for a guy with that serious a job.

- Steve explained the reasons, and Tony's only response was to say to surrender anyway. By that point Tony was on the clock, and thanks to the idiocy of the Accords, he was in too deep to back out, so when Steve won't stand down his alternative is to go for the non-lethal containment (Spider-Man) which, clearly, doesn't go that well.

- Magic. (seriously though, there's a big post someone's quoted a few times with someone explaining it, but basically the gist is 'the Thomas train and the ant in Ant Man didn't lose all their mass, so Lang wouldn't either')

- Yeah, which is exactly what Steve says. Tony: ""Did you know?"" Steve: ""I didn't know it was him...""

- What bullet hole? Bucky didn't shoot him. The car went off the road after Bucky punched his metal fist through the window, and then he punched Howard in the face twice with enhanced strength to make it look like blunt-force trauma from the steering wheel. The bit that would have looked off to anyone who suspected foul play would be the open trunk, and the fact that Tony's mother was strangled. That said, I don't think we really needed the image of the Soldier grabbing her by the head and slamming her into the dashboard after the brutal death of Howard, just to keep things realistic.",4i35uf

d2upls9,"Speaking of fanservice, the direct quote in the eulogy was pretty bad ass.",4i35uf
d2up218,The villain's reveal was more to wrap up Black Panther's arc.  Panther realized how vengeance had consumed Zemo and realized he himself was controlled by it too.,4i35uf
d2usa4u,"Really? I thought the villain's reveal was an amazing subversion of your traditional superhero tropes.

Throughout the movie, we were expecting some convoluted, nefarious villain's motivation about ruling the world or destroying the world, especially since we were fed the red herring of the 5 other Winter Soldiers.

Instead, what we got was a simple, relatively average man who just wanted revenge. He didn't have amazing powers or resources, he just had indomitable will and a grudge.

It tied in extremely well with the themes of revenge present with Tony and T'Challa's characters.

I also love that he actually won and after completing his goals, he was willing to throw his life away as he had nothing left to live for. A surprisingly dark and mature take on the character.",4i35uf

d2uwk8k,"I definitely see what you're saying and Cap perfectly brings this fact up when he's fighting Spider-Man. Along the lines of ""Is that /all/ he told you?"". Tony used his power/stardom to woo a kid and you can tell Peter has no idea how serious or deadly the game is. He's up against one of the most deadly assassins and comments on his awesome arm. Tony had no right. 

Albeit...it was pretty freakin' awesome and hilarious. ",4i35uf
d2uy34o,"So there is 2D screening, I just saw one. Hawkeye joins them because Cap called him up. When he breaks into the compound, he says he was supposed to be on vacation with his family. When he's reunited with Cap, Cap says he called him up. ",4i35uf

As for Tony, I do think he does things in a more self centered and emotional tone. He's already mentally unbalanced as is, but when he's confronted by people blaming him for deaths, obviously he is going to go the deep end more extremely than most heroes.",4i35uf
d2vo55s,"Your reasoning is exactly why I thought Captain America was right. The whole concept of the accords just seemed shady. Cap summed it up perfectly that the governments will send them to situations they dont agree with(quasi-invasions basically), and prevent them from going to places that actually need saving.


As for the BvS part, the whole idea was that Batman does not trust superman because he doesnt know if superman will just day go pure dictator mode and no one will be able to stop him. They just did not explain that well.",4i35uf
d2vp01i,"I don't think it was Tony being able to say ""Just following orders"" because when they were left to their (namely his) own devices, he nearly destroyed the Earth with Ultron and there were severe consequences to that with countless innocent people dying DIRECTLY because of Tony's creation. I think he feels a ton of guilt. Because it's not like Man of Steel, it's not from some other entity or some otherworldly force like Loki or what Thanos will be or what Zod was, but directly because of Tony's actions and creations those people died and an entire city was destroyed. It was because of him toying with stuff he didn't entirely comprehend. ",4i35uf
d2vrhvf,"Pointless deaths for impact serve no purpose. People are used to that kind of thing thanks to shows like GoT and the recent movies like The Force Awakens and BvS.

d2vzlbc,"Spider-Man and Ant Man are clearly a very fun part of the movie, and obviously fan favorites, but I was impressed with Black Panther, he's a character with great gravitas and amazing fighting skills.  Chadwick Boseman did a fantastic job.",4i35uf
d2w0qib,"Like everyone else, I loved Spider-Man, ant-man and the black panther. I also loved Vision and Falcon - they were the funniest characters to me, and Vision looked great. ",4i35uf
d2w2x1o,"Easy Black Panther is the coolest. His claws and how he fights are spot on a panther. He is basically like the comic. A semi dick.

Spider was awesome and nailed the youth of Peter Parker. Seriously there is a good future in that casting.

IMO though the best was Ant Man. He lived UP to everything I wanted from the comic and his 1 liners are just really dam funny. Paul Rudd was the perfect humor needed.

Ya Black Panther is just an amazing character. Makes me wish for Black Bolt and other characters.

d2x2xnb,"I think the writers didn't know what to do with Vision. No one on Caps' team could match Vision's power, except Scarlet Witch. But Scarlet already fought Vision so the writers didn't want a rematch. Plus it's more interesting to see Scarlet fight other people on Tony's team.

d2x5fqv,I agree with you. I was hoping Tony was going to burn the letter or break the phone.,4i35uf

Also, steve's letter didn't fix everything. Tony was willing to let the imprisoned avengers be rescued. The anger he feels towards the winter soldier wasn't resolved. He merely had time and distance to recognize that half the avengers that helped steve didn't deserve to be locked away, and had enough time to cool down and not try to kill bucky for something he was brainwashed into doing.

Oh and winter soldier being frozen? That's captain america acknowledging that his friend is broken, and needs to be contained. The only way being frozen is better than being imprisoned is that bucky doesn't half to suffer the time he's imprisoned, and bucky DOESNT deserve to be imprisoned. He was the biggest victim of them all, even more so than tony's parents.",4i35uf
d2v3oir,"Zemo should have let those soldiers out and THEN showed Tony the footage after they were all exhausted from the team up battle. Black Panther could have been involved in that fight too before chasing Zemo because he doesn't care about Bucky anymore.

d2v2jl7,Yes. And the fact that Tony held Bucky responsible even though he knew he was mind controlled made the climax fight seem stupid.,4i35uf
d2v34xz,"As someone mentioned it in the thread it was intentionally implicit. We know that Tony Stark is a very resourceful person, owns probably the most advanced satellites in the world and has a really powerful AI, so to track a kid with the superpowers who went viral on YouTube wasn't something he would have a particular problem with. And to add to that, it is unlikely that he made him a suit overnight so I think he had an eye for Peter for a quite some time. ",4i35uf

In this, he was trying to work the middle ground between Ross and Cap, and honestly if Cap had gone along with tony, they could have done what they wanted to and bent the rules when they had to, cap is just too black and white to do that. Then when Tony figured out it was Zemo setting up the initial conflict he was back on their side. It was only knowing that Bucky murdered his folks he went in to a blind rage for revenge ",4i35uf

well they all but told us in CA:TWS",4i35uf

d2vxgpq,"Yeah I hear you, it's funny to think when he's telling Natasha ""In my culture, death is not the end, it's a stepping stone."" But then he's like ""you know what fuck it, I'm going to go kill this guy who killed my father anyway and ditch all my presidential duties."" ",4i35uf
d2vwezc,"I think you should give him another shot, theres a lot of cool stuff there.",4i35uf

If we are going to talk about something as surface level as that, then I would like to add that he has an awesome, and different fighting style that uses kicking a bit more, and he leaps around and stuff and it's really cool. That triple kick thing was amazing. And yeah, he is a king. That is so cool! Of some nation we've barely heard anything of. 

But, what people are actually liking him for is his awesome character arc which was handled so well. His thirst for vengeance, and eventual rejection of it is heroic, and speaks to the larger thematic elements of the movie. And Chadwick Boseman is amazing in the role, all quiet dignity and rage. Loved him",4i35uf
d2xhrnx,"I never can get invested with the openings of these movies because there's no story to follow which makes the action meaningless.  I can't say I'm a fan of Marvel's ""get to the action immediately"" method, but soon as the story actually started it was good.

Actually, it did tie in the story;  the point was to set up Wanda's development and how other characters felt.  It also let the senator have his chance to get the Avengers to sign the papers.  It was important despite being the hardest part to get invested in because of how little emotion had been shown thus far.",4i35uf

The whole point of the story is that there is a philosophical difference between the two (Iron Man, Captain America). Neither is definitively right or wrong, it is highly subjective.

Remind you of anything?

Tony Stark is dealing with a shitton of PTSD and wants to try and put some of the blame off on the government. He doesn't want to be responsible for his own actions, he wants someone else to take the blame so he can keep living the carefree lifestyle and not hate himself for each life lost every time he closes his eyes. Tony was never a soldier, never a brainwashed secret agent, he's just a dude who realised halfway through his life how muh damage he was doing to the world. ",4i35uf

d2uoani,5th? I think is 2nd or 3rd to me (after The Avengers).,4i35uf
d2uq4tn,"> Tony was too willing to let the government control the heroes without limitations.

They made it clear very early that Tony feels personally culpable for a lot of the collateral damage (and he should) when the state department employee tells her about her dead son. She says you can't spend money to assuage your guilt, and this really pushes Tony to a decision he might not have made otherwise.

>Cap decided the one person who would never be able to publicly be an Avenger was worth bringing the ship down for.

After the events of Winter Soldier, Cap doesn't trust any government, just people. It's totally in his character to what's right (save an individual) instead of just following orders.

>And there was a camera, mysteriously, where the Winter Soldier killed the Starks. So much for no witnesses.

One of Hydra's most potent weapons is information, so it would make sense that Bucky took the camera footage for use at some later date.

>And Tony, upon seeing the footage loses all sense of reason as one of the smartest people alive.

Tony's intelligent, but he's emotional and he's shown some pretty bad judgement over the course of the series.",4i35uf
d2usmzy,"I think with the point about Tony seeing the footage, keep in mind that throughout the films Stark has been shown time and time again to be emotional, reckless and at times wildly irrational. 

It was shown at the start of the movie and in his other films that he hadn't coped particularly well with the deaths of his parents and it left him scarred for life. 

In that last scene, he saw his parents being BRUTALLY murdered.

d2x5yld,"One thing I feel the movie did a really poor job was explaining what exactly the Accords were. At times it seemed to be something specifically targeting The Avengers, while at other times it seemed to be much closer to the Super Hero Registration Act of the comics, in which people with super powers/secret identities needed to register with the government.

That said, [this scene from an upcoming episode of Agents of SHIELD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvAUb7-yFJY) seems to suggest that the Accords do, in fact, function much closer to the Super Hero Registration Act. In that being a super hero doesn't require you to fly out to the UN and sign an official document, but you *do* have to register yourself with the UN. So if Parker did have to sign something, which was still unmentioned in the movie, then it most likely wasn't the very public Accord document itself, but likely a private registration with the UN.

That said, I feel like we didn't see/hear this in the movie because it simply didn't happen.

That is subjective to the individual viewers. If you never care those characters before, this movie is not going to change your mind. The movie is written specifically to ride on existing fandom hence TeamCap or TeamIronman. 

> The death of Tony's parents should've happened earlier in the movie

Disagreed. The movie works because Tony isn't vengeful from the start. A simple revenge plot would not accomplish much for the movie. Tony starts with supporting the government/Accords. He then has a temporarily truce with TeamCap after witnessing the treatment of heroes at the Raft; finally he snaps when he learns about the '91 murders. The moral ambiguity makes the movie interesting. 

> The movie just felt like filler to a pay off that will never come

The ""pay off"" is the relationship changes. Subsequent movies will build on the event in Civil War so it is adding more drama among the characters in MCU

Steve has a really good understand of his teammates, where they fall in the scheme of things, and how much they can be trusted. Tony does not, mostly due to his own fears and weaknesses.

I do think, however, that the biggest problem was that they really didn't spend enough time arguing the finer points of what the accords mean, and the implications and problems that arise. I think the evidence for what these points would be is woven into the movie through the unfolding of events, but it would have helped sell this as Cap movie if he had given a few more poignant lines on the subject in his debates. The fact that the final scene was more about the personal, emotional brawl between the characters (which, to be fair, was for almost every hero the underlying reason that they did or did not sign the accords - save Captain America and Black Widow, Rhodey, and maybe Vision) didn't help.

I was okay with the level of things in Winter Soldier, mostly because Cap's one-liner to Fury: ""this isn't freedom, this is fear"" kind of nailed the point, but I do think in Civil War there should have been a more active discussion of the real problems, not just the personal ones.

I didn't feel challenged at all by it and this is coming from a guy who's two favourite superheroes are Batman and Superman. We saw no clash between ideologies of them which is what I wanted from that film.

However, with Civil War, I came in supporting Captain America's agenda but came out on the side of Iron Man. The person I saw it with had the exact opposite reaction. If you read the reactions throughout this thread and from critics, it seems to be almost perfectly split down the middle. If that's not evidence of a balanced portrayal of two starkly differing moral viewpoints, I don't know what is.",4i35uf

For me I think you can see a lot of this in how the US has been using drones/special forces in their persecution of the war on terror. When things go wrong people are justifiably upset, especially the victims of those killed. When things go right, like in the bin Laden raid, we can understand why the US acted unilaterally and without prior consent of Pakistan (as tipping off the Pakistanis likely wild mean tipping off bin Laden as well).",4i35uf

d316q3v,"For most longtime comicbook fans and critics, the comicbook version of Civil War was a huge disappointment. It was a great idea but unfortunately, it ended up being a convoluted, poorly written mess that forced almost all characters involved to act like caricatures of themselves complete with hammy, stilted dialogue and wild departures from established characterisation with very little build up.

I just wanted to get that out of the way so I could tell you why as a comic book fan and as a movie fan, Civil War was so enjoyable for me. 

In the comics, they inexplicably turned Tony Stark into a nefarious, moustache twirling villain who went from a reasonable, troubled man in the first half to a story to a full blown fascist seemingly at the drop of a hat. In Civil War, we see Tony's point of view more clearly and what's more, we're actually able to sympathise with him and see the shades of grey in both sides of the argument.

Tony isn't painted as the villain in this version and in fact, the fan base seems to be almost perfectly split on which side is ""right"". There are many fans and critics who have come into the movie with a bias towards Captain America and come out on the side of Iron Man. There are also many fans and critics with a bias towards Iron Man that have come out on the side of Captain America. This reaction should show you just how well balanced both sides were in the film.

With regards to Captain America's speech from the comics, as a Captain America fan, I've always hated that speech. It's borderline supervillainesque and I think it's a fundamental misunderstanding of the character. Imagine if that speech was said by Doctor Doom or Magneto. It would make perfect sense for their character. Not for the Captain America that I know. 

However, the way the movie did it, by giving that line to someone else, it actually improves it quite a bit. It no longer is an out of character speech that completely misinterprets Cap as a character. It's instead a speech that influences Cap and sets him on his path throughout the rest of the film - whether that be the right path or not. Judging from the way his actions are portrayed, that path might just have been the wrong one - and I love that ambiguity.",4i35uf

It's ok popcorn-cinema for the dull masses, but let's be honest... you're watching basically the same movie for over 8 years. Also calling the characters and storytelling ""quality"" is a fucking joke. A random-ass-nobody-gives-a-shit-about plot device here, an army of faceless enemies to bash there, add the lack of a proper villain and the characters themselves that only work for the audience because they are desperately trying to be liked. One dull quip after the other. Some cheeky banter and a bit of bromance and ready is basically the equivalent to romantic comedies for guys from 15 to 25.

d2v143a,"I think it exposes DC's misstep in trying to create a shared universe through one film. They made a Superman film, Avengers hit hard...and they went right into making the Justice League in one film. Now, Marvel might have just fell into Iron Man being a success and setting up an Avengers movie, but they set it up. They then took a road map and figured out how to go down the road in a proper fashion.

Seeing a movie in which the heroes fight each other within 2 hours of meeting for the first time, while bringing every other hero from your universe to it, is rushing so much stuff. You have to masterfully craft that film for it to not feel rushed or convoluted. Let alone, find a resolution that you can then properly work with for the next big iterations of your heroes stand-alone films/collaborative films.

Marvel took 15(?) movies to get themselves to a breaking point of Stark and Rogers not seeing eye to eye. There are actions and dialogues in each of their stand alone movies that show ideological differences between the two. When they're together, their ideas clash multiple times. Even when they're not talking about the end all be all solutions or problems, they have issues with how they see the world. Stark walks into a conversation with Rogers viewing him in a very specific light, and Rogers does the same thing to Stark. They might be able to work together. They might respect each other. We've still spent years seeing that the two men can get under each other's skin with how they view the world.",4i35uf

Uh? The whole structure of the Avengers changed.

I don't really agree here. I don't think Cap and Iron Man are on good terms at all. Tony getting the phone at the end was just typical Captain America-thing to do. Cap knows they'll need each other sooner or later, the world will need the Avengers, so he leaves a way for Stark to contact him. 

The friction between the characters is still there, the Russos just dialed it up a notch and spread it out to include more characters. I don't know if Starks ego will let him use that phone. Sure it took a beating during Age of Ultron and Civil War but it's still there. Because the ego *is* Tony Stark.

I'm not sure if the final blow from Cap actually disabled the suit or if it only served to prove that he could have killed Stark and chose not to, thus ending the fight.

Bucky says he is more of a passive observer when mind-controlled so when Zemo asked him where the other soldiers were hidden, it would be reasonable to assume that's where he was headed. 

He kills the super-soldiers because he didn't want more insane mind-controlled super-people running around. Which is shockingly reasonable for a villain. 

>And then he'll show Tony the proof, ON THE PRESUMPTION, that Tony doesn't know who killed his parents...  Tony could have been keeping things hush hush in the public eye because he doesn't want to spill secrets like that to the public.

I think you're using a lot of ""maybe he would've done this for these reasons"". It's not unreasonable to assume Tony didn't know his parents were killed. He is terrible at keeping secrets ""I am Iron-Man, here's my address terrorist come and get me!"", so it's in-character that if he knew his parents were killed, there would've been evidence of his knowing.

What if they told the Avengers to intervene in a situation they didn't believe they should, or vice versa? He doesn't want to give up the right (and responsibility) to decide when he should help, and signing the Accords would just be shifting responsibility for their actions onto someone else.

During the scene with Tony after they're captured in Bucharest he is pretty close to signing, with the understanding that the Accords can be amended to allow for his concerns (checks and balances), but ultimately his (understandable) mistrust in authority (particularly off the back of the Bucky situation) wins out.",4i35uf

He waited for the Avengers to tear each other apart and when Iron Man/Cap followed him to Siberia (which was because the body from the hotel turned up... so that's how they figure out what's going on, that the real reason is in Siberia), he finally revealed the truth to Stark.

And he tried to kill himself, when's the last time you see that from a villain? And you get why he would do it too if you pay attention to his character and motivation.

There was no grand evil to unite the team so they could punch evil's dick in and everyone goes home to sip hot chocolate together and be best buddies again.

d2v0n86,"She was in Winter Soldier, they flirted and later he asked her out, didn't he? She wasn't introduced in this movie.",4i35uf
d2vo6dj,"need a better mic, maybe some editing. ",4i35uf
d2xveac,"i dont think its a plot hole, Tony has access to all kinds of surveilance, and this is a rookie spiderman, probably sloppy hiding who he is. ",4i35uf
d2xveto,"It's not explained, sure, but Tony could have easily had cameras/drones whatever follow him. Probably knows identities off all kinds of people. I would have liked just a small line from his AI somewhere in there telling Tony it figured out the identity of one more hero. I think the bigger question is why the hell does Tony want the help of a 16 year old boy when he's already got War Machine and Vision? I've heard people say he could easily manipulate a kid. Some say he wanted some wild card factor. Sure. But he's also putting a kid in danger. ",4i35uf
d2y8unw,"Not exactly a plot hole, just something that doesn't need to be stated.

Stark's been studying the Spider-Man for a while (he said he's had his eye on him). He's a super genius with unlimited resources. Shouldn't be too hard to find the identity of some careless kid.",4i35uf
d2ux6t1,Did you drop a /s or are you just dumb?,4i35uf
d2uy91q,I feel like it had a pretty good amount of action. Certainly more than any other MCU film. ,4i35uf
d2w2y6m,What issues are you talking about?,4i35uf
d2w2yql,care to elaborate? ,4i35uf
d2w34eu,Which are?,4i35uf
d2w32iq,"Cmon man, at least add something to the conversation. Maybe why you think it's a circle jerk? ",4i35uf
d2v9b5r,"It's the US release. It was released Internationally before it was released in the US, so this is the first chance that the technically Domestic fan base got to see the film.",4i35uf
d2vsecw,"not sure what you watched, but it was there.
",4i35uf
d2vshvn,Did you go to the bathroom and miss it or something?,4i35uf
d2vsch3,It was in the movie.,4i35uf
d2vsw5q,that was literally the end fight. ,4i35uf
d2vygn0,"he had the shrapnel removed in the end of iron man 3
",4i35uf
d2vyv4o,Tony successfully removed all of the shrapnel by the end of Iron Man 3,4i35uf
d2xm1qy,That was a horrible review,4i35uf
d2xo4qg,"That's the worst review of anything I've ever heard. ""This movie was formulaic because it had talking, then action"", was basically your criticism. I also don't think I've ever seen anyone misunderstand Spider-Man's character the way you did.",4i35uf
d2wy667,So you judge someone based on power levels not by motivation?,4i35uf
d2x67uk,He's my favourite MCU villain so far.,4i35uf
d2v5jdt,No one is downvoting because they disagree. They're downvoting because you look silly and your comment was hard to read,4i35uf
d2v6rry,"It's not really irony, it's character development. Cap has seen an official government organisation corrupted and almost taking over the world. That's why he's now against handing over the keys to the UN.

Stark is feeling guilty from the Ultron fiasco, and thinks that the Avengers need to answer to someone other than themselves. That's why he's willing to have UN oversight.

Rogers from the start of Captain America: TFA would probably have signed the accords, Stark from Iron Man and Iron Man 2 probably would not have signed.",4i35uf
d2vby5w,"You're weird, dude.",4i35uf
d2vbcvx,Rogers doesn't trust the government at all since WS and Iron Man doubts himself and his motivations and thinks its better if someone tells him what to do. Also your edit was fucking stupid,4i35uf
d2up919,"I mean I loved the movie, but I kind of agree. Rhodey should have bit the dust. ",4i35uf
d2x12v7,"Well American's gave you the movie, so you should be saying thank you instead ",4i35uf
d2vwy6l,"This isn't your blog, nobody cares about your day.",4i35uf
d2vxesb,i disagree. captain america not signing was the smart thing to do. what if it takes one minute too long for the un to decide to fight someone? so many could die. the avengers need to be let free. aunt may was 50+. not that hot to a lot of people.,4i35uf
d2wtt0d,fuck off,4i35uf
d2w17tn,"You're damn right. Meanwhile there are so many big, beautiful, and hellaciously expensive films being made that have horrible screenwriting. ",4i35uf
hj20vu7,"I'm super late but if anyone is reading this and deciding to watch or not , this is it. I put it off for a long time. I think I even saw the original avengers in theater but I never 'liked' marvel movies. My ex was watching civil war and I looked up a couple times , got sucked in when I realized how they were tying together so many arcs in an epic battle. I watched guardians 2 and that was it. I was a convert. I thought I didn't like captain america but his story was really good. It helps that I started ADHD meds and sitting through movies was easier , but medicated or not now I still enjoy them",4i35uf
d39ilgf,"Definitely.. If you add the fact Wanda showed Tony the vision of the Avengers death, it basically, in the easiest way helps the case for OP's post. It goes from the Tony's vision, Tony and Cap's argument in AoU, Sokovia, and right into OP's post =Civil War's plot",4i35uf
d39j02q,"I did feel like some action scenes were really fast.. But I guess production-wise, it have to be. Like in the beginning, Avengers vs Crossbones; the sequence with Black Widow felt unnaturally fast. Obviously I know what she does, but I'm just saying it was hard to follow. And in my perspective, I felt the Cap and Bucky vs Ironman fight went fast too. Just the part where they were tagging up throwing the shield around, seen in one of the movie trailers. I was looking forward to that scene, and it felt like it went pretty fast compared to the trailer. Just my opinion tho ",4i35uf
d31qg10,That's just [vintage RDJ!](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/8d/94/81/8d948129970c713c86882b5315a6f3ff.jpg),4i35uf
d2whgf2,Gillian Jacobs for Captain Marvel,4i35uf
d2wih6a,Dan Harmon as Jonah Jameson,4i35uf
d2w5cti,What if they need a lawyer?,4i35uf
d2x3b91,I hope this doesn't awaken anything in me,4i35uf
d2x3chw,dean ya later!,4i35uf
d33hksj,"Dean Pelton had a very ""not straight"" sexuality that they lampooned being ambiguous all the time and his character in Civil War basically made a dick joke.",4i35uf
d2v1m6n,"""That is awesome dude!""",4i35uf
d2v5er6,"Spidey pulls his punches.  He doesn't go full out, this is actually explored in a couple of different stories.",4i35uf
d2vk5nd,"I laughed in Spider-Man 2 when he finally landed a punch on Doc Ock.  Doc Ock should have been out cold, his a normal dude with awesome arms, nothing about him should be able to stand a punch from spidey. ",4i35uf
d2wk5ky,I believe in the comics Spider Man is rated in whatever they call like the A group of super strength. Other than a few S rankers he's one of the strongest heroes in the Marvel Universe,4i35uf
d2w1ft4,"Eh the raimi trilogy had some pretty huge strength feats, they just didn't demonstrate it in combat.",4i35uf
d2xxzfq,*Spider-Man 2* pretty clearly demonstrated how strong he is when he held onto the webbing halting that runaway train.,4i35uf
d2wtovx,And he's only 15 or 16. Spider-Man iterations get stronger as they get older.,4i35uf
d2v5huh,You can always argue Cap is more strategic and mentally knows how to utilize his body better in a fight. ,4i35uf
d2v609n,Remind me?,4i35uf
d2x3zs3,"Yeah man I loved this movie, but as someone who spends a lot of my time imagining which fictional characters would win which fights, some of the power scalings were totally inconsistent. Particularly during the Bucky escape scene where he gets tagged by CIA Sharon and disarmed by suitless Tony, even though he goes toe to toe with Captain America all the time.",4i35uf
d2wo6a7,Spiders are REALLY fucking strong.,4i35uf
d2x5llf,"Spiderman isn't Superman levels of strong but he's pretty up there.  He's definitely one of the strongest Marvel characters that I can think of besides the Demi-God tier.

",4i35uf
d2uqzm0,aunt bae,4i35uf
d2x27ql,Originally it was his Great Aunt May,4i35uf
d2xi5iz,I'd help her across the street. ,4i35uf
d2uq1bl,Lol Marissa Tomei IS aunt May,4i35uf
d2vv5ml,"For every new Spiderman, Aunt May gets younger and younger. ",4i35uf
d2v0hoe,but knows what an open door signifies,4i35uf
d2vkgkh,I like the implication he's walked in on wanda changing or something.,4i35uf
d2wwzmf,I like how they hint around vision being attracted to Wanda. ,4i35uf
d2vnjgq,Did he have a chain and/or a light beer?,4i35uf
d2vu88u,How would you know Vision isn't circumcised? Is that in the comics?,4i35uf
d2vjiy5,It helps with the aerodynamics.,4i35uf
d2w53di,But the cape...,4i35uf
d2x74sj,Oh it's *very* effective. ,4i35uf
d2v7clf,I would love some vision dick hanging around on the screen,4i35uf
d2x8k5s,"Well Dr. Manhattan did initially wear clothes or created a costume that covered him, but overtime as he distanced himself from humanity he shrunk the costume piece by piece and his sense of modesty to nothing. You can see his costume evolution change I think in the yearly pictures they took.",4i35uf
d2xni49,"Well ya, that's the JARVIS part of him being a British butler.",4i35uf
d33z1t0,"he wasn't made with one, so theres that.",4i35uf
d2w399o,"Yeah, I believe they get married in canon. Wiccan is their kid.",4i35uf
d2wluem,Yeah! I wasn't sure if I was just seeing that because of the comics or if that was legitimately being hinted at.,4i35uf
d2wo0v8,Does Vision have a dick?,4i35uf
d3bjnbb,"Theoretically, yes.  But we don't know yet if they'd survive it.",4i35uf
d2wsbjw,"I guess technically he's nude, including the cape, since he just made the cape appear from himself. We might be able to assume he did the same thing with his clothes. Maybe he's technically always naked.",4i35uf
d2wl4mf,More of a skin tight suit that is like a second layer of skin.,4i35uf
d2wsbuh,"I think that, like his cape, they're just part of him.",4i35uf
d2vw1ud,He wasn't trying to.,4i35uf
d2ws2zg,"Yeah, and that line didn't break his character . He didn't say ""He killed my parents."" Still cold with his dad. Consistent.",4i35uf
d2x1nzu,"Since the beginning he has struggled with guilt from his creations and actions hurting people. He realizes that they are real people, whether it is the guy volunteering in Sovokia in this film or people in the Middle East, like in the original Iron Man. 

Edit: I don't know how to spell :( ",4i35uf
d2xgxny,"I stopped being ""#TeamCap"" at the point, but I wasn't team iron man either. Heartbreaking stuff man",4i35uf
d2xvc0v,Didn't help seeing this on mother's day,4i35uf
d2xa8ps,Kinda reminded me of Magneto in X-Men: First Class.,4i35uf
d30r9u7,"His MCU iteration is now on my ""i don't give a shit about you"" list. He's the direct cause of, like 80% of the shit problems the Avengers have faced so far. He's also the least trustworthy, honorable, or even realistic. This whole series seems like some sort of shitty fever dream Tony Stark is having. And yet, somehow, the directors keep making him the guy that people listen to. It's absurd",4i35uf
d2xfzfq,He's a civilian in loafers,4i35uf
d2w3arz,"Cap wasn't made for war, no one is. Cap is just trained for War and knows how to accept it and deal with it.",4i35uf
d2ut8t0,"All talk of the movie aside, I'm really sorry, man.",4i35uf
d2x7tqk,Tony being powerless is like the main plot point of Iron Man 3,4i35uf
d2v3no4,And then Tony puts on the googles 😂,4i35uf
d2w4d1s,I thought that was touching after how emotional you see her just before that. ,4i35uf
d2xhwjn,"In her eyes, this random dude just said she was great after she was fretting about what regular people would think of her.  ",4i35uf
d2w3f5v,"Those words were probably rather uplifting for her after her mental struggle, and coming from a guy who was so energetic to just meet all the guys.",4i35uf
d2x0dwk,BTW Elizabeth Olsen is distractingly beautiful,4i35uf
d2vzley,"As a person who didn't know much about comic book characters, I can relate to Ant Man, since this is how I was when I first watched the first avergers. arrow guy, shield guy, ironman, sexy spy, hammer guy, and Hulk.",4i35uf
d2utrom,"I was hoping for ""Hawk Guy"" if only to preserve something from Fraction's run.",4i35uf
d2wwrds,"I wish he called him ""Hawk guy"" :)",4i35uf
d2yiug5,Haha so many good quotes in this movie. ,4i35uf
d334rbo,One of the best lines in the movie imo,4i35uf
d3h9pg2,"I felt like that was a nice nod to Daredevil and Jessica Jones, since in those they call the Hull ""the big green guy,"" etc.",4i35uf
hoyfsxv,"Now, Hawkeye is the arrow guy for everyone.",4i35uf
d2uqeoz,"Starlord, man. Legendary outlaw",4i35uf
d2v0p2b,Andy Dwyer and Bobby Newport.,4i35uf
d2urjca,Now I really want Ant Man and Starlord to meet up. ,4i35uf
d2ur7u3,Star Lord. Legendary Outlaw! Forget it...,4i35uf
d2ure0s,"Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw?",4i35uf
d2uqi5p,"Well, Star Lord, man! Legendary outlaw? ",4i35uf
d2vdsu6,I'd give you gold of I had any,4i35uf
d2vqs42,"I somehow totally forgot about Winter Soldier happening, and was expecting some kind of revelation about Romanov and WS working together before she left the KGB.",4i35uf
d38poo4,When did that black widow moment happen?,4i35uf
d2wfp47,"This was the funniest line in the movie for me. My wife didn't even crack a smile. I think this is a ""you love it or it makes no sense"" joke.",4i35uf
d2vqi5k,"I didn't get that joke, what was the deal?",4i35uf
d2wbqzp,"Jesus, the snarky commentary between those might just kill me.",4i35uf
d2wehfy,Doesn't Rocket tease Tony about his shitty out dated tech in the comics? ,4i35uf
d335epz,"Heh. ""Larger then life.""",4i35uf
d2v07db,Sweetums temporarily used ben and chris to find a charity but Paul Rudd wasn't in that episode. I don't know if they had any scenes together in other episodes. Maybe the elections...,4i35uf
d2vvwnk,"It wasn't. When the guy says it to Star-Lord, he doesn't mean it as an insult as opposed to when Tony says it.",4i35uf
d2unw0d,"That's probably my favorite part, things aren't back to status quo. It really feels like things got shook up. I'm excited to see how the consequences of these fights and actions play into the Thanos story. ",4i35uf
d2x5d4h,"Yeah, when they introduced the ""super soldiers"" I just assumed the climax would be everyone fighting together against a bunch of generic badasses. Killing them off and just having Iron Man and Cap fight was soooo much better.",4i35uf
d2xddiz,"I loved that too, I was kind of rolling my eyes at the inevitable team-up against the winter soldiers ending and then I was completely surprised.  Zemo was a great villain",4i35uf
d2xer21,"Except at the end, Tony Stark gets a letter from Cap and then ignores the government's call for help. So they kinda implied a soft reset anyway. Which is annoying.",4i35uf
d2w4z3u,"But why? Why did he even wanted the coordinates? How did he know only tony was going to show up instead of the whole team? 
",4i35uf
d2zogil,"then they shot that shit down the toilet by saying at the very end ""of course they will become friends again for the next movie.""",4i35uf
d2v8edu,"I like that he was a villain that they didn't need to fight. Any big baddie that can go toe-to-toe with the avengers we know will end with them challenging and eventually beating. 

Zemo brought out the Civil War in the Sokovia Accords to tear them apart, and also created a civil war inside each of them, making them second guess themselves and fight. He brings out the true conflict of the main characters, where Black Panther, Tony, Cap, and Bucky all have to think ""is what I'm doing right,"" and we see the payoff with Tony going against Ross/Bucky freezing himself/ Black Panther letting go his revenge/Cap going off the grid and rebelling against the government that he pledged himself to in the first movie. 

When I think about that, then yeah I think Zemo was a good villain. ",4i35uf
d2vo7rh,"He was a subtle villain, which is a little different for Marvel movies. This is also HIS origin story. He's not ""Baron Helmut Zemo"" yet. 

That being said, I'm hoping his sticking around leads to the Masters of Evil/Thunderbolts in Phase 4. That would kick ass. 

EDIT: I'd mention I'd avoided spoilers going into this, so when Zemo was going to the Siberia base for the super soldiers, I was thinking we were getting introduced to the Masters of Evil. I am pleasantly surprised by the outcome. ",4i35uf
d2x0iy0,"I also felt quite sympathetic to Zemo for two reasons:

1) his repeated, sad listening to the voicemail of his dead wife
2) his warm relationship with the room service woman at the hotel who would bring him breakfast ... he spoke to her almost like he'd speak to a wife (""you know me so well"")

Zemo seemed lonely!",4i35uf
d2w54xn,helps a lot that Bruhl has fantastic screen presence and intimidation. ,4i35uf
d2x9eki,Well Bucky was able to remember Cap's mother's name and they stopped fighting after that. It had some things in coMmon.,4i35uf
d34x584,I spend more time taking dumps in the morning than they spent developing his character.,4i35uf
d2vc6v1,"And it builds to a great character resolution: Tony willingly giving the shield back to Cap, forgiving Cap and signaling the return of their friendship and trust. ",4i35uf
d2v802k,"Yeah, but I wasn't too bothered because the way the trailer played out it looked like the fight happened right after Tony opened the door. We learned in the movie that that wasn't the case, and we saw the true motivation for the fight which at least for me was a good way to subvert the trailer. ",4i35uf
d2vkhm6,"I really agree. I thought they kind of telegraphed the fact that Bucky would be revealed as Tony's parents' killer through the whole movie, but the subtlety of that reveal was completely gone because you knew there had to be a reason for them to be fighting on that set they showed in the trailer. It just confirmed what had been strongly hinted at since the opening scene. 

That's not really a criticism of the movie at all. I absolutely loved every second of it, just saying the impact of that reveal would have hit harder if everyone who saw the trailer didn't already know they would be brawling again. ",4i35uf
d2wzwc7,"Yea, I didn't like that about the trailer. When Tony meets up with Buck and Cap, he jokes with Bucky to put the gun down as they've reached a truce, but I knew that obviously wasn't going to last because they had yet to show the double team fight scene from the trailer. ",4i35uf
d2xdulb,"The trailer wasn't too bad. Once Bucky put his weapon down and they started working together, I thought that Cap and Bucky were going to be mind controlled to kill Iron boy",4i35uf
d2vkhlu,"Crossbones was pretty evil, but he got crossed off pretty early on so I guess it is less significant.",4i35uf
d2wsoek,You're right but not sure why you're throwing pot shots at BvS,4i35uf
d2w5m3p,[deleted],4i35uf
d2v7x7s,"If Zack Snyder directed this the super soldiers would have been below New York and erupted from the ground in a building-shattering explosion, and the Avengers would put aside their differences to destroy the rest of the city in a tension-less fight. ",4i35uf
d2vr8ax,"One would be empty because it was for Bucky.  There were six pods in total.  When zemo arrives, five are lit up with bodies in them.  When capt arrives, they show they've been shot in the head.",4i35uf
d2v2ro3,"I agree, I think they're leaving one in reserve for another movie. They said seven others and very clearly showed only six pods lit up in both shots of that room.",4i35uf
d2v8f7k,"Oh, good eye! I didn't notice that, but I'm definitely going to look at my next viewing!",4i35uf
d2w3uqg,The last one was bucky back when he got brainwashed ,4i35uf
d2w55we,It was also cell block D23 :D,4i35uf
d2vn6br,"To me, that was huge. That was the best way to end Black Panther's story in the movie: he has been motivated by revenge for his father's murder, and when he finally has the person responsible in his grasp, instead of trying to kill him he actually stops him from dying, learning to let go. ",4i35uf
d2wtf14,"Yes, from what I believe the serum was the Cap formula that made Bucky the soldier he is. I believe there were enough to create the soldiers that they had shown. 

And he killed them because the thought of another super soldier disgusted him. He blames his family's death on the super soldiers that were populating the world so the ability to destiny a few while enacting his plan was too good. Of course, that's just my opinion. ",4i35uf
d2vm3lk,"Well, he called the room service attendant to bring his breakfast so she could discover the body and evidence that he left, which since it was directly related to the case that Tony was working with the government on Friday transmitted to him. I think the reason that he did this was to restore some trust between Tony and Cap, since Tony would want to apologize to Cap for it. Tony wouldn't go in blazing, he would find Cap and Bucky and help them. 

Bucky obviously knew because of his memories, so those two arriving would be a sure thing. I believe the catch was that Zemo planned on Tony feeling remorse and wanting to help Cap and Bucky catch him. Could be far fetched, it's just how I interpreted it. ",4i35uf
d2z5d9f,"They did try to talk, the problems were just too deep-seated to be solved by conversation. ",4i35uf
d2wspyr,Not really ,4i35uf
d2ut3ul,"Agreed, it was super impressive. I gasp when I first saw it because it was like they literally got a time machine and brought 80s/90s RDJ back (like they did with Michael Douglas).",4i35uf
d2usfkw,Basically the same effect from The First Avenger? Looked pretty damn good.,4i35uf
d2uwlje,"It looked a little fake when he got really close to the camera and paused. That entered uncanny valley. But before that, I agree, it was extremely impressive. ",4i35uf
d2uuiap,"I thought it was good when it was far away, but it started to break down when he got closer to the camera. I'm glad they had an in-universe explanation of why it wasn't perfect.",4i35uf
d2vwxiq,I thought it was funny because the CGI Rock in the Central Intelligence trailer looked horrible.,4i35uf
d2v7bu4,We were looking at two totally different scenes because that shit made so me uncomfortable.,4i35uf
d2vpt4j,"Whenever they do that people look very smooth. Even Nathan Drake in Uncharted 4 looks more realistic, the add texture to the skin and imperfections. Young RDJ looked a little too smooth and reflective. It's really hard to make it look natural. They did a decent job, though. ",4i35uf
d2w49os,You would've had plenty to see in the airport vehicles during the fight scene.,4i35uf
d2w4v7v,[Considering that Disney has the technology to basically make infinite facial expressions from three short clips](https://youtu.be/o-nJpaCXL0k)... the excellent CGI makes sense.,4i35uf
d2w6hvd,"I was trying g to figure out who that was,  until near the end of the scene I figured it was a young Tony.  But if his parents were super rich why we're they driving themselves? ",4i35uf
d2wwurp,"Nah, it definitely looks surreal and uncanny valley especially when they did a close up of his face near the end. STILL, very impressive and probably the best thus far, but don't act like it was flawless.",4i35uf
d2wxdbd,"the great thing about that scene was that even if you could find cgi artifacts, you could contribute them to the fact that it was... a cgi hologram in the movie, heh",4i35uf
d2uxj86,"Same thing here ! Have no idea how they made it , but makes the Paul Walker scenes from Fast 7 look amateur.
",4i35uf
d2utrcg,I feel like maybe eventually that's how Bucky comes back.,4i35uf
d2wr3jc,"Most movies would use new technology at the start of a movie as a Chekov's gun to be fired later as a literal object. Instead, Civil War used it to show how personal relationships which drive the dynamics further in the story. That is god damn great storytelling.",4i35uf
d2uofcc,"It was kind of jarring because they didn't announce that it was a flash back. Also RDJ had his normal voice.

But I thought the effects were great!",4i35uf
d2uplbi,"I mean, it was a holographic projection of Stark's memories. It wouldn't be surprising that it wasn't the greatest in CG.",4i35uf
d2ur9rw,"I thought the same thing, but when it turns out to be a hologram, I let it go.  ",4i35uf
d2v4nqm,After the preview for the movie with kevin hart and the absolutely terrible cgi young dwayne johnson it looked amazing in comparison lol,4i35uf
d2upk3b,It was def the stare,4i35uf
d2ux24e,"They covered for it well, it's not a real flashback, it's a holographic recreation taken from Stark's memory.

If anything doesn't look perfect they have an excuse. ",4i35uf
d2ux9rs,Yeah I got the uncanny valley feel from it too at times. ,4i35uf
d2v39q4,He looked like an alien. It was a weird scene.,4i35uf
d2vc5xp,"Absolutely, the uncanny feeling really kicked in at the last part of the scene where young Tony is staring sadly at the camera.

Now, could that have been on purpose? Seeing how it was a digital projection created by Tony? ",4i35uf
d2vrw6y,"To be fair, it was a re-created memory in the movie.  Being in the uncanny valley is reasonable for the story.",4i35uf
d2vxww2,"I assumed any spotty-ness would be explained by Tony's projection not being perfect. IIRC, young Tony's face looked more like CHI after the real Tony walked on stage. ",4i35uf
d2vz8ny,Yeah RDJ's face was kind of shiny and plastic looking.,4i35uf
d2w39or,"But, even in the movie it is a form of CGI right? Because it's that crazy tech that 3-D renders his memories. So I could easily forgive any uncanny valley-ness because it was all supposed to be CGI of a sort.",4i35uf
d2w552m,I think it was almost purposeful. The whole scene existed in virtual reality/holograms.,4i35uf
d2w5se4,">  I got a very strong uncanny valley feel. 

same here i was so confused, it almost looked like the movie with the rock and kevin hart",4i35uf
d2wqrn9,"It looked very real until towards the end of the scene, which maybe was on purpose.",4i35uf

Was a neat way to basically include them in the film to develop them more but also remove them in a sense similar to Hulk and Thor, because at the end of the day those 4 are OP compared to the rest.

",4i35uf

He's Wanda's babysitter and her well being is obviously his #1 priority.  When he accidentally shoots Rhodes, he admits to being distracted.

At least that's how I took it.  Though, if that's the angle they were going for, it could have been explained a little better.

I hated this part. Absolutely hated it. I saw the movie back in June and this still bugs me. I mean, it's an incredibly famous movie from what was pretty much *the first* blockbuster movie series.

I get that the writers were commenting on how young he is, but the movie only came out 21 years before this incarnation of Peter Parker was born. I mean, people born in 1960 wouldn't go around asking people if they ""ever saw that really old movie, *The Wizard of Oz*?""

d2v2ugt,"I think Widow signed it because she's always the more pratical one. It's obvious that govrnments won't just let go even all Avengers dismiss the Accords. She'd prefer temporary compromise than being forced on direct conflicts. Because of her past, she has more flexible line of ethics than Cap and weighs trust in certain individuals and family much more than her own opinions. I think her relationship with Cap has been well established in CA2. She has sort of faith in Cap and won't mind handling shady tasks for his sake. Natasha could make a loyal friend if you are able to win her trust. So when Tony mocked her that really hurt.",4i35uf
d2v1007,"I think Natasha signed it in order to smooth ruffled feathers and later figure out how to wiggle out of it later. Versus not signing it, thereby making a big declaration and shutting herself out of the access and Intel she'd have on the inside. ",4i35uf

She actually had *multiple* impacts on the story, including helping convince Steve that he was making the right decision and helping out his squad multiple times.",4i35uf
d2vuw6n,And it'd basically have to be a Spider-Man movie not a Captain America ,4i35uf
d2vwxsl,It made sense too because he hasn't been doing the hero thing for very long. So they can still have some of that inexperience play into his solo movie. ,4i35uf

d2x098g,"Well the other big thing is that this universe isn't big on secret identities, so one kid revealing it (when that wasn't even part of the Sokovia Accords) wouldn't have really mattered much.

Real shame they won't even try one of the movies.",4i35uf
d2xp45s,"Captain America movies embrace and push American *ideals*, which, let's be honest, aren't bad really.  Justice?  Freedom?  Everyone can get behind those, and Cap does, sometimes with it putting him at odds with the government itself (or SHIELD at least).  Plus he has the luxury of being a fictional character that embodies those ideals perfectly.

Contrasted with like, American Sniper, which only demonstrate American *actions* and are in real situations that plenty of people, American and not, are rather not proud of.  Plenty of others are, but it's not as universal.

Captain America isn't a ""Fuck yeah! America"" movie because he represents what America wants to be, not what we actually are.",4i35uf

d2vf8bh,Best one-logy evah !!,4i35uf
d2vmzhu,"That's exactly right, and that's what DC / Warners is screwing up. These two characters in the books don't hesitate because they have the best moral compasses in their respective Universes. That's what makes Winter Soldier great. Henry Cavill is given a character who seems sure of nothing, and is full of doubt. When I measure his capacity to inspire, it's actually negative. You feel like you'd have to explain TO him the best course of action. Not so with Cap.",4i35uf

EDIT: Yes, in terms of ideological and moral you're right. Sorry about that.",4i35uf

d2yp5dp,"Spider-man movies for MCU haven't been released yet. It's not fair to judge sony's spider-man movies against the marvel universe.

What Zemo did in Civil War is the real tearing them apart. when he is giving the speech to black panther and show tony and steve trying to hurt each other, its so powerful.",4i35uf
d2wkenp,"Maybe this movie was made to make up what they missed in Age of Ultron.

AoU was still awesome though ",4i35uf
d2va3lg,"Or it could be that Age of Ultron just wasn't as much of a pivotal point in the story that Civil War turned out to be. I know we expect grand things from the Avengers films, but AoU had plenty of elements that advanced the story. It introduced characters, developed existing ones, gave us the IM armor we all needed to see, and brought in the trust issues and ideologies that set the table for the next phase of the story.

AoU as a stand alone fell short of the hype, but as a chapter in the big picture it served its purpose.",4i35uf
d2wnvxb,With the Russo brothers directing both parts of Infinity War we should get a hell of an Avengers movie.,4i35uf
d2xgfa1,It makes me very excited the Russo brothers are directing the next Avengers movie. ,4i35uf
d2utsy8,"Agreed, and based on what I've read about BvS (""Martha,"" really?) I think this was a better version of that as well.     

There wasn't some grand world-threatening menace, but the stakes still felt high - you actually care about what happens to these characters now, and how they react. People in my audience actually gasped when Rhodey hit the ground and Stark saw the footage from '91. ",4i35uf
d2v6ov9,"Cap 3  also nicely dodged the unnecessary villain(s) that show up in the 3rd act just for a fight scene.

It was a refreshing twist",4i35uf

d2urslr,"Not to diminish your point because I do agree with you, but sharktopus vs whalewolf was a better 'vs' movie than BvS. ",4i35uf
d2vg7p8,"After watching it, I realized what BvS seriously lacked was some good super hero action. I felt like BvS had minimal action scenes. I also didn't connect emotionally with BvS, but that's a different story. ",4i35uf
d2uundd,"But what was Tony's mom's name and what's cap's mom's name? 

If they're the same, that could make them like brothers or something.... 

Maybe if they just said their own mother's name in front of each other, all the fighting would stop and they'd be bros.",4i35uf
d2w3sp3,"And I could FEEL the emotion behind the punches they were throwing at each other. I was actually like ""holy shit"" under bated breath in the Iron Beat Down part near the end. I actually thought - for a brief time - that this was it, there could be no more avengers after this. ",4i35uf
d2wzgji,"I'm not sure I quite buy Tony shrugging of the ""It wasn't him"" but it is reasonable. Everything else was solid from everyone involved and I love that at multiple times they actually talked to each other which never really happened in BvS.",4i35uf
d2v7mi7,"I think it was more polished and better executed, but half the characters had no business being in this movie, and the only two characters I thought would actually hurt each other were T'Challa and Bucky. Hawkeye even gets called out for pulling his punches. 

The whole airport scene (which I loved, it was amazing) was more like larping than a Civil War. It also had no bearing on the plot. It existed solely for the sake of pairing the characters against each other.

In BvS, despite its flaws, I actually believed that Batman and Superman were very willing to cause each other harm.",4i35uf

d2w9r10,"This is what I walked away saying coming out of the cinema. Also ""Holy cow they did it again, what a great film!"". I can't believe they had quadruple the characters in this movie (compared to BvS), yet none of the reason for the fighting felt contrived or drummed up just because of the film's title. 

I think it also benefited from not showing the entire film's plot in the trailer, something BvS got extremely wrong. ",4i35uf
d2x69a0,BvS should just been called Dawn of Justice and they should have replaced the fucking Bats origin dream sequence with Zeus and Diana and having Bruce standing at his parents graves. These two changes would shift many opinions.,4i35uf

Trope reversed! Well done Christopher and Stephen!",4i35uf

Ultimately he ends up getting KO'd in the end because he's inexperienced and wasn't taking it seriously. Also it seems like he either hasn't developed his spider sense yet, or was just not paying attention to it. He's only had his powers for 6 months and he was casually holding his own with everyone there, who has been doing that kind of thing for many many years and has so much more training than he does. His raw power was the only reason he was in that league to begin with. After he hones his spider sense and starts taking fights like that seriously, he'll be one of the big guns.  ",4i35uf

The initial roster was Cap, Iron Man, Luke Cage, Sentry, Spider-Man and Spider-Woman. Wolverine joined shortly thereafter.

THAT ALL SAID

With only limited time to work with to share the stage with 200 other characters, if they kept him like the comics they would have ended up with him coming off as Red Skull Lite, so they took out the nazi aspect, kept the exceptional competence, and at the last moment they made him tragic and left a window open for future fun.

Perfect? No. Better than I ever expected? Gosh yes, yes yes yes. I was half afraid they were going to have him wear his Cobra-Commander mask and then pull it off to reveal he's the Red Skull come back, or Loki. Or have him be a clown like movie Strucker ended up being.

d2w5obi,"I'm really hoping that Spider-Man Homecoming features Cap and Iron Man having private scenes with Spidey. The potential for them as conflicting mentors is awesome. 

Peter idolizes Tony for his technological knowledge and his swag. However they have more in common then just science and funny quips. Tony also had to learn the responsibility the hard way and also lost his parents tragically. Tony enjoyed the whole super hero thing at first too. Look just how much fun he has having in those first 2 Iron Man movies and Peter is still at that doe eyed point. The ironic thing though is that Tony is basically what Peter would of aspired to be even if he didn't get bit by a radioactive spider. Except Tony was handed most things in life where Spidey really has an appreciation for the little man that stems from his strong upbringing from Uncle and Aunt May.

However Steve is more aligned with his character though; which is what gives it such a yin and yang dynamic. They are both two of the most genuinely good people out there, who both started off as small wimps who couldn't protect themselves,  and they have this natural empowerment imbedded in them that makes them always do the right thing. They're New Yorkers who came from nothing and never had an ego. 

So the Spidey they've created in the MCU is really the best of both men. An I think we're gonna see this Peter Parker evolve from a high school kid to a grown man with a family leading the Avengers one day.

If Iron Man dies in Infinity War you can bet your ass he leaves Stark Industries to Pete. He is gonna be like a son to Tony and like Bucky to Steve.",4i35uf

I didn't think Zemo was a weak villain per se (and Daniel Bruhl was great), but his presence weakened the story in my view. In the comics there is no third-party manipulator, no ""we're all being played"" realisation, it's entirely about the competing ideological agendas and it lives up to the name *Civil War*. Whereas the addition of Zemo allows it to shy away from the darker elements and moral culpability in the comic series and make the film more like *Captain America: Heated Disagreement*.

Basically, when Wanda says ""You're pulling your punches"", it felt like she was talking about the movie as a whole. Disney wanted to keep all its heroes as good guys and avert the nastier shades of morality explored in the comic storyline, and it's all the poorer for that in my view.

d2wt2z1,"I don't get how Cap can be in the right here. He wants to operate without any oversight at all and just do what he thinks is right. In the real world, in what situation would we be okay with a group of soldiers who act of their own accord and don't have any accountability? It's standard dictatorship vs democracy, one person cannot just do what they want when they have that much power without checks and balances.",4i35uf
d2x2eaz,"See, that's the thing with Captain America movies. Steve is just so damn good, he simply doesn't have moral dilemmas. He never catches himself doing the wrong thing as long as he has the information (minus a few lies >.>). I love the movies and the character, but they're definitely dependent on third-party characters for the emotional turmoil, and this movie was *full* of it. Tony, Bucky, T'Challa, Vision, Zeemo, etc. Pretty much everybody was dealing with some shit, except Steve. He had a brief issue of deciding what side to choose at the beginning, but that was only because his friends were on the other side of what he *knew* was right. After that point, he was firmly resolved in all issues for the rest of the film. ",4i35uf

""Oh dude! This is just like in Empire Strikes Back during the Battle of Hoth where they take down the AT-ATs!.....but wait....I can't just say that!...that's way too out there and nerdy! These are the Avengers! They've done way cooler things....and they might think saying something like that is lame. Oh but man, this is the perfect time to say it......All right...just play it cool...casual....pretend you don't know the movie well enough to know what things are called.....Yeah! Like you've only seen it once a long time ago and it isn't your favorite movie ever...""

d2uqw3h,"I dunno though, personally I thought that they included enough to say it was as good as we could have hoped for with how little they were given to work with. 

They were able to pull off a Peter-esque moment of clarity in Black Panther, they gave us the Agent 13 playing both sides in Widow, Tony and Steve's reasoning and personalities were nailed pretty perfectly. I dunno, it just felt like enough for me and I saw enough physically, thematically and emotionally good moments that were taken from the comic story. 

It's never gonna be a perfect adaptation, but they nailed the elements I wanted to see. ",4i35uf

His initial plan was to get the location of the HYDRA base, then whatever sort of intel was on December 16, 1991, and then turn Tony against Cap with it.

When the HYDRA Colonel was all ""Hail Hydra, I ain't telling you shit,"" he took advantage of the Sokovia Accords.

""You needed someone to be there.""

In the comics Clint died or something so he got replaced by Kate Bishop, who for a long time was known as Hawkeye. Marvel, for once, decided to just forego the ""distaff"" counterpart and just make her Hawkeye instead of Lady Hawkeye, Hawkwoman, or whatever.

And then Clint came back. And then Clint became Hawkeye again. 

And now they're both Hawkeye.

Until one of the writers realized this was stupid, so he wrote a comic about Clint's downtime, which showed that people had difficulties remembering him. Some people thought he was Iron Fist. One guy in particular could never get his name right, and eventually settled on ""Hawkguy."" The name stuck and comic fans (and people who just like fun) embraced it. I'm not sure if we'll ever refer to Hawkeye as ""Lady Hawkguy"" though.

For the record, when I went with some friends one of my friends kept calling Falcon ""Hawk."" But I'm pretty sure that's just him. Don't know what he would have called ~~Lady Hawkguy~~ The Bourne Successor.",4i35uf

Actually Cap does address this saying ""what if they send us somewhere we don't belong, or what if we need to be somewhere and they don't send us"".

d30fsns,"Not my opinion, but Tony also makes the point that if the Avengers aren't acting on their own accord, there would be fewer challengers.

d2wzg64,"Which as I understood it was what Black Widow was proposing.  Tony may have had something similar in mind, given he had no problem dodging Ross later.  Team Romanoff ftw!",4i35uf
d2urcua,">No, because he's not doing it out of selflessness, but because he feels guilty.

But he feels guilty due to the actions of the entire team. Cap doesn't share this guilt from the beginning, deciding that he can't ever second guess his own decisions. He tells Scarlet Witch  as much. 

>It was Vision's fault for being distracted, you can't blame Wilson for dodging an attack.

Sure, but you also can't blame Stark for it. Which everyone in the prison  does. It's not like the Raft was anything he ever contemplated either. In fact he continually tells the group that the reason he wants them to sign is because this way they have some control, rather than no control. 

>He only kept the fact that Hydra killed them a secret, he didn't know it was Bucky.

Okay but how did he even know that much? 

>Rogers absolutely has the moral high ground. After Winter Soldier he's lost trust in taking orders from government bodies (he also correctly predicts that superheroes who don't abide will be interned in secret facilities). Tony lets his own personal guilt drive him into forcing Rogers into an ultimatum (government oversight or protecting a friend).

I think we just fundamentally disagree here. Cap does not want any oversight at all or to be held accountable for any damage he causes. Also, they both state there might be something worse coming if they don't step up and agree to it now. It's just Cap wants zero accountability for any damage he causes, choosing to focus on the good he does, while Stark is finally willing to be held accountable for his actions. 

>A few minutes earlier Stark calls Bucky ""Manchurian candidate"", so it's clear that he knows Bucky wasn't in control of his own actions.

People get emotional. And frankly, considering Bucky and Cap keep attacking him when he tries to stop them without force, it makes sense that he snaps. 

>Given the events of the previous films (Ultron and Winter soldier), and the personalities involved I think it  was about as neutral as it could be.

Again, I think we just disagree on this. ",4i35uf
d2us5ws,"I guess. My main problem with that is the implicit assumption that Cap is never wrong. Keep in mind this isn't just Tony's idea (though the movie hints at that with his encounter with the State Department HR lady), it's been in the works for a while. Tony is guilty and impulsive, but he's clearly thought about this beyond the death of one kid. Here, is Cap actually right? Should they never be held accountable for the damage they cause or the lives that are lost as a result of their actions? Cap got distracted, missed the bomb, and as a result, Wanda moved the bomb to a place where a civilian peace delegation was taking place. Was he in the right there? Just because Cap was right about the government being dicks this time doesn't mean he's also right about them operating without oversight. I know it's silly, but if this was reality, are you ever just going to assume these guys will always be right? 

And I really like the way the Russos tackle this. I guess my issue is that I'd like Cap to believe he's in the right when the truth is far more nuanced (he may actually be in the wrong). Actually, that sort of happens in this film. But u want the film to treat it like the facts don't really support him and it seems like the film takes his side. At the end of the day, he happens to be right, but does this actually excuse his lack of any real response for his collateral damage? Does that really mean his approach, one with no checks on his team's authority, is the right one? 

I think the fact that I'm this conflicted coming out of it is a great testament to the film itself. I just wish that Cap wasn't put forward as being ""right.""",4i35uf
d2vb4j4,">An airport had to be evacuated because Tony wanted to lock up an innocent man while letting the guilty one go free. Because Tony wanted to fight while Cap and Bucky were just trying to head to Siberia.

Actually, no one had told Tony Bucky was innocent. All he had was video footage. And he was also trying to bring Bucky in without getting him killed. He's trying to be peaceful about it while Rogers wants to run. 

>As for morality, just look at what Tony did. He put Wanda under house arrest. He locked his friends up in a supervillain prison without a trial. He attempted to kill an innocent man. He brought a 16 year old kid to a fight without giving him the full story and it put him in harm's way. And he did all this because he was feeling guilty about Sokovia. He's a hypocrite that wants to check everyone else's power but not his own. He's not trying to do the right thing, he's trying to feel less guilty.

For the first, yeah, as much for her own protection as for everyone else's. Lest we forget, despite her intentions, her actions caused the deaths of a lot of innocent people. The government would have done what they later did if he hadn't put her under house arrest at a pretty big and nice compound. Tony was staving that off. 

He also didn't lock them up. He had no desire for that to happen. We have no idea what story Cap told Hawkeye and Wanda isn't exactly old either. Tony tells Peter that they're trying to stop someone who thinks he's doing the right thing and won't accept he might be wrong. I'd actually call that a wash.

And what do you mean? The entire film except for the end, he only intervenes when given permission from the oversight body. He absolutely checks his own power. Cap spends the entire movie believing absolutely that he's in the right. He's got plot armor since he ends up actually being right, but that's not a great way to go about life. 

>He was trying to kill Bucky for selfish reasons. That 100% makes him the bad guy. At the same time T'Chala saves Zemo's life for completely unselfish reasons. It's quite the contrast.

T'Chala spent the entire movie trying to kill Bucky for selfish reasons. He turns selfless only at the end and even then, only to make sure Zemo is brought to trial to answer for his crimes and save another innocent. Through Cap and Bucky's actions, Rhodey nearly gets killed, an airport is destroyed, several German soldiers are seriously injured...the list continues. Their hands aren't clean either. And no, at the end of the film, Tony is not the bad guy. He's not some villain. He's just on the other side. 

>While under Hydra brainwashing/mind control...

Stark spent the entire film trying to bring Bucky with minimal collateral damage and without hurting him. That was his job. Cap spent the entire film keeping key facts from Stark that could've been given to him by a phone call. This includes the months where he didn't tell Tony Hydra killed his parents. He betrayed someone who had been trying to help him and who was his friend. Bucky killed Stark's mother and never told him or apologized. How would you feel? ",4i35uf

Don't think I asked, but luckily the movie does look at what happens when an individual thinks they're doing the right thing and in the process would harm people. Won't spoil it for ya.

> How many people died because his best buddy needed to be put down (by his own admission at the end) and Cap couldn't do it?

Well, again, it sounds like you didn't see the movie. So, I won't spoil it for you.

Here's the thing, and this is again spelled out explicitly in the movie. No need for metaphors, analogies or similes - because those are what the Superheroes and Supervillains are. When you look at who should have that freedom to make that decision of what's right vs wrong, the individual or a group, then ultimately you want to go with the individual. The group (in the movie, the UN), by its very nature is distanced from the reality of what it's doing. The layers of bureaucracy between its decision making and the ramifications of those decisions make it possible for egregious consequences - as egregious as when an individual makes the call incorrectly. There's a big, stinky difference. With the individual, you can have accountability. With the group, they've given themselves immunity. They've defused the responsibility through layers of process, and as such can't be held responsible for their decisions. Their stacks of regulations, rules, bylaws shield them from the result of their actions, because all of it was done ""by the book"". This is how some of the worst of the worst justify their actions to themselves, and to others.

Yes, individuals make mistakes, or their actions can have severe repercussions. The answer is *not* to add layers of ""oversight"" or bureaucracy, because the decisions made by those groups are just as likely to be incorrect, just as likely to harm innocents. We've fooled ourselves into believing that this isn't true. We've fooled ourselves into believing that we need these institutions, because well, without them, bad things would happen. And yes - sometimes, the institutions are able to get things right. But it doesn't mean that that's the *only* solution, the only alternative, to dealing with our problems. The alternative presented in the movie is to put that decision process back to the individual. What that means for us, in the real world, is outside the scope of the movie or this conversation.

Sure Iron man has guns and tech, but his armor can be damaged, where Cap's shield is nearly indestructible.

Same goes for Bucky's arm. Sure War Machine has the fire power but the Winter Soldier as an expert assassin. He would've found a way to get the upper hand to take him out.

Ant-Man is unpredictable and resourceful and was able to take on Scarlet Witch who is an agile hand-to-hand combatant.

Scarlet Witch had the upper hand over Vision and she would've again. We see how powerful Vision is which shows how much stronger she is over him. He's powered by the mind stone and Scarlet Witch is the manipulator of minds.

Anyway, Steve comes back to life and resumes being CA. Bucky goes off to do other cool things in Space. Then Steve loses the super soldier serum in a fight with Iron Nail and turns into an old man and so Sam Wilson becomes the new CA. Then we get to what has just recently happened which is the Pleasant Hill scenario with Kobik, a cosmic cube turned living entity, who gives Rogers his powers back.

d2wbpmc,"Agree to disagree on TWS. It just didn't do anything for me. 

But -- fun fact: After scoring both Thor 2 and Iron Man 3, Brian Tyler was brought on to do Ultron and was dropped. What you hear in the movie is a mix of his original score, additional music from Danny Elfman, and bits of Silvestri's score from Avengers 1. Apparently the powers that be, wanted more of a music connection to Avengers 1 and Tyler wouldn't play ball. Then they brought in Elfman who took Silvestri's original Avengers fanfare and moved it in a new direction. 

With that said, I love that Beck is coming back for Ant-Man and The Wasp as his score is easily my favorite out of all of the entries in the MCU. ",4i35uf

- Establish Batman

- Hint at the Justice League

- Have Batman and Superman fight

- Have it be Lex Luthor's fault

That's all. That's all that BvS had to chew with.

Here's Civil War:

- Establish Black Panther (and Martin Freeman's character, which could be a bullet point of its own)

- Establish Spider-Man

- Deal with Scarlett Witch's trauma or w/e

- Set up the fight between all the Avengers

- Have it be Zemo's fault

- But also have it be a fight justified by the characters own ideologies, one that would have happened even if Zemo wasn't there.

- Deal with Bucky's plotline after The Winter Soldier

Nobody's motivations made sense, no not even Batman's. It was also dreary and humorless and poorly-written, directed, edited, the whole gang. I hated that movie. And I swear, I went in so ready to give it a chance. But no.

I only bother to rant about this all over again because I just came back from Civil War and thought it was pretty excellent. Had some clunky things here and there, particularly in some of the set-up in the first act, but overall the contrivances worked beautifully in the exact ways that BvS's did not. Civil War cobbled together a dozen different characters arcs and kept their motivations mostly-coherent, while BvS couldn't even manage three at once without turning out a nonsensical, unbalanced mess.",4i35uf

Secondly, I know that the Avengers aren't fighting to kill, and perhaps the truck would be OP... but Ant-Man could've done more with those discs. 

Third, it is mission critical that Cap and the WS don't make it to that Quin-Jet. And Tony, who is sick of being lectured on collateral damage, decides to blow up half the airport to block an entrance (which still doesn't work). Let's also not forget, if the Quin-Jet is destroyed, they're in an *evacuated airport*. Free planes. Also, Iron Man, Rhodes, and Vision can fly (and have direct access to the government and could probably get a ride anytime they want).

I understand Cap's argument, and maybe if he was just on his own it would be different, but now with such a large cast of superheroes, the fights are getting far bigger and more dangerous. A group of vigilantes should not have the right to make life and death decisions. 

With Shield there was a sort of order, but now that Shield is gone, The Avengers are a loose cannon. Maybe a compromise would work best. Give The Avengers some autonomy, but have them report in every now and then to keep them in check. Both arguments have their strength. ",4i35uf

In the comic, it was far different, Iron man was way more pro-active (whereas the movie ironman is sign this to get it over with attitude).

d2uwkzb,I think just to start all this conflict between the avengers and tear them apart,4i35uf
d2ux1mx,"Zemos plan was, yes, to have the Avengers tear themselves apart.

He is of course patient and intelligent and after Sokovia decrypted many of Hydras files that were released. He found out who and what Bucky was to Cap and Hydra and matched up the date of a mission report in one of the files that occurred the same day of Tonys parents death. As well as the information on other Winter Soldiers. There probably was something about there being actual footage hidden somewhere, very likely where Bucky was kept but we kinda have to assume that. Then the Accords come into play, and with the team split on it, now is the perfect time to set this into motion.

He got the book with Buckys code and framed him for the bombing as well as proved he was still dangerous by activating him and having him attack and escape. Once Cap found him and told him the details of what he wanted to know, he knew Cap would believe him and they'd go. That's why when he found out Cap and Bucky were on their way, he then called the hotel so that they'd find the body of the actual therapist he empersonated. Tony would realise the truth, find out, somehow find out where they were going and meet them there to help.

Then the footage. Tony was now in the same room as the man that killed his parents. He watched him beat his father to death and choke his mother. And Cap has known for a while. Now, if you can't see why Tony would want to kill Bucky then...I have no hope for you. And if you've actually watched the movie and the other Cap movies then you'd know that there is 100% no chance that Steve would allow Tony to kill Bucky. And that's why they fight. Cap is trying to stop Tony from killing the friend he was actually ready to be killed by because he couldn't bring himself to kill him. Tony is fueled by grief, rage and vengence and feels betrayed by one of his closest friends. Neither will back down and regardless if any of them die, the two leaders of the Avengers are torn apart and will never be the same again. Wtih his plan successful and completed he deletes the voicemail, his last connection to his family and attempts to kill himself.

WE know that Infinity War is coming and they'll likely repair their relationship then, but for Zemo, this is the end of the team that took his family from him. He never said he wanted any of them actually dead. Sure it would be great if it happened. But he got what he wanted. At the end of the movie, HE WINS.

Yes, Zemo made assumptions and took a gamble here and there. But they aren't crazy leaps in logic and there's several points in the movie that his plan could still continue if one aspect of his plan failed. For example, when he gets the red book he tortues the guy to get the location of the Hydra base with the other Winter Soldiers, but the guy doesn't talk and Zemo says he'll have to do things he didn't want to do, leading to the UN bombing and killing of innocents. His plan is simple and yet seems to easily adapt to events going on with the Avengers themselves.

People will complain that Zemo is another wasted villain, no depth and his plan doesn't make sense. But honestly he's the opposite.

EDIT I don't mean that to sound condescending so sorry about that. I copied and pasted it from somewhere else were someone was claiming it made no sense",4i35uf

Even if the only thing he managed to do was frame Bucky, it still caused a hell of a lot of chaos in and of itself and put a real wedge between Tony and Steve.  From his perspective the worst case scenario there is probably Bucky quietly turning himself in and somehow exonerating himself, and that still would have resulted in a Bucky that was imprisoned in a discoverable location that he could try to do something with.

I mean, aside from something like some random cop on the scene shooting him, but his backstory is as some badass specops team leader of some sort so he's obviously comfortable with that.",4i35uf

Cap, along with everyone else, just had them plopped on their laps with minimal time to even think it over, and I think that didn't sit well with Cap. Especially since they weren't being given a choice, just the illusion of choice.

d2vr614,"Vision is well established even in the Marvel comics as a character that constantly holds back (even when he shouldn't). So that at least partially holds true to the movie.

Add that to his confusion over his relationship with Wanda and you have enough ingredients to explain his unwillingness to cut loose.",4i35uf
d2vs9px,"You missed the dialogue, apparently. 

The Vision was distracted by Wanda (he's falling in love with her) and he was aiming for Falcon's jets to ""turn him into a glider""-- Basically, Falcon would still have wings even with a dead jet and could glide back down to the ground safely, but because he was distracted he didn't aim perfectly, Falcon saw it coming and dodged, and it hit War Machine in the worst possible place- The Arc Reactor. 
",4i35uf
d2vt347,"> Yeah, action that made zero sense. Why didn't Vision do anything during the airport scene? He could have disarmed just about everyone lol.

Tony says to Black Widow it was time to stop taking it easy on them and then Vision jumps in, in my head Vision was hanging back unless needed. but we never were told that on screen",4i35uf
d2w50hr,"I find that super hero action is usually pretty contrived. A lot of abilities are vague enough such that they can be used creatively, but inconsistently. Ant Man is dense or light depending on what he needs to do. Thor's hammer lifts for whenever it is convenient for the plot (you bet your ass Cap will lift that hammer if Thor goes down in IW). It's both why Batman always wins with prep, and why he didn't load his gattling guns with Kryptonite bullets. I think the Russo Brothers do a pretty great job, but it gets harder as the scales get bigger and the limits on these characters abilities becomes less defined. The fights between Cap and Iron Man, or the fights against Bucky were 'better' for that reason. I also think that only a few Marvel movies have action that 'makes sense'. The Winter Soldier does for two acts, Iron Man is pretty great about it, but most of the movies are pretty lose about it. So, why didn't Vision do more in the airport? Because the Russo brothers didn't want him to. 

I think the thing with Rodey was it took out his power core, so he fell like a rock. If he hit Falcon's wing, he would have dropped more slowly, but someone would have turned around to catch him. If he got him in the body? I mean, Iron Man blasts Falcon in the face when he lands and he's fine. I know they're not the same power, but if it hit Falcon, I think the injuries would have been minor. So yeah, it would've probably tickled him! ",4i35uf

And his entire plan hinges on this knowledge (and finding it: remember, he didn't have it throughout most of the movie, he just SOMEHOW knew it existed and was looking for it) included the trigger words for Bucky.
How the fuck does he know ANY of this?

Zemo: 'When SHIELD fell, Black Widow release HYDRA files on the net. Millions of pages, much of it encrypted not easy to decipher. But I have experience and patience. A man can do anything if he has those.""

",4i35uf
d2wawkd,"Good thought!  Something Spidey didn't really have to worry about back in the 60's.  I am really looking forward to seeing more of Tony and Peter, loved how Peter constantly was trying to justify himself.",4i35uf
d2wbfs8,"That's what I'm saying to justify how he found out his real identity, but I really thought there was a line said by Tony explaining it. Thanks for your answer. ",4i35uf

d2x8fiq,That's v interesting cos I thought vision couldn't be wrong? Yet I agreed with cap so I was conflicted as vision is usually unbiased. ,4i35uf
d2x80dr,"I mean Vision's story and Wanda's story are both about their own fallibility.

Tony's seems to be about how his mental illness is pretty much consuming him at this point, and how he can no longer control himself.

Rhodes really didn't change. He's the consummate soldier.

Cap didn't change very much either. He's the paragon of liberty and justice as he has been since Captain America: The First Avenger. He and Peggy seemed to change the very least throughout their stories, both inflexible in what they think is right, and incapable of being dissuaded from acting according to it.

Witch and Hawkeye are unchanged. Buckey is himself again, but knows he's a danger and puts himself to sleep.

And ant man is still hilarious.",4i35uf
d2xjxed,I think it was a sex joke,4i35uf
d2xfih9,I think it was also that vision still didn't see Cap's avengers as the bad guys and didn't want to hurt his friends. Did you see what he did to War Machine w one blast? Vision could have easily killed all of cap's men (save scarlet witch) without even trying.,4i35uf

d2v6akd,"I'm not necessarily sure that Zemo's plan really required Cap and Tony both showing up at the bunker anyway. Or at least, the plan didn't *require* them both showing up.

d2xg6h8,"I think adjusting for degree of difficulty, I give it to Black Panther. It's hard to make his ""super serious vengeance time wait nvm"" arc seem genuine (and not just a plot necessity), but Chadwick Boseman nailed it, and also delivered three of the most badass lines in the entire movie. But no question Spider Man was the most fun.",4i35uf
d2uupjg,I meant with Zemo,4i35uf
d2uowmk,Agreed. I don't know if it got better over time or if I just got used to it. But in the introduction battle the action was just hard to watch. ,4i35uf
d2ut25x,"Giant-Man, made it seem like Spidey was at the end of the fight not there from the beginning, was Zemo even IN any of the trailers? I'm not saying they didn't show a lot, but in BvS there were literally NO surprises in that movie from what the trailers showed. BvS would have been a little better if we didn't know about Doomsday from the jump and knowing that Batman, Sulerman and Wonder Woman would be teaming up at the end.",4i35uf
d2ut49y,"I'm guessing he means Peggy and Giant-Man, which were way more surprising imo",4i35uf
d2v79hr,"Great, but not unexpected... It's much easier to find closure after a few days, while the wound is still fresh than it is after stewing about it for the past 25 years.

Black Panther has a very rational response, and understands the greater good of bringing Zemo in alive(also why he helps the winter soldier at the end of the movie,) Tony has a very irrational response, which Capt. understands and see, which is why he offers the Olive Branch at the end of the movie.",4i35uf
d2wh2q1,The aunt/niece?,4i35uf
d2wae57,Agreed. Besides that I think that fight was way too beautiful and well shot to just give away in trailers.,4i35uf
d2wads9,"Yeah, the trailer specifically framed it so that it looked like Cap and Bucky were the antagonists for the final fight. So while it wasn't a surprise that there was a fight going to happen (I actually presumed that Buck was gonna get reconverted by Zippo, and Cap was gonna have to stand by him because America), the fact that Stark pretty much turned shove into hit was unexpected.",4i35uf
d2wand0,"I agree, *but* I will say, when the video started playing on the screen at the end, I had a flash in my memory of the fight we hadn't seen yet, and gasped because I started piecing it together.

The reveal of ""IS THAT FUCKING WONDER WOMAN. OH. *MY*. GOD."" would have been spectacular. But noooo. You just had to shove it in the damn trailer. Oh looook at us, we've got wonder woman.

What a waste. As soon as you see her at the party ""Oh, it's wonder woman, how *ssshhhhhocking*"". The reveal build up in the movie, with the old picture; Shit, is that wonder woman? surely not? Ruined by the trailer. No surprise just, oh yeah of course it is, she was in the trailer.

Maybe I'm irrationally angry about that. But god damn.",4i35uf
d2wn05o,One of the aspects I thought they handled very well was this; none of them were actually good or bad. They both had good arguments and throughout the film I kept on switching sides because both of them *made so much sense*!,4i35uf

d2vkfke,She *did* want to leave the house. She showed discomfort with her house arrest the second Vision said she wasn't allowed to leave. The reason she didn't leave until Hawkguy shows up is because she didn't want to cause tension since she felt everyone hated/feared her.,4i35uf
d2vkiqh,"And the second time, it was more of a remorse thing I guess.",4i35uf
d2vm9gx,"She absolutely did want to leave, she was just really low so it was easy for Vision to talk her into staying. When Hawkeye came there he gave her the necessary push to go ""no more""",4i35uf

d2vs5k8,"It won't happen. For that to happen Fox has to either scrap their entire  X-Men history and story, or Marvel has to accept Fox's history as part of the MCU. It also undermines the Inhumans story, so it's REALLY unlikely it will happen. 

Just because the directors want to do Wolverine doesn't mean Marvel Studios would ever agree to Fox's intrusions. ",4i35uf
d2vtxoa,"I feel in order for an actual death to happen, it may yet take a bigger push. Especially for the actors to end their contract or have their contract run out. I do think perhaps the Disney umbrella might make it tough for the movie to be as dark as it could be. Though that being said, despite there being no deaths of heroes, this movie still felt incredibly dark.",4i35uf
d2vtzc0,"I'm gonna paraphrase an earlier comment I made and say that comic book deaths (and comic book movie deaths) mean nothing.  If Steve or Tony had died, one of them would have inevitably been brought back to life (Marvel isn't gonna kill off either of those cash cows for more than half a movie). At the end of it all, we'd be left with the same result we have now--a relationship between two characters that will never completely heal--plus a death that added absolutely nothing to that equation because it wasn't permanent.  Then people would have been bitching about that instead.",4i35uf
d2w0i0i,"True. But so far the MCU hasn't gone down the comic book rabbit hole where weird shit happens or justifies what's going on. At least not to me. They seem to stay away from it, so ""average"" audience members won't get lost. 

 I'm assuming Doctor Strange may change that though. ",4i35uf
d2w072c,Agreed. I wish they would at least have been captured and taken alive so they could pop up again in MCU if Marvel wanted them to. Not saying they should. But having the option open would be cool ,4i35uf
d2w3kiv,"Probably. For the short time that Crossbones was there though, I loved his anger toward Cap. I felt he could've been utilized in so many other ways.

I personally liked Zemo.",4i35uf

d2vef4l,Yes incredibly! Every character they've handled has been on the nose perfect.,4i35uf
d2ux1n8,"But like Cap said, Tony was able to make the choice to destroy his suits, just like he chose to create Ultron. The Tony Stark that these movies have created wouldn't just bend over for the UN because of some collateral damage. The Tony we know from the movies is smart enough to know that if he gives up his own decision-making ability to a bureaucracy, they will inevitably make even worse, more unethical choices on his behalf (like nuking NYC in Avengers) or be corrupted by a special interest group (like SHIELD was with Hydra).

But deciding they needed oversight, to the point of fighting/arresting his closest friends, just felt entirely forced and out of character.",4i35uf
d2uwtze,"Maybe I didn't explain my point very well - Let's say Stark finds out that Bucky killed his parents earlier in the film and totally loses it. He decides he's going to kill Bucky or die trying, and allies with Panther. Tony is totally out of control and crosses a line, driving a huge wedge between everyone. Cap decides he's going to protect Bucky at any cost. Then Vision/BW/Sam/etc are then left with the choice ""Do I stay out of it and watch Cap and Tony literally kill each other, or do I pick a side?""

I know that the ""we need oversight"" motivation was the basis of the Civil War in the comic, just saying this movie didn't really sell me on that actually being enough to start a real fight, which is way it felt like play-fighting until the last act (AFTER Tony finds out about his parents).",4i35uf

""What, just like that we're good?""",4i35uf
d2v4ua2,"Well to be fair, his primary objective was to keep Wanda under house arrest.

By cooking for her, he was trying to show her his *human* side, and that he doesn't fear her like everyone else does.",4i35uf
d2v66f9,"You do realize they were on a covert ops mission and Vision doesn't exactly ""blend in"" well, right? They were going for stealth, not fire power.",4i35uf
d2v7pl2,"Well, it was an undercover mission is a country they were not supposed to be in, so I can see why they wouldn't want to bring Anroid Man",4i35uf
d2v6qtc,"Because Tony has made the mistake of attempting to use the Mind Stone without understanding it before and that lead to Ultron. It makes sense that the team is cautious about using Vision unless they *need* to. Then, after Crossbones, he's the only one possibly strong enough to handle Scarlet so he's on babysitting duty.",4i35uf

Ultimately I agree with caps thinking that they shouldn't sign but he could have done things waaay differently. He justifies his actions throughout the movie because he wants to save his friend.

The rational conversations that SHOULD have occurred never did.

They did present this as a sort of slippery slope where it starts with this act and ends with everyone who doesn't comply with it buried in a submarine prison, but even that felt a bit forced.

In fact it's what happened in the comics, they reached the point where they could never be friends again, and it took Cap dying for Tony to realize how badly he messed up.

The fact that clark called out his mothers name instead of begging for his own life proved this to bruce and made him realize that he is the one that is out of control and wrong.

Batman was mad at superman for two reasons: it was the direct result of supermans inability to get Zod away from metropolis that led to the deaths of thousands of people including Jack. Bruce's anger and paranoia against Superman was worsened after bruce had the Knightmare, where he saw what could happen if superman lost control. It was this and manipulation by Lex that drove Bruce to declare Superman a threat.

Superman was angry at bruce/Batman because batman is the opposite of him; he is a murderous and violent vigilante who's branding of criminals is practically a death sentence for that person, and yet Batman is idolized by the citizens of Gotham and the police practically help him do what he wants. Superman hates the fact that he tries to be good and saves people and yet humanity hates him, while batman is the complete opposite and yet no one hates him they think he is what gotham needs.

Furthermore the only reason Superman fought batman was because he was told by luthor ""kill him or your mother dies"" he tried talking to batman into getting him to save Martha, when Batman didnt listen Clarks only option was to kill him.

Tony goes down to the lobby and joins in the fight to try to stop him from escaping armed with only the one gauntlet and the fancy glasses. They kinda slap around each other for a bit, Bucky has the pistol in his hand. It goes off in Tony's face, the glasses stop the bullet. Tony's face starts with, ""Oh shit, that gun just went off!"" then goes to ""Holy shit he just shot at me?!"" then to ""Motherfucker you just shot at me!!""",4i35uf

And if Zemo's plan was to kill the avengers and not just break them up why did he tell Ross or whoever ""Did it?""  When he asked how it felt for his plan to fail? Why did Zemo seem satisfied enough with how his plan went that he then was able to end it all with suicide? He didn't stick around to see even one avenger die.  He was like ""Alright,  they started fighting.  I'm done here."" ",4i35uf

d3750op,I actually do too. I was more than a little disappointed that there wasn't a death in Civil War. I feel like Disney Marvel is playing it a little too safe in that regard. Civil War needed somebody to die to give it just that little bit more gravity.,4i35uf
d2uuitu,"I can appreciate what you are saying but I cannot get past the vigilante aspect. I imagine a world with, say, Superman. That would be utterly terrifying. A god tier creature with the strength to do the impossible would not have a place in our reality because of the danger that accompanies them.  I, in the real world, would want them to be held accountable. What promise is there that their self interest lie with the rest of the worlds, or even, other countries? They have total disregard for a nations sovereignty and so they bounce around the world without even having to ask permission. They mean well, but the casualties would be much, much larger than the film suggested. In our world they would be indirectly/accidentally responsible for hundreds of deaths per mission. There is a major difference between a soldier following orders, I'll admit a lot can go wrong with obedient people, and a vigilante who has taken it upon themselves to solve problems their way. 

Still, great movie!!! I love the discussions that it's causing.",4i35uf
d2uupfq,"I thought it proved the opposite, they were able to handle the situation themselves safely while still having hope of a solution and avoiding government control. Rather than being unfairly jailed and prosecuted for being brain washed and not understood by those who would have prosecuted him with the backing of an ignorant and frightened society. 

Edit: just spittballin here but I think Vision sided with tony because he acknowledge the amygdala response as a natural reaction in Humans so from his high minded perspective he acknowledges it as a fact of humanlife they are subject to rather than expecting understanding and adjustment from these confused lower lifeforms. Captain meanwhile is human and is more demanding of fellow humans in their responsibility to understand conquer this response. Vision dismissing the humans ability to do this seems hypocritical to me based on how he described his own crystal and how if he understood it he could change. If you can why not humans?

d2vihjv,"EXACTLY!

During my first viewing of BvS, I found myself saying "" wait, how did we get here again?"" When Flash appeared I was like ""ok, wtf now"" it shouldn't take multiple viewings of the same film for me to follow or to ""get it""

I couldn't help but think about this during Civil War. I never take part in this DC v Marvel thing because it's juvenile and the studios want it, but I felt a tinge of jealously that the characters I'm personally vested in and love couldn't get the same treatment as CW.",4i35uf

So, there's this Spider-Guy, Boy, Kid, in New York. Tony leaves Berlin, goes to NY, meets this kid to give him a ""grant"" then shows up in Berlin again with a completely new Avengers member (who everyone knows is from NY, because YouTube), but don't worry, his secret identity is top priority.

d2v7xn4,"Yeah. Like, this movie was a mess. When you really break down the plot, half of it doesn't matter, and the rest is half baked.

But it was fun. The fights were cool. The dialogue was great. I would have liked for some of the dramatic moments to have not been punctuated by a joke, but it all worked well.

The BvS comparisons are unavoidable, but in my mind, the ONLY things this movie did significantly better than BvS was it was fast paced and packed with jokes, which I think brushes over a lot of sins.",4i35uf
d2v8qia,"Yeah, I saw that as more hand waiving than actual justification, though. Also, he would have had to make Spider-Man sign the accords, right? Would they allow him to use Spider-Man without knowing who he was, and if they knew his age, would they still be ok with it?

His whole involvement feels very pasted in. It works because every scene he's in is amazing and his character is awesome, but he had no business being there for any other reason than making an awesome fight scene/introducing the character.

d2v85uc,"It was only stupid because he eventually comes back to life in the comics. At least there, it can kind of make sense because they can shoehorn in some crazy mystic elements, alternate timelines, that kind of stuff, because the continuity is constantly being rebooted and it doesn't damage the franchises at all.

I feel that if resurrection is brought to the MCU, it's going to greatly diminish the quality of the films. Watching a movie has so much more of a time commitment and if they were to fuck around with the continuity and reboot this and that, they'd damage the product. Look at *Fantastic Four,* or *Spider-Man,* or *Batman VS. Superman,* they're all basically reboots and people flat out don't care about them (yeah, they're bad, but people are sick of reboots). I feel that if someone's going to die in the movies, they die forever.  War Machine couldn't die during the big airport fight, instead he got paralyzed and needs to go through rehabilitation--it gives the aftermath of the fight some stakes, it teaches each hero that they have to be more cautious when there's internal conflict. Quicksilver dying in *Avengers 2* is purposeful because it builds Scarlet Witch's character.

We're like a dozen movies into the MCU and they're all massively successful, they're not going to shoehorn in shitty plot devices.",4i35uf

d2wfs5b,"Likely wasn't some random wilderness road.  Seemed like it was a road leading out of the Stark compound.  Tony says ""I know that road"" when the video starts, so I'm guessing its one he grew up on or around.

As for why Cap doesn't just take Bucky in...did you watch the movie?  He tries to bring him, but ends up becoming a fugitive along with him when he tries to prevent everyone from trying to kill his friend.  Furthermore, they're shooting to kill due to the UN Bombing, a crime Bucky didn't commit.  So he's not in a rush to hand over his best friend to possibly get executed over a crime he didn't commit.  Especially when the guy who did blow up the UN is still at large, and as far as Cap knows, attempt to wake up a whole squad of super soldier assassins in a location only Bucky knows of.

One of Cap's worries about signing the Accords was that the Avengers could be needed somewhere and they wouldn't let them go.  So he brings in Bucky for a crime he didn't commit, meanwhile Zemo raises a squad of super soldiers that can destabilize a country in an evening without anyone knowing they have even been there, and thanks to the Accords, he can't put a team together to stop them without approval, which he probably wouldn't get.  It doesn't matter that Zemo's ultimate plan was something else entirely, if you look at Cap's motivations based on the information he had, it makes sense.",4i35uf

While this is mildly annoying, it is completely forgivable for the story.  Yeah, I thought the same thing... ""who the fuck is filming this?"" and then saw it was a camera and was like... really?  

But honestly it's not hard to believe a security camera might have caught the crime happen.  It's not like there weren't security cameras back then, and maybe it was at a private compound or airport entrance.   They were actually common enough in the early 90s to be believable.",4i35uf

That doesn't mean you have to forget though. 

I guess it was just that every single person acted the same way.  It was one singular reason, that's what bugged me.   Oh someone I cared about died while the good guys tried to save the day.    When a fire destroys homes and the fire fighters fail to prevent all the damage we don't blame them.   (maybe that's not the best example)

My argument is that if Steve knew this, and he wanted to be a good friend, he should've told Tony this beforehand. Instead, we get stuck with a plot line that feels undecidedly un-Steve like and was the only bitter note ringing around the back of my head. If it had been a little more believeable, i.e. ""Tony I didn't know"" (and he didn't know), then him fighting against Tony to defend his friend from an enraged tank makes more sense, but in return the symbolism of cap slamming his shield into the iron man suit's core and breaking tony's ""heart"", is lost because Steve's betrayal is what seems to have hurt the most of all.

That's a court marshalable offense, and he doesn't care because its the right thing to do.

Rogers is always a libertarian at heart. He always follows just orders, but ignores unjust ones. Tony is too, but be for whatever reason, partially because of Rhodes's influence (Rhodes is the real Authoritarian company man), partially because of what he thinks is politically expedient, he goes along with the accords.

I personally don't mind a homicidal Batman if the movies can set it up correctly. BvS just kinda throw Batman to viewers' faces and it wasn't well received. The sad fact is that Batfleck can actually play a decent Batman. Just give him a solo movie first lol",4i35uf
d2uydsg,"He says that he knew the Starks were assassinated but makes the point to say he didn't know it was Bucky.

I think the difference between Cap in Civil War and Batman in BvS is the characterizations. From the Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron we see that Cap doesn't trust organizations. We see this characterization continue on into Civil War. Cap never breaks any of his own rules, but that doesn't make his actions right and they do have consequence. I think part of the point is that he is fallible.

On the other hand we have Batman's characterization in BvS. For almost the entirety of his run in comics Batman has been know for only having one rule: he does not kill. This rule is reinforced in the Nolan films and is a big part of the core character. In BvS he breaks this rule a LOT. That's why his actions are seen as excessively violent compared to caps', they're uncharacteristic of him. ",4i35uf

And watching parents being brutally murdered is really different, especially when Zemo broke the news in such a manner, not to mention how betrayed he must have felt when he found Cap already known. That's why Zemo had to lure them into such an isolated place after already putting them through messes, not because he's a lunatic into staging dramas, but to make sure there's no time and space to cool down. I think Cap understood. Btw, I kind of think they do need a fight to reach real conciliation for future plot development.",4i35uf

d2vc9hg,"Really good point, I hadn't even thought about Daredevil or Punisher!! ",4i35uf
d2vem2r,"The Punisher's a bit of a loose cannon. If Tony's trying to sterilize the Avengers' image and get them under restraint, I don't think they want an escaped convict serial killer. Daredevil would be a more likely candidate, but he's a cool ninja, whereas Spider-Man can web-sling (great for non-lethal restraint) and stop a car going 50mph. From a purely physical standpoint, Spider-Man is more powerful than anyone in that fight except Vision. Daredevil couldn't measure up.",4i35uf
d2vbnr4,That's what I mean too. We won't see any of these people until Infinity War and no clue what they are doing now. Who is even on the current Avengers? Did Tony Stark sign? Did we actually see anyone sign them? If they did do they still believe in it? What are those Avengers gonna do when asked/told to do something they don't agree with?

d2w3zy8,"SHIELD made a pretty significant public showing when they were helping rescue civilians in AOU. You can't just hide something like that in this day and age. I imagine as soon as the helicarrier showed up everyone who knew SHIELD knew it was them. So were they underground before AOU? Sure. But After? It would be really hard to believe that no one knew of their existence.

But that isn't even necessary. All Fury would need would be a contact within the US Government or the UN and a phone call to the Avengers to brief them about the Sokovia Accords. I'd assume as the leader of a top notch group of spies, agents, and operatives that Fury would at least have the ability to do that.

Shield still exists. Fury appointed Coulson the new director. ",4i35uf
d2w3xv0,"Last I recall, SHIELD made a pretty significant comeback thanks to the events of AOU. I mean you can't hide something like a massive helicarrier and significant operations to rescue civilians and still pretend to be ""underground"".

Also it ends with cap writing to tony that they will be there when he needs them, so it's like the whole civil war never happened, it's just that now the team is two different countries and one half is fugitives. but Agents of shield has better stuff than this... ",4i35uf
d2wzbz5,"Agreed. I felt this movie had more impact and I was far more invested precisely because the stakes weren't End-Of-The-World like many of the others have been. We've invested in these characters and we know them so well at this point that to see them disagree and splinter is far more compelling than a macguffin-laden take over/destroy th world plot. Not only that, but if they follow up on Cap's promise in his letter to Stank (HA!): 'if you ever need us...'

d2uzfy5,"The stuff about Zemo's plan didn't bug me until after the movie. The logistics had me constantly going 'Huh?' througout.

But Zemo's plan is as follows as far as I can tell:

1. Ask the Hydra Officer about the location of the base and the mission report. This would have really been the easiest option, only instead of torturing him, he should have just laid out his plan, and he might have helped out willingly. Luckily for us this let's the rest of the movie happen.
2. Bucky is next on his list. Instead of possibly hundreds of other retired Hydra soldiers who worked at the base. But Zemo can't find Bucky on his own, so he goes to Austria bomb the summit and start the manhunt.
3. He correctly deduces that this will flush out Bucky, but he has no idea that he will show up in Europe. He could be in Asia, The US or South America. But luckily Bucky is in Europe. Otherwise it would have been hard for Zemo to transport the big EMP, that he has somehow built in his hotel room.
4. Since he knows that they will fail to kill Bucky, but succeed at apprehending him, he assumes that 1: He will be taken to CIA in Berlin 2: They will send for an outsider to question and analyze him. Zemo will apprehend this freelance psychologist, kill him, stash him in the bathtub of his hotel room and use the reveal to finally get Iron Man to go to the base as well, even though he has no knowledge of the situation inside The Avengers at this time.
5. Having assumed the identity of the analyst, he sends the EMP to a transformer station near Berlin to be delivered and set off at the exact time Bucky will be brought in for questioning by him. He also knows that there will be no guards or anyone else present in the room during this interview.
6. He travels to Siberia, kills the other five super soldiers and the rest of the plan goes off almost without a hitch.

It's pretty far-fetched, but he succeeds at nearly every level, except when Black Panther prevents him from killing himself at the end. For some reason, Zemo doesn't need to be 'analyzed' or evaluated, but is interrogated by Martin Freeman personally. ",4i35uf
d2xawma,"I'm not OP, but for me personally, I felt like I was disappointed by the fact that it *tried* to be a more thoughtful and mature film, but at the same time refusing to do so, was what underwhelmed me.

The action and comedy was, by far, the centerfold of this movie. Everything else was secondary. I felt like the movie really wanted to be this deeper and more mature thing, but never allowed itself to be. A great example is when Rhodey was knocked out of the sky and fell to the ground. A moment that should have been a huge emotional turning point for the audience was quickly interrupted by a comedic moment. It's like they were scared that having an emotional moment would scare away the audience, so almost immediately they have a comedic beat in which Tony blasts Falcon to the ground. Completely unnecessary, and completely interrupts a serious turning point moment in the movie.

At no moment does the movie feel like it's comfortable letting the audience sit with a serious or mature moment. If something serious happens, it is *immediately* contrasted with a comedic moment or line. The ending finally feels like it's getting on track with Tony and Rogers going toe to toe over Bucky, but even that is immediately reversed with Tony letting Rogers break everyone out of prison after receiving an apology letter.",4i35uf
d2xawy4,"See, and those are the parts I like most too, and even those didn't really hit a home run with me. I thought they've been much better done in many of the other movies. They didn't stay on anything long enough to let it sink in. Rhodes gets shot down, and next thing you know, he's awake going into the MRI machine. They tell you he's hurt, be the old adage in storytelling, show, don't tell. Visually, he's fine 30 seconds after he's shot down. Vision is, I guess, conflicted? You only get 1 shot of him in the background to tell. Cap's team is thrown in prison, but we don't see any of that, they're suddenly just there. They left out stuff that would've let the emotional stuff hit home. And then, the big line at the end ""he's my friends""""so was I"" was in all the trailers. ",4i35uf

All in all, it leads to the movie being pretty good, not great. If I was ranking them, I'd put it at 10th amongst the MCU movies. Was a little disappointment just because of the build up, and that it didn't quite live up to the standard set by the other films.",4i35uf

Already had scene Bucky and Cap tag teaming Stark. Had even already seen the ""he's my friend""; ""so was I"" line that was a pivotal point in the climax. We got Giant Man and War Machine being shot down (that was immediately softened by showing him alert, and at the end, with Stark prosthetics and his attitude, kinda implies not much is gonna change there). At the end of the film, everything stands pretty much the same as in the beginning of the second act, with the exception of Bucky being frozen and Panther switching sides. Nothing was resolved in the third act, and nothing evolved in the third act. It was just a setup for the next Avengers film, the first of which will probably have them operating separately, only to get whooped and decide at the end to join up against Thanos.",4i35uf

Long story short he is a great villain with a lot of motivation to end cap but at the same time he has so much more villain potential for multiple movies AND franchises, he could easily be in many films. And they completely wasted him in this film with a ridiculous plot that would never happen to Baron Zemo. He is no family man. That said I know its a film but a character like that you don't waste.

I will definitely watch the Infinity Wars, but I think with even lower expectations. This movie kinda proved that it is difficult to work a script with so many different leading characters.

Which is a really good allusion to how he caused Uncle Ben's death. At the same time, I realize that Cap has a similar opinion of the Sokovia Accords; by being regulated on when they can act, they are responsible for the lives lost when something happens and they fail to act.

Prior to Uncle Ben's death, Parker just uses his powers to win wrestling matches(Assuming they're going with the traditional backstory)m and would definitely not consider himself a crime fighter.

So the incident with the spider bite might have happened a year prior, then around 8 months prior Uncle Ben died, then 6 months prior Parker decided to become a crime fighter in Uncle Ben's honor.

I mean, the movie ends with Rogers telling Tony that he's still there if he ever needs him, and Tony allowing Rogers to break out the rest of the heroes on the Raft. That doesn't really seem like something two people who are still at odds with one another would do.",4i35uf
d2uxurm,"The story arc was shot down prematurely. I wanted to see blood, this is a civil war, where's the carnage? The entire movie was a beautiful build up. They balanced the characters better than they have ever before and told the story simply and as quickly as they could. Spiderman and Black Panther somehow both had excellent introductions as well? Amazing. It's clear Marvel is still the top dog when it comes to superhero movies, DC is 8 years late to the whole ""cinematic universe"" game and they aren't doing nearly as well.

And when we saw the tape that final time we knew. The second Tony said, ""I know that street,"" we felt his pain, his scene at MIT made sure of that. And then when Captain America said he knew? Oh my god I lost my mind. That was the moment. Their petty, sort of half-baked feud just become personal, and it was going down. That fight was beautiful. It had really become a civil war.

And then they shot it down. They're still pals in the end?? no worries?? Of course if the planet is under attack again (THANOS) then they'll unite, but right after all that build up and emotion (8 years of it I have to add, this started with the first Iron Man movie) they decide to throw it all away. More movies may dispel my worries, but what I saw in those last 10 minutes completely uprooted everything for me.

How I would have ended it: Captain America helps Bucky up and leans him against a wall while he retrieves his shield, still in Tony's chest. Before he can grab it Tony gives his line, ""my father...you don't deserve it anymore..,"" and Cap gives it a moment of hard thought as he and Tony lock eyes. Then he walks away with Bucky, leaving Tony gapsing for his breath on the ground, no words. That's it, the movie ends, we don't need to know anything else until the next one. I would have stoked.

So in my mind, Ross had to know someone was fighting as Spiderman. And if they were being so stringent with acting as a powered being under UN sanction, then at the very least Ross should have been blue in the face trying to figure out who the spider was, if he didn't sign the accords. Otherwise the whole thing falls apart if some of their guys are operating without being in compliance",4i35uf

Let's see, an alien invasion bent on conquering the Earth, Hydra, Ultron, Africa I mean the later two I can get behind. How about no mention of the events in any of the Thor or Iron Man movies all though equally destructive. The reality is the Stark family can easily be tied to almost everyone of these events directly or indirectly. To me this Marvel Universe is too heavily focused on the Starks. Not only that but Thor is a God! How could you contain him, how is this not a life altering revaltion to the people of the world? Makes no sense to me. At least in BvS they handled the alien God angle pretty well and the fights seemed exponentially more dangerous and deadly. 

Not to talk to much trash, I did really enjoy the movie and I still think Winter Soldier is the best one so far. I loved Spiderman, Black Panther was awesome, and the humor was absolutely perfect.

Edit: 10 movies in and we are all still waiting for Thanos? My favorite fight was actually Bucky's escape through the stairwell. It was well choreographed like in Winter Soldier.",4i35uf

I think once there, I believe he leaked the information about the real psychologist to start a chain reaction/investigation where Tony and Cap (who he didn't know was on his way) to him. 
He saw on the news that Cap and Bucky escaped the Government building after Zemo brainwashed Bucky so I think he concluded that Cap would reset Bucky to normal again and find out what information he gave Zemo leading those two to the base.

That only makes sense because gravity is a constant, so a large tree falling at constant gravity takes longer to fall because it has more distance to cover. So this analogy is incorrect.

This is not physics. The only things that should ""slow him down"" is if the surface area of his body increase out of proportion to how much muscle he gained, meaning he over-all didn't scale his strength properly. 

This is possible due to hand-waving that says that Ant-Man becomes stronger when he's small, maybe he becomes a bit weaker when he's big.

The 2nd Avengers I think was very forgettable and just not very good. The only thing I remember enjoying was the party at the Avengers tower.

Marvel movies can pose interesting questions to their characters.

It asks the question what if there was a superman, and he walked among us. By definition we would have to be as distrustful of him as we are with Doctor Manhattan, and Batman played that out beautifully. The Batman vs Superman fight is far and away my favorite superhero fight of all time, and that fight is the apex of Batman (and by extension humanity) working out his fear and distrust of this God-Alien among us. Batman's hatred oozes out of every action in that fight and it's marvelous. And it's only when man has overcome the God-entity and made him bleed that suddenly, Superman is a little bit more human.

Marvel movies sometimes pose interesting questions to the characters, but I never feel like they are posing those questions to the audience as well.",4i35uf

He said he's the one least likely dying to do so when Widow pled with him to stand down，which hinted he‘s not sure if Bucky was involved in the bombing attack at that point. But he hadn't managed to convince Bucky when German troops arrived, and Bucky opted to run away. From that point on, they basically lost the initiative because Cap himself was under arrest. And when Bucky took back control of his mind, they thought Zemo was going to unleash those five WSs，which was pretty urgent. Cap considered calling Tony for help but Sam mentioned Tony might have no right to act immediately as he's bound to the Accords. I don't believe waiting for UN panel to issue go-ahead order will be very Cappish. Though I do believe it would be better to brief Tony personally instead of informing and confronting him at the airport. And we certainly don’t expect him to turn Bucky in at the end of the movie. Because by doing so， he has to turn himself in and they may all end up in that floating prison.

When Rhodes got shot down and his fate was in question, Steve didn't even give a shit. Falcon and Vision were the only two people on Steve's side that were even a little bit concerned that one of their allies might be dead.

If Tony had been killed in that fight, Steve in the earlier movies would care. By the end of this film if Tony had died there I can't see Steve even batting an eye. His first concern would be getting that arm fixed.

Now that I've had time to think about it all, that's what bothered me so much. Captain America was such a poster boy for a good heroic person before this film and by the end of it I found myself completely agreeing with Tony's final words to him being 'You don't deserve that shield'.",4i35uf

d2yjrcb,"The beginning fight had some shaky cam, but the rest was phenomenal",4i35uf
d2wd4u5,"I think he means that despite CW not having these issues, it was lacking something. 
For me:

The choppiness of the action in the start. That Cap-Crossbones fight and the Bucky, Black Panther, Cap and Falcon chase sequence may been so much more epic without the shaky cam and cuts. 

The music felt underwhelming. 

Out of all the women I liked Sharon and Aunt May. Also, BP's bodyguard when she asked Widow to get out of the way. She seemed as badass as Faora after being onscreen for a few seconds. Scarlet Witch seemed to be as remorseful as Bruce Banner and then seemed to go into Hulk mode after Hawkeye's talk. Maybe her mood swings and being Vision's love interest is causing him to make decisions like shooting the wrong targets. 

The most memorable thing to me about Widow was the weird way she was sitting when she was consoling T'Challa after the bomb. Oh and how she was tossed into that truck by Crossbones. That was brutal. Also, when Bucky power bombed her into a table. Damn. 

The stairway fight in S2 Daredevil was MUCH better.  

Martin Freeman's casting seemed pointless, but maybe he has a bigger role in the future. 

I loved the new Spidey but something felt muted about his swing scenes. I don't think I will feel the same way as I felt when I saw Tobey's Spiderman swinging for the first time. Granted, it was a different time. 

The airport sequence was fun but it didn't feel like a war until the last fight.

d2wcje1,"Well, just like BvS, it was just a bunch of isolated fight scenes thrown into a weak, convoluted plot.  Zemo's motive and his odd, elaborate plan to get his revenge was eerily similar to Luthor's dumb plan to get Supes to fight Bats.  Right off the top of my head, I would have just e-mailed Stark the video clip.  I can't wait to see how the [""How It Should Have Ended"" guys](https://www.youtube.com/user/HISHEdotcom/videos) skewer Civil War.  ;)  

The cameos were a bit too much.  Just to have a battle royale.  Did Stark really need Spidey?  Ant-Man?  Of course it was nice to see, but it's just ""fan service"".  I think Captain America can carry a movie by himself.

I forget that how RT rates them, so even though I would give it a ""go and see it"" rating, I'd do the same for the mediocre BvS movie too.  That system is definitely misleading and flawed because I can't see 7 in 10 critics would say ""save your money"" for BvS.  It sucked, but it's still worth the price of admission.  ",4i35uf

The real beef is between Iron Man and Cap, and Black Panther and Bucky, so why did everyone else so blindly follow them into that fight? Black Widow and Hawkeye even comment on that in their fight, which I appreciated. They don't really even want to be fighting eachother, but because it looked good they end up brawling it out for no apparent reason.

Also, let's not forget that The Vision was conveniently not involved for the first half of the fight, which is why Spidey was taking on two at once. The Vision was easily the most powerful one there and they just sortof made him fly off-screen and do fuck-all.

2) He was all prepared to show Iron Man the video with Cap and Bucky there in the finale. He planned for them both to be there, or else what would showing just Tony the video do? Make him fly off and go find the captured Bucky and murder him? And if just Cap were there and Iron Man didn't follow them alone the video wouldn't have done anything.

I understand his distrust, but the whole accords issue was just way to black and white for me. 'you have to sign, or you'll go to jail if you carry on'.

Like /u/Jarenien said below. There were ways to bring more to the table to argue his point - like the fact that the gov were going to nuke NYC, but the Avengers ensured that was avoided.

I think there is a happy medium between the 2 massive contrasts of 'accords or no accords' the film went with, but there wasn't even a real discussion.",4i35uf

""Look, the government that you want to control what we do basically pussied out and was going to nuke an entire city, killing millions of people instead of letting us do the job we were sent to deal with.  We defied them then, which is what we are doing now by not signing, and we saved the entire city.""

Steve chose Bucky because he felt it was the right thing to do. The forces of the law wanted to take Bucky in, with orders to kill him, even though Bucky wasn't in control of his actions when he committed the crimes he had made, not to even mention, Bucky was completely innocent of the bombings in the movie in the first place. Protecting Bucky is the right call. And no most of the stuff didn't happen because Captain chose his friend over everyone else and gone rogue (he never went rogue, he was outlawed), it happened because Tony decided to sign the sokovia accord so that he can continue doing his avenging without being the one responsible for whatever mess it comes up with, even at the price of what if the governments behind the sokovia accords have a bad agenda, which is exactly what happened in the movie. 


And don't forget the whole movie is a play on Tony. Tony started with the sokovia accords because the superheroes needed to be in check, needed accountability. But the moment Tony found out they were making a mistake when he found out that the doctor who was supposed to examine Bucky was murdered and the one who did is a fake (zemo), he closed the screens on the government he worked for and went backdoor sneaky aka taking things into his own hands style, exactly what he was punishing Steve for. Then at the moment when he found out Bucky was the one who killed his parents, his immediate response wasn't to take him in as he should have done, but Tony literally took things into his own hands to kill Bucky in cold blooded murder as he knew that would appear like its lawful but everything morally wrong. 


The Captain rejected the treaty exactly because of the people in the group (he was about to sign it until he realized the government was gonna whamp up one on wanda because of how fearful they are of her) and because he saw that it was the right thing to do even though it wasn't the popular one. 


War Machine got a spinal cord injury, but that was because War machine ordered a hit on the falcon, the falcon dodged it and himself got hit by the stray laser beam. If you wanted to blame someone for that it is almost ironically a direct karma of war machine's own actions.

d2x13fk,"Yeah, thought that at first too. But then I started thinking it was more just part of the plan so that she would feel comfortable enough to come in and find the dead body. Or maybe not.

d2xtv2l,"There also would have been copious amounts of slo-mo, tracking shots that served no real purpose except for *SYMBOLISM* and muted colors everywhere.

Also, at some point, instead of Iron Man attempting to murder Bucky, he would have stopped after realizing something regarding his mom's name and Bucky said, and it would have ended in a 3 on 5 battle of Bucky, Cap and Iron Man vs the Winter Soldier Death Squad who were injected with Hulk-style super serum in the middle of a crowded city, completely undermining the film's 2.5 hour message.

So, in essence, the complete anti-thesis of a Marvel movie.",4i35uf

d2ur9w0,"Not OP, but I believe that the general concensus is that AOU spent more time stablishing other movies than setting its own plot. Also, the trailers let us to believ that it would be a dark, gritty avengers movie instead of the quip-fest we got. Ultron wasn't menancing and even if I personally think it's an okay movie, I still believe that it could had been so much more.",4i35uf
d2utxk8,"For me, it was a bit underwhelming in terms of plot structure and character building.  
  
Ultron ends up being little more than a moustache twirling villain at times and the sudden romance between Hulk and Widow feels out of place and unearned. The constant quipping gets to be a bit irritating after a while (Tony: How about nonce?) and really detracts from the serious tone Ultron is meant to bring.    
Those issues, coupled with the blatant MCU shoe-horning scenes - Thor's magical bubble bath, the clumsy introduction of Wakanda (which is totally not going to be vital in future movies, no siree), and Thor's ragnarok-induced fever dream courtesy of Scarlet Witch - made everything feel a bit too cluttered and scattershot at times, which just brought the movie down overall.",4i35uf
d2usao5,"I'm a fan of Age of Ultron, but I understand why many people felt underwhelmed by it. The film advertised a terrifyingly dark and genuinely menacing Ultron-- one that would seriously threaten the Avengers. So, when we were delivered a lighter villain that was injected with humor, many felt cheated. Personally, I enjoyed the film despite Ultron being different from what we were led to believe from the adverts. While I can't truly say I'm not curious if he would have been a better villain if he had been less quippy and more foreboding, I understood his character to be what it was due to him being Tony Stark's child, so to speak. Wanda Maximoff said of Ultron in the film that he inherited his inability to discern the difference between saving the world and destroying it from Tony, so it's not a stretch to imagine that his sarcasm and personality were somehow born from that same connection.",4i35uf
d2utc0n,It had an insurmountable level of hype. I really like Age of Ultron,4i35uf
d2uukvy,"I won't speak for everyone but for me, it was the lack of execution with the villain. The previews led me to believe that ultron was going to be this total badass but the character was much less threatening than expected. Also, instead of the team uniting against this huge nearly unstoppable force, it was more about developing a bunch of sub plots that, while probably will do a good job of setting up future films, didn't add much to add to the plot. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed AoU but I was hoping for so much more and it left me with more ""I wish they would've"" moments and less ""that was so cool when"" ones. ",4i35uf
d2uv2xy,"I'd say in my opinion, Ultron didn't really turn out to be the threat he was made out to be. Just a lot of whining. Especially the scene at the end with Vision.

d2vbut6,"I just re-watched Ultron after watching Civil War and personally, the biggest problem in the movie for me is Ultron.

d2w1p19,"It's a good movie. A fun movie.

AI that turned evil for little to no reason, with a plot that makes literally no sense - he tries to destroy the world by levitating a city, and has his incredibly advanced robots punch the Hulk.

d2xlbvk,"AoU isn't bad, it's parts are just better than its whole. Like, the Hulk vs. Iron Man fight is great, but it's completely irrelevant to the story. ",4i35uf
d2y5fba,"I personally wasn't a fan because Ultron acted pretty illogically and wasn't particularly menacing. Also, there was no reason for him to fly back and try to kill Hawkeye and end up killing Quicksilver. His main goal should have been self-preservation at that point, not revenge against the weakest Avenger in a way that would make it easier for the Avengers to destroy him.",4i35uf
d2yoln3,"There's a number of reasons.  The most commonly mentioned one was that it watered itself down trying to set up other movies.  I'm not sure how much I agree with this.  Yes, Thor's cave-bath scene doesn't work, and Black widow's RedRoom scenes don't really fly either, but they're more clunky scenes than movie-breaking.

In my opinion the movie falters because it never creates a sense of tension, a dangerous villain, which means a lot of the interaction between the superheros feels forced and unnecessary.

Ultron never wins a fight.  He never stands his ground and fights off the Avengers.  He *always* runs away.  He constantly uses diversionary tactics to keep the Avengers busy mowing down his army of weakling-bots  while he runs off to do something else.

He's a 9 foot tall killbot that never actually shows that he can beat the Avengers.  

What this does is it leaves each action scene wanting.  Each one feels 'tacked on'.  Consider the Hulk vs Hulkbuster fight.  Doesn't it feel like it comes out of left field?  Can't you just FEEL the studio conversation of ""Let's work this fight into the movie, how do we do that?""  

In the end it suffers from ""End the world"" syndrome.  That's when a movie thinks that the audience will be engaged because they don't want to see the world destroyed.  That's not really what engages us, that's not really what invests us in a movie's climax.  We get interested because we want to see our favorite *characters* succeed.  

In The Force Awakens, Star Killer base potentially blowing up another system isn't what is keeping us interested, it's the background for the showdown between Rey and Fin and Kilo.  We want to see THEM overcome and escape.  Starkiller base threatening to go off again is just the ticking clock that forces our heroes to take risks that put them in danger.  

There's little individual character growth in Ultron.  Who learns a lesson?  Who is a different person at the end?  Wanda maybe but we hardly even know her.  The first Avengers movie hits home because we see Tony take the final step towards being a real Hero:  Being willing to make the big sacrifice for others.  In Ultron it's a classic example of ""a bunch of stuff that happens"". ",4i35uf
d2yph4z,Hulk and Black Widow needed to bang. And here's the twist: they show it.,4i35uf
d311ezg,"One of the reasons why they didnt like it was because, just like all other sequels, AoU is going to be compared to The Avengers.  
This creates a bit of self defeat because one of the reasons why the first avengers was so damn good was because it was the first time this sort of thing had really happened.  

A ton of the major Heroes had standalone movies to have individual character development while The Avengers culminated all of that into a test of weather or not they can truly work together.  Not only that, it was the first movie about a super hero team that actually did some justice to the comic books.  Yes story lines were different, but the entire thing felt really fucking epic.

The villain also was much better, Loki has always wanted to rule, an he couldn't do that without help.  We knew that there was a plot bigger than just one movies surrounding this film, and it made us want more.

what did AoU have?

While it had the same character interaction as the time before, nothing was really new.  Its kind of like playing Tetris, then playing a really cheap knock off, its the same fucking thing. (not saying AoU is a cheap knock off, but you get what i mean) 

Story?   Not as compelling (which is a shame because i think if Whedon had the ability to put everything he wanted in, it would have made it a very different/better movie)

Villan, yeah hes a robot who wants to kill off all of humanity, and he has severe daddy issues.  (Loki at least had a reason to hate Thor for all the shame he was put through, and in Asgardian culture shame is really poopy to go through)

The action was also not as good.  The first fight sequence at the beginning of AoU was, in my opinion, much better and paced than any other fight scene in the movie.  Which doesnt make sense to me because i want to watch this big movie and have a huge fight unfold that makes my jaw drop (examples; Ironman swooping in and using caps shield to deflect lazer, hulk slamming shard into big ass shark thing and thor using his hammer to drive it into the beast)  Not just the avengers ALL fighting the same damn robots in the same damn place.

TBH ultron is a great villan in the comic books, but I personally didnt think he would be a good one to translate to the big screen due to the limits you have on story (you gotta pitch this shit to the corporations, and if you think about how crazy some of the stories in comics........theres a reason why we wont get the bleeding edge armor on screen folks)  Unfortunately though, most of the other high profile villains are under the rights owned by other companies, so IMHO they did the best they could.",4i35uf
d31yotf,"Marvel is kinda falling into the Burton-Schumacher Batman problem: keep killing the villains.

Because my sources say:

>Zemo's legacy was revived by his son, Helmut J. Zemo, 13th Baron Zemo who was born in Leipzig, Germany. His father taught him the idea that the Master Race should rule the world. Helmut was originally an engineer until he became enraged when reading a report about the return of Captain America and his father's death. Helmut would ultimately follow in his father's footsteps as a supervillain using his family's money and his own scientific know-how to recreate his father's work.

>He first surfaced under the alias of The Phoenix, and captured Captain America to get revenge upon him for the death of his father. He was presumed deceased when he fell into a vat of boiling, specially-treated Adhesive X. As he had not been wearing his mask when he fell into the vat, his face was hideously scarred by the boiling Adhesive X, giving his face the appearance of molten wax.[8]

>He resurfaced years later as Baron Zemo.

He's spent this whole movie suffering guilt for unintentionally causing the deaths of other people, and then in the end he's unexpectedly shoved into the same role of 'grief-stricken surviving family member of victim killed by horrific senseless violence'. If the mother of that young man who died in Sokovia had had an Iron Man suit when she confronted Tony at MIT, would she have attacked him the same way he attacked Bucky? 

Like, it's so understandable that Tony snapped. The way it was revealed was *so* brutal, and there's no way he was thinking remotely clearly anymore. But given how much *he's* struggled with all the damage he's caused and all the lives that have been lost, it's even more tragic that the truth about Bucky and his parents was revealed in a way where he had no chance to come to grips with the situation and see his own situation in Bucky's. Like if Cap could have brought himself to tell Tony the truth earlier, it still would've been ugly, but just maybe the whole thing could've been avoided.

I love, though, that they both *know* what they're doing is the right thing.  

Like, neither of them are wrong in this situation. And, that's what's heart breaking about it all.  

And maybe Stark is misguided here, because he's feeling some crushing weight of all the guilt.  

But he also singlehandedly stopped a nuke from destroying 10 million people, so, he should know, first hand, that the government are a bunch of shady fuck ups when it comes to this shit.  

(edit) In terms of complaints about the movie, though, that's my only one. And, since everyone is kind of flawed in their thinking in the movie itself, that makes sense. They're roped into believing they're bad guys for doing the right thing, and that makes them turn against each other.

Plus, the entire point of having Bucky in this movie is to remind us that the Cap is *not* some perfectly selfless guy who will always come down on the side of justice with no personal investment. His decision to intervene on behalf of Bucky based only on the *word* of somebody who already has killed countless people that we know of in TWS and whose mind has been fucked with, means that Cap is not impartial, and not somebody who should be given limitless power.

Like anybody, Cap makes decisions based on personal interest when he wants to.

Plus, I don't think they do a great job of hammering the point home in this movie... but what happened in Sokovia... the very existence of Ultron, that is literally 100% the Avengers fault. When Tony decided to unilaterally create a ""world defense system,"" he was *clearly* taking the fate of the whole world onto his shoulders in a way that ended in disaster.",4i35uf
d2ycphk,"I agree entirely -  in fact, I'm shocked so many people are on Captain America's team (assuming we're all going by the movie and not the comics). I mean, Tony was definitely in the wrong to let his emotions overwhelm him and become""consumed"" with vengeance at the end, no doubt. But when it comes to the debate about whether or not to sign the documents, CA is, IMO, completely wrong.

In fact, I'd say everything that's wrong with his view is shown when he first rescues Bucky. I mean, how many police officers did he injure/cripple/kill to save him? I know he didn't want to, but in the end he did end up beating the daylights out of a bunch of officers who were only trying to take out someone believed to be a murderer. He literally assaulted and probably killed dozens of men just to save one guy because he is close friends with him! 

Tony realized that is PRECISELY the reason that they need to be put in check. I would say he even took it a step further by playing a bit of double agent himself and breaking the law by sneaking out to [originally] help CA at the end - he was willing to step outside of the accords when he realized that there would be no civilian lives at stake, and he knew he couldn't await political approval. It was only CA and Bucky and the villain in the bunker at the end; there was no potential endangerment to others. Still slightly contradictory behavior on his part, of course, so I admit the argument set forth in this last paragraph is not as strong as my previous.

Still, on the original issue, I don't know how CA's actions where morally justifiable at times in this film. He was willing to endanger many innocent lives to save his friend - understandable from the emotional point of view, but not justifiable once EVERYONE'S lives are taken into account.",4i35uf

but yeah, civil war is more family friendly, However, my comment wasnt said with jerk intentions, but i recently rewatched Iron Man 1,  and damn, its a completely different tone from the rest of the marvel movies, Iron man is a total badass there, and he does a lot of things as Ironman, Im2 was pretty slow but then Avengers came out, and Ironman was balls to the wall badass again, since then though i think they havent really made a movie with the first iron man tone, which felt more real, and less ""cartoony"" sort of way as the recent movies have been, i know that you will say that Winter Soldier is the answer to my complaints, but believe or not, i couldnt suspend my disbelief that much, since in Cap TFA we were shown Hydra as Terribly incompetent and overly cartoony, and they were the villains in Winter Soldier.

In CA Winter Solder, when he and Natasha find out that Hydra has been incubating in Shield from the AI of Arnim Zola, the screen flashes a news clipping of Stark's death.  I assume he found out then.",4i35uf
d2usi7e,He found out Bucky killed Stark's parents cause it's part of the shit Dr. Zola shows him in Cap America: The Winter Soldier. One of Bucky's many assassinations throughout history. ,4i35uf
d2usat5,"> But he feels guilty due to the actions of the entire team. Cap doesn't share this guilt from the beginning, deciding that he can't ever second guess his own decisions. He tells Scarlet Witch as much.

Tony has more blame than the rest of the team combined. His unsecured arc tech was used to open the rift in the Avengers, he created Ultron (against Banner's advice), and he created the tech that powered those flying death ships in Winter Soldier. Cap feels guilty about the people he was unable to save or help (Bucky being first and foremost) but realizes you can't save everyone, Tony feels guilty about the consequences of his terrible, often impulsive judgement.

>Sure, but you also can't blame Stark for it. Which everyone in the prison does. It's not like the Raft was anything he ever contemplated either. In fact he continually tells the group that the reason he wants them to sign is because this way they have some control, rather than no control.

Captain tries to explain things to Stark at the airport and he just isn't willing to listen. Tony even says he was given 36 hours and it's been 24, so it's not like he can't spare 5 minutes. Like always, Tony's ego drives him into a fight that could've been solved with words.

>Okay but how did he even know that much?

[There's a scene in Winter Soldier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5FZkuu9vII) where Zola tells him. It's just a quick newspaper headline, but it comes in around 0:44.

>I think we just fundamentally disagree here. Cap does not want any oversight at all or to be held accountable for any damage he causes. Also, they both state there might be something worse coming if they don't step up and agree to it now. It's just Cap wants zero accountability for any damage he causes, choosing to focus on the good he does, while Stark is finally willing to be held accountable for his actions.

That's because Cap never creates these bad situations, he just does his best to mitigate them. He has the leadership qualities, restraint, and moral fortitude that when he intervenes he's always in the right. There were aspects of that in the first film, but the second world was far more black and white than any contemporary conflicts, so it was easier for Cap to take orders. Again, after Winter Soldier, Cap doesn't trust governments, and furthermore if he sees someone in trouble he doesn't want to wait for a bureaucracy to decide to intervene (by which time it might be too late).

>People get emotional. And frankly, considering Bucky and Cap keep attacking him when he tries to stop them without force, it makes sense that he snaps.

Yeah, you can't blame him for getting emotional, but every time Cap and Tony come into conflict, Tony's the one throwing the first punch.",4i35uf

d2usy0g,"I get that and I think it would be best in a real world situation to have some kind of check in place but in the MCU, all the stuff they were trying to set up is pretty much balls. I think having a special liason or Fury-type person in charge would be best but they were answering to the Secretary of Defense. Which is pretty stupid since he would have to handle so many problems outside of supers.


The issue isn't cut and dry. This makes it work but I like to think that Cap would bring in Bucky if he couldn't be stopped. Maybe that's naive but Cap has shown that he will do the right thing and that's why I trust him leading the Avengers over the stooge Ross. Honestly, I hope that if Cap survives phase 3, Steve Rogers becomes Secretary of Defense.",4i35uf

Marvel knows how to make a movie with several superheroes. DC clearly does not.",4i35uf
d2v28oe,"I did see the movie. The entire point of Bucky wanting to be put back on ice at the end was his self admission that he was a weapon (although decidedly less-so without his arm ) and he couldn't control himself. The point I was attempting to make was that all of your examples argue cap's point, without conceding the very large point made by the rest of the movie, especially Ironman. Yes, large levels of beurocracy can separate decision makers from the emotional impacts of their decisions. But sometimes, that's exactly what's needed. If cap's goal is to ""save as many as we can. Sometimes that doesn't mean everyone"". Then Bucky needed to go down. There is almost no chance that a weapon like Bucky can stay alive and less than 1 person will die as a result. So obviously he's given Buckys life more weight than the soldiers & civilians whose deaths he (through no fault of his own) caused.

d2vb1ih,"The way the match-ups just happened to occur still were in the favor of Stark. And even though WS is a master assassin, Rhoady is a lifelong Air Force pilot. WS only has one indestructible arm, Rhoady has two blasters in his hands, guns, and missiles. Aim high, aim low, he can't block everything. And we've seen Stark catch Rogers' shield multiple times. He gets his hands on it, game over.

Vision seemed to do nothing during most of the fight. Even in an all out brawl, no one on ones, the firepower and air supremacy were on Stark's side. Liked the movie, but I feel like since this movie was called ""Captain America... Civil War"" that's why he and WS got away, just to further the plot. Call this Iron Man 4 or whatever, and them CA gets stomped.

Regardless, good movie. I had fun watching it.",4i35uf
d2vb5x5,"Team IM wasn't clearly going for the kill either. No one other than Blank Panther was trying to kill anyone in particular. And Tony and Rhoady aren't potential WMDs, they are walking WMD.

The UN can be slow-moving since it works by consensus so having some possibilities in there for the Avengers to operate more freely in case of emergencies (to then report to the UN afterwards) and things would have been great.

That's what makes the film so frustrating. Everything could in theory have been great. Bucky could have been put on trial and deemed innocent (by means of brainwashing) like in the comics and he could have gotten psychiatric help for his problems.

Most importantly, he learned what he'd fight for and what he'd die for. The end of Winter Soldier was the end of Captain America's arc.

The final fight in Civil War was amazing and by far the most emotionally charged conflict yet. Zemo's character was the most believable and actually horrifying villain yet. He understood he couldn't take them head on. The only path to revenge was to make them kill each other. Perfect. 

Where they went wrong was continuing the movie after the fight. They shot their story down and betrayed their characters by showing those last ten minutes, it set a light tone.

X-Men is actually established, and is just recently having a string of amazing movies in their own right. Deadpool was great as well, too.

Also, until Tony found out about his parents, there was no real animosity between the two groups. Especially not Tony and Cap. They were two groups doing what they thought was right, and both sides seemed to recognize this. This is exemplified during the airport scene in which everyone is actively pulling their punches towards the other side.

He kind of implies that when he first tells Tony ""I didn't know it was Bucky,"" but then admits that he knew.

I thought BvS was laughably bad. And yes, I saw it.",4i35uf

d2w7pvi,Good point but theres gotta be a middle ground!,4i35uf
d2vzd35,Yeah. Large distributed battles are forgiving in movies like Braveheart where it's just a field of anonymous soldiers with a few main characters. It's problematic here because you want to see every character doing everything all at once.,4i35uf

d2w2xvz,...No.,4i35uf
d2wbgqb,np!,4i35uf

But T'Challa was wise enough to realize that revenge would only lead to others seeking revenge. He didn't want to be part of that. He didn't want to give birth to that.

If she was part of the a nation's army or the UN Peace Corps her commanding officer could be responsible for putting her on the field without enough training (basically that means depending what the courts interpenetrated the Avengers as either Tony or Cap would be at fault and this would actually be decided by the courts in the U.N.). That's thing with Shield disbanded is there really isn't any protocol for anyone to take Civil or Criminal charges against her. hints the Sovokia accords.

I understand that maybe they don't want his character to develop too much because he is going to have his own movie but also that was kind of many people's complaints with Age of Ultron.

This was kind of a smaller thing but I didn't like their choice of casting for Aunt May. She has always been this nice, old lady with grey hair but suddenly she's the hot aunt? It just felt weird to me and I don't fully understand why they did it. 

But the main problem I had with the movie was just what I mentioned in my previous comment, that the movie felt like it was trying to make me care about Bucky but I just didn't. During the airport fight their goal was to keep Bucky alive but I didn't really care so much about that. I don't know why, maybe just because I thought Captain America: The First Avenger was an okay movie so I never really learned to care for him that much in the first place. Either way, I just think this wasn't really my movie. I loved the action sequences and the registration drama but I just felt that, at times, the stakes didn't engross me as much as they should have.

Tony Stark is a wildly emotional, often times irrational man who in the past (and possibly still) suffers from severe PTSD. He's also an alcoholic.

He once invited terrorists to attack him and gave them his home address because his friend was *injured*. He's not exactly the most rational human being.

He saw a man (who just earlier tried to kill him and killed A LOT of innocent government workers) brutally and graphically murder his parents. Remember, it was established earlier that he never fully coped with the death of his parents and still carries emotional scars from their loss. He lost control.

""A score to settle"" wasn't the best choice of words. He's now invested emotionally in whatever happens to the world, not just Wakanda. The events in Siberia changed him, that's a significant consequence.

Spider-Man having his new toys and connections are absolutely a consequence. He's going to be like Black Panther in the sense that he now feels obligated to be a part of whatever's going on, and his youth is going to play a major role in his character development and interactions with others.

Te rest of the questions, they are exactly that. I mean what the hell will happen? It leaves us guessing, we know Cap is a fugitive, but he is doing what he thinks is right, which is what he has been doing for the entire time he's been around. The only difference now is he is in hiding.

Lex could have used the Kryptonize to kill Superman in many different scenarios since he knows Superman's secret identity. He doesn't need Batman at all.

d2wptyi,"self-ag·gran·dize·ment
noun
the action or process of promoting oneself as being powerful or important.

Pretty sure this is exactly what this means and what I meant. Thank you though for offering some specific criticism instead of the previous self-aggrandizing type I was referring to earlier. You may put down Marvel, and movies, and even your misguided attempt to correct my vocabulary doesn't mean much, but when you put down the Fedora sir, I must raise a sword of defense. Some things are unassailable and you just crossed the line buddy. 

Ok so your awesome example of the device that saves the day in this movie specifically, is the watch/ glove thingy that Stark uses for all of thirty seconds? In the middle of the movie? You know what, you may be right, it's unthinkable that a futurist, technophile-billionaire, genius might have some sort of technological weapon on his person when he is in a situation where is is actually legally restricted on when he can use his armor. I'm sure he would just walk around defenseless all the time and a watch/glove, wow! That is some crazy tech that nobody would ever be able to conceive that the writers obviously finagled to "" save the day"". Did I miss anything? So convincing. Any other mind-blowing specifics that will just tear down this movie for me and everyone else fooled by the Marvel lazy writing machine? Please teach us more. And don't support your point by continually bringing up bvs, a truly bad movie that doesn't hold a candle to anything marvel has put out. We are in a discussion thread for Civil War. My fedora stands avenged in light of your weak arguments. If I had a glove, I'd slap you in the face with it. ",4i35uf

Stark is always prepared in some way, and I don't see how having a watch gauntlet is hard to believe when he could carry an entire suit back in Iron Man 2.

As far as I was aware, he had a family in secret so by joining Iron Mans Pro accords approach he would put them out into the open.

Even without them, I just assumed when he mentioned he ""owed"" somebody, its Scarlet Witch he owes, so theres a double whammy for Caps group. He encouraged her to fight with the avengers in AoU and during that fight, her brother died saving him, so I guess theres a debt/guilt he feels he has to pay off.

I can't get behind a group of people dictating where heroes can and can't go and what they can and can't do, but there are times where I could see where he was coming from. He was seeing the best case scenario of having higher-ups keeping the team in line after having screwed up his own several times while Cap was seeing it far more cynically (which he has every reason to) as another organization like Shield/Hydra or WSC that would probably ruin everything they stood for or take horrible measures with them.

Like, what if there had been an oversight committee when he and Banner were messing around with Ultron?

Like, the movie does not imply that tony doesn't hate winter soldier any more.

I agree that having it end with cap walking away would be more impactful, but I think it's unfair to claim that nothing changed.

Tony stark was mature enough to swallow his ego and anger, and judge rationally that Falcon,scarlet witch, antman, hawkeye, are innocent in this situation. He was also, I think, able to recognize that the winter soldier was not responsible for his actions. That's why the end of the movie isn't Iron man leading a massive task force trying to hunt down cap and bucky. 

Instead, we see half the avengers forced into hiding, and tony trying to look forward.

I think a lesser man would be unwilling to stop pursuing bucky for killing his parents. But that's why Tony is a hero, and despite all the mistakes he's made in past movies, I really feel that those last scenes where he acknowledges that he may have overstepped, and leapt to assumptions, really shows his maturity and growth as a character.",4i35uf
d2v3u3x,"This. You have to remember that Tony thought all along that it was an accident, always felt bad/tormented about it (which was a big point in IM2 and the scene in the beginning here with the hologram recreation). Basically he felt that he had said goodbye to his parents for the last time on kind of shitty terms, not knowing they were going to die and beating himself up over it ever since. It was even rather brilliantly done in that it ties into and explains a lot of Tony's character as we've seen him before, rather than just being a sudden retcon. You can easily see traces of his guilt and self-loathing throughout the series and we finally got a glimpse why that is, aside from the whole gunrunner backstory.

Then he's faced with a really, really brutal video of the guy standing right in front of him killing his parents in cold blood. It wasn't even by gunshot. He beat Howard's face in. It was fucking *savage*. Spend a lifetime regretting the last words to your parents and then you find out they were deliberately taken from you is a huge thing. At that point, rationality goes out the window and knowing that it was due to brainwashing doesn't really factor into his emotional state.

Tony even acknowledges the brainwashing during the fight ""do you even remember them?"" He knows Bucky didn't mean to do it, but he did it nonetheless and that's what matters in that moment, that Bucky can be a target for Tony's rage.",4i35uf

I agree.

I enjoyed the dialogue, I thought the character arcs for Tony, Panther and Cap were all great. I enjoyed the villain and how he tied in with the overarching themes of the film.

Even though I'm firmly in Team Cap I believe Cap still has trust issues. Perhaps him going after Bucky alone stems from him believing that Tony presented him with a faith accompli by signing the Accords (or perhaps Cap thought Tony was trying to make the decision *for* them).

After Bucky is captured we have the second argument between Tony and Cap. Cap is *this* close to agreeing with Tony, until Tony inadvertently lets slip that Wanda is under house arrest, reminding Cap that Tony is not interested in Wanda making her own decision.

Btw, a lot of people have hunted for the Winter Soldier for 70 years and never finding him. All of a sudden we have a grainy video in which he kinda looks at the camera and BOOM! Continent-wide manhunt.

Because he was still recovering from being thrown 50 stories below. SW used her powers on him and it look like she was manipulating the Mind Stone(it glowed red).

u/_jvc123 literally just explained it to you - Team Cap was on save the world mission. When it was clear they wouldn't all make it to the jet without killing their friends they went into stall mode for Cap and Bucky.

> The Vision was easily the most powerful one there 

It almost feels like you didn't even watch the movie. Wanda handled his shit effortlessly. If nothing else rationalize it that those two big guns were going at it off-screen, if you want to go deeper he is the kind of guy who would analyze that situation rather than fight.

Probably. And if not he still would have created a massive rift. Zemo quite literally announced he was happy with the outcome at the end of the movie in his little pod cell. All he wanted to do was break them apart, any deaths would be gravy.

3. Spidey was unnecessary but he was fucking awesome to watch, and funny. So was Black Panther, who actually did contribute to the conflict with his vengeance quest against Bucky. Plus he summed up the themes of the film nicely at the end.

4. Debatable. They're completely different so I don't even want to compare them. But at least the film didn't turn Tony into a straight up villain, recruiting other villains and staying a manhunt for Cap. His motivations made sense here. Once he learnt why Cap was protecting Bucky he sensibly stood off. Cap's motivations I wasn't really happy with, needed to be expanded upon more, but maybe that's just me falling on Stark's side 

5. Hugely disagree. Zemo was almost an anti-Marvel villain. No grand, end-of-the-world plot. No superpowers. No cheesiness. Just a normal man, with a good motivation which actually made him sympathetic (and, again, tied in nicely with the film's themes), and a cunning plot.

Plus, the Sokovia Accords are still in effect. Cap, Falcon, Ant-Man, Hawkeye, Wanda, and Black Widow are still fugitives. And now Black Panther is working with them so if Ross finds out he's a fugitive too. This is going to change how the next movie goes about things. ",4i35uf

d2vachd,"My only real complaint was the quips. Not every chapter of a story has to be more engaging than the one before it.

It could have been better, but it's part 2 in a trilogy, and not every franchise will be like The Godfather or Star Wars where that part of the story is more memorable than the first. Especially in a franchise where most of the grunt work and character development comes from the ""solo"" films.

Hank Pym is a pacifist that hates violence(but will engage in it when necessary) and the atrocities of humanity, Ultron's brain wave patterns are based on Hank Pym's brain waves and thoughts, therefore, Hank Pym's thoughts on humanity's failures, were the first to come to surface as Ultron's thoughts but Ultron took those thoughts to the EXTREME. Ultron is the twisted version of Hank Pym's mind, a mirrored image and all the while wanting please his father(Hank Pym) by being better than him by doing what he thinks Hank Pym should do.

Eg:  the hulk/black widow relationship comes out of nowhere.  More establish dialogue would have really helped.

There has to be missing dialogue explaining what happened between the end of iron man three and this movie that got cut.

Ultron's motives, plan, and relationship with quicksilver and the scarlet witch feels massively half baked.  This makes me suspect that important dialogue hit the cutting room floor to make space for the stupid cave scene.

As Peter outside the suit it's less obvious, but Garfield was the better actor, and played a more modern take on an outsider/geek than Tobey's version, which was outdated even by 2002. ",4i35uf

I think they are miles better than the ASM films in terms of writing, fun, direction, acting, and etc. I think Spider-Man 2 is actually the best and one of the best super-hero films. It has lots of fun and great intentional cheese mixed with fantastic action and character drama. I like ASM but it doesn't compare in my opinion.

I, personally, stay the hell away from 3D at all costs, even at the expense of a larger screen.

Girl, you just let the man who almost certainly killed his father get away, and you met the man before his father died, and then even spoke to him right after his passing...

Of course, Black Widow turned out to have done the right thing, but I still felt that this was perhaps the only moment out of character in the whole film. Certainly not enough to knock it down to a 4-star :P",4i35uf

d2uuqg4,"Which is why this is, imo, the best film marvel has made yet. Ignoring the cool ass fight scenes and all of the fan service, it was quality film, not just a good superhero flick. It had great visuals, great writing, an intriguing plot, and some of the best pacing I've seen from such a large scale movie. The only criticisms it left me with were minor such as the forced relationship with cap and vision's ineptitude despite building him up so much in AoU. I will for sure be going to watch again in theaters but as of now, I'd give it an 8+/10. ",4i35uf
d2v53z0,"This is the one thing about the movie I don't like. That would be a perfect place to just be like ""yeah well you made Ultron."" Every single thing that's happening in this movie is Tony's fault and no one calls him out for it.",4i35uf

Tony worshipped his father and even now he's obviously uneasy about how much he meant or what he should have been etc. Difficult is an understatement. 

For Cap to drop it so easily....to call him Howard.....to not be carrying the ghost of Howard's legacy......it's insane envy for Tony. ",4i35uf

I almost teared up. ",4i35uf
d2y5khr,"I was really hoping Cap would look at him and say something like ""Your father would be ashamed of you"" or imply that Howard would have been on Steve's side in all of this if he was still alive.

Maybe that would have been too fucked up for Cap to say right after he just laid out Tony.",4i35uf
d2uqipa,"Because he needs Bucky, Tony, and Steve all in the same place, preferably alone, because the only way Steve would (in Zemo's mind) kill Tony would be to protect Bucky.

d2ur7dv,That scene made me really mad and I think that was the intention. Spidey has always been a lot like Cap. Tony went there with the goal of manipulating him. Tony is a bit narcissistic even when he's trying to do what he thinks is the right thing. ,4i35uf

Tony calls and tells him to do something, Peter responds, ""Hey, is this another nice guy from Brooklyn just trying to save the world or an actual villain?""",4i35uf
d2utwwe,"I'm actually going to have to disagree here.

Steve doesn't embody helping the little guy anymore. Maybe he did at one point, but now he's so consumed by this broad sense of ""duty"" that his vision has narrowed to the point of complete ignorance.

Tony sees the little guy, and it's because he sees all these individual people that he's wrought with guilt and PTSD. He sees the names, the faces of the peoples' lives who were lost as a direct result of their actions.

Steve doesn't see that anymore, because to him, those were acceptable losses. In the end, you saved more than you lost so you did good, you got the job done. Bad guys lost, Good guys won. 

To Tony it's the opposite; no losses are acceptable losses. He's desperate to atone for the consequences of his actions and Steve really isn't, which is something that bugged the shit out of *me*.

The two characters have seen a total shift in their personalities over the films. Tony's gone from a selfish to almost *too* responsible and Steve has shifted from sweet-as-pie-do-gooder to a soldier obsessed with the ""greater good"" as he sees it.

I will agree that Tony was a fair bit manipulative, but I don't think it's correct to assume that Spidey and Cap are two peas in a pod. They're really not, at least, not in the MCU.

In the comics it was different, the whole topic was different as well as the character dynamics so you could say those two were alike in that context but not in the MCU, imo.",4i35uf

d2uu6db,"if I were a betting man, id say that will be an important piece to his character development in the future. he's just a kid. of course he is going to listen to and accept whatever one of his idols and most famous people in the world tells him. growing into his own man and own hero with his own morals and motives will be a key piece to this spidey, I think.

d2v6ydy,"It really bothered me to see people wailing on him full force. Of course they don't know he's just a kid, but it was making me cringe with parental concern for him. ""He's just a boy who has been manipulated, stop throwing him through planes!"" ",4i35uf
d2vux16,"I thought that was a brilliant subtle dig at Tony being a bit self-serving. When he asked Peter Parker why he fought crime, Peter basically gave Cap's rationale for opposing the Sokovia Accords: ""If I can do the things I can, but I don't, and someone gets hurt, I'm at fault"" is pretty much a rephrasing of ""If I see a situation going south and I can help it, I'm not going to stay out of it.""

I thought for sure that was foreshadowing Spider-Man switching sides, but as it was, it worked as a great way of showing that Tony had some hypocrisy and manipulation on his side more than Cap did.",4i35uf

Plus, there's that nice little moment at the end of their fight where he and Cap recognize each other as fellow New Yorkers. Seems like an indication that they will be working together again in the future,

Everyone knows the identity of every avenger just about. They're not secret and can easily be goaded into a fight. Look at Zemo's plan for Bucky. 

Spiderman knows he is stronger than 99% of the population but remains relatively in the shadows as a public figure. He stays within his borders as a person. Cap on the other hand, while not doing it for publicity, isn't realizing the destruction he's causing. If he busted Bucky at the beginning the movie ends. Instead hundreds of people die, again, because of his choices. ",4i35uf
d2v9k4i,"That's pretty much how I feel also. The movie has a much better story than the comics, it feels way more grounded and real. I also really like how they are using Tony as a paternal figure for Peter, I can't wait for Homecoming.",4i35uf
d2yimi9,"Exactly. For as much as they make Captain America not want to kill people, I guarantee at least one of those officers was seriously hurt if not killed. If he didn't, Bucky sure did. Not to mention they got Rhodes freaking paralyzed. It's not even like they wanted to put these guys on a registry or track their movements, all they wanted was the Avengers to not go fucking shit up without any kind of approval from the countries they operate in. The best part is, in the end, he was totally wrong. The whole grand master plan was split the a Avengers, which Cap played into perfectly. There was no real threat at all. If Cap signs the documents then there is no conflict. If there was a situation in the future where he felt he needed to intervene immediately with no time to waste, then he could just go off like Tony did.",4i35uf

d2xl4mi,"Ultron was created because Tony let his ego take over, thought he could meddle with high advanced and unknown alien tech, and no one stopped him. Ultron wasn't born out of a fight gone bad, he was born in a lab. So maybe the restriction shouldn't be on the fighting, but rather on meddling with technology that is beyond their understanding. The same thing happened with the Tesseract.

Rule One when dealing with infinity stones is to lock them up and not use them *at all*. The Asgardians know this (or at least, Thor *should* have known this, really dropped the ball there) and the Nova Corp know this. Humans though, are immature in the whole galactic forces game, and so have no friggin clue what the hell they're doing. Like a kid playing with matches. 

New York, Washington, even Lagos - those were fights where the alternative was worse and were going to happen because the bad guys are bad (and so far it's been mostly Hydra and Thanos pulling the strings) and someone has to stop them. Ultron had nothing to do with Hydra or Thanos, he should have never happened. ",4i35uf

But suddenly put that powerless organization in charge of the most powerful people on the planet? You think organizations like Hydra are gonna sit back and be like ""Welp, the U.N. has them, guess we're gonna fight the U.N. now"". It would be S.H.I.E.L.D. all over again, except that to have any sway in the U.N., Hydra will be targeting and concentrating power in multiple countries, making the problem worse in the end.

d2usb7q,"Gotcha. That's a cool Easter egg, but it seems a little on the subtle side for how big a reveal this is in Civil War. ",4i35uf
d2usug9,">Tony has more blame than the rest of the team combined. His unsecured arc tech was used to open the rift in the Avengers, he created Ultron (against Banner's advice), and he created the tech that powered those flying death ships in Winter Soldier. Cap feels guilty about the people he was unable to save or help (Bucky being first and foremost) but realizes you can't save everyone, Tony feels guilty about the consequences of his terrible, often impulsive judgement.

Great point. But Tony made the arc tech on that level to provide clean sustainable energy to NYC. It's not like he contemplated a god showing up and using it to open a portal to the Chithauri. He created Ultron to prevent another Chithauri like invasion since he saw the full extent of their forces (flashbacks in Iron Man 3 and his aggressive PTSD). I don't think he figured it would go sentient. And he made the tech for the ships for SHIELD, not Hydra. Again, he didn't know that Hydra had thoroughly infiltrated SHIELD. He even talks about how he shut down his weapons division because he didn't want to be a merchant of death. Stark makes things to benefit humanity, but for the most part, it's corrupted by situations no one would contemplate happening. Cap doesn't just feel bad about the people he couldn't save, he also ignores the fact that his actions put people in harm's way. 

>Captain tries to explain things to Stark at the airport and he just isn't willing to listen. Tony even says he was given 36 hours and it's been 24, so it's not like he can't spare 5 minutes. Like always, Tony's ego drives him into a fight that could've been solved with words.

Stark's on a deadline. Cap is too. Stark repeatedly asks him to stand down and goes so far as to beg him to come with. 

>[There's a scene in Winter Soldier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5FZkuu9vII) where Zola tells him. It's just a quick newspaper headline, but it comes in around 0:44.

That's fair, but as I said to someone else, that's a super brief and easily missed set up to one of the biggest reveals in this film. 

>That's because Cap never creates these bad situations, he just does his best to mitigate them. He has the leadership qualities, restraint, and moral fortitude that when he intervenes he's always in the right. There were aspects of that in the first film, but the second world was far more black and white than any contemporary conflicts, so it was easier for Cap to take orders. Again, after Winter Soldier, Cap doesn't trust governments, and furthermore if he sees someone in trouble he doesn't want to wait for a bureaucracy to decide to intervene (by which time it might be too late).

I think I actually just dislike this about the way he's written. If he's always so damn righteous, then what's the point of anyone disagreeing with him? Just because he doesn't like government doesn't mean he'll always be right. And lest we forget, how many soldiers who were not in any way evil did he severely injure to save Bucky? They were just German soldiers, responding to a known threat. He leaves a trail of damage and bodies behind him on his righteous mission, but doesn't claim responsibility for it because he has the moral high ground? I think his inability to see the nuance is his great failing and I loved that the movie started to go there, but I wish they'd committed to it. 

>Yeah, you can't blame him for getting emotional, but every time Cap and Tony come into conflict, Tony's the one throwing the first punch.

Don't remember the film well enough to argue that. ",4i35uf
d2vmwis,"Yeah, but I mean he happens to be right about there being a bigger a threat that needs to be addressed. Iron Man even takes his side. He was also right about the secret prison. But you're right, he was dead wrong about the motivation. ",4i35uf

d2urv66,"B vs S suffered from a single fault that spawned the entire mess of a movie:  They tried to create a DC version of the MCU with a single movie instead of putting in the time, money and effort into doing it the right way with multiple movies.

They stuffed in 4 movies worth of content and relevant points in order to set the stage for a JL movie and it fell apart under its own bloated weight.  ",4i35uf
d2v38op,"The movie absolutely did take sides. 

That was the whole point of a certain someone reversing himself. He saw that he had made a huge mistake, and had to walk back from it. We saw numerous examples of this, but specifically on where the power should be held, the main characters (on both sides) make it absolutely clear where it needed to be held. 

Bucky was just a tool. He didn't have any free will to decide what he was going to do when he was under someone else's control (Hmm pretty obvious metaphor here, of the soldier who is just following orders). The issue wasn't truly with Bucky, but with who had control over him. Bucky knew that as long as that was a risk (and with the existence of certain groups that like to make their decisions in secret, that risk is always there) he'd put himself out of it. He decided that, not some committee that was going to do it based on lies. Again demonstrating where the power ultimately lays, where it belongs.

The movie didn't equivocate on this. Sure, it started off giving you the perspectives of both sides, the valid reasoning behind it all. Even a certain smarty pants used all of his programmed genius to decide that it came down to an equation - ""one life vs many"", ""one deciding vs many deciding"". But that side was *wrong*, and the winners of the debate proved it, demonstrated it, by showing all the flaws with their opponent's reasoning, and kicking some ass while at it. The film wouldn't have been satisfying if all of this didn't click with our innate sense of morality.

This was a deeply political film, not in the sense of left vs right, liberal vs democrat, but about the most fundamental question of the individual vs the group, the rights and freedom of one over the rights and freedoms of the many (and vice versa). And yes, I know how ridiculous this sounds given the rest of the movies in this series, but the filmmakers tricked us with their fun mindless nonsense so that they could set up scenarios like this, and look at the best case/worst case scenario of such a fundamental question.",4i35uf
d2v3dlh,"No worries. The thing is, the movie does a great job of presenting the logic and reasoning behind the Ironman's decisions. The supporting characters chime in with why it seemed like the right thing to do. A matter of an equation, says Vision. 117 countries can't be wrong, says the hot one (literally - practically the whole world is against you on this, so, ... you're probably wrong). It can't hurt to have some oversight and maybe some added ""accountability"" to their actions... could it?

The Accords and the break up have some implications for the future, but these consequences weren't really explored in the end this movie itself.

Steve seems to have given up the Captain America identity.

In Spider-Man: Homecoming, I can see Tony pressurizing Peter to stop being an illegal vigilante either by hanging up the webs altogether until he's 18, or by becoming a fully UN sanctioned Avenger.

In Black Panther, it's possible that the UN will learn that Wakanda is offering sanctuary for Bucky, and maybe there will be some political chaos ensuing from that.

In Ant-Man & Wasp, they're also gonna be illegal vigilantes. Hank Pym will not be happy about Scott's participation in the Civil War.

I think its understandable that from a civilian perspective, it seems that the Avengers just go around, fight it out, and leave everyone else to deal with the aftermath. This is further aggravated by the fact that Tony created ultron, so what happened there was completely 100% the avengers' fault, yet they didn't stick around afterwards to save those caught in the devastation.",4i35uf
d2uye5d,grief is irrational. Ultron no longer existed so he moved on to the next thing. Bucky was brainwashed but that didn't stop Tony from trying to kill him and even Cap for getting in the way.,4i35uf
d2v0efn,"Yep he did, it's heavily hinted in TWS. And in TWS it's suggested that Howard found out about Hydra in SHIELD. It also seems like he perfected the super soldier serum from all those years ago and Hydra were after it. We don't know where they were going, presumably to hide it.

He got the book before the bombing. He wanted to know where Bucky and the other soldiers were held, but the guy wouldn't tell him...so he said he had to do something he didn't really want to do, bomb the UN and frame Bucky.",4i35uf
d2vc1m8,"Yeah, and even though we didn't get a lot of Vision I thought the movie took him to an interesting place with his philosophy and all that. I'm excited to see where he goes from here.",4i35uf
d2weeyz,The emotion in the final fight was the part that really got to me,4i35uf
d2wgneb,"He is going to appear in future movies, so they aren't done with the character yet.",4i35uf
d2wgucs,"Look at his other comments, it's like a 15 year-old wrote them. And I dislike his comments.",4i35uf
d2x3vk8,The CGI in that one wasn't as good. I am not sure if the two movies used different FX houses. That or RDJ's face was simply easier to de-age because of the shape or something like that. Still WAY better than Tron though. ,4i35uf
d2uqcx2,Imma let you be.  We're done.  We'll continue this after seeing the X-men movie.  Agreed?,4i35uf
d2uwqoj,"Agreed. Kevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios has said: [""I don’t think it is quite fair to say DC is finally getting their act together. The Dark Knight movies were rather successful and genre-defining – they altered the genre in big ways. So I think there has always been competition that way. I mean, Iron Man was the number one movie of 2008 until The Dark Knight came along, and I loved it, frankly. I love that the number 1 and the number 2 movies of that year – and it has happened a number of times since then – [were] comic-book movies, even if it wasn’t one we made. Here we are now, 14 years since the first Marvel movie I worked on. At that point it had been eight years and for those eight years people had been asking ‘How much longer [is this] gonna last?’ ‘When are people gonna get tired of these movies? And my answer always was ‘People only get tired if a whole slew of terrible ones come out’. And it’s our job to make sure that doesn’t happen. If there are other people out there interested in that not happening as well, I’m all for it!""] (http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/kevin-feige-talks-dc-films-says-captain-america-3-has-large-vision-wont-move-from-date-with-batman-v-superman-20140718)

He even credits Justice League in a way for inspiring the Avengers (in comic-books I mean) when asked about Justice League [""I think there have been a lot of great DC stories and there are a lot of great DC characters, and if they focus on those things the audience will be interested.  It was a very unique model that we were lucky enough to be able to do – introducing each individual hero before introducing The Avengers.  That, to me, is what was always interesting about The Avengers.  The Avengers are not The Guardians of the Galaxy, are not The Dirty Dozen, where you spend a movie introducing each character and putting them together for the first time.  The Avengers was cool because they were preexisting characters that teamed up for a big event.  I think that’s why Justice League was cool, Justice League was first.  That’s what they did first in comic form.""](http://collider.com/justice-league-movie-kevin-feige/)

And last but not the least, on superheroes and/or comic-books film in general: [""I've always said, if they are all good, the more the merrier. It's a bad thing for us when one of them is not well received. If we have a good movie, and they have a good movie, it only helps us""](http://www.comicbookmovie.com/iron_man/kevin-feige-addresses-the-comicbookmoviecom-flame-wars-im-excited-to-see-a78157)

d2uu9ps,"I would hope DC would see this and strive to beat this especially comparing the reactions of this movie and Supes v Bats.  

I just want DC to know that you don't need to be solely dark, it does fit in certain aspects, i believe they just can't do that with Justice League. 

I do think Snyder is a great director but I rather see something original from him.  I think that's his thing.  He needs that creative freedom. ",4i35uf

d2w9asr,"I see.  I hadn't read it myself, but I was told about Spider-Man having his identity revealed because of it, which causes villains to go for his family, which I thought could have been pretty interesting in a film.

d2wcrbm,"Yep. I think Marvel did a good job making Captain America feel human. He laughs. He makes jokes. He seems like a cool guy to hang around with. 

In contrast, Superman and Batman in *Batman vs Superman* were cold and stoic. Bruce and Clark didn't laugh or made jokes in that movie. I wouldn't care if both characters died. ",4i35uf

Not just because storytelling in comics and movies are different, but also because Civil War is a storyline that would need *at least* 4-5 movies to tell, even if adjusted for the comic book universe. The story is just that massive.

That said, I don't think what you said really applies to the movie. Nobody would hate Tony if the death of Rhodey caused a split between him and Cap. In fact, I doubt many people were thinking 'Man, Tony's a dick' as Rhodey hit the ground.

The problem I have is with your statement, because it reflects Marvel/Disney's current mindset. There's nothing wrong with causing a rift between two characters, especially because that causes character development. The problem is, exactly as you said, they are playing it safe. More and more as these movies get popular, Marvel is allowing less and less character development and opportunities for character moments. Which is sad, because there's so much potential for good storytelling with these characters.

Which, in the long run, is going to leave everyone sore. Especially with the next Avengers movie, when we're going to go back into the movie with the status-quo pretty much restored. The only difference will be two groups of Avengers instead of one...fighting the same fight.",4i35uf

And to your point about ""where does it say he is idolized"" clark literally says himself that the cops are helping him. Nobody at any point in the film says ""oh that Batman guy is a problem"" they intentionally make it look to clark like Batman is respected because he never gets any flak while superman does constantly.

A few thoughts, I think what really pulled me out of the movie is that the movie asks us to take it seriously and consider the consequences of the movies(Both tonally and thematically). It then goes on to not really do a good job of being serious or having consequences. A huge part being that the backstory of the MCU that's been built up since 2008 felt largely ignored. They love pointing out the destruction that's been going on around the world, but there is absolute zero discussion of the context of those acts. Context that's extremely important. A huge example, in my opinion, are the events of Winter Soldier. While discussing the Avengers having oversight and accountability, the destruction from Winter Soldier is brought up as an example. What isn't brought up is the fact that the destruction in Winter Soldier was *caused because The Avengers had oversight*. 

And I know I'm going to get flack for what I'm about to say, but I think that's why BvS was right in getting this sort of storyline out of the way as early as possible. The DCU does not have a whole lot of baggage in its backstory like the MCU does at this point. It was allowed to focus on a single event, and build controversy around that singular point, making it more focused. Civil War trying focusing this similar controversy around 5 or 6 events, and feels less tied together because of it. Especially when the context of those events are laregly thrown out, and the only thing focused on is 'there was collateral damage'.

Continuing on over consequences, too much of the cast felt like they were there just to be there. Hawkeye is a great example. He comes out of retirement, leaving his family that we've established is an extremely important part of his life, and not only risks death but actively becomes a world criminal just by showing up. And the closest thing we have to why he was so willing to abandon his family, and risk never seeing them again, is 'Family life was boring, haha!'

I know I'm going to get flak for this as well, but I just felt like Tony was poorly handled. He makes a huge stink over the Accords, even becoming the poster child for the Accords similar to how he does the Super Hero Registration Act in the comics. However, he never follows through with any of it other than to have his friends arrested. He actively ignores the Accords and oversight throughout the entire movie.

Which, as an aside, I think is funny that there's been so much talk about how Tony was handled better in the movie than in the comics regarding Civil War. That Tony was turned into a monster in the comics, and that he feels more relatable in the movie. I really don't want to compare the two stories as they're clearly EXTREMELY different, but this is something that has stood out to me in the discussion, and it's a thought that's been lingering in my head.

Tony in the comic does some bad stuff, there's no doubt about it. However, everything he does, he does with conviction for the fact that he firmly believes he's doing the right thing. He is making the country a better place by getting super powered people registered, and giving them the training they need to control their powers. He fights Cap and team because he firmly believes that things will only get much worse in the country without the Super Hero Registration Act.

In the movie, Tony's decisions felt like they were only there to further fuel and protect his ego. He doesn't want to take responsibility for what he's done, so he shifts that blame to The Avengers and other super powered people(Let's not forget something that gets completely glossed over in the movie: Sokovia happened because *Tony* had no oversight and was never held accountable for creating Ultron). Not only this, but Tony continues to act with zero accountability or resolve for the Accords that *he* pushed for. We see this in things like him recruiting a 16 year old kid, kidnapping him across continental lines, and then running off to find Cap at the end without telling anyone.

That said, I *do* feel like the way Tony is portrayed is a failure of the movie, and the side Tony is supposed to represent. Especially since, so far, every single time I mention him kidnapping Parker the only response I get is 'Tony can do what he wants, he's a genius billionaire'. Which is the exact opposite point that Tony's side represented. Tony's side, along with the Accords, were supposed to represent accountability for individuals who are so powerful that they can do whatever they want. Yet when Tony blatantly does whatever he wants in the movie with zero repercussions, people just say 'LoL, he can do what he wants! He's Tony!'",4i35uf
d2uqifu,"That's where I really became conflicted and shifted sides. Nothing Bucky did was really excusable, and by defending him and fighting his way to the end, Capt basically had blood on his hands also. ",4i35uf
d2xoeaq,"Maybe, or maybe that's just because it was a Captain America movie. I feel like movie left it up to the viewer to decide who they agreed with",4i35uf
d3112bp,"So the fact Bucky had spent 60+ years being tortured, tormented and brainwashed and as soon as he got free from that someone framed him and had him hunted down had no effect on you?

And you're criticising them for casting someone too young and hot to be the aunt of a teenage boy? She's age-appropriate, and if anything the 'old grey-haired lady' is too old to be the aunt to a 17yo in Spider-Man 1. The Raimi version of Aunt May is more like Great Aunt May.",4i35uf
d3009yh,"As movies, in a vacuum, with no regard to the history of the comic books or previous comic book movies, I'd give them both 3 out of 5, but for different reasons. 

BvS is extremely well shot, lit, acted, and the CGI is beautiful. The action scenes are delicious and fresh and interesting with amazing fight choreography. The exposition is lengthy, overlong, but still interesting. The character motivations are good on paper, even Superman's, but the execution is where it starts to fall apart. It's edited harshly, scenes don't pay off, characters say and do dumb things, and it comes to pretty cliche finale. It also breaks away from the action several times to set up other movies in the franchise in the most obvious, boring way. 3/5

CW is shot, lit, and acted like a TV show, grinds along with copious amounts of boring, people-talking-across-a-table exposition, feels like two different movies tonally, has far too many disposable, uninteresting, CGI, video-game, zero-stakes, PG-13 action scenes, and overall feels like an extended trailer for future Marvel movies. With this movie, the Marvel universe doesn't feel like a cinematic experience to me anymore, just a business model with a permanently broken fourth wall that prevents me from suspending disbelief. 3/5",4i35uf

The same conclusion was met. 3D was the better experience by far. I'd go so far as to suggest perhaps you were met with a bad apple at your 3D showing because it was still night and day.

Theater 1: 3D 9/10 video 10/10 audio (Dolby Atmos)

Theater 2: Standard 7/10 video 9/10 audio 

Theater 3: IMAX 3D 10/10 video 10/10 audio

Theater 1: Standard 7.5/10 video 10/10 audio (Dolby Atmos)

The darkness issue wasn't as bad the second time I saw it in standard, but it was still a problem and very very noticeable. IMAX 3D was easily the best format of all of them. Only one of the smattering of people I went to the movies with accompanied me to all 4 showings, but she echoed my sentiments.

Kevin Feige even admitted that he only went with the build route because no one even knew marvel characters.Even then they sacrificed Iron man 2 to just build avengers (which resulted it in becoming a mess just like bvs).

Sure, they sent in a shrink, but due process doesn't seem to be a factor. Anyone they label a vigilante/criminal doesn't seem to have any rights.

The accords was a pretty thick document, though, so there could be plenty of info about what constitutes eligibility for it, but I'd guess it's planned to cover anyone who is being a vigilante (or who won't come work for the UN, I bet) with their powers/tech, so Ant-Man, Spidey, whoever are probably all considered fair game.",4i35uf

But we get no scene of Ant-Man’s reaction to the accords. He just shows up and is like “cool, I’ll do what you say because Captain America”. He’s just-there.

Why does Tony think Spider-Man is such a danger to Steve? Why does he choose him specifically? Moreso, where do they explain it?

There’s even several jokes about “don’t hit me so hard”, “I don’t know if you’ve ever been in a fight before”, “I’m just doing this to impress Mr. Stark”.

d2x7obl,"The accords only pertained to the Avengers. Spider-Man could have stayed in **QUEENS** and it wouldn't have affected him at all. 

They strayed away from the original material in Civil War, the SRA, which actually DOES affect every hero. And I think that change weakened the movie. ",4i35uf
d2x3gq8,"For a start-

The only reason you think that was an appropriate term is because you clearly think someone who dared to disagree with your superhero wet dreams thinks he’s “all powerful”. No man, it’s just called dissent, and it’s called recognizing good writing. Cap 1 and Cap 2 were great films, great writing, this one was a little lazy. I’m sorry this has set you off.

It’s not my only example- you seem to be an expert. Go back and watch ALL of these films. The futuristic technology is how they get themselves out of EVERYTHING. And that’s fine- it really is! But when it has no limitations, it gets boring and lazy and it’s not good writing- and thats my point. Lets look at Ultron- even with all it’s flaws. The Hulk is on an unstoppable rampage! Oh no! But it’s OK because suddenly Tony has the Hukbuster suit. What? Yeah it looks awesome, and the fight scene is great, and it sold some toys but at what cost?

Wouldn’t it be MUCH better writing if controlling Hulk was something the Avengers had to battle with constantly? That they had to weigh the cost of setting Hulk loose against the destruction he causes? Is it worth to piss Bruce off? Can we stop him? Will he be able to stop? Who will he hurt? How much will he destroy? Are we willing to risk pissing Bruce off to accomplish this goal- despite the destruction it causes.

THAT’S GOOD WRITING. You know what’s not? The Hulk is loose! Don’t worry guys, I happen to have been working on this massive robot for exactly this situation and it happens to be ready and perfect. Problem solved. We never have to worry about this. Moving on....

See what I mean?

Everything just happens to be there when it needs to be there- at the exact time its needed. Deus ex Machina vary rarely is used well- and Marvel seems to be relying on it more and more to move the plot along, squeeze in more fights, more hero’s, and sell more toys.

Just because these are popcorn movies, it doesn’t mean they have to get lazy- and they are. You clearly have a rock hard hard on for Marvel, which explains why my daring to say Civil War had some plot flaws made you feel I was somehow “self aggrandizing” (I still can’t reconcile how you came to that conclusion after knowing what it means), but you should maybe deserve better. It has nothing to do with Marvel, or their films. It has everything to do with good story telling.

Michael Pena in Ant-Man, for instance, gave us the ability to see the West Coast Hispanic side of this Marvel world. It was fun, it was different, and you couldn't do that without shoe-horning in a non-Hispanic character into a Hispanic culture.

Basically if his strength scaled correctly you wouldn't see any ""slow motion"" effect. He should appear to move at the same relative agility, just at a much larger size. 

I think people have just watched too many monster and Godzilla movies that did this to give protagonists time to run away against large creatures. In reality size doesn't make people go in slow-motion. 

If you think about it, if Ant-Man could move a the appropriate speed at that size, he would easily be able to grab Stark and Rhodie out of the air and there is nothing they could do about it.

I just think it's doing a disservice to the character to not show how powerful he is. Spider-Man is not the Hulk, but he's a multitudes stronger than Captain America. In the very same scene, he stops TWS' punch like he was catching a fly, turns his hand in his grip, and makes a funny remark. Steve Rogers does that, he gets his butt knocked down.

As for the Iron Man scene at the end, I can see Iron Man pulling punches so as not kill Cap, but Cap beating Iron Man and then punching his shield through that armor? That's where I had to kind of look at Captain America as the new version of movie Wolverine...no one can beat him, I guess. That armor would take character like the Thing or Thor to tear through. Hell, in the same MCU, it took Thor strength to kind of crush the armor on his wrist....but Cap can beat through it? I just expected more out of the Marvel team.

Rhodey broke his spine, is having new legs built by Stark, doesn't regret a thing. We gained characters instead of losing them.

d2upjun,"Yes, I realize that that would have been a bit problematic. I can think of a few in-world workarounds. 

1. Workaround 1: Like Dare Devil, he's been doing his shtick for a few years. He's relatively low key, fighting small time villains and the like, but is secretive enough about his identity, and being caught on film, that even though SHIELD knows about him, he's not high profile enough to make much of an impact on the members of the Avengers themselves, who've had bigger problems to deal with.

2. Workaround 2: Don't thrust Spider-Man into a battle scene in his first Marvel film. Introduce the character in a brief cameo, give him his own film, and then have him shaking it up with the Avengers.

3. Workaround 3: Start where Sony's Amazing Spider-Man 2 left off with the same actor, and the same world. That Spider-Man's already been doing his thing for awhile, but he's had no reason to come into contact with the Avengers until he, I don't know, crosses path with an escaping Winter Soldier or something. Parker plays a bit of a busybody, and gets *himself* involved. This would also work without using Sony's world I think.

Anyways, I'm sure I could think of a number of other ways of getting the character into the film without it feeling like it compromises Stark's agenda, but damage is done now...",4i35uf

If it's any consolation, after reading up on some other reactions I do have to praise the fact that the intention of this movie was (much in the spirit of the comic universe) to drive the plotline forward through character interactions instead of the generic good vs bad dynamic. The problem is that the plot was reduced to, as you said ""Team Cap was on save the world mission"". Iron Man is painted as arbitrarily fascist and unreasonable, and, at least for me, the idea that the characters are dealing with emotional and personal conflict is mutually exclusive to painting one side/character as good or bad. If it weren't all about golden-boy Cap it would be interesting

As for Scarlet Witch vs. Vision, she caught him unaware and I think [this](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/captain-america-civil-war-who-would-win/) is a good comparison of relative strengths, in which they state ""Scarlet Witch would beat Vision one-on-one about a third of the time based on [their] analysis."" This is by no means a fact, but credit given to the work done that shows that, at the very least, Vision can be considered one of the most powerful about equal to Hulk and Thor.

Okay, I'm not asking 100 kids because why would I care that much and secondly, Peter Parker isn't just some average millennial. He was a nerdy, excluded boy-genius who was meant as an embodiment and reflection of all the kids who could relate to his situation, and call me old-fashioned but I'd like to see those original values embodied in any iteration of Spidey as I consider it intrinsic to his character.",4i35uf

He's not a megalomaniac or super evil power hungry villain;  he's a broken man consumed by desire for vengeance for what the avengers did to his family.    
  
His story fit in perfectly with the overall themes of consequences for actions.  And at the end, he did win.

d32iift,"It's a Civil War in a sense that it splits the superhuman community (in the comics anyways) right down the middle. In the MCU it has to be scaled down for budget/universe reasons. In the comics, Cap goes into hiding and uses guerrilla tactics to help fight crime but each time they do so they lose allies to SHIELD forces (which, with the help of human-piloted sentinels, captures more heroes to detain in their super prison). Over time both sides gain and lose allies but it does eventually reach a climax with probably over 100 different superhumans fighting in full view of the public in a final battle that brings an end to the war, with one side conceding defeat.  
The comics involve multiple arcs, including Spiderman, the X-Men, X-Factor, Fantastic Four, She-Hulk, The Punisher, Daredevil, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, basically every superhuman in the Marvel universe that lives on earth, even Howard the Duck; I think the Inhumans aren't affected.",4i35uf

The Batman origin story sequence compares with Black Zero, showing that this is something as traumatic to Batman as his parents' murder. And sets up for the end of the titular BvS fight. I wonder just how many people think the origin bit was unnecessary but then don't think the the truce makes any sense. 

Spider-Man is pretty much thrown into CW. Like blatantly the movie stops so Tony can pick him up from Queens and make meta-jokes about Aunt May.

I kind of like that Wonder Woman just shows up. She's just there, going along with her own agenda before being swept up in the battle with Doomsday. I mean there's always that question in these cinematic movies about where characters are when world ending events are going down. Why didn't so-and-so help?

Peter out of the costume did EXCELLENT at the sort of shifty and nervous of people, especially Aunt May, finding out about his powers.  I think he played that aspect spot on.  Like, perfectly.  Mannerisms, speak patterns, body language.  It was perfect.

Also, and I genuinely really liked Garfield as Spider-Man, but I thought his Peter was kind of contrived.  Sure, Tobey was a weird ""loner loser"" outsiders stereotype, but Peter Parker was like skateboarding in the hallways of school and shit that felt, to me, a bit contrived.  Like a studio exec called up the screen writer and asked ""hey what did Dreamcast-era, edgy, cool kids really like to do?  Skateboard? Perfect, throw it in there!""  In contrast, I really liked how this Peter was dumpster diving for old tech he thought was cool and he could use to repair and modify.  It didn't come across as super hispter-y, just kind of like a thing a kinda-nerdy kid in 2016 might do — take home old Apple IIs and DVD players he finds on the curb. 

His in-suite Spider-Man was AMAZING.  He talked way too much.  He was wayyy too young and juvenile.  It was perfect.  Like exactly what I would expect from silver screen spidey, if I had no preconceived notions of how a movie Spider-Man should be or has been.

None of this is a knock on Garfield.  I really liked those two movies and I thought he did a pretty good job with it.  I just think this version was better.  It's like my iPhone 6s.  I really loved my old iPhone 4, but this is even better. 

Just my two cents, you are certainly entitled to your own opinion, as you have.  Cheers!",4i35uf

d2vfs6w,"Ok, then?",4i35uf
d2vjmp6,I just don't think it works as well as an older Spider-man would,4i35uf
d2w48ai,"Oh you're just freaking nuts. The first one *maybe* is close to being on par with ASM1&2's writing, but literally everything else, the ASM2 series does better, **especially** the acting, which was downright terrible in the Tobey Maguire movies. The writing in 2 was also terrible, with just really stupid lines everywhere, and really corny situations. Even Dock Ock, while presented alright for the most part, had some pretty terrible scenes in a couple places. 

The best argument I've seen against the ASM movies is the direction they took with their villains. Literally everything else is practically perfect. Andrew nails Spider-man's sarcastic personality whereas Tobey didn't even feel like Spider-man at all, and Tobey's Peter is just a 1950's caricature of what a nerd should be, whereas Andrew actually portrays a realistic modern day nerd/outcast. The chemistry between Peter and Gwen is about 1000x better than Peter and MJ in the older ones as well.

The ""cheese"" in the Raimi movies is not a good thing. At all. That kind of thing can be done great, but Raimi didn't even remotely come close to that. Spider-man 3 is just the perfect example of what's leftover when you toss story out the window in Raimi's Spider-man movies. The cheese is more apparent in that movie because there's not much else there, but that exact same level of cheese exists in all 3 movies. And it's terrible. 

Tom Holland is definitely a heck of a lot closer to Garfield's style, just... not as good. It's probably mostly the age factor, but he's just not as good of an actor either. Maybe over time he will get better, or maybe with better material to work with, but for now it's got me definitely missing Garfield. ",4i35uf

d2xfgmc,"I disagree, the plan could've gone wrong several times.

Framing Bucky caused a 'shoot on sight' order to be put on him. How did Zemo know Bucky wouldn't get killed by the cops at any point? Hell even T'challa came close to killing him. Even if he survived, he could've been taken in by Cap, or Iron Man, or someone else, and NOT gone to the specific prison Martin Freeman was in.

Speaking of the prison, it was rather difficult to believe that NO ONE checked the psychologist that was coming in. They had a crazy setup to contain Bucky with state of the art security but you don't even check Zemo? It's not like he went to any effort to disguise himself either, he literally just killed the other guy and came.

Then there's the business in Siberia. His entire, multilayer plan was to get there to extract a single video clip to show to Iron Man...which is rather trite if you think about it, but whatever. To have it work he needed to get Iron Man there, but there were so many instances where that could have gone wrong. Any of the Avengers might have been critically hurt during the airport battle, or taken into custody, and whatnot. Zemo himself might've been taken out if the whole Avengers decided to show up and not give him a chance to talk. It seems a complete miracle that his plan worked out the way it did, because no amount of planning could possibly have guaranteed him that outcome. 

And that's the other problem with his character...he seemed too capable. He seemed to know everything about the Avengers, their personal lives included, and also about Hydra and the Winter Soldier program, even enough to know that Bucky killed Howard Stark. I know he was a spy, but knowing THAT MUCH when he wasn't even associated with the Avengers is quite difficult to grasp. He was then able to single-handedly pull of the entire convoluted plan, hopping around all over the world and never getting caught, and was successful. That is some Batman-level shit right there.

It's not your fault.

I was just pissed at anyone on Tony's side most of the movie. And Vision should've fucking known better.

These peeps are sent to a mental institute instead. So no, Bucky can't be held responsible. He wasn't even in control of his actions.

You can't have a group of vigilantes running around exercising their power uncontrolled with no accountability! And you're telling me that Captain America, a trained SOLDIER has problems taking orders from a governing body? Guess what happens if you allow a team to make the decisions? You end up being wrong. People die. Take the events in the movie for example. What if you didn't personally know Bucky? The evidence was surmounting. You would have ended him.

Tony's guilt has been building since the first Iron Man and especially capitalized in Age of Ultron because HE (and Banner, but Tony convinced him) was directly responsible for creating Ultron and what happened in Sokovia. Cap tried to stop him, and it's been tense since then. 

To say Steve doesn't care about the ""little guy"" is a bit unfair, since the majority of the movie is about him helping someone being framed for crimes they didn't commit. He could have chalked up Bucky as an acceptable loss,but didn't. He could have killed Tony, but didn't. I don't think Tony would have stayed his hand any longer after he said  ""final warning"". ",4i35uf
d2y25ak,"> He sees the names, the faces of the peoples' lives who were lost as a direct result of **their** actions.

Emphasis mine, because I think that's the huge problem with your argument.

Cap isn't responsible. He didn't create Ultron, and he never would have agreed to Ultron being created. Sokovia was not his fault at all. None of the events have been his fault. Red Skull, NYC invasion, Hydra in D.C., Sokovia... none of those events were caused by things he did. Cap has very little to feel guilty for. He saw those crises building, and he responded. He did everything he could to save everyone he could, and he can rest easy knowing that his actions helped save billions of lives each time.

Stark can't say the same. Ultron was entirely his fault. Sokovia was *his* fault (not *their* fault, unless that ""their"" is only referring to Stark and Banner and not the rest of the team). Without some of his actions, a number of events that resulted in ""collateral damage"" never would have happened in the first place. Saving billions of lives isn't so comforting when you're the one that put those lives in danger to begin with.

That's why they differ on what losses are ""acceptable."" It's not because Cap doesn't care about those lives, or doesn't ""see"" them or that he doesn't wish they could have saved everyone, but when he's not responsible for it, he's still able to see the bigger picture when it's all over, and he doesn't really have things to atone for. 

That's also why the bomb blast at the beginning of Civil War troubled him more than any of the other events- fewer people died, but he knows it was partly because he froze for a moment over Bucky's name being mentioned. He had reason to feel some guilt over that.",4i35uf
d30luxd,"> Steve doesn't see that anymore, because to him, those were acceptable losses. In the end, you saved more than you lost so you did good, you got the job done. Bad guys lost, Good guys won.

d305vnv,"The fact that Tony and Steve have essentially swapped philosophies is my favorite part of this giant saga. 

Steve went from trusting the government with absolute blind faith to only trusting his whole moral compass. And Tony went from giving a giant middle finger to the government trying to requisition his suits to learning he couldn't trust his judgment fully.

d2uub2z,"> Great point. But Tony made the arc tech on that level to provide clean sustainable energy to NYC. It's not like he contemplated a god showing up and using it to open a portal to the Chithauri. He created Ultron to prevent another Chithauri like invasion since he saw the full extent of their forces (flashbacks in Iron Man 3 and his aggressive PTSD). I don't think he figured it would go sentient. And he made the tech for the ships for SHIELD, not Hydra. Again, he didn't know that Hydra had thoroughly infiltrated SHIELD. He even talks about how he shut down his weapons division because he didn't want to be a merchant of death. Stark makes things to benefit humanity, but for the most part, it's corrupted by situations no one would contemplate happening. Cap doesn't just feel bad about the people he couldn't save, he also ignores the fact that his actions put people in harm's way.

I'm not saying Tony's a bad guy or that he has bad intentions, but you know what Uncle Ben says, and with that much power Tony's way too irresponsible. Another example is from Iron Man 2 when Tony gets into a drunk, mechanized brawl with Rhodes, who ends up taking his armor, giving it to the military, who then lends it out to Hammer as models for his drones. Stark's dealings with SHIELD and the government in general just reinforce Cap's point that a government body can't be trusted to oversee people like them.

>Stark's on a deadline. Cap is too. Stark repeatedly asks him to stand down and goes so far as to beg him to come with.

Come on, Stark had 12 hours, Cap asks for a chance to explain (and how long would that really take?) and Stark has Spidey web him up.

>That's fair, but as I said to someone else, that's a super brief and easily missed set up to one of the biggest reveals in this film.

Honestly I think a lot of this was predictable given the fact that in Iron Man 2 and Winter Soldier it's revealed that a) Hydra assassinated SHIELD people who get in the way and that b) The Winter Soldier was a notorious Hydra assassin. and c) Howard Stark was a founding member of shield.

>I think I actually just dislike this about the way he's written. If he's always so damn righteous, then what's the point of anyone disagreeing with him?

I dislike Superman for the same reasons, except he's basically a God, bullets bounce off of him and his only real weakness is an incredibly rare substance. Cap has the super serum (although even before that he was courageous), but he's still basically a man at peak physical fitness. War can make ordinarily good people do horrible things, and even though Superman gets into fights, he's not a soldier and he doesn't deal with those realities, while Steve Rogers does. So while Superman can afford to be righteous because he's literally indestructible, Cap does the right thing in spite of being mortal. That's why he's the leader of the Avengers.

>And lest we forget, how many soldiers who were not in any way evil did he severely injure to save Bucky?

If someone's shooting at you, does it matter whether they're evil or not? Cap's a soldier, and he was fighting to protect his innocent friend. It's sad that otherwise good people are killed and maimed in unjust wars, but that's the nature of it.

>I think his inability to see the nuance is his great failing and I loved that the movie started to go there, but I wish they'd committed to it.

Ultimately good governance requires both individual accountability as well as group discussion and decision making. Cap isn't always gonna be right.

The better option would have been to sign the sokovia accords with the addendum that no Avenger engages in a mission they don't personally agree with (while similarly not invading sovereign soil without UN approval = accept limitations). Which is what BW was talking about by keeping 1 hand on the wheel. But Cap didn't want to discuss. Because it's Cap and his ability to be a soldier or nothing.

Also, Vision knocked the control tower down to block Rogers and WS from getting to the jet to get away. If he were going for the kill, he would have hit them directly.

Had Sam not dodged Vision's blast, he would have lost power and fallen to the ground, just like Rhoady did, so you have me there. Although Stark didn't tell him to kill Sam, just knock him out of the sky so he could tail them.

In civil war, Stark knows there is Bucky and there is TWS,a clear divide between the two. And since there is a divide, and since cap, Stark, and everyone is aware if that, Stark trying to kill Bucky when he sees that TWS killed his family is, well, not as a believable motive",4i35uf

We don't always need character deaths to get character development though. The events in Civil War have altered character relationships in MCU permanently e.g. Tony vs. Falcon, Hawkeye vs. Tony

With BvS, I was taken out of the movie constantly because I had to ""put the pieces"" together. That's just a chore for most moviegoers, and it's not what most people are looking for in a movie. 

And to your point about Batman, they obviously fear him. Superman looks at him with disgust for his actions. Like I said before, there's no moment where Superman seems to wish people loved him like they do Batman apparently *because most people seem to love him anyway*. There's an entire montage dedicated to showing how people goddamn worship him. Why would he want what Batman has, which is a vigilante status covered by a mask? 

Anyway, I'm not desperate to criticize, here. Enough people have lambasted BvS for good and bad reasons, and my mind has been made up since I watched the film. If it's a film you love, great. But I'll debate for days on topics like this.  ",4i35uf

I mean, I understand that there's a thing called artistic liberties when making movies but also I don't know why they would stray so far from the source material and then almost rub it in people's faces by commenting on it several times about how hot and young she looks. 

In terms of the Bucky thing, I'm not trying to deny what happened to him. I am fully aware that he was tortured, brainwashed, and framed. All I'm saying is that they didn't really show us that much of it. Maybe if they showed us some turmoil then I would feel bad for him but you can't just say ""feel bad for this guy, he went through some bad stuff off screen"" and expect everyone to develop an emotional connection. All they had to do was add another scene or two that made us gain his sympathy and I think it would have went a long way. Instead, it seemed like they were counting on the audience making that connection from previous films but those were so long ago and I didn't even really like Cap 1 that much anyways.

Tony Stark is for the Accords and is willing to sign away his freedom to choose when to act.

It is a shame how much potential it had to really go all the way, but I think that doing so would be betraying the core of who cap and iron man really are. Honestly, unless someone seriously fcked up on ACCIDENT in this movie, no one would really die. The characters marvel has built up for us are not the type who'd be willing to kill their friends. Hell, it took seeing his parents get brutally murdered right in front of him, to make tony stark realistically go all out against cap.

Superman ""died"" in BvS but for sure theyre bringing him back.  Still they did something different and while we're sure he's coming back we're asking how and what circumstances is his Resurrection going to be./ 

In marvel's movies I've grown accustomed to assuming there is NO risk at stake for pur heroes. Iron Patriot gets shot down from the sky and 10 minutes later he's already on his way to walking again. Granted he's being helped by advance technology, people who get ACL injures take longer than a few days to be able to walk again.      

Loki ""dies"" in Thor 2 and at the end he's ruler of fucking Asgard all of a sudden. Caulson dies and is fucking revived with no explanation at all for a tv series. That tree looking motherfucker dies in GotG and then he's already reborn at the end of the movie.  

There's no risk or consequences AT ALL in these movies. This is what  bothers me the most with Marvel. Something bad happens in the movie and I go ""ehh...they'll figure it out."" Even Civil War's ending is such a cop out. ""We're not friends but just use this burner phone in Avengers 3.5 and we'll be friends again by the first hour of the movie.

Fuck  at least not show War Machine already on the road to recovery. Make people ask if he'll still be able to fight or will be a wheel chair support character because of the events of Civil War. Or maybe not include that burner phone in the end. Just have Capt go ""we'll do our thing and you do yours. Maybe one day our path will meet again and let's see how it goes.

He also told him to stay on the edge of the battle, and just web up anyone like they had planned.

As for the workarounds, Marvel wanted a teenage Spider-Man for their universe. So having be a hero for years wouldn't really work. I think your second scenario would have been the best choice, but I can understand Marvel wanting to have Spider-Man in a battle after finally getting the rights to use the character after years and years.

The movie also established (as well as in Iron Man 2) that Stark has never fully processed the grief of his parents' loss and he still has severe lingering issues that were never resolved. He was freaking out when Coulson died (a guy he barely knew). He takes loss HARD.

Also, you assume that Stark has wrestled with news like this ... when the hell else would he deal with news like this?

Steve is denying Tony justice for his parents' murder, and has been for a long time. One of his best friends has known and actively denied him the ability to get justice for an old wound, one that has been shown in this movie and others to have never been given closure. THAT's what sets Tony off.

However,  that you're willing to reply to me tells me you actually have potential to make a transition.

When writing, if you want to be taken seriously you need to approach the topic without bias and with an open mind.

I could say why I thought Batman v Superman (as an example) was an average film and explain what worked for me, what didn't work, and rest my case like that, or I could call it out as ""omfg the worst 2.5 hours of my life what is this shit when I hated this, that, and the other thing about the film wtf do people watch this shit, downvote me for being different idgaf it was only 3/10"" and you invite a senseless downvote brigade because it reads like a thoughtless post.

d3oylet,"A) ""call it cap"" is after Tony has already tried being the chessmaster and failed miserably. Yet everyone still listened to him while he was a giant bubmbling idiot.

B) ""I'm not the leader, he is"" is yet again after Tony was doing things *his* way (while other members of the avengers went along with it) and had gotten into a giant shit show of a mess

We can disagree, but at least I don't use two lines out of context to try and make a crap point.

List you when Tony ""made plans"":

1. The creation of Ultron with mysterious otherworldly magic that went horribly wrong

2. Veronica drops Hulk through the middle of a building in whatever shit third world country they were in.

3. Tony Stark and Nick Fury literally create the idea of public heroes with ""the Avenger initiative""

4. Pre-shows, stark is a souless weapons mogul who helps arm and motivate super-villians

5. Stark creates Vision completely unilaterally, again harnessing otherworldly mystical powers that he knows jack shit about

6. Stark is the driving force behind getting other Avengers to sign the Sokovia Accords

7. Stark sides with the government in keeping Scarlet Witch in seclusion, under lockdown. A superhero he helped to piss off, by selling bombs to the people who killed her family.

8. How did ultron almost take over the world? Oh, that's right. Tony had automated suits made to be stationed all over the globe. When did he tell Cap about that? Right after his unilaterally created super monster Ultron started using them to kill people.

9. He outs Spiderman, so him and his government cronies can hunt down other superheroes. Let's say that again, he used his tech to spy on, and expose a superhuman to pressure him (and then brainwash him) into fighting his own kind.

10. The same guy who lipped off at a Senate hearing about how they couldn't control him/Iron Man, now takes his marching order from them. He's gone rogue and done things his own way for 3 full movies now, usually with disastrous results that he is incapable of fixing by himself. Hence, why Cap should be the person who everyone listens to. Yet somehow, he manages to get people to follow him and his shit ideas (Banner, S.H.I.E.L.D., Rhodes, Vision) every fucking time. It is pedantic and stupid.

And that was one person's opinion. The German police had been given orders to shoot on sight since Bucky was believed to be a dangerous terrorist. Steve could have easily deflated the situation and taken Bucky in himself instead of fighting the police instead. And when it was explicitly promised that Bucky would be given a trial Steve still refused to sign the Accords. It's not that he disagreed with them either - just that they needed safety clauses - it's that he had other priorities. So you can't tell me Steve's thoughts in this film lay with ""the little guy"" he usually protects. Hell, even Chris Evans himself says Steve is acting selfishly in this film.

After that you can only speculate as to what would have happened if the Avengers had just saved NY and stopped there, but we know Hydra was still dicking around with their world domination thing and we know because of Winter Soldier that they would have had the tech and power to launch them much, much closer to their goal.

Batman, up to this point had only dehumanized Superman and then he has a very human moment where Superman has accepted death and all he wants now is his mother's safety.

Tony has PTSD and is struggling with being responsible, directly and indirectly, for many deaths. Not only that but the Avengers were already split. One of his closet friends decided to be an outlaw and run to help a known terrorist and murderer, who had *no evidence* at the time to point to him being innocent.

Couple this with the fact that by the time he gets to the point of fucking 2v1 he has undergone more trauma.

* Accords did not work out like planned, everyone he captured is super pissed and kept in shitty conditions

* His best friend is crippled 

* He has been running on fumes/lack of sleep while traveling the world and fighting constantly

* Has been getting his ass kicked several times in and out of his armor.

* Bucky looked him in the eyes and tried to shoot him, only his watch saved him

All of these continue to stack up, and *still* Tony shows up there and tries to work together. Finally he is confronted with the actual video of his parents dying. While he had no special love for his father (regret how things turned out) his mother was a huge influence. Now he has to watch as she is choked to death by the man standing next to him.

On his other side? A close friend, whom they have risked their lives for each other, who knew. Cap knew the whole time and *never* told Tony, instead protecting Bucky.

It's not like the UN would do any better controlling Wanda or Vision.

The only solution I could see is an appointed mini-court that the Avengers discuss with. This court could provide some small degree of influence in decision-making and ""next time try to X"", but the power has to be held by the Avengers. It's better than having no communication at all.

In contrast, Stark has grown up in modern times and up until Iron Man actually sold weapons to get rich without realizing the consequences. To him each individual lost is too many because of the modern perspective of it and the ""otherness"" of modern warfare.

Prevent all innocent lives from being lost? Impossible. Being kept in check? By who? People, like Cap said, that have agendas?

The Avengers are not morally corrupt, and will put their lives on the line for innocent people no matter the scenario, so their decisions on where to go and who to fight, are the typically the best decisions.

Cap is a soldier, he understands casualties happen, and you can't dwell on them because if you do then...well it will eat you alive. Iron Man is just that, he's a man, he's not a soldier, he was never meant for war, and you can see it with how he responds to the stress of certain situations.

d2vc0uz,">I'm not saying Tony's a bad guy or that he has bad intentions, but you know what Uncle Ben says, and with that much power Tony's way too irresponsible. Another example is from Iron Man 2 when Tony gets into a drunk, mechanized brawl with Rhodes, who ends up taking his armor, giving it to the military, who then lends it out to Hammer as models for his drones. Stark's dealings with SHIELD and the government in general just reinforce Cap's point that a government body can't be trusted to oversee people like them.

It isn't like it's just America that wants the oversight. It's 115 countries calling for accountability. So Cap has decided that he knows better and his actions should be without question. That's shockingly arrogant. And Cap ends up destroying a lot of property and his actions lead to the deaths of many in TWS. The entire Hydra thing happened on his watch, after all. 

>Come on, Stark had 12 hours, Cap asks for a chance to explain (and how long would that really take?) and Stark has Spidey web him up.

And Cap could've explained on the way. How hard would that be? Stark can't risk that Cap or Bucky will run. Which they do. 

>Honestly I think a lot of this was predictable given the fact that in Iron Man 2 and Winter Soldier it's revealed that a) Hydra assassinated SHIELD people who get in the way and that b) The Winter Soldier was a notorious Hydra assassin. and c) Howard Stark was a founding member of shield.

Yeah, makes sense. I just wish there was more setup in this film. 

>I dislike Superman for the same reasons, except he's basically a God, bullets bounce off of him and his only real weakness is an incredibly rare substance. Cap has the super serum (although even before that he was courageous), but he's still basically a man at peak physical fitness. War can make ordinarily good people do horrible things, and even though Superman gets into fights, he's not a soldier and he doesn't deal with those realities, while Steve Rogers does. So while Superman can afford to be righteous because he's literally indestructible, Cap does the right thing in spite of being mortal. That's why he's the leader of the Avengers.

I think he's also the leader because he's a literal Captain and out ranks everyone else. Maybe not Rhodes. But Stark routinely tries to do the right thing as well. Again, this is a writing issue, but the plot just treats Cap as incorruptible, but I think it would've have been better if they'd leaned in to Cap being so blindly loyal and thinking he's right that he refuses to see the damage he's causing. Like, he's doing good, but at what cost? At what point is his mission still the greater good? 

>If someone's shooting at you, does it matter whether they're evil or not? Cap's a soldier, and he was fighting to protect his innocent friend. It's sad that otherwise good people are killed and maimed in unjust wars, but that's the nature of it.

Well they know what's going on. Cap has several warnings from Wilson about then coming to get Bucky out. But he decides to hash things out in a closed space with limited exits. 

>I think he understands that sometimes killing is inevitable, sometimes you don't have a choice, and sometimes it's necessary for the greater good.

And that's well and good, but he refuses to be held accountable when someone else says he may have been wrong. He feels morally superior. They go into this more in the comics, where Caps arrogance blinds him to the damage he does. I just wish they done it more here. This is a guy leading a vigilante security force to police the world.

I would have scrapped Doomsday because they're going to do Justice League they no longer have the opportunity to do the ""Death of Superman"" because they just wasted it and he's coming back so any major moment is lost for the future.

Same with Wonder Woman I mean she was good and all but she didn't need to be there and when Batman asks if she was with Superman I was so confused, I was sitting there like ""But you emailed HER!"" 

And then the videotapes of the Justice League...just no. I would have set it up throughout so there was some YouTube/their version of YouTube if it's copyrighted of the Justice League members. Like Aquaman saving people from a capsized boat or the flash running through the city when Superman was fighitng Zod and then he later sought out Bruce because he saw him and then dream sequence. Maybe Wonder Woman in a video or some history story of the island and how they've found a floating island or something that scientists are trying to unlock mystery to.

d2v3thq,"Tony was wrong about siding with the UN. His being wrong about Bucky was tangential to that, as his issue there was more about revenge for his parents rather than ""limiting the power of the Avengers"". 

A moral monarchy? I'm not familiar with that phrase in this context, so I'm not sure what you're saying. 

What I am suggesting, what the movie clearly demonstrates, is that taking away the decision to choose what's right vs wrong and putting it into the hands of a committee is the wrong thing to do. Yes, even in a democracy. Because that's how shit committees are at figuring this stuff out, at figuring out what the right thing to do is, at ensuring that people are doing the right thing. In the movie, the example was the persecution of an innocent man over a crime he did not do, whereas in real life we have multitudes of examples - Wars fought for illegitimate reasons. The War on Drugs. Catastrophic Anthropomorphic Climate Change. Widespread financial fraud. Drone wars. Mass surveillance. The way we govern ourselves *doesn't work* precisely because we've shifted responsibility away from ourselves, away from the individual, to special interests, where there is no accountability, and no incentive to change or to admit mistakes. 



",4i35uf
d2v45iz,"At no point in the movie does Captain America display any hatred to Iron Man or the others.  Stark hates on Bucky, but because Bucky was directly responsible for the death of Stark's parents. If I'm wrong, please let me know exactly when the two expressed hatred. They fought, but that's because one side had to go somewhere, and the other side's job was to stop it. They weren't fighting over feelings.

Please tell me exactly where in the movie did Captain America be pushed around by using his friends, or by manipulating his emotions. 

Please also tell me exactly who died in the movie because Captain America acted like a ""stubborn child""? Who died because of a direct result of Captain America, and not because of some bad third party actor? 

Because I saw the movie, and I remember the movie, but I don't remember anything that would support your claims. Granted, I was pretty fucking baked.

There is no negotiation, no middle ground in deciding where responsibility needs to lay. It's either with the Avengers, or with some committee. You seem to be forgetting that the Avengers are superheroes. Who fight supervillains. And supervillains don't wait around for authorization from some committee before they act. By conceding to the bureaucracy, Captain America would necessarily be giving up responsibility for any events while the bureaucracy spun its wheels. That is not a compromise that he is willing to make, because that's ultimately siding with the mistaken, foolish belief that morality and ethics are best governed by committee.

Stark remarked in the movie that he had never been able to create an AI and that the possible permutations or some shit were so complicated it would likely take a ridiculous amount of computing to get the right combination.  Yet the minute they turn their backs the computer hits the right combination.  Did Stark really make Ultron or did Thanos take advantage of the situation and create Ultrons program?  As a mmber of a vastly more advanced race Thanos would have a much easier time creating something like that than Stark.  Ultrons boast about not having strings is irony.  He does have strings and Thanos is pulling them to get the infinity stone. 

Regarding Vision, His accidentally shooting Rhodes out of the sky allows Capt America to get away and further widens the gap between the members of the Avengers.  Thanos knows the stones probably better than anyone, if the stones can be used to influence their owners then Thanos would know how to do it.

It felt hollow to me because there were no real stakes, and it's even mention several times *during the fight* that they're pulling their punches. It doesn't have any weight to it. It feels more like a heated discussion between friends than a real fight. Like the real life equivalent of getting into a heated discussion with your friends about whether or not a movie was good. You may be shouting at each other, but at the end you know you're just going to say 'Agree to disagree' and go back to playing Halo. But this was a super hero movie, so instead of yelling they were punching each other.

The end was much better, because for the first time in the movie, lines were drawn. It was no longer 'We have a personal disagreement' but rather 'If you come near me, I will end you'. Which leads to a great moment in which, for a split second, you forget you're watching a Disney movie and think 'Oh shit, I'm about to watch someone get decapitated!' That weight only comes from the fact that you know all bets are off between their friendship.

Also, while on the topic, the whole weight of everything during the airport scene really made the Vision hitting War Machine bit kind of...off. Like I was expecting Vision to say at any moment,""Sorry for almost murdering the wrong friend, Tony."" Especially when you have Falcon apologizing to Tony...who told Vision to shoot him out of the sky.

It would make sense for these people who've fought side by side, been friends for years, placed massive amounts of trust and such to not suddenly want to kill each other over the sorts of circumstances the airport set up. There's no real reason at that point for them want to kill or seriously injure each other (Part of why Sam rushes to help Rhodes when he sees he got hurt) 

It's part of why the end fight worked so well for me; the contrast between wanting to stop, and wanting to kill. ",4i35uf

d2ve7yc,"I bought the Sarkovia accords, but I didn't buy the public resentment of The Avengers.

Zemo's plan didn't really work without T'Chaka dying or Vision shooting down War Machine, which were both flukes.

The entire airport scene wasn't necessary. Hawkeye was able to fly in Ant-Man and Scarlet Witch from Avengers HQ, yet they have to steal a quinjet from the airport? The only reason for that was for them to face off (which justifies the name Civil War).

The fight was also completely avoidable by them talking it out. Cap could have let them take in Bucky under conditions until he cleared his name, Tony's smarter than to fall for the frame job, and he also should have already known Bucky killed his parents, since he copies the SHIELD archives in Avengers.

It was entertaining, so I'm willing to roll with it, but the plot was not up to Winter Soldier levels. Definitely better than both Avengers movies, though.",4i35uf

d2wbp5c,I totally missed it I guess. That does make more sense. I guess the whole thing is a bit tricky from a story telling perspective.

Movies that are made for kids then have the option to add in subtle jokes for the adult viewers, but it doesn't stop the fact that it was made for kids. 

We pretty much agree. I just found it weird that you drew the line at GotG. lol",4i35uf
d2xc0vl,"> What about that story needed a death to make it more powerful? What's your argument for these films suffering simply because no one died? Because, in this film, they lost.

No, as I said it takes a lot away from the film if there is plot armor stronger than Supermans and Batmans.

here this guy explains better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q6X8oHh7wA

> Yet, you're ignoring all of this. Brushing aside every ounce of story and nuance, and simply arguing but no one died so it's bullshit.

Now you are just making shit up, I just said there was never a threat of anyone dying, no one had to die, but they failed to sell me on Warmachines danger too.

Cap: Yes. ",4i35uf
d2vsd5u,"I felt him killing the 5 winter soldiers was  a complete afterthought. Also, he could have accomplished his goal by just sent the information that he acquired about the Starks' murder to directly Tony.  Also it bugs me completely that this guy got to the Winter Soldier's cell with no one knowing that this wasn't the person they hired.  ",4i35uf
d2vurx2,Why is he looking for that specific information ? He already knows what he is looking for. ,4i35uf
d2vsead,"Yup. Though his own government did kind of waste him on PR at first, he didn't even live through the Cold War or Vietnam, so bad guys were more black and white to him, but since awaking in modern day, he's seen an organization he wanted to trust exposed as corrupt and been abused by it. Then his friend/ally Tony creates AI that almost destroys the world. Now the same guy is telling him they can't be trusted so someone needs to be in control of them. Cap's like, ""I followed SHIELD and they had me on missions serving Hydra."" Similarly, Natasha realizing in WS that she killed people because Hydra wanted it. Really makes you doubt any authority but your own. 

And Tony's talk about being able to change the document and not really being restricted sounds a lot like appeasement, which Cap knows about. ""Just go along with it and it'll work out. Yeah it sucks, but it's less sucky that them forcing us to do it."" Cap wasn't surprised that Bucky wasn't getting a lawyer. He's already seeing that their own consciences and desires are irrelevant if their bosses say otherwise. There's a fine line between laws/regulation and fascism/control.",4i35uf
d2xqeec,"You're making leaps that weren't there. I agree with you, slippery slope and all that. But at the time, the accords were strctly talking about turning the Avengers into a government run agency (attack dog)

Tony totally COULD have brought up the slippery slope argument, but we didn't see it. So Peter's involvement becomes a little more forced, and his involvement was already pretty forced to begin with. 

I was disappointed that they didn't attempt to even bring up the point of ""what about all the non-avengers super heroes?"" But overall, I wish they had stuck to the registration act, instead of altering it to the accords. I feel it weakened the movie/story. ",4i35uf

My understanding of MCU Iron Man is that he's fatally compulsive no matter how much he matures, and even when he has time to cool down he is very passionate. He had also grown to really regret his relationship with his father, which proves essential to the story. And Captain America, well he would die for Bucky, he might as well be the little arc reactor keeping his heart from being shredded up.

d2wr2wz,"The fallen empires line talks about ""..crumbles from within.."" so they should've realized they're talking about infighting, or maybe they took it as in general and not for them but Black Panther obviously understood it which leaves the question again of why he didn't stop them once he had Zemo dead to rights , or why he didn't try to stop them from fighting and go after him together . 

I know Tony didn't want to kill Bucky, when he lasers off his arm it makes it clear that at any moment he could have killed both of them, & he was releasing his frustrations etc BUT what I don't get is if He didn't want to kill Bucky and just wanted to bring him in and Cap didn't kill stark , why did we get that awkward love letter ending instead of something else, it just left a bad taste in my mouth ",4i35uf

The whole beauty of Tony Stark as a character is that he's fundamentally human. Though he is a superhero as well, he very much struggles in balancing personal feelings and his moral code. When he saw that video of Bucky killing his parents, he couldn't restrain himself. What would you have done? 

Stark did what he did because he's human. He idolized his father and loved his mother. When he saw that Cap's friend had murdered them in cold blood, he wanted him dead.

I thought for sure they were setting up Spider-Man to eventually jump ship to Cap's side, but as it was, I thought it served as a great example of Stark being a little self-seeking in recruiting Peter to his side even though Peter's own motivation seemed more aligned with Cap's vision.",4i35uf

d2vxqey,"I get what you're saying. I thought you were saying he was 'weak' from a story standpoint, not a character one. 

I think making the Pym version Ultron would have been problematic because it would have required giving Pym the backstory + movies + whatever. Because these movies have been building on each other, it made cinematic sense to have it be Tony, because he's the guy who basically makes robotic weapons anyway, and his character has been building to this - first, it's an armored suit, then it's a fleet of semi-automated suits; next stage is automated sentry machines. It's a natural extension of what came before; Tony thinking he can protect the world if he can just build the right machines (it's what he's best at after all).

So while there could be plenty of scientists in the cinematic Marvel universe with the smarts to build Ultron, it works elegantly as a product of Stark's personal character arc in the cinematic universe.",4i35uf

Also, the collateral damage caused in Avengers and Winter soldier shouldn't even be used as a ""hey you fucked up"" Like, New York was aliens invading earth, and the second one was Hydra corrupting Shield.

d2zcf2n,"People bitch about that scene now. Never mind if you didn't establish Thomas Wayne's last word as being ""Martha."" Like at least now, the way the movie is put together, you can link Batman's attempt to kill Superman with Bruce watching his parents' die. Without that scene, it really would just look like, ""Oh our mothers have the same name."" 

And it juxtaposes with Black Zero, like I said. Batman has seen a lot of horrible shit. A lot of horrible shit happens in almost any given Batman movie. That's the nature of it. But its all overshadowed by that one moment in his childhood.

So Snyder takes that moment and sets it next to Black Zero. Both scenes end with orphans, with Bruce being pushed into darkness. Its significant because its not just pushing him into normal Batman shenanigans, but into the morally bankrupt territory that people find so objectionable, that people take issue with. They think the character is ruined. 

Since this is a Civil War thread, I'd like to point out that THAT is high stakes. As well done as the fight between Tony and Cap was, as ""divided"" as the Avengers seen, it won't take much for it to be business as usual in the next go round. Tony has already had enough of Ross's oversight, Cap has already told Tony to call him when he needs him. 

But Batman? Batman has a long road to recovery, to making amends for what he had done and tried to do. 

Just my two cents. 

Anyway. I find it interesting that people want the movie to have to stand on its own (which is a common criticism leveled at the Knightmare and Flash sequence), but then criticize the movie for including something that past Batman movies have done. Especially when it has an explicit purpose.

I think I’ve done my dash with that sort of film. It was good to do it and try it out, but to be honest, it’s not the sort of film I seek out and really am excited by.

To their credit, that's been pointed out by a few characters. He even said himself that he wasn't sure who he was without a war to fight.

The fact that Bucky and Bruce Banner voluntarily exclude themselves from society shows that they understand the risks...but what happens when a superhero doesn't? What happens when Hulk can't control his rage and destroys a city block? Captain America is willing to take that risk on the assumption that the good in human nature will prevail, and entrusts in his and his Avenger's abilities to stop anything bad from happening if things do go south.

That's shockingly arrogant. And Cap ends up destroying a lot of property and his actions lead to the deaths of many in TWS. The entire Hydra thing happened on his watch, after all.

Maybe it's just because I grew up with a parent who worked at the UN, but the international community is a joke. 117 countries could call for anything and it wouldn't make it inherently right or wrong. Cap was right when he said Agendas change. Depending on something like the UN to deploy the avengers in a timely and righteous manner is naive. 

>So Cap has decided that he knows better and his actions should be without question. That's shockingly arrogant.

It would be if this weren't a comic book movie and Cap weren't a paragon of virtue.

>And Cap ends up destroying a lot of property and his actions lead to the deaths of many in TWS. The entire Hydra thing happened on his watch, after all.

Hydra had infiltrated SHIELD for decades while he was frozen, there's no way you can blame that debacle on him. If anything he minimized the loss of life (remember how those ships were targeting MILLIONS of people?).

>And Cap could've explained on the way. How hard would that be? Stark can't risk that Cap or Bucky will run. Which they do.

You know what's always a lose-lose tactic in negotiation? Posing an ultimatum. That's what Tony did and that's why he got his ass kicked.

>Yeah, makes sense. I just wish there was more setup in this film.

Yeah I've talked about this with some friends who haven't seen all of the previous marvel movies and even though this one is a pretty good standalone, there are so many things you miss if you haven't seen the everything else.

>I think he's also the leader because he's a literal Captain and out ranks everyone else. Maybe not Rhodes. But Stark routinely tries to do the right thing as well. Again, this is a writing issue, but the plot just treats Cap as incorruptible, 

He *is* incorruptible. I even remember reading an interview with RDJ where he was like (and i'm paraphrasing) ""Tony has to lead this team, then we talked and realized that Captain America's selflessness and purity make him a better fit"".

>but I think it would've have been better if they'd leaned in to Cap being so blindly loyal and thinking he's right that he refuses to see the damage he's causing. Like, he's doing good, but at what cost? At what point is his mission still the greater good?

Again, Cap is the guy who tries to stop a bad situation that's already in progress. Tony's the guy who's (more often than not) fixing a situation *he* created (Iron Man 1, Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3, and Avengers 2). When Cap does anything he's savings lives more lives than would otherwise be lost. If you really disagree with that then please, provide an example.


>Well they know what's going on. Cap has several warnings from Wilson about then coming to get Bucky out. But he decides to hash things out in a closed space with limited exits.

I thought we were talking about the first Captain America movie? Anyway, in Civil War he's protecting his (innocent) friend from being killed (that was their orders), and when Bucky almost tosses one of the policemen off the railing Cap catches him and says ""come on"". He's *all* about protecting innocents.


>And that's well and good, but he refuses to be held accountable when someone else says he may have been wrong.

d2wpl9o,"No, the original argument by yourself was that Tony didn't need any oversight to bring Spiderman into the fight. Which is just wrong. Even disregarding the Accords, what Tony did was highly illegal. Your argument that he can just throw away even the most basic laws because 'Spiderman has super powers and Tony is rich' is ridiculous. It only shows just how much Tony doesn't play by the rules, even his own.

Civil War is supposed to be a movie in which we're supposed to see that there are consequences to the super heroes' actions, and that's the whole point of the Accords. Then we see Tony Stark literally kidnap a 16 year old kid(And, yes, legally speaking taking a minor out of the country without permission from his legal guardian is kidnapping)with zero consequences or oversight. This is something that Tony could go to Federal Prison for.

I don't know how else to say this. His action of taking a 16 year old kid out of the country is not only illegal, but a federal crime. No amount of 'But he has super powers!' or 'But Tony's rich!' changes the fact that, legally, Tony Stark kidnapped a teenager in this movie. Which isn't just illegal, but hypocritical when the man doing the kidnapping is the one saying that The Avengers need to be held accountable for their extrajudicial behavior.",4i35uf

d2v6gm3,"Everyone that died after Cap had the chance to put down Winter Soldier in Cap 2 is on Cap. As I recall, his pal Bucky killed tons of shield agents and brought down a helicarrier. Also, eleven Wakandans died at the beginning of the field because mentioning a friend is a sure-fire way to drop Caps guard. No, Cap doesn't play by hate (except hatred of Nazis) but he is played by his emotion (emotionally attached to individuals rather than civilians). And if every decision needs to be up to the Avengers, where are they getting their intelligence?  Cap is a hell of a soldier but he needs the resources of governments to detect potential threats. So he wants the resources of an agency without any of the oversight. Cap only has his abilities because a group of people pooled resources for the common good. Again, I agree the accords were crappy at the starting off point but they presented the potential to actually solve problems rather than continue fighting a war in which civilians die while the civilians have no say or input because they're not superheroes. When your wife/mother/brother dies because C.A. has a vendetta against the red hand soldiers that dosent affect you at all,  that logic simply doesn't fly.     
     
Like it or not, all the avengers were damn-near destroyed by a random non-super villain because his family died at their hands and he had no other recourse. Instead of that, Cap could have negotiated, worked with a task force, gained the resources and oversight of the UN. But that might mean that cap doesn't get to be the bully-puncher for a whole week so he can't do that. He refuses to even come to the table because Tony is making hard choices and dealing with the public out-cry and Cap just wants to punch his way through everything. There are times in life when you have to choose between your friendships and the right thing to do. Had Cap negotiated and gotten his voice on a committee dealing with enhanced peoples, he could have pointed out that WS has no motive for bombing the accords meeting, and defended his civil right to a trial. But then Cap doesn't get to be judge and jury, so he'd rather pout and blow shit up instead.     
You want to pretend that it's okay for any single entity to have tons of power  and no oversight and they'll always be right and should never be brought to account for a hit that they break? (I don't see Cap volunteering to pay for the damages caused at the airport, sokovia, or NYC, so he's obviously OK with government protection then) that's your perspective.

Now Vision. Vision I feel really did make the mistake of shooting Rhodey himself because he was clearly aiming for Falcon who moved out of the way. He failed to consider that possibility. It widens the gap between the Avengers because that was what Zemo and Civil War was all about. The chess piece I think is just a way to show that he's becoming more human in the sense that he can also make mistakes and to show he's thinking about something. I don't think the chess piece implies that he was a Thanos' pawn in the movie or anything.

Its one of the most impressive things ever seen in comics in my opinion.  

But while Civil War was popular, opinions on how good it was are absolutely split.  I loved it at the time, and don't mind it now, but Stark was way over the top.  He wasn't far off from where he was after AXIS when he'd bee turned into a villain.

Not necessarily true. It just would've removed T'Challa as a player, but that still causes the conflict between the heroes because even if T'Chaka isn't killed, the Avengers are still going to apprehend Bucky. Also obviously Rhodey being hurt raised the stakes but even if Rhodey didn't get injured, the fight was brutal and results in them arresting and imprisoning 4 heroes. There's bad blood obviously when Tony visits them at the Raft and it has nothing to do with Rhodey being injured.

> The entire airport scene wasn't necessary. Hawkeye was able to fly in Ant-Man and Scarlet Witch from Avengers HQ, yet they have to steal a quinjet from the airport? The only reason for that was for them to face off (which justifies the name Civil War).

But they needed to get Bucky and Cap out of the country, which was the whole reason they met at the airport and brought back up. It's why the rest of the team allows them to get captured, the whole point was to evac Cap & Bucky since they're the ones being actively pursued.

>The fight was also completely avoidable by them talking it out. Cap could have let them take in Bucky under conditions until he cleared his name, Tony's smarter than to fall for the frame job, and he also should have already known Bucky killed his parents, since he copies the SHIELD archives in Avengers.

They did try to talk it out, multiple times, and Cap clearly doesn't believe Bucky is going to get a fair trial. He was actually almost on board until he finds out Tony has Vision imprisoning Wanda, which causes him to mistrust Tony's methods of handling Bucky and walk out from almost signing. Tony does not have, nor did he ever have, access to the highest-ranking SHIELD files, particularly the HYDRA-related files which are unearthed in WS, and it's made very clear throughout this film and the Winter Soldier that the WS' activity is predominantly redacted/destroyed (this is why Zemo spends a majority of the film gathering and discovering the evidence, he has to get the mission report directly from Bucky)

So Tony wanted to stop and capture Cap's team without hurting them, while Cap tried to run away to Siberia without hurting Tony's team. I believe Tony brought Spidey along to use his webbing powers to restrain people (like Spidey did with Cap).

Black Widow said ""this isn't gonna end well"" because she was worried someone would get hurt.

I don't think we've yet to see cap act compulsively. He's willing to die for bucky, but we've yet to see cap kill for him.

At the end of the day, cap feels VERY guilty for where tony is at as well. He admits in his letter that not telling tony the truth was simply protecting himself. When cap and iron man fight, Iron man is in the position where he's blinded by rage, and that he was willing to kill. Captain america was fighting defensively. He was desperate, but only offensive to the point where he wants to end the fight.

So I think it would have been possible that Tony would kill Cap or bucky, but the final blow from cap's shield would never have been a killing blow.",4i35uf

Otherwise Tony asked him point blank and he lied, then changed his mind and told the truth?  I don't think that's what happened in the scene.

This meshes with the scene in Zola's bunker with the newspaper clipping shown of the Starks' ""accident"" in The Winter Soldier.  As far as I can remember Captain America's never told, nor shown anything that explicitly implicates Bucky in the murder.  I'm not sure which file you're referring to specifically.  Bucky's SHIELD file wouldn't have that information in it.  

>he didn't seem particularly surprised by the reveal.

It isn't surprising.  He knew Hydra was behind it but not the specifics.  It makes sense that it was Bucky but he had no reason to specifically suspect Bucky beforehand.

>And why would he intentionally hide that HYDRA killed his father? The only reason would be that he knew Bucky was connected.

He said it was to spare Stark's feelings(or some such).  That wouldn't be strictly true if he knew it was Bucky, since his primary motivation at that point would probably be protecting Bucky from Stark.  In order for Steve to have known it was Bucky he'd have to be lying twice in that scene in Civil War, which seems out of character.  Furthermore, it's never suggested beforehand that Steve has that knowledge(even with just a reaction shot looking at some documents or whatever earlier in the movie or in Winter Soldier), which is a bit weird given the scope of the reveal.  

Basically - Steve said he didn't know it was Bucky, and reinforced it by saying he was trying to protect Stark(not Bucky).  We've never been shown on screen that he knew it was Bucky.  Unless we think he's lying on both counts we have to accept that he didn't know it was Bucky, just that it was Hydra.

Spoilers, you're about to contradict yourself. Either we're in the MCU or we're in the real one. Your personal experiences with the U.N., while interesting, are irrelevant in the context of this film. So we deal with the real world or we deal with one in which the countries of Wakanda and Sokovia exist. Pick one.

>It would be if this weren't a comic book movie and Cap weren't a paragon of virtue.

Yeah, I'm sorry, I gave it away in the first paragraph. So yes, we *are* in a comic book movie. That means that you have no idea what the world governments are like in that universe. And, also? He's no paragon of virtue. He's about as selfish as they come. He has good intentions, but he's not exactly someone to look up to. I'll explain further down.

>Hydra had infiltrated SHIELD for decades while he was frozen, there's no way you can blame that debacle on him. If anything he minimized the loss of life (remember how those ships were targeting MILLIONS of people?).

He didn't eliminate Hydra while he was alive. If we're going to blame every tangential fuck up that happened because of Tony's actions on him, I expect that we do the same for Cap. Cap wanted the serum. Not just like, casually wanted it. He was a weak and frail man child that could barely qualify to do admin work, let alone join the military. The only way he's able to be any kind of soldier is with his super serum. He volunteers for the experiment. It's a massive success (only with him) and he becomes Captain America. Oh, also? As a result of this, we get the Hulk, the Abomination, Extremis, the death of Howard Stark and his wife as well as countless other people, the Winter Soldier program, the Ant Man program and it's related fuck ups later on, etc. Do you see my point? Steve volunteering and surviving led to the deaths of countless other people. And yeah he had good intentions, but can you say any different for Tony?

>Yeah I've talked about this with some friends who haven't seen all of the previous marvel movies and even though this one is a pretty good standalone, there are so many things you miss if you haven't seen the everything else.

I have seen everything else. I just don't especially remember Winter Soldier since I've only really seen it once. I think this was just a bit of poor filmmaking on their part.

>He *is* incorruptible. I even remember reading an interview with RDJ where he was like (and i'm paraphrasing) ""Tony has to lead this team, then we talked and realized that Captain America's selflessness and purity make him a better fit"".

Sure, that doesn't make him right. In fact we have explicit proof in this film, Civil War, that he can be completely incorruptible, totally loyal (to those he chooses to be, regardless of what others have done for him), and a paragon of virtue and still be dead wrong about what's happening. He and Bucky are in a race against time to stop a bunch of other Winter Soldiers and...that never happened because the bad guy killed them. Because that was never his plan. They got it wrong.

>Again, Cap is the guy who tries to stop a bad situation that's already in progress. Tony's the guy who's (more often than not) fixing a situation he created (Iron Man 1, Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3, and Avengers 2). When Cap does anything he's savings lives more lives than would otherwise be lost. If you really disagree with that then please, provide an example.

Bucky is Cap's bad situation. The deaths when he escapes after being brainwashed are Cap's fault more than Zemo's. But let's go through Tony. 

Iron Man: he realizes he's selling weapons to the enemy, creates robotic armor to leave his captivity, and shuts down the weapons division of his company. Was it a situation of his making? Yes. Did he also fix it? Yes. Stane is a damned megalomaniac and if you think Stark saw him trying to make a suit himself coming, I'm not sure what to tell you. 

Iron Man 2: entire story is about Tony's dad, not Tony. Howard finds out that Vanko is a traitor and exiles him. This leads to little Ivan becoming Whiplash. Yeah, Tony is an asshole, but none of what happened was his fault. He created a robotic suit that he could use, not anyone else. He makes one for Rhodes because they're friends and he's the only military person Tony trusts, but Rhodes betrays him when Tony goes off the rails. Regardless, Hammer is the ultimate fuck up here for partnering with a known criminal to modify the drones.

Iron Man 3: Tony literally rejects Killian at the beginning of the film. Also, Killian is trying to make an analogue to the super soldier serum that created Captain America. Nothing in that movie is about anything Tony did wrong. Yeah he's a dick, but he's not responsible for *anything* bad that happens in that film.

Avengers 2: In what world would you ever think that the planetary defense system that you created to protect the world from space gods would go sentient because of a rock? Ultron is Tony's fault, but the idea itself is not a bad one. The world needs some sort of defense against another invasion like the Chithauri. It's not like Cap is full of ideas on this front, so Tony and Bruce make Ultron. Where in any of that is it assumed that Tony saw this coming? Oh, and not to mention, at this point there is no S.H.I.E.L.D., so someone has to look out for the world.

>I thought we were talking about the first Captain America movie? Anyway, in Civil War he's protecting his (innocent) friend from being killed (that was their orders), and when Bucky almost tosses one of the policemen off the railing Cap catches him and says ""come on"". He's all about protecting innocents.

We have never been talking about the first Cap movie. I'm not even sure where you go that idea from. And yeah, he's protecting his innocent friend and he's all about protecting innocents. Except the innocent German soldiers that came to apprehend Bucky. Or the innocents like Spider Man he fought in the airport. Or the innocents he got imprisoned, like Hawkeye and Wanda (not like Stark invited them, he was keeping them safe). And lest we forget, he is entirely wrong about Zemo's motive. At no point does he tell anyone that this guy is in play. Stark has to figure it out by asking Wilson after he's imprisoned, at which point Stark goes to *help* Cap and Bucky. Rogers actively keeps secrets from his friends which lead to people being hurt. He is so convinced that he's right and cannot contemplate being wrong, that people die as a result.

But let's go to the beginning of the film. Rogers and his team, completely unsanctioned by any government and *without coordinating with local authorities*, go to Lagos and duke it out with a terrorist group. The terrorist group is killed or apprehended and in the process a peacekeeping delegation is killed. Cap then talks to Wanda, who is horrified at the collateral damage (remember, she nearly died as collateral damage as a child), and tells her that she can't focus on the things they may have done wrong. Are you kidding me. Cap literally wants to run around as the world's moral authority with zero accountability. Judging the damage the Avengers have caused, it's understandable that the world disagrees. Tony understands that. If Rogers was such a paragon of virtue, he would know that even people with good intentions can get it wrong.

>When has he ever been wrong? (And i'm talking about the movies, not the comics)

The entire film. Minus Bucky's innocence, Cap is literally wrong about everything else. By not signing, he relinquishes control and everyone that sides with him ends up worse off because of it (something both the Vision and Tony told him would happen). He is also completely wrong about Zemo's mission. At the end, the bad guy won. The Avengers have split up. Cap isn't like Batman at the end of The Dark Knight, he is literally a criminal who beat the shit out of his friends to protect a different friend (never once explaining that Bucky was brainwashed, incidentally), then he goes to stop Zemo from activating more Winter Soldiers, only to discover that he was completely wrong about Zemo's plan. Between Tony and Steve, in this film, Steve is pretty much wrong constantly but is put forward as the one in the right. Because he means well. But Tony did too, he's just a dick about it, so he's easier to shit on. Cap does just as much bad and arguably worse (again, Hulk and Extremis are Cap's fault if you want to blame Stane and Sokovia on Tony). I mean, the dude kept the killers of Tony's parents from him. Not even a ""Hydra did it."" Did you see the look of hurt and betrayal in Tony's eyes when he says, ""So was I"" in response to Cap defending Bucky as his friend? Despite their differences, Tony did nothing but try to protect Steve *and* Bucky until the end of the film. So yeah, Cap is pretty much only wrong the entire time.",4i35uf
d2v496p,"I absolutely understand that there are people who feel that Captain America was wrong. Nevermind that the movie ultimately vindicated him, indisputably. (Otherwise, he'd have lost, right? Right?)

I feel like those people are too tied to these beliefs that have been drummed into us by bureaucracies who don't want to see anything challenge their power and authority.
",4i35uf
d2v8zi8,"Well, you're making a few mistakes with your reasoning. Sorry, will answer your points out of order.

Did his pal Bucky bring down the helicarrier and kill those people, or was he a tool used by the actual villain? Are we going to blame the gun, or the guy holding the gun?  Was the captain the bad guy who picked up Sokovia? Was he an alien invader who blew up New York? Why are you assigning blame to the good guys, when there were clearly bad actors involved? Ah, because someone needs to pay for this! And the bad guys are gone, so let's look towards who is left. That's the logic that these people are using.

As for the airport, who knows what happened after, whether the Captain offered to pick up the bill, but we do know that no lives were lost. What a bureaucratic thing to say though - my goodness look at all this damage *our mistake* caused, who is going to pay for this, the people who proved us wrong? Tut tut indeed.

> You want to pretend that it's okay for any single entity to have tons of power and no oversight and they'll always be right and should never be brought to account for a hit that they break?

Let's take a look at who is *really* pretending.

I never said that the Avengers would always be right. They could absolutely be brought to account if and when they make mistakes. Case in point - magic handsy McCuteyPants. Ooops, the bomb that she was trying to protect the captain from blew up a building instead. Consequences for her? Clear and demonstrated in the movie. 

Now do the same thing to a government or bureaucratic panel. How much time did any of the Bush officials serve for getting America into two senseless wars? How much time will Obama face for executing people with no judge, no jury, no legal process in any sense that a civilized person would recognize? Take any number of awful things that governments have done in their people's names, and look at how practically none of them are held to account. Oh no! They didn't get elected again, and are now working as lobbyists or directly for corporations, earning tens of millions of dollars! The reality is, it's *MUCH* more likely that an individual will be held to account for his or her actions than ANY bureaucratic government panel (or other special interest group) will *ever* be.

> I believe that a combination of group discussions/ decision making and individual responsibility are much better.

Go ahead and make that movie that supports your argument. Well, you kinda did. Captain America on a taskforce! Captain America voting on a committee! How's it end? Well, the committee deadlocked this time. Or the Captain couldn't convince enough people. Or maybe he did. It seems to be the luck of the draw with governments getting anything right.

Sorry, but what this movie did was take the absolute best case scenarios, the worst case scenarios, and evaluated them. That's critical thinking. That's reasoning. Not running things through a committee, voting on well, what's politically expedient. Take your statement, look at it as if this is right or wrong, what are the best case and worst case outcomes, and then run through the scenarios logically.

> Like it or not, all the avengers were damn-near destroyed by a random non-super villain because his family died at their hands and he had no other recourse.

They weren't almost destroyed by the non-super, they were pulled apart by the moral and ethical question of where responsibility needs to lay. The NonSuper, who wasn't acting rationally by the way, probably because his family was killed by (what was it, aliens? who were the bad guys who picked up Sokovia, I forget), wasn't at all required in breaking up the avengers. He was used in the movie to demonstrate how and why figuring out right vs wrong by a committee is fundamentally flawed. That the Avengers were split was solely down to the two camps within the Avengers having this *exact conversation* that we're having, and then looking at it logically to see what the flaws are with both sides. And your side lost. Sorry, but it lost. This doesn't mean that Captain America is a better superhero, or that the Ironman sucks, or any of that triviality is of any importance. It's that this discussion was had, evaluated, and came to a resounding conclusion.


>  Tony is making hard choices and dealing with the public out-cry and Cap just wants to punch his way through everything.

No, sorry, the reality is is that Tony was looking to shift the responsibility for what would eventually happen to someone else (the UN committee) whereas Captain America said no, the responsibility ends with me. Tony felt guilty, he didn't like feeling guilty, and to soften this, some sort of oversight would help with the guilt. Except it's an illusion. A bureaucratic committee doesn't absolve the Avengers of anything, but it sure does feel good to pretend like it might. The movie alludes to this by having Tony wear his special glasses, telling his dad that he loves him, one last time.

>  Had Cap negotiated and gotten his voice on a committee dealing with enhanced peoples, he could have pointed out that WS has no motive for bombing the accords meeting, and defended his civil right to a trial. 


WS had no motive for bombing the accords? Isn't this the same guy responsible for ... golly, killing tons of shield agents and bringing down a helicarrier? And now we're supposed to believe that he's not that bad? Something is wrong with your logic. Look, this guy is a dangerous terrorist, and you know how we deal with dangerous terrorists. What's that, it was someone else? Are you saying we've made a mistake? Nonsense and poppycock, we feed the Avengers their intelligence, we never make mistakes! And so on and so forth.

But after some thought, I've changed my stance on the matter. It wasn't selfish, it was just irresponsible.

Just like with the grants he handed out at MIT in the beginning, he was giving Peter a very unique opportunity.

But he also still brought a 15-year-old to a fight against two trained super soldiers, one of whom was kinda known for going into seemingly random Murder Mode. And what happens? Spider-Man gets crushed (or nearly crushed?) by a semi -- by Captain America.

Tony showed some concern for Spidey, but *Cap* of all people probably hit him the hardest -- and Cap didn't have any true idea of how much Spider-Man could take, and even recognized him as quite a bit younger than everyone else. I guess he acted just as if not more irresponsibly than Tony regarding that.

They're both acting somewhat irrationally, but only Tony is made out to be in the wrong. If anything, it's the UN that was the bad guy -- going after Bucky with only a blurry picture as proof?

Had so many not been bent on bringing him to an injust justice, I'm sure someone like Tony Stark would be well capable of finding a way to remedy or suppress it. But because they went at him like he was doing it of his own will, they never thought to try and fix him, though I'm guessing that's going to happen at some point around Infinity War.

Because it puts a check on individuals with extreme power? Absolute power corrupts absolutely. In the end, it's not even about the number of people you hypothetically save, because it's just anyone's guess whether or not they truly would have saved more without oversight. What is for certain is that an organization without transparency and who doesn't answer to anyone but their own ideals is a stone's throw away from abuse and corruption, which in the end, is more unacceptable.

>She didn't do it, Crossbones did. Either everyone on the ground was going to die, including Captain America, or she could try to stop or mitigate it, which she did.

Doesn't matter who did it, she doesn't have control over her powers. She could have sent it into the ground, like she sent the Vision to escape, she could have sent it farther away in a different direction that could have theoretically not blown up a building. Point is, she's a child who isn't ready for the field, and it was irresponsible for Cap's unilateral decision to take her onto foreign soil when she's not ready. Further, she just a year earlier was a pawn of Hydra and could easily be using her powers to hurt rather than help. I'm not arguing the virtue of her character, I'm saying that given the context of the world where superhumans are relatively new, there is no reason why people should trust her judgment when she's a child with unlimited powers. How would you feel if you were sitting in the hospital, and a superhuman fight broke out miles away and ended up right outside your window and a bomb was re-directed up to your floor, wiping you and your family out? How would you feel knowing that these superheroes had no legal right to be there and had no authority to answer to anything other than their ""morals""?

> he's not completely opposed to any form of oversight. It just needs to be done the right way.

That's the problem I have with Cap. He alone thinks he knows the right way, but the problem with real life is that there is no perfectly right way. The only reason why he gets away with the shit he does is because he's a comic book character. Take for example his defense of Bucky during the GSG9 raid. How many soldiers were probably maimed for doing their jobs? They were getting kicked through walls, throw down stairs, and having their faces smashed in. Someone could easily have died, and all for what? So Cap could save one friend. How did Cap know for sure Bucky wouldn't kill anyone? All he had was a hunch, which luckily for everyone turned out to be true...but that doesn't make it any less irresponsible. At the end of the day, it's just a comic book movie and I enjoyed it thoroughly, but its also a good movie because it calls into question some very real life ethical scenarios, and in this situation Cap really went too far.
