dpneqvm,I could watch two hours of Willem Dafoe shooing away herons. ,7c5s8i
dpnedef,"I thought Willem Dafoe was actually the most interesting piece of the movie - the relationship with his son, the deal he has with the other motels to help Halley, the fondness he has for the children, and the entire role he plays in the climax.

I also thought the plot point about Halley going into prostitution was very smartly set up, with some great visual storytelling. The bikini photos had me thinking she was putting herself on the internet, then the shots of Moonee in the bath solidified it for me. The movie eventually does make it explicit, but the visual storytelling was very smart.

Great film, fantastic performances all around. If anything, I think the film could've used even more heart, and some final interactions with Bobby.",7c5s8i
dpota9o,"The fact they never pay off anything with the Dafoe character is absolutely incredible. I was waiting for his hero moment. Every movie has that moment. He’d run fearlessly fast down the street after Moonee, embrace her in his arms, maybe even end up comforting her.

Yet, none of that happens. 

He smokes a cigarette and the movie never shows him again.

What a fucking gut punch. 

Thank you Willem Dafoe. Thank you Sean Baker. AND THANK YOU 2017, the best year for movies I’ve ever lived through. ",7c5s8i

dpr8zki,"The last scene I could take or leave, but god the emotional climax right before that [where the little girl cries in a tight close up right into the camera](#spoiler) was a mindblowing achievement.

This film had an amazing story, and was very emotional, but was also just a straight up technical achievement. Getting that level of performance out of children and other non actors is a technical achievement. Finding those exterior and using them to create an environment that was disgustingly banal and familiar as well as totally surreal and foreign was a technical achievement.

I felt like I was watching a lesson in how to make a movie - and that this guy was doing something no one else does. Non actors, real places - that is the cutting edge of cinematic technique.

This was a worthy successor to Tangerine (though tangerine was still better - if you haven't seen that then RUN ! Go see it right now!)",7c5s8i

They hitched a ride - the only means they had to get there because they're poor - in order to see fireworks. Fireworks that are put on by the very people that have made this situation around Disney Land so bad. They are taking the only benefit that they possibly can get from the gentrification. The rich can block them out of most of their enjoyment but they don't own the fucking sky yet. 

It also showed that while the mom had little redeeming qualities, she goes out of her way to try to make them happy, even if it means standing in the face of the ultimate embodiment of her disenfranchisement. The disenfranchisement that has caused her to a large extent to be how she is.",7c5s8i

dpnjnpd,"I saw this film a few weeks ago and it's really grew on me since then. Here were my thoughts when I came out of the screening, which I posted on my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/LooneyMatthew/)

1. Halley is one of the best antiheroes of the year so far, along with Connie from Good Time. Unlike Connie, Halley sticks by her daughter not out of necessity, but out of a place of love and compassion. As she spites, cons, and worms her way out of trouble, she brings Moonie along and treats it as one big adventure. Scenes where the two are playing make you forget that in a previous one she had stolen $1600 worth of Disney World tickets.

2. Some may criticize the lack of a traditional structure, but to me I felt it was necessary. This film felt like watching a stream of consciousness unfold. It's sort of like a child's mind, where they say and do whatever without any thought of the consequences. The characters don't have motivations or goals, they simply live life like a child, in the moment. The film stock brings a nostalgic touch, and I will admit I thought a lot about childhood friends that moved away when I was 6. It's a film that feels so open yet there's always something there holding the characters back.

3. Which brings me to another aspect some may criticize it for: the ending. Ignoring the whole iPhone aspect, I felt it was a brilliant conclusion to the story. Throughout the 2 hour runtime, we get little hints of a much better world just beyond the motel (the Brazilian tourists, the ticket scalpers) but we never explicitly see it until the end. Moonie and Jancey finally break free from what little shackles they had and get a glimpse of pure unfiltered happiness, a glimpse at the good life. While the adults are caught up in serious affairs, the children focus on something much more important to them: spending one more day carefree, without it being taken away. With with the ignorance of childhood crumbling, they go out to the one place they have yet to explore. A great ending that will be debated for years to come.

4. That scene with the herons had to have been improvised. They must have wandered on set and Sean Baker and William Dafoe just started rolling. Probably my favorite moment in the movie. Besides the ending of course.

5. This is one of the best films of the year, but I'm not convinced this is a masterpiece yet. I think that time will make or break this movie's legacy.",7c5s8i
dtayb7x,"The only reason I watched this movie was because of all the critical acclaim it was receiving but I'm so happy that I did. This movie wrecked me, broke me and then left me in pieces. No regrets though.

This movie is told from the kids POV, especially Moonee's perspective. This kinda makes the depressing premise of the movie kind of bearable since Moonee is an incredibly resilient child, I kind of feel that even-though the reality of her situation is terrible, the director makes us believe that she is oblivious to the conditions she lives in as she is portrayed as this rambunctious little girl who can never stay still and is always getting herself into trouble.
There are so many subtle poignant scenes in this movie, my favorite was when Moonee and Chancey are sitting on a fallen tree and Moonee says ""You know why this is my favorite tree? Because it's tipped over but it's still growing""..that moment shows how aware she is of her situation, how broken down and dysfunctional her life is..and this tiny 6 year old girl is hyper aware of that....broke my heart.

The film never looks down on the inhabitants of the motel, I didn't feel for a second that this movie was telling me ""Ohhh look at these poor people"", it rather objectively observes them, it almost feels like a documentary. One can argue that there is no real plot in the traditional sense but every scene feels just right, like it's meant to be there. 

I know many people despised the ending but I think it was the best part of the movie, it's both absolutely beautiful and utterly devastating. It really showcased the resilience of a child's mind, how little Moonee desperately wanted the happy ending she deserved but knew she would never get. The break of shooting style and quality, whilst mandatory for the director to film inside Disney, also showcases the break from reality..that this isn't real...that Moonee is probably being taken by CPS at this moment. We didn't need to see it to know it's going to happen, it was inevitable but by showing us the fantasy, the film stays true to telling the story from Moonee's perspective.

This was such a terrific film, the girl who plays Moonee deserves way more recognition that she has gotten so far. (that crying scene alone deserves a gazillion oscars)",7c5s8i
ducwp57,Rewatching I just noticed there are like 4 scenes of just Moonee playing in the bath tub with music on in the background... Very subtle but I guess these are all the times Halley is having 'guests' over,7c5s8i
dpne52c,"I saw this film a couple weeks ago and it's just slow crept into my best of the year and may be my new #1. It's just so endlessly empathetic. It's crazy because Halley absolutely should not have custody of her daughter yet you feel such empathy for her by the end. Brooklynn Prince is just incredible, one of those rare kid actors who just feels so natural in her work. And my god how great is it to see Willem Dafeo playing a normal person. I love what a father figure he was to these lonesome people yet he also had to be stern and cold due to the nature of his job. The way he just casually walks away once child services arrives, you know he's done this too many times to count. Also great to see how protective he was handling the pedophille. 

Sean Baker has made two incredible movies about subcultures I had no idea about. I hope he continues. He's a masterful director who just makes you live in these worlds in such a startling way.",7c5s8i

dpnloce,"So as a social worker this film really slapped me in the face. I think i viewed the characters differently and anyone working in social services will, i believe. 
I think the general purpose of the film is to ""open the eyes of our society"" to struggling people. But for someone who meets with these types of people daily (mainly the mother) I couldn't help but be even more upset with humanity. 
I love how angry and passionate this film made me. But then somehow made me melt into a puddle of sadness in the last 5 minutes.",7c5s8i
dpxir8m,"I love the movie, but Willem Dafoe is the real standout element of  this movie. Not only is he playing against type, he's playing against style. He gives such a naturalistic performance in this film, that I completely forgot that his usual shtick is playing over-the-top and theatrical characters. The scene where he confronts the guy who might be a child molester, showed to me that he knows exactly how to channel charm and charisma, and play a real person. That scene (and his final scene, where he comforts Moonee) could easily have devolved into emotionally sentimental shlock, but he chooses not to overplay either of those beats. The little hints that drop throughout the film of the kind of guy he really is are just so wonderfully acted by him, that I'm going to be pissed if he doesn't get a Best Supporting Actor nod later in the year. Also, I fucking love Macon Blair, and I love seeing Caleb Landry Jones in every movie of 2017",7c5s8i
dto8nno,"My two favorite lines are the ones made by Moonee:
1. ""I can always tell when adults are about to cry.""
2. ""Do you know... do you know why this is my favorite tree? Cause it tipped over. And it's still growing.""",7c5s8i
dpz6ob1,"Here's my take on the ending. 

Bobby has seen enough of Hallee's craziness and he is the one who contacted social services to come take Moonee. 

Here are the clues:
Bobby, in a serious mood, is typing on the computer in the office  (he's emailing soclal services). We've never seen him that focused. 

When they come to take Moonee, instead of coming to the recsue as usual, Bobby goes out back to smoke and block out what is happening. Why? He knows what's happening because he set it in motion. His concern for Moonee outweighs the pain of seeing her taken from her mom.

Baker is a serious filmmaker and he left a challenge for the vewier.

I never thought a child crying on screen would be such an emotional moment. The fact that she had remained cheerful for the entire duration of the movie was well thought out and effective.

One thing I didn’t understand - Was this film supposed to be set in the present? Since they used words like ‘selfie’ but I just went to Disney World and the exterior looks nothing like that. Or maybe I didn’t visit this part? Just clarify.

ds9nb0p,"I use to work on the road that this film was shot on. I think its been covered pretty well by many other youtube explorers but its amazing how down in the dumps the actual setting is. With its location so close to Disney World you'd imagine it to be a paradise.

1. It's not like they actually went

2. Our hearts were ripped out knowing [Mooney is going to be taken away and seeing her tear filled face, begging to spend the last few moments with her best friend](#spoiler). I honestly think Brooklyn Prince deserves an Oscar for that scene alone. To have that level of  control over one's own emotions like that is something I have seen many great adult actors struggle to do, if they could at all. Anyway, because of the audience knowing that, we don't need to see the whole process, we know it's going to happen so let's all enjoy that brief (fake) moment of hope/joy.   ",7c5s8i

It sucks cause the movie is great at portraying what life must really be like there, but if I’m being honest, a woman like her does not deserve a kid, no matter how much love they portray to each other.

dptlmth,"Review from [my Letterboxd account](https://letterboxd.com/txdrmst/)

Wow. I went into this seeing only the trailer, which made me feel like this was going to be a feel-good film. This is not a feel-good film.

There was a line that my friend pointed out to me, spoken by one of the children:

>""Do you know why this is my favourite tree? Because it's tipped over, and its still growing.""

This works as a wonderful metaphor for the film itself, and the situation the characters are living in. Each day they're simply trying to get by, trying to improve themselves and get out of a bad situation. Much like slapping a new coat of bright purple paint on a bed bug infested motel.

Sean Baker invites us into the world of children growing up in less than ideal conditions around less than ideal role models. The images are uncomfortable, unflinching, and at times heartbreaking. What makes it so real to me are the small glimmers of hope that we are able to see through the cracks in the foundation, the sense of community that's developed, and the caring of individuals like Bobby showing through in a difficult world.

In the end its that hopeful outlook of a child that prevails, wrapping up a somewhat devastating film in one of the most beautiful endings I've ever seen.

The performances here are absolutely outstanding, none of the actors are given over the top scenes which would allow them to appear as ""movie characters"" so what we're left with is profoundly human.

This one surprised me in becoming my new favourite of the year.",7c5s8i
drz8f5z,"Wondering why Brooklynn Prince is not being talked about for Best Supporting Actress.. Judi Dench won it for *Shakespeare in Love* and she was only onscreen for 8 minutes. I feel like Brooklynn Prince spent more than that in a tight close-up doing some super realistic emoting at the camera. I was so impressed and moved by her performance. Not once did I think, ""That kid is acting."" ",7c5s8i

dtzbvu7,"I loved how conflicted Bobby's face was at the end. On one hand, he obviously deeply cared for the girl and moonee. He gave them so many breaks throughout the movie. On the other hand, he must've know she was bound to self-destruct at one point or another and would probably take Moonee down with her. In a lot of ways Halley was just as immature as Moonee and I think the film wanted you to see that. That Halley was just this person who still hadn't grown up sadly and so she could have unlimited fun with Halley and let her do whatever she wants with no boundaries.",7c5s8i
dubqhiv,"Loved the da Foe character. Bobby. Someone else pointed out that the pedophile confrontation rubbed him the wrong way. Instead of just escorting the creep off the premises, Bobby toyed with him then humiliated him. Not defending the creep, but it became clear that Bobby has his own issues as well. 
And that’s great in a story! His character was very nuanced. 

Got to admit that I didn’t feel much “sympathy” for Haylee, but I did “empathize” with her. Which is close to reality, yeah? Where people don’t have to be saints or sinners. Her turning tricks and assaulting her friend crossed the line for me, but it works in the movie because Sean Baker isn’t trying to make us feel sorry for her. Just, “here’s what people do.” 

Overall, I liked this film a lot. Turned Tangerine off halfway through. Pleasantly surprised by Florida Project.",7c5s8i
dsv4egd,This movie is authentic asf. Its not only Florida thats like this.  Theres kids everywhere like this. I grew up with friends like this in Los Angeles. I mean not exactly but pretty close.

dpnepjz,"Saw it last month in limited release. Funny enough I live in Orlando so it’s trippy to think just how close it was filmed to the theatre I saw it in. Even more so to see how dead on it was about a lot of aspects of that part of town. The dark realities of the parents personal lives gave an awesome contrast to Moonee’s story. Those worlds crashing together in the third act was just heartbreaking. The ending was a little nuts though. How the hell did they get into Magic Kingdom lol. 

The little Orlando touches were nice too. Orange World, Twistee Treat, those sketchy Parks Passes kiosks, the faded Holler logo on the back of the old Honda, half built condos falling to ruin, and the ratchet moms going to OBT are all true to life. It was obviously filmed on location but those things prove it in the film for me. ",7c5s8i
dppb165,"Saw this two weeks ago. I really like this film. Bria Vinaite was probably my favorite part because it's feels so authentic. It's one of the most genuine performances I've seen. I never see the acting, if that makes sense.

 Brooklynn Prince as Moonee was great as well. She is a product of her environment, so she swears and uses a lot of adult phrases. There's a short scene where Moonee and Jancey were sharing an ice cream. Jancey gets her turn to lick the ice cream and Moonee tells her,""Get it, girl!"" or something like that. I just can't get over how hilarious it is to hear stuff like that in this film.

Willem Dafoe was awesome. Like someone else pointed out in this thread, he doesn't get his heroic moment in the film. The film constantly puts him in a situation where he helps out Mooney, so it was pretty surprising to see how passive he was during the whole social service scene at the end. The best scene in the film was Dafoe shooing away these birds. It's great.

I loved the slow pace. It's a film where it feels like nothing happens for long stretches of time. A lot of it is just meandering and lots of nothing, which is pretty realistic.

I also love how the film slowly builds up a plot in the last half. She sells these DisneyWorld bands to a random dude on the street, but we don't know where she got them. It's then revealed that the seemingly random scene of Halley and Mooney posing in swimsuits is actually Halley selling herself online to make money. Mooney is shown taking a bath for no reason several times towards the end, but she's actually being hidden from Halley's customers. We then get a scene where a man is demanding Halley return his bands because she stole them while he was there. I thought the reveal and the merging of these scenes that seem like they're unimportant but actually are was incredibly smart and well executed. 

The ending was ok. I don't hate it or love it. I see what he did and how he left it up to interpretation. It's ballsy for an ending to a movie that was, for the large, large majority, very realistic. Does it work, though? I think I was left a bit unsatisfied initially, but I grew to understand it more. I still think it could have been more satisfying. Sure, seeing Mooney being taken away isn't what we'd like, but it feels like the most natural progression for this film. 

Overall, I liked it quite a bit. It's easily one of the best this year. Great performances all around. ",7c5s8i
dppivwa,Those kids were fucking amazing.  Every scene seemed so natural and real.  Especially the main girl (Moonee).  Her seen towards the end when she breaks down at Jancey's door was such a skillful breakdown.   Such a genuinely pleasing yet heartbreaking film.  I also loved Willem Dafoe in his role.  Bria Vinaite played such a despicable character so very well.  Such a vibrant film.  Such a experience. ,7c5s8i

I think it's perfect. It's a huge risk to have such an ambiguous ending that's jarringly different than everything that came before it. 

Baker chooses to grant a wish for his characters and give them an escape. But it's all temporary. It won't last. It can't last. At the end of the day the park will close, and Moonie will be taken away from her mother.

dpnhcg1,"With Florida Project and Tangerine I think Sean Baker has become one one the most exciting and thoughtful filmmakers out there. 

Florida Project is probably the best movie I saw this year, the children were absolutely phenomenal and I loved how Baker managed to visualize the world both from a child and adult's perspective. Depending on which characters you followed at any given time in the movie you were either awestruck by the wonder and magic in the air, with locations like the ice cream store, that weird wizard shop, the pool, or the purple apartment. The world was depicted and realized from a child's perspective. But then he also managed to depict the gritty, not so savoury aspects of the Florida projects in abundance as well when we get into the adult story lines. I thought the depiction of those two worlds was handled quite deftly.

I also really enjoyed how the theme of upheaval in Moonee's life was reinforced throughout the movie with her making new friends and losing old friends throughout. Moonee's resilience through it was kinda incredibly inspiring and gave you some hope that she'd manage to take on the giant impending obstacles in her future. The performances were also obviously great all around, with Willem Dafoe being a stand out.  

I think critiques of the ending calling it jarring and out place are fair, but I personally loved it. And it may just be the part of me that wanted a happy ending to the whole story speaking, but i thought the idea that a child's imagination could somehow be a coping mechanism for an otherwise shitty reality was a theme developed throughout the movie and reinforced with the seemingly fairytale ending. I also know it was mostly by necessity but i loved how the final scene was shot, it was kinda magical. ",7c5s8i
dpssx6t,"Surprised so many people hate the final scene. It seemed very obvious to me that this was wish fulfillment on the part of the kids; the filming format even changes suddenly which implies it's meant to be dreamlike, even though it was really just a technical limitation for filming in Disneyworld.

It definitely reminded me how resilient and resourceful children can be despite their difficult environment.  I was aware the acting by Brooklyn (daughter) and Bria (mother) was outstanding but they surprised me.  The scene when Moonee was nearly speechless and crying to her friend was incredible and worthy of a nomination.  I didn't expect it to hit me so emotionally.

Never believed what we were seeing at the very end was anything real, just the only thing Jancey could think of even doing to make her friend feel better (and being the mind of a child, explains the complete shift in style of filming). Being from Florida and knowing how true it is that these sort of lives exist just a few miles from places like Disney, I thought it was very effective. Honestly was surprised Baker isn't a native of Florida as well after seeing it. The setting reminded me of Panama City on any weekend that isn't Spring Break.

Learning during Escape from Tomorrowland about Disney's filming restrictions added to the bittersweet fictional tone of the final moments for me, since I recognized it must've been shot guerrilla style. ",7c5s8i

dvk2w9e,"Finally, finally got to sit down and watch this after months of wanting to. 

As a whole, I really enjoyed it. There were some frustrating aspects of this film, but I appreciated them as I suspect that every detail of this movie was placed in it for a reason.

The main complaint I see about it is plot, or lack of plot. Aside from the ending, it seems like that's the man thing people had issue with. I understand that, but I tend to think that plot isn't everything, it's just that most novels, movies, etc. are driven by a linear plot. This one wasn't. For some, that's frustrating. It was for me a bit frustrating as well, but I think the way events in the story are presented here are almost designed to frustrate, and I'd argue that it forces viewers to experience the world through the eyes of a child, where you have little agency and even less of a grasp on what you're doing that day to make progress through your life. I could also see how the same presentation reflects the daily lives of poor people like those depicted: Slogging through a mundane existence in a bleak place, looking for little blips of excitement or respite to color your day. 

As far as the realism on display here in both setting and characters, it's outstanding. Just superb. It's easy to despise Halley, and that's the point. It's easy to wait for Bobby to be a hero or Moonie to do something profound (and unrealistic) to change Moonie's fate, but they don't, and that's also done on purpose. I don't think this movie was ever intent on resorting to cliche to ""solve"" the problems of the characters. If this were a novel, it'd be literary journalism, not a dime store paperback. 

I hope I don't sound snobbish writing this. I didn't love the ending, and I often hated Halley. I felt frustrated at times, as I said, by the plot structure. But overall, I truly enjoyed this experience, I think it was a job well done, and I'm glad I finally got to watch it.",7c5s8i

It's a gorgeous film as well, with all those garishly painted hotels and shots of the Florida sunsets.

At the theater I was at, when it ended there was a sort of silence from people reflecting on what we've just seen, many of them didn't leave their seats for a while, which is strange as in my experience people usually rush for the exits.

dssv80k,"[The Florida Project](http://hvnreviews.com/the-florida-project/) is one of the best films to come out in 2017, simply because of how authentic and immersive it feels. It really gives the sense of being a kid, with vibrant cinematography, and creative camerawork with a lot of low angles to make it look like their point of view. It's incredibly depressing because it feels like you're watching real people live their lives. This is isn't just thanks to the fantastic writing and directing, but also the incredible performances, even from the child stars.

dusj8ll,"I see a lot of comments here saying that people were relieved when child services came for Moonee at the end. But I wouldn't say that I agree. Separating a child from a mother does not usually end well for the child psychologically. I do admit that her surroundings were not conducive for a good education or a better life. But making her live with a new family while her mother still loves her and she still loves her mother is going to introduce emotional and psychological issues of its own. Maybe they could have found a middle ground by letting her stay with her mom while they provide her with an education and whatever else the kid needs. As for her mom's prostitution while the kid is in the bathroom, she only does it because she doesn't have anyone else to take care of the kid. Maybe they can offer babysitting or similar services to help out with the child if they really do care about the child.",7c5s8i
dtnbxet,"The way music was incorporated was really original and interesting, sounding like it was coming from an actual iPhone or cheap portable speaker was just so immersive and authentic. That stood out to me throughout the film and I loved every scene with it even though I wouldn't be particularly partial to that trap rap sub-genre. 

Also the cinematography was real eye candy. This place is obviously not Beverly Hills, and is even referenced as being ""a dump"" by the client she stole from. But the way it's shot, it looks so vibrant and beautiful, which may be another allusion to the film showing the world through children's eyes.

The helicopter kind of intrigued me. There wasn't much plot, but it felt like the helicopter coming and going was wrapping up each act of the film or something? I don't know.

Also loved Defoe in this. So used to seeing him as playing a role with huge gravitas and presence. He really hit every subtle note right here though.",7c5s8i

dpo765w,"Oh hey, didn't realize there was a discussion thread for this!

I fucking love this movie. I'm gonna need to see it again to be sure, but it might just be the best movie I've seen all year. I adore how Sean Baker manages to take us into the lives of these people, a slice of society we sort of take for granted, and present them as real human beings. Yes, they can be horrible people, but they can also be loving and warm. Willem Dafoe's character really highlights this: they're annoying and their sense of morality and ethics are skewed, but we know he can't bring himself to knock them down any further on the ladder of socioeconomic status.

Just incredibly acted all around. Brooklynn Prince has more talent in her fingertip than I do in my whole body. That scene where she breaks down at the end hit me like a fucking train. Bria Vinaite was great too, especially towards the end where things get a lot more complicated and her love for Moonee really shows. And fucking Willem Dafoe... holy shit. Go ahead and give him the Oscar. Just a beautiful, tender, understated performance. Scenes like the one where he catches the perv, and even little moments like where he shoos the birds away, sell so much about his charscter.

I've heard a lot of complaints about the ending, and I'd like to see it at least one more time to really let it sink in, but I think I like it. Yes, the jump from film to iPhone, and from silent to orchestrated music, is jarring. But I think it's intentional. I think there's two ways to interpret it: one, in all of their naivete, Moonee and Jancey really do run away to Disney (which has been subtly hinted at throughout with the fireworks and just the setting of the film overall), realizing this is the only way to be happy in the way they are right now. Of course, it can't last forever - they'll be caught in no time - but it's enough for them in the moment. Or two, it's not literal, a daydream in a similar attempt to escape the harsh reality that's about to overcome Moonee, which I think fits with the jump to a more dreamlike, surreal filmmaking style.

What a heartbreakingly beautiful movie. I rewatched Sean Baker's flicks beforehand, and it's easy to say this is my favorite of all.. This is my top movie of the year. I rarely ever cry during movies but this one got me. I can see why some of you thought it was slow and/or that the ending was shit, but I don’t agree. The pacing was so realistic, we slowly saw how Halley became more desperate for money. And this all unravelling as Moonee grows up, shit that ruined me. Those little moments between the mother and daughter were the most tragic parts.. we know Halley loves Moonee to death but that she has her faults and these progressively make her unfit to parent. William Dafoe was perfect, we can see his pity and pain and can resonate so much with him.

At first I thought maybe it symbolizes Halley, who despite ""being fallen"", is trying to grow and being good mum to her daughter.

About the ending, initially I thought it was really happening, but I also immediately said ""no way can anyone sneak into the Magic Kingdom without tickets."" After thinking about that more, and reading some of the comments here, I don't think it's ambiguous at all - this scene was 100% fantasy. It's optimistic in that the girl(s) can retreat to a fantasy world even in the presence of dire circumstances, but it's also completely tragic. And while the ""parks"" are alluded to a few times in the film, this draws a direct connection - there's a place where thousands of families are blissfully enjoying vacations and not thinking of hardships, and mere miles away poverty and lack of opportunity are tearing families apart. After the screen went black, I sat for a few minutes watching the credits, and you can hear (very softly) the sounds of Magic Kingdom visitors blissfully enjoying their day at the park.

Second the ending was beyond stupid and silly & did not fit the film's tone.  Just felt like something the director thought was cute.  Also I guess 2 little girls can easily sneak into Disney World and not be stopped.  Cool.

I'm assuming I'll get downvvoted but I found this okay at best.  Cool experimental work but I don't see myself ever revisiting it nor can I see THIS being the best movie of the year.  This and Lady Bird, still can't understand the hype & praise.",7c5s8i

The scene with Moonee at the buffet towards the end was one of the most heartbreaking/warming scenes of the year. The scene with Moonee running away and Halley arguing with Child Services was ridiculously tense and I could barely watch. 

I'm still really unsure about the ending. I felt like they should have ended it immediately after they start running. Leave the rest to the imagination, maybe just bring the camera up and reveal Disney World far in the distance.

dpoof6q,"Saw this today. I rated it a 6 on the poll here. It's a decent film with some great moments, but I don't feel like it stands out among others I've watched. There were a couple of times where I absent mindedly reached for my phone to check the time, which isn't a great sign. I normally like slow-paced films so I don't think it was that, exactly. Perhaps just a sagging middle - or too sagging for my liking - but some wonderful moments and some near-tears at the end.

Stuff I liked:

- **Characters** absolutely spot on. Fantastic characters, very well drawn, very well acted. I felt sympathy for all of them and I found all of them well-rounded and engaging. The kids were especially wonderful.

- **Colour palette** - just loved the way all those bright colours contrasted with the content. It really brought something to the film to choose those particular buildings. Loved the tracking shots by the over-the-top gift shops etc. too. I mean, maybe that's just what Florida looks like, I have no idea. But it was such a good setting for this story.

- **'Extraneous' vignettes** - Extraneous probably the wrong word, but this kind of links in with the idea of the characters being rounded. There were no lazy characters here, the writers really made an effort to give everyone their own lives - for e.g. Bobby and his son, which wasn't really 'necessary' to the film but added to it tremendously.

- **The ending** - quick skim of the comments suggests others didn't like it? Loved it. Everything from the climax right to the end, the film - which by then had lost my interest a little - grabbed me right back and I was glued. I found the juxtaposition of the image you see at the end with the content to be touching and well-played. Perhaps others found it heavy handed? I'm not sure, but I felt it fit very well into the running theme throughout the film of a juxtaposition between the 'brightness' and 'magic' of the setting vs what people's lives were actually like. The metaphor then expands, I think, into the idea of the American Dream and the inherent artifice of that. The climax too - the future for Mooney - was well-done and very moving.

Things I didn't like:

- I needed more story in the story, that's pretty much all it was - not necessarily a traditional 'story arc'. I agree with others here that the 'living in the moment' narrative perfectly suited the film. I think I just needed to care a bit more early on - I needed to see the characters care about something a *little* more than they did so I could feel them a little more intimately. Obviously, it's part of those characters that they are stoic to some extent, but there still could have been a little more emotional reaction, even if kept really subtle, and that would have kept my engagement. Like I say, I'm used to slow paced films and character pieces and generally enjoy them, but in this case my mind just kept wandering. The beginning and end was great, but I just struggled through the middle. I probably could have done with some higher stakes earlier on or more emotional engagement than I got. For instance [if Mooney had been more upset about losing her friend - couldn't understand his name. Scooty?](#spoiler) that might have helped me stay with it a bit more but it kinda seemed like she was a bit too ok with it for me. And maybe if [there had been more fear for Mooney around men coming to the house](#spoiler). We saw a bit of that, but I think perhaps extending that feeling of threat a little would have helped me. Also, [an extension on the hinted-at need for Mooney to be close to Jancey](#spoiler). I liked that this was subtly done but it would have perhaps been good [if Jancey had had firmer boundaries set by her grandmother and wasn't always available to play with Mooney](#spoiler) then we would have seen a larger reaction from her which would have been more captivating for me. Basically, I think the environment *would* have been disturbing to a child to some degree and we didn't see enough of the aftermath of that for me. We saw the result of poor boundaries on behaviour, but I think I would have liked to see the emotional deficit coming through a little more.",7c5s8i
dpxzfpt,"The thing that carries this movie is that (similar to Moonlight) it's totally unpredictable, what unfolds is not what we expect, it gives us something that we didn't know we wanted. [I think we were all expecting Bobby to have a father-daughter toned conversation with Moonee and ease her into being taken.](#spoiler)

This isn't my favorite of this genre but it's very impressive. At worst, I felt the movie got remarkably slower towards the climax and dragged on until the exact incident that leads to the climax. I feel like the movie could have clocked out at a crisp 90 min.

[Also, it's not really possible for the kids to just walk into Magic Kingdom like that. It's meant to feel like a dream. The way it's filmed. The camera angle. The music. The editing. It departs visually from the rest of the film for a reason.](#spoiler)  

[Plus, on the practical side: It's not really possible to film in the actual park. But it was necessary to have some part of the film there because the connection between Magic Kingdom and The Magic Castle is too strong and too recurrent throughout the film that it needed to be there at some point.](#spoiler)

As a willingly child free couple, watching the kids get into so much gave us both massive anxiety. Even if you're doing your best to raise a good kid and do what you can, you're sweet innocent child (Jancey) can end up running around with some bad kids, doing things they shouldn't be doing. Obviously the kids don't know what they're doing is so unsavory/illegal but shit like this happens every day. 

I did really enjoy the way the movie shows that everyone has problems. The focal was obviously Hailey but the small things shown give perspective that no matter what shit you're going through, everyone else has their own problems. The father taking his boy to New Orleans, Bobby telling his son not to send his gratitude and recoiling when he still needs help because no one else is going to get that ice machine moved.

The entire movie I was just shaking my head at the way their lives have ended up and it's just all really sad. The end had when the daughter was gonna be taken away had me sobbing uncontrollably. Excellent movie about a slice of life. The only questionable part was the end when the happy music comes on and they run to Disney World.

Felt very realistic and relatable even though I haven't been in exact situations. So I guess I could feel the Human element, the struggles we all face mild or strong. 

Comparing to another film wanting to be realistic, this 100% nailed it while I, Daniel Blake I felt while did feel realistic lost it in the story phase due to some clichés. Such as what happens to both main characters in that. But in this it felt natural. 

I loved the sudden jarring ending as the camera turned choppy and we had a musical score as Moonie was taken by the hand by her friend and they ran to Magic Kingdom.

It reminded me greatly of that other great kid's POV film 'Beasts of the Southern World' but with a more earthly aesthetic. It similarly handles the joys of childhood innocence and combines it with the less than ideal circumstances, and the very adult situations the kids find themselves in. 

It's a beautiful film to watch. The script is so naturalistic, the humour derived so naturally and balanced with its darker aspects perfectly. 

The performances are all great, especially Brooklynn Prince and Willem Dafoe in William Dafriend mode, who I'm sure will be awarded come Oscar season. This Bobby is worlds apart from ol' Bobby Peru.

What a haphazard, meandering, and stale insult to story telling. There was no story, there were no events, there was no character development, there was no arc, and there was no plot. It was just kids playing for 2 hours. We didn't get to know the kids, their friendships were lazily portrayed, they barely talked to each other, and that was the entire movie. Kids are more interesting than that. 

Am I supposed to be impressed because they portrayed poor people? Is that all you have to do now? Mindless and exhausting  shots of a degenerates kid playing with an occasional reference to how horrible the mother is? No direction as to how she got there, to who she was, to why she came to be, nothing? How the fuck did this get the reviews it did?

100% agree with you. The best scene of the ""Halley becomes a prostitute"" storyline was the confrontation with the tourist John.

It was surreal watching this movie tonight. It was almost as if there was a camera on me and my friends. So many of their conversations were the same that we had. When they were walking near the field with a pond near it my head said “careful, there are alligators in there.”  The kid then said “you know, there are alligators in there.”  I laughed so hard because ‘little me’ had that same conversation so many times. 

To further the closeness this movie got to my heart, this hotel is right down the road from where my grandfather lived when I was a teen. I know that strip so well. In fact, I lived there with him for the summer when I was 17 while I worked at Disney. 

So this movie brought me back to two very important stages of my life. I was fortunate that my mother was so better equipped than Halley. But damn, this hit so close to home. ",7c5s8i

My mom occasionally brings up how much we struggle back them. But I don’t remember any of that. Watching this movie was almost magical for me. The mom struggles so much, and arguably she shouldn’t be taking care of her kid, but Moonee seems so happy. She’s unaware of the world around her, and she makes the best out of every day. The scenes with the baths projects their situation so much. Oh, and that ending when the harshness if the world catches up to Moonee is devastating. ",7c5s8i
dpno87v,"> Halley is one of the best antiheroes of the year so far, along with Connie from Good Time.

I think it's very difficult to call her an ""antihero.""  I don't think her more ""negative"" attributes are presented for judgment to the audience, it feels like Sean Baker's first priority is to create a realistic person - and whether that person can be seen as divisive or an antihero is an afterthought.  In this case the person is a young single mother who clearly doesn't have any other means of support (no family mentioned).

Also, the ""terrible things"" she does only start around midway through the film, when the financial pressure really kicks up.  In the beginning she's depressed because she can't get a new job - ""I've got my application in every joint up the strip"" - and even brags how she won't turn tricks like other girls.  Then as the film goes on, she finds it harder to make money and then her main support system - her best friend - rejects her after Moony and her friend start the fire.  Halley loses her one companion that could spot her lunch or rent money, and she doesn't even understand why - she just sees it as another betrayal.  Confused and unsure of what to do, she begins doing what she said she wouldn't - sex work.  Yeah, she steals that guys' Disney passes but that also means less sex work for her.

Anyways, I just think the film is far more complex than moralizing about her.  This is a person - like many - who's been fucked over by many different systems and doesn't have a family to fall back on.",7c5s8i
dpnynst,">That scene with the herons had to have been improvised. They must have wandered on set and Sean Baker and William Dafoe just started rolling.

dtduo2i,"Thanks. I totally did not connect with this movie and left it feeling kind of nothing. I felt like I just watched a bunch of scenes and then it ended.Perhaps it's because before that I already saw The Post, The Shape of Water and I, Tonya and I had just been sitting in the cinema for too long. And these three movies all had a clear plot. So my mindset was probably set to that after those movies. 

At least I understand what others like about it after reading your post. I felt unsure if this was supposed to tell me something about how some kids grew up, because despite all the shit, the kid seemed happy. It hadn't really crossed my mind to see her as a resilient kid instead of a happy kid. 

>The film never looks down on the inhabitants of the motel, I didn't feel for a second that this movie was telling me ""Ohhh look at these poor people"", it rather objectively observes them, it almost feels like a documentary.

I absolutely recognize this. I feel like this helped with my confusion though. I guess I was just not in the mood for a movie that let me form my own opinion to this extent, instead of telling me what I'm supposed to see.

I did not really feel any sympathy though for hailey.  I get that her character was probably a product of terrible upbringing and she was dealt a bad hand in life. And that sucks. But she was god awful terrible. It was soul crushing to see her raise moonie that way. Her neighbors in a similar situation were easier to sympathize with. In a similar financial situation but trying - working, raising their kids as best they can. I thought the point of the movie was just this vicious cycle of hailey being raised that way and moonie destined for the same fate. The ending with child services was heartbreaking for the child to lose her mother but also a way to break the cycle as difficult as separating the two would be and I sympathized to that scene in particular. But the cut to Disney world was so jarring and so outta left field from what the movie had built up to the point that I was just totally taken out of it. Like cutting it black after moonie crying would've been a more appropriate ending. I didn't need this weird surreal ending to feel hopeful.

I think that's when she realized she just couldn't do it. The next few scenes were her cleaning up the hotel room, giving way her pot, and taking Mooney for that last stolen  feast at the fancy hotel. She knew what was coming and wanted it to happen.

dpt9bfw,"> The film constantly puts him in a situation where he helps out Mooney, so it was pretty surprising to see how passive he was during the whole social service scene at the end.

Because he is a failure.  I love this movie because every character is complex and imperfect and flawed.  Even Moonnee compromises her friends and gets Scooty into trouble.  

Bobby is a failure when it comes down to it, just less dramatic as Halley.  They are both trying to constantly put out fires best they can, neither is actually making progress.  Bobby tries to help everyone at the motel, yet his own relationship with his son is strained and he goes ballistic over the mom thinking he may have said Happy Birthday.  That immediate anger is very similar to Halley's hair trigger temper.  You can imagine he was much like her when he was Halley's age towards his wife and kid. And they both try to cover up decay with the idea of happiness, him with the paint and Halley with buying sparkly headbands and bangles.  And they both find moments of joy, Bobby speaking to the birds, Halley dancing in the rain.  

But they are failures.  When it is most important he shuts down,  Halley explodes.  And with Bobby, it is even more apparent when he walks away to smoke and tells the woman that he will have the dryer fixed that week and she just looks at him with that, ""Yeah, you've been saying that all month"" look. He can't even fix a dryer.  And that is Halley's future.  Without her kid, possibly a bit more settled but still always just trying to catch up and never making it.  Trying to be a mother figure to the people around her because she couldn't to her own kid, but ultimately neither actually knows how to fix things.

I felt they had literally run away, but I saw it as an image of abject futility and it made it even more sad to me than if we had seen her be taken. To me it was trying to escape sadness by running towards ""the dream"", when the audience knows that there's no point. Life is about to catch up with them and what's actually going to happen to them is the opposite of ""the dream"".

The camera zooms out and shows a fallen tree that the girls are sitting on. At first I thought maybe it symbolizes Halley, who despite ""being fallen"", is trying to grow and being good mum to her daughter.

dsmbl77,"I don’t think the director was trying to make a PSA about the struggles of the poor. He was depicting one child’s story. For me, the disaster of the mom’s life and Moonee’s ability to still find joy and pleasure in the world says a lot about the resilience of children. 

I work with the homeless, including some families and people who, like Halley, make poor choices again and again. There are many reasons the make those choices, the most common being having few life skills because of the ways they were raised. A history of extreme abuse and neglect can make one constitutionally unable to care for oneself, let alone a child. People also have untreated mental illness, history of head injury, even low IQ/ cognitive delay. I feel like ALL of my patients who are chronically homeless (and living in a motel counts as homeless) have at least one, sometimes all, of these challenges.

Some people are hardwired to rise above a rough childhood, others aren’t born that way. There’s no obvious reason why sometimes.

I think it’s important to see that the mom, for all her flaws, loved and protected her daughter. Halley was careless, but she was also fun, sweet, and took real pleasure in Moonee. She was a good a mother, and as good as she could be. That doesn’t mean that Moonee shouldn’t have been removed. That is the tragedy.

The ending isn't catharsis, it's just showing something that Moonee will never experience. That's how I thought about it when leaving the theater, which is probably why I didn't feel like it was some happy cop out, but rather a depressing chunk of happiness that sweet kid will likely never get because of the circumstances she was born into.

I don't think the movie picked up and got more interesting until the end.  Ninety-nine percent of the movie consists of a series of scenes of Halley, the children, and Bobby doing similar things.  Halley engages in shady activities.  The children run around and get into mischief.  Bobby manages the motel.  So what?  There is no story.  After establishing the characters and the situation, the movie never gets off the ground.

It does seem like there isn't a lot of plot, but I would say the plot elements that do occur would make a huge impact on a child. She gets told she can't see her best friend anymore, she has to move out of her home, her mom gets taken away, she gets to see a pair of boobs, etc. Those are huge things for a child. I'm not the first to say this, but one of the things I really appreciated about this film is how it made the kids truly seem like kids. It didn't do the whole ""kids that act like adults"" thing that Hollywood is obsessed with. Since kids don't typically talk a lot or have a lot of substance in their lives, this movie is more subtle in the way it shows the kids' actions and how things going on around them affects them. But you do see the kids affected by things happening in the film, for instance when the kid who starts the fire in the house is clearly shaken by it, and obviously the emotional climax with Moonee at the very end. I think this movie does an incredible job of portraying a slice of this child's life. It's a stark depiction of a segment of the population that isn't often represented on film, and it shows how decisions that would be easy for most people are very difficult and have life-changing implications for these characters. I also think Sean Baker is an extremely creative filmmaker. It's a hyper-realist movie, but it still manages to transport the viewer to a totally different world.

dusonhv,"I actually believe it was Ashley, Scooter’s mom and Halley’s former friend. The way the DCFS showed up after Halley beat Ashley wasn’t coincidentally.  A few other possible clues:

- Right before the beat down, Ashley shows Halley a picture she found of her sex ad on the internet. Later on the DCFS tell Halley “they found her ad on the internet,” which Ashley probably gave them.
- When Ashley leaves for work and goes down the stairs, the way Halley stares her down from the balcony was like “I know it was you”.
- When Moonee goes to say goodbye to Scooter he says something like “my mom says  you’re going to another family,” leading me to think Ashley told him before they even knocked on their door.
- After the scene with the guy and the magic bands and Bobby’s confrontation with the guy, he basically acknowledges why the guy was there (for prostitution) and that’s why tells Halley she needs to check in all visitors (“special rule for you”) to try to discourage her from continuing. The security footage was probably given up because he was forced to do it by DCFS.

Maybe I’m way off, but Bobby had many chances to turn her in before (I mean she had like 9 dudes come into her room at different times). Since he was always this paternal figure to Halley, I don’t think he would have the heart to split Halley and Moonee up.

And that’s what makes it so heartbreaking at the end when he just sort of hides away to smoke a cigarette and avoid the situation - he knows he enabled Halley and this ending was inevitable.",7c5s8i

dpoavzm,I think that's the point of the last sequence. It is such a contrast to the rest of the movie because it's not real. The whole movie is grounded and based in their harsh reality but that last sequence is just a wild daydream in the mind of Moonee. I understand why you didn't like it but to me that scene really showed the contrast between her life and all the kids that come through her hometown with their happy families. ,7c5s8i
dpob2v9,"Exactly, I was also thinking top 5 films of the year while watching it but the last minute was just bad. I think the way it ended was not the problem but the way it was executed and shot. I understand the director wanted to make it dream-like or fantasy-like but the way it was shot was so jarring and contrasting to the rest of the movie that it completely took me out of the movie and made the ending feel cheap, along with the choice of background music. But Willem Dafoe, the mother, and the little girl were great and could possibly get nominations at the end of the year.",7c5s8i
dslwfiv,"She was put in a situation that's incredibly hard to get out of, and she was raised by people who acted just like she does. One of the reasons this movie is so good is because it encourages people to use their sociological imagination. 

If you look at the statistics about this you find that poverty like this is a generational trend that a vast majority of people succumb to. 

This isn't the case in countries with higher upward mobility, namely European ones where companies like Disney aren't allowed to just roll in and fuck over people in the area

I'm not saying she didn't make bad choices, she definitely did. I just know that if you or I grew up in similar situations we would probably be very similar to her. Not only because of impoverishment but also in the way she was raised: uneducated, and without proper norms due to the norms she grew up with.

She clearly did not grow up with good parenting herself, because she reacts to everything like a child throwing tantrums and screaming. She interacts with Moonee more as a kid than as a parent and you know she'd rather be doing nothing all day rather than taking responsibility. That's why she worked well off the woman downstairs which was more responsible and more of a parent to her child. I can feel empathy for Halley because it's clear she's a product of a failed system and tragically Moonee is going to end up being exactly like her mom if she isn't taken away.

Halley knew the gig was up after that, which is why she took Moonee running out in the rain, and then for a big dinner. The gig was up, she was getting arrested and she knew it.

Based on what Scooty said (""you're going to another family!"") his mom def called the cops and social services. Bobby also definitely gave the cops access to the security footage, but likely he had no choice about that-- they can get a warrant, probably. He really did care for Moonee and could he really allow Halley to prostitute herself out of that hotel he was running, when he knew damn well Moonee was around?

It's just a screwed up moral dilemma for Bobby, who really is a good hearted person. That scene of Moonee crying at Jancy's door. Damn. I got something in my eye. Can't stand seeing little kids crying like that, and the actress killed it. Do the ever nominate kids that little for Oscars? ",7c5s8i
dq1argt,"Thanks for the reply. 

I think the kids name is Scooty. Yeah, his mom did call social services the first time and I think that’s why she felt they came again but I think it was the follow up from Bobby that brought the full - take the kid- team. Can’t really know for sure until you talk to Sean Baker but the way Bobby was acting at the end felt out of character. Later when I was thinking about it this seemed to make sense.

duby3yx,"This movie and especially the characters definitely aggravated me but I guess that's the realism for ya. I didn't feel like the movie was celebrating Halley at all though - more like just observing her. It was obvious that she was both a shitty person and a shitty parent. The only obvious positive I saw the movie portray about her was that she loved her kid. But having love for your kid and being a shitty person/parent can happen simultaneously.    

> never blame the child before you take a look at the parents

I totally felt that way too, but something funny while I was watching. The scene where Halley takes Moonee out to play in the rain, I distinctly remember thinking, ""They're both just kids."" Your comment reminded me of that.",7c5s8i

We do know, however, that she's an adult who never accepts personal responsibility and lashes out when things don't go her way. Sure, she's young and attractive so she has that going for her, but take that away and there simply aren't any excuses for her faults. She is actively putting her kid in danger.

It's a movie so we want character growth and some redeeming quality, but as someone who works with a lot of poor people who make bad choices, I see tons of people who never learn (whether started by their parents or on their own) and who never go anywhere.",7c5s8i

Also to note here that Disney is everywhere in the film, but also subliminally when Moonee and her friends play. Such as in the abandoned house, a representation of haunted mansion.

It's a surreal, fantasy sequence that isn't as realistic as the rest of the film that preceded it. 

Your interpretation of the ending is more strictly logical than mine. Because we're seeing a thing that isn't realistic, you look for a logical, realistic explanation for seeing what we're seeing. ""It's in their mind at this point."" That's a valid interpretation, but it's one that I find a little unsatisfying.

dppyu2o,"I think this is what I meant by 'stoic' to be honest - I agree with you that the circumstances of their lives means they have to take a certain perspective. I suppose what I'm thinking is that even for those who in real life take that perspective, the distress leaks out somewhere and somehow. It's not that they're not feeling distressed, it's that they try to put it out of their minds. But people in real life don't completely manage it and the signs come through. Especially for a 6 year old, they won't have totally mastered this yet. So for me - and this is just an opinion - I just wanted to see more leakage. It wouldn't need to be anything major at all. Just a line of dialogue here and there or the odd moment to show a little of what lies underneath. I wouldn't have liked it to be heavy handed. But I guess yeah, because the stakes 'felt' quite low for me during the middle of the film I couldn't stay engaged. A teensy bit more emotion on screen I think probably would have given me the feeling of stakes.

ED: A good example of this would have been the scene where Haley stamps on the floor. That was well-played I thought. Sure, she's not going to start crying or something, but she does still feel hard done by so she finds a way to get revenge. So that kind of thing.

Yes, which was done horribly. It was lazy and scattered and showed us nothing about that child. Thanks for clarifying that she is a child.

>It does seem like there isn't a lot of plot, but I would say the plot elements that do occur  

Pretty sure you are proving my point. 

> but I would say the plot elements that do occur would make a huge impact on a child. She gets told she can't see her best friend anymore, she has to move out of her home, her mom gets taken away, she gets to see a pair of boobs, etc.  

That is my point. They are randomly littered throughout the movie. The only significant thing that happens is at the end. Nothing lead to it. It was just flat and lame right up to the end.  Kids have more depth than that. So should their characters. 

>I'm not the first to say this, but one of the things I really appreciated about this film is how it made the kids truly seem like kids. It didn't do the whole ""kids that act like adults"" thing that Hollywood is obsessed with. Since kids don't typically talk a lot or have a lot of substance in their lives, this movie is more subtle in the way it shows the kids' actions and how things going on around them affects them.  

It was two hours of this meandering nonsense. I am not advocating for them to act like adults. 

>I think this movie does an incredible job of portraying a slice of this child's life 

It shows uninteresting and meaningless events for the entire movie. You can show the carefreeness of a child's day without exhausting ti for 2 hours.

I disagree. The portrayal of that area of Orlando was done well but I think the camera use was distracting and poorly executed.

She's so angry at that point and has literally *nobody* helping her anymore so she cracks and hurts somebody who she feels like betrayed her.

It's a last joyous grasp for Moonie's quickly ending childhood. 

But it's a temporary escape. The Magic Kingdom is a magical fairytale, but we know it ends. The park closes at night. Moonie will be taken away by CPS.

Up to that point, she'd been really lucky that Bobby, Jancy's mom, and a bunch of other people had been looking out for her, but eventually, that house of cards had to come down. 

To me it was just a slice of life-- a crappy, poverty-stricken deadbeat life. No message. Just that there are a lot of kids living on the edge, and that's what one of them's life looks like.

This necessitates a stronger fantasizing on her part to deal with the pain. All throughout the movie we see Moonee's childlike wonder and innocence in the midst of their living situation.

I got the feeling she was vaguely aware of her mother's dealings, or at least that her mom isn't what a normal mom usually is. But it was peripheral to her because she was off exploring with her friends. When the agents come for her, it's hard to look at that moment of clarity and realization on such a young person.

Now, the girls could act, but they were too clean compared to real homeless kids in situations like that.

A movie is plot? Not at all. Mainstream movies might be about that, but a FILM is not necessarily about getting a character from A to B. In the real world, people simply exist.

You said the film shows us nothing about the child...except for the fact that the father isn't around, she doesn't respect authority, she leads other kids astray, her mother is a prostitute, she knows how to scam people out of money for ice cream, she learned this from watching her mother scam money out of people, she doesn't know she's poor, she loves her mother despite her mother being a terrible parent, she's being taken away, she'll probably end up like her mother.

I'd argue everything that happens to her is a significant event because that will shape her as an adult. We don't need to see her grow up to find out what happens, it's up to you to think about what you've seen and discuss the possible outcomes.

I didn't need that scene of her breaking down in front of Bobby telling her the epic tragic story of her life. I can infer it through action and through character. You seem to clearly just want a different kind of film than this is. Not every film has to blatantly spell out every story beat directly to you. Humans don't do that themselves, we only do it in film for efficiency sake. If a director can imply without telling that's amazing. It's not lazy, it's magical. I'm sorry you didn't connect with it but you're vitriolic attacks on it aren't going to clear anything up. You're trying to fit a round peg into a square hole. This isn't a film where we have a lazy flashback to her past and then cut back to her looking sad at Mooney. It's about living in the world, a slice of life of a unique experience. If it's not for you fine, but it seems pretty silly to demean it because it doesn't fit in your narrow view of cinema. ",7c5s8i

dpnjf1b,"> A movie is plot? Not at all. Mainstream movies might be about that, but a FILM is not necessarily about getting a character from A to B. In the real world, people simply exist.

I didn't say set a determination of how a plot has to be delivered. Either you are telling a story or you are not. Nothing was communicated well in this movie. People make the mistake of suggesting that pointing out what the movie is lacking means I want it filled with cliche hackneyed nonsense. That is just dishonest. 

>In the real world, people simply exist.  

Yeah. That is not a story. We tell stories about the significant parts of these moments of existence.  We also want to find the humanity in the characters living these experiences. This movie does nothing to communicate this. 

>except for the fact that the father isn't around, she doesn't respect authority, she leads other kids astray, her mother is a prostitute, she knows how to scam people out of money for ice cream, she learned this from watching her mother scam money out of people, she doesn't know she's poor, she loves her mother despite her mother being a terrible parent, she's being taken away, she'll probably end up like her mother.  

I appreciate what you are saying but you are proving my point. This is not who the child is. These are all haphazard and shallow happenings that are exhausting for 2 hours. I do think her love for her mother was communicated well. 

>I'd argue everything that happens to her is a significant event because that will shape her as an adult. We don't need to see her grow up to find out what happens, it's up to you to think about what you've seen and discuss the possible outcomes.  

There is no substance there. What will? There was no growth, there was no decline, there was no development, there was no anything. Just randomness connected to nothing. I can make all kinds of assumptions about her future because we were given nothing. 

>What do you class as meaningful events?  

Good question. Anything that shows depth to a character. Anything that highlights the humanity. Something that connects me with the character. I can give you examples but I am not in the mood to rewrite the script! 

>I'd say burning down a house or listening to her mother fuck a guy for money or just be a kid meaningful.

When you think about Halley not ""deserving"" her kid, you have to think about Moonnee too, because she probably would have ended up a lot like her mother if not for DCFS.  The cycle tends to continue from one generation to the next.  I think that DCFS stepping in was what broke the cycle (hopefully, although god knows that the foster care system can really destroy a child's life too).  All I'm saying is that Halley might be Moonee in the timeline where DCFS wasn't called.  I think we can agree that while Moonee was mischevous, she was by no means a bad person, just a troubled kid.  Her mom wasn't a bad person and we don't know what kind of life she had until the point she was at, but from my perspective, she was just a troubled adult.

If she had walked in, been polite, even while complaining, I doubt she would have gotten refused service that way. That's how Halley is-- no manners, no class. You get the sense she, like Moonee, lacked a proper upbringing. How old could she possibly be? The actress is 25, and her daughter is 7. I don't think it was really about ""how she looked."" Had she been all, ""Yes, please, thank you, sorry m'am, can I call my friend Bobby to confirm our prior arrangement?"" it would have gone down differently.

But such language is not in Halley's repertoire and never has been, so that scenario could never happen. Lack of impulse control or the ability to code switch screws over a lot of people. It's a sad story. That's why I'm torn on the end. Felt SO bad for  Moonee, but at the same time, if she somehow gets with a family that takes good care of her, and/or Halley gets her act together, she'll have a much better chance in life. 

Eh, the whole situation is screwed. Such a depressing and amazing movie.",7c5s8i

dt3phyf,"I find this baffling. I don't agree with you because I think your opinion in missing things. So your reasoning doesn't make sense to me. If people learn interactions that aren't productive, you're claiming they can NEVER learn how to interact positively in society? Or that it's ""not their fault"" that they behave badly, but someone else. Again, this undermines the entire American philosophical underpinning, that individuals have free choice and must deal with the consequences of those choices. It undermines the prison/justice system as well. Because you're saying a criminal isn't really guilty of the crime, or at least, not 100% responsible. And that his parents, or lack of them, should also be held culpable for the crimes their child (even at 25 years old, or 45) commits? This is insanity. At some point in every human beings life, society MUST say that they must be held accountable for their own actions. Being ignorant of the full spectrum of choices is not an excuse of the bad behavior.  Receiving negative feedback from society (i.e. punishment in school, the law ) is the lessons that a person either learns or doesn't. It either gets them to modify their behavior or it doesn't. And there will come a day when Moonie would be held accountable for her own actions as well, despite a ""bad"" mothering, society must  treat actions from individuals.  What you're saying is that if Moonie was say 28 years old and smokes crack and then starts a fire that kills 3 people in the apartment building, her MOTHER should be charged with murder???  Seriously? Again, if a child is taught to steal and kill, and then grows up to be a killer and a thief should society be gentle with the criminal adult ? Is a person who kills and was only taught to kill at a young age a ""good"" person? No. Of course not. Bad people do bad things. Good people DON'T do bad things. ",7c5s8i

I really thought the movie sucked though so I give people a hard time who try to defend it.  I hope I didn’t hurt your feelings.   I reflected my hate for this movie inappropriately and I acted like a complete dick.  My anger should have been completely at these guys who made it.  I have to remind that they are indie art film makers. I used to work at NBC Universal for a long time and for my first movie experience, our team worked with Brian Grazer on A Beautiful Mind (I was only an intern at the time), but I think that was a decent movie compared to A Florida Project, which I just don’t feel is Academy worthy with a plot involving kids spitting on cars and no plot.  We knew she would have Social Services take her away.  The writing was not rich, deep, but most of all, not inspiring, (almost like leaving no hope for people in a similar situation).  Films used to be more positive and in a time with Trump, a questionable economic future for the middle class, and so many other world issues that give people fear, hope and happy endings need to be produced again. None of this depressing shit because it makes people even more depressed.  I majored in music theory and film editing at SC, but I loved studying psychology and wrote a lot of papers on the psychology of film and how it affects people in real life.  

I was just over at Pixar Studios on Friday watching my friend do the music editing on Incredibles 2. We were roommates at USC and we have a company that does live music concerts for Star Wars and many other classic movies with Symphonies around the US and Europe so my passion for good movies runs deep.  Incredibles will be a decent movie.  My friends and I had a discussion about what we all thought of a Florida Project and we all thought it was just so different from what was created 10 years ago. A lot of these Hollywood films right now are so dramatic and depressing on purpose.  Not my style. Ok, have a good day.  Sorry again, ok? 👍😉",7c5s8i
dt3ub37,"I think I might have misrepresented my point here again. I'm definitely not trying to make it sound like people who commit crimes don't deserve punishment. I'm not trying to say that anyone's mother should be held guilty for the crimes of their offspring.  However, there does exist a cycle. If a person lacks the capacity to see that their actions are negative for society, how can they make that choice?  Yes, when they are 25 they should know better. But the problem is that many times, they don't. To me, this means that they could have been reached and the cycle could have been broken. I'm saying that DCFS needed to step in, and it's good that they did because now Moonee has a better chance of growing up in a way that will benefit society. However, if she had been raised by her mother, there's a high probability that she would have had the same behaviors and not had the self awareness to know how bad her actions were.  I'm compassionate for Halley even though she makes bad choices, and even though I agree with you that she should be in jail and that she shouldn't have kids. Your perspective is that she should take responsibility and know better. You also brought up that it sounds like I'm trying to say that people in that situation can't learn. You also said that my perspective undermines the justice system. Tying all those points together, maybe we can say that the best case scenario is one where Halley learns a better way to be. I'd say the US prison system will punish her for her crimes but she'll come out no better than she was before. I say that she's fundamentally a good person trying desperately to provide for her child and making recklessly stupid choices in the process. Not a bad person even though she's a criminal who needs to be treated as such. Maybe if the prison system rehabilitated Halley instead, it would help her become a more competent and successful person. ",7c5s8i

It's not like she's willfully ignoring the good options and picks the bad options because they fit her selfish needs better. At least that's not the impression I got.

Being a ""terrible adult"" implies she is a ""bad"" person. Now, can she change? Maybe, who knows, but until she makes ""good"" actions, she isn't a good person. 

What you're trying to say is she is a good person doing bad things. Or a good person trapped inside a bad life. Or whatever strange twisted excuse.  The reality is, 99% of us think we are ""good"". we justify our bad actions with rationalizations to help us continue.

Just because I don't want to assume she is a bad person, doesn't mean I think she is a good person. Not being good doesn't mean you're bad and not being bad doesn't mean you're good. I define bad person differently than you. Which should be obvious from the fact that I don't equate being a terrible adult to being a bad person, whereas you do. But I think I understand where you're coming from. I mean, if I would only put people in either a 'bad person'-label or 'good person'-label, I might be inclined to put her in the former category either. I just think there is more than these absolutes. In my opinion there are good sides and bad sides to people. I personally think it's preferable to look at people in this way, because once we start looking at people as simply good or bad, it becomes very easy for us to do bad things to bad people. Which in turn would make us bad people. Or at least it may prevent someone from caring enough for someone to help them and focus on the punishment instead.

If we assume what you're saying is correct, then the flipside is that a serial killer, could be just a good person too. Just because they murder people doesn't make them all bad does it? 

I think that people aren't ""inherently"" good or bad. It's only their actions that matter.  IF you do harm to people, you're bad. It's simple. If you help people, you're good. simple again.  But let's say that , in trying to help people in their lives, you end up destroying them, again and again, are you  a good or bad person?
