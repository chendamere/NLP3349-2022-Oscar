* ""*Sleeeeeeep*""
* The animation and montage when Miles creates the suit and swings through the city the first time

-all the voice actors for the supporting Spider-People were fantastic, Nic Cage and John Mulaney were especially perfect.

So many things to say about that movie.

&#x200B;

Did *anyone* ever expect to be getting *anything* like this when the trailers dropped last year?

Gorgeous visuals, *great* use of music to heighten these characters. (When I heard Big Poppa arrive for Uncle Aaron, it caught me off-guard with its abruptness.)

Speaking of: this movie actually feels like the stakes are real.  And the fact that they *did* that with all of this space time continuum nonsense is a miracle. I was never concerned about the possibility of a Thanos snap being erased here, the stakes felt real.

And it was properly brutal, which I was pleasantly surprised to see for a PG rated film. They don’t really hold back all that much here. Kingpin literally *kills* the original Spider-Man of Miles’ world.

And the Uncle Aaron as *Prowler* reveal? Hooboy. My heart sank for Miles.

Let’s talk about *badass Aunt May!*

That. May. Be. My. Single most. FAVORITE. Version of her.

No more platitudes, no more being elderly and almost completely defenseless. THIS version is incredible.

I could write a book with how much I loved this movie…it’s *absurd.*

Film of the year. ",a5yi33

ebqk4v1,"2018: the year they killed Peter Parker twice.

* The animation style may not be for everyone but I really dug it.

* There were *so many* Easter eggs and inside jokes, both Spidey ones (like the PS4 suit) and non-Spidey ones (like ""From Dusk Till Shaun""). I'll rewatch this just to see all the hidden details. Seriously, I could talk for an hour about all the homages and references.

* Loved all the Spiders. Miles was fantastic, both Peters were great, Gwen was perfect. I want a whole movie of Spider-Man Noir being dark and gritty: ""Sometimes I watch matches burn until they touch my fingers just so I can feel again."" And fucking Spider-Ham, man...

* I don't watch a lot of animated movies, but I liked that they didn't shy away from death. Peter's death actually got a little jump scare from me.

There's *so much* crazy shit in this movie, but somehow it all flows together and doesn't interfere with Miles' story. In fact, the strength of Miles' story is what glues the film together. Absolutely loved this movie. I take back everything I've ever said about Sony. A+",a5yi33
ebqk6p1,"Genuinely one of the best films I've seen this year, and certainly one of the most visually striking ones I've seen in a while.

I couldn't help but just feel so impressed by the animation and how it looked, yet I couldn't quite put my finger on how it was made, like it just looked so polished and unique, whilst feeling totally right for the film and in a way that isn't distracting despite it's vibrancy.

And the visuals certainly aren't let down by the writing, every beat in this film felt perfectly placed and escalated in a way that felt natural and built to something truly spectacular.

I know I sound a bit silly enthusing so much about it but I genuinely really, really, loved it, and can't really fault it thinking about it now.

I will continue to enjoy his appearances as long as they last, but I doubt that the Far From Home one will carry as much emotional weight. ",a5yi33

Watch it. Just go watch it. Easily the best animated film I've ever seen and just all-round awesome.

Visuals are comic-style drawings on acid. Right from the intro you know what you're gonna get is awesome.

ebz9cpq,"Phil Lord will get a lifetime pass from me for whatever he wants to do.  Because he understood something about Spider-Man that no other filmmaker up to this point really seemed to understand:

""New York"" is as vital a character to the creation of Spider-Man as any of his respective family members, or villains.  New York informed who he was, and who he would become.  Neighborhoods, and boroughs, and streets.  How the buildings of midtown spread out like a web, and inform the process of traversing the city.  How some areas are simply too far to swing, and how public transit becomes a vital necessity.  The fashions and the people.  The wide exposure to different cultures, the foods and restaurants and smells.  The neon glow at night and the hum of humanity during the day.  The taxis and police officers and everything else.  It was all there, and it MATTERED for once.  New York mattered to the story.

God, I loved this movie.  Everything was just... perfect.  And you cared about Miles so much.  You hurt when he hurt, and you rejoiced when he finally took his leap of faith.

I loved it.  I hope you loved it.  Phil Lord made magic with this movie.

ebqx9o2,"I saw this movie at a test screening back in July - I’m pretty sure our screening was one of the first ones they did. It was torture not being able to share my love for this film for so long. For the curious, here’s all the things I can remember that were different from the test screening: 

- they cut a heart to heart scene between Peter and Miles that happened on a roof - I believe it occurs after Aaron dies but its been awhile so I could be getting the timing wrong. For the life of me I don’t remember exactly what they were saying but I remember being moved by this scene so I was very upset they cut it. It actually kind of affected my viewing experience this time around because I kept waiting for it to come on. I’m pretty sure peter was apologizing for being a shitty teacher and ruminating on his mistakes with MJ but it’s pretty fuzzy in my memory. (Edit: someone in the comments reminded me that this is the scene where Peter says “you don’t have to save the whole world, just focus on saving one person”)

- they also cut a lot out of the sequence where the spider crew sneaks into fisks gala. You know the line where they go “it can’t be that easy”? Yeah, the joke in the test screening was it WASNT that easy because the henchmen basically immediately realize who they are and say something to the effect of “do you think we’re stupid or something? Obviously we’re not gonna fall for the fact that y’all are waiters” I can’t really remember how they end up escaping - miles may have rescued them? I honestly can’t remember though since it’s been so long. 

- Peter porker had a lot of his best lines cut which I was DEVASTATED about because they were some of my favorite parts. There’s a scene where he talks about one of his family members dying and he describes the smell as singed bacon. It’s hard to describe but the shock factor of that line was sooo hysterical. He also says fuck at one point, but it pops up as a bunch of “f*^%#!” symbols in the speech bubble that appears so it’s just implied. 

- the end scene where adult Peter reconnects with MJ wasn’t there, in the test screening I saw it just shows him calling her at the very end. I like this change a lot better because it’s a more satisfying resolution for him. 

- in my test screening almost the entire climax was in storyboards so there’s a ton of stuff they changed from that - but it’s way too many random little things for me to remember. 

If I remember anything else I’ll update this. And if anyone else was in a test screening and remembers that Peter/ Miles scene on the roof, please let me know because it’s killing me that I can’t remember exactly when that scene took place. ",a5yi33

The style/tone felt so fresh for American animation, there was so much energy and fluidity to it. The film has so much momentum but it manages to squeeze in so many heartfelt storylines. 

I loved the references to Maguire's Spiderman at the start and the arcs everyone went through. Stan Lee's cameo was incredibly heartwarming and had me tearing up. 

Everything felt so witty, subversive and perfectly scripted, all the emotional beats land, whether it be Chris Pine's Spider-Man dying, Johnson's Spider-Man being scared to go back to his life, Miles relationship with his Dad and Uncle. It all felt very genuine, hell even Kingpin gets some genuine motivation.

Upon my second and third viewing, I started to appreciate this version more and more. He's just such a *huge* force of nature. I can see this guy giving people two options: fight me or take my money and shut up.

This guy doesn't even try to pretend he's less than a vicious thug. Or at the very least, this *universe* is so extreme that a guy like that can get away with being a legitimate businessman. 

Fisk throwing a Spider-Man gala was a fucking genius move by the writers. I'd love to see how a Daredevil would handle this version of Kingpin.

Even though I thought having him *throw a taxi* was going a little *too* far, the movie gets away with it by having it happen when the visuals turned into armageddon. It helped with the suspension of disbelief. 

His design on paper looks *really* over the top, but it works in the context of the film. I loved the touch of giving him a character tic with the clacking pen. He just felt like such a neurotically dangerous guy.

There’s an incredibly fine line when it comes to going balls-to-the-wall discarding continuity while also keeping things accessible for mainstream consumption, and this movie NAILED it. 

Thrilling, funny, moving, and with some amazingly dark turns I did not see coming, Into the Spider-Verse just had me giddy with excitement. I’m going to write a full review tomorrow, but I have to digest this gem of a film overnight before putting my thoughts down on paper. In 2018, there is a GOOD animated Spider-Man film with Miles Morales, Spider-Gwen, and Spider-Ham. That’s unbelievable to me. Go see it!",a5yi33

Miles said he was better at running than swinging, and I love how his swinging sequence towards the end includes a lot of epic Spider parkour it's so full of attitude, man.

Peni feels kind of thrown in there for the sake of it though (she didn't get as much laughs from me as Noir and Ham, but that's probably personal taste), and I was disappointed to find out some Miles/Peter scenes were cut out.

Jake Johnson's older Spiderman's attempt to get back into form in his own universe would be great and a Nick Cage Noir fighting nazis in a black and white 30s New York could easily be whole films.

Oh my God I was so wrong. This movie left me with the same feeling the original Raimi trilogy did. Everything was exceptional, from the music to the animation. I'm not the biggest Miles Morales fan but this made me appreciate the character even more.  While yeah, it's rated PG but it does have some heavy material and moments. 

\[SPOILER\]

For example, Spider-Man's death kinda hit me hard. I know he's not technically ""our"" Spider-Man but seeing one of your most favorite superheroes go out the way he did hurt regardless. It was also a ""Oh my God I can't believe they just did that in a kid's film"" moment.

Great acting across the board, fantastic story with both action, suspense, comedy and heart, visually stunning with the ability to change animation between styles on a dime.  [If I had one problem it's that the final fight completely abandons any space or reality, but even then that fits with the style of the movie.](#spoiler)






Edit:  Also a great message at the end of the movie about how anyone can be Spider-man.  This movie had a black/latino Spider-man, a female Spider-man, and an Asian Spider-man, and no one seemed to have a problem.",a5yi33
ebqkgw6,"I had pretty high expectations for this one and to be honest they were well met. Actually pretty surprised Sony was able to make something this entertaining, meta, and unique considering their recent rocky past with Spiderman and making good movies in general. There's just a lot that not only really worked for this movie, but also things that allowed it to be surprising and fun for fans and not make it feel restrained or like an MCU movie.

Obviously the visual style is wonderful. The final battle in the collider is some really visually pleasing stuff. The art style is not only unique to animated films, but because of the plot we also get to see styles clash which is kinda cool. The anime style of the DVa spider, the noir style of nic cage spider, and the cartoony style of Porker all side by side with the already unique cell shaded style of the movie. It gave us a lot of fun visual jokes and just kept my eyes entertained.

The plot is also really good. I mean it's run of the mill superhero stuff. Overcoming yourself and taking the reigns of responsibility, loss, bad guy with a sad story, etc. But the multiple dimensions just allowed for some fun jokes and unpredictability. It was really cool to see six spidermen swinging together and fighting together. And because of the one off nature of this movie and visual style the villains could finally be turned up to ten. It makes live action movies feel almost limiting to see such a cool version of Scorpion and such an imposing version of Kingpin.

For fans I feel like this movie has it all. How do you do a one off Spiderman movie when there's so many spiders to choose from? Would focusing on Gwen be looked at as pandering? Would another Peter Parker be too repetitive? Would going in a crazy direction alienate too many viewers? Why not do it all. And it just works. It's fun and good. 

I liked how the movie leaned into its own repetitiveness. Like the ""Alright let's do this one last time"" way to introduce backstories. It almost became a joke by the end but it was such an efficient way to give us the emotional depth of the character. 

Overall, very unique, very fun, and a movie that people will feel impacted by in general. What more can you ask for in animated spider Man. The music and the visuals made it feel very modern in a time when comic book movies are as run of the mill as you can get. This is something special and I hope anyone with an interest in it checks it out. 8/10.",a5yi33

The characters were great, the humor was nicely done, no awkward jokes during serious scenes. The animation was spectacular, the night scenes have to be the most beautiful shots I've ever seen in a movie. Miles' *leap of faith* jump (also in the trailer) was so good! Also, the soundtrack for the movie was fantastic, Miles' playlist was great.

And that Stan Lee cameo and (Steve Ditko) tribute towards the end  was really heartwarming. I can't wait to see it again when it comes out on Blu-ray, the attention to detail in all the scenes was incredible (the text boxes!). SONY finally did it! Stan and Steve would've been so proud.

* Comedy was great. My favorite parts were the whole class hallway scene with Miles and Gwen and the tons of little bits between Miles and Peter.
* The Stan Lee cameo made me tear up a bit.
* I love this film's version of Aunt May.
* I like how this film intentionally tried to avoid common Spider-Man cliches or at least was self-aware of them (Peter cutting off the ""with great power"" quote before Miles can finish it for example).
* I was honestly expecting Peter or Miles' dad to get killed at the end but I'm glad they didn't do that.
* Peni Parker, Spider-Ham, and Spider-Noir each got an appropriate amount of screentime. I was worried they'd go greatly in-depth with these character which would've taken away from Miles' plot.
* Had some pretty good emotional moments like when Peter was about to go back to his universe.

Honestly, I'm still reeling. This is one of the best animated films this decade, in my opinion. The art style and animation were some of the most gorgeous and creative I've ever seen-my only problem with it were some blurry and disorienting scenes and some parts of the fight scenes that got a little too busy and hard to follow. Other than that, it looked absolutely stunning.

The plot and characters were perfect as well. They were all lovable and fun, yet had solid character arcs and touching moments. I loved the older Peter Parker take on Spiderman. 

The humor was fun and felt like it naturally flowed with the movie rather than completely bringing the pacing screeching to a halt like a lot of other superhero films (cough cough MCU).

ecip1lv,"Into The Spider-verse reminds us why we love Spiderman so much, and does so in an original and humane way.

I used to love Spiderman as a kid. I got obssessed with the cartoons he starred in as well as the original movie trilogy, one that actually helped me get interested in the character and marvel as a whole. But my love for this character, as most things, dissolved and it never got around to build itself up again, even after constant remakes and wonderful performances. I never felt that spark again, that love I felt for this charming dude was gone, dead.

Then Into The Spider-verse came, and my whole world turned upside down. I felt a fire inside my stomach. There it was, that long-forgotten love for Peter Parker, one that I thought I would never experience again, expanding continuously as the movie progressed, hitting me in all the right places.

I'd even dare to say that this movie made me understand the reason as to why spider-man is universally loved:

He's an everyday guy with super powers, that's it. He's flawed but pure at heart. He's relatable. He belongs to the people. He's one of us.

This movie's fresh take on Peter Parker is exactly what we needed to fully grasp that, how compelling this character can be without using any of his super powers. This version of Peter Parker is fat, subtly depressed, and tired, yet he's the most charming and lovable version of this character yet. It's something we haven't seen in quite a while, the genuine humanity that makes Peter Parker such a charismatic character, and one can only be thankful for it.

Spider-man is cool again, but in a totally different, and perhaps even better, way. Just your everyday dude taking a leap of faith, giving the audience who relates to his struggles courage to do the same. This is what Spiderman can be and what he should be. A character that's ours, a character that teaches you that anyone can be a hero, that's the real Spiderman. This is the true Homecoming. Spiderman is freaking back! Welcome home!",a5yi33

The characters were all great. I need more of every single Spider-Person.

The animation was beautiful. If the designs weren't enough like something jumping off the page, the strategic use of text boxes and sound effects (*BAGEL*) definitely pushed it over the edge.

The humor was simply the best I've seen in any superhero media. It was genuinely funny, and used at appropriate moments. It even advanced the story ('Do I get to like the haircut now?'). 

Also, when it was about the absurdity of the situation the characters were in, the joke was the characters' reactions to the situation, rather than just pointing out the situation is absurd and undermining the audience's connection to what's going on ('It *can* get weirder!' instead of 'Okay, talking pig' and an eyeroll). I'm looking at you, MCU.

If I have one complaint, it's that the movie could have been longer, or done something different to avoid the fact that the last third sees Gwen and Old Peter sidelined a little to give time to the new Spider-People. They're all amazing, but the time they occupy slows down Gwen and Old Pete's arcs. This makes the resolution to those arcs during the final fight feel a little sudden, like they got stuck in traffic and then had to bomb it down the final stretch to make the end of the film.

[When Gwen comments how neither her or Peter B. taught him the moves in the final battle, I at first thought it showed his natural ability inherently showing.

This movie should be nominated not only for animation, but also for screenplay, soundtrack, even best movie (rather long shot, but if Black Panther is getting the buzz so should better SMISV).

I'm pretty over them at this point but I was so into this one the whole.  I think it was a combo of absolutely beautiful animation that built on a good script.",a5yi33
ecczwpq,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was a legitimately great movie. I feel like the emotional aspect was a lot more involved than in Homecoming, which was a good movie in it's own way, but I just felt so much more invested in all of the characters here. It's easily the best of the non-Raimi movies and is definitely a strong contender with them. The only thing I can even *kind of* knock is that Spider-Ham, Peni, and Noir don't have a ton to do other than moral support, but the plotline is packed enough as it is with Miles and Peter B each having their own pretty involved character arcs on top of stuff their relatives are grappling with, so it's fine that the other Spiders were mostly just there for fun and they do all get some good pretty moments.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the film deserves particular praise for juggling it's huge roster of villians. The general rule with Superhero films (or at least non-MCU ones) is that the more villians there are, the weaker the film is. It's something you see leveled at Spider-Man 3 and some of the 90's Batman movies and those films definitely got dragged down by having so many bad guys, but somehow they made the villian hierarchy really *flow* in this movie without feeling overstuffed. Sure, a good handful of them were just muscle, but Fisk, Doc-Ock, and *especially* Prowler all had some pretty interesting stuff going on, which the film *also* managed to fit in with all the stuff the two main Spider-Men were dealing with.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I loved all the little gags about the different versions over the years. It's kind of expected, especially given it's by the same people who made *The Lego Movie* which had a similar ""deep dive into *everything*"" feel, but I always appreciate that level of effort and love. It was awesome that Fisk looked like the Bill Sienkiewicz rendition and the painted flashback parts with him looked like pages straight out of *Daredevil: Love and War*, so it's neat that they were reaching into Marvel's tapestry even beyond strictly Spider-Man related stuff (though Fisk is of course a classic Spider-Man enemy as well). I loved that they also had the actual music that played during Peter Parker's emo dance, that's some god-tier meme-ing right there.

Sony, *look*, if you're out there, I know we've all said a lot of things about how you guys should give up and quit trying to have your own Spider-Man universe, but it's okay now. *You guys can have your own Spider-Man Universe*, just give me a full length Spider-Man Noir film with Nicolas Cage and we'll be cool.",a5yi33

It's definitely one of the most visually-insane animated movies I've seen, though, and I love it for that. I can't really think of any other animated version of Spider-man that actually looks like a comic book brought to life.

Despite the humor and comic-book visuals, the film does *not* pull its punches when it comes to dramatic or terrifying moments.

Seriously, they took a third-rate villain like the Prowler and made him frightening, with a creepy audio queue that puts your teeth on edge, a lethal power set, and a lot of depth and character you don't expect to see from henchmen.

ebra2pg,"Great movie. Very refreshing to see a new style of animation that looks stunning 99% of the time even if it (very rarely) hurt to watch. I see a lot of people comparing this to the Lego Batman movie but this movie succeeds because it feels more like a love letter to Spider-Man whereas Lego Batman felt like a giant plug for Lego Dimensions.  

Voice acting and humor was on point. Very self aware without reaching obnoxious levels (Deadpool 2). The relationships between the characters were great and it had some nice twists and turns here and there. With this many characters it understood who the focus should be on and we got just the right dose of everyone else without them hamming it up (ha). This movie had many great moments, and some of them were just so well done.   
  
The only things that bothered me were that Kingpin felt a little undercooked. He didn't quite hit that level that earlier Spider-Man movie villains do where you kind of feel sorry for them because we see he's always been evil. I understand he had to have some motivation for his big plan but it could have been done a bit better.

ebtu9aa,"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is groundbreaking, and it does live up to the hype. All the different art style shouldn't work, but it does and feels so natural. All the soundtrack of this movie is unique. 

All the characters have personality and great chemistry between each other. Peter B. Parker and Miles have great arcs in the movie. It never felt crowded instead the focus is on Miles.  

The movie worlding is great because it has a lot of details in its background that we probably didn't notice, which makes it believable. All the easter eggs are great but never distract from the story. 

I feel that there is a sense of danger compared to many modern Animated film from the west. Death is so serious in the movie which is great. 

The Stan Lee cameo made me almost cried. The tribute of him and Ditko was heartwarming. The movie has a heart. 

It is generic to say it but Spider-Verse truly feels like a comic book. The directing of this movie is probably the best direct film of the year. It has three directors but it is consistent throughout the movie. 

The action scenes are fantastic and feel so fresh compared to many actions and blockbuster filmmaking. The cinemaphotography is beautiful. 

I think Spider-Verse is the best film of the year. It deserves to be nominated for best picture. ",a5yi33

* Firstly the writers came at this from a completely ""authentic"" angle, they didn't cater to the mainstream audience, the jokes seemed pretty niche throughout ****looking at you, post-credits scene****
* The animation was absolutely gorgeous, ranging from the over the top comic book *bams* to the picturesque cityscapes and the swings throughout it
* It was a pretty intense story, watching Kingpin kill the main Spiderman was hardcore for a PG rated film. But Miles' story felt earned throughout

Another thing which isn't so much a complaint as a ""i wish they did this differently"" is the way he defeated Kingpin. Rather than the 'shoulder touch' callback I'd have liked it if Kingpin's defeat was a result of his families across all dimensions seeing him choke out Spider-Miles and rejecting him for it. Would have felt a little better to me I think if his own rage sowed the seeds for his ultimate defeat. ",a5yi33

The animation was beautiful and reminded me of a comic book. It was funny but also knew when to be serious. It was so bizarre but it worked perfectly, which is the best compliment I can think of to give it.

I know it's animated, but too many of the MCU films look like the cinematographer fell asleep at the wheel.

Even though this film was animated, it still *looked* better than anything the MCU has ever done from a camera perspective. (Thor Ragnarok and the Guardians films come close)

Each shot looked like wallpaper material. 

Honestly, looking at Captain Marvel in comparison just makes that film look visually pathetic. 

For example, the climatic scene in Spider-Verse where Miles *stares down* into the various web of multi-verses is legitimately gorgeous. 

The CGI while heavy, feels organic and breathtaking to look at.

ecaqxny,"late, but I just went to see this today, already with high expectations and holy crap did it deliver.

From the opening credits and company logos and how those were done with the art style switcheroos, it just buckles you in for the visual trip of this world and how much frenetic and youthful energy it has.

Miles was so relatable as a character and I was happy to seeing his diverse ethnic background represented well and in a natural manner. What just struck me as so cool from the start was the way that the script just conveys that natural and realistic dialogue in all the scenes. Like him listening to sunflowerto the mix of comic book bubbles and then actual dialogue, it was all pulled off seamlessly. 
That's also another factor of where it hit it just right. It fully committed to it being in a comicbook world and with that logic without sacrificing the grounded feeling of actual people talking... that combo is what will just propel this series to stand on its own as a unique thing. 

Furthermore, I loved all the spiderpeople. I will always wish for more time with them but what we got felt quite balanced. I can't wait to see more from the relationship between Gwen and Miles because of the parallels between them as well ( for example their dads both being lawman and so forth) but at the same time differing so much. It'll be exciting to see something bloom in a young romance where they *both* have equal abilities. Can't wait.

Absolutely incredible. Sony knocked it out of the park. I dont know how they did it but i think they might have just revolutionized animation with this movie - this was the best animation i've ever seen. And of course the story, characters, voice acting and music were all solid too. 

Please, go out and see this movie. Im seeing it again too. This kind of masterpiece must not be allowed to flop, because we need more of this. A LOT more.  ",a5yi33

I'm in love with Gwen's design, there are so many minor details like the ballet shoes and the eyebrow piercing, and don't even get me started on that fire haircut. I love it, I love it, I love it all. Honestly have no hype left in me for any live-action Marvel film now, because as this movie demonstrates so vividly, there's sooooooo much more you can do with animation than with live action. This film deserves all the praise in the world. It's such a huge shame that animated films aren't taken as seriously as live action, because I feel like this film beats out almost every mainstream film I've seen in I don't know how long.

I could talk about how great this film is for hours, but it has blown my mind that Sony has shown they are fully capable of playing among the best of the MCU and Disney/Pixar. I honestly think it's the best superhero film since The Incredibles in 2004.

 It actually feels like this film benefitted from all of the Spiderman movies that came before it and fully embraced it. It set out to be completely different from other Spiderman movies but still features the familar characters fans know and love. It's well balanced between emotional and silly, the stakes feel real, the characters are humanized, and the action sequences are a blast. The film is not afraid of exploring violence when the plot requires it. Animation-wise, there's no film I can name that's truly like this one. This goes further with the comic book aesthetic than Scott Pilgrim did and does it wonderfully. I didnt want the film to end, but when it did...the post credits scene is amazing.

I desperately hope at minimum it takes Best Animated Feature at the Oscars. It is a better film than Incredibles 2 on every level. This film sets the bar on superhero films for sure, and sets out to prove that just because it's an origin story, doesn't mean it can't be something complete fresh, too. 

I hope this film leads to many sequels and more stylized, pushing the lengths of the medium animated films in the future. ",a5yi33

It was only a few friends of mine and myself in the theater, but I imagine this would have really shaken any younger audience members. 

&#x200B;

There's one thing I'd really like to mention. When the Prowler got shot dead, I thought it was his own brother who had shot him (I kinda think the movie would have been better this way), but it turned out to be Kingpin. This sort of setup Miles' revenge arc to defeat Kingpin using his uncle's shoulder touch. I'm not sure if this was completely necessary. IMO, Vanessa and Richard going away again should have been enough for Kingpin to sort of defeat himself (a somewhat predictable epiphany, but IMO a Kingpin with character growth > ""hey""). Miles' journey of uplifting Peter B. Parker and gaining the respect and trust of the other Spider-people was a good ending in and of itself. Overall, I really enjoyed Miles' arc/origin story. It may also be the first time I enjoyed Nicholas Cage cast as a hero (and he was Spider-Man!). Liev Schrieber as Kingpin was also awesome! ",a5yi33

The art style and animation are gorgeous (feeling like someone blended comic books, pop art, the *Scott Pilgrim* film and *Jet Set Radio* into one film) and it's one of the most unique audiovisual experiences to come out of mainstream Hollywood for a while. 

It's well-executed, avoiding the usual pitfalls of comic book films (like the tonal problems of pretty much every Marvel film) and it has a sense of energy and kineticism that makes it one of the most entertaining blockbusters in a long time.

I love Miles' story with his family. I love that the Peter/Spiderman in Miles' dimension is essentially the perfect spiderman. 

I enjoyed that it could be inferred that the older Peter Parker/Spiderman was from the same continuity of the Sam Raimi films and then goes onto to grow into a more cynical version of the character.

I really enjoyed the dynamic between Miles and Peter.

I really liked Gwen and how she got along with Miles. It was a nice twist for it to be the same Gwen from the beginning all along.

I really liked the humor, the references, the animation, the dialogue (especially Noir and Spider-Ham), the action.

Favourite Spiderman film I've seen easily and possibly my favourite film of the year.

If I had any minor gripes, I guess Peni was just kind of there as the tech person but I still liked her character and the film did a great job with all 6 spider-people; it is fairly well-established though which are the main 3: Peter, Miles, Gwen and which are more comic-relief: Noir, Peni, Ham so again, very minor thing.

There seems to always be a Spider-person in each dimension that all share the same general story arc. If there was already Peter Parker in Miles' universe, why did he also become a spiderman with the same arc (bit by spider, uncle killed, leap of faith, etc).

Obviously Peter Parker's death in that universe opens up the door for a *new* Spiderman, but considering it's the same dimension why does he have to go through the same experiences.

I haven't enjoyed a Spider-Man movie this much since Spider-Man 2. It is just a sheer joy to watch. Some of my favourite scenes were Miles' Dad breaking down to him through the door, the fight at Aunt May's house and the end credits scene.

Stan Lee's cameo was very poignant too and if this is his last one it will be for the best.

Spider-Man Noir's Rubik's Cube jokes was just an amazing joke, even in the credits.

ebrwhr6,"I adore this movie. I just wanted to list a few things that I love:

The opening intro of Spidey got me on board with the animation and the Chris Pine version of Spidey super fast. I loved that montage.

Miles casually slapping the spider after the dramatic sequence of the bite

Just how pitch perfect Chris Pine’s Spidey was. It makes it all the more tragic when he’s killed, but it was so great seeing Spidey in his prime battling all those villains, making great quips, and even taking time to calmly talk to Miles after saving him.

The prowler and Kingpin are especially terrifying in this movie. The music, their designs, their shear power, I love when I feel like our heroes are in actual danger.

I loved Stan’s cameo. It might be my favorite. “I’m gonna miss him”. It hurts... but it was powerful.

The relationship between Jake Johnson Spidey and Miles is so charming and likable, I wanted so many more misadventures after the one where they encountered doc ock for the first time.

Noir Spider-Man was comedic gold and Nicolas Cage’s line delivery killed me every time.

Even Gwen and Miles’ relationship was sold pretty well. And I loved their team up at the end.

In fact, the entire end battle sequence, was comic bookiness galore. The colors, the constant kinetic energy of their battle arena, and how the fighters used the things flying around to help them in the fight.

Miles getting the suit finally was sooooo satisfying. I always liked Miles’ suit from the comics but seeing it on screen as just so nice to look at it. Especially in contrast to Spider-Gwen’s white costume and regular Spidey’s costume.

The emotional beat between Peter and Miles when he lets him go and Peter says “not bad kid” really got me. It’s this moment of trust where Peter sees Spider-Man and knows he’s gonna do it. I love it. I love it. I love it.

That tribute to Stan and Steve got me big time. What a great quote.

Best. Post. Credits. Scene. Ever.",a5yi33
ebtaojf,"Loving the whole comic book vibe thing going on regarding the Spidey-Sense. Thoughts being louder, world moving slower and a bunch of comic book pop-ups. The style of this movie is beautiful and the villains are great.

+Quick notes here:+

1. Aaron and Miles' relationship is really nice and I like it

2. Anything regarding Kingpin. He is just a fucking boss in this movie. 

3. Spider-Noir confused of the Rubik's Cube and Peni Parker being her adorable self, both are equally good. 

4. Female Doc Ock leaves me both aroused and scared. You could say... scaroused (and R34 will prevail).

5. Will Mary Jane ever get her bread at table 14? Also, Gwen is there, watching and being annoyed/weird about it. 

6. I love how supportive Peter is with Miles. He works so well as a mentor, even though he sucks at it. Just to show that Peter does in fact enjoy being Spider-Man, even though that job ruined his life in more ways than one.

Best Spider-Man movie yet. 
10/10 so many spiders",a5yi33
ecdhav5,"#wow

This is absolutely the biggest surprise of 2018 to me. 

I have to admit when I first saw the trailer for this I thought it was unnecessary and pandering. Did we *really* need another Spider-Man movie? Oh look how inclusive we are, we have a black/mexican Spider-Man, we have a Spider-Woman, fuck it we even have animal and anime representation lol. I'm so happy I couldn't have been more wrong. Inject more of this level of quality of Spider-Man straight into my veins. Fuck it make 5 Spider-Man movies a year if they're all this good. Okay obviously I'm speaking in hyperbole but **wow**

Probably the most imaginative animated movie I've seen in years. There was so much thought and detail put into this. Everything is consistent and has a purpose. Despite being PG it manages to comically succeed for a wide range of audiences. They break the 4th wall without being redundant or tryhard about it. It's very self-aware.

This felt so fresh in a rotting genre. It being animated helps it be more creative, but the animation is surely unique and perfectly fits the mood. Not too cartoonish and not overly realistic either, and everything has a satisfying sheen and polish to it.

All of the character's story arcs were wrapped up nicely, although admittedly the 3 extra spider characters could probably be removed from the script completely and not much would change. Obviously it does help bolster the multiverse theme though; while also adding some more comedy. They don't distract from the main characters and were used just the right amount.

Like many of you Spider-Man has always been my favorite hero. This felt like such a labor of love, a well crafted passion project. It doesn't feel like it was solely created to just be pushed out to the masses to sell more toys. I honestly liked this even more than Homecoming. After having seen Aquaman, this was like eyebleach and a reminder as to why superhero movies have gotten so popular.

And to top it all off it's got a great moody fitting soundtrack too. This is just a great work of art, made for nearly everyone to enjoy. What a wonderful surprise. Easily one of my favorites of the year and probably one of my favorite animated movies of the past 10 years.",a5yi33

ebtfvdm,"Fantastic movie. I legit had chills when Spider-Gwen first showed up in-costume. 

I do want to give a hearty fuck you to a couple people in the theater last night. It’s opening night, first showing at a Dolby Cinema. These tickets are $15 and you bring a three year old into a packed theater. She was screaming the whole movie. It was way too loud for her and she was clearly distressed. When you couldn’t calm her down you should’ve left instead of ruining the experience for everyone else. Totally put a damper on the experience. 

Also - don’t fucking text during movies. Especially in a Dolby theater where it’s even darker than normal. 

I miss living near an Alamo Drafthouse. ",a5yi33

ebw6yip,"Just came back from the film and while my expectations were pretty high to begin with due to reviews and word of mouth from some friends, I must say that I was truly blown away by the film.

Without a doubt this was my personal favorite Spider-Man film and I've seen them all except for TASM2. 

The animations/movie design was beautiful and the pacing was great. I loved all of the villains and the fact that they all differentiated from each other with their own individual personalities. My favorite villain was definitely Prowler. I loved the background sounds that were made every time he dashed through chasing after Spiderman. Was definitely teary-eyed when it was revealed that he was MM uncle.

I could go on all night about how amazing this film was but to end this I just wanted to say again that I truly loved this film and is definitely in my top 5 favorite films of 2018

I don't see any other film winning the best animated Oscar. This film just blew through all expectations. It was both hilarious and affecting.",a5yi33
ec4xv2y,It has been a long time since I saw a movie and instantly wanted to go back and watch it again. This movie is amazing! I will probably see it in the theater again and buy it as soon as it comes out! I’m an old-school Spiderman fan and I am surprised that I liked Miles more than Peter Parker in this film. Not to say Peter Parker was bad. He was great. your heart just goes out Miles. Watch this movie. Best Spider-Man movie yet! I hope they make many more!,a5yi33
ec5plas,"Paradigm shift for comic book movies. What this movie did with the medium of animation pushed it beyond anything I've seen before, full stop. What a goddam joy it was to watch too! It was beautiful. Nothing you see is just like, throw-away ""see how cool that looks!"" It pops and bursts to punctuate the narrative, which the movie keeps a focus on from the start to finish. Damn.",a5yi33
ec61a7p,I'd be happy to see another animated superhero movie. The visuals are gorgeous. ,a5yi33
ec9wsd0,"A week later and this movie is still on my mind and the soundtrack is still on my iPhone (now with additional Christmas songs!). I think I'll go see it a third time next week. 

That this is the best superhero movie of the year when that year also included Infinity War, Black Panther, and Incredibles 2 is blowing my mind. It's been a very good year for superhero movies...",a5yi33

ecidf1k,"This movie was basically flawless. Such an amazing Spider-Man movie. I cannot wait to see it again. The only slight knock I had with it personally was some of the animation. The red lines on everything made it feel like I was in a 3D movie and forgot to put the 3D glasses on. During some parts I legitimately thought I bought the wrong ticket or they were playing the wrong version. My eyes do goofy stuff sometimes. Did anyone else have issues with that? Outside of that, it was SO GOOD! ",a5yi33
ecmomkd,"Fantastic movie but there''s one thing that's been bothering me since I got back from the theater, probably because they nailed everything else.

Why is the Mary Jane of Mile's dimension at the gala Kingpin puts on? Maybe she didn't know her Peter was murdered by him but wouldn't she know he's a criminal her husband fought?

Her conversation with alternate dimension Peter is also just played for laughs too, (""lol i just asked for more bread"") which is weird. Hasn't it been a day since her Peter died? And she doesn't feel sad or broken up or suspicious talking to a Spider-Man with Peter's voice?",a5yi33
edbzlh7,"There was one brief scene from the comics I wish they'd adapted: in the comic where Mile's is first introduced, he defeats a villain, but people get upset that he's wearing a Spider-Man costume so soon after Peter's death, and he worries that it's in poor taste. I think it would have been funny if during the final montage there was a clip implying that he wasn't accepted right away, but that Brooklyn warmed up eventually.",a5yi33
eeu2g3u,This shit is lit fam,a5yi33
eg4q13b,"So many amazing scenes but anyone else impressed by dead Spider-Man? When he faces off against Green Goblin how he just stops that spinning collider part with one hand I was like ""holy shit."" Kinda sad he died. I was honestly surprised by it.",a5yi33
ebqqqvx,"Probably my favorite movie of 2018, it felt like it was made for me.  The animation is phenomenal, the music was fantastic, the entire cast killed it, and it kept moving the entire time and never lost its welcome.  I really hope that post credits scene means there is more to come, and I can't wait to see what they do with the rest of the Spidey villains.",a5yi33
ebrx8uw,I honestly think this was a masterpiece. One of my favorite animated films of all time.,a5yi33
ebsxea0,"Excellent film. Perfectly captured who and what Spider-Man is and why the gender or race doesn't matter; he's about doing the right thing, no matter what.

My only gripe; I really wish the original Spidey of Mile's universe got taken out of the picture in some other way like being frazzled off and lost to another dimension instead of Kingpin killing him. Not that the Kingpin is not a formidable enemy, but I just never pictured Spidey going out like that. Plus if he had disappeared into another dimension, they could have had a future film where Miles tries to bring him back.",a5yi33
ebtgba0,I had no idea I wanted Kathryn Hahn as a female Doc Ock. whyboner.jpg,a5yi33

It needs to be nominated for best picture at the Oscars. 

That was incredible, groundbreaking, all of the above. Loved it. ",a5yi33
ebtmp8a,"Wow. Wow wow wow *wow*. I think I loved everything about this film. Not to mention it was surprisingly gutsy with its material for a PG-rated film. On that merit alone it's one of the best movies of the year, one of the greatest animated ones in the last 15 years and my all-around personal favorite superhero movie.

Easiest 10/10 I've given out in a while. Maybe a 11/10 because of my current good mood after seeing that post-credits scene, everyone in the theater completely lost their minds at that point.",a5yi33
ebtu6g9,The only two movies I can think of that embraced the comic book medium fully are this and “Scott Pilgrim vs the World” and I loved both.  ,a5yi33
ebtxd5t,The prowler was sick!,a5yi33
ebuiqen,"Literally everything in this movie is fucking perfect.

I went into this skeptical because I thought that the whole spider-verse thing would take away the focus from Miles. But he was always firmly at the center and he was fucking amazing. He's finally had his defining story and the animation was just ridiculously vivid and lively and beautiful. Fuck i love this movie. 
Best Spiderman movie. 
Best Superhero movie. 
Best Animated movie I've ever seen. 

Watching this again tonight.",a5yi33
ebve0de,"That was legit the best spider-man film adaption period. Animation is definitely the best medium you can tell Spider-man in, it just felt like you in a comic book. I feel like no other spider-man movie after this could capture the energy in this movie, as much as I love the MCU spiderman movies. Every department was just so well done. Animation,Voice casting,sound track,action,writing. The reveal with Uncle Aaron was great too and the relationship between Miles and his Dad was so well-done, you really felt for his dad in that one talk scene.  Honestly can't find any flaws about this movie. 10/10 would already watch again",a5yi33

ebxwnyj,Wow this was way better than I thought it was going to be. I knew it was going to be good based on what everyone was saying but i had no idea it would be so good. Best Spiderman movie ever. Visually it was beautiful. The soundtrack was exhilarating and energetic. The character designs were amazing as was their personalities. My favorite is definitely Spider man noir. His lines were funny and Nic Cage did a great job voicing him. The plot was good and interesting. I'm definitely watching this again. 5/5. This is one of the best movies I've seen this year. ,a5yi33
eby5zcv,How was Nic Cage?,a5yi33
ebyiske,Why doesn't the poll have an 11/10 option?,a5yi33
ebzv8jw,"Just got out, and thought it was absolutely phenomenal. My only real complaint was that we didn't get enough time with each of the Spider-People. Spider-Ham and Spider-Noir were basically just there as comic relief, and I would have liked a little more character development for them. Other than that, I loved every second. ",a5yi33
ec45ybi,"This movie was way better than it had any right to be, but I didn't realize who directed/produced until the end. I also had to wait around through the credits to realize who was Spider-noir, and I gotta say, the realization felt like watching Tropic Thunder the first time. ",a5yi33
ec4nrtp,"Hi, I'd like an animated Fantastic Four movie as good as this please. Amazing movie.",a5yi33
eebd0x2,SUPER LATE to the party but I had to comment how freaking cool this movie's Scorpion was. I know he was barely on screen but everytime he was I was cheering inside. So COOL,a5yi33
eijplgx,"I literally just watched this movie, and I have to say..Hands down the BEST spider man movie! I mean, everything about it was just awesome! And the nods to all the meta was just..too much...Doing introductions over and over...The end credit scene...The scene from the third movie nobody talks about....They hit all the right notes with this, and was easily enjoyable to watch. If you havent seen it yet, get on it! Totally worth a watch!",a5yi33
ebqld5z,"Saw this at an advance screening, so the audience was completely full (they overbook these screenings to make sure of this) and very lively. In some ways that helps the movie experience, and this movie is one where the audience laughing at certain parts and being amazed at certain parts can add to my enjoyment.

The movie itself is gorgeously animated. I know some people are put off by the style of animation, but it rarely dips into the chaos suggested by the trailers and the effect is toned down as compared to the first trailer. I feel no shame by saying that this is my favorite superhero movie of the year, my favorite animated film of the year, and my favorite Spider-Man movie (which is probably the only ""unpopular"" opinion of the three considering the existence of Spider-Man 2, but I didn't say it was the best. Simply my favorite). This movie, in my humble opinion, is superior to Incredibles 2 in an overwhelming number of aspects. To the point of this film almost *lowering* my opinion of Incredibles 2 (a similar situation happened for me when Hereditary came out after A Quiet Place. It's a bad habit, but perspective is everything), which I still of course like but between Spidey and Isle of Dogs, it'll be a true sentiment to the Pixar bias in the Academy if Incredibles 2 earns the Oscar.

The one big complaint I have of Spider-Verse is Kingpin having such a contrived motivation. I'm glad he has defined motivations at all, but for some reason it just felt a bit lazy to me. I do have to let this slide a little due to the movie having so many great characters, and the strong focus on Miles makes this less noticeable. Because Kingpin's plan and motivations are ultimately not that important to the movie.

The other Spider-Men are all so great. Noir is hilarious, and I would love a spin-off of him just beating up Nazis. There are definitely levels of focus that the movie offers each spider-person. Miles obviously is at the forefront, with Gwen and Peter Parker right behind him, and then the other three given notably less to do. But honestly this isn't such a huge fault, you can't expect every character to have as much dimension as the last.

The scene when Miles first truly becomes Spider-Man (really the sequence beginning with him in his dorm room when his dad comes by) is one of the best scenes of the year imo. The whole ""you can wear the mask"" thing that comes into play at the end of the movie is a little cheesy but it's presented so effectively that it's hard to be mad.

Great Stan Lee cameo, and great after-credits scene as well.

Right now this movie makes the top 5 of the year for me. I'm simply astonished, and my expectations were already really high, tracing back to the first teaser trailer released a *year* ago. I'm so glad it didn't let me down.",a5yi33
ehfflyu,"Haven't seen it said yet here, but Daniel Pemberton's score was fantastic. Between this and his score on Legend of the Sword he has been killing it lately.",a5yi33
em9jv56,"I  rewatched tonight  Spiderman into the spiderverse after watching it about a month ago with friends, unfortunately there were some technical problems last time which Made it a bit blurry but my God I had no idea what I missed out on in matter of visual euphoria. The movie is just so creative and blissful in its flawless execution of every move even the backgrounds, some moments even have super quirky moments like when miles was tapping his throat with the highlighter and some wiggly lines came out. The first time I watched it I felt like the pacing is horrible but now that I rewatched it I think it was just my feelings that day, it didn't pull punches in the emotional spectrum and it only made me wish that I could have such moments in my real life, perhaps there are and I'm just not truly partaking them, I'll have to find out for my self, but one thing for sure this movie has taught is that even if you feel like everything is against you, you still have to give it your all, take for example today as a matter of fact, I went to play some basketball in the court with some acquaintances I spotted, now I'm still a beginner and wasn't all that great, but my attitude towards it was terrible, I would always mention how I'm so embarrassed 
and what not when I could've instead made the best of it and try to make it a joke and ask for consultation from others, point is I didn't truly give it my all. All I ended up doing was making them feel uncomfortable and myself feeling inadequate and unconfident. Next time I won't try to think so hard and just go with the flow and try to make it as best as possible :) sorry for the personal rant there but it truly made a connection with me on such a momentous day, I write this the day before my graduation day and I think I will be listening to this movies soundtrack like I always was (before even watching it) (looking at you sunflower) when I head into the ceremony. 
If you read this until the end I really want to personally thank you for taking your time to read my experience, this was actually a very nice method of venting out as I feel that not many  listen to me despite me always listening when they feel down. This is definetly one of my favorite movies and the connection I have made with it will be unforgettable. I wish you all the best.",a5yi33
emvq8v9,"I liked this Doc Ock version a lot. This professor looked brilliant, charismatic and scary.",a5yi33
ebr1x6c,"As a movie, I felt like this movie has perfectly encapsulated the 2010s. Weird, ambitious, self-referential, silly, complex, diverse, and turning everything up to 11. Its revolutionary and feels like a modern classic!",a5yi33
ebr3w1n,"I thought it was absolutely brilliant. 

To get the most obvious thing out of the way first, I'll mention the visuals. I'm not really a huge fan of the (for the lack of a better word) ""traditional"" CG style found in the works of Pixar etc. There's nothing *wrong* with the look per se, but for me it's so prevalent that it's long lost the wonder I felt when watching Toy Story for the first time. Sure, today's CG animated films look massively better on a technological level, but the overall visual style is still the same as it was all those years ago.

So with that in mind I thought the visuals for 'Into the Spider-Verse' were *stunning.* I realise the look won't suit everyone, but I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. The mix of animation styles and vivid colours work so, so well. It's genuinely one of the best looking films I've ever seen, animated or otherwise.

Visuals aside, it's still an incredibly strong film with a great script and very strong direction. The characters are all wonderful and it does a great job of balancing humour with the more serious scenes. 

I was also pleasantly surprised by the villains. I'd heard from a few people that they felt Kingpin was underdeveloped, and while I would have appreciated a few more scenes with him I still think the film did a great job with his portrayal. His backstory is absolutely tragic, and despite the low age rating this film did not hold back on Kingpin being, er, Kingpin. Of course it's a world away from the in your face violence of Daredevil's Kingpin, but this incarnation quite literally doesn't pull any punches. It gives me hope that the character could still work within the more family-friendly confines of the MCU films should it ever happen. The other villains are also great, with the Doc Ock reveal being particularly good.

So yes, Into the Spider-Verse is a fantastic film and easily one of my favourites of the year.",a5yi33

ebtqymj,"Nailed the soundtrack, every song was perfectly fitting for the scene.

Artistic style was gushing with detail and originality.  You need to watch it twice to see things you missed.  The only downfall was the 3d red/blue art effect could sometimes throw my focus off.

Characters were fleshed out enough to keep the focus on Miles and Peter, but I was left wanting more of Spider Noir and Spider Gwen.  Also, Uncle Aaron’s motives were never elaborated upon.

Some real tear jerk moments too.  That bit with Stan Lee was one of the more heartfelt cameos and it hit harder since this is the first marvel universe movie we’ve had since his death.

I’m definitely buying this one to watch again and can’t wait for a sequel with more Spider Gwen.

The after credit scene was funny and confusing.

**A**",a5yi33

They really used all the tools of animation at their disposal ",a5yi33

The animation! The writing! The emotion! The humor! It's all here!! This came out of nowhere and is now maybe my favorite movie of the year.",a5yi33
ebtwiv2,"Wow,  what a ride!  I loved how hilarious the screenplay was for this film,  there were so many pop culture quips that I almost want to go back and  watch it again before I forget them!

Everyone  has said it here already, but God was this film gorgeous; this  animation style really fit the tone of the film and catered to its  audience that was definitely going to be a mix of adults and children,  and the script managed to cater to both audiences as well.

The  thing I loved most about this film was how it was a proper Miles  Morales story brought to life on the big screen.  I loved how, despite  the stakes of the dimensional plot and the individual stories of the  Spider-People, everything still felt contained enough to focus on Miles'  growth into becoming Spider-Man and not get carried away with Kingpin's  story, or the villains, or the other heroes, etc.

I  enjoyed every second of this, and loved how this film took its audience  seriously and delivered a funny, heartfelt story of heroism and  recovery.

Also, that had to be the best post credits scene I've ever seen in my life.  Spider-Man 2099 and memes?  Count me in.",a5yi33

And you know what? The movie shattered all me expectations. I'd heard good things about it so I was expecting a solid 8/10. Fuck that, what I got was a 12/10.

I thought the robot was just a machine controlled by her spider, and the rapport was built upon her friendship with the spider.

It has a straightforward and predictable plot but really nailed the emotional moments. It's a simple concept well executed. I was also very invested in the characters in spite of their limited screentime each. Excellent visuals, directing, casting and acting overall. This is one of very few movies worth shelling a few more bucks to view in 3D.",a5yi33
ebx0yip,"
It's a really incredible movie. I've been a huge Spider-Man since I first discovered the character, as I always loved how he was basically a regular guy who got thrown in to the world of superheroes. He starts off as a kid who just wants to be liked, and then deals with guilt, bad luck, overwhelming responsibility and a ton of other issues that pretty much anyone can relate to. And this movie remains faithful to the character to an amazing degree. No matter who it is under the mask, they all had to learn to deal with tragedy and improving themselves, and we get to see Miles go through doubt and uncertainty to finally take ""a leap of faith"". The quote at the end by Stan Lee really brings it together, in that a superhero isn't defined by his or her powers, but by whether or not he chooses to do the right thing, not for a reward, but just because it's the right thing to do. The soundtrack really brings the movie together too, and the animation is absolutely spectacular. From Spider-Ham's cartoony style to Penni's full on anime flair, each Spider-Man has a really unique aesthetic and personality and the movie just oozes a ton of charm. Miles was a great Spider-Man, and I loved getting to see the Peter Parker I grew up with become a mentor, albeit reluctantly at first. Everything was a ton of fun, and I can't wait to see what comes next.
I actually stopped reading comics after Brand  New Day, but loved the Spectacular Spiderman cartoon and liked Homecoming. I didn't know much about Miles, but he really grew on me and
 I loved getting to see a new generation take on the Spiderman mantle, while still seeing Peter Parker as an experienced hero who manages to bounce back thanks to seeing the hope and courage within Miles.",a5yi33

One of my only issues is that aside from Miles, old Peter and arguably Gwen we didn't really get any time to get to know the Spiders, although what time we did get was glorious. I demand a Spider-Ham animated series, Sony/Marvel!

ecfgqhi,"Just left the theater. I am *riding the high* of this movie. I was on the edge of my seat. At one point in the theater at a very poignant, suspenseful moment, a little kid quietly whispered in the silence, ""*Don't do it.*"" -- And instead of ruining the moment, it made it even better for me. 

This was such a VISUALLY unique film. Like, JUST talking visuals -- it was amazing. I was so worried about having a seizure or migraine, and at times it really pushed it, but it was just. so. damn. beautiful overall. I've really never seen a movie embody the spirit of comics and bring them alive, and yet still be its own animated, moving thing before. All the scenes at night, especially that BEAUTIFUL montage of Miles really owning himself, god. It took my breath away. All those funny little details -- from sound effects being visually represented, to genre-specific quirks like the comic sans typing...I can't get over how much this movie spoke to me. 

Story-wise. Fuck. When it was funny, it was funny. When it was heartwarming, my heart felt ready to burst. The script was so TIGHT. Fast-paced, but always purposeful; it felt like everything mattered and flowed really well. It was like, what, two hours run time? And I wanted *more* by the end. Even Miles' Peter Parker had me wanting so. much. more. even in that bit of screen time. That instant connection those two characters had -- it established so much in so little time: Miles' values, character, motivation. You could believe how charismatic, affable, and genuinely *good* Miles' Peter Parker was.  Miles is 13 and witnesses so much in the film, and holds everything on the basis of a promise...Another movie might have had a weaker script that would have had an audience member going, ""Would this character really do all of this JUST because he promised someone?"" But you could believe it here, you could really believe that this mattered *a lot* to Miles and would be a driving force for him. The writing was so phenomenal. It really felt like it did this character to justice -- really brought him to life in a way that is going to speak and awaken a love for comic books in an entire generation of kids. The major characters (Peter Porker, Penni, and Noir aside) had their own facets, quirks, motivation. I loved that Miles' family had their own moments of connection and interaction that made them matter as characters beyond just their purpose-in-relation-to-Miles (Jefferson and Aaron). And fuck, older Peter Parker. I won't even go there because it'd take another six paragraphs and I want to eat this burrito I just bought. 

I felt like the audience and Miles had to earn his suit -- and when it came, it felt worth it. It felt amazing. It felt like it really belonged to him. God. I just. I cannot get over how amazing this film was. ""Give me thirty minutes,"" I told my friend, walking out of the theater, ""Give me thirty minutes to pee, catch my breath, and I could watch this movie again, easy."" 

I've been teaching Miles Morales in my high school class for a while now. I've been using clips from the movie since before the full trailer was even released. This movie was everything I wanted and more, and I can't wait for it to come out to own so I can watch it over, and over again. I can't wait for people, especially kids, to love five hundred things and more in this movie. 

edit: Like, Infinity War had all levels of disappointment for me. This movie? People should NOT sleep on this movie -- whether because they think it's pandering, too alienating because of its animated, whatever. Don't sleep on this banger. The soundtrack was also great. My heart was racing; I felt real suspense. I love it so much I want to eat this movie. ",a5yi33

ebw8v9s,"I just got back from the theaters and all I can say is wow...(well a little more than that)

The Animation was amazing.  It was chaotic in a perfectly controlled sort of way.  The characters and scenery looked amazing and the animated medium allowed for things that wouldn't be possible in live-action.

All the Spider-people had something unique to bring to the Miles' story, even the ones who got less screen time.  

Kingpin was a great villain.  Imposing, yet sympathetic.  

Prowler was a great secondary villain.  He started off just a menacing masked henchman.  Who's identity became especially poignant when revealed later in the film.  

Doc Ock, made a great henchman in the traditional sense, and the twist on the usual role that Ock takes was a surprise to me.

Other characters like Aunt May and Jefferson Davis were great as well.

The sound design was on point with the great sense of epicness that I expect from Spider-Man.  The music and soundtrack fit each character and situation where it was used and got me into the scene

But Spiderverse now wins that title, even though the character interactions were a little rough around the edges, IMO. The overall story wasn't as strong as Incredibles, but... 

I just absolutely adored the way the movie *felt* like watching a sort of ""living comic book"". That framing is what sold the movie to me over any other. I would rather watch *any* superhero movie with that conceptual approach than a live action version. 

I confess, I was not as enthused to see the movie as I might normally be because the trailer's animation style put me off. It was a little too jittery and not smooth in the way I prefer.

The animation style, and tbh at first when I saw the first teaser the fps really bothered me but I think they sped it up slighlty where its not quite 24 but not 12? or maybe I just got used to it. The story was great too, opened a lot of comic-stories that I wasnt exposed to prior. Like I pretty much only knew movie spiderman and occasionally would read a little comics and watch the cartoons here and there but nothing that would make an impact. really cool to see the different spiders and what their stories were. also killer soundtrack. i have the album on repeat.

eh4qc1q,"I can't believe how much I enjoyed this film. The first thing I love is the editing. On point and well paced. There can be so many things happening at once on and off screen but the cuts were just fast enough to capture it all and allow me to fully understand the events that are transpiring. The fighting sequence in Aunt May's house is a good example where there are 5 fights happening simultaneously.

The graphics were superb. I loved the spaced dot effects like you see in real comic books. Out of focus objects have a uniquely colored edge. And the way the characters move is slick and efficient. There are a lot of details that give the characters realism like at the beginning when Miles was getting out of the cop car he closed the door with his foot like he'd done it a thousand times before. Also, I loved the spidey-sense graphic. The huge 'look out' text filling the window before a villain comes through was fantastic.

Musical soundtrack was excellent. I guess the Sony music license helps a lot.

One of the movie's strongest points was its writing. The characters have strong integrity; acting well in line with their established stories. The dialogue is excellent. The uncle's last dying words could've been filled with cliches but it wasn't. The father's concern for his son was very believable. Both the good guys and the bad guys were interesting. Good jokes throughout the film too.

Overall, several times throughout this film I felt like this is a much higher quality movie than some of the recent Marvel releases. I still find the train scene to be a poor introduction to the movie but I'm very glad I watched it. Everyone involved in this film deserves a pat on the back.",a5yi33
ebqzpj7,"I've seen this movie twice now and I'm in love with everything it is and everything it does.

The short version:
	• Refreshingly modern and stylish
	• Every aspect is executed so well (writing, art-style, framing/""camera""-work, editing, music, voice acting) that it makes the final product so much more than the sum of its parts
	• Acknowledges previous Spider-Man media - it's self-aware, but not self-indulgent
	• They did a fantastic job balancing the characters - some might not have gotten much screen time, but I feel they all had a chance to show their individual personalities
	• There were some really strong emotional beats in this movie: Miles wanting to help Peter B. in the vent; Miles giving up; Uncle Aaron's death; Miles finding himself

Here's the long version - it includes a bunch of rambly observations and things I liked from the two times I've watched this lovely movie.

_______

So just some background - this movie wasn't even on my radar whatsoever. I think I found out about it from a YouTube ad. And when it came on, I didn't skip it because of how insanely good the art style looked. It had its own unique style, and looked ridiculously high quality. I've been following it since, and was lucky enough to see it today at an advanced screening. I'm also not a comic-book fan, and the extent of my knowledge of Spider-Man is just from the movies (and I don't even remember what happens in the original Spider-Man trilogy, really).

I honestly, genuinely believe that this is one of the best superhero... media of the last few years. And I [gushed about Infinity War](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/8eocd2/the_official_infinity_war_international_release/dxxmz8h/) too when that came out. To me, it's the culmination of so much of the superhero movies/tv shows/animated movies that we've seen. It looks at the idea of ""superhero fatigue"" and gives it a resounding ""no"".

**Refreshingly Stylish**

The easiest way I can put it is that **this movie works**. It's so incredibly well-executed - it's difficult to point to the one thing that makes it good, because there isn't just one thing. It's so many wonderful parts that, when put together, are so much greater than any one particular part (much like the Avengers!). But I'll do my best to try to put into words what I loved about each part.

The **art direction** just blew me away. It leans into the comic-bookeyness, and leans in *hard*. You see hints of it in the trailer - overlaid text, accentuated linework, those printing dot things that I don't know the name of. But because it's animated, they put so much care into the lighting that it brings it to an entirely other level. You get these gorgeous, picturesque shots all over the movie that they don't even hover too long on. The colour palettes are beautiful, and the movie doesn't hesitate to switch it up depending on what's going on on the screen. The effects in certain scenes are hyper-stylised, giving this kind of grand feel that doesn't just rely on explosions everywhere.

The **editing** makes the movie and world feel so dynamic - something that you want in a Spider-Man movie. It's fast, quick, modern, stylish. It reminds me a little bit of what Edgar Wright does with his kinetic energetic style. But it doesn't feel like it's copying it, because it, once again, leans into the comic-bookeyness in its edits. There are panels and frames everywhere littered throughout the movie, making every single cut dynamic and interesting.

The framing (composition?) and camerawork is so freaking good. There are just so many stand-out little scenes that could pretty much be standalone pieces. But it's not all static, either - there's so much crazy panning and tracking that makes it exhilarating to watch during combat & swinging. And it blends perfectly with the art style and editing. Each one of these parts adds a whole other layer of depth to each other part.

The **music** - both the soundtrack and OST - fits so perfectly with the art style. It adds to how dynamic the environment/action/movement is, and how modern and lively this world feels. I'd describe the OST as ""cartoony"", but in the best sense of the word. It's not generically grand, like the Marvel movies can be, and it's not campy, it's just energetic as hell.
_____

**Characters and Story**

With all the aesthetic style out of the way, we get to the writing! And boy, what good writing this is. While Deadpool is gratuitously referential with constant wall-breaking, this movie is confidently self-aware but earnest. The jokes aren't just quips thrown in - they happen naturally, in-world, and actually have a purpose too!

The emotional beats also feel modern - well-executing some cliches, side-stepping others... Your heart-strings aren't being manipulated - the movie earns all of it. The writing's kept so tight, keeping the momentum pushing forward throughout the movie. It's smart and self-aware.

Each character's given so much personality in just a few short lines & on-screen actions. That includes the side-characters. The spiders-men (and -women) are given room to shine, multiple times.

**Character's Perspective & Camerawork**

I loved how well they used the camera to frame Miles' perspective. At the start of the movie, you're seeing Spider-Man through Miles' eyes. He's unnaturally fast, a tiny speck in the distance zipping all over the place. We follow Miles' journey as he goes from being the observer, to being dragged along by a web, to being completely disoriented as he swings through the air, to finally being in full control of his motion in the air at the end. The camera goes from being completely disorienting to capturing the controlled speed of Miles.

This is one of those movies that make me so happy to be alive. It's this beautiful collaboration of so many creatives, pouring in so much effort to give it this much polish and quality.

It knows what it is, it knows its medium, and plays to its strengths. It's dynamic, modern, stylish as hell. It knows its place in pop-culture (and all the baggage that being a Spider-Man movie brings).

One of the best movies of the year period. Style for days with awesome animation and a banger of a soundtrack.

One thing that they absolutely NAILED was the amount of humor. The movie has some great jokes, but the amount of comedic moments felt perfect. It didn't feel like humor was being crammed into the movie ala deadpool 2 and Gaurdians 2 where it's just joke after joke after joke and only like half of them are landing. They took their shots and the jokes landed, but they also kept it grounded in Miles story.

 - Has Peter ever been blonde in the comics? It kind of took me out of it.

 - It's cool that Spider-Man gets snapped earlier this year and that happens in this movie, it's cool and meta (kind of) and I liked it.

 - It was sad when he died because Chris Pine as an older Peter Parker is kind of perfect casting.

 - I almost cried and I especially almost cried when they perfectly animated Stan into the same fucking scene lol.",a5yi33

I loved it! The screenwriting was fantastic and the animation was next level! I found myself like every new scene more than the last.

Don’t waste your time on entire movies about villains that revolve around Spider-Man who can’t make an appearance. ",a5yi33
ebtqaid,"I just came back from the movie theater and I can't stop thinking about the movie. I have so much to say about it. I knew it was gonna be good, but I didn't realize it would leave me in complete awe. It just might be the best Spider-Man movie ever. It just might top Spider-Man 2, which is also my favorite movie ever. It was incredible. This movie had **every damn thing**. The story, the animation, the fan service, the message! It was a perfect film. This movie had my attention the entire time, there were moments that left my mouth open, I swear I barely blank, it was complete eye candy. 

The entire **story**, you just want Miles to be the Spider-Man he's destined to be. Its a well paced journey, and its just amazing throughout. Its such a triumphant moment when he finally makes it. The characters are so damn good. I found myself rooting for broke down Peter. You wanted him to get better too! I'm super glad he didn't turn out to be an asshole, but they made him a lil jerky with the same values he should and would have. Gwen was really cool, and I kinda wish we got more from Peni, Noir, and Peter Porker. Also, Kingpin did his damn thing. Seeing him use Spidey's death for his own game is so him. Also, Peter's death scene hit hard, and I expected it to happen. It felt like Infinity War all over again! Seriously, that was brutal. (Sidenote: this universe's Peter was blonde! That was the most surprising thing in the movie!) Oh and I find it hilarious how there were 2 big Doc Ock reveals in Spider-Man media this year! 

The **message** in this movie was amazing. Spider-Man is known for being one of us, who's just trying to do good, and the message that anyone can be that person was so damn good.  One thing I loved about the movie is that Spider-Man no matter what, will **always** get back up cause that's who he is. 

Alright one last thing I wanna touch on is the **fan service**. Holy shit theres a lot of it from beginning to end. Hell, the intro even showed all of Columbia Pictures' past logos. It started with the **freaking** Comics Code Authority! Of course, there was the Spidey backstory montages and one of my favorite moments was they used the audio from Spider-Man 1 for the ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" line. Another thing, lots of 1967 references, which I loved. The iconic song, the memes during and after the credits! That was awesome. I also noticed when Kingpin is using the multi dimension thing Earth 616 is shown on the ""map"" thingy. Thats Spider-Man's Prime universe, the comics one! Doc Ock saying ""do you know what it feels like to disintegrate"" made me and my lil bro laugh considering his dusting. Also, the moves Spider-Man did were sometimes direct copies from the movie! The final swing between the legs move Miles does is directly from the 2002 movie's final swing! My favorite callback tho was Miles saved Gwen **exactly** how Peter saved Gwen in Spider-Man 3. **Best reference in the film.** The Stan Lee love was also greatly appreciated, I'm glad the Man was given that respect, the whole movie is a damn love letter to his creation. Spider-Man 2099 I kinda spoiled myself with, but damn did it still hype me up seeing him on screen. Also multi dimensional tool (cool!) and the 1967 was the cherry on top of the movie. Oh and the Christmas song was freaking great! 

Spider-Man is a character that means a lot to me, ever since I was a kid. As a diehard fan, this movie gave me what I wanted and more. I felt the love everyone put into this, from the actors, to the directors, to the animators. It was simply phenomenal.",a5yi33
ebv5626,"What a movie. I went into this not very hyped and it ended up being one of my favorite movies of the year.

\-I absolutely LOVED the fact that Peter Parker in this was the Tobey Maguire version. I mean, he's of course not *exactly* the Tobey Maguire version but it was a super heavy influence and as someone who grew up on those films it was a delight to watch. Even Aunt May's house/backyard copied the set almost exactly!

\-Miles Morales had a tremendous arc. I knew nothing about him going in but I came out thinking he was a really worthy Spider-Man, not the same as Peter Parker but with the same spirit.

\-The visual style of this movie was simply astounding. It felt like I was watching a comic book come to life. Super super unique.

\-I loved that it wasn't a kids movie. Obviously it was still family friendly but overall it really wasn't that different, tonally, than the average MCU movie.

\-It's crazy that Sony went from making the disastrous Venom to making this. I hope they figure out why this worked and Venom didn't.",a5yi33

ebysew9,"I really liked it a lot, and there’s not much I can say there that hasn’t already been said in this thread. That said, I do have one criticism to bring up:

Why doesn’t the movie really acknowledge Gwen and Peter’s relationship? Yes, we see Gwenverse Peter being killed off in Gwen’s flashback, and overcoming his death is most of Gwen’s arc. But if it’s such a big deal to her, why does meeting a living (albeit much older and crustier) Peter seem to have no impact on her? She doesn’t even acknowledge that he’s the alternate of the best friend she’s been grieving.

Similarly, Peter doesn’t seem to care much about Gwen. Presuming this Peter has largely the same backstory as comics Peter (which seems to be the case), Gwen’s death would have been a huge moment for him. As such he should be at least a little flustered to see her alive, even after all these years. Obviously he wouldn’t be romantically interested in this Gwen (given the age gap and all), but meeting her should have an emotional punch to it.

It’s not really a huge deal, but it just seems like a missed opportunity to me. Maybe they were worried about distracting the audience from the central conflict. I think it would have added a bit more depth to the team’s relationships, which are otherwise very Miles-centric.",a5yi33

This was a visual spectacle and had certain themes and maturity that made me appreciate the movie on a higher level. It was brave to do certain things they did, but it was also pretty damn real. I was able to relate a lot to Miles, being someone that draws/does creative things as well. I can't wait to see more chemistry between Miles and Gwen - they got something going there. Old Peter Parker killed it every moment and Noir had some of the best lines in the movie. Speaking of which, a full spinoff with Noir and that 30's setting would be so cool to see on the big screen. 

Alright, sorry everyone, but it's time for my inner weeb to come out. Peni Parker is absolutely adorable; the animation sequences were so stylized in her shots, I thought it was hilarious that she was fixing the goober to some hard rap, was always munching on some snacks, AND OH MY GOD SHE ALSO WORE HEELYS. Now obviously she isn't the star of the movie but I feel like a few extra lines talking about her connection with SP//DR would've strengthened the emotions and her characterization when the robot got destroyed. I can see a standalone movie about her tug at some serious heartstrings. Also Spider Noir was a total bro for giving that little support and piggyback ride.

ed7c6g7,"I’m aware that the movie was released nearly a month ago, but I just saw it and it was truly phenomenal. My initial impression of the movie, from the trailers, was one of skepticism and even disgust, as I had thought that it was a movie which would pander to a very young audience, and act as a disservice to the original Spider-Man franchise. Fortunately, I was completely wrong, and my expectations were thoroughly subverted. I was prompted to watch the movie because a lot of friends had recommended it to me, in addition to my reading of an immensity of positive reviews online. While watching the movie, the animation was unprecedentedly immersive and surreal, to the extent that it almost felt like watching a live action movie. Moreover, the characters had a profound sense of depth and were pretty endearing, from Miles Morales—the protagonist—himself to the comical Spider-Ham. Most prominently, the story itself was really gratifying and also lugubrious at times. It details the life of the protagonist as he is coerced into attending an “elitist” school, in which he is unwittingly humiliated a multitude of times. This embarrassment, coupled with a feeling of isolation due to being misunderstood by his peers, and even most of his family members—with the exception of his uncle—leads him to feel insecure and despondent about his capabilities, which he learns to overcome through harnessing his powers. He eventually conquers his insecurities and self-consciousness, takes a “leap of faith,” and realizes his true capabilities after his friends’ dire situation acts as an exigency for overcoming his fears. This heroic feat leads to a cathartic ending, which also includes an unexpected meme during the scene following the credits. Though this is probably an unpopular opinion, Spider-Man: into the Spider-Verse is undoubtedly one of the greatest Marvel movies I have ever seen, and it is my favorite Spider-Man movie too, even though I loved the original trilogy in which Tobey Maguire acted as Spider-Man.

Other than that, it's real good. It's fun and sappy. Aunt May's an ass-kicker, lmao.",a5yi33

ebqzm0m,"Every time I start getting superhero fatigue something great comes out, this time though it’s one of the best super hero films ever. Definitely the best spider man movie and one of the best animated features I’ve ever seen. (And I’m a nerd when it comes to animation) 

The script was really tight, the action scenes while being plentiful never dragged on for too long which made for really good pacing. The character development was great with Mile’s arc being the quintessential super hero arc done sooooo well. Constant good humor makes sure the film never gets to emotionally heavy, while never getting in the way of the strong emotional moments. The cast was perfect.
The animation was incredible, from the colors to the mixing of styles, to the purposely low frame count movements it all worked. The great script meant the style never outweighed the substance.
The sound design, mix, and music fit perfectly.

Seriously a exceptional feat of animation while also just being a damn great film.

ebr0q9h,"I've seen a lot of great movies this year, shout out to moviepass, before it evolves again in to a shell of itself, but this one of the best for sure.  Its in my top five films of the year, and its probably at #2 or #3.  

The animation is incredible, its like watching comics to life.  The word boxes, the unique style, the fluid animation, the kind of 2D/3D hybrid, just a wonderful watch.  As I am sitting there, in the few lulls in the movie, im thinking I can't watch to watch this at home with HDR on my OLED.  

One of the best animated films and superhero films ever.  I've never been a huge Miles fan in the comics, but Sony won me over here.

I enjoyed all the characters, even though I didn't know all of them.  The Animation style was off the charts for me.  I hope they make 100 more of these.

I also should have seen but didn't see what was coming for his uncle.  I mean, Spidey's uncle always get the shaft.  Really good twist.

ec2dmp7,"That. Was. Awesome.  The art style was every bit as good as the trailers let on, and they absolutely took advantage of the animated medium to make a movie that just couldn't be done as a live-action movie.  The inclusion of comic book thought bubbles and other little visual effects was a really neat touch I wasn't expecting.  The jokes landed, the voice acting was top notch, the story dragged in a couple of places but overall kept me totally engaged the entire time, and music was on point. If you're considering seeing this movie at all, even just a little curious, do yourself a favor and see it. It was one of the best theater-going experiences I've had all year.",a5yi33

ec6wrpc,Really unique movie. Didn't know what to expect and generally I'm indifferent to superhero movies but that was a really great use of the comic book and super hero aesthetic. In a period where we are getting inundated with the Marvel/Star Wars/Disney treatment this was a huge breath of fresh air.,a5yi33
ec7icje,"I remember after The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and nobody liked it, there were rumors that Sony was going to try to reboot the series again. I was thinking that I'd have no interest in watching another reboot of the same character's story again.

In the past 17 months, we've had two Spider-Man films released (three, if you count movies in which he's not the main character), one of which features eight versions of the character and everything about it has been pretty amazing. I really don't have a single complaint about this movie. It was pure fun, start to finish.",a5yi33
ec8apg2,"Watched it yesterday, my god this film is a gorgeous love letter to comic and animation art. This movie is spot-on brilliant. I managed to find a goof-up, though.

In the scene where Miles runs away from the Prowler, the latter tells Kingpin that he has the ""security clips"" from the tunnel. Knowing that Prowler turns out to be his Uncle Aaron, and ""security clips"" hopefully refers to CCTV footage, wouldn't he have seen and recognised Miles as Spidey earlier even before he took off Miles' mask later on? 

I think that was quite a flaw but nothing that took away from the movie's flow that much.

ednazij,"Man, I had a blast with this movie.

One thing that's kind of been bugging me though, that I would appreciate an explanation for... how did they handle the different Spideys' web-slinging tech?

I thought while watching that perfect blond Spider-Man had organic web-slinging as part of his biology (which makes sense if this is essentially Raimi/Tobey's Spider-Man), and that he tells Miles' to swing after they meet, which would only be possible if Miles also had the biological ability.

We later see Peter B. Parker with the more traditional mechanical Web-Shooters. And it seems like Miles has them as well? Where did they come from?

Also, later Miles tells Gwen that he made some tech himself. How? That wasn't exactly established as part of his character.

What am I missing?",a5yi33

One question though...

When Peter B and Gwen first saw one another outside Alchemax, they didn’t react - despite (in their own universes) Gwen being his first love and dying and Peter being her best friend and dying. Granted they’re not the SAME Peter or Gwen but still, I thought they’d embrace or something.

Despite pulling references from a hundred different places, it still managed to be its own thing.

The after credits scene was hilarious too.",a5yi33
ebs1tij,"I guess I'll post here because I watched last night and I can't stop thinking about this film.

This movie was phenomenal. I sat through so much of the film with such a stupid giddy grin on my face, it was like a dream come true. The animation, the quips, the world building, everything was so on point I forgot that Spider-Man: Homecoming even existed (Previously my second favorite Spider-Man). The world felt so FULL and lived in, and in a much different way than the live-action MCU.

I'm internally debating if this dethrones Spider-Man 2 for me as they are so DIFFERENT, but it's obviously without a doubt the best animated adaptation we've seen yet (and it makes me miss The Spectacular Spider-Man TV show even more).

The comic book stylized animation was absolutely beautiful, and I found myself realizing several times throughout the movie that animation was THE BEST way to adapt a Spider-Man / Superhero comic. I'd love to see more high quality Marvel superhero animated films (an area where DC pretty much exclusively dominates).

But Sony pls give us a spin off Nick Cage spider-noir film also heh",a5yi33
ebsu4po,stan lee's cameo made me really emotional. what a great movie.,a5yi33
ebz96a4,"Loved this movie. First of all I have to mention the distinctive art style - it's unlike your cookie cutter Dreamworks, Imagination, and Disney/Pixar art style. The characters look more realistic than them, but still have a larger-than-life look to them with a splash of comic book influence. The whole movie also has such stylish directing and transitions, there's definitely an influence from Lord and Miller even if they're not directing. It makes me wish for more animated movie in the future to find their own unique art style. 

But more importantly, the story here is great. There's excellent characterization and development for Miles and Peter B. Parker. You feel invested in their journeys and struggles especially with Miles who has it rough because he's outclassed by the other Spider-Mans so there's more pressure on him to live up to his powers. Meanwhile, Kingpin has proper motivation for his evil plan with wanting his family back. The movie never forgets to be fun though, there's so many little callbacks to previous Spider-Man films and the comics for the fans. 

Also unexpected was how emotional this movie was. It really did a good job cementing Miles's relationship with is Dad and Uncle Aaron despite the limited screentime they have. I should mention that the pacing of this movie is magnificent. 

I don't have many issues with the movie because it's done so well, but I do feel like the ""glitch"" is very randomized and an easy to introduce tension whenever the writers feels like it. Then again I suppose it's no different than webshooters running out web fluid in the comics. ",a5yi33
ebzatq6,Why the fuck wasn;t there more Peni Parker,a5yi33

ec4v0np,"I saw it yesterday. It's perfect. I've never seen a perfect movie until this. Jesus Christ, I'm trying really hard to think of something I didn't *love* in this movie. Nada.

11 out of 10. My favourite movie ever.",a5yi33
ecfg3ya,"I've waited 4 years to love Spider-Man this much. From comics to movies to video games, the last Spider-Man related story that I truly loved was the divisive Marc Webb movie, The Amazing Spider-Man 2. However, 2018 has really turned things around for my favorite Marvel superhero; from his groundbreaking video game for the PS4 to the brilliant Nick Spencer taking the reigns from the incompetent Dan Slott in the comics. Hell, even the MCU's depiction of Spider-Man (Which I despised in both Civil War and Homecoming) was surprisingly enjoyable in Infinity War, despite my thoughts on the rest of the film. The resurgence in quality Spider-Man stories continues with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse; perhaps the best superhero film since 2004's Spider-Man 2.

The voice cast couldn't have been better. I've been saying how Shameik Moore would make a perfect Miles Morales ever since I saw him in Dope and he doesn't disappoint here. Much like Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn or J.K Simmons J.J Jameson, Shameik Moore IS Miles Morales as far as I'm concerned. He nails Morales ambition, his selflessness, his emotional vulnerability and his overall shyness in one of my favorite comic book movie performances ever. You could not have picked a better actor for this role.

Jake Johnson as an older, more broken (But still witty) Spider-Man who's lost his way was unexpected, but really interesting. Johnson is funny and charismatic, but has a real emotional pathos to him that takes his performance to the next level. He may actually be my favorite cinematic acting performance for Peter Parker He's a surprisingly complex character for a more family-targeted Spider-Man film and Johnson handles Parker's ascent from washed up has-been to the Spidey we all know and love wonderfully.

Nicolas Cage as Spider-Man Noir is a joy to listen to whenever he's on screen. His deliciously hammy New York accent firing off witty 1930s one liners is something never knew I needed so badly. I found myself smiling pretty much every time he spoke. It's a smaller role, but by God, Cage absolutely does his thing and it benefits this wacky, incredibly imaginative movie wonderfully.

All of the characters here feel so real and human. Miles' strong sense of honor and commitment to the ideals of his role models make him such a likable and easy-to-root for lead. Long before Miles dons his iconic red & black hoodie costume from the comics, he fully embodies the selflessness, compassion and empathy that make Spider-Man such an inspirational and iconic character. I can totally understand why his kindness and capacity for good inspire Jake Johnson's Spider-Man to return to his heroic and altruistic ways he had long since abandoned. The film really does an excellent job of testing Miles' will power, the sincerity of his innate goodness, putting him through the ringer emotionally as he suffers insurmountable, but staggeringly human, losses. This is the kind of Spider-Man that I wanted to be when I grew up. The character journey that Peter Parker goes through here is easily the most nuanced and layered he's experienced in a movie. From the deadbeat loser we see in the first act, to the hopeless martyr of the second to our Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man we witness in the third, the sheer depth (And natural pace) of Spider-Man's development here is something I honestly never thought the screenwriting duo of Lord & Rothman were capable of. Even with villains and minor characters like Kingpin, Uncle Aaron and Miles' father Officer Davis are all characters whose hopes, dreams, fears and ambitions are all things I could easily describe.

Much like Suicide Squad, the film makes the wise decision of using its vast and diverse gallery of characters to bring in a wondrous array of different visual styles. We have the urban graffiti style of Miles Morales, the 60s Marvel style of Peter Benjamin Parker, the Marvel Now! style of Spider-Gwen, the Golden Age comics style of Spider-Man: Noir, the Acme style of Spider-Ham and the anime style of Peni Parker. It's no secret that the film's core message is that anyone with a big spine and a bigger heart can be Spider-Man, but what makes Into the Spider-Verse so impressive is that, like the best comic books, it conveys this all visually. Every one of these different styles gets their own spot in the sunlight and I feel that every viewer will find a style here that really touches them on a personal level, just as each viewer is likely to find a Spider-Man here who they can relate too and resonate with emotionally. Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse isn't merely a great comic book movie, it's a comic book brought to life.

I'll always have appreciation for soundtracks that really capture the musical tastes of a specific generation. They almost act as cultural time capsules of the time in which they were released. Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse very much fits this description, featuring some of the best and most atmospheric songs of Post Malone, Juice Wrld, Seezyn, XXTentacion, Swae Lee and Annuel AE's careers. I haven't loved a soundtrack to a comic book movie this much since Spawn. Just like that film, Into The Spider-Verse's soundtrack really captures the musical atmosphere of the late 2010s. It just set such an emotional tone for the film, one that's very much earned with this excellent and moving screenplay.

Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse is easily the best superhero film of 2018 and its place as the 2nd best Marvel film to date is unlikely to be unseated by anything else. It's a must see for anyone with even a remote love for the character and it completely makes up for the terrible depictions of Spider-Man in both Captain America: Civil War and Spider-Man: Homecoming. It's nice to see my faith (Or, relative faith over Marvel studios, at least) rewarded.",a5yi33

My only regret is that I didn't see it in 3D. I'll be rectifying that very soon. Unbelievable animation, great voice acting. The jokes that were there all hit. The soundtrack was awesome, despite being music I normally don't listen to. Seriously, 10/10 for me. Highest recommendation I can give.

ebt5khc,"Everyone's said it, this is an absolutely wonderful movie that's such a pleasure to sit through. It had great moments, it's visually spectacular, and it had well developed characters.


I do have a slight gripe in their characterization of Gwen here. Notably, it's how Peter doesn't seem to react that Gwen's there and vice versa. In her comics it was a pretty important part of her back story that Peter died trying to become just like her Spider alter ego. And in Spider-Man, well the death of Gwen Stacy was an important hallmark of the age.


It's true that the age difference may feel weird, and that this Peter is facing more focus with MJ, but I wouldve liked to see it addressed.

And this is by far my favourite animated film this year. It was so funny, serious when it was needed to be. Not so pushy with references like Ralph. Meta yet understandable even for non marvel fans like me.

What a show. If the plot was a little more flushed out and less expected, it would be perfect. I know... Superhero and animated movies have to sort of follow the formula because of kids and their expectations... But with such a meta film, I could see it being less expected.

Real happy with it and hope they can do another with such quality. ",a5yi33

The movie even goes as far as poking fun at the PP origin and I think that was the best call.

I could go on all day about each character and their arcs too, every one has their time to shine, every character who has an effect on the plot is given some kind of emotional weight. I love this movie.

The only real criticism I have is I wish I knew more about why the Prowler... well, Prowled, but that can fly into nitpick territory tbh",a5yi33

ec7ty39,"Genuinely great movie, saw it on Saturday. I loved the way they made everything feel so real even though it’s one of the first non live action marvel films in a while. The movie itself also having a really good art style and direction and the mixing of different art styles was surprisingly fluid and didn’t feel to strange. Animators absolutely outdid themselves with their attention to detail and the Album was really good as well, Lil Wayne, Ty Dolla $ign and X’s song standing out to me.

Whether it be intentionally cringe moments in school or showing Mile’s relationship with his family, everything felt very real with how it subverted tropes without being while still staying true to who Spider-Man is. I love the way they hammered home the point that the Amazing Spider-Man movies were trying to do away with though. That anyone could’ve been Spider-Man.


Highlights of the movie were [How touching New York’s reaction to Peter Parker’s death was](#spoiler), Nic Cage, everything with Prowler in it, and most important Kingpin. The colossal chap was so incredibly wide that he took up the entire screen in a few of the shots of the movie. My only issue with it was that pretty much any scene he appeared in my it was so comical that it could take the emotional value out of some of the scenes he was in. [When Kingpin murdered Peter Parker I was conflicted between laughter because of how wide he was and sadness because I watched Spider-Man die.](#spoiler) 

Most of the time my friends and I were busy wheezing at the size of the lad so it wasn’t a big deal, but it did kill a few powerful moments.


I’d give this movie a 8.9/10, really fucking good. My ideal sequel would be having a more stand-alone Miles storyline and maybe throwing Spider-Gwen in it.

Edit: Looks like the post-credits scene was removed in China where I saw it. Not a verifiable source, but a friend in the industry told me that the Chinese censors made a request to cut the extra scene. No idea why.

Also, do the main characters use Tencent QQ Messenger on their phones as in the version I saw? QQ Messenger is a Chinese messenger app not unlike WhatsApp, has a penguin for a logo and message tones are a distinctive five beeps in succession.

I watched the movie in 3D. But frequently throughout the movie there were scenes where images in either the background or foreground were in blurry double-vision, the same way an image looks if you're not wearing your 3D glasses.

I know my 3D glasses worked, because most of the movie was still in proper 3D. But I kept seeing these scenes where it was like the movie expected me to put on a second pair of 3D glasses.

Was this an intentional thing, or was my theatre not displaying the movie properly?",a5yi33

This movie reminded me a lot of the Lego Batman movie in how self-referential it is to all the other takes on Spider-Man in pop culture. I thought it was neat how Gwen's ""origin story"" was sort of a nod to the Andrew Garfield movie, but with all the roles reversed and switched up (Peter is killed by the Lizard, but she saves her dad). I'm not sure I caught any references to Homecoming, but I would guess they have one somewhere.

Loved the character design. I grew up wearing AJ1s, so watching Spider-Man swing around in a pair of Chicago’s brought out my inner child. There were a ton of “in your face” similarities to Miles story and the other spider men here, but the way they were shown made them feel like they were subtle.

The characters, the art, the animation, everything about this movie was amazing. I was a bit meh initially towards this movie when the first trailer dropped, but boiii was I wrong.

I left the theatre feeling all kinds of inspired. Both as a big time Spiderman fan and as an aspiring Digital Artist. 🙌🏼",a5yi33
edoq6hs,"Rewatched for the fourth time and yes they definitely have some product placement for China specifically though it's pretty blink and you will miss it as it only appeared twice that I noticed. The use of the Chinese messenger service [QQ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent_QQ) when miles messages Aaron and on the subway when miles closed the phone app.

Also maybe I am seeing things but during Peter b Parker scene for the electric shock looked like the clone high Abraham Lincoln

The scene where Aaron dies while sad seems to suffer a minor continuity error in the background with the dad's police car driving past the alley but the next time we see it he has already parked right outside the alley with a direct line of sight of Miles and Aaron's body but previously his car already drove past it 

Edit 

During the scene with Peter B Parker is eating in the diner. You can see a C rating for the health inspection score. Probably why it closed. 

How did Doc Ock catch up so fast when Spiderman and Miles were swinging past a few trees already ? You see Doc Ock picking herself up after spiderman knocked her down. Extremely close to where Spiderman and Miles fell on the tree branch and trying to save the computer 

You can spot most likely Gwen Stacey earlier in the film when Miles first enters the academy you see her standing with her back to the camera. After Miles had to say I love you back to his dad.  

The original miles spiderman lair has a blender by his computer screen. Just thought that was an amusing appliance to have. 

Why do they keep yelling miles name in front of everyone.

I liked how right before Aunt May takes the bat to Tombstone you see the destruction of her house and one of them is just spider Ham smashing one of her plates on his head lol.

Noir Spiderman had a white bowtie and everyone else had black was a nice touch

I have two kind of major gripes but I can tolerate them. I really like Kingpin's motivation here but boy is he wasted. I was incredibly disappointed with the villain here especially given how great the rest of the film is - it almost seemed like they cared more about Doctor Octopus than the main villain.

I'm also kind of mixed on how early they killed the first Spider-Man. it had to happen, but I don't know, I would have liked to see more from him. He had a great personality, like he's *the* Spider-Man you know and love.",a5yi33

ebr08hc,"So I don't know if I accidentally watched the 3d version or not. For the most part it looked great but for a lot of scenes everything was blurry and the final fight scene physically made my eyes hurt. I bought a 2d ticket and no one in my theater had glasses on but in thick the theater screwed up. 

But the movie itself was amazing. Aunt May was my favorite part. The only gripe I had, while minor, was Mary Jane. So Aunt May knew everything, MJ knew about spiderman and Peter, yet she didn't know about Kingpin? Also I get not recognizing Peter in the suit but she didn't even recognize her husband's voice? The whole short dinner scene threw me off. There is only one spiderwoman in this universe, that even kingpin knows about, and no one calls her out? 

Still 9/10 movie",a5yi33

I really hope this movie is successful because it's genuinely good and it deserves to be, but I doubt that it can exceed projections bc most people will see the poster and think ""cartoon Spiderman movie = kid movie"".

ebxmz21,"So having JUST seen this movie, I absolutely loved it.  Even with the hype and high expectations, and being an incredibly biased Peter Parker fan (I was initially incredibly un-receptive to Ultimate  Miles and Superior Spider-Man purely because they had to replace Parker), I thought this movie was wonderful. I'll have to wait until my initial excitement has worn off before I can assess if it was objectively good or just good in the eyes of a fan (though out of the 3 other friends I saw it with, 2 had no prior interest in Spider-Man and both said they really enjoyed it).

Just two thoughts:

&#x200B;

1. Both Miles' Spider-Man and the Thicke-Spider-Man reference the Raimi movies in their backstories (Miles' had the train scene, the Spider-Man 3 dance and riffs on the upside-down kiss, while older Spidey seemed to just have the kiss and I didn't notice anything else in the montage).  I'd heard that one of them is meant to represent the Raimi Spider-Man; is this actually the case?  Or do both just have homages and neither is intended to truly represent that character?
2. Miles (and countless others) have Spider-Man comic books accurately depicting Peter Parker gaining his powers, well before he dies and his identity becomes public knowledge.  Did anyone else find this a little weird?

&#x200B;",a5yi33
eby7eov,I didn’t think a movie would top Ralph Breaks the Internet for me this year. This movie did that easily. Using all 3 of this weeks AMC passes in this one. ,a5yi33

ebytvrg,"Saw it again tonight - this time in IMAX 3D. It's rare that I'll go for 3D and this was worth it. 

The second time around I got to pick up on little details like the word ""BAGEL"" being shown when Miles hits the henchmen with the bagel, and Spider-ham's nostril eyes matching the shape of his eye eyes whenever he emoted through them.

I'm curious why they left the black and white outfit out of the Spider-shed gallery of costumes? Even though it was a symbiote originally, the comic Spidey had a regular version he used every so often.  ",a5yi33

Don’t get me wrong, the movie doesn’t drop the ball or anything, but I guess I wasn’t really interested in the actual plot - the storyline of an interdimensional device that Fisk was trying to use to get his family back, and the quick intros of the other spider-“people” that didn’t really go anywhere other than setting them up for some jokes. What I did care about was Miles. Miles, his dad, and his uncle. And I had no previous introduction of any kind to Miles Morales. But that was the story I wanted to see.

It didn’t really pan out that way, but no worries. I had an amazing time at the theatre. I laughed so much, I could not stop grinning when Miles started to come into his own and have control over his powers, I could not get over how gorgeous this movie looked, and those Stan Lee moments made my theatre sigh in unison.

Also, I watched it in 3D, which is something I normally actively avoid. But man oh man was it worth it in this movie. Definitely recommend it, as it really gives that extra depth of immersion this movie is trying to project.

Also also, what were those terrible Sony trailers before the movie? I got a trailer about a dog trying to find her way home, a movie I think is called “Overcomer” (coming out AUGUST 2019!), and then the Shazam trailer (which was still a pretty darn great trailer). I think there may have been another weird Sony trailer in there too. And honestly, every trailer (apart from Shazam) felt like a C-list movie that should be played on the Hallmark channel... what’s up with that, Sony?",a5yi33

animation 10/10 

storyline 9/10 ( it was different, but still predictable )

overall it's one of the best films I've seen in a while, Not once did I look down to use my phone, I was intuned throughout the entire film. Absolutely loved it. What I loved most was the animation, even the way the writers incorporated porky pig. It was borderline frightening but was absolutely needed to drive home the point that ANYONE can become spiderman once the mask is on. ",a5yi33
ebqxg2u,"Went in knowing I was going to love the animation.

Left stunned that I had just seen what is certainly the best Spider-Man film ever created and is in the conversation for best superhero film of all time.

The animators absolutely nailed every scene, I physically couldn't look away.

And the writers hit the home run by just having the perfect knowledge of each character at their disposal, how to set up emotional, inspiring, comedic and action moments that hit and fit the personalities of each bad guy, spider person and side character.

10/10 cannot wait to watch this movie again.",a5yi33

No film, not one, has better captured being a comic-book than this, not just visually, but in the story. It was so big and expansive, but still so small and intimate. Two scenes in this are on my top 5 for the year, and the movie doesn't stand a shot at getting knocked out of my 5 of the year. Its an absolute knockout ",a5yi33

A fat, washed up Parker passing on the torch is something I personally wanted for a while. I hope this gets a sequel but Aquaman is soaking up the box office. What absolute hack fraudery to fire Lord and Miller from Star Wars.

I also hope I'm not alone in saying this, but Spider-Ham really felt out of place and kind of broke immersion for me in the parts that he was in. It's just such a random character. It doesn't fit. And it seems like they just threw it in to make it funny.",a5yi33

I do have one question though and it was bothering me throughout the movie.

ec2v6lx,"There were a few problems with the movie for me, but it really shattered my expectations for how good this movie was going to be, and I already assumed it would be great just from word of mouth.  Absolutely gorgeous film with fantastic editing, acting, and such a hardcore origin story (lol).  The direction, especially in the fight scenes was phenomenal and they really made this movie feel like it **had** to be done in animated fashion for them to accomplish what they did.  I never felt like this movie would have benefited from being live-action or anything other than what it was.  Miles was a great character as well--while he technically did learn quite fast, you could feel him struggling to come to grips with his power, and the fact that he incorporated everything that his fellow Spider people and family had taught him into the 3rd act was great.  I was worried Miles would take a backseat to Peter and Gwen but I definitely felt like he was the emotional center of this movie and that I was fully invested into his story.  

I also really liked how they didn't really try to beat us over the head with Peter B's depression.  Yeah, they do a little sequence where they eventually end it in showing him crying in his suit in the shower but it is mostly played for laughs.  But you can feel his exhaustion and it is clear that he is more than ok with dying.  But they don't take away from Miles at all in order to show that, you just kind of accept it and the vulnerability he shows before returning to his universe when he asks Miles ""How do I know I won't mess it up again?"" hit me so hard.  It made the final sequence that much more uplifting because you felt like the relationship between them went both ways in terms of what they learned from each other.  I have pretty much nothing but praise for everything else, but here are the only few glaring issues I had with it.

The beginning is definitely awkward in pace.  The school stuff in general was pretty hit-or-miss and it did feel like it took a while to really find itself.  But once you get to the first fight sequence, it just ascends.  I was impressed with how much impact Peter's death had.  The only other criticisms I have are pretty nitpicky since I felt like some of the humor/jokes kinda missed but by kinda I mean there was like a 98% success rate (in particular, I felt like the delivery of the ""Hey"" on Kingpin was fairly forced and awkward even ignoring how stupid Kingpin was to let that happen).  Also, did anyone else not give 2 shits about the robot's ""death""?  Felt kind of strange how much attention they gave to that but then again I don't really know much about Peni Parker so maybe that just flew over my head.  

It's definitely a must see.  Seriously, it's easily one of the best films of the year.  ",a5yi33
ec4yjg7,"Did my second viewing last night, this time in IMAX 3D.
Some added thoughts:

1. It hit me on my second viewing that the art style is a perfect intersection of classic, 3D and stop-motion animation with comic book and live-action sensibilities sprinkled in. The style was fresh and the easter-eggs kept coming, it'll be a buffet for the frame-by-framers at /r/MovieDetails.

2. Sony pushed for some pretty egregious product placement, so props to the  music department for producing a dope soundtrack and to the filmmakers for managing to make it fit in the story - the music being so current may date the movie one day, and I'm sure the directors would have preferred more throwback hip-hop, but it's a decent compromise.
3. The scene where Miles falls and lands on the goober drew a big reaction from the crowd both nights I saw it - really a testament to the effectiveness of the story telling. Even the Prowler reveal, which any comic reader is familiar with, was pretty well done and didn't give itself away. I haven't seen a crowd this invested in a movie for a minute.",a5yi33

This movie was just so great. As a fan I was emotional about it and to see everything with Stan was heartwarming....but cmon. THE POST CREDIT MEME WAS SPECTACULAR!",a5yi33
ebqttsa,AWESOME MOVIE. END CREDITS. STAY FOR THEM!,a5yi33
ebqu6e3,"Honestly my only critique of this movie is that we didn’t get enough of Noir, Ham and Peni. What we saw in the trailers is pretty much all they had in the movie. 

Hopefully that is fixed in the sequel. 

But I totally get that this is Miles’ movie and the movie is already 2 hours long and full of other stuff. Great stuff mind you. So stuff had to be cut. Hopefully there’s an extended version or something on home release that shows them off a bit more. ",a5yi33

ebr435b,"This movie is *phenomenal*.  3D is worth it, the story is great, the animation is weird and awesome (basically a 2D comic book pulled out into 3D, complete with shading lines for shadows and color dots for gradients), the soundtrack is well-done, the characters and voice acting are great (I particularly enjoyed when I figured out it was Nicolas Cage as Spider-Noir).  Definitely make sure to stay past the credits too.",a5yi33

The animation, the cinematography, the sound design, the score, the soundtrack, EVERYTHING! It was so good! I was mesmerized immediately from the title cards haha I knew it would be something special. Also, something I've never experienced before happened in this showing: During the scene in which Miles decides to push off doing his ""Expectations"" essay and he starts bumping music, the bass in the theater progressively got stronger as the scene went, and right when he turned up the stereo, the Dolby Digital seats began to vibrate in sync with the bass! It was so dope! I was head noddin like crazy feeling like I was at a concert haha I just really loved the entire experience and the way they used EVERYTHING they could think of! Truly awesome.  


Also, loved that the gave Spider-Ham a chance to shine in a fight towards the end lol",a5yi33

ebs1fwq,"I loved every minute of it. 
It struck all the right notes and I have so many adjectives to describe it. Every one of those is positive. Best adjective is kinetic. I loved how it all moved. I saw 2d, but made it feel like 4dx. (my next viewing tomorrow will be that format).
Lots of characters and so many things going on, but balanced so well that it didnt' feel over-stuffed and plotted nor like bare sketches of characters. Every character was well drawn - metaphorically and literally. Spider-Man Noirs quips were amazing ... Where I go, the wind follows. And the wind smells like... rain. 
The multiple forms of animation types interacting was wonderful and helped keep the action clear. 
Honestly, I cried a few times. Stan's cameo was a given for that, but for some of the other emotional beats. And at the end for happiness at what I saw - I didn't even realize I was until my wife pointed it out.
Speaking of Stan. Fitting his best creation is his first posthumous cameo. Touching.
It's my new favorite movie of the year, unseating the tie of Hereditary and Eighth Grade.

Like didn't Peter ever tell her that Kingpin was a villain? Or like she neve found out that Kingpin killed Peter?",a5yi33

I loved seeing the references to other movies. And I really don't know my music because I thought I was hearing Childish Gambino singing but it was someone else (it was the song Elevate). But still great stuff.

The animation was just great, all different styles. Of course some images ~~thwip~~ flit by quicker than my eyes can see. Ah well.",a5yi33

All I can say is I saw it in 3d and every second of it was beautiful.

Every frame a work of art. It was really incredible.

I loved all the attention to detail whether it be the references to a larger universe, Easter eggs, characters interacting perfectly, and the goddamn gorgeous cel-shaded comic book themed art direction. The action was so frenetic and colorful, and the humor was just relentless but in a good way, not in an annoying quippy way (looking at you Age of Ultron).

Aaron put Miles' mask back on for two things: to protect him and to let Miles know that he really is a hero and there's nobody who is a better fit to be one. Aaron wanted to encourage him to keep going. Also, Aaron knew he was going to die once he realized who Miles was. He'd rather die than kill his own nephew. Very heavy. This film handled it so well.

ecrrg3n,"This was fantastic. It's actually the first movie since I first saw Aliens at 16 where I ended up forgetting to finish my movie candy!

It was almost *perfect* for me, and I really only had three gripes, two of them very minor:

1. Minor - Unpopular opinion, but I didn't like the design of Kingpin - it was just *too* grotesque and out of line with the rest of the character design. He was a caricature in a world of cartoons, and felt as 'out of place' in Miles's universe as Spider-Ham.

2. Super-minor: *No* reaction whatsoever from OG-Peter to seeing Gwen? I know he's super-preoccupied with what he's going through with MJ and that it's been 20+ years, but I still expected *some* kind of reaction when Peter realized who she were.

And then to my one *major* gripe - the low framerate character animation.

I know it was an artistic choice, and I guess I understand what they were 'going for', but it was *horrendously distracting and annoying* to me and did not ""work"" at all. Had the movie not been *so damn good* in every other aspect, it might have pulled me out of it completely.

I can't stand 'motion comics'. I generally don't like anime - and one of the things that's always put me off was the cheap, jerky low-framerate animation common in a lot of 'older' anime.

Perhaps the low frame-rate character animation here is easy to ingore for viewers who grew up with 'cheap' low-framerate cartoons, or perhaps even 'enjoyed' by some by some nostalgic mechanism, but I really hope the filmmakers understand that there's a subsection of their audience for whom this is nothing but distracting, and actually detracts significantly from an otherwise near-perfect movie.",a5yi33

ecawosq,"I loved everything about this movie. I thought the animation was both unlike any animation I've ever seen and extremely effective in making it everything fun and dynamic that a spiderman movie should be. I thought the emotional core of this was so much better than like every MCU movie (some by a landslide, some by a hair), and I think Jake Johnson was born to play a mid-life-crisis Peter Parker.

My only complaint is with the [arc with Uncle Andre. I understood the bit about losing someone and I liked how it brought him closer to his dad and everything. I liked that Andre believed in him when his dad didn't (sort of). But did I miss something or did they just totally not explain why Andre was working for Fisk? I wanted to know why he was working for the bad guy, and more importantly I wanted to watch Miles try to wrestle with that too.] (#spoiler)

Still, the movie was familiar, without painfully going AGAIN through the obnoxious ""spiderbite / ben dies / may is great"". Especially considering that they have multiple spiderman. They do give some space for each character to grow, without going through massive origin stories that we don't really care about because we know it by now.

That reminded me of Incredible Hulk which didn't bother going through a huge origin story because it's pointless : everybody knows who spiderman is :)

Visually it's stunning, although they used some tricks on framerate which feel a bit disconnected at times (go from stop motion style to super smooth). Also a bit too much chromatic aberation, feels like JJ lens flares because of how much they over use the effect. Although in this case it makes some sense.

Soundtrack was great too, it feels strongly connected to the movie. I am not a hiphop fan so I listened to it after and I don't really enjoy it, but in the movie it totaly worked.

Remember when Avatar was being marketed and it was being described as some visual extravaganza, the likes of which had never been seen before?
Then it turned out... like meh?

This film, visually, is what I expected Avatar to be. I know it's an animated feature, but the art is absolutely nuts. I'm confident that there has never been a film like this. Its shocking how mind boggling it can be, yet it remains artful and cohesive. 

The script is sharp and compelling. The central spidey characters are very well developed. I only wish some of the others like Spider-noir and Peter Porker had gotten more scenes.

ebwbgkl,"I had some pretty enormous expectations, given that the initial trailers blew my mind earlier in the year.

I gotta say, this movie absolutely killed it. The animation was simply breaktaking and every member of the voice cast had an excellent performance. Nicolas Cage and John Mulany in particular both had show-stealing lines and delivery. 

I would have personally enjoyed a slightly different take on King Pin, but I'm a little biased coming off of the Spider-Man PS4 interation. I would have also perferred to spend a little bit more time with the Miles Universe Peter Parker, but the characterization of his Aunt May was a surprisingly fresh take that more than picked up the slack. 

I'm in disbelief that the same studio that brought us the Emoji Movie also gave us what is arguably the best Spider-Man movie as well. Honestly, this one is right up there Raimi's Spider-Man/Spider-Man 2 and the MCEU's Homecoming. 


I can't wait to see it again and I'll definitely be picking this one up on Blu-Ray. I have a feeling that seeing this in 4K HDR is going to be a real treat.

ebw5cc1,"... Wow.

Let me preface this by saying that I went in to this with tempered expectations. Yes the trailers have been outstanding and the reviews have praised it as the coming of Spider-Christ but I didn’t want to overhype it or ruin it for myself. That being said, WOW! WOW!!!!! Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse is a perfectly animated, perfectly written, perfectly voiced, perfectly... PERFECT movie from top to bottom. I was absolutely floored when the credits came to a close and had I not been with a big group of friends, I would’ve walked right up to the ticket stand, purchased a ticket to the next earliest showing and walked right back into the theatre. It’s seriously THAT GOOD.

The animation is the most unique, dynamic, entrancing piece of art I have ever seen. The blended animation styles of all the different spider people, the constant frame jumps that are noticeable yet still serve the movie so well, the comic panels that pop up from time to time just GAUGGGH this movie looks TOO good! It has no business looking this good! 

The voice acting is top notch from all involved, with Miles’(actor name is escaping me) being the biggest stand out and Jake Johnson coming at a close second. Everyone is great though, and it also helps that they have been given an outstandingly witty, heartfelt and hilarious script. Every character had a chance to shine, every Spider person, side character, villain had at least one memorable line(notice how I said AT LEAST!)

The soundtrack is also incredible too, each song matching the tone of its current scene to perfection. My personal favourites have gotta be What’s Up Danger and Sunflower. 

My only, potential, MICROSCOPIC complaint that I may have with this movie is that it does feel like it moves a slight bit too slow in the beginning, but even now looking back at it, that slow beginning was needed for:

A) The breakneck pace the movie reaches after alternate Peter Parker arrives.

B) To establish the powerful relationships between Miles and his father/uncle, which all come to a head at their respective times with flawless emotion and pure heart. 

Other than that though, I have absolutely zero complaints with this movie. Please for the love of all things good in this world, SEE THIS MOVIE! LET IT MAKE MONEY! CAUSE IF THIS IS ALREADY THIS GOOD THAN WE ALL SHOULD SEE MORE! 

10/10, best movie I’ve seen all year, hands down. 




...

P.S. That after credits scene is the best I’ve ever seen.





...

P.P.S. The tribute to Stan Lee and Steve Ditko at the mid-credits portion was touching and classy. Rest In Peace guys, you will live on for forever in the hearts and minds of comic book fans everywhere. ",a5yi33

Peter B.'s arc about kids was good, Miles' arc with finding out who he wants to be, I loved the grand theme of ""anyone can be Spider-Man"", which is just beautiful. All the different universes were great, performances were great, the filmmaking craft in this was amazing, the soundtrack was really good (how can you hate on a soundtrack with Biggie, c'mon). The only thing I outright disliked was Kingpin. He looked like Gru and his story wasn't super compelling for me.

A lot of it was really emotional tho, like Peter's death aftermath, and Miles and the last Prowler scene. Just completely wonderful. ",a5yi33
ebwc401,"I am not a big superhero movie person at all - personally, I actively avoid super hero movies since I feel like to be able to understand one superhero film ya gotta have watched all the previous ones - but this movie was damn entertaining and I loved it! And the only Spider-Man movies (actually, superhero movies in general) I have watched were the 1st SpiderMan movie w/ Toby McGuire and Spider Man Homecoming. 


The artwork/how it looked was ABSOLUTELY beautiful for every scene (I watched it in 3D). Every background and movement looked SO COOL!!! The colours were magnificent and character designs were neat. Honestly, the entire movie felt like comic book was precisely transposed onto the big screen. It was just so *cool* looking! I loved the little extra details like the written words of the sounds that are made come on screen in that classic comic book font. 

The Voice work was neat. It was absolutely awesome to hear Lily Tomlin as Aunt May. Although John Mulaney barely had any lines, all of them were funny. And Spider Man Noir may be the best character in this entire movie. Everything that came out of Cage's character's mouth was bloodly hilarious and so in tune with a detective from the 1930's. 

The soundtrack is GREAT!!! Really does a good job at setting the tone. For sure I'll be looking up the soundtrack on spotify.

Emotions wise: this movie had it all. Edge of the seat moments that fill you with ""will he, won't he??? What's gonna happen??"". There were like three scenes that I can think of off the top of my head that hit me in the feels (all while doing an excellent job to establish characters/backstory), there were some hilarious moments (two of which reduced me to tears: both of them were lines or moments from Spider Man Noir). The action scenes were all interesting and felt like there were some real stakes, while also doing a good job at  fitting in funny moments without detracting from the action. 


My one strife is that I felt like a bit more time could have been spent establishing the main villain's motive. There were a few flashback scenes that alluded as to why he's a cunt, but still, I walked outta the theater a bit confused. Who is this man that is built like a deep freezer??? Also, I anticipate that this movie won't age very well and that is largely due to the soundtrack being such a product of the current hip-hop/trap culture.  But I suppose that can be said of any evolution of a music genre. 


",a5yi33
ec180fd,"Loved this film a lot. Not too much exposition, packed with action, stuck to the nature of spider man, humorous and knew when to tone down the humor and be serious. The animation could not have been more perfect, so gorgeous and unique and captures the comic feel, it’s so aesthetically pleasing.

The character development behind miles is some of the best I’ve seen in a film. Every frame, every shot, all was important, what makes the movie even more impressive is just the level of passion and dedication involved with animating each frame and making all the acts mesh well together.

I cannot think of anyway the film could have been better, strong characters, art direction, story flow, climax, world building, there’s so much more potential for this film’s world to be expanded on, it’s absolutely an excellent film and is undoubtedly my favorite spider man film of all time.",a5yi33
ec197uu,I really loved this!  It felt original and honored the character incredibly well.  Honestly I’m more invested in Miles’ story than Peter’s (MCU).  It blew Homecoming out of the water IMO.  Just hope they don’t ruin this with countless sequels and unnecessary spinoffs.,a5yi33

The love paid to the source made me so happy. Smiled so hard everytime SpiderHam did a classic cartoon reference or I got to sit in awe at how animeish the little Asian girl with the spider robot looked despite being CGI made me smile.

The reason I bring this up is because there were two parts in this movie that really got to me and that I wanted him to take to heart.

ebt3rcp,"I just saw it today and really enjoyed it. The art is absolutely amazing; the animation, the mix of 3d with a lot of 2d elements, the colors, everything was so freaking good. One stand out for me personally was when Miles was walking through school with his new heightened senses, I thought that whole segment was a really good depiction of having high anxiety. At least in my case, lol.

&#x200B;

I have a question though. I saw the regular 2d version, but there seemed to be that kind of 3d effect on characters in backgrounds/ the sides of the screen where it was 2 images kind of ghosting. I was wondering if maybe the theater had accidentally screened the 3d version in my theater, or was this just a stylistic thing, if anybody else had something similar during their 2d showing? If it was stylistic, that would be my only minor nitpick about the art, cause I wanted to see more of the amazing character design more clearly.",a5yi33

That being said, this movie is really good with stunning animation (the comic book integration and the final showdown), decent plot coupled with well-written Miles and Peter Parker Sr along with able side-characters to boot, unexpected cameos and reveals and equally balanced hilarious and painful moments, along with an excellent soundtrack to boost.

eddjhn2,"There's just one thing that's been bugging me about this because I walked out of the movie thinking *Haven't I seen this before?* and it turns out... I have. A similar storyline was played out in *Ultimate Spider-Man* with this storyline called *Web Warriors* and its follow-up *Return to the Spider-Verse*. And basically, I'm actually tossing up which one I think did the whole Spider-Verse story better.

I mean - both media feature a plot involving two Spider-Man villains working together on a cross-dimensional gateway, and both feature appearances from perhaps the top fan-fave alt-universe Spider-Men i.e. Spider-Gwen/Spider-Woman, Spider-Man Noir and Spider-Ham (as well as Miles Morales and Miguel O'Hara of course). 

What is your opinion guys? What are the pros and cons to how the movie and the TV series juggled the Spider-Verse plot?

Also of note, the *Ultimate Spider-Man* storyline was also tied up to the Spider-Man comics and brought in pretty much every other alt-universe Spider-Man we know (except for the MCU one obviously).

I guess it's fun to think of this movie actually being the prequel to *Web Warriors* but of course, that's just speculation/head-canon.",a5yi33

Though there was one serious missed opportunity for a touching moment that didn't happen.

Old Peter didn't recognize Gwen Stacy.

There wasn't even a ""Gwen, you're alive?"" moment. Of course it's not the same Gwen that died in his universe, but still it would be natural to have that reaction seeing your ex girlfriend who died being alive.

My partner, who's a big MCU fan (and we make each new MCU movie a big family event), dismissed this straight out of hand with a ""but its a cartoon"".  
No amount of ""but you love the Lion king and that's a cartoon"" or ""its by the Lego batman guys, you loved that!"" Managed to sway her. In her mind, its a Spider-man cartoon. Like the ones we used to get on TV (i know i know, they were awesome too and i'd well pay to see a feature length version even now). And because of that, its not a film that should be in the cinema.  
   
My work-mates are going this week to see Aquaman. I know, just from trailers and a minor amount of general poll reading, as far as films go, Into the spiderverse is likely going to be 20 times the film Aquaman stands a chance of being. Yet i know, if i were to suggest they go see that instead, it will fall on deaf ears and Jason Samosa's chest will drum up the ratings and money for Aquaman while into the spiderverse slips by most of them un-noticed.",a5yi33

Everything from the storyboard, art direction, colors, fight scenes was phenomenal and I have never seen anything like this before. The music was perfect tbh, it put you in the tension of the scene.

Penny Parker was cute af BTW. This film is a 10/10",a5yi33
ecgs06k,"The only possible negative I could think of is the soundtrack certainly isn't for me and seemed to clash tonally at times, and maybe that people are conveniently in the same place a few too many times.

Other than that, I loved everything about it, the character design especially (imo a perfect blend of cartoon-like and realistic), the characters themselves (I really liked this version of >!Doc Ock!<), the animation that truly felt like if comic books were on a screen, the voice acting (especially by Jake Johnson), the plot that never gets too heavy handed, the camerawork (especially during the action scenes), and of course the references that never overstayed their welcome (my favorite obviously being >!the post-credit scene that references the meme!<).

I think they were bullshitting so they didn’t have to do anything but I’m pissed. It was so good I wish I could’ve seen it normally

EDIT: Turns out I'm not the only one so I guess it was intentional. Didn't have an issue with the blue/red bits in the background but rather the blurs like "" V I S I O N "" on the campus catwalk and stuff like that.

Definitely the best Spider-Man movie and I'm not sure it will ever be undone. The writing and editing was just perfect throughout. Never a jarring cut in tone or narrative.

With that said, everything about this movie was extremely well done. I am so glad that I got dragged to go see it at 10:45pm. The animation was probably the most unique thing I've seen in the last 10 years as far as visuals go. Never been done before, and now I could not imagine it being executed any other way. It was a perfect adaptation of a comic book to 3D-movie form. Characters were great, well acted, and I was genuinely laughing out loud at several moments. Writing rock solid.

I can’t wait to see what this team comes up with in terms of a sequel, a strong start to say the least. ",a5yi33

This film did so many things right and i'm hoping for a sequel. My only 2 grumbles is that it seems they made this on a weird frame rate as I felt the action scenes were a bit jerky, especially at the start.

ebu8cne,"Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse is an amazing film. The animation style is phenomenal and its easily one of the best looking animated films ever. It literally feels like a comic book in motion, popping to life. The art and cinematography oozes with style hence there are a lot of amazing action sequences and breathtaking trippy visuals in this film. But its not just merely a visual spectacle. It also is a really heartwarming origin story for a new Spider-Man.

With witty dialog poking fun at superhero tropes and past Spider-man history and visual inventiveness, there is a lot of heart, humour and character development in this film. Miles Morales has rightfully earned his place as Spider-Man alongside Peter Parker. The only flaw of the film is that its too short. I want to see more of this Spider-Man or more multiverse Spider-Man animated in this style.

I never thought any other Spider-man film would top the OG Raimi Spider-man films. But Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse just did.

He said the web-swinging/flight scenes went for too long, and I disagreed, with the exception of the final battle, in which I started to wonder, how long would it take, with real-world science applied, for that whole process to take place? Certainly not as long as that sequence. **Even still, I thought this movie was very, *very* well-made given Sony's track record as of late, and it spoke to me on many levels as a Spider-Man fan myself.**

And now, a couple of fun observations:

1. This movie made me think about how fun it would be to play as Spider-Man in a Super Smash Bros. game. Imagine getting to play as 8 different Spider-people (including the 6 from the movie), each one with their own different abilities in addition to a primary, shared moveset. Just something fun I came up with.

It does something that other recent Spider-Man movies have avoided doing, namely letting Peter Parker grow up and making way for new characters to wear the mask. The timing couldn't be better for Miles. In the same year that Black Panther made over a billion dollars, this movie shows his potential as a character. It was truly special.

 I also think some characters didn't get enough spotlight, Prowler for example, I didn't care too much when he died tbh. I would've loved more Spider-Man Noir too. 

I wasn't a huge fan of Chris Pine's Peter Parker and got a bit worried at the beginning, was very delighted when we got that other dude instead - he was great. Loved everything about that character.

So my question is, if this is indeed that universe, why is there a second doc oc in the form of Liv? Unless it can be explained by the  dimension hopping and I just didn't notice it.",a5yi33

ebqurry,"Stan Lee's cameo hit me really hard, not gonna lie. Not only was that scene touching due to his recent passing, it also perfectly sums up why Spidey is so special and significant to us all. He isn't just a guy in a mask, he was a symbol, and ideal for all of us to strive to become.

ebqvsj3,"Everyone's already said pretty much what was on my mind, overall I absolutely loved the film.

One of my favorite things was how much of an absolute unit Kingpin was, while definitely intimidating, my friend and I were laughing at him constantly especially >!in the final fight scene when Miles kind of throws him up in the air with a web and he looked like a Macy's Thanksgiving Parade balloon lmao!<

Honestly I don't really have a lot of issues with this film at all. One thing I kind of thought was iffy was the >!Prowler(?)(sorry not a big comic book reader) was revealed as Miles' uncle. I thought the beat was at the right time, I just didn't get why he had any reason to take off his hood at that exact time. Idk maybe it makes sense but I thought it was weird!<

Like I said though, I love it. The style was so incredible, and I gotta say this is one of those movies where, while the story is definitely great, I could sit through the movie just watching the animation. Mastapiece",a5yi33

That happened after Peter got his powers. But Gwen was there before he got his powers, like in school and in class with him? In her backstory she says she came through a portal and her spidey senses told her to go to Vision Academy. Did she come through at a different time than the rest of the Spider-people?",a5yi33

ebt4bf2,"Saw it early on 6th December and it blew my mind how good it was. Glad to see everyone else is feeling the same way. The animation was superb, everything flowed so nicely together, the soundtrack bangs and the humour was spot on. They really nailed Mile's Universe's Peter Parker from the few scenes we got with him.

They really captured the essence of Spidey and what it means to be Spider-man. Not ashamed to admit I shed a few tears during the emotional scenes.

The references/nods/easter eggs to comic readers and die hard Spidey fans were fantastic. It was also great how they made the movie accessible and really enjoyable to watch for people that knew nothing about the Spider-man mythos coming in. I took my little sister who outside of the Marvel cinematic universe (Civil war & Homecoming) didn't know anything about Spidey and she loved it.

With this, the video game, Homecoming and the next Marvel film coming out it's an exciting time to be a Web head!

I will say one or two predictable things didn't catch me off guard but their superhero movie tropes so I don't think they were meant to surprise the viewer as much as the characters in the movie itself. All in all, it was pretty good even though I didn't have any comic knowledge going in. It wasn't too meta and I think the animation was top notch. 8.5/10",a5yi33

I keep saying this it was like a comic book just came to life. the only thing I found a bit flat is the villain he was very predictable but maybe because they focused mainly on Miles's journey of becoming Spiderman and his relationship with his father and the other spiderman characters in the movie so the villain wasn't really their priority.

egw52m6,"I thought the movie was incredible. I've been finding myself getting cynical, especially over superhero movies, but this one hit all of the right notes. The comedy actually worked, and never seemed to get in the way of the emotional weight of what was going on. 

I loved the noir ""I let the matches burn down to my fingertips to so I can feel something, anything at all"" joke. 

I also loved that they didn't go full romance between Miles and Gwen. 

And as a weeb, I got straight up giddy when they introduced the Japanese anime spider man. 

But apparently I'm also a curmudgeon, because some of the rap music turned me off, especially the Nicki Minaj sounding thing that played over Japanese Spiderwoman when she fixed up a new goober. I would even have accepted J-Pop there, just something that fit with the archetype. I also thought spider-pig took the concept a little to far. These things are very minor, but somehow I cannot escape trying to ruin movies for myself as I watch them. Normally I don't like straight up genderbending, but Liv was my favorite Dock Ock yet, in every way. 

Still though, the movie kept blowing me away. I've mentioned a couple of things that I love, but there were moments like that constantly. Jokes, cinematography, general visuals. The music when Miles was hiding from his uncle was incredible sound design too. 

9/10. I can't wait to put some time between myself and the movie, and rewatch it without trying to pick it apart. ",a5yi33

I loved how they made all the main Spider-people (Miles, Peter B Parker, Gwen) seem more flawed than ever but at the same time trying to be better versions of themselves. Gwen and Peter are haunted by their past actions while Miles is clueless about where he is in this world and who he wants to be. The uncle's last moments were brutal and you could clearly see how he his filled with regret because he turned out to be a bad role model for Miles(Mahershala Ali did an amazing job like always). Honestly, I think the whole movie could be about MIles trying to find a mentor so that he can be a better version of himself but having to try to be better by himself rather than looking for it in Peter Parker, Peter B Parker, his uncle, or his dad. I found something honest and beautiful in this movie and I didn't expect that. 8/10",a5yi33

I was never a big fan of 3D movies but this one is one of the best ones I've seen. It honestly added to the whole experience of the movie. It helps they didn't do any of the cheesy 3D effect scenes you get in generic movies, like the ones where they reach out towards the viewer. All of the effects we're tastefully done and wonderful",a5yi33
ebuyacl,"The only thing I didn't like about this film was the quick, ""I love you all,"" by Spider-Noir and how Spider-Ham was tearfully sad over Peni's robot. YOU GUYS JUST MET EACH OTHER A FEW HOURS AGO! It reminded me of, ""I already lost my family. I am not going to lose another one,"" line from Suicide Squad. It felt a bit shallow and silly.

But, again, other than that I adored the movie. Miles was just such a lovable kid. You couldn't help but cheer for him. And I was with Peter B's, ""Do I want kids now?"" after spending time with Miles. 

I love how all the Spiders were so different from each other. Even the two Peters were different. One was a blonde, blue eyed Catholic. The other is brown eyed, brown haired and Jewish. I would have loved to see that dawn on Peter B. ""Wait, why is the other me buried in a Catholic cemetery next to a Catholic church? Wait, was I Catholic? ......meh, same amount of guilt either way."" 

I think this is my favorite version of Aunt May. She was so capable and smart compared to how she is usually portrayed as in the dark clueless. Loved her trying to kick everyone out so that they ruin her house in the fight.

I also loved the Dolphin call. It wouldn't be a Lord and Miller movie without it.  

This movie deserves a second and even third viewing just to catch all the things happening in the background. All the subtle differences between world like how in our world it's NYPD but in Miles' it's PDNY. I don't even want go into the character designs because that's a whole different post. But I love them as well. Especially Fisk's. Okay, a little thing, I do love how they made Mile's eyes look off colored in some parts. Like if he was in a comic book and the printer messed up a bit. Some parts of his iris was white. And the brown was sometimes outside the circle of his iris. That was clearly a choice and I thought it was neat. 

Shoot, this was a fun movie. ",a5yi33
ecbqeue,"I think we saw a 3D projection of the movie even though we got tickets to a regular showing and there were no 3D glasses.  A friend who was also there said he walked out about 20 minutes into it and got glasses from a bin in the lobby, and said it looked like actual 3D.  To me it looked very unfocused at times, like multiple images of a character slightly out of phase with each other if that makes sense.  Then I googled the movie, and it said that was intentional .

When there's so many of these superhero films coming out that absolutely struggle visually (think about how flat the cinematography has looked in a lot of the MCU), it's massively refreshing to see a film that is visually loaded, yet never feels like it's too much to look at. Sure, it is cheesy but the story takes a complicated idea and streamlines it to be enjoyable, without sacrificing character moments. Don't really rate films, but I'd say it's the best superhero film this year, and one of the best animated films this year, though maybe not as good as Isle of Dogs.",a5yi33

ebwfk5x,"A few issues:

1) Gwen’s whole plot backstory doesn’t make sense. She’s sent back a week before everyone else and somehow “sense” she has to be at the school so there’s a contrived reason to have her at the school. This was a week before Miles got his powers.

I also think they cut some parts out. There’s a one liner about how she understands what Jake Johnson’s Peter is going through when he sees MJ, maybe implying that she tried/deduced Chris Pine’s Peter is Spider-Man and tried interacting with him, but that’s never really addressed why she doesn’t go to him or Aunt May’s house right away.

Also shouldn’t she be glitching the week she was there? How long do characters have before they’re not allowed in another timeline? And if happens so randomly, how did Gwen pretend to be a student and be at school hours for so long and not get caught glitching?

2) How did Miles and Jake Johnson’s Peter elude the cops when they were injured by the sidewalk below the train? They had cops chasing them and seemed injured on the sidewalk. How did they not get captured by police?

3) More contrivances, but what was the overall plan of Peni, Porker, and Noir Parker? Why were they just chilling in the hideout before the plot arrives? They didn’t seem to have plans to know how to find the device that sent them home or get the intel needed to create the goober? 

4) Why include the scene where Mile’s dad thinks the new Spider-Man killed his brother if he doesn’t think that by the end of the movie? Moreover, why did he change his mind at all? He saw Miles fight the Kingpin but there was nothing that indicated that he didn’t kill the Prowler. ",a5yi33
ec0m972,Gwen Stacey waifu?,a5yi33
ec2dha5,"I wish we got more bigger-budget animated superhero movies, because they allow the filmmakers to do things that can't be done well in live action. I liked this a lot, but I'm not quite as high on it as many in this thread.

What I liked: Like I said, I thought it was cool that being animated allowed the movie to do some things that would look really bad in live action. For example, the way Kingpin was shaped or the way some of the villains moved. I'm a pretty casual Spider-Man fan, but I liked the twist this movie had on Dr. Octopus and Green Goblin. I mostly liked the animation style, with a few exceptions. I thought it was a good choice to kill off Peter Parker: it was both shocking and legitimately moving. The voice acting was uniformly pretty solid, I thought Brian Tyree Henry, Mahershala Ali, and Kathryn Hahn were the highlights. Henry especially was great in a role unlike any other I've seen from him. I really liked the recurring ""Spider origin story"" scene and wish we'd gotten full ones for the last three Spider-people. I liked the Gwen Stacy and Peter B Parker characters a lot. Finally, I thought the Stan Lee cameo and tribute was great, maybe the best one that's been done.

What I didn't like: I really wish we got more of Spider-Ham and Spider-Noir. I thought both Cage and Mulaney jumped off the screen whenever they spoke, but they just didn't get enough chances. I also wish we got a little more with Aaron/Prowler.  There were also a few instances where the animation just didn't look good for me.  One notable example is the first time Miles' powers go off at school and he's walking around on the side the building. I also thought Miles' character arc in the film was pretty much standard for an origin story. 

Off-topic story: I'm not sure why, but the previews that played before this got all the upcoming Christian movies, and none of the upcoming superhero movies. Kind of a weird choice.

Overall this is a 4/5 for me. It's my favorite animated film of the year, but I'm not quite as high on it as some others here. It's probably my number 3 superhero movie this year and my number 4ish Spider-Man movie. I'd still be there opening weekend for any sequel or spinoff of this.",a5yi33
ebr3ufl,"My Biggest Fear from this movie is that its so good, Sony will eventually run it into the ground. Theyre already trying to copyright the animation style.

 The first few sequels will be good. Personally i dont want another big as multiple spidermen crossover, just give me a lovestory between Miles and Gwen.
 But sony will probably do like 50 of these with every spiderperson eventually getting their own movie, and by the end well all be sick of spiderverse movies. I love Peter Porker but i can already see how some executive is thinking of making him their own version of the minions.

Other than that. This movie is so fucking good. Holy shit how did they make this movie so fucking good. Its like this generations Lion King or Toy Story.",a5yi33

ebtzezj,"""Spider (hyphen) man: Into the Spider (hyphen) verse"" is a fun popcorn flick with fantastical visuals that encapsulates the audience. The plot is about the initiation of new Spider-man, Miles Morales, into the grand Spider-man mythos. Like all Spider-men ~~and Spider-women and Spider-children~~, Miles utilizes the loss of a loved one to develop into the hero he needs to be. His story begins at the tail-end of his universe Spider-man's life. Thanks to an inter-dimensional portal, Miles can learn to be Spider-man through the best teachers he can get, other Spider-men. 

One thing this film does right is that it remains focused on Miles journey alone. There are a ton of characters and cameos here but the movie is all about how Miles interact with them. The two main support characters are Spider-man (Peter B. Parker) and schoolmate/will they won't they love interest/""friend"" Spider-Gwen. Peter B. becomes an unwilling mentor to Miles and his journey entails learning how to become a better man. Not much of Spider-Gwen's character is expanded upon, and this brings up an issue with the film. The side characters are more extended cameos than characters themselves, which is kind of disappointing but that was what the trailers accurately promised. Also, Kingpin's dilemma, although a foil for Miles' story, feels somewhat forced in.

The directing and cinematography are great. Also, the music compliments the movie tone really well. 

All in all, Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse will provide its audience with an exceptional experience this holiday season. Where the movie lacks in character development, it makes up for it with its visuals. See this at least twice, including once in 3D, at the theaters. 

**Notes**

* Stan Lee's cameo would have had a different tone if the man was alive today
* The shoulder touch
* That end credits scene was too good
* So much product placement and Chance
* Miles training for the final fight would be more believable if it was more than 5 hours
* Unlike ""A Dog's Way Home"", Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse's trailer did not give away the entire film",a5yi33
ecprqsw,"I thought this film was...fine. I really don't understand all the hype or the overblown reactions to it. The art style was interesting and I applaud them for doing something new in that department, but it didn't work for me all of the time. Most of the character designs were great, but the Green Goblin and Kingpin both looked awful, IMHO. I'm honestly shocked at how much love that Kingpin design has gotten. The story was pretty generic, run-of-the-mill comic book cartoon. The voice acting was all great. 

&#x200B;

Definitely a fun film, but after a week of seeing people hype it up and act like it was the best Spider-Man movie ever, or that it was even a contender for best film of the year, I felt a bit let down. It's good for a cartoon, but definitely doesn't hold a candle to most of the big live action films I've seen this year.",a5yi33

Hard to explain but around most edges, especially on characters  they had red or blue bleeding from the outline, almost looked like a old-school 3d movie without the glasses on.

Made my eyes struggle to focus a lot of the time.

Edit: I get that it was supposed to represent the multiverse or add to the comic style but it just felt like it was out of focus most of the time. When they really exaggerated the effect with clear blocky outlines of different colours it didn't bother me at all but the more subtle shimmer was really awful and detracted from the otherwise amazing looking film.",a5yi33

As a Spider-Man fan this film was fantastic. I grew up playing Spider-Man games like Shattered Dimensions and Edge of Time and seeing every single iteration of Spider-Man done justice was amazing. When I first heard about an animated Miles Morales Spider-Man film I wasn't sure, but everytime info like the cast(Shameik Moore, Brian Tyree Henry, Mahershala Ali) or writers(Lord and Miller) my confidence grew. I was worried they wouldn't do Miles justice, but this film was amazing. Everything from the fresh art style to the energetic soundtrack really gave the world a personality of its own. The Migeul O'Hara Spidey 2099 teaser was a nice nod to fans as well. I hope everyone is on board for a sequel because I'd love to see this world again!

Plus I mean, Mahershala Ali. You can’t go wrong with an actor of that caliber. Overall, I don’t really have anything negative to say.  It’s not like the best superhero movie of the year but it was fun and I think the Spiderverse can pump out a couple more interesting animated sequels. ",a5yi33

Her presence didn't accomplish anything, she didn't talk to Miles when she saw him climbing a wall outside the building, and for some reason we have to accept that she was the only spider-person who went backwards in time a week.

ebr3yvc,"Movies like this remind me even more why I dislike the MCU. Into the Spider-verse was a genuinely great movie and shows how much potential cbm movies have but instead we keep getting the same generic trash over and over again with the live action movies  

And finally after like 15 years we get a good Spider-Man movie no thanks to the Disney and the MCU. This is a movie that actually celebrates the character and what he stands for rather than just making him a fucking sidekick to Iron Man and not letting him stand on his own. Seriously we get 10 minutes of him in Civil War cracking jokes and being awkward and everyone gushes that he's the best on screen spider-man. Then we get movies where he's essentially relegated to Robin status. Spider-Man the biggest Marvel superhero. He does nothing of note in the mcu other than quip well and over act his nonsensical death scene. 

Sony gets a lot of shit on here from people who want to see Venom in the MCU but they've done well. Thank god Disney doesn't own every single Marvel character yet. And it's hilarious that Venom smashed Ant-Man and the Wasp in the box office. [Looks like the boycott didn't go too well huh?](https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckMarvel/comments/98ox37/boycottvenom/) Ant-Man and the Wasp was Ant-Man's third appearance in the MCU, coming off the back of Infinity War so there's really no excuse for it failing as hard as it did no matter how hard mcu fanboys try to excuse it. Looks like Disney ain't getting those rights back anytime soon, especially after a film as great as Spider-Verse 

Meanwhile Sony has two successful universes ready to go with the live action universe and the animated universe. I really can't wait to see how they grow the animated universe. 

I hope Into the Spider-verse gets nominated for an Oscar. It deserves to get one

ebroavt,"I really enjoyed the film but after my first viewing I don't think i'm as wowed by it as everyone else. I agree completely with the technical achievements of the visuals and the music but story wise it wasn't exactly what I expected and i'm not sure why. I feel like I need a second viewing to properly judge the film because there was a lot going on with a lot of substance that warrants a rewatch. Plus some elements were set up which I was then surprised were never followed through e.g. Gwen being apart of Miles' school which I thought meant we'd get some fun school interactions between the two of them but the school is abandoned pretty much after it's first scene. Going in knowing what to expect this time would hopefully lead to a better enjoyment of the narrative.

I think it is a credit to the screenwriters though that they could have so much going on with several Spider-Men and somehow keep it focused on Miles. The way each hero help him become Spider-Man is great and really lends itself well to the final message of the movie that anyone can be Spider-Man.",a5yi33

I'm not going to go into any spoilery details, but I just was listening to the most recent episode of Filmspotting and it sounded like they were saying that just because it's the main location in which the plot takes place, Miles' universe is *our* universe. I feel like either they weren't paying attention, or I deeply misunderstood the movie?

My interpretation was that Miles lives in a universe much like ours but with significant differences, like the Hollywood industry being in Inglewood instead, and pop culture references like alternate famous soda brands and posters like ""Chance 4.""

I thought that if *any* of the universes/dimensions shown were supposed to be ours (or nearly identical to ours) that it was supposed to be the one that old-not-young-and-not-blond ""Peter B. Parker"" came from. Even the universe that Gwen came from seemed to be signified as different from our own.

ec5ettn,"Saw the movie a few days ago. I'm not as gung ho about it as most people it seems but thought it was cool. I think your feelings towards the animation style is gonna make or break it for most people. 

I thought it was really choppy and distracting at times like characters were missing frames while moving. It reminds me of when I read comics and my eyes dart between the space between the panels called gutters. It's used to convey passage of time and movement for the static images. I'm not sure it worked for me here in a movie where action can take place real time though.

Speaking of comic influence, I used to hate Hulk (2003) use of panels! It looked so shitty but in Spider verse, worked really well when they used it sparingly. I think being an animated movie helped in that regard. 

I loved the thought bubbles, the ben day dots, captions, etc. Shit was like blending two mediums together! However, the color palette felt like someone took a Warhol Pop Art painting and just assaulted my eyes with them lol. During the big fight at the end, I kinda lost track of what I was even looking at lol. 

The themes of the movie were pretty obvious and beat in your head, especially with Miles' monologue at the end but the movie is PG and aimed towards families and kids, so that's fine I suppose.

Obligatory Sony product placements ( Xperia phone) and weirdly I am pretty sure I saw a product placement for the Chinese messaging app QQ as one of the apps on his phone. The animation style fit great mixing in Noir and Anime into it. Action was nice. Prowler was terrifying especially that screech noise every time he moved. Doc Ock was scary good too. Killer end credit too wonder how the sequels are gonna go. Was the role of Spider-Man kissing Mary Jane reversed in that iconic shot where Spider-Man was hanging upside down except in this one Mary Jane was or was I seeing things?



Minor Nitpicks: 

No one really questioned or getting punished after Miles Morales destroyed the security guard's office.

Is Miles Morales Spider-Man Gwen Stacey dead ? Also did Gwen Stacey have no problems with glitching in the one week she was pretending to be a student at the school and how was she able to get in? 

Miles roommate I felt was a bit underdeveloped but understandable for pacing. Just really weird to have someone know his secret identity and never talk once. We did get some characterization through the montage scene of him though.

Miles Morales broke some glass on the top of a skyscraper doing his leap of faith which looked cool as he was falling but I was worried it might hit someone below and this is why Spider-Man is a menace who is gonna pay to repair and replace that broken window now. Where is the Daily Bugle too. 

Wish we got the M.J. from the Miles Morale's spiderman universe a bit more closure but her speech was great. At least have her learn that alternate spidermans were here since Aunt May knew and was helping out. 

Poor Aunt May's house after asking for them to take it outside. I hope she had insurance cause her house got pretty trashed. 

They keep yelling out Miles name in front of the villains. 

How much food does Peter Parker need to eat in order to grow a stomach? I imagine his super powers and lifestyle help stave off the weight gain normal people would go through.

Anywho, fucking great movie!! Gonna go see it again and pay for 3D and make sure I have my fucking glasses! ",a5yi33
edlu9zh,"I watched this a few hours ago had a few problems with the movie that stuck out to me

The main thing I don't get is how Gwen found Miles. Somehow her spider sense took her to a school. Don't think that is how it works at all but okay. Then she somehow gets enrolled in the school despite it being expressly stated that a test needs to be taken to be accepted and this likely would have taken place months before the exam but fine whatever. But THEN they meet each other and she still can't tell he is Spiderman despite every other encounter showing that they can feel each others spider sense, and this can't be because Miles' is weak to begin with since Peter recognises it as soon as they meet when he has only just got the powers. The movie is clearly trying to have its cake and eat it too in terms of spidey sense but I will not stand for it.

Next is the development of the spider-people. While Gwen was really cool I felt like there was never a moment where she truly learned to trust Miles or really had a completed arc. Peter stopping Miles from staying back for him is very hypocritical but not necessarily that bad. I understand spider ham as being purely comedy relief but Penni Parker did nothing. I felt she was truly wasted and if she wasn't there the story would not have changed in any way. IMO they may have taken a little too long to introduce these characters which stopped them from being able to grow from their experience, all it needed to be really was something like trusting others or like realising you aren't alone.


I don't see why Peter would be the only Spider-man who has any doubts about their lives or has any growing to do as a Spider-person or that benefits from his experiences in the movie in a manner that can impact his actual life, while Gwen simply gets the idea that there are others but this isn't something that will alter her behaviour in any way, maybe if she had been more reluctant or felt like she had to do way too much or something it could have been comforting for her to know there are other people like her.

Lastly Miles is way too OP. I mean seriously being able to go invisible is a very helpful thing that sets him apart from the others but the electricity thing on top puts on a completely different playing field to the others in terms of his potential. I mean he may have been on the brink of losing but realistically while Kingpin should represent a huge threat, I feel like with about one month of training he will be able to beat kingpin with ease. 

Obviously the theme of the movie was about anyone being able to be a hero but Miles just kinda seemed able to control his powers. I remember earlier in the movie Peter tells him that the best way to stop sticking to things would be to just relax and feel comfortable yet when he starts to control his electricity it comes from a burst of emotion. Clearly the movie ran out of time for Miles to actually get any real training to be Spider-man that would have made the movie more realistic or make his success feel more earned but I feel as though if him being able to control his emotions and relax had been the key it would have been a better way to show personal growth as integral to the growth of his powers.

Anyway, if I had to give a rating out of ten to this movie I would probably give it a 8.5-9/10. I absolutely loved the movie and I am really glad that sony did it. Nice to see Spider 2099 at the end and honestly the first 20 minutes or so of the movie were so enthralling to me I couldn't stop watching. It was a great experience and I'm glad I watched the movie.

The new art style is exactly that.....art. which, by definition, is subjective. It just didn't work for me. The visuals were not bad at all, but i prefer Brad Bird's style of fluid action sequences.

The low framerate was fucking annoying.

The story was.......good. Quite standard, nothing pathbreaking. Voice acting from Jake Johnson was excellent, but the others were just ok. There was never really a sense of menace from either of the two main villains, Patrick Wilson's oceanmaster felt far more badass.

A solid 7/10

ebvv1aq,"9/10 solid movie. Probably better than Homecoming overall, even though I liked that too.

But I have a few gripes with Into the Spiderverse.

First, Kingpin should have been more developed, and while not necessarily  more sympathetic, just more fleshed out than just the pen flashback. Only people who watched Daredevil or read the comics only really know about Kingpin going in. Remember, the general marvel movie only watching audience who don't know about Kingpin are just knowing about him for the first time. After all, he killed Mile's idol Spider Man and his second unofficial parental figure uncle Davis too. How much his family meant to him. Maybe, we should have had a glimpse into Kingpin's violent nature? Maybe, establish more animosity between both Miles and Kingpin than there is? Like how the spider suit reminds Kingpin of his family's death? Idk.

In addition, maybe I feel that this movie would have benefitted from  a ""hunting down Uncle ben (or in this case Davis) murderer"" scene like in the past spider man movies or a Big Hero six hiro fucks up callahan scene. After Prowler's death, maybe Miles tries to kill Kingpin in secret in his house or something when Kingpin is looking at pictures of his. Two ways this can play out. Emotionally grieving Miles beating the shit out of Kingpin or Miles has the upper hand at first and then Kingpin nearly kills him. Then at the last second, with spidey sense, the spider gang saves him and then a big group scene happens when they tell Miles it might be overwhelming to deal with all the death, being near death and he's not alone. It would have a greater emotional impact.

I also felt that at the conclusion fight at the Collider, the events should have played out where Miles beats Kingpin until his weakened. Next scene might parallel the beginning where Kingpin kills a helpless Spidey after the destruction of the collider. But instead of Miles taking the opportunity to kill Kingpin in his weakened state, Miles says ""no"" and just takes him in to the cops by leaving him helpless on a spider web.

Might be dark for a PG movie, but seeing what they got away with in this movie, they could have done more with Kingpin.

I might be rambling, but they could have played with Spiderman sense of duty and not killing. While both villains and heroes have lost loved ones, their morality to do the right thing separates the both of them.",a5yi33

edlh4a1,"I saw it yesterday, and I'm not as satisfied as I expected to be. Don't get me wrong, the movie is *good*, funny, and contrary to lots of superhero movies there aren't many unearned, overly sentimental moments, which is something I usually find really cringe-inducing. [(The thing with Uncle Aaron was a bit easy, but it's linked with Miles' relationship with his father and several other things, so it doesn't feel that cheap.)](#spoiler)

That being said, I can't say I was *really* impressed by anything. Everything is good, everything works, but nothing is truly great - except the gorgeous artstyle, but even then, the pacing and the cuts are so quick, the shots don't really have the time to breathe IMO. It could be because I usually prefer slower movies, but it's not like I only watch *auteur* films. 

I guess I have the same problem with the story : there are really exciting elements that aren't given the time to really shine. Spider-Gwen doesn't really feel like a complete character to me, and Peter B. Parker, while more interesting, is a missed opportunity. Wouldn't it be more interesting if we had more time to learn about him, his life, and his feelings about it, especially since [he basically tries to commit suicide at the end of the movie - even after Miles revealed his powers, which meant he no longer had to sacrifice himself anymore. WTF ? I thought he was just a bit depressed, not full-blown suicidal ?](#spoiler). And were Spider-Ham and the Japanese Spider-girl necessary ? (Granted, they remain quite discreet, I feared worse.)

Everything about this movie is great, the art style is great, the soundtrack is great, the plot is great, EVERYTHING! This movie is actually even an animated version of my older brother! (You know, listening to ghetto music and stuff...) Now I can just sit down and wait until they make a movie that's an accurate representation of me. Here are my favorite parts of the movie:

* The entire movie, no joke. The ENTIRE movie!
* The ending battle too, It's well written and animated!
* The after-credits scene. Yeah, been a great year for after-credit scenes, huh? Where we have >!2099!Spider-Man/Miguel O'Hara!< (or ""Interesting Person #1"") >!going all the way back to 1967,!< which leads us to >!the ""Spider-Man meets Spider-Man"" meme!< we all know and love, complete with >!a mad Miguel!< complaining about why >!60's!Spider-Man is pointing at him.!<
* The cameo from >!STAN LEE!< AS A COSTUME STORE OWNER.
* AND >!HIS DEDICATION IN THE END CREDITS.!<
* I also liked Mile's thoughts, It's a nice little touch to the movie.

THOUGHTS ON THE TRAILERS BEFORE:

* Artemis Fowl: Oh man, another Harry Potter-esque movie?
* How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World: Again, I can't wait to see it.

Wow, that's a pretty disappointing amount of trailers.

However there were some things I didn't quite understand. [How was Gwen already there in Miles's universe before he witnesses the particle accelerator being used? Was it something I missed? 

Who was in the after-credits exactly? I remember it being another spiderman and some woman talking to him.

One thing I wasn't quite a fan of was that certain things in the film felt rushed, particularly character It may just be me, but I didn't get  the ""friendship"" between Miles and Gwen. I didn't even really believe they had formed any sort of connection. There was just the two scenes of him and Gwen in school, the scene where they talked on the bus and that was it I think? I didn't really like the scene where Miles is encouraged by his Dad and then he just figures out his powers and is fight ready. I know that hobo spiderman gave him the talk of how one never knows when they will be ready and it will just come eventually, but it felt a bit underwhelming nonetheless for Miles to so quickly become the badass he needs to be.

The characters are just as colorful as the animation with standout performance from Chris Pine and Nicolas Cage is hilarious and steals every frame. I also liked what they did with the Kingpin character. Btw it has to be the best post-credit scene  I´ve seen. Will definitely be an honorable mention on my end of the year top 10. Hopefully it wins best animated picture.

However like many superhero films IMO its biggest flaw is the balance between drama and humor. Its really hit and miss. To  many times it undercut emotional and suspenseful moments with jokes that didn´t need to be there. While other times you could hear a pin drop  in theater after a joke. Another problem was that it retreaded some  grounds that old Spider-Man movies already gone through. Like falling  down building trying out his powers, the vocie over speech and see his  face in a Spider-Man mask when he has to prove himself. Not only that  but in this one it was so unnecessary because the speech was like 1 minute prior to that moment and then you have to hear it again. To me it was jarring.

He was a hired gun for Kingpin and was about to kill a teenage boy if he hadn't realised it was his nephew. I also felt like  there was no real point in showing the Alleyway scene between Miles and his father since it implied that he blamed spider man for his brother's death and that misunderstanding was simply solved by just seeing spider man fight kingpin.

Saw it today - I don't really get the hype. The whole balance of the movie between comedy and drama felt off. It felt like one of those movies that tried too hard to be both but achieved neither. The twist of the uncle being the villain would have been a hard hitting, emotional moment had the whole movie not been comedy up until that point. Then there was a moment where Parker sees his wife from another dimension and delivers a emotional, dramatic speech that would have been very touching... had he not decided to relegate the scene into a comedy mid speech. 

I didn't really find much of the jokes very funny either. The movie got gradually worse as time went on for me. I wish movies would just commit to either action or comedy, or have a little bit of one instead of trying to be both. One of the many reasons why 99.999999% of Bollywood movies are complete garbage.

My problem with her is that she's seemingly nothing like the Gwen from her own comic series. We get the brief scene of her as a drummer, yet they chose not to even say which band she's in? (She plays in Mary's Jane's rock band.) They apparently reveal she's taken ballet and her discipline and fighting style come from that, but that's unique to the movie; her fighting style is more... street-smart, untrained, undisciplined, not the graceful and stylish way we see.

She also wears Chucks/sneakers, not ballet flats. She also doesn't have the crooked front teeth. Her attitude is more emo/depressed than the upbeat, lovey-dovey (""Sitting in a Tree"") personality we see.

My criticism of her portrayal isn't really fair, since they need to obviously make changes to fit the narrative, but I just find it disappointing how they made her.

It's the type of thing Ang Lee tried to do with his Incredible Hulk. It didn't work then, and I don't think it worked now. It definitely won't work for sequels, especially the visual sound effects. For a while, I thought they'd pay off in the story but they didn't. As for the story, I think it has decent ideas but the ""reveal"" (I've read some of Miles' comics but I hadn't read anything about his uncle or the Prowler), which I think was supposed to be a surprise for those who hadn't read the comics, was telegraphed and anticlimactic. A lot of the film had backgrounds that looked like it was supposed to be 3D. Apparently they did that so the audience wouldn't focus on the background. If you gotta get that gimmicky to focus attention, you don't understand visuals. 

Anyway, I did like the film, but I wanted to bring up these issues because it isn't a perfect film. There are a lot of issues with it and if we get another like it, I think it'll flop because what people seem to like is mostly a lot of flash. The substance is kind of thin for a movie aimed at anyone over 12.

Edit: and oh yeah, they made Aunt May a ridiculous plot convenience, not a character.

Edit 2: Also, MJ obviously would have known who Wilson Fisk was. She knew Peter was Spider-Man and Aunt May mentioned that Peter was Spider-Man to stop the Kingpin. It'd be pretty weird for him not to tell that to MJ. Why would she go to a party Fisk is throwing for her husband and not think it's in incredibly bad taste for there to be waiters dressed up as her husband who died just days earlier?

I got used to it, mostly, after about 10 minutes. Still felt like the frame rate was all over the place and that they had somehow stuck a 3d version on instead. I really don't know what they were going for, unless theatres have a deal to bundle aspirin with popcorn now.

Nothing redeemable about anything in here. I could have sworn this was made by one of those direct to video animation companies that rip off Disney.

1/10. I recommend you go see Aquaman instead. ",a5yi33
ebqvnww,"I haven't seen this movie nor do I plan to in the theater, but tell me if I'm wrong that the SJW praise is in full effect because of the black/Hispanic ""Spider-man"" and female Gwen superhero.  Black Spidey currently has a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes just like every other movie whose central character is black.  The white guilt by movie critics is just at peak levels now when all people want to see is an honest opinion of whether they should waste their $15 and 2 hours or not.

Anyway, I did watch the trailers because of all the hype, and this movie seems to be like any other animated DC or Marvel superhero *cartoon movie* except it's an urban superhero who could be right out of The Boondocks series.  ",a5yi33

ebr3433,"I have to say this was the best spiderman movie to come out since spiderman 2.  It had everything a spiderman geek would want and created a better compelling Miles Morales.  I loved 99% of the movie and laughed harder than any movie to come out in years.  My only complaint is the final fight.  It built up so well till until the other spiders went back to their dimension.  It slowed down the pace so much and the tone changed so much, I felt like it was written by another person for another character.  It was like a great sneeze was about to come out but then someone comes along and rubs your nose and the sneeze goes away.  The cliched ""you can do it Miles"" moment was just too weak of an attempt to create conflict in the final minutes.  This is how I think the final fight should have gone.

All the spiders enter the warp core except Peter as done in the film.  As Peter falls to the core, he shouts, ""Go get him tiger!""  This motivates Miles to bring out his full potential to confront King Pin.  Miles charges up his lightning and faces the King Pin.  An intense fight ensues like in the film and the King Pin gets in some good hits.  Miles falls to the ground and is dazed.  Miles' father sees this and shouts, ""Spiderman!  You can do this!  Give him everything you got!  Everything!""  This gives Miles the final surge he needs and he leaps high up into the air as the King Pin is about to put the final hit on him.  Miles shoots out a hundred webs throughout the whole dome, attaching against the walls and other debris, including the atom collider.  As he hangs there, he builds up his lightning charge.  With his final strength, he pulls all the attached structures toward him and the lightning shoots out to all the webs, helping to detach the structures.  The debris comes crashing down and into the core.  The King Pin falls from his spot and into the core with the rest of the debris.  End scene.

Mid Credits:  The King Pin wakes up in darkness.  He is in the midst of all the debris that had fallen into the core with him.  He hears muffled shouting and then the large slab of concrete on top of him is removed.  On top of him is Spiderman.  The King Pin shouts in pain, ""Spiderman!""  Spiderman stands there for a second, reaches down and says, ""Dad?""  The King Pin looks confused.  Spiderman takes off his mask.  It's King Pin's son.  ""Dad, you're alive.  How?""  The King Pin looks confused but at the same time he starts to tear up as he sees his son for the first time in years and the look of caring in his son's eyes lets him know this son still loves him.  The end.",a5yi33
ebs7qu3,"It was alright.

",a5yi33
ebtwdps,"A mediocre film that will be a 11/10 and A++ for hardcore fans of the character that are just in it for the references/easter eggs.  **It's basically LEGO Batman but Spider-Man this time**...go in expecting that and you'll have fun.

The bold new animation style was mostly excellent, but suffered during action scenes where it became too choppy and disorientating.  The music was very good.

Biggest problem with the film is that the supporting and cameo characters are a lot more interesting than the main character.  Miles is likable, yes, but bland.  And **his arc is *very* familiar, feeling like the fourth Spider-Man reboot since 2000.  You may end up wishing more time was spent with Gwen, Spider-Pig, Noir, Peni etc. all of whom feel fresh and like they have something new to say about Spider-Man**.  Miles has his quirks but ultimately is way too similar to Peter Parker to be as interesting, *especially* when he's retreading the origin story *again*.

The villains have excellent presentation, with Kingpin, Green Goblin, Doc Ock and The Prowler all feeling larger than life.  But, again, it highlights how Miles is lacking in comparison.

One quibble I have is how two alternate versions of Peter Parker are handled.  The first one we meet, who is blonde, is such a good fit for Ben Reilly that I'm genuinely confused as to why he wasn't him...but that's a nitpick.  The second, older Peter was the real problem.  No, sorry, I don't believe he'd be afraid to have kids or whatever, to the point that he and Mary Jane would have a divorce.  I know this is a path the comics have taken the character before, but it's bad writing and demonstrates poor understanding of the character at his core.

I call that a quibble, though, because the story isn't really about either of those characters.  It's about Miles.

There's **a post-credits scene that teases Miguel O'Hara, aka Spider-Man 2099.  Again it's a character that, in just a few seconds and lines of dialogue, manages to feel like he has a lot more to offer than Miles**.  A missed opportunity maybe, but the movie is definitely okay.

eczn32r,"I am well beyond the target age for this movie, which I think would be early to mid teens. It had a fun premise and some tasty humor, great animation and the story moved along (except the fights kinda dragged on and on and on). Problem is, the movie is full of treacle: sticky-sweet lessons about family and persistence and making good choices that were REPEATEDLY sledge-hammered into the story.

Leaving the theater, I felt that I had watched two hours of the Cartoon Network's less inspired offerings, with commercials. (The theater's pre-movie selection was nothing but commercials.

If you are an adult, I hereby warn you that you will not like this movie.

There is only one Spiderman. Not ""everyone can be Sipderman"" like the stupid message of this movie is trying to push. Peter learned the lesson of needing to take responsibility for his actions and uses that to become a hero. Not everyone can or is capable of learning this lesson. If that was possible there would be no crime.

I hate the stupid pig and the anime Spidergirl with the robot. What in the fuck? If they were going to do the stupid ass ""multiple Spiderman"" thing they should have all been Peter Parkers.

Pixar which always has a high chance of winning released the highest grossing animated feature of all time this year to rave reviews. Sure Incredibles 2 might be a let down compared to the first one (I happen to think so), but loads of people loved it and it made \*bank\* which means apathetic voters might vote for it.   


Also released this year was Isle of Dogs which is strong competition for the award.

If Spider-Verse were released in the beginning of the year, I would have said that not even a nomination is a lock. Now a nomination is happening (if in part by the weak year in mainstream animation, but The Lego Batman Movie lost out on a nominations against Boss Baby and Ferdinand soo), but I still struggle to see a win.

Because they had 5 other characters to do the heavy lifting for most of the movie, when Miles finally gets his chance to be the Hero, it feels like he as well as the audience has earned it and it's both an acknowledgement of his arc as his own individual Spider-Man as well as him taking his friends' well-being into his own hands.

Willpower can do a lot, but it doesn't instantaneously make you a pro Spider-Man when you could barely swing the day before.",a5yi33
ech84oi,"I think it's because Miles had to earn it. He didn't just happen to make an awesome suit on his own like most superheroes do. On top of that, we saw a callback to his creativity, using the tagging style to express his unique identity on the outfit itself, thus exposing a side of himself that he likes showing off with stickers and graffiti. It's visual storytelling at its finest, and damn is it well done.",a5yi33
ebqstry,"Makes it even better that miles was actually training and making improvements throughout the movie so it wasn't like he just suddenly got good at parkour because of determination.

I think that’s a big part of why I love superheroes so much. They unite diverse groups of people and motivate them to be a little more selfless and push themselves a little harder. The ending of the movie was so perfect, anyone could wear the mask.

Besides, Tombstone is *supposed* to be an enforcer. That's all he is in the comics.

And if they change some of the villain statuses from the comics and make it work in the film itself, I'm cool with that. A well told story is better than having stuff be 100 percent comic accurate.

I thought this movie *obliterated* Homecoming. It was everything I never got from that movie.

Don't get me wrong, I *liked* Homecoming, but I never bought that *that* Peter really stood for anything. Being an Avenger?

And then they made the character dumber in Infinity War. No way in heck would I believe that Peter would hang onto a spaceship without knowing what's really at stake. 

Then the writers *chicken out* the reveal to Aunt May by not bringing it up in Infinity War. Worst off, they'll probably turn it into a gag.

Sorry, but imo Homecoming isn't my Spider-Man. But THIS movie? Loads of heart and the stakes feel real.

Yes. The *stakes* feel real.

Tony getting stabbed? Nah, it's okay.

Gamora dying? Nah, she'll be back.

The sequel characters getting erased? Nah they'll be back in their own solo movies.

its a pretty confusing topic because the potential is so high, yet the average doesnt feel like average but non existent.

There's enough dialogue given to imply why Uncle Aaron chose his lifestyle. Jefferson clearly doesnt like Miles hanging with Aaron and the dialogue implies that he knows his brother is a criminal.

There's a reason Miles' father forces him to take the private school seriously. It's a ticket away from turning into someone like Aaron, who he idolizes.

Brilliant movie. ",a5yi33
ebv40st,"Most likely less studio meddling and more creative control from a phenomenal director. A lot of Sony’s previous Spidey misfires happened because the studio execs had mandates for things that got shoved into the films. Venom was added to Spiderman 3 even though he’s a 90s style villain out of place with the 60s atmosphere of the Raimi filma. TASM 2 had the same issue with an over abundance of villains and convoluted plotlines since they wanted to jumpstart a Sinister Six series of movies.


Into The Spider-Verse could have ended up as a poor movie. It has more heroes and villains, as well as a lot of content. However, what really sets the movies apart in quality is the script and direction. All of the heroes and villains are focused on one thing, the super collider. The story is largely about Miles’ character development and growth. Everything in the film comes down to Miles becoming Spider-Man. 


This strong focus on character growth with one overarching goal gives the film a strong direction with a satisfying conclusion. If you look at the other Spidey films, they’re really all over the place. They try to do a lot of things half baked. There’s a ton of storylines going on that have absolutely nothing to do with each other. Sandman, Venom, and Harry don’t interact with each other til the end of the film. That movie juggles storylines very poorly. The TASM series deals with Oscorp, Peter’s parents, and the villains and none of those themes get adequate development.

As for the joke scene, yeah, I would've liked at least a bit of a stinger at the end of that where she looks back at him and has an expression of confusion or suspicion about him. Though I'm not sure what more they could've really done there. It'd be strange/unsettling for her to talk to the guy whose basically in love with her (due to her counterpart, I mean) when her Peter just died.

The moment Peter did the dance from Spider Man 3 and they even played the same song, I was dying. I loved every single thing about this movie. 

It's hard for me to dethrone what I believe the greatest superhero movie of all time (Spider Man 2) but it just might be. This blew away every single superhero movie I have ever seen.

The animation was just wow, I've never seen anything like it. Miles was such an incredible Spider-Man and I loved how they built it up. ",a5yi33
ebsy34v,The fact it was the first cameo since his death AND he was talking about missing one of his most beloved characters after their death nearly put me in tears.,a5yi33

God, that moment when [Peter has to go see Aunt May, and his voice cracks just a little bit when he sees her, even knowing it's not HIS universe's Aunt May](#spoiler) literally broke me.

Since Spider-Man 2099 (during the post credits scene) did figure out a way to hop through different dimensions, wouldn't be a stretch to say that Gwen figured out a way to get to Miles' dimension.

Basically, after hearing you, I think this is kind of intentional blur that looks a lot like 3d fringing.

I don't think it kills the movie at all.  The art style is DEFINITELY the high point of the movie.  This is an amazing, trippy movie that includes a lot of variety which makes it feel like a *hyperkinetic graphic novel.*

The story is fine, but nothing mind blowing.  Really the art and getting the basics spot on, including a lot of fan service are great here.

I am in agreement with your score.",a5yi33

Neither is *explicitly* the *exact same guy* as Raimi-Spiderman - there's not continuity between these franchises.

The Spiderman comics in ITSV don't make reference to Peter Parker, the man behind the mask was named ""Billy"" in one of the shown panels. Given that Miles' Spiderman has a Christmas album and is a minor celebrity, he probably disclosed some part of his origin story for it to be written.",a5yi33

So it's possible he didn't even tell MJ out of fear Kingpin would get to her.

Miles didn't look like he had it that bad, and I was confused which was the primary theme of the film. Was it ""faith"" or ""great expectations""?

She’s forced to beat him in his Lizard form and he dies in the process; he reverts back to Peter as he dies in her arms, saying “I just wanted to be like you...”

Oh, and all of that takes place in just a few pages in her first issue.

His death hangs over the rest of her series. Gwen is incredibly depressed, and her dad Captain Stacy and the other cops think she killed Peter. She even, at one point, visits Aunt May and Uncle Ben, who still feel the pain of their nephew’s death, but welcome her with open arms.

I think it's pretty reasonable that he wouldn't notice the spidey sense going off with all of that going on.

There were other scenes too. I kept going back and forth as to whether they had the wrong print.

The collider created a gateway through space *and* time, which is why it was able to pull people not only from a different universe but from different  time-periods; hence Noir from the 30's(?) and Penni from the future.

""Spider-Man Unlimited"" video game, 2 4-parter ""Spider-Verse"" storylines in the USM cartoon and this movie are all based directly on it.

The sheer beauty of this concept is that you can play it over and over in different media, with different premise, different villains and a different set of Spider-People for a whole new experience.

Just for safety and avoiding a stupid controversy, they just didn't mention it.

\-Gwen isn't reacting to Peter either, even though in-movie it is confirmed Peter was her best friend and she was forced to put him down. Likely in order to save a lot of filler screentime of Peter and Gwen recognizing each other and sorting things out, they just omitted this to focus on the main story.",a5yi33

It reminds me of people thinking that Aunt May knew in Spider-Man 2 that Peter was Spider-Man. I've always resisted that notion. Just because she made a grand epic speech about being a hero doesnt mean that she knew her nephew had the abillity to leap tall buildings in a single bound.

Second time was super crisp and great, 3rd time felt like a 3d movie without glasses and I went out to complain. It ended up being a focusing problem by the projector that the person in charge fixed and the movie became much crisper. 


Tbh the movie works much better in 3d. The focus difference looks much better. The way the unfocus works in the film is that it looks like old comic prints with chromatic abberation which I found a tad distracting in the 2d version.

ednl28y,"When Gwen met Miles she did know he was a spider-man.  Search ""Gwen gets SPIDER-SENSE"" in [this](http://origin-flash.sonypictures.com/ist/awards_screenplays/SV_screenplay.pdf). 

I would agree that Peni and Noir aren't really fleshed out characters and are not utilized very much. I would disagree that this means they're wasted. 

I would say Gwen also has an arc, it just isn't emphasized. Gwen's arc is that of learnign that it's ok to have friends. After she killed her universe's Peter/her best friend she pretty much swore off friends. Through interactions with Miles and the rest of the Spider-Gang, she learns that it's ok to get close to people and even to rely on them sometimes, as demonstrated by the credits scene where she asks Miles for help. Ultimately, the main character is Miles, with a strong supporting character of Peter B., a secondary supporting character of Gwen, and a couple of side characters. Not all side characters can be fully developd in any movie.

Peter B. has the most personal growth to do because he was going through a midlife crisis. I think Gwen's behaviour towards other people will be altered in her own universe, personally.

Strictly speaking, it's camouflage, not invisibility. People can see him if they look hard enough. It's still a very useful ability, though. The venom blasts are also extremely useful, true. If it makes you feel better, Miles in the comics has these powers too and is potentially weaker than other Spider-Men in other ways. For example, they have spider-sense but that doesn't mean their spider-sense is equally effective. They have super strength but that doesn't mean they're equally strong. They're smart but that doesn't mean they're equally smart. Miles is portrayed to be a reasonably smart kid, but Peter Park is literally a super genius. 

Kingpin isn't supposed to be a particularly difficult foe to defeat physically. Sure, he's tougher than random street thugs, but he's not as tough as the rhino, venom, carnage, sandman, scorpio, etc. Kingpin's difficulty as a foe is traditionally in his ability to manipulate people, set up devious schemes, and use his extraordinary wealth to get what he wants. 

On to the emotion/calm aspect. I think it makes more sense the way they did it. Miles needs to calm down to *de*activate a power, that is, to stop sticking to stuff. This is probably true for the invisibility too. The invisibility activates when he gets scared and goes away when he calms down. The venom blast happens when he gets angry or similar. Emotions up, powers up. Emotions down, powers down. Controlling your emotions doesn't just mean being able to become calm on command. It means being able to have any emotion on command. Since Peter B. doesn't have invisibility or venom blasts, it's not like he could teach Miles how to use them anyway. ",a5yi33

They actually change quite a bit for the movie. Doc Ock was never a female in the books. (As far as I know). 

They skipped over Gwen being a huge part in Peter's life. (Which worked in this context)

They dont show Jameson or try to squeeze anything more than what's necessary to tell the story.

As a fan, they changed enough for it to be flat out weird, yet it worked tremendously. 

If you want *bad* fan service, check out X-Men The Last Stand or Spider-Man 3. 

Bad fan-service is when characters are shoved into a story and they add nothing to it. Venom is a big example of this. 

Good fan service is when the nods are present but work in the context of the film. Seeing the *Spider-Mobile* in the Spider-Man lair was a hilarious surprise. It's quick and doesnt detract from the story.

The Noir Spider-Man, Spider-Pig, and Peni Parker add comic relief and some gravitas to the story.

Venom from Spider-Man 3 was shoehorned in a poorly written script that couldnt contain him.

If anything, the movie was giving us proof that Peter Parker's Spider-Man isn't going anywhere, even when room is made for new and diverse characters.

There's a reason why this movie has had acclaim from both casuals and the most hardcore fans. Miguel O'hara (a Latino-Irish guy) will always be Spider-Man 2099, Miles Morales (an African-Hispanic kid) will always be Ultimate Spider-Man, and Peter Parker will always be the Amazing Spider-Man. This movie proves it.",a5yi33

It just clicked! Scott Pilgrim is my favorite movie of all time. Spider-Verse is competing **HARD.** And it clicks! The heart and soul of the source material being interwoven into the movie seamlessly, feeling like you’re watching a comic, a story unfold, both of them do that! ",a5yi33

They just use the multiverse excuse to have these little callbacks that make us feel good inside - and I, for one, appreciate it!",a5yi33
ebtxbkt,"My girlfriend and I have this theory that Chris Pine's Spider-Man is THE Spider-Man. He's the perfect version of them all. He has all of the best attributes of all the Spider-Men in the multiverse(i.e. the best aunt may, the best banter, he has all the coolest spider-man stuff in what is essentially his Spider-Cave, the most heroic, etc).

ec6hf1a,"I think OG Peter is a sort of representation of the general public perception of Spider-Man: successful, well-liked superhero with a ton of promotional tie-ins. Hence why he also gets shots from the movies, as that's  where most people would know him.

Whereas Peter B. Parker is a bit of a more cynical-if-realistic likely future for the character as fans of the character know him: living not just with too many years of being a superhero, but also years of Parker-luck and Peter's fear of opening up to folks and committing.",a5yi33

Although Miles' Peter also had the Christmas album, so I could've interpreted incorrectly. Also possible that both Peter's had the same past, and that old Peter was just different beyond Blonde Peter's death. ",a5yi33
ecn4a9z,"The Peter that we see in the movie that’s not from Mile’s universe is the one from our universe, or 616 or the regular Spider-Man. The Peter that dies is just the one in Mile’s universe.

ebtqkwd,dude was blonde tho...,a5yi33
ebypsu7,Yeah he seems to be a bit different than the Tobey peter if anyone actually is the Tobey Peter it's Jake Johnson. Him punching the car and his Alfred like Aunt May are definitely not Peter Parker from Raimi trilogy. ,a5yi33

They took advantage of the medium in a way that nothing else that I've seen has done, and blending surreal comic-book physics with visceral impacts and incredible weight in the animations made every swing and jump elicit a gut reaction. It was incredible.",a5yi33
ecuxa0y,"From the screenplay:

> Miles walks to the edge of the roof, the wind buffeting... and LEAPS! The camera is UPSIDE DOWN. Miles isn't falling through frame. He's RISING.

There is so much filmmaking heart in this movie. You'd think that a movie with multiple directors, multiple screenwriters, and 150 animators would lose a bit of that, as if it were a manufactured product, but instead it feels like each of the hundreds of people who played a part in the movie's production left a piece of them with it.",a5yi33

I don't know why, but it does.

I watched this movie in its entirety and didn't once feel like it did that. You had strong women characters (old and young), Characters of all races (and species), and each was fantastic in its own way. At the end I really understood for the first time how important it was for young latino kids to see someone like Miles on the big screen. And it was handled in a way I've never seen before, letting the characters stand on their own, and even though each only had a handful of lines, it just...worked. 10/10 film and WAY better than anything I've seen in years.

Also, people may see this as a shameless cash-grab. ""An animated Spider-Man movie with multiple Spider people?"" Yawn.

Black filmgoers may be insulted that Miles is only given a cartoon to shine when a lot of them may feel he deserved the live-action treatment. (I'm black, so I can speak from a black perspective)

Aquaman is near the corner along with Bumblebee, which may take the action filmgoers.

For the years and amount of phenomenal effort they gave to every single atom of production, why couldn't they have made the anime Spider-person more... anime?

I do understand that my grievance is misplaced because Peni looks just like she did in the comic books, but still.  I mean, c'mon.

Meaning the comic depiction needed to be taken much further in order to work in this art direction. 

His narrative would not've been as interesting had he not have been pushed to that graphic extreme stylization of his silhouette. By pushing that to 100 they were able to maximize the emotional impact of his narrative. where as say in the comics, he's by no means tame but he has some semblance of human scale. But the design choice to treat him as a caricature of himself worked super well imo. It was absurd and hilarious, I know for a fact those designers laughed their asses off working on the shape of him.

Another inspiration that comes to mind is Boy and The World, especially in terms of the low poly character design work, and the paint bursts of the climactic fight. Speaking of, the climactic battle in Summer Wars is a remarkable early example of what they were going for here. 

This is of course just talking about the animated inspirations as the Comic and Pop Art influences should be self-evident.

* This film was visually spectacular. I'm not usually one to go nuts over art or animation, but the animators of this film hit the ball out of the part with their comic style, the blending of different styles for different universes, and the glimpse of Gwen's world was gorgeous.
* Miles has (IMO) a more complex and interesting backstory. He didn't just lose his uncle, Miles feels guilty for not helping Parker, then found out the harsh reality that his uncle was not the man he thought he was, and watches his uncle die for sparing his life. The dynamics with his father were incredible.
* Doctor Octopus in this rendition was much more interesting and powerful (plus a woman!) and the Prowler is a long-overdue villain.
* The humor (especially the meta-humor such as the Spider-Man 3 reference) was great.
* The art and music were non-traditional for comic book movies, but worked really well and just goes to show that diversity is a great way to vary the tones/feel of comic book movies to avoid fatigue.
* I'm biased af because I absolutely love Ghost Spider/Spider-Gwen and her universe.

My only complaint (and its a small one) is how ridiculously large Kingpin was. Like he didn't have to be a 12-foot tall square, it was definitely a bit much. His motivation behind the collider was cool though.

That said I cannot praise Homecoming enough for its successful portrayal and perfect casting of the Vulture. The biggest problem with Holland's Spider-Man is the lack of his emotional motivation. He just wants to help and be a fun boy scout because 'something something power something something responsibility...' It just isn't as compelling when he doesn't have a back-story.",a5yi33

ecfciva,"Sorry not sure why you got downvoted for just asking a question. I didn't loathe it, I was just very unimpressed with it. It was like the opposite of this movie, everything that's wrong with the trend of superhero movies lately. I'll just copy and paste my ""review"" comment from that thread if you care to read it. I'm not a DC hater either, I wanted it to be good. I really like Momoa and the cinematography was great. It was just disappointing to me

_________________________________________________________

The cinematic definition of ""all flash, no substance."" It plays out like a videogame, a myriad of quests piling up on top of one another, one boss to conquer after the other. All the while littered with cliches, tropes, and cheesy, eye-rolling dialogue. 

It's saturated stylishness does help paint the idea of epic grandiose, however surface level it feels. The visuals do help make it the strongest entry of the DC universe imo, but I'm not sure that's saying much. Momoa tries his best to carry a poor script here, he has the charisma to pull off the role but unfortunately the writers do not.

Granted, at the end of the day I am not the target demographic for this movie. It's a superhero movie made to attract kids. It wasn't awful, it just doesn't try to do anything new, and it being so beautiful and stylishly shot is really the only reason I wasn't groaning through the entire movie. I didn't really find myself caring about a single character, although I will admit that the relationship/story arc between Arthur's mother and father had a cute ending scene, despite shamelessly trying to pull heart strings. 

Overall it was mediocre when you choose to overlook it's beauty. None of the performances uniquely stand out to me, although I don't think it's really the fault of the actors and actresses. Again, the plot felt like a videogame, perform X so you can do Y, and in the meantime watch the protagonist find himself and also fall in love. Defeat the bad guy so you can save the world, etc. I know the genre has become stale at this point, but that doesn't mean movies should get excuses to be allowed to be painfully predictable and unimaginative. The visuals and tightly shot action sequences are really the only highlights of the movie for me. ",a5yi33

A bit of romance/emotion, action now and then, jokes are in your face so even my grandma gets it, clear laid out story. Sort of lowest common denominator stuff, so the studio can appeal to the largest audience, and never step on anyone's toes.

Movies that get allowed to break out of these constraint are usually noteworthy. Like Spider-verse. 

I think it's just the age-old ""creative freedom of the writers vs constraints from the money men"".

Anyway, bringing it back to Spider-man. I think Spider-Verse broke out of these constraints, but Tom Holland's Spider-man Homecoming is bound by the constraints (albeit doing well). And for that reason, I'm worried that Far From Home will bring nothing new to the table. It needs to be carried by good acting and a pretty spectacle. I think that's also what carried Homecoming.

Someone else mentioned that one of the previous gender bender changes was simple visual changes (instead of a rotund male Doc Ock with bowl cut, it's a rotund female Doc Ock with a bowl). To me, this Spider-verse version was kind of awesome - the design modernizes Doc Ock with the look and attitude of a mildly eccentric, excited-in-new-advancements-lady-scientist that wouldn't be out of place on a college campus or Ted Talk (something the voice actress helped bring out). Others  commented on her new design visuals - the organic arms instead of the metal ones, and her hair being in the shape of an octopus' head.

Hell, Spiderman 3 had the added benefit that the director use to direct music videos before, so the movie is unwatchable due to being too jumpy. ",a5yi33
ebtts1f,Even Amazing Spider-Man 2 had good parts honestly. I considered the action in that movie to be the best in any Spider-Man movie (except for **the fucking** train scene and this movie).

ebuq0or,I just assume that's interdimensional travel being fucky and not necessarily lining up in terms of time. Remember they mentioned the earthquake the night before Gwen showed up? That was her getting transported into this dimension. Remember also there were Spideys from the 30s and the 2300s getting transported to present time,a5yi33

ec5yp8y,"They forced a lot of tracks from the soundtrack into the movie, but luckily it worked for the most part - they'd either use it to appropriately highlight an emotional moment, like Spidey's passing or Miles donning the suit, or they incorporated it as a diegetic sound, like Miles humming to a song or Ganky being too distracted by his loud music to spot the spider people.

I agree this movie was about Miles Morales, and it was great to see him develop into his universe's Spiderman, but I'm saying is if all the other characters were such a big part of the movie, I wish we learned more about them. As ridiculous as Nic Cage is as Noir Spiderman, I wanted to know more about him, his casting was funny.",a5yi33
ebu49mg,"I liked that too. I unfortunately knew that the Prowler was going to be his Uncle (if you like the MCU, Donald Glover plays Aaron Davis in Spider-Man: Homecoming and references Miles).

- more emotional than Infinity/Civil War
- funnier than Ragnarok or ant man
- more inspirational than Wonderwoman
- more epic than any of the avengers
- had better fight scenes than any of the MCU movies
- so colorful and gorgeous it made Guardians look like a black and white film comparatively 
- more imaginative than black panther
- also the best spider man since 2, and every iteration of spider man in it coulda kicked MCU spideys ass 

Honestly not sure what film in either franchise even comes close.

Tbh I was more irritated afterwards that we hadn't gotten more films like this from Marvel. And I've mostly loved the MCU so far. ",a5yi33

It felt like it was a bigger story that shrunk everytime they did a new draft of the script and now it's just a little slim. It didn't detract too much from the movie, but they do emphasize that a central part of all the spiderman stories is losing someone, and it made it a little hard to fully buy into Miles' loss when we didn't totally get the character he was losing.] (#spoiler)",a5yi33

ec04wr8,"I think that's the issue. Although those animated movies are great, because they are great in a different medium, it creates this perception amongst the audience that animated superhero movies aren't 'deserving' of the big screen and are 'meant' for TV.

It may have the best writing and be cinematic but you'd still 'weird' about if a 90 minute episode of it was played in theatres that you had to pay $20 for.

Like it was edited in such a build-up of a way that I thought for sure six web shooters from the spider-people that made the sacrifice to stay behind were going to come out and stop Kingpin's fists. Or Miles' dad was going to shoot Kingpin in retribution for his brother, distracting him long enough for Miles to deliver the shock. Or something like that. But instead, the fists land and then there's eerie silence. They Miles slowly stands while Kingpin stares. Not in exhausted incredulity. Just....stands there and stares.

But why didn’t Gwen try connecting to the alternate Peter? They don’t dive into that.

The other Peters must’ve known this timeline’s Spider-Man is dead at a minimum since they met Aunt May after her Spider-Man died. Admittedly they didn’t give a sense of time as to when they appeared but they were there long enough to know about the collider but not where it’s at. Just would’ve thought they’d be shown trying to figure out something instead of just hiding in the shadows until the plot arrives.

As for the last one, my main issue is thematically the idea that Mile’s dad thinks the new Spider-Man is a killer doesn’t go anywhere. He just at first thinks there’s a new Spider-Man and his brother died and then the next time he sees Spider-Man or mentions him he’s cheering for him to save the day. The thread goes nowhere. And it’s really hard to determine given the lack of backstory but from the little we understood we know the Prowler is a known bad guy if Miles can name drop him so Mile’s dad probably recognized his brother as a villain. My thoughts would be a new vigilante that’s capable of killing as he thinks he’s above the law.",a5yi33

ebtvnij,"Cmon man, I do take issue with the AI, but MCU Spidey has a different gadget for pretty much any situation he comes across, besides the ferry but still Tony shows up and saves him. Falls in water? Don’t worry the suit can warm itself up. Falling from high up? Got a parachute for that. Need to see something from afar? No problem, the spider on the suit flies away and watches things for you! Plus there’s over 500 different web shooter combinations! There’s no room for this Spidey to grow because he has it all and Stark is there to provide even more if need be. He even says he has pull at MIT when Peter previously had to make it to college on his own, while managing his life as Spider-Man along with it",a5yi33
ebtv091,"Well, how specific do you want me to get? In case you don’t want to be spoiled, what I mean is that he didn’t have a suit with all these Iron Man-esque gadgets and an AI or Tony there to help him with everything. Any gadgets he had he made himself (which is more believable considering how long he’s been Spider-Man and who he works for in the game), and his world feels very much like *his world*. 

I like Homecoming and MCU Spidey in general but I can’t stand this obsession Marvel seems to have with making Spider-Man a mini Iron Man. Peter doesn’t need Tony’s help to become a hero in his own right (people always bring up that Tony took his Iron Man-y suit away but that’s completely undone by the end of the movie and in Infinity War). A huge part of this to me is Uncle Ben. I get not wanting to show the origin again but not even a mention? It’s not like that part of his journey is just some repetitive story beat that could be done away with; what happened to Uncle Ben is what drives Spider-Man. His uncle’s death being indirectly his own fault is what gets him to put that suit on, it’s what made him realize what “with great power..etc.” means. He wants to make sure he can prevent the loss of other people’s “Uncle Bens”. And changing that to “I gotta impress Mr. Stark!” is a huge downgrade to me. Sorry I kinda went on and on but I hope whoever reads this has a better understanding of why I was disappointed by MCU Spidey and continue to be",a5yi33

I went to see a 3D showing last night - it is *breathtaking*, literally, in 3D. Especially when he jumps off the buildings and is falling through the air. In other 3D films where I saw characters taking leaps, the experience was always something of a thrill ride, but in this film is was like watching Cirque du Solei or something.

As for Penni and Noire I personally feel that Penni was wasted in that they didn't really establish a personality for her or something about her world that would impact the way she communicates. I mean I would imagine the speaking to people from hundreds of years in the past would be at least strange. 

Noire on the other hand I absolutely loved and never said otherwise, I thought his dialogue was great and his design and actions made him stand out basically whenever he was on the screen. I really hope to see more of him in the future.",a5yi33

It's happened with other films. I remember in the trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy, they had the characters stand in a police line-up with exposition given about their backstories. All of them were used in the final film... except for Drax's. It ticked me off then, it ticks me off now.",a5yi33

So, the spider was from another reality, but we don't know which one. Most likely it didn't come from Ham or Noir's reality, given their color-schemes and character history. But beyond that, we don't know. Given the time-travel shenanigans, it could have been from the 2099 Spider-Man's reality, with him sending it back to ensure that Miles got his powers.

edlv1qx,"> That's like casting photography aside from live action films, it's dumb.

Why ? Photography is only a part of the visual aspect of the movie (along with composition, editing, acting, etc). Photography alone doesn't make a movie interesting, even from a visual standpoint - unless you're working in that field, or you're really interested in that aspect of moviemaking, but either way you can't expect regular dudes to be excited by photography *alone*. If photography is the only highlight in an otherwise *meh* movie, well, it's worth mentioning, but it's not a redeeming factor for its failures. (Not talking about Spider-Verse here - it's an example)

Same thing with the art style in an animated movie : it's an important element of a movie's visual identity, probably even more important than photography in live-action movies - but that's all. It can still be hindered, or sublimed, by other factors.

And as I said in my comment, Spider-Verse left me a bit unsatisfied from a visual perspective. 

That's all. I'm not denying that Spider-Verse's art style is good and interesting. But I don't think the movie is interesting enough, visually, to recommend it to people who aren't *that much* into animated movies - or who are a bit tired of superhero movies. The art style won't be enough change their minds - or to change anyone's mind, IMO.",a5yi33

I wasn't really sold on Miles Morales, not really having read many Ultimate comics. My impression of him was Peter Parker But Black. 

This movie totally brought me around. Miles is a great, well-written character with unique flaws and strengths (at least in Spider-Verse) and makes a hell of a Spider-Man.

Yes. No doubt the animation was amazing. There are things you can’t do in love action that you can do in animation. That said, I feel it went over the top in some places. 

What I liked about Homecoming is that there wasn’t a backstory. There would’ve been complaints about another Uncle Ben killing. Homecoming was more about looking forward rather than looking back. With a new Spider-Man (Miles) that the general audience doesn’t know, a new origin story is a no-brainer. I appreciate that they didn’t take the easy rod either. I mean daring to pull different versions of the character is pretty ballsy. I wish it would’ve showcased how they were different though. I felt shortchanged from Noir, Peni and Ham a bit. As well as Gwen to be honest. Besides being aesthetically different, they all had pretty much the same powers. 

I really didn’t understand Doc Ock. I know Otto from Spider-Man 2, so is this his wife or just another version of the villain? Just making it a woman wasn’t interesting enough for me. 

The Lord/Miller humor was all over this. It was definitely the funniest of them all. Honestly, it didn’t make me feel much else except all the quick gags of humor. In all, it was a great tip of the hat to the comics which this character came from. I liked it for accomplishing that. 

Yeah. Kingpin was a bit much. I understood his motivation and sympathized with him, but the movie didn’t give much time or attention to fleshing this out. Compare that with Keaton’s Vulture. 

I’ll say I liked Holland’s Spider-Man because he was that neighborhood hero. He sought out ways to help even if he was over his head and had to be brought down to earth. He made me feel his helplessness when he was just a kid under all that rubble and had to look inside himself for the strength to get out of it without any help or a suit. His whole goal was to be a hero. I dint think that’s a bad thing. ",a5yi33

If you try to mix their style and method of direction with a behemoth like Disney, that gives their filmmakers a list of things that MUST be in the movie and certain limitations on things like number of locations that must be featured, number of characters with x amount of screen time, no  making this character unsympathetic, maximum amount of time between action set pieces is x, ... etc. then it turns out *worse* than just a bad movie. It doesn't just dilute the quality of their work, it makes it like literally unwatchable which their cut of Solo apparently was. Like, the sum of the footage turned in at the end wasn't even able to form a coherent plot and there were massive holes in the story and the tone/humor just clashed horribly with itself. 


Firing L&M from Solo was almost certainly the correct move because what they turned in at essentially near the end of principle photography was flat out not a releasable movie, not even close. The huge mistake in the first place was hiring them, knowing what they do, and letting them go nuts with ideas and do their thing while **also** giving them this big check list of requirements that was always going to fundamentally corrupt and deflate what they do. 

So apparently the dailies they were sending back to Disney every day where individually great, but putting all the footage together shot to meet Disney's requirements made the whole thing just not a watchable movie. It turns out even the ""Alden Erenreich"" is so terrible that Disney had to hire an acting coach thing was L&M's fault because, as seen in the actual final film, Alden is actually great and did a great job at capturing a young Han without seeming like he was imitating Ford the way Glover was Billy Dee Williams. The only reason he wasn't doing well on set was because of L&M directing him to give a weird tone or something that he didn't understand what they wanted from him and wasn't really jiving with the other actors or what he knew he was supposed to be doing with the character so L&M weren't getting what *they* wanted, again, because of clashing with the limits of a big Disney property. L&M have to have complete control or don't bother hiring them. You dilute them and get ""Diet Lord and Miller"" which is what Disney wanted for Solo. 



A much as I dislike many of the moves Kathleen Kennedy has made as head of Lucasfilm, I will still say that her being able to get a film in theaters on it's established premiere date, without pushing it back, that was not only watchable/serviceable, but actually pretty good and a lot of fun... after being given 90% of a film that is unwatchable and unfixable, is almost miraculous.

Remember how we all suspected that MJ secretly knew that Peter was Spidey in the early parts of SM2?

It turned out she legitimately didnt know and only gave it a passing thought. 

Thus my logic is basically this, if someone doesnt explicitly tell you that they know...then they dont know. The only exception is Lucius Fox in the Batman series, but you'd have to be a moron to be giving Bruce Wayne so much tech and not put two and two together.

Aunt May had no reason to believe that Peter somehow acquired superhuman strength, speed, and agility.

Fisk may have killed him but Spidey would have died from internal bleeding eventually. Just look at the way he *looked.* He was lying to Miles when he said he'd join him. Dude knew he was dying.

It's not fair to compare a healthy, emotionally rejuvenated Miles to a crippled Spider-Man coughing up blood. I dont care how much more experience the original Spidey has, the guy was clearly unable to get up.

And besides, did you really not cheer for Miles when he finally comes into his own? 

A lesser movie would have let Peter B. Parker be a total moron for the whole film just to make Miles look good. Depressed as Parker was, he got shit done when it needed to get done. 

Was Miles a little OP at the end, yeah. But we see him still goof up in small ways. He slips off the wall when wall crawling at the end of the movie. He *barely* wins against Kingpin and the win is hugely symbolic as it represented Uncle Aaron's memory.

His move at the end of the film wasnt even his own...he *copied* the original Spider-Man with the way *he* swung to the top of the Collider machine.

I enjoy basically all of the MCU movies (even Dark World) it's just that I don't want to watch them again that much (GotG I and Thor III come closest because of the humor).

Spider Verse, though? I could see it go into the regular rotation along with  The Big Lebowski, Die Hard, Princess Bride, Groundhog Day, Star Wars, Up and Incredibles I.

It clearly was an artistic choice though. Gives it more of a comic feel. You don't just make a massive artistic decision with framing just because of budget when the rest of the art direction is mathematic and deliberate. It'll be completely obvious.   


Now with that said some people are sensitive to different things. If it doesn't work for you doesn't mean that ""the fans"" find it nauseating, just that you're in the minor demographic does. I could never play PS1 Spyro because it gave me a headache. Just how things go sometimes.",a5yi33

There isn't a single scene that is all low frame-rate for a film. I think you're getting distracted by the characters that are given a lower amount of frames in their animation esp. in speaking situations but it's clearly an artistic choice as the background and non-characters are always at full framerate. It's a very fascinating effect to me but  I wasn't bothered by it because the overall scene is in full frame (there is no scene where character is say ""10 fps"" and a bus going by is also that).

I noticed that its so deliberate that when a character is doing the action (whether it is walking or even turning when swinging) it has that choppy-feel even when the rest of the scene is panning at full framerate - but when physics is acting on Spidey falling or swinging it's also at full framerate (and it would look ridiculous if it wasn't).

Best example: 

https://youtu.be/tg52up16eq0?t=74

Stare at the trees and you'll see nothing ""low"" frame rate about it. But Miles is turning around with like the equivalent of 5 fps. There is nothing major film-wise that you'll save doing that beyond a few more hours of render time. The keyframes are there, you just have to dial up a number. It's deliberate.

Also for Infinity War, the beauty of it is the fact that it is the payoff for 10 years and 20 movies. Taken on it's own, it's an average film with really weird pacing.

Miles tells his uncle about a girl he likes, gets advice on how to make his move, makes his move, later Peter is smiling knowingly as Miles lies about the thing breaking to make himself look better, and at the end of the film they are obviously about to kiss (just like any other superhero would kiss any nearby girl in any other movie) before Miles friendzones himself rather than upset people with an interracial relationship. 

If anything, I could see that being why the black woman was upset; it’s 2018 and black men still better keep their hands off of white women. But yes, what someone else said about white people trying to do black cutler can ring hollow at times; not being black, I lack that specific perspective I think.",a5yi33

Sure, he never straight up monologues to Gwen or Peter about his school troubles, but that wouldn't make any sense, he's trying to impress them. ",a5yi33
emm2zkb,"Probably because it was a stupid example to begin with that doesn't have anything to do with this. You want to ignore how Miles Morales was already an established character to begin with? You know what he was in the comics? A Black Mexican. Nobody ""changed"" anything about him. He was this race to begin with. The character of ""Spider-Man"" has never applied to just Peter Parker. Miles Morales and Peter Parker are two completely different characters. You're basically just getting mad that Peter Parker's successor isn't white, which is pretty stupid.

There's outrage culture over race all the time on both sides. People complained about Micheal B. Jordan playing The Human Torch, Grover from the Percy Jackson series being black in the movies, and Rue from The Hunger Games being black. You know what's especialy idiotic about that last one? Rue was described as being dark skinned in the books. People complained that a black character was black in the movie. On the other hand, the main character Katniss isn't even described as white in the books, but she's white in the movies. The Ancient One from Doctor Strange is Asian, but in the movie she's white.

You know what makes people forget that at the end of the day? A good performance. If your merit on an actor is literally ""they don't match the skin color of previous depections"" then how you judge characters is incredibly shallow and narrow-minded.",a5yi33

I was surprised it wasn’t in the final cut because if I remember right it had made it all the way through the animation stage in the test screening. It was also one of my favorite scenes (despite the fact that I’m having so much trouble actually remembering it lmao) 

They showed the entire film to us but different scenes were at varying levels of completeness. I’d say a little more than half the film was fully rendered and ready to go, and then the rest was a mix between storyboards, layout, and animation without effects. It was funny because that heart to heart scene where miles dad tries to talk to him though the door was still in layout stage during some parts, so it was this really poignant scene that kept being parodied by the fact that miles character model was like t posing throughout the whole thing. 

The first half of the film had more fully completed scenes so very little changed from what I saw in the test screening. A lot of the laboratory infiltration sequence hadn’t been taken to animation yet though so it was very cool to see those scenes completed. And the fight at aunt mays house was still in storyboard mode. I’m kind of convinced the character of scorpion wasn’t in the film I saw *at all* because I have no memory of him but all the scenes he was in were in storyboard and those were the most confusing to follow so.

They could have easily kept the original Peter alive or watered down Fisk, but thankfully the writers were just like ""lets just tell the best story we can."" 

Like you, I was disappointed with Infinity War. It goes without saying that it was a *massive* achievement, but when they only got rid of the sequel characters...it was like, come on guys. Unlike you though, I dont even think the mcu will have the balls to kill the original Avengers off. I think the ending of Endgame will wrap up with the original members simply leaving. (Tony gets married to Pepper and has a kid or something, etc). 

The beauty of this movie being animated is that it was so beneath the studio's radar that the writers could actually sneak a ton of brutality in. The MCU is just too big to allow any real stakes. The days of Winter Soldier seem far away, and as good as Black Panther and Ragnarok were, Infinity War basically screwed both of those movies over and now the BP and Spider-Man sequels have to either ignore it or be set up in a way that clearly says ""Infinity War was erased."" 

Oddly this movie's tone leans closer to Netflix's Daredevil than it does near the film MCU. By that I mean it just allows itself to be its own thing and lets the world be as brutal as it needs to be.

In this animated movie, death means *death.* The original Peter Parker *stays dead.* His death is given weight. Kingpin shoots Prowler. He doesnt electrocute the suit or anything lame, he just *shoots him.* Fisk comes close to killing Miles in the climax. Prowler feels like a real threat. 

I dont need a ton of blood, but just show me that the stakes are real and I'll be with you. This movie earned a *lot of my respect* when it killed off the original Peter. It was already clearly a well made movie, but that scene showed me ""oh, this is going to be something to really take seriously.""",a5yi33

Considering how far we are from serious recognition for animated movies and superhero movies alike, it would be absolutely huge if two superhero movies with black leads, one of which was a Sony Pictures Animation, PG-rated movie where a cartoon pig gives a kid a giant hammer, both got nominated for Best Picture. It would be great, of course, and I think if ever an animated movie really deserved to bring home the gold, this would be the one, but I simply don't think we're at that level culturally.",a5yi33

ed9xzy0,"According to the 616 universe, the original Prowler was a young kid with an engineering degree who decided to build a suit that he could use to commit robberies, but was talked out of it by Spider-Man.

In the Ultimate universe (the one Miles originally comes from) he was a cat-burglar who gets involved in more violent crimes and eventually fight Miles but dies when his glove overloads and explodes. 

If I had to cobble together a guess, I'd say that Aaron of the Spider-Verse film started out in a similar way to both men; a brilliant but wayward burglar who got involved with the Kingpin, and was pulled into a spiral of increasingly violent crimes until it became who he was. Fisk keeps him under his thumb through a combination of upgrades to his gear and the mere fact that Fisk owns everything in New York, making any betrayal short-lived, as the movie proved. ",a5yi33

An example of this done well would be Captain America 1. It handled Steve Rogers honestly without overdoing that somewhat corny facade over the top of his character.

I agree Homecoming shouldn't have included the backstory again, but at least references to it. Like ""my uncle would have wanted me to..."" small hints.

Very true that this Doc Oct wasn't fleshed out very well simply because of the number of villains. Comic fans I'm sure appreciated it, I know I did. Basically all of the universes have small twists on the story, like in Gwen's world, Frank Castle (Punisher) is a cop.

Glad me agree on the humor.

You're right, but to be fair: Keaton is incredible and the Vulture was the only villian in that film.

This is true as well, but I suppose I just prefer the emotional struggles/self doubt Miles faces to Holland's struggles because many of them are boilerplate, like the ""hero trapped in rubble and finds the strength within to overcome"" troupe that's in like 75% of action movies. Plus the message of Spiderverse was that anyone can be a hero which I personally preferred over Homecoming's ""you don't have to save the world to be a hero.""

Basically it had better sound experience than an regular showing of a film. My local cinema had reclining seat that shook, that were synced up with scenes and/or music during movie. 


I tend to stay away from 3D movies because of the effect that you described. So I don't have a lot of experience to compared the 3D Spider-man version to others. But I felt that the producers did a great job of converting it into 3D. It didn't feel like a gimmick and done tastefully; if that makes sense. 

Also the sound projection in a dolby cinema version is much better than what you will hear in an Imax version. I just came back from viewing Aquaman at an Imax, it was far too loud and felt like I was constantly being bombarded. I'm not sure if it was because of the sound design of the movie or if the cinema manager had it too loud or if it was suppose to be that loud and I should keep my mouth shut.

It's not bad enough to crossover into being good. But it's not good enough to be enjoyed either.

I assumed the robot had a connection with her father, in the scene where the spider-verse people were sharing their painful experiences, Peni said 'For me, it was my father'. I've seen anime where the protags use tech (like robot suits) that was built by deceased parents (Bubblegum Crisis), and I feel like I've seen this in comic books/cartoons in general (I can't name any off the top of my head). So, the robot suit/armor/companion technology becomes a connection with their deceased parents. 

EDIT: Voltron seems to fit this (Voltron's creator, the King and Dad of the princess, was dead, but they used his tech).

At that point in their lives though Aunt May knows Peter *so much* better than MJ does. 

If there was any person in that entire universe who might know that Peter was Spidey it'd be Aunt May.

I'm not saying she definitely knew, but just because MJ didn't that doesn't convince me that Aunt May didn't, they are two very different characters with very different relationships to Peter.

If I had to guess when Aunt May first suspected it would probably be when Doc Ock first shows up in the bank and Peter leaves his aunt behind and runs away like a coward, only for Spidey to show up a few seconds later.

He barely won by shocking the Kingpin once which sent him flying and staying shocked until he was defeated? Sure. The original Spiderman would've died anyway? Are you serious. Left alone, his healing factor would help him slowly recover. He was killed by taking a direct undefended overhead blow from the kingpin. Miles is a young teenager who just got his powers.

ec0xzbq,"Most people are a sucker for MCU humor so you're not alone but I just think more than often it detracts from the story or the drama of the moment. So often the MCU uses humor to bail them out of being too dramatic. Too many scenes are capped off with a stupid quip and it feels like a massive cop out.  A big example of that is when Thor is watching his home blow up and Korg comes in with a joke. What should be the most dramatic moment in the film is now reduced to yet another joke becuase it's easier to make the crowd laugh than to make them actually feel something genuine. Such a cop out and you can find those moments in almost every single mcu film.

I agree with you about how they're not that rewatchable and for me a huge part of that is because they prioritise ""fun"" over genuine stakes and heart. They're perfect movies to have on the TV because all they strive to do is look shiny and make you laugh but I can't agree when people call them good movies.

ecw5y4z,"I wish I could upvote this more than once. I came here to talk about the framerate specifically, and your comment pretty much said it all. I was *really* worried about it when I first saw the trailers for this, but in the movie itself it is clear that they are deliberately cutting down the framerate for specific characters, in specific scenes. The fact that everything else was running at a normal, ""smooth"" framerate made it all okay for me.

Still, I think once the Blu-Ray is out I'll try to put it through ffmpeg's minterpolate filter to crank up the framerate. I think it might preserve the effect of having different objects rendered in different framerates but make the action scenes even more spectacular. Worth giving it a try at least, imo.

I think it was maybe some holiday or something where he was back home and school started again because he was already going there but hated it. The security guard who chases him inside the school was confronting him about sneaking off campus at night (when he went to visit Uncle Aaron where he got the advice for shoulder arm Hey and the graffiti spider bit), after Spider Man died he ran home and his father started saying ""you made a commitment to stay at the school"" after Miles asked if he could stay the night back in his parents home.

It's that there's *just* enough advertising to remind you that this is nothing more than blatant product placement. 

If you don't mind being advertised at so much after paying to see a movie, more power to you. This was a major turn off for me.

The magic hour bike chase, the raccoon set-piece, the character designs. It's not as immediately surface-level stylish as *Into the Spider-Verse*'s attempt to recreate the look of comic books, right down to the paneling and onomatopoeias, but to say it doesn't make use of the animated form is to expose oneself as ignorant of the craft. *All* animation is an abstraction beyond live action and sacrifices the photographic art as movies. You'll never organically get, [David Bordwell describes](http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2007/04/20/but-what-kind-of-art/), shots like the fan spinning on the railroad track in *A Summer at Granpa's*. But in return, animators have complete control over the visual space of their movies and therefore a greater contrast between what and how things are shown. So no, ""literally"" (as opposes to figuratively?) the entirety of *Incredibles 2* would not be the same in live action. I remember people saying the same thing about *Perfect Blue.* It's shallow criticism. ",a5yi33

There's no fluid James Baxter animated dance scene, for example. Likewise, one could also adapt *Into the Spider-Verse* in a way that is satisfactory in its own way. But this misses the point. Animation is just a different medium and every animated movie by default inherits certain qualities and loses others. Just because *Spider-Verse* has some stylish flourishes does not in any way make it more of an animated movie than *Incredibles 2* or *Beauty and the Beast*. It's just a more obvious thing people who don't know much about or have much appreciation for animation can point to in absence of more meaningful things to say about the movie.",a5yi33

The spiderverse's animation was a key part of its tone and style of the film. Blending multiple styles together to really bring together and highlight character traits and actions. With complete disregard for matching realty at times bringing out some truely amazing scenes.

They were immediately established as ""easy"" to do and totally broken, but without experience Miles could only do them under stress, which made the reveals themselves really fun and interesting moments. The new Spiderman having such busted tricks is a nice little light of hope in a world in need of a new Spiderman, and the other Spider people know this so they really push Miles to figure out how to do them on command (which seems like the only thing holding the powers back), and I found it reallt satisfying when he finally built up the resolve and got over how scared he was, at this point it only makes sense that he can use his unique powers effectively. And him having these powers is what let's him take the moral victory by avenging his uncle. I did think the ""Hey"" was a bit of a silly way for him to land a venom strike on Kingpin, but it did drive that point home and it kinda made sense, since Kingpin had never seen a Spiderman use anything like that before so it caught him off guard, which is really the only way Miles could have beat him. ",a5yi33
ehyzwyo,"> Additional powers? Makes no sense.

Well, we know of one other person bitten by a Spider... well, ok, we apparently know of infinite people/pig people bitten by spiders, but we know Peter mostly. 

The spider that bit Miles looked *very* different than the one that bit Peter, so I don't really see an issue with it giving him different powers.

I was actually wondering if he was weaker physically than Peter. It might be that his powers were still developing, or he's just physically smaller and hasn't fully matured into his adult body, but he seemed to have a harder time carrying a body around than I would expect a Spider-Man to have.

I'm not convinced blonde Peter would have died anyway, if he'd been able to escape his healing factor might have repaired him, but I do think his massive injuries made it much easier for Kingpin to kill him with one blow.

Still I found myself saying ""get up, get up"" under my breath during the final showdown with Kingpin. Felt like an idiot for doing it but the drama worked in Spider Verse. That was the only real part where the drama hit me, even the dad talk with the closed door didn't quite penetrate. So good stuff, but not quite Frozen (Let it Go etc. have been so overplayed in the last few years that it's easy to forget what a good movie Frozen is) in the drama department.

I specifically said he's an exceptional human. He's just not a serious physical obstacle for Spider-Man. You can find countless examples in the comics where Spidey beats him after a quick kerfuffle. I think Spider-Man has also talked about holding back when punching normal people which would explain how Kingpin is able to hold his own in fights with Spidey for even a few blows.

In *Homecoming,* I felt almost none of that. They *tried* with the whole Peter in the rubble thing, but then they cut to *Tony Stark's* voice. 

The hell?

Why do the writers seem hellbent on making Peter *desperate* to be an Avenger?

Peter should not have to learn about responsibility. He learned it when reflecting upon Uncle Ben's death. That's also the problem with the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon. You have *all these people* trying to school Spidey on responsibility. 

That's like having a bunch of superheroes show up and try to teach Clark Kent how to be a hero. Oh wait, *Smallville.* 😁

Pete doesnt need other heroes to teach him stuff. He doesnt dress up in the costume and risk his personal life for *no damn reason.*

He goes through a very personal trauma that shapes his entire identity. You can't just ignore Uncle Ben. At least mention him.

ecml9h1,"Raimi: Pathetic nerd the audience can project onto gets superpowers, as a result beats up bully, gets hot girl, becomes a cool superhero. Everyone who's critical of him is just being mean for no reason. The villian is a crazy person who just decides to ruin Spider-Man's life for no particular reason, because he already completed his initial goal without spider-man stopping him but we still have an hour of movie left. He gets gored to death with his glider because... hubris i guess. His love interest is treated like a prize he wins after saving her from a bunch of rapists. She exists to get kidnapped and scream a lot.  

Webb: a boy who wants to help people but lacks the means to do so is suddenly granted unimaginable power, but his initial attempts to use it for good only cause more problems, and he learns that hurting people who are bad isn't really justice, but getting even. His critic is a professional crime fighter who makes several good points about how revenge doesn't actually help anyone, and ultimately inspires his growth into a hero who's main focus is to selflessly help people. His villian's motivation mirrors him: another man on the quest to use power to help people, but who does not learn the same lessons about revenge and accountability that Peter does. The two are on mirrored journeys: one learning to be critical of his own altruistic actions, questioning whether his good intentions are tainted by his own personal vendettas, while the other allows his self righteousness to justify doing what he thinks is the right thing, no matter who gets hurt in the process. The villain is ultimately redeemed by Peter's self sacrifice. Peter's love interest is an actual human person who he starts a healthy relationship with based on mutual attraction, and who does lots of stuff that isn't getting kidnapped or screaming. ",a5yi33

To me, they fit right in despite their out of place-ness. Their intention, specifically Spider-Ham's, was humor oriented. He's a talking pig. Knowing them now, I'd be disappointed to lose them. I love Spider-Ham's Looney Tunes inspired comedy as well as Peni's anime-esque style. We didn't get a lot of time outside their initial origins to go into their world, which is okay - they're not the main characters.

I understand your opinions. Maybe they can do more for them in the sequel, but Spider-Ham is the funniest thing in this move for me. Probably due to his Looney Tune-esque comedy.",a5yi33

None of this means *Incredibles 2* chances aren't good. They are, but it's hardly a lock-in for the win in the same way, say, *Coco* was last time. I've been doing Oscar prediction for almost ten years now and I'm usually right for all but maybe three or four of the categories every year (sometime I even get all but one), so trust me when I say the Animated Feature category will probably be tricky this time.

ebt80tm,"I do have a lot reverence for Spider-Man, ever since I was but a lad watching him on Saturday mornings thirty years ago.

My Avengers analogy does work because although the Peter that dies is a minor character in this film's *narrative* he is a major character in the *story* of Spider-Man. He is that universe's original Spider-Man and although technically we only knew him for ten minutes, he is so recognisable as classic Spider-Man, we may as well have known him for ten years or more.

But even if you want to switch to your Wolverine analogy, then it is still badly handled in my opinion. If that is what was done with the Wolverine on screen, fans would go crazy as it would cheapen the character and cheapen the integrity of the overall story. In fact in the 'Infinity Gauntlet' comic, Wolverine goes up against Thanos and although he obviously cannot beat him, the confrontation is written so that fans of the character still feel that old Wolvy got his due.

Look at Star Trek, if you want to show how dangerous something is with a quick death, you throw a Red Shirt at it. The audience does not know them (they don't even have names) but their death gets across that the situation you are seeing on screen is very dangerous for our hero(es). But if you want to kill a named character that is important to the plot, you have to give over significant story time to them to sell it properly e.g. The Wrath of Khan, which is practically a whole film for Spock's death.

&#x200B;

But look, I loved 'Into the Spider-Verse', one of the most fun of the year and the best animated film I have seen in quite some time. But that one thing of how an important and valuable character that the audience instantly recognises, knows and loves (I mean the film is about Spider-Men and he is a Spider-Man) was brushed aside for the benefit of our main character's development, I thought could have been handled better without necessarily damaging anything else in the film.",a5yi33

I'm saying the film could not have been economically made if the whole thing were animated (not exhibited, that's different) at a constant 24 fps. The filmmakers have said they ""traded"" 24 frame character animation-- which is more expensive and time consuming-- so that they could have flexibility elsewhere, like more time to work on the story and less box office pressure. And they were happy to do so, because they liked the look of the 12-frame animation. But the film would not have been able to go forward without that choice, and likely would not have seen the many other benefits that come from having a relaxed budget. ",a5yi33

Gwen mentioned that her spidey sense told her to go to the school to find Miles, so my guess is that Peni, Porker, and Noir had a similar spidey sense that they followed and eventually found each other with. Then they feasibly could have travelled to Aunt May's house as a group in the 1-2ish days between Parker Prime's death and Miles, Gwen, and Peter B. Parker's arrival.

ed3uiut,"For one, I should have specified I was referring to anime. Take a look at some shots from Akira or Cowboy Bebop and you'll see the 'choppy' framerate effect that the movie was going for.

For two, I said *as much*. In 2D, going from 12 to 24 fps would involve literally twice as much work for the animators, and therefore twice the cost. That cost factor is significant enough to impact the entire medium, and is largely why so much anime continues to be at a low frame rate to this day.

In 3D, even though rendering cost can double (I won't get into the technicalities), the cost of animating will only be marginally more as the computer is already supplying most of the in-between frame information. Still more work to be done, but not nearly as much by comparison. So the cost of higher frame rates doesn't have much impact on the medium - you'll see low-budget 3D productions that still have 60 fps.

The point is - though It may not appeal to you personally, it was a conscious decision with an artistic vision behind it.",a5yi33
edab21w,"Doing character animation on the two's actually made Spider-Verse more expensive and difficult to make. They spent a significant amount of time creating a unique workflow for a style of art that hadn't been done before. The unique style allowed them to use some hand-drawn animation standbys, like flubbed smear frames, that are common in 2D animation but have probably never really been done before in a 3D animated movie. They also wanted to call more attention to key character ""poses,"" which are harder to pick up when animation is done on the ones. The style definitely has drawbacks, but after you get used to the quirks there are potentially some nice and unique things about the style. It feels less ""smooth"" than 24 fps character animation, but it also feels ""crisper."" Is it better? Worse? Hard to say, these things are more subjective than the ""objective review"" crowd likes to admit. But it's different, and I appreciate that.

Also, the movie isn't rendered in 12 fps. It's rendered in 24 fps, like pretty much all other movies. Much of the animation is done ""on the two's,"" but that only affects character and object animations, not background or, necessarily, character movements. (Yes, character movement can be at a higher frame rate than character animation: For instance, a lot of 2D video game character sprites animate at a lower frame-rate than the game moves at. A single pose can be held for multiple frames, even if the character is falling down or sliding around.) So Spider-Verse is essentially the same as most anime and fair amount of Western 2D animation as well.",a5yi33

This movie showed what Homecoming lacked. 

And don't get me started how Homecoming's Peter was a dick to his friends but the moment he changes his mind and decides to be cool his friends welcome him back. He left Ned at the party by himself. Zero repercussions for leaving his boy. And he was a dick to the trivia club or whatever it was he was a part of and the moment he comes back everyone is happy-go-lucky. It was an odd film that left a sour taste in my mouth. No t to mention, it reinforces a strange mentality. Peter can be an asshole, he just needs to learn that he shouldn't be. Which didn't happen.

Probably wouldn't see it in Imax again, I don't need all that jazz. Some of the humor fell flat with me but some might like it. Felt that the romance was unnecessary, just a another pet-peeve of mine. Just another aspect that I don't care for when a director puts it into a movie that doesn't need it. The romance wasn't shoehorned into the plot per-say but I'm sure DC will make another Aquaman and that aspect of the movie could have been built upon in the next movie they will surely make. ",a5yi33

Anyway, I don't get why you're debating this with me if your interest in these characters is only in passing. My issue would largely only be of concern to long-term fans of the character or people very interested in analysing narratives (of which I am both).

Which is a perfectly reasonable position for him to take, but isn’t a great fit for the Spider-Man character who has always been more about being a little reckless, making mistakes and then having to deal with and learn from the consequences.

Miles and Peter both do that in their respective movies, but the people around Miles celebrate him for doing it and treat him more as a peer, while Tony treats him more like a kid that needs to be coddled and protected from making mistakes in the first place.",a5yi33

ecqujn5,"First off, I like this movie more than Homecoming. This is the definitive Spider-Man movie IMO and I’d love to see more in this universe. 

However, Miles and MCU Peter have very different trajectories and it feels unfair to compare them. Miles finished his arc before the final fight even starts. He is Spider-Man before that point. Peter spends the whole of Homecoming THINKING that he’s Spider-Man when he’s really just a kid in a cool suit (the whole “If you’re noting without this suit, then you shouldn’t have it” exchange between Tony and Peter). It’s not until the rubble scene that he starts to become Spider-Man. It’s a matter of pacing and the franchise that I think you have an issue with. Miles has a pretty self contained story whereas Peter is part of a huge franchise that shows no signs of stopping anytime soon. He’s growing as a person and as a hero, but it’s just spread out over more movies. If you don’t like that that’s fine but that’s a personal thing, not the movie’s fault.
