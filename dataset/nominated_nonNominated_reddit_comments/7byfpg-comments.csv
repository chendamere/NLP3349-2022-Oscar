The first when Poirot boarded the train, and then walked to his room. Wonderful introduction to the setting and a nice way to show you the layout of the train.

dplsfel,"I wasn’t a fan of Branagh’s direction for Thor, but I appreciated a lot of the camera flourishes here - the top down-perspective of Depp’s cabin, the not that subtle split-glass face shot of Dafoe, the long tracking shot as Poirot first boards the train. Good stuff. 

The real star of the movie is the sleeping protector for the mustache. I wasn’t sure if they’d switch up the ending, but the staging of the final summation was a great scene - especially the victim’s-eye view of the murder. ",7byfpg
dpobjg2,"I enjoyed this film a lot. Made me want to go back and watch the original! The cinematography was quite good, but I do believe the star of the show was (as usual with this guy) Branagh himself. I felt like his Poirot was a ton of fun. I enjoyed his performance so much. I think part of the charm was that in a film where the rest of the characters were played so straight and serious most of the time, down to earth as it were, Poirot's larger than life personality was charming and energetic. And, importantly, it was not so overblown that it was jarring or overly unbelievable. For those who don't love slow mysteries as much as myself, I think it will be little draggy in the middle, but, as someone who has a soft spot for any kind of murder mystery, I loved it.

I also felt that the ending’s culprit, (spoiler all of them) was very weird, but when Poirot did his monologue while walking through the train about people loosing their ways and how one crime had turned into many, I came to terms with it.

dpulqzg,"To the people complaining about the plot, this is typical Christie - Poirot's 'methods' are 90% guesswork which he calls 'the little gray cells', there's very little actual deduction in her books either.

e.g. one character says she teaches geography, another makes some vague reference, so of course the 2 must be the same person, never mind the incredible odds. This kind of stupidity is there in the stories as well.

The movie is good for what it was - great visuals,  set pieces and CGI. And the music in the 3rd act is incredible, that for me was almost worth it.

In the end, there will only be one David Suchet, the rest are pretenders. But I'm glad films like this still get made. It made me sad to go for a 9.30pm show and the theater was completely empty (there were only 3 people including me!) in a major metro area.",7byfpg
dqntuz5,"Personally I thought this was one of the worst movies of the year and Branagh completely butchered the story with his disregard for the genre. My biggest gripe is that it is poorly paced and doesn't do any of the detective work that is to be expected of a story like this. As many people have noted, the film wastes too much time focusing on irrelevant points and shoehorns too many things (like an ill-conceived racial commentary and a random chase scene in the snow lol). It completely forgets that you have let the audience in so that any tension is build up with the audience trying to solve it as well or else its just a bare crime thriller. Characters are poorly introduced and developed, where some of them are just mindlessly neglected and only appear whenever they are needed. For example, the film is so lazy that it causally puts a montage scene for some of the characters despite the fact the audience should feel everyone is a suspect, but the film spends too much time on Daisy Ridley and Josh Gadd. 

The film really falls apart by the final third where it feels like Branagh is just rushing it with rapid-fire interrogation scene and the mystery is never let to simmer. Perhaps one of the most egregious part is where [Michelle Piffer's character gets stabbed (a change in the book) but the film never addresses this again and immediately cuts to the next scene despite being of vital importance. Similarly, where the doctor later shoots Poirot, the next scene is immediately the denouement without any consequences for the doctor](#spoiler). This has to be by far the worst denouement put on screen where there little flow and reasoning to how Poirot in this film got to his conclusions. Instead, it puts this bizzare moral thesis that is hard to believe given that the 'smartest detective in the world' surely isn't dumb enough to see the world as black and white... 

I immediately went to see the 1974 Lumet's version and fell in love with that. That is how it should be properly done with the mystery being the forefront and every character given the appropriate screen time. The 1974 manages to put the Armstrong side story at the forefront making it make a lot more sense in the context of the film which the 2017 version completely butchers. I love this genre of films and seriously hope more would be made (including a revised Sherlock Holmes), but this adaptation doesn't give me much hope unfortunately. ",7byfpg

dpo73uh,"Decent but not one of the better adaptations of the novel.

The biggest problem is that Branagh is such a screen hog. It might work for something like *Hamlet* but not for *Murder on the Orient Express*. The Christie story is actually the perfect vehicle for an ensemble cast. It has a larger than usual suspect list. Ideally, the audience should suspect each character in turn.

This didn't happen since many of the characters were poorly introduced and then mostly disappeared until the interrogation towards the end. I say this as someone who's read the novel and seen several of the adaptations: I could barely remember who was supposed to be whom, where they were supposed to be, and what their ""angle"" was. Clues weren't emphasized in the heavy-handed way a mystery requires. There was little direction or misdirection beyond the bare minimum.

Still, I hope Branagh makes more Poirots. Some of the other stories are probably better for focusing on the main role. If he does though, he should commit to the genre and not just the character.",7byfpg

(can't get the spoiler markdown to work)

[Question:

why did the doctor ask poirot, ""why aren't you dead yet?"" when they were wrestling in the train?

Analysis:

here is what everyone is missing: the movie breaks from the book in a big way by adding an additional twist. the armstrong peeps actually planned to have poirot ride on the train and figure out the murder. it is too much of a coincidence that, he too, was involved tangentially with the armstrong case, happened to ride on the train where the revenge murder was planned to take place, and happened to ride on the same boat as mary and the doctor (where they happened to slip some clues about the plan with the ""when this is all over"" dialog)

it was actually all a setup. the armstrong peeps knew that after committing the murder on the train they would still have to face intense scrutiny and investigation and likely get caught. how to fix that? get the “world's best” detective to vouch for you.

mary and the doctor were sent to wherever poirot was (jerusalem i think) to make sure he got to the place where the train was departing from. while in his presence they slipped subtle clues about the planned murder (obviously on purpose).

Its too much a coincidence that Bouc, a big shot of the train company, happened to stumble upon poirot and was able to get him a seat on the train (after much ""haggling""). Bouc was obviously paid off (hence the prostitute). The guy that delivers the telegram about his next job was also paid off (hence poirot asking him if he was also a prostitute).

all the evidence was planted. the stunt of putting the kimono in his suitcase was to get him to take the case more personally (and to mess with his ego, more on that below). the 12 stab wounds by each passenger was to allow him to have an aha moment when he figured it all out (again an ego thing).

so why the elaborate ruse? well the reason is twofold: 

1. by having him slowly unfold the case (interviewing the suspects one by one and going through all the evidence meticulously) he lived out the horrible crime committed by casetti. he got to see, first hand, the terrible way cassetti's crime affected all of the passengers. the count and countess, for example, were a little overly dramatic when they had to sell how terribly they were affected. This got him more emotionally involved and sympathetic to their cause. during the interrogations the passengers were not forthright about revealing their connection to the armstrong case. the reason for that is 

2. they needed to play on his ego. they knew he would figure out their connection to the armstrongs eventually but they held out on purpose. they needed for him to feel like he figured it out to build his ego. he clearly demonstrates his egotistical nature when he states that he is the world's greatest detective when everyone knows he is not even in the same discussion as sherlock holmes or rick sanchez (if he ever wanted to be a detective). the kimono stunt was also a jab at his ego so that when he did figure out the case his ego would be built up that much more. poirot: ""The killer is mocking me. Good. A mistake.”

so why build his ego? the reason was so that he would feel like he is the ultimate moral arbiter on the train. you can clearly see this when, after he's figured the case, he shoos away the rail workers with a gun. this ensures that whatever decree he hands out sticks (i.e. if he decides that their act was moral and they can go free without punishment, no one would be able to question him). the last scene in the tunnel even has bliblical overtures (the last supper). it basically externalizes his ego and his belief that he is like a god handing down judgement. i think he even had a quote about god in the last scene.

at that point the armstrong peeps have achieved their first goal of having him convince himself that he can decide what is right and wrong (no small feat since initially he was adamant that there is only right and wrong and no in between, and by the end he is saying that there is a third option and in that case he can decide). but they still have yet to achieve their main goal of having him decide that what they did was justified. this was the point of the gun scene. he placed the gun on the table and asked them to kill him. he was using this to decide whether they were murderers. if they pointed the gun at him and pulled the trigger they were obviously murderers and so their act was an act of murderers. otherwise, the killing of cassetti was justified. (at least that was the delusional rationale in his head).

linda knew there would be some kind of moral test coming from him but didn't know exactly what form it would take. it just took her a moment to realize it, however, when he put the gun down. she called his bluff when she pointed the gun at her face and pulled the trigger. that level of intelligence is expected from her as she was the one who arranged the whole thing.

this convinces poirot that they are not murderers. boosted by his ego and his belief that he is the moral arbiter, he decides to set them free. it takes no effort at all for poirot to convince the police of their innocence.

so basically the whole movie was a murder mystery version of ocean's 11. the ""good"" guy (but really narcissistic and egotistical) is pwned by the ""bad"" guys (but portrayed as good guys in the movie). also, it was all a dream... inside a dream] (#spoiler)",7byfpg

dqbolso,"Saw it recently. 

I thought it was a pretty slick and stylish adaptation. It definitely has its moments. But it has its flaws too.

-Branagh's performance as Poirot was masterful. Suchet had totally nailed the character of course, so its just as well that Branagh tried something a little difference. To me, he came across as a kind of modern take on Peter Ustinov's portrayal of Poirot (the size of the moustache notwithstanding, he kinda looks like Ustinov as Poirot). All the familiar tics and attributes of the character from the book are present - albeit, portrayed just about differently enough to feel like something new. Poirot's OCD contributing to his detection skills. His being very finicky and stubborn about his likes and dislikes. His arrogance and occasional rudeness. All very much from the books, but emphasized in a whole new way.

-The other performances were great too. Depp played a very different Ratchett from the one in the original film, and its a change that proved interesting. Ridley nailed Mary Debenham. The 'Biminio Marquez' character perfectly mirrored the Antonio Foscarelli of the original. Judi Dench's Dragomiroff actually felt closer to the princess in the book than the one in the old film. Pfieffer nailed Mrs. Hubbard (she kinda reminded me of the Mrs. Hubbard character from the 2001 TV version). I LOVED Dafoe's new take on Hardman. Macqueen, Masterman, Hildegard Schmidt, Pilar Estavados (aka Greta Olsson) etc. were pretty different from the originals in various ways, but also kinda worked. The major disappointment for me was Count Andreyni. I didn't care at all for this new ballet dancer/martial artist version. The new Countess Andreyni was an interesting take, albeit not very well explored in the film.

-In terms of the plot, the film more or less crossed all the t's and dotted all the i's of Christie's original plot. And I feel it would have been better off if it stuck to that (with a few superficial changes). Because the few significant changes that HAVE been made were pretty disappointing and unnecessary. [The whole 'fight scene' between Poirot and Arbuthnot for instance. It replaced the FAR superior scene from the original film where Poirot pretends to aggressively interrogate Miss Debenham to provoke Arbuthnot, compelling both of them to come clean about their relationship.] (#spoiler) I'm not saying the new scene is bad on its own merits - it just pales in comparison to the more cerebral approach taken in the original film. Then of course there's the whole ['Macqueen stealing from Ratchett' plot - a needless red-herring which doesn't actually make sense when you think of the larger plot (Macqueen the secretary might steal from Ratchett...Macqueen, the conspirator in Ratchett's murder has absolutely no reason to do so, or even pretend to do so.)] (#spoiler). The worst part is that these scenes take away valuable time from the film which could have been used to better service the actual plot. Instead, we get Poirot's rushed deductions about some of the suspects right at the end of the film, where it comes across a little as him being psychic, rather than having actually deduced something based on evidence and reasoning.

-The cinematography and direction was outstanding. Particularly the locations (both real and CGI). I kinda liked how some of the scenes were set in the surroundings outside the train. The indoor surroundings tended to get boring after a while in the original. (That's another thing I loved about the 2001 version, which also had them wandering outside the train a little). The scenes in Istanbul and Jeruselem were great too. I loved the black-and-white flashbacks. But the one piece of shooting I didn't care much for was [the flashback to the actual murder. It seemed confused and frenzied, which I suppose was more 'realistic'...but I always loved the murder scene in the original film where they come in one by one, state their reason for killing Ratchett, and then stab him.] (#spoiler).

-And now of course, we come to the moral aspect of the ending. [It occurs to me that, while the original novel barely, if at all, touched upon the moral aspect of the story, the various adaptations have all created their own frameworks to give the story a moral theme of some sort. In the original '74 film, it was the idea of Ratchett being put on 'trial' by 'twelve' conspirators. In the Suchet version, they leaned heavily into Poirot's Catholicism and how it influences his perception of right and wrong. Here the emphasis was also on Poirot's perception of right and wrong, albeit from a less religious perspective, and more from a point of view of 'perfection', and whether it can ever be achieved when it comes to justice.] (#spoiler) Personally, I found this film's handling of Poirot's feelings about the decision he had to make a welcome middle-ground between the original film's cavalier attitude towards the ending and the overly angst-ridden interpretation in the Suchet episode. I particularly liked [the 'test of character' Poirot administered on the suspects in the end...as predictable as it was. It shows that he did base his final decision on some due consideration on the moral complexities of the case.] (#spoiler)

-Two smaller peeves that didn't ruin the film for me but just bugged me. One was [Poirot's lover in the photograph, who didn't at all exist in the books, and had zero relevance to the plot.] (#spoiler) The other was [Poirot having been in touch with Colonel Armstrong before the latter's death. Yes, the payoff with Poirot writing the letter replying to the Colonel in the end was suitably poetic - but if you really examine this subplot, it just seems to come out of nowhere (which is true enough). Isn't it *too* much of a coincidence that the detective the group avenging Daisy Armstrong comes up against is the same one who her father tried to hire years earlier?] (#spoiler)

On the whole, a decent enough adaptation that certainly kept me entertained...even had a bit of a wow factor for me. But certainly not among the greatest of Christie adaptations.",7byfpg

dpq9ckr,"Pretty good. I'd give it an 8/10.

Two absolutely unnecessary action scenes are added. They don't hurt the story overall but they feel like something that somebody thought they HAD to have or the audience would get bored so they forced them in.

There are a couple other changes to the story that either don't hurt it or actually end up benefiting it:

- The change from a blizzard to an avalanche isn't much different and it allows for the characters to go outside instead of just spending the whole movie on the train.

- Dr. Constantine is excluded from the movie but his character and role are split between a couple other characters so nothing is lost there.

I know some people are saying they wished the characters were more fleshed out, but I think that would've made the movie too long and too slow.

If there was some driving force or, I hate to say it, a ticking clock the story would have some more momentum and a reason.

Really added another layer to everything.

This was some top tier Pfiefer, I wouldn't be surprised if she picked up a supporting nom for this. I'm glad this movie was so good because I'd love more like it. Even though this isn't the best movie I've seen this year I love that it felt different from others in its price range.

I liked the main character's struggle with justice/right and wrong but overall I felt mostly everyone was underdeveloped.

I felt a good amount of ""agatha you *sneak*"" but it didn't feel that conclusive in a way for the movie? I really liked that very last shot with the train and car, though. Idk the book was probably better and I think I may have to read it, my mystery loving mother probably has a copy.

I remember liking a lot of camera angles, like that one long overhead view in the hallway after a murder but they never panned *up to the thing* it was only shown at that angle in a few shots later which seemed so ""???"". Or at least that's what I think happened.

I still may watch it again sometime, though. Murder mysteries are at their best when you can reread/rewatch and pick up on on the clever foreshadowing the second time through, and I love the detective fiction genre and have been meaning to get more into it.",7byfpg

dq98c7a,"Just got back from seeing this. Loved every minute of it. The cast were all amazing (although a lot, I felt, were underused such as Judi Dench and Olivia Colman.) Kenneth Branagh really pleasantly surprised me as Poirot. I had my doubts before seeing the movie and was convinced that nobody would ever be as good as David Sucet but he was really good. Quite funny in places and he had Poirot's charm and proudness down. Was quite impressed with Johnny Depp. He seemed to actually act and be quite good (even if I wasn't really sure what he was saying at times.) Really impressed with Josh Gad. I've only seen him in comedic/kids stuff like Beauty and the Beast and Pixels and i know Reddit likes to hate on him but he has some very good drama chops and can be quite intense. I was blown away by Michelle Phieffer especially in the tunnel scene. She was fantastic.

The cinematography was really good. Absolutely gorgeous and really sold the lavish feel of the movie. The camera angles used were really interesting. Especially the camera pointing down and at the backs of Poirot and Bouc when they discover the victim. 

It was a bit slow in the middle but the twist and the scenes leading up to it were really gripping and thrilling.

dpoxupf,"Did not hate it. But disappointed, as was my mother who I took because she’s a massive fan of the Author and book.

Not once do you feel any sense of thrill or mystery trying to put the puzzle pieces together. The whole film is basically the detective going from train car to train car interviewing people without anything of much significance happening. A who done it movie should be fun and keep the audience guessing and on their toes. 

The characters were also surprisingly bland and underdeveloped for such a classic story and great cast. 

This is one of those movies I don’t regret watching, but at the same time I’ll never watch it again. There’s no clues to go back and look for and the film just isn’t engaging or exciting on any level once you know what happened. 
",7byfpg
dplwt6v,"I didn't think it was bad. However, I was underwhelmed. I've never read the book but I saw the trailers and the idea intrigued me. It seemed like it had potential to be a suspenseful, thrilling mystery. I did find myself intrigued by the mystery, but never felt any suspense really. I think this movie would be better if there was some sense of urgency to solve the crime or some kind of time clock. 

I also found it hard to care about these characters. I realize it is hard to develop 12 characters or however many suspects there were. However, when the big reveal was made it didn't really have an impact on me because I didn't really understand these people and their perspective. In fact, I felt quite unsatisfied that they didn't go to jail. I know they killed a bad man but they still murdered someone.

The other thing, and this is probably more due to the source material, but I don't really think I liked the twist. It felt contrived and convoluted. Why would they all cram into a small room next to the best detective to kill this guy? It is certainly not a logical or efficient way to kill the guy. Unpredictability can be good if executed well and done in a way that actually makes sense in retrospect.

It also was quite slow in parts. I still thought the idea was good and the mystery did keep me guessing and intrigued. The cast did a good job and the movie was pretty to look at. So I would give it a 6/10. Not terrible, but not great",7byfpg
dplw7u2,"This was my movie of the year. I can't remember the last time I had a smile on my face start to finish. This is a detective fan's movie. But honestly, even if you aren't a fan of detective fiction, you need to see this, **because you won't see another movie like this made.** This is something out of another era. The style, the tropes, the archetypes—they don't exist in modern fiction, or at least not modern cinema. The denouement where the detective gathered the suspects and laid out how the crime was committed was so perfect, I almost teared up.

I will say I understand why some critics didn't like it. The movie was so faithful to the book that it adapted things that work better in book form than film form. For instance, not bringing up the Armstrong case until midway through the film is an odd narrative choice that works better in print than it does in a two-hour motion picture. I think the movie would have worked better if it had opened with some sort of reference to it, either to the letter Poirot received or else a flashback to the crime itself. I also don't think the movie paid enough attention to spacial reasoning, showing where each passenger's cabin was in relation to the crime scene. But as that really wasn't how he solved the crime, it may have been seen as extraneous.",7byfpg
dpnkkto,"Just watched it, it was alright. Everyone acted (not literally but their prescribed actions) way too suspiciously which led me to think of the eventual conclusion earlier than I was meant to. It was a welcome surprise sort of, mainly because self doubt constantly pushes it away from reality, but not the best climax. All the interrogation was great though, and oh my gosh that fucking moustache. Also, in the scene where Mary is accused and Arbuthnot shoots Poirot, weren’t him and Mary sitting on the edge of a drop that Mary just walks off? Or am I not remembering correctly? 

I’d give the movie 7ish overall. Accents made it a bit hard to understand some stuff and the climax was made a bit obvious, but the build up to it was good. Some form of drive for the whole thing would have been great though, and I think the thing towards the end with the gun was poorly executed. ",7byfpg
dq2qf4j,"It did not blow my mind, but it was at the least a good watch.

The problem I noticed is that the movie is about watching the main character solve the case without properly inviting audience to solve it together, which I assume the book did better (I didn't read it). I heard a lot about the book, so I was still satisfied by just finally watching the story, but because it was impossible for anyone to figure anything out from the speed of which important information is revealed it was like a puzzle that was hard to solve in a wrong way",7byfpg
dqcdefh,"My family wanted to see something over the vacation and it came down between this and Roman J. Israel Esq.. I wanted to see both, but went with this as I had heard better things than Roman and looked like something the family could enjoy more as a whole.

I had never read or seen any of the other adapatations before so the story was new to me and I have to say I did not see the twist coming and was really surprised by how dark it ended. Great performances and the cinematograpgy as goregeous! It had a real classic Hollywood feel to it that's really rare to see in movies nowadays. 

It wasn't without it's flaws though. There were some issues with the tone and it did drag and slow down a bit in the middle, but not quite to the degree that I think some people have been saying. I would've liked to see some more development and screentime with the other characters as well.

dpqu7cj,"It was very good, I’ve read the book and seen the original many times so it wasn’t about the whodunit for me, I was just observing the movie and experiencing it for what it was. The acting was amazing, as was expected. Sometimes the lighting outside was a little warm and soft which gave a lot of the environments a fake feel, along with the fact that when they were outside in the snow there wasn’t snow in their faces or hair or any real signs of being cold which made it feel like they were just in front of a green screen which they probably were but I would’ve liked more effort in making it feel real. For a movie where most of the people watching it probably know the ending, these things are crucial for it to just be an art piece and I mean for the rest of the movie it was amazing and I didn’t hate the soft lighting outside, it did give it a cinematic feel which I think they were going for. The camera angles were strange sometimes but just because they were strange doesn’t mean they were bad at all, they were actually quite extraordinary and only ever added to the movie and I think they were pretty perfect, albeit a little unconventional. 

Overall an enjoyable experience; this story is always great to experience. Kenneth’s take as Poirot was very good, but of course it is because he is a fantastic actor and I want to see another rendition of a different adventure with him as the character.",7byfpg

I get that we need to establish who they each are and their significance, but I found the manner mediocre. The ending was anticlimactic in my opinion.

1. How come Poirot never bothers interrogating Bouc (the man who owns the train)? He is present during all of Poirot's interrogations and I believed he was the murderer.

2. Whose spot on the train did Poirot take? Was there supposed to be an additional passenger at all or was there supposed to be somebody else involved in the murder? ",7byfpg

dpxbsm1,"Unrelated to the film itself, aside from the screening of which being the setting of the story, I had an interesting audience encounter during a trip to the theater to see Murder on the Orient Express last weekend.

During the pre-trailer, ""coming to network TV this fall"" type fare, a gentleman came in and asked my girlfriend and I ""Does anyone know why this whole row of empty seats was unavailable to buy?"". Not feeling as though I needed to articulate the way most theaters work regarding assigned seating and buying tickets online ahead of time and how, in all likelihood, those people bought good seats ahead of time and are now free to show up whenever they like without worrying about getting a good seat, I just said ""I guess they're not here yet?"" and continued chatting with my girlfriend as the man sat next to me.

As the lights lowered for the trailers, the man leaned over toward me and said ""Don't be offended if I get up and go down to a better seat when the movie starts"", to which I responded with a thumbs up as if to demonstrate I understood, but didn't really care what he did or didn't do as a complete stranger I happened to be sitting near at a movie.

So...before the murder even took place, this man who had initially seemed very concerned with his theater going experience fell asleep. Now, as I typically don't make an effort to look around and check the attentiveness of the people who are attending the same screening as I am, I usually don't notice or care if someone falls asleep during a movie. The only reason I was aware the guy was asleep is, being the person sitting closest to him I was the first to hear the snoring. After the first audible snore, I squeezed my girlfriends hand and turned toward her with wide-eyes and a a pursed smirk, which she responded to with bewilderment until the following snore which was loud enough for her to hear and caused her confused stare to mimic my surprised expression.

I whispered ""What do I do?"" as the mans snores grew louder and louder, all the while I could see past her every person on our row had begun to lean forward in their seats in our direction at the surprisingly loud snoring. I'm talking about a level of snoring that would lead a loved one to insist you see a doctor, the entire theater could hear the snoring, as evidenced by the growing murmuring and giggling of the audience members. I could suddenly see people in the row in front of us sitting up in their seats to turn around and see who was making this cartoonishly loud snoring.

When it became clear that, to my surprise, the sound of his own snoring wasn't going to wake him up, I realized this was my responsibility to take care of as the person seated closest to him. Not being a big fan of touching people I don't know, especially when they're sleeping, I thought to myself ""I'll just clear my throat and he'll wake up, right?"", but rather than pulling off a gentle but firm, traditional throat-clearing ""Uhm-huh"" I'd intended, I released a single, loud ""UH"" as if being punched in the gut which startled the man mid-snore causing an even louder final snarled snore, which in turn made the entire theater burst out laughing.

Twenty or thirty minutes later, the man stood up and left. I felt really bad, I'd intended to save him from the embarrassment of interrupting a movie by loudly snoring, only to inadvertently make a show of his snoring that led to an entire theater laughing at him and likely even more embarrassment. If the snoring man is out there, I'm sorry. I hope that you left because you were either tired or uninterested in the movie and not because everyone laughed at you.",7byfpg
dpxpg2s,"I guess this is more a grievance with the book but I wasn't a fan of the whole ""everyone did it"" ending. You go in to the movie trying to guess who did it and it turns out that it doesn't matter who you guess because it was everyone. I mean, it did catch me by surprise so I guess it wasn't all bad, I just thought it wasn't a very satisfying ending, especially since Poirot just kind of goes ""Oh well, I guess murder is okay sometimes"". ",7byfpg
dpm4q4r,"I quite liked it. Decent adaptation.

1. I persuaded my girlfriend to come and see it with me because it had Johnny Depp in it. Hahaha! I felt a little bad knowing the story. But at least he was in flashbacks a fair amount.
2. Here in the UK, almost every Poirot story was adapted with David Suchet as Poirot, and he is so absolutely *the* embodiment of Poirot in everyone's minds, that people thought it brave that anyone should try to portray him. Huge credit to Brannagh for trying something slightly different with the character and completely succeeding with it. Perhaps the best thing about the film.
3. The various characters felt a little like cartoon characters, which ties in perfectly with the trailer and marketing presenting them as the archetypes they really are: ""The professor"", ""The Princess"", ""The Maid"" etc. Honestly I thought this was a very good move, and the comedy with Poirot needing everything to be perfect also worked well. Too ""authentic"" and dour a film wouldn't have worked honestly. As Mark Kermode said in [his review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce_atyNhdmM) (I incidentally agree with him in everything he says) he whole thing felt like a live game of Cluedo, right down the the *superb* overhead shots.
4. In fact I think he did extremely well filming inside the train carriage, it must have been a nightmare but it looked great and never felt cramped. Also, like Kermode, I wasn't quite as taken with the moments outside the train in the snow.
5. The CGI of old Turkey etc. was just ok, not great but not bad.
6. The opening scene - none of which was in the book at all - was a superb addition and worked perfectly. Set up Brannagh's Poirot very well. I *love* the gag with the eggs. Again, something new and not from the books.

There were a few things I would have changed, I wouldn't have turned the boisterous and gesticulating Italian into the far more boring hispanic spiv (great shame, that), Michelle Pfeiffer wasn't nearly brash, brassy, and outrageous enough (the character is meant to be Kathy Bates on Titanic).

First and foremost, this film could have worked fine without a lot of the camerawork, but having some unique shots in a genre that doesn’t necessarily require them made it that much better. It was one of the first films I’ve seen in a while that I noted the camerawork where I wasn’t actually expecting there to be great shots going in. Adding in those extra touches made it that much better. 

The other big item was the attention to detail for each of the characters. Each had their own quirks and moments that you could easily miss, while still being relevant to the story. I particularly liked the portrayal of Poirot’s obsession with balance, even down to him reading “A Tale of Two Cities”, whose famous opening stanza tells of two equal, but opposite ends of the spectrum. (“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...”)

Overall, I liked it a lot. There were a couple of moments I felt were a little off, and the “big reveal” kind of just... happened. But it was better than I expected and was pleasantly surprised with the entire movie.

dpm0507,"Where do I even begin with this movie. 

I don't normally type out comments about movies, much less on reddit, but I feel like I need to express myself. 

This movie is dull, not like, your father is watching an old western on the couch and you decided to sit down for 30 minutes and try and engage yourself in between the Viagra commercials dull, but somehow worse, because you're sitting in a theater wondering what the fuck happened with the budget. 

Every single character aside from Hercule is paper thin, i realize this is a contingency on the running time, but for fuck sake, this is Hollywood, i feel like we can cut the traveler numbers in half and develop someone worth watching, especially with this level of starpower. How the hell do you make Judi Dench into a literal crusty old bat who's largest character trait is her dog. The black character is essentially ""the black character"".

During the opening sequence in Istanbul, you're going to be greeted with what i can only describe as low-polygon CGI in between nonstop bouts of in your face exposition. The main character is the smartest and greatest person in the world at what he does, and the plot falls into his lap in the way that only an episode of house could rival. 

As far as the plot goes, you won't get your twist, you won't get that feeling that you're looking for when you walk into a mystery. There is no point in playing along, thus, there is no point to get invested into the plot, which rivals the side characters in terms of how little depth it's working with. 


The one good thing I can say about this movie from the get go and throughout is that whoever designed the costumes and some set pieces know's what they're doing. I wanted to become engrossed in the setting, but its a pretty picture at times with nothing else going on.

dpx0bk5,"I read the book and watched the David Suchet version from the tv series, so I definitely didn't walk in blind, and I honestly don't know how I would've felt about this movie had I known nothing about it.

First of all, I think Branagh's portrayal wasn't so bad. Sure he missed some essential key Poirot features described in the book - he's too tall, rather skinny, and oh my god where's the egg shaped head - but certain mannerisms and movements he makes are reminiscent of Suchet's portrayal itself. The way he moves his hands in a soft rotating kind of way as he speaks, even the way he becomes enraged at the end, battling the conflict between right and wrong. Even the little reference to the fact that Poirot can only eat his hard boiled eggs if they are exactly the same size was a nice gesture towards those that are more familiar with the role. Nonetheless, there were many things that were off-putting with his portrayal. Poirot wasn't funny or in-your-face smug. He just knew he was good, but he doesn't have to tell you because you know that already.

As for everything else, bleh. Suddenly Poirot is a crime fighting super hero who uses his cane to do awesome tricks and kick the bad guy's butt! Uh no. The very blatant Hollywood style attempt to appeal to the masses put me off very much. This all started with using an Imagine Dragon song with the trailer, then we find out the plot is suffocating with too-familiar faces (Johnny Depp I love you but *sigh*). And finally we get cheap action tricks that are non-existent in the book. Really, the book is such a somber deal that the forced drama was just shocking to see and I rolled my eyes far to many times than usual that day. 

SPOILER The only thing I liked, albeit a bit forced, was when Poirot demands that somebody shoots him in order to stop him from going to the police. The point of this was for him to determine whether the killer was also a murderer - which is a distinction only made so explicit in The Murder on the Orient Express. When Linda attempts to shoot herself, Poirot establishes that Linda is not a murderer, but a soul in turmoil which ""died with Daisy"". This scene, although not in the book, parallels Poirot's inner turmoil which was not explicitly revealed in the movie. 

And in fact, there was much that was left out, including much emotion that was not present in this adaptation. The supporting act was lifeless and dull and I cared for none of them. It is a poor comparison to the sheer emotion and confused empathy the reader/ viewer feels reading the book or watching the series. And all this is achieved without the effects, action and cheap attempts to shock.

dpo5fkc,"I saw it last night and I was underwhelmed.  The cinematography was great, and easily the best part of the movie - it was absolutely gorgeous to watch.  But the rest was blah (and I am a huge Christie fan).  The middle really dragged, there was no space to figure out any of the clues - or even any real attempt to.  The grease spot on the passport is a big clue in the book, but Poirot ""solves"" it almost immediately after it is introduced in the movie.  The red dragon kimono is a non-starter as a clue - the movie does virtually nothing with it.  

The extras they added don't work either - Poirot is shot and Mrs. Hubbard is stabbed, but neither adds anything to the story and it is almost laughable how neither of them seems to feel any lasting effects of the injuries.

This is probably just me, but I also hated the little nod they did at the end to ""Death on the Nile.""  If you aren't a Christie fan, you aren't going to catch it and it violates something else in the movie (Poirot had to immediately return to London for another case).  If you are ARE a Christie fan, it doesn't make sense either.  ""Death on the Nile"" has virtually the same set-up as Orient Express - Poirot is on vacation, and a murder happens on a boat in the middle of his trip - he doesn't show up after the murder has occurred.  So what was the point of that?  Either you don't get it or you do and it doesn't make sense?

The film spent too much time making bad jokes and introducing characters and not enough unravelling the mystery aboard the train. Important clues and sections of the story were overlooked and the ""action""  scenes felt shoehorned.

Perhaps the abundance of characters was a problem... perhaps the fact that I knew the ending beforehand didn't help... 
It's one of those where I'm sitting on the fence with my overall impressions... ultimately not liking it enough to recommend to others.

Wouldn’t the killers have only expected to have the crime scene studied, the clues analyzed, wouldn’t they have only expected to have to give their stories after the fact when the train arrived at the next station.

The trailer almost looked like it was trying to turn it into an action movie in places. I won't even mind if they change certain events, but I don't want to see it if they've changed the atmosphere.

Random thoughts:

- I haven't read the source material, so I can't really contrast the two, and I don't really want to get bogged down in making plot criticisms that might just be part of the signature. This is honestly my first introduction to this stuff outside of, I think, that one Dr. Who episode? I will say that I thought the opening bit, while neat was a bit hokey with the cane bit. The ending felt a little un-cinematic to me, mostly because I didn't feel like I had a strong grasp on Poirot's morality to know if that was the one time he let the murderers go, or if he's normally sympathetic to killers with a sob story.

- The trailer kind of gave it away that Depp was going to get killed, not exactly a huge problem but it does take a little of the wind out of it's sails for the mystery part.

- I didn't really have any issues with any of the acting, although Branagh was a bit hard to understand on occasion.

- I like that he was playing around with the camera rather early on when the crash and investigation started was interesting, but then he just kind of stopped and that was a bit of a weird shift. The ceiling camera gave the scene a pretty solid feeling for the size of the room.

- My only real complaint is that the whole thing felt rushed. The audience was never given time to breathe really, it's just one interview after another after another, and I feel like someone else behind the camera might have been able to give the various twists and turns a bit more build up and impact to them. With this it just kind of felt like I was along for the ride and just letting everything go by without really getting absorbed into it.",7byfpg

dq6iojw,"It was better than I expected it to be from the trailers. The acting was great, as was the story and characters. I loved the way the film developed things introduced in the beginning, both stylistically (the use of black and white flashbacks) and thematically (Hercules' moral code). 

My main problems with it revolved around how it was plotted. First of all, the reveals towards the end felt incredibly anticlimactic. When he confronted the red haired lady after everyone was evacuated to the tunnel, he accused her of being the killer out of nowhere. Her being the killer already felt anticlimactic because it was so obvious based on her refusing to answer his questions, but my main problem was that the clues and logical steps that Hercules had to take to come to this conclusion weren't shown to the audience. There was no way we could have figured that out on our own. He worked through the logic offscreen and because of that his accusation where he lists all the things she might have done feels like a complete let down.

Of course she's not the (only) killer, everyone is. Which leads to my other problem. We learn the conducter was in on it the entire time, and that he alerted everyone to come kill the guy. My problem is that, earlier in the film, he says he would've seen someone moving through the corridor but didn't. Now, as a film, and a mystery film at that, I feel like this is presented to us as a fact. Yes, he could be lying, but in order to build the most suspense the movie is using that line as a way to confound the mystery. Now not only do we have to figure out who killed a man, but we have to figure out who could do it under such bizarre circumstances. That makes the mystery more exciting, so even though the conductor could just be lying, it would make for a better film if he isn't.

But then at the end we learn he was lying. And, in fact, all of the obstacles presented throughout the film were fake. The kimono, the button, the lack of passengers in the corridor, the barbitol, none of it ever mattered. I think that *really* hampers the film because all of the questions we've been presented throughout end up being completely pointless. So some first third of the film was a complete waste of time.

I don't know, these are just my thoughts. They aren't necessarily problems with this version in particular, more just the story being told. It's not as effective as I would expect from how famous Agatha Christie is for murder mysteries.",7byfpg

The detectives only real motive to solve the case was “ if you don’t solve it your friend will be in trouble, and the police suck where were going”.

dpsens9,"Prior to this film I saw the Albert Finney version and the David Suchet version. To me this is the weakest of the three.

Moving a lot of the action outside the train took away from the tension and claustrophobia of the previous versions. [The Count’s introduction of him beating up several reporters, (even roundhouse kicking one of them), was simply absurd.](#spoiler)

I also felt that some of the cast members, such as Judi Dench, Olivia Colman and Penelope Cruz were underused, considering their formidable acting abilities. On the other hand, Josh Gad and Daisy Ridley were standouts in the film.

Branagh himself was a serviceable Poirot, and I liked his introduction. But he didn’t quite hit the mark the way Suchet and Finney have. It didn’t help that his moustache was simply too exaggerated.

- Good cinematography 
- Mostly good acting (Except Johnny Depp - Is he ok?? and Sergei Polunin - great great dancer, youtube him, it is mesmerising. But no actor sadly.)
- Branagh was definitely ok as Poirot, he has that twinkle in his eyes I imagine the character has :}. 
- I love the new version of the moustache mask, but why oh whyyyy did he not have it on the night of the murder? That scene was made very slapsticky IMO and his moustache mask would added so much to that. Also it is very very inconsistent for the character to not wear it. In every book his pride and care for his moustache is mentioned :p
- So little time we get to know the details of the characters, this didn’t feel so in the other version. It made it very difficult for people to puzzle out the solution and to bond with the characters. And I think the too ahort scenes made it more of a drone and therefore more boring as you did not have time to invest. 
- I loved the decor and clothing. 
- I did like the mini intro case in Jerusalem. 
- What was that with the overly dramatic hunkering for his old sweetheart? I can’t remember him ever been luvvy duvvy in the books (I didn’t read all 88 stories). And have never missed that side.. It also added nothing to the story. 
- I found it so ironic that at the end he mentions the crooked tie while his tie was crooked as well. And more times his clothing was not that crisp. 
- There were so many weird little inconsistencies or unnatural behaviours by the characters. Example, the shooting and just scratching Poirot. If you can shoot that precise why actually hurt Poirot? Why take that risk at all? And was it necessary? Could he not jus confess, there was no immediate hurry as they were still stuck at the time. 
- I didn’t like that they were able to go outside, I liked the tension of the claustrophobia. 
- It is also very weird to interview daisy/mary outside in that icy weather. Having tea and not actually taking the time to drink it, I would have blue frozen lips.. And the bad lipstick application that moved in between shots was very distracting. (Sorry I am verrrry overly detail oriented and also a make up/visage fan.)
- And the second (half)outside scene with daisy/mary was also weird. Not only two seconds before they were instructed to stay outside the train, why were they able to be there as well as Dr. Arbuthnot? How did he get there without Poirot and the train crew seeing him. Such lazy writing. 

I could go on but I assume most readers made it this far, haahah. 

My finishing thought I am disappointed, I love love love Poirot, Agatha Christie and Kenneth Branagh as an actor and director. But I think this one missed many marks. 

Greets to all movielovers


",7byfpg
dq86kpu,"I just saw this and I am so disappointed. It was one of those movies that are **completely different** from what the trailer made it out to be. 

It had so much potential, but I felt the pacing was all wrong; there was too much focus on irrelevant side plots and it took too long to build up to the climax. In fact, there was almost **no point** to that first 15-30 minutes of the film. I understand that first few scenes was trying to establish the two main characters. In particular, that Hercule was ""the greatest detective alive"" and Ratchett was ""the bad greedy gangster"". The acting itself was good, but I disliked how the main villain and protagonist were portrayed in such one-dimensional way.

Same goes for the introduction of a lewd womanizer director and the star-crossed couple. **NONE of these characters** really needed to be introduced to the audience at this point. I think it would've made a more compelling plot, if all of the suspects starting being introduced to the audience after the murder, and it would make a more exciting build up as we get to know each character's motives. 

I understand the plot is based on the book, but they could've taken the liberty of shortening the parts that are not important. Especially considering how this is supposed to be a mystery/thriller, slow paced first half did not work well. 

The movie did pick up in the latter half, but the ending was a COMPLETE contradiction to what was established. The ENTIRE film had depicted our hero as a black-and-white logical perfectionist, then SUDDENLY he realizes there was more to justice than right or wrong the last 3 minutes of the film. IF this trait was to change, I would've liked to see him to go through **some sort of emotional character development** which forces him to come to this conclusion. (what was the deal about the dead wife/gf Katherine? *more irrelevant plots*) Instead, he just magically decided he, for the first time ever in his life, does not care about bringing the real murderer to justice. Because guess what? The man who was murdered was ""a bad guy"" who made everyone suffer emotionally. [Why were we not given Rachett's motive for kidnap? I thought *surely* the ending was going to be that: Rachett's kidnap was *somehow* justified and murderers realize how justice is not black-and-white after all](#spoiler).

I'm not going to get into them, but the biggest thing for me was that Branagh overlooked the consequences of his plot changes. [The gun fight ruined the concept of Poirot telling the police the alternate theory of the murder. In the book, he did this because he realized that their intentions were noble and Ratchett was evil, etc., but to me, having one of them try to KILL Poirot ruins that logic.

The only Agatha Christie I've ever read was *And Then There Were None*, so I went in to the movie blind to the plot and to Poirot. I really liked the opening scenes in Jerusalem for how they set up the character efficiently and affectionately. I think the movie tried to do the same to a lesser degree for the supporting characters, which had uneven results, but that's to be expected when you have an ensemble of murder suspects [who are all lying through their teeth](#spoiler). 

The camerawork was neat as well; I liked how frequently the camera moved along the boundaries of the train to reinforce the claustrophobia of it all-- the overhead shots as the murder is first discovered, the tracking shots along the hallway, etc.

dqj5l7e,"I gave it a 3/10 in the poll. 

Only plus points were the half decent visuals in some spots. 

The negatives are lengthy: 

The beginning section was trying to be funny and ""quirky"" (god i hate that word). Quirky seems to be the right word to describe a type of humour which isn't funny but because it's off the wall, unconventional and a bit weird it's meant to get laughs. I think it's a good short hand for the uncreative to give the illusion of being humerous without actually being so. It's becoming a pattern on British television as well. Television presenters and sports journalists are guilty of talking to much and trying to be funny but just come off as self absorbed and boring. The worst example of this so called humour is Doctor Who. I managed to watch maybe 25 minutes of the Christmas Special several years ago when Matt Smith was the Doctor. It was a cringe fest. 

I think in the search of being ""original"" or ""creative"" people have gone back to areas where clearly unhumerous things are discarded. They've picked up on this and in an age where mindless ""subversion"" is applauded they run with it  thinking they're virtuous for their act of rebellion. In reality, it's not the 1970s anymore. They run the show. This type of humour now makes it into Hollywood blockbusters with a cast of stars. Their ""subversion"" is nothing of the sort. 

There is also another thing which annoys me in the beginning. The part where he places his stick into the Wailing Wall about 10 minutes before the man runs into it. Apart from being completely unlikely, a police officer can't see a stick jutting out in broad day light? (Oh and he can run through the same grasping crowd twice?!) - how is Poirot meant to know he was going to run there? He's a genius detective, he's not a God. 



Another thing which struck me were the number of clearly politically charged ""social issues"" clumsily shoe horned into the film. For example that laboured point of mixing red and white wine together. It was clearly an allusion to mixed race relationships but it was done in a lecturing, authoritarian style. I would like to have seen the professor humiliated for his remark a bit more subtly and intelligently. Especially when this is a carriage full of people who at least move through high parts of society. I felt like this was overwrought and I suspect Branagh thinks that the general public are a mass of ugly, stupid Brexit trolls who find mixed race relationships to be foul. Again, this isn't the 1970s. If you want another clumsy example, remember when McQueen suggests it could be Ramirez? From the lawyer trained, reasonably clever jack of all trades accountant in one scene to a loutish drunk bigot the next; Branagh may as well just have gotten him to say: ""OI M8 IT WAS THAT FARKIN' BROWN GUY WEREN'T IT"". 

Anyway, lets get to the story. I don't have as many complaints as before. I just found it a bit dull. The characters were not very interesting, the dialogue they had was quite limited in how they could express themselves. The plot was bled out at a fairly quick pace and it wasn't long before you could make some safe assumptions, after learning of one or two connections among the passengers to the tragedy of the Armstrong family you could call what was going to happen next. When they examined the body and revealed the strange number of irregular types of cut into the flesh of Depp I thought to myself it could have been more than one person doing it. Didn't assume it was the entire carriage at that point though! 

I can see the good parts of the story but i don't think it was told well. I wasn't drawn into it and compelled by the mission of the film. The back stories were formulaic end and failed to arouse much feeling of sympathy into the viewer. I never felt that ""creepy"" feeling of having a murderer on board a train which can't be left. There should be a little sense of dread or horror to be in that situation.

Other than that, I loved the characters, I loved the mystery for the most part (could have had a bit more meat on its bones and other aspects could have been fleshed out more) and the movie did seem to rush to the climax, like I was watching and all the sudden realized the movie was coming to an end and revelations were starting and it caught me a little off guard.

dpn5dct,"I gotta say, I wasn't a big fan. I like whodunits because I can try to pick up clues and solve the mystery along with the protagonist, but this film doesn't really allow for that because the breakthroughs come not from putting together existing clues in different ways, but from arbitrarily introducing completely new information to the plot. I found it difficult to engage with the film. The ending also feels empty because it doesn't earn the right to blow my mind. [For instance, Poirot finds his ideas of morality challenged when he discovers that each murderer had suffered enormously at the hands of the murder victim, and so he declares that nobody is a killer. But the film spent no time leading up to that point challenging his existing views on balance, morality, etc., so for him to be so suddenly changed feels cheap and fake. The same goes for the emotional payoff of revealing each murderer's backstory--I can see that I'm supposed to feel for them and understand their motivations, but there are so many characters for me to keep track of that I wasn't given the time to bond with any of them.](#spoiler)

Overall, the film felt unfocused, like it tried to cover too much. But with less than two hours of screentime, if you're going to adapt from written source material, you have to make decisions on condensing the narrative down so that you can tell a tightly focused story. [The little mini-mystery in the beginning, for example, was completely unnecessary.](#spoiler) And because it's unable to keep focus, the film fails to earn its ending.",7byfpg

dq2w6va,"I personally really enjoyed it. That being said, I haven't seen the movie from the 70s, and I hear a lot of people say that it doesn't compare. I wondered why the reviews were all pretty negative going in, and I still couldn't figure out why when I finished it either (I didn't look at the criticisms beforehand so my judgement wouldn't be impaired). I'm a big fan of crime dramas, and *Murder* kept me guessing the whole time, which is what I always love in a mystery. I would say that it is pretty slow at revealing information at times, and that I wish it went a bit faster. Chris Stuckmann said that the pacing was kinda off in some places, and I do agree with that criticism. At first the ending caught me off guard and I didn't particularly enjoy it (the scene when the killer is revealed). But after really thinking about it, it made a lot of sense in the end. This movie also looks good...as long as it doesn't contain any CGI, that was pretty poor (but I won't count that against the movie because that wasn't what it was going for, but I'd figure that I'd bring it up).

But let's talk some spoilers 
[For the first 30 minutes, I was for certain that the killer was Detective Poirot. I thought this because in the opening shots, it was very clear that he liked everything to be perfect (or close to perfect, demonstrated with the eggs). And so when Racthett died, I thought Poirot was the one who did it. Taking care of an otherwise almost perfect community on the train. Which, I couldn't have been more wrong. Turns out it was everyone, which I was not expecting. I actually dismissed this idea before the climax when the killlers were revealed. Everyone was beginning to come clean, and it was very clear that everyone was involved with a murder that Ratchett had committed many moons ago. I didn't put all of the pieces together that everyone would have been in on it, and chalked it up to there being a more metaphorical answer as to why everyone on the train was affected by the brutal murder Ratchett had committed. I do with Ratchett was given some more character other than ""he's a terrible person for committing this terrible act"". But I also want to talk about some of the imagery in the killer-reveal scene. There was one shot in particular that showed all of the passengers sitting at a table (due to the train being caught in the snow). The shot was a recreation of The Last Supper, which may have been easy to miss because it was quite short. But I also found some ties to the scene of the Last Supper from the Bible with Hubbard turning out to be the mother of the child killed by Ratchett, and how she was willing to kill herself, but Poirot had emptied the gun, showing that he already made up his mind. And how that all relates to the confrontation with Judas and Jesus during the Last Supper. But moving on from that climax, I also saw a connection from the first shot and last shot of Poirot on the train. The first shot of Poirot entering the train had the camera on the outside of the train following him from the end to the front. And the last shot of Poirot on the train was with the camera on the interior following him as he walked from the front of the train to the end. Showing that in the opening, showing that his moral compass is off, and that his perception of reality is not correct. And when he is leaving the train, with the camera following him, he's come to the realization that right and wrong is not real. There is a gray area between black and white. Anyways, those are things that I found to be interesting in the end](#spoiler)

Overall, I'd give it al 8/10. It's a solid film.",7byfpg

dppbmlz,"Brilliant film.  Wonderful take on the Poirot series.  Kenneth was fanastic as Poirot, I was concerned as I thought I'd be imaging Suchet throughout, but it wasn't the case.  Kenneth Branagh did a fantastic job and really took ownership of the role; it was funny, and cliched, and, well, perfect.

Great cast.  They all look pretty much as I imagined they would look when I first read the book.  The costumes, the personas...I thought they were awesome.  Gwyneth doing a great job of being a good actress being a bad actress, Dench being confused yet commanding, Depp being the obvious suspect until......!!  Brilliant.

The mystery is a perfect game of Cluedo - all the suspects boxed in together, a detective, the clues.  I felt like another character because we were all so enclosed together.

The writing was fantastic, I laughed out loud a couple of times.  The egg thing and the fudge line and Poirot's moustache face-guard for sleeping!!!....so funny.  The final ""reveal"" when all the suspects are sat together behind the table at the entrance of the tunnel is just superb.

The scenery is stunning.  You feel the might of the train and the overwhelming magnificence of the surroundings.  They clearly went all over the world to get the shots and it really shows.  There are a couple of obvious CGI moments but it's barely noticeable and doesn't take anything away from what they're trying to show you - and yet the main ""show"" is obviously inside the train and the outside is barely important really, yet without the outside, the inside wouldn't be half as captivating and claustrophobic. 

If you know Agatha Christie, and know the format....if you know the David Suchet series even, you'll love this.  It's everything *Poirot* should be.  And set up nicely for a sequel.  Can't wait.

Agatha would be pleased.  I'm sure of it. ",7byfpg

Through the beginning of the movie, I thought it was alright, but not great, but it really unraveled at the end for me with the overall lack of continuity. Starting with the attack by the doctor: They fought in the train car. The next scene is the Last Supper setup in the tunnel. How did we get there? Why did Poirot let the doctor go, after assaulting him? That's not answered. Then, following the revelation of the killer (including the murder scene, which I thought was hilarious), we see Poirot talk to Penelope Cruz. Why? Doesn't matter. Then, shortly after, Poirot is off the train. Cut to: Poirot, in the train, ready with all his stuff to leave. There's no sense of time. Anywhere. Throughout the film. We jump all over the place very quickly. Despite good talent, with decent characters, I think the pace really ruined things for me. ",7byfpg

There was also some rather questionable acting IMO, albeit from the less-central characters, *but* Daisy Ridley, who I've not seen before was really good - probably the best performance. ",7byfpg
dpuji8h,"Just saw it, raw thoughts.

Visuals, costumes sets, are all wonderful.

Many others have posted in chorus about some of the issues, that I agree with.

The movie takes a very long time setting up the initial premise, with very little detail or emotion, which makes it almost instantly discard-able. No clues given to the viewer to pay attention to. No intrigue. No subtlety.

When the crew finally gets on the train, and they get moving I start to get hopeful - finally we are getting to the meat of the fun, a really fun murder mystery in an enclosed setting with a bunch of strangers with strong personalities. Sign me up. None of the characters are interesting, so it's really hard to just blame the acting. But it all falls apart, almost all of it. Some very big risks were taken in cinematography, and some cool creative concepts, but done so in absolutely lazily and sloppily. I cared nothing about any character. I didn't like any of them. From the start of the movie, I hated every character they met, every single one. I was given absolutely no reason why I should be interested in any ones.

The tone of the movie is completely uneven! It is absolutely not funny or quirky. The trailer made me think we were going to get a slick, slow burn, dialog/writing, quirky whodunit? (Clue is still the best ever). From the very start of the movie, it gets so painfully unfunny I thought it was trying to be ironic. It's very confusing.

Leaving the train ruins the whole thing. The payoff is awful. Logic gaps - but easy problems could have been solved with better writing. Just lazy.

I went in with really good intentions. I wanted dialog. I wanted juicy details. I wanted quirkiness and thoughtfulness. It had none of that. The most bothersome of all, is the missed potential. This could have been made into a good movie.

PS. What the FUCK is up with Poirot? More on the topic of tone, the end of the movie DRAGS ON after the reveal, AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SAD FOR Poirot???? What the FUCK. That movie should have ended 5 minutes after the reveal. Crime against humanity, trying to turn the tone to make the audience SAD or something? All fun is gone.

dplsexf,"Meh...it was pretty well-acted but the writing was lacking. They could have done a better job with the screenplay. I feel like, the way they wanted to tell the story in this film, it would have benefited from cutting a few of the suspects out and fleshing who's left out more. The ending was super predictable and dumb, but I feel that's more because the ending' s been ripped off so many times in other detective stories (all I could think about was the bank episode of Monk).",7byfpg
dpnyqbd,"It felt like the movie was over in 45 min. One of the things that stood out to me was that, with so many big Hollywood names, none of them were overly forced into the spotlight. Its like they cared more about making a good movie than getting the exposure to the audience. Hercule Poirot reminded me a little of Peter Seller's Inspector Clouseau but much less bumbling of course.

There was a little lack of dread and urgency which might have been unintentionally clever. The whole mystery did feel more like doing a puzzle than solving a murder as the conductor suggested (I don't recall exact dialogue of this). However, so many movies turn everything up to 11 I found myself enjoying that it was just a simple, classic mystery and never tried to be more than that or get preachy about something.

But overall this movie was very ""meh"". I can't call it bad and the setting and style was definitely cool but as a standalone movie it didn't feel very engaging with the clues but maybe I'm just dumb.

If it weren't for all the high profile actors I would actually think this was just a high budget TV movie and I wouldn't tell any of my friends to go to the theater to watch this movie. 

The movie just made me feel like I should know more about Poirot but I don't so it's extremely hard to get invested in his turmoil or actions later on in the film. Did anyone else who has never read or seen any previous iterations of this feel the same way? ",7byfpg

Also make up, lighting or a camera filter has made characters look sickly and almost everybody's eyes were red. I am taking a guess that was on purpose, but it made me think everybody was stoned. 

I already knew the story so mostly just wanted to see how characters were depicted. Enjoyed most of them but needed more Dafoe. 

The score for me seemed forgettable Started with great promise and then faded away. A lot of this movie seems like it was rushed. Don't know if that was the case or not Branaugh has generally impressed me with his direction. ",7byfpg
dpnop8c,"So I spent the past week and a half going through the book (the first Agatha Christie and Poirot novel I've read, though I have played a video game adaptation of 'The ABC Murders'), and just got back from seeing the film and I was quite disappointed.

First of all I feel like this is a poor book to try and adapt to the big screen since most of it is pretty uneventful and takes place in one location, the train. I can see they tried to remedy that by having a somewhat lengthy opening section starting in Jerusalem and by having conversations between characters take place in varied locations including outside the train, though I feel the opening section was too long and I didn't like how there was no sequence or structure like in the novel where Poirot investigates the crime scene and then one by one interviews the suspects.

There was little to no discussion about the case between Poirot and Bouc, and Dr Constantine was cut for the film so I think that handicapped the story in that we don't really know what Poirot is thinking and the clues he's trying to use to solve the mystery. As a result the movie doesn't feel like the books where you're following along with Poirot and trying to make guesses as to what is going on, instead you're just watching random events happen and it makes it quite boring throughout the mid-section of the film. I feel like in this regard the film should have tried to put more emphasis on the details and facts of the case, and also towards the pyschology of the suspects, their backgrounds, etc. 

With the characters there were too many to make it work in a movie. Some were changed, some exaggerated, and others barely touched upon. Examples here would be the backstory of MacQueen (Josh Gad) which isn't in the book; Penelope Cruz's character who is meant to be Swedish in the book was exaggeratedly religious for a seemingly comedic effect, or to sell her as an archetype (The Missionary in the trailer for the film); Ratchett was cartoonishly villainious in the short time we see him, I think it would've been better if, like in the book, we don't really know how bad a man he is until we discover his true identity; also the Italian in the novel who was changed to a Hispanic? (I think) in the movie barely had any lines or involvement in the plot at all.

I think certain bits were a bit too 'hollywood' such as MacQueen burning the accounts, Colonel Arbuthnot shooting Poirot, and Mrs Hubbard being stabbed, the latter two make no sense in the context of the ending as well, they didn't *need* to happen, though like I said before, the book might've been a bit too dull as a movie if they didn't try to spice it up a bit, but personally I'm fine with it being more boring if it makes more sense. Also the ending felt a bit convoluted for dramatic purposes compared to the book where it is more simple.

Finally I didn't really like the way they added a more emotional side to Poirot. I think that too many detective stories take themselves too seriously and have to have serious, brooding characters with deep and dark backstories. Poirot is fun to read for me because of his book personality. He is quite content, self-assured, and really loves to get to the bottom of a case. Some moments in this film felt at odds with this type of Poriot (him losing his temper one or two times, his whole internal philosophical debate about Justice, and the backstory about his love).

That was quite long winded and don't take it too personally if I was too negative, if you liked some of the things I didn't that's great but for me I just had so many grievances with the film and much prefer the book.",7byfpg

dprfvkl,"This was a bad movie.

The movie was full of holes:

[How did Poirot magically know how every person on the train was related to the family without anyone being able to give that information to him?

How is it possible that Poirot heard Ratchett whisper from his room but not hear like 10 people stumbling in and out of the room?

Why would a legendary detective suddenly stop caring about crime and let everyone go free for no reason at all.
How does he magically know the awnser without being presented with any kind of proof that would validate that awnser.](#spoiler)

This movie was trying to hard to be dramatic and deep whilst it was a dumb movie, a group of young girls in front of me didn't understand what was happening at all and I was behind them facepalming at how incredibly forced and shitty the story was.

I'm baffled that this movie get's rated as high as it is, movie is fun for small children that don't care about a cohesive plot and just want a cheap ""oh my gosh"" moment. 4/10.

As soon as you question that, it just goes downhill. Beautiful cinematography, great execution of the character, boring boring boring script. The trailer made it seem much more upbeat and set the expectation for major and clever plot twists. The way they played it out was underwhelming. ",7byfpg

dpnk8zj,"I enjoyed the movie a lot. I do wish that they had kept it a bit simpler as more of an ode to the book (that last scene in the tunnel was a bit much) but I can appreciate both as separate entities. 

One of my favorite things about reading old school murder mysteries is the simplicity of them. Crime happens, detective solves the crime while the readers get to guess along with the book and then the detective leaves to solve his next case. There's no intense character development; we're not made to care about the brooding detectives past that lead him to want to solve crimes. It's just a fun mystery. When it comes to most Agatha Christie novels, I'm able to cuddle up with the story and finish it in a few hours. Modern day detective novels are so exhausting (hint to mystery writers: not every book needs to be 500 pages long).

All that being said, I think this movie did a good job of combining the classic 'who-done-it' with just a bit of a modern touch to keep it interesting. 

Also, that mustache was everything. ",7byfpg

Even if they were deemed necessary though, why didn't we frame it in such a way that these events were witnessed by Poirot, so that they weren't just for the audience, but information for him as well?

The Suchet version is far superior, and seemed to provide both the characters and plot details with greater depth despite its shorter runtime. All in all though, I think Branagh did a great job. I really did love this film. ",7byfpg

Not great, but enjoyable and terrific from a technical standpoint.",7byfpg
dpp69xw,"was it just me or was that a harry potter reference when he finds out that Daisy Ridley's character's middle name was ""Hermione""? And then proceeds to pontificate about how murder is akin to ""splitting your soul"" (aka like a horcrux)?",7byfpg
dplsq4a,"My less-than-stellar review:


All aboard Kenneth Branagh’s Murder on the Orient Express - a train journey to die for. He’s injected Agatha Christie’s murder mystery with a star-studded cast, featuring the likes of Judi Dench and Johnny Depp. To detail each character and their role would be both procedural and flat, which is perhaps fitting considering the way this film goes about its narrative.


It begins superbly, at least, opening with Egypt, eggs and an efficiently-solved case of thievery. Poirot and his outrageous moustache get the job done, establishing both his quick-thinking and overbearing fixation on balance that is returned to throughout the film. It’s fun, splendidly realised and deliciously nostalgic; a shame then, considering the rest of the film doesn’t follow suit.


Poirot boards the titular train, and we are met with a fascinating group of strangers, each (knowingly) fitting an archetype that could be expected in a murder mystery - the butler, the count, the missionary. And indeed these introductory scenes chug along nicely, until the murder itself.


The reveal of this murder - a bird’s-eye view that floats between rooms from above, surveilling each individual as specimens - is a strange choice, reminding the audience of the film’s staginess while at once removing the audience from the danger. It’s at odds with Branagh’s interest in breaching those confines. Hulking images of the mountainous landscape and various set pieces that take place outside the train all attempt to dramatise the novel into a justifiable cinematic expedition. However, this poses another problem: by expanding the setting, we lose the pressure-cooker the train transforms into. The potential for the claustrophobia that would arise from a collection of passengers (one of whom is a murderer) trapped in a train mired by snow simply isn’t capitalised on. As such, Murder on the Orient Express is stuck in the middle, not cinematic nor cramped enough to make the whole endeavour worthwhile.


Instead, what follows is a series of interviews Poirot conducts with each passenger - it’s hardly stimulating stuff. The film becomes so enamoured with breaking each character motivation down and concealing its well-known reveal that it forgets to focus on everything else. The problem is that the murder mystery genre is at a state whereby every film of its ilk is defined by its twist. In 1934, Christie’s novel was created as a subversion of the genre - likewise in Lumet’s 1974 adaptation. Here, it’s not a subversion but a faithful rendering of many of its genres tropes. The ending shouldn’t be the point of the film - yet in Branagh’s adaptation, it’s the only point that holds his interest.


The elements that do work well are those that have been plucked from the pages of Christie: the mullings on morality, the deconstruction of its own genre via its characterised archetypes. Unfortunately, these are relegated to latent qualities, forsaken for tidy visuals and pained attention to narrative detail. Yet perhaps Murder on the Orient Express’ greatest sin is its inability to justify its existence. It has an eye-popping cast and rich source material to mine from, but both go wasted. There are no current-affair observations, no true deviations, nor is there a reason to care. What Branagh has created is a film that is already outdated, stranded between a popcorn flick and an intelligent thriller with musings on sin and morals (half-assed biblical imagery of the Last Supper included). Sadly, Murder on the Orient Express doesn’t so much as lose steam as derail. Perhaps it should have stayed buried under the snow.",7byfpg

dpm9940,"The story was too convoluted. It's probably a great book but as a movie it was too much information too quickly. Nothing felt like it had a big impact because it went by so quick and so many names were dropped.

They sacrificed everything interesting and every reason why we should care for the killers, and all we got in exchange was some weak action sequences and Poirot looking dramatic, confused or sad.

I feel like there should have been at least *some* repercussions for the murderers. ,7byfpg

I can't imagine a director having Dame Judi Dench and letting her sit in the background the whole time. She might as well have been a cardboard cutout stand-in. She had so few lines. What a waste.

A man was murdered!

He killed a little girl cause I got a 
letter a while back about it! Ah, Ha! 
YOU were the nanny! 
YOU were the sister! 
YOU were the brothers cousins ex girlfriends mother who fell in love with one of the jurors uncles sisters brother! AH, HA! 
I know this because of that.. that letter.. that one time. And cause I’m smart! Did the movie mention how smart I am? Cause I AM SO SMART! Trust me on that. 

Let me monologue again instead of having actual conversations with people! 

Also here is the photo of Katherine again. That girl I say I love who you don’t know about.. don’t worry about it though. I’ll talk to her real quick and make it super cringy for you. 

 I disliked this movie very much. The cinematography was good.. But none of that matters with a junk script. And you
can have the coolest actors in the world on screen, but if youre not doing anytjing intrigueing with them.. whats the point?

dq1pgmc,"I feel like at least 95% of people seeing this movie have missed what Branagh does with the story. The introductory stepping both shoes in the dung, and the desire for two perfectly-sized eggs, and the ""would you please straighten your tie"" are not just to illustrate how eccentric Poirot is but are to highlight how shocking the end of the movie really is. Yes the plot is contrived, but it is making a larger point (that seems to have gone over most people's heads unfortunately). A writer is supposed to respect the intelligence of their audience to ""connect the dots"" and the filmmaker here does the same. The movie is about [the nature of true justice, as illustrated by BALANCE, as in the Scales of Justice. It is this pursuit of justice that drives Poirot and in this case he does something truly groundbreaking: Once he solves the case he subverts what he knows will be the imperfect human justice system. He becomes the judge and jury and goes against every fiber in his being to do so, because he knows that the conspiracy has actually acted to bring about justice on the (real) perpetrator. It is this obsessive pursuit of balance, in the form of true justice, that is illustrated by the stepping in dung, the perfectly-sized eggs, and the straightened tie.

I haven't read the book or seen any of the other film adaptations so I'm not sure how they handled these issues, and I'm not really sure how I'd fix them either, but I think this would have been a lot better if it had just been done differently somehow.

The Armstrong story could have used a more fluid reveal, and a little more dwelling on the details. They could have linked everyone to it a little more slowly. It felt a little too forced.

You'd think a genius detective would be able to figure out that perhaps, more than one of them could be involved as soon as he figures out that more than 1 person is connected to the Armstrong case.

Also, Poirot slipped out of his accent a few times. You could also hear that the actor is not a native french speaker, which is fine, until he makes a big point of the American pretending to he geman pronouncing Turin the way an English speaking person would.

dppgw6t,"I’ll take the 70’s version over this all day long for quite a few reasons but number one is the lack of subtle detective work on display in this one. A pure joy of Poirot is him asking seemingly mundane questions and playing his cards close to his chest. Then revealing at the end how he arrived from simple seemingly irrelevant anecdotes to incredibly important revelations. Poirot is a genius. The audience is not.

But in this version, he is mostly throwing all his ideas out there, bluntly and openly tying everyone to the Armstrong case without much subtlety  or mystery and the rest of the evidence falls by the way side.

Just one example is his interrogation of Schmidt. In the 70’s version he asks her numerous questions before randomly complimenting her good cooking. She brags “all my ladies have said so” before her smile vanishes and Poirot laughs to himself. He trapped her, learned something and revealed nothing. Only later does he explain her connection to the Armstrong’s when he is good and ready.

1) she would risk changing his mind yet again - if he is smart enough to solve the case, he is smart enough to realize when he is being played. If he were about to let them go free, only to see Linda play him, he would certainly then accuse them all.
2) Linda appeared genuinely upset in the seconds leading to her pulling the trigger. The fact that she had just finished pleading to let the others go, before explaining her genuinely depressive ‘my life ended with Daisy’ suggests that she was ready to end her life if needed to free the others, meaning that the scene would have also made sense if she hadn’t planned to turn the gun all along
3) the others appeared genuinely sad during this scene as well
4) the idea that all 12 would have predicted one final moral test presumed that they knew him very well, on a deep level. Remember, he was famous for solving crimes. But, there is nothing to suggest that they know every bit of his eccentric/obsessive-compulsive need for polarized perfection. 

I don’t doubt that what you are saying is a possibility. However, the scene would also work without that final step of strategy. We are made to believe that P was the smartest/best person on the train. If he believes they are genuinely remorseful, non-murders who are in some type of agony (mentioned when he said he hopes they find peace), they don’t need to play him - it’s quite possible that someone who isn’t inclined to murder would try and kill themselves before killing an innocent man in P. That the point, their act was only about revenge against Cassetti, not about murdering everyone who gets in the way. ",7byfpg

No. I think he was mainly trying to draw heat away from Mary by implicating himself, to protect her.

>I know the doctor was lying to protect Mary but how did Poirot know?

Poirot overheard a conversation between the two of them at the beginning of the movie when the three of them were on the boat.

dqldzs3,"I really appreciate this review.  As someone who came into the movie  without knowledge of the story some things definitely frustrated me that you have helped clear up.  

The story is obviously a classic and the movie has a lot of good elements.  

The introduction of the Poirot's character was pretty well done for someone unfamiliar with the character.  Im not sure how authentic the interpretation was (according to this thread its decent) but the audience got the idea he was sherlock holmes type , but better with people (still not great) based off how he dealt with the kid with the eggs in the opening scene. I wish his character had some more obvious faults though besides being somewhat distant his character seemed too pure if that makes sense.  

I thought this film desperately needed some more tension.  Some scenes could have been improved if Poirot had time going against him.  Like if the Yugoslav police should have been a more active threat during the film instead of a footnote as to why Poirot should involve himself.  Also when Ratchett pulled the gun it felt way more nonchalant when it should have been.  Even if Poirot isnt threatened and disarms him it still adds so much to the Ratchett character.  The Gun without any tension behind it makes it seem like a bad negotiator and not capable of actually using it.  When in reality it really isnt the case as he is a child kidnapper and murder.  

The additions of those two added scenes you mentioned I couldnt agree more with.  They both felt out of place.  It seems like they added some actions as a break from the interrogations, but they didnt make sense for the characters. Especially Dr. Arbuthnot shooting Poirot but since he could have killed him and didnt he is not a true killer?  Shooting someone is still a serious crime and a causes a serious injury even now let alone in 1930s yugoslavia.   The fact that some of the side characters could have been more fleshed out instead of these two scenes is a mistake.  


The ending kind of spoiled the film for me.  I know it stays true to the source material by letting them all go but they didnt do a good job convincing the audience  that Poirot's decision was right/noble.  They should have went into more depth about Daisy Armstrongs kidnapping/death or after all the identities were revealed how the Armstrongs and Susanne were tremendous people worth killing for.  It really would have been easy considering Rachett was a child murder.  Even if they fleshed out the side characters more would have helped the ending because for half of them all we know is that they are liars and they killed someone thats it.  Definitely not enough to absolve them of their crimes.   Killing someone who has wronged you isnt that uncommon of a reason to commit murder so the fact Poirot a seasoned detective lets like 10 people go after this planned murder is insane to me.  The fact that they didnt try to shoot Poirot when he hands them that unloaded pistol really didnt convince me that these people were one time criminals either especially after one shot Poirot and one was stealing money and all constantly lied to him throughout the journey. 

I though overall the film had some solid acting, and some solid technical camera work.  It was desperate need of more tension and a good score.  The score/music almost was non existent when it would have added so much to every scene and i think the biggest blunder the movie makes.  ",7byfpg

No, no, no, no, no. You're asking for an entirely different genre. This is **detective fiction.** The great detective does not need a reason to solve a case.

> Above all, the film misunderstands Christie and does not strike the right tone: it treats what is a cynical, tidy little genre piece as if it were a Greek tragedy.

On this point, I think the film spent far too much time focusing on the character of Poirot. Clearly they were trying to introduce him as a protagonist in the event of a sequel, but he is not intended to be an interesting character with a ton of screen time. Poirot exists to guide the reader through the mystery and put the pieces together at the end, but in all of his stories it's the supporting cast and the mystery itself that are the stars. He is very different to someone like Sherlock Holmes, but Branagh failed to realise this. ",7byfpg

dppixqi,"Not the OP but I'm gonna chime in - Poirot isn't as OCD in the novels; he's particular about certain things, and he is vain about his appearance, but it's not as overdone as it was in the film. It was a little too eccentric for my liking even though I do think Branagh is always fun to watch. ",7byfpg
dpqljwt,"> Not having read it myself, how is Christie's description different?

First of all, he's really short. Branagh was too tall and too intimidating. Poirot is also not an aggressive detective. He rarely shouts at suspects in order to intimidate them and he does not get involved in chases or action. Poirot usually has a younger, fitter male counterpart who does any physical work (chasing and apprehending suspects). The chase scene in this film was extremely out of character and also made no sense considering his walking stick. If he's still injured from the war, why is he running around? If he's not injured, why does he have the walking stick? Purely as a weapon? Come on... 

Poirot's personality is also very different to Branagh's interpretation. He is not as OCD and nowhere near as intentionally humorous. Most of the humour is usually derived from Poirot, who is extremely fastidious and usually quite serious, running into everyday problems that he believes he is above. Poirot would never have made that bad joke at the start and then said ""forgive me, I'm Belgian"". Poirot can be charming because he is well dressed and well spoken, but other characters often find him arrogant and annoying. Christie actually hated Poirot as a protagonist and only kept him around because he was so popular with her readers. 

His detective methods are very different in the books and every other adaptation. Poirot is not the Sherlock Holmes type, running around examining the crime scene with microscopic detail and shouting at people. He prefers to focus on the psychology of the suspects and looks for weaknesses or inconsistencies in their statements and body language. Poirot will interview suspects multiple times and relies on his charming/irritating little man persona to either lull suspects into a false sense of security or irritate them to the point that they slip up. The film did not have anywhere near enough interviewing for a Poirot story. 

> Can you give me some examples? While things did seem a bit rushed, I feel like I caught every detail and everything was accounted for ... maybe I missed a bunch of things?

The kimono is a major part of the original story. Poirot questions every female passenger about it with no success, and it turns up much later in the story at a point when he is kind of stuck and the ""challenge"" drives him on to solve the mystery. In the film, it seemed almost like an afterthought. 

Similarly, the missing conductor (the ""dark man with a womanish voice"") plays an important role in the original story because he is believed to be the murderer Poirot is searching for, but does not match the description of any passenger on the train. This is actually an extremely important part of the story because it is the central part of the revenge plan. The passengers did not expect the snowdrift and so their original plan was that the murderer (the missing conductor) escaped at the next stop. The missing passenger who Poirot replaces, Mr Harris, was actually a fictitious person invented by the other passengers so they could direct the investigation elsewhere. However this isn't really made clear in the film, so the murder seems rather rushed and poorly thought out when in reality it would have been a perfect plan if not for the snowdrift and Poirot. The inclusion of a black character in the film muddles this clue because he seems to match the ""dark"" description. 

Whilst all the crime scene clues appear in the film, it's actually the interactions between the passengers that are the biggest clues and this is where the film fell apart. It spent so much time introducing them beforehand when really we needed to see more of them on board the train. Most characters were only interviewed once and some of the biggest twists (the Countess being revealed as the Armstrong sister, for example) are discovered immediately when in the book and other adaptations they are only discovered after multiple interviews and Poirot stewing over clues (like the smudge in the passport) for a long time. 

As an aside, because I can't remember if this is in the original book, in the BBC radio adaptation the snowdrift occurs in front of the train rather than on it, so the rescue team and police have to dig for several days before they reach the train rather than immediately arriving at the crime scene. This heightens the tension significantly and also makes it more believable when Poirot decides not to report the passengers to the police. By the time the police arrive, the case has been ""solved"" and they are informed that the murderer must have escaped the train. Key clues like the lack of footprints in the snow are not a problem because it has snowed since so the police would not know if Poirot and company were lying. In the film, I found it extremely unlikely that police would be walking all over the crime scene but just leave Poirot to his own investigation and not take an interest in the murder.

Sorry for the wall of text, by the way. ",7byfpg
dqqjcbi,"But why??? Is he an aspiring actor? Why add this unnecessary detail at all? He had to pretend to be a professor when buying a ticket - fine. At that point, his views on race didn't matter at all, since all the passengers knew each other, and didn't know Poirot will be on the train. So it appears he added this character detail only once he knew there will be an outsider among them. Which still doesn't make a lot of sense, as it's completely irrelevant in the context of what they want to achieve. ",7byfpg
dpnzxgf,"I feel like these stories are so well known and have been around for so long that the filmmakers can't expect the film to function well only if you don't know the outcome.

I can understand how you were unhappy with Branagh's interpretation.  Never having read the book, I was able to enjoy the performance for what it was.  But I get your criticism.

The way you described Poirot made me think of TV's Columbo ...

>  not tall and not intimidating. not an aggressive detective. He rarely shouts at suspects in order to intimidate them and he does not get involved in chases or action ... will interview suspects multiple times and relies on his charming/irritating little man persona to either lull suspects into a false sense of security or irritate them to the point that they slip up. 

Similarly, I'd be pretty disgusted if they re-made the legendary Columbo into some kind of action hero.

Thanks for the good read.

dpnokmt,">He's a genius detective without question, but he is also a very peculiar man with a grating personality (he might even have OCD in the books? which further lends him to be rigid and structured to a fault [not that he can help it]);

Branagh's version was that too. They establish that within the first 30 seconds of the movie. I just felt that he added more of a personal, human core to the character that wasn't really there with Suchet's version. Which, to be fair to Suchet, Branagh was able to do because of scenes specifically devoted to probing Poirot's character that were written into the script and because he was also the director.

>he's not supposed to be very likeable at all.

I think die-hard Agatha Christie fans would say he is likeable, or at least that they like him. That wasn't really what I was saying though. I thought that Suchet's Poirot was likeable (enough), but also kind of emotionally hollow or two-tone.

That may be true.  He still shot him though which is still a serious crime anywhere.  Just because he didnt intend to kill him doesnt make the shooting forgivable, thats a serious injury in 2017 let alone in the 1930s.

He seemed to think he was being targeted for ripping people off, so he possibly didn't even make the connection (unless he was covering his real crime then who knows).

I would also hope that there's more to the plan to avoid the racist assumptions at the next stop. They could have chucked the body and made it look like he killed himself by jumping out a window (for example).  The fact that the avalanche hit & the best detective in the world boarded the train almost derailed everything but they stuck with it, so we saw the result of scheme gone awry.

I agree nitpicking feasibility is fairly pointless, but it didn't really feel *silly* to me. Granted it was pretty elaborate, however it worked in Ocean's 11 when a team of people were in cahoots to accomplish a crime--this story felt similar, but the audience wasn't clued in.

To them, a trial in the legal system would not have provided the closure that they needed in order to move on.  A large part of their motive for planning the murder together was to unload their respective emotional burdens.  This was their way of making the world right again after witnessing a senseless act of violence bestowed upon those who did not deserve it in the slightest.

I mean, if you were REALLY going to kill someone efficiently, you wouldn't try to crowd 12 people in what appeared to be something like a 5' x 5' train cabin and have them each take a stab at the guy.  It's just totally nonsensical to do that instead of just sending one guy to take Ratchett out.  The guy's drugged out on barbitol, he's certainly not waking up.

There was one writer, Agatha fucking Christie, and she fucking laid the groundwork for the *precursors* of what we call formulaic now.
