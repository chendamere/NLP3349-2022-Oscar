d0o80eq,"The scene of Judy arriving by train to Zootopia is one of the best animated scenes I've seen in years. Total sense of wonder and youthful excitement of going out in the world for the first time. The movie itself was pretty good, but I want to see more of that world they built. The city and it's diverse geographic neighbors were beautifully designed. ",48vhc8

d0n3ocy,"This movie was really surprising with its fair treatment of mature and current themes. No wonder why all they showed in the first trailers was that funny sloth.

Seriously, the only flaw that kinda annoys me about this is how they forced Shakira's character for no reason but to deliver that theme song. And even then, the song is stuck in my ears.",48vhc8
d0mzmg3,"Everyone is already talking about the characters and story so I'll go and say this: THIS MOVIE IS SO INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL!

I could tell the animators put in a ton of time to make their characters as detailed as possible in the movie posters and trailers but in the movie they take it even further. Even tiny stuff like Mr. Otterton's graying hairs, the various canines' nosepads, or even stuff like when Nick was playing around with Bellwether's hair, the movie is just bleeding with fine-combed detail. Not easy when you have just about every single kind of mammal represented.

Even then the locale and huge range of scale within the city of Zootopia is amazing, especially since the vast majority of the film is done on Judy's and Nick's level so people like elephants or Bogo all the way down to hamsters gives the feel of such an impressive scope to everything around them. Even cooler to see how Zootopia accommodates everyone due to that fact.

As everyone else has already said, the characters feel real in their personality, the story is a little cliche but well executed, and overall it's a solid film. I'm not sure how plausible a Zootopia 2 could be but I could easily see a lot of shorts coming out in the future even if they didn't focus on Judy/Nick just to explore the world even more.",48vhc8
d0niem9,Young Nick was soooo cute! It breaks my heart to know that's probably the saddest sequence in the whole movie.,48vhc8
d0ojwui,"Saw this film with my sister yesterday. Couple thoughts.

1) This movie is great. Wonderful design and animation. The story is good. The voice acting is spot on on. Kudos to all involved. So, so much better than the trailers. So cute!

2) Judy Hopps is one of the most feminine characters I've seen on screen recently. The chest head-butt crying scene. That's a thing! Girls do that! 

3) I love what they did with Gideon, the bully fox from the beginning. I know so many people who turned out like that. 

4) This movie is smart. It takes its chosen issues head on, but in a way that lets everyone feel like it's talking about them. As someone else said, it's not about the racism or sexism of a specific time and place, it's about the ideas as a whole, and shows how everyone experiences prejudice in one way or another.

5) What a fantastic piece of propaganda. There is a moral message you are intending to push with this film, and even seeing it happening, it didn't bother me. I even liked it.

d0o8ldn,"At 428 comments my input is practically pissing into the ocean but I'll throw my two cents into it. (for reference this is from the prospective of a 17 year old guy and his friends)

This movie is fucking fantastic. We were planning on going to see London has fallen. As a joke I said instead why don't we see Zootopia as a joke because I REALLY don't care about London has Fallen. Somehow I got everyone to agree and so we went in knowing literally nothing, other than there was a sloth in the movie at some point. We were all shocked immediately by the darker/depressing themes of giving up and settling and of course found them hilarious. 

It turned out to be a very serious movie covered up in incredibly beautiful animation and cute animals. Also I can't stress this enough the voice acting and the animation are goddamn incredible. Personally I believe this is most well-animated movie I have seen...ever. The themes of racism, sexism, and corruption are not too heavy handed that they become annoying however they are there for anyone who may have been forced to take their kids to what was assumed to be a rather childish movie, but disney managed to make this a movie enjoyable for kids both young and old as well as adults. If you haven't even considered seeing this movie and are for some reason reading this post. GO SEE IT. I thought Finding Dory was going to be my favorite cartoon of 2016 but damn it's going to have a seriously tough time beating Zootopia.

d0ou5by,"I found it really nice that they credited first the lead designers, animators, etc. at the closing credit, instead of the lead actors and actresses. It goes to show how much importance they put into the animation, which in turn, rewards the movie a beautifully designed animated universe. This has to be one of the most craftily creative 3D animations made, especially in terms of environment design. 

That reconciliation scene between Nick and Judy when she steps out of the shade and into the light, pinpointing the exact moment of the pair reuniting. That, that was animated poetry.",48vhc8

d0oyczb,"Of all the messages in the movie, the most complex message in my opinion was that you can be someone's friend and think the world of them in a particular capacity but still think that they are inferior to you due to some immutable characteristic. Judy thinks highly of Nick, believes he'd be a great cop and shouldn't let the fact that he's a fox define him, and considers him to be her friend. Almost immediately thereafter Judy speaks to the public and expresses her belief that all predators are savages and predetermined to behave in a dangerous way based on their DNA. She even admits that she finds Nick to be dangerous based on his genetics. How do these two schools of thought interact with each other? Is my friend of a different ethnicity really my friend? What if he believes I am inferior/dangerous/stupid/untrustworthy due to my ethnicity? Is he still my friend? The movie takes a position and says ""No.""

Consider this: a person is accused of being racist for their treatment of blacks. The accused responds truthfully that there's no way she is racist because her best friend is black! Couldn't Judy have made a similar argument if she was accused of being racist? And would her argument have been persuasive? I don't think so, especially before the apology scene, because despite being friends with Nick, she holds a belief that he is inferior due to his genetics. So you, you might have good friends that are of a different ethnicity, but does that preclude you from being racist? I don't think so. ",48vhc8

It's on the high end of what you would expect from a Disney movie.

But what really, *really* made the movie for me was the surgeon-like precision and delicacy with which it imparts general lessons about prejudice and acceptance. A lot of people have been saying the movie has allegories for racism, sexism, and the like, but I think it actually does *better* than that.

d0p39di,Zootopia: or HOLY SHIT IS THIS CHILDREN'S MOVIE COMMENTING ON RACE RELATIONS IN AMERICA?,48vhc8
d0mzmbh,"Zootopia is a funny, beautiful, and entertaining commentary on race relations, prejudice, and stereotypes all wrapped up in a Bunny *ahem!* Buddy Cop movie. 

When I heard that it had commentary on race relations, I will admit that I rolled my eyes thinking that it was gonna be heavy handed and corny. I'm glad that I was wrong. The citizens of Zootopia being divided by Prey and Predator was a simple and clever way to introduce the idea to kids, but not make it so ham fisted that adults would be bothered by it. 

The plot is pretty cliche. Judy Hopps, a small town bunny, aspires to make a difference in the world by defying the odds and becoming the first rabbit to graduate the Police Academy, and solve cases. The cliche in this case, isn't a detriment to the overall story of Judy Hopps and her reluctant ally, Nick Wilde. It's predictable, but still very entertaining.

As for the stereotypes, there all animal related and the characters are constantly throwing them at each other at the beginning of the movie. Such as Wolves howling, Foxes are sneaky, and Rabbits are cute, fluffy, and multiply like, uh, rabbits.  There's even a scene when Judy first enters the Police Station shortly after graduation where she has to explain that the  word, ""Cute,"" is a slightly offensive term for bunnies. A lot of the animal stereotypes are played for a gag, such as the sloths working in the DMV, but they don't take away from the overall message.

For parents with younger or more sensitive kiddos, there is a jump scare in the movie when Hopps and Wilde enter an abandoned hospital. I saw it coming a mile away, but I was sucked into the world of Zootopia that it caught me off guard as well as everyone else in the theater.

Speaking of the world, Zootopia is absolutely beautiful. Every scene is gorgeously animated and brought to life. I couldn't help but be immersed in the world from the colorful Downtown, to the dark and wet Rainforest, to the cold and snowy Tundra Town.


This isn't a musical, so parents won't have to worry about listening to  a song about how Predators are not bad animals for the next six months. There is a song by Shakira, who also plays a protester and a Pop Star Gazelle that is kinda catchy, but that's not until the end of the flick.

I can't wait to watch it again, and I highly recommend people do the same.

But shit, it was good. Damn good. Funny and well animated. A good plot, good message for kids and adults. And jokes for everybody. 


Judy was a fantastic lead character and one that anyone can easily stand behind.  The sloth scene almost killed me, and I am happy it wasn’t spoiled to me with that sloth trailer I later found out about. It was a good joke to throw in Alan Tudyk again as a character named Duke from Weaseltown. Breaking Bad references! 


Now, a lot of it felt predictable. The lamb being the villain was pretty obvious early on. Awkward Giselle/Shakira song forcing. 


But I want more Zootopia. I think I want it in a TV show, that way they can get me a lot of sweet episodes like a police procedural. I wouldn’t want to wait five years just to get one story movie again. Do it Disney.

d0mxam1,"Really, really enjoyed this movie - unexpected references, and it was fun. Even though it's a kid's movie, I think the older kids (and I mean older than 4) will enjoy it a lot more than really little kids - there was some really quick, easy-to-miss one-line funnies that went over some of the little ones but made the older ones laugh. 

I didn't expect the movie to move so quickly into its story - that was a nice surprise. The pacing was pretty tight; the only ""slow"" scene was the sloth scene and that ...well, yeah. That makes sense. The film was quick to keep the story moving, and the callbacks weren't super cheesy. It was like...Hot Fuzz Jr. I really, really enjoyed the dynamics of Nick and Judy. Definitely ended up wanting to see more of their antics - Bateman's perfect at playing the fox, but there's so many great back-and-forth moments between Bateman and Goodwin. I feel kind of dirty for saying that there was some fantastic chemistry but there you go.

d0mym5v,"I LOVED this movie. Absolutely loved it. Honestly, this is comparable to some of Pixar's best work. If you're turned off from seeing it because you think it's a kids' movie, I really think you owe it to yourself to reconsider because this was really, crazy good.      
  
First, there are tons of jokes here aimed directly at adults, and I would argue most of them land really well. We have references to pop stars, mob movies, hit TV shows, dealing with bureaucracy, etc. that were clearly made with adults in mind. Disney picked this strategy up from other studios and it works really well here.  
  
Second, there's something refreshing and captivating about the world these creatures live in. The scene where the protagonist, Judy, first arrives in Zootopia by train, drew me in. Each of the different eco-zones in the city is beautifully crafted and interesting. If the city existed (say, as a theme park), it would be a place I would want to visit.  
  
Third, the character development in this film is top notch. Judy Hopps and Nicholas Wilde are not perfect, cute little creatures. They have serious character flaws. They both have their own form of prejudice stemming from childhood experiences. Despite that, they're able to come together and become close friends in a way that's moving and believable.  
  
But it's not just the main characters. It seems like every named character has something interesting to offer in terms of development. Take Mayor Lionheart for example. Here we have a character who starts out as an obvious loudmouthed caricature. But by the time the movie reaches the end, we find out he has both good and bad reasons driving his actions. Why does he [do what he does?](#s ""i.e. capture the predators"") You can say that he's acting selfishly to protect himself or you can say that it was out of a genuine desire to protect the city. Look at Judy's parents. At first, they don't believe in her because they're worried about the world crushing her spirit, but slowly they come around to supporting her. Even for a kids movie, the characters are well rounded and top notch.  
  
Some have said the story is predictable. I can't speak for those people, but at the risk of sounding dim, I'll admit I didn't really see what was coming until the train station scene. It was a genuinely mild surprise to me with, once again, a relatable character acting for understandable reasons (i.e. being treated poorly).  
  
Finally, the film borrows from Aesop's playbook to bring us an important moral that is worth learning: Try everything, don't let people box you into a stereotype, and be open minded about other people and who they can be. There were obvious references that paralleled with race and issues of inclusion that I thought were really well done.  
  
Overall, this movie at least a 9 out of 10 for me. I know you think it's a kids' movie, but please--don't just make a snap judgment. Be open minded and give it a try.

d1nandj,"Holy crap that was *a lot* better than I expected. I mean I like disney, but usually their films are a bit campy, and forced. 

But holy shit that was good. 

I mean other than the obvious ""racism is bad, everyone is equal"" morals/metaphors/allegories, it was really subtle too. There were some parts where I went ""wow that was really clever"". 

I went in expecting a solid 6-7/10, campy, catering to young kids, wanting to sell toys and spinoffs. What I got was a solid 9/10, with great story telling, amazing characters, tremendous writing and acting, and more subtlety than expected. 

The only part I really can complain about is that awful shakira song. So hamfisted and forced, and really doesn't fit the mood at all. But that wasn't *that* bad. I just hated it. 

Seriously though, if you're on the fence about seeing it, do it! It's seriously good. Honestly I was blown away by it. It's not just your average campy disney movie trying to sell toys, and create a myriad of spin-offs and cash-ins.

d0pge8m,"After reading through a lot of the comments, I felt a compulsion to say something.

Damn near every animated kids movie for *at least* the past two decades has had some kind of overarching message in them, often multiple messages, something more than just ""the hero does cool stuff and saves the day"". I'm actually having trouble thinking of a Disney movie that *doesn't* have any moral to it at all.

Just a few examples: ""Don't take life/time/friends for granted"" (Up, Toy Story, Lion King). ""Kids need space, but also appreciate and respect your parents"" (Finding Nemo, Brave). ""Be open to new experiences and new ways of doing things"" (Toy Story, Brave, Monsters Inc, and I know it's not Disney, but HTTYD). And even ""don't prejudge/underestimate people"" (Beauty and the Beast, Pocahontas, Ratatouille, Wreck-it-Ralph, Lilo and Stitch, and again not Disney, but Shrek).

Virtually no one calls these movies ""propaganda"" even though plenty of them have clear messages they're trying to convey to the audience, including kids. Not even the movies about prejudice and preconceptions normally get called propaganda. Granted, a lot of the movies with a message about prejudice, usually focus the message on a discriminated individual rather than groups.

Zootopia just takes that same message and makes it clear that it also applies to more wide-reaching real life examples like race. The message in this movie isn't that new, even for Disney. What's new is that they weren't afraid to use a more controversial example of how this message can be applied, and the movie doesn't dance around that fact at all.

Maybe you didn't like the way the message was handled or portrayed in this movie, or maybe you didn't like the message at all, but the simple fact that it has a message and doesn't cushion it's real-life implications doesn't make this any more propagandic than dozens of other kids movies. ",48vhc8

d0n6cbz,"Firstly I hope Disney continues to use Alan Tudyk for the rest of his life as a character in every flick, because he is an amazing voice actor, wouldn't have even recognized him if it weren't for the Duke Weaselton gag. 

Now, I agree with most of the comments here but my only criticism is that it fell to the bootstraps myth again. They spent all this time establishing that she'd have difficulties as a bunny, and instead of playing to her strengths as a bunny she kind of just blunders onto some clues and lucks out with others. Other than the pen recording and some quick math and plant knowledge, she doesn't actually do anything. Nick did most of the work and thinking. It's mostly just a pet peeve of mine, when children's movies mistake tenacity and lots of luck for hard work. I would have preferred if she hadn't just given up, run away from the mess she started and gone home only to luck out on hearing a colloquialism, but instead had kept working on solving the case. But that's just my personal opinion. 

Also did Disney sneak a gay couple in there? The Oryx neighbours have a hyphenated last name and live in an implied one bedroom. I mean they could easily be brothers too, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was ambiguous on purpose. ",48vhc8
d0vdmm5,"This may be the cleverest animated movie made since Paranorman. What I love is how they show both sides of the argument well, and made the characters believable. Most of all, I loved the way the characters were animated and how they looked. Everything was so smooth and the animals were so diverse. I love the contrast between the small town of the rodents, to the large city with elephants. The city itself is interesting. I love how it has 4 different sections. Hoping in whatever sequel we get, they will go to the desert one, or take more time in the rainforest and tundra areas.

One of my favorite parts is Duke Weasleton. When they mispronounced his name as ""Wesselton"" and he corrects it to ""Weasleton."" His first name is Duke too. Just like in Frozen where they can him the Duke of ""Weasleton"" and he corrects them to the Duke of ""Wesselton."" It's great.",48vhc8

d0t0mr3,"Zootopia is absolutely fantastic.  Every single character in this movie is extremely likable right when you meet them.  Their quick wit and humor make them enjoyable to listen to.  The dialogue is not overly exposition heavy (which can happen a lot in animation movies for younger audiences).  Even though there were some pretty obvious themes being expressed in this (racism, speciesism…?), it never felt like the dialogue explaining those themes was too blatant.  The things the characters were saying seemed like stuff that would have really been said.

The visual comedy in this movie is excellent, especially in that opening sequence when Hopps arrives in Zootopia for the first time.  Every species of animal had their own little pigeonholed quirk that made it really enjoyable to dart your eyes around the screen.  My favorites were the giraffe gags, like when one is coming up the escalator and you see its neck go all the way and out of frame until you see the body, or the giraffe ice cream stand, and the giraffe car that Hopps had to ticket.  Another one that I loved was the lemings all following each other to buy “pawpsicles” haha.

There was also a lot of great humor for adults to pick up on as well.  My favorite was the Frozen reference that the police chief made.  Another good one was the police wolf at the end that was sent undercover in sheep’s skin, hue hue.

There are only two little issues that I have with Zootopia.  The first one is that after the first half, the visual gags became less and less, and those were my favorite elements of this movie.  The second is the way to story was revealed to us.  This movie is essentially a whodunit/whydunit mystery, and along the way Hopps and Nick find new pieces of evidence.  The problem is that the audience never has a chance to figure it out for themselves.  Every time the main characters discover something, it is immediately explained to us, and the audience was never given a previous example to base that guess on.  There aren’t any callbacks (or none that I could tell) to previous events in the movie that make the clues really CLICK.  It’s more of “Oh this new thing is related to this new thing.”  The audience doesn’t get to piece it together, it’s pieced together for them.

Or maybe on a second viewing I’d see EVERYTHING I missed haha.

But hey, it’s an animated Disney film targeted for youngins.  And I loved it.

8/10.  Excited for the inevitable sequel that will not be as good but hopefully still entertaining.

d16idlv,"I enjoyed the movie a lot. The environment it created is brimming with imagination. It was so exciting to see how roles were filled by animals and how different species interacted with each other. I would love to have a discussion of some of the grievances I had about it though. Massive spoilers below.

A criticism I have for the movie, however, has to do with how the plot progressed. Specifically, the film didn't do a good job convincing me that she should have felt guilty about dividing Zootopia. Clearly, what was dividing predators and prey was that animals were going savage; she was not the cause, she just discovered it. I can't really get behind a character that identifies this enormous problem, somehow concludes that she is at fault without further investigation and then quits.

I also thought it was cheap how Judy discovered the source of how animals were going savage. She had exactly one scene where she was back home and by chance, she discovers the nighthowlers, whose effects are immediately explained by her mom. Not much suspense there. When plots are designed like that, they leave no satisfaction for viewers who are trying to solve the mystery on their own.

Another criticism I have was the conflict between Judy and Nick. Nothing actually develops in their relationship between the time that they ""break up"" and get back together. Judy's guilt over what she said is instantaneous and Nick is just a snarky comment away from unquestionable forgiveness. They didn't actually overcome any conflict with each other before becoming 100% chemistry buddy cops.

With that said, there's no doubt that the world crafted in Zootopia fills you with wonder. There's so much potential for new species, crime stories and foreign cities that I can't wait to discover in a sequel. I just hope they can make their stories a little more nuanced. ",48vhc8

The motifs are incredibly relevant and fairly inspiring. The animation was also really good and it's refreshing to see a REALLY good Disney animal movie again - something that hasn't happened in a long time.

The discrimination theme was fresh and interesting and the characters were all cast perfectly and sometimes hilarious. The little Fennec Fox had me in tears when he spoke and every exchange between Judy and her parents gave me a good laugh. ""Oh, thank God! She's a meter maid!""

Bateman and Goodwin carried the story and had wonderful chemistry. The world was interesting and catered to each animals' needs perfectly. Much like Bojack, the animals exhibited personality traits like animals do in real life. The attention to detail was superb and the animation top notch.

The song ""Try Everything"" had a great message, which I felt was touched on throughout the movie. There was plenty of action and a few  really well thought-out jokes. I especially liked the reference to Breaking Bad in the train car.

If anyone has images of the bootleg movies that the Weasel was selling, I'd love to see them! I caught glimpses of them and they all seemed hilarious.

Edit: Words",48vhc8
d0p299t,"([spoilers] is in the thread title, so I hope this doesn't cause issue for anyone.  Tried four different spoiler tags and none worked, even the one suggested in the sidebar, so oh well, here goes)

I expected to like Zootopia, and I ended up liking it even more than I thought I would because of the way they handled some very important issues in a polished manner.  The subjects of racism, prejudice, gender discrimination, and racial profiling are especially pertinent in our current socio-political climate.  Many plot elements of the movie can be interpreted as analogies to Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric, Clinton's ""Apex Predator"" speech, Islamophobia, Black Lives Matter, and Eugenics.  Production began in 2013, it was written and conceived even earlier, before many of the events that we associate it with today. 

It has a timeless theme, prejudice (or bias as Byron Howard states in this article http://io9.gizmodo.com/how-disney-fixed-a-huge-mistake-with-zootopia-just-one-1753845684), and it presents it in a remarkable way.  There is no ham fisted, one dimensional character who is a parody of a bad cop or any particular politician, it's all revealed through the flaws and mistakes of the two protagonists Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde.  We learn of their background, their childhood experiences, their ambitions and setbacks and how that led to the internal struggles they must overcome to become ethical adults.  

We see Judy Hopps struggle with her own bias as she befriends and collaborates with Nick Wilde.  She seems to not recognize this as an issue for herself, ignoring her parents' fears of the city and the foxes therein.  She even tries to overcompensate for her species' general dislike of foxes, standing up for Nick Wilde when he faces discrimination and then buying the Jumbo Pop once he claims to have lost his money.  Only later when she presents her theory on the biological basis behind predatory species reverting to violence, and subsequently hurting Wilde, does she realize the extent of her own bias beliefs.

By presenting this story with animal characters, the audience is forced to confront their own beliefs.  Nothing about rabbits being fearful of foxes seemed offensive or shocking, it's even humorous as they use prop gags with a fox repelling line of pepper spray and tasers.  Hopps' parents seem all the more lovable and quaint because of their fears of the city and warnings about predators.  Yet this is not untamed nature, this is Zootopia, a place founded upon a civil contract that animals of all types can coexist.  To hold such bias tears at the fabric of their society, particularly when it is used by figures of authority to create a climate of fear and oppress minorities.  The use of a muzzle as a means of control, stifling their speech is an effective metaphor that appears natural in an anthropomorphic setting.  Perhaps the most complex use of animal as metaphor comes in the form of Assistant Mayor Bellweather.  The antagonist being a sheep who seems docile and likeable, yet is eventually revealed to be a perpetrator in a conspiracy to instigate violence and seize further control through fear.  It begs the question, is her course of action the result of self-determination, or is she trapped in a paranoid belief system that justifies oppression by manifesting the very thing she fears? 

These themes are not anything I could have anticipated.  While there have been many children’s movies that have had dark elements and topical subjects, Zootopia pushed the boundaries of what they could include yes still function as a family movie.  It’s a buddy movie with messages about friendship, making mistakes, and forgiveness that are equally as important.  There were multiple intense, heart wrenching scenes that made the characters all the more human, or anthropomorphic as it were.  Zootopia is truly a gem that teaches some lessons we needed to hear. 
",48vhc8
d5zcbm5,That was pretty good.  I enjoyed it much more than Frozen and Big Hero 6. ,48vhc8
d0o5xa3,"I think people are going to over what is the saddest lesson here. Hopps learns the truth about Night Howlers from Bunnyburrow, a small hick town. The folks there treat the behavior of Night Howlers like it's common knowledge, but no one in Zootopia seems to be aware of it. The animals that went ""savage"" were never tested for eating Night Howlers, and a cure was developed after the case was resolved at the end of the film.
That's depressing in two ways. 

1) Night Howler psychosis might have been a known trauma but no medical advances were done until after the issue was sensationalized.

2) The small hick town is so detached from modern society/the big city that their issues aren't even on the world's radar and visa-versa. Sure, they have newspapers, but Judy's parents didn't seem at all interested in the predator case sweeping the city. And did Judy's relative that went crazy over Night Howlers ever get the proper treatment, or is he just trapped in the loony bin?",48vhc8
d0mzqna,"Well... I know the furries will love it.

In all seriousness, I was surprised by how dark this film was. It covers some really mature themes for a kids film- political corruption, racism [spoilers](#s ""State-enforced racism, even!""), fear of the police, drugs... it was kind of bizarre seeing a plot that wouldn't be out of place on CSI acted out by cartoon animals.

Even Judy isn't free from prejudice, which is refreshing to see in a main character- she keeps a bottle of what is essentially pepper spray by her side through most the movie, specifically formulated to work on foxes. She almost uses it when she first meets Nick, and [spoilers](#s ""Nick takes notice of this, and calls her out on it after she gives a press conference where she says that predators have a biological urge to be... well, predators. They have a small fight, and Nick almost gets her to pull the spray on him."") It's a heavy moment.

The movie doesn't try to hide that the world isn't perfect- it's impossible for harmony to exist at all times, and people are always going to marginalize and look down on you for what they think you can and can't do. Not everyone can be anything- there are always limiting factors in place, but we should try our damnedest to overcome them, whether it's a physical limitation or just how people look down on you.

Onto the technical side of things, the voice acting in this is spectacular- I started crying when Judy [spoilers](#s ""comes crawling to Nick, begging to be forgiven after she pretty much caused Zootopia to fall out of harmony due to implying predators- and only predators- can become 'savage'."") J.K. Simmons is on point as the mayor, Jason Bateman is hilarious as Nick, Idris Elba was friggin *awesome* as Chief Bogo, and after seeing Jenny Slate as Assistant Mayor Bellwether, I realized that she needs to be in more films. The characters look better here than they have in any Disney 3D film before.

One last thing: if you go into it, be prepared to invoke the MST3K Mantra at certain points- for instance, Nick's establishing scene includes a sequence at an ice cream parlor. It could be Gelato (which can be made with water), but now that I've gotten home, I find myself wondering where they got the milk. Ew.

On a related note, Nick and Judy are coming to Disney parks and... [AAAAAUUUUUGH!](https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2016/03/nick-wilde-and-judy-hopps-are-on-the-way-to-disney-parks-direct-from-disneys-zootopia/) They look terrifying! Jeez, Disney, you clearly know who your periphery demographic's gonna be, so maybe talk with someone who makes fursuits for a living? They know what makes anthropomorphic animals aesthetically pleasing, and could probably design all sorts of cool shit for the costumes- built-in cooling systems, blinking eyes, an articulated mouth, that kind of thing.",48vhc8
d1f1bvc,"Just saw this movie with little expectations. Absolutely loved every part of it, even the ""predictable"" twists of the story still played out in a creative way. I feel obligated to comment on this as to how it relates to a sequel. So if they're now partners, that would have to involve some cop/procedural/mystery-type plot. To fit in with the original's subtle/symbolic commentary on societal issues, the sequel's overarching mystery would likely have to include something like that as well. 

Combine all that with the growing relationship between the two main characters, the thing that jumped to mind was some form of kidnapping plot involving kids (maybe all predator, maybe all prey, maybe mixed) that also somehow ties in to the fact that Judy/Nick can't have them, interracial couples, adoptions/orphans, etc. Not sure if it'd be one high-priority kidnapping or systemic, but there are plenty of criminal/mystery plots that could be adapted to fit the world. Maybe one of them gets framed. Or they could just remake Chinatown.

You know what, the movie that just popped into my head is Gone Baby Gone. Something like that, where it again threatens to divide the whole city. And if they want to go off track and go full Empire Strikes Back, maybe it actually does divide it this time.",48vhc8

They even went to fine detail on things most people are never going to pick up on like 9 year old Judy still having baby teeth as evidenced by her only having the right front buck tooth at 9 and both of them when she's in the accademy.

On another note for some reason when I saw this Judy's line in the play ""Our ancestors first banded together and declared anyone can be anythiing."" made me think of Manny, Diego and Sid where the ancestors in question and their herd in ice age was what changed the course of history and resulted in Zootopia rather than a human controlled world.",48vhc8
d460vx4,"5/5 would see again.

For the people that haven't seen it: It's an awesome movie about a white girl joining the boys club to become a corrupt cop. The badass girl gets told she is cute and shuts that shit down real quick! Gotta teach the youngin's ya know?! She isn't happy with starting out as a meter maid, so she starts to plot on how to become famous. Her plan succeeds to blackmail a cute but sometimes scary black, verbally abusive, crook to do her bidding. Later she moves up in the world of corruption and starts to use the mafia to threaten weasels to get what she wants.

In the end it is shown that blacks weren't scary, it was all because of the cocaine. The crook, seeing the girls power, follows her footsteps. The corrupt girl falls in love with the crook.

d0o658m,"I also just learned that Judy's plight can also be taken from a feminist POV. I didn't associate her being called cute to women not being taken seriously because of their looks. Mind blown. I guess it also threw me off since, and I could be wrong about this, but wasn't the ""elephant"" in the room female? Though I guess even if she was, it's the stereotype of how women can't be ""feminine"" and do other things.

Also, I think the plight of taking the task of being a meter maid too seriously was another harsh truth. Judy should've taken it down a peg with providing tickets, but it's a tough and underappreciated job, especially since sometimes overdue parking can be a major issue, especially in crowded areas. They could've even gone into quotas the police officers have to make for one reason or another.",48vhc8

d15nlyc,"Just got back myself, amazing movie! Solid 9/10. Animation and art style was incredible, characters were well-fleshed out and some had good on-screen chemistry, plot was decent (actually got me in the end), some surprising adult themes and jokes were tackled too. I know its a Disney movie but I think it's fun to think about the world itself (maybe it's because I study biology). Some thoughts on that:

Domestication doesn't seem to occur as there's no humans (although some of the pigs and sheep looked like domestic breeds, but it's hard to be sure). I know they really only showcased 'classic' mammals (and I'm impressed at the number shown) but I was also surprised at the lack of primates. Perhaps they removed primates completely in this universe so that humans weren't an option? 

Other thoughts include the ecosystems in Zootopia: there's meant to be twelve and we got to see 3-4. I wonder if there's a coastal ecosystem for our marine mammal friends, and a cave ecosystem for bats? I also found it interesting that the town outside of Zootopia seem more afraid of predators (since Zootopia was created for predators and prey to live in peace). Do rural areas differ in predation? 

What do predators eat? They've got a lot of human-based foods obviously but there's a bit of talk about predation being in the 'biology,' so carnivores would have to satisfy that in some way. Maybe they make meat substitutes in Zootopia? Not impossible!

Finally, how do the other major animal groups play into this (fish, birds, reptiles and amphibians, invertebrates)? We could see flies and a fish market were in the movie, so they exist, but are they 'sentient?' Do these groups have their own Utopias? What would happen if these Utopias met? How would the predation hierarchy shift?

Goodness this movie was done so well and so fun to think about. Left wanting more from the world and some of the characters too. Lots of potential to explore, would be cool if they brought out an Ecyclopedia or something.

d0qj01x,"I absolutely adored this movie. I went into it thinking the previews only looked decent, and it would be sort of a middle-of-the-line Disney movie, but I went to see it because I love Disney movies. I came out surprised at how it was probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in awhile (along with Deadpool, go figure) and how smart and adult-directed the jokes and messages were.

Everyone keeps talking about how the theme was specifically race relations and prejudice, but I thought there might have also been some symbolism regarding mental health issues with the savagery of the animals and it being ""biologically ingrained"" in their DNA. Just my take.

I'm also really glad that they didn't pair Nick and Judy as a romantic couple. I had some fear they were going to go for the tried trope of the two eventually falling in love, and I thought the movie was much, much better for them having not done that.

The movie also had probably some of the prettiest and most amazing imagery I've seen in any Disney movie. They truly did an incredible job setting up the backdrop and the world.

Also, I feel like a sequel is inevitable. The way they set up the ending, it seems like it just begging to be continued.

I always had a slight problem with most animated movies in that they are usually so fast paced and so low on actual plot/story that they usually feel like just bigger episodes of your regular cartoons. Zootopia, on the other hand, works as a good film.

I've been hyped for this movie since early 2013, when it was just announced and never have I ever thought it's gonna be this good. I loved everything about it and it pretty much sets the new bar of quality of both visuals and storytelling in animation. I really like WDAS' previous cgi movies, like BH6, Frozen, Tangled and such, but they feel like slightly awkward tries and experiments, with Zootopia being a product of all that effort, a finally realized potential.

The thing that bummed me down most after watching this movie is returning to a bleak real world. Zootopia is just a beautiful place and it's realized brilliantly. The worldbuilding is just insane, I'd love to just go through the movie frame by frame and see everything, that's how detailed it is. I wish the movie stopped more often and just allowed us to look around more. All this seriously reminded me of Avatar with its Pandora, the place that makes the real world just look boring.

I adore both main characters. Judy is instantly likeable and Nick, while being an embodiment of a stereotypical ""sly fox"" is great, too. Charming rogue and an underdog are my favorite types of character because of how relatable and interesting they are. Couldn't get enough of these two. Especially Judy, she's cute and a great role model. I think she'll be everybody's favorite, but Nick is no supporting character either.

The story was pretty simple, it pretty much hits every checkbox as far as buddycop movies go. Still, it was done nicely and kept the pace going, plus I didn't expect some of the twists and turns, it was widly (heh) entertaining, especially because this type of story naturally allows for a lot of travel and this just couldn't work better for this beautiful city. The timeless message of prejudice and such were handled very well and the perspective of animals on all of this is fresh and fascinating. It was pretty heartbreaking at times, too.

Visuals were just so, so good. I thought The Good Dinosaur and Big Hero 6 looked splendid, but neither had creativity or visual splendor and variety of Zootopia. The scene with Judy arriving on a train is just breathtaking. The music by Michael Giacchino wasn't especially noticeable, but it worked as a score well enough, I should give it a listen outside of the movie. Try Everything by Shakira is great and works awesome as an intro and ending.

Anyway, now I want to see more adventures of Nick and Judy in this city and I hope this movie will be successful enough to make a sequel happen. Disney's been on the roll since Tangled and I think their movies now are better than ever and Zootopia sits on top of this food chain :) Now I just hope that Moana will be at least half as good. The only thing I didn't like as much is Russian dub. It worked well for the most part, but sometimes the emotions of voices didn't match well to the facial expressions and some text, like billboards and such, was translated but not all of it and can appear translated in one scene and in English in another. I probably need to watch it few more times to formulate a proper opinion, but I can't really say anything bad about it. It's everything I expected it to be and more.

TL;DR Loved it a lot, will watch it again.

d0qdq4q,"I LOVED it. It hit on all cylinders for me. Two things stood out - I was very impressed that Disney was able to address the racial divide (and bigotry in general) in such a natural way, so that everyone could understand it. There's plenty of grown adults out there who don't understand privilege and opression, so anything that can break it down for kids is great in my book. Second, it seemed to be made in the spirit of the Disney Afternoon cartoons - DuckTales, TaleSpin, Rescue Rangers, etc. Disney hasn't gone to that well in a while, so it was gratifying. Honestly, not even halfway through the movie I was praying for a Zootopia TV series that would follow Judy and Nick on the beat.",48vhc8

This allegedly happened during the Reagan administration and Reagan didn't know anything about it, much like how the lion didn't know anything about the lamb intoxicating predators with what is clearly supposed to be a drug that makes them look bad. The lion, like Reagan, was looked at as a hero with few faults while Oliver North has been looked at as a criminal for doing such a thing. Coincidence or not this is just one of the many things I noticed about the movie.",48vhc8
d0ntyyy,"In terms of storytelling and animation, it's right up there in quality with their recent releases but I was not expecting a Disney film to approach this level of substance with as much grace as it has. It reminded of how [Dr. Suess' ""The Sneetches""](https://youtu.be/PdLPe7XjdKc) explored discrimination through cartoon. 

[I enjoy reading about the amount of detail involved in their process:](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-zootopia-production-20160304-story.html)
> The filmmakers brought in an array of experts as they designed the world, from zoologists, who advised on how each species should move, to specialists on the Americans With Disabilities Act, who helped construct a city where a 2-inch character and a 27-foot character could coexist, to HVAC system designers, who puzzled over how to build a tundra neighborhood next to a desert one.
> 
> Female police officers spoke with the filmmakers about challenges they faced — including having trouble finding male officers willing to partner with them. In the case of Judy Hopps, who also faces difficulty being taken seriously as a police officer, animators used small scale to dramatize her struggle, as she struggled to hop up on a chair in the police department.

> ""We go more species-ist rather than gender-based,"" said Howard. ""The fact that Judy is actually struggling against this is pretty relatable for a lot of people.",48vhc8

d0numq1,"I went into this film thinking it would be a solid B grade type movie like Big Hero Six, Frozen, etc. But I was quickly proven wrong. I loved how this movie took its time at the beginning to develop Judy. Most films would just blast through scene to scene to get to the action. The writing here was impeccable, the animation incredible, and the world building was breathtaking. The amount of thought put into what would normally be considered throwaway details, such as handing a giraffe a drink at a shop, was amazing. I know I would need to watch it again because there's so many little details like parody billboards and businesses in the background. I can't even think of enough positive adjectives to describe this film -- it's pretty much as close to the high end Pixar tier that Disney has ever come. 

The premise of a Bunny Cop surviving in the big city alone was interesting enough to drive the story, and then they kept adding layers to it. I also appreciated how there wasn't a major protagonist throughout most of the film, it was society and prejudice that was our villain. I felt that this is by far the funniest Disney film of recent memory. I appreciate that it respects that children can handle such a complex and maybe even scary story. It didn't need fart jokes to keep the audience's attention and they knew it. 

One thing I felt was a little weak was the main song. It just felt on the level of typical pop to me. It's a forgettable track for a company known for releasing animated films with memorable songs.",48vhc8
d0tzvre,"Zootopia: bring on the furries

This film was smart. It used everything very well. Targeting issues that are present in society in a creative and entertaining fashion.

Acting: great, chemistry was perfect. Visuals were brilliant and beautiful. Soundtrack was what you would expect from an animation, great for the tones. The story, while predictable, was done very well as it was witty, contained great humor, had hilarious references, and was smart with what they did.

Rating: 9/10 (the missus says it's more of a 9.4)

Watchability: multiple times.

The humour was brilliant and some of the scenes (Mr Big's scenes, ""Walter & Jesse are at the door."" and the end joke with Flash) are comedy gold.

d0sw9iq,"I honestly don't understand the criticism of the overall message being heavy handed. Its not like I totally disagree that it was obvious, but it is a movie aimed at children primarily, *of course* its going to make the message easy to get. It doesn't treat the audience, children or adults, like they are stupid however and it does a great job of appealing to more than just children so I see no reason to criticize the fact that the parallels were easy to draw.

My only real complaints of the film were the soundtrack which was good but nothing all that memorable, and that I think *spoilers* the discovery of the reason why predators were going savage was a bit too convenient. 

Neither of those issues stop it from being a great film. I think it was quite a bit better than both Frozen and Big Hero 6, I do hope for a sequel just because I love the world of it. ",48vhc8
d0mwexk,"Obviously top notch animation, solid soundtrack and voice acting, and a surprisingly non-cliche plot.

d0n56dw,"I really enjoyed this movie. Plan on going to see it again tomorrow or Saturday (in part because I ended up with a free ticket voicher due to the theatre accidently playing the 2D version instead of the 3D).
The movie looked gorgeous and I really liked the details they had even for some of the characters. Nick's background story got to me a little bit, and I nearly teared up. I'll probably be in the minority on this, but I actually liked Bellwether a lot. 

And as someone that didn't really care too much for the Flash character before seeing the movie, I gotta admit that his scenes cracked me up. I admit that I thought he'd be annoying to due to how ""hyped""(?) the commercials has him out to be, if that made sense. 

I totally want to see a sequel for this, be it a movie or a TV show.

Throughout the movie the only couples you ever see together are of the same species, whether it be the shrew(or vole?) who is getting married, Judy's parents, or the ottertons. This builds up the concept that the species only form romantic relationships with those of the same species. So they will probably have the inter-species relationship be as controversial or even more controversial to the citizens of zootopia than gay couples/ inter-racial couples were to many Americans in the 50's and 60's.

I am so happy to see the movie, it is THE BEST disney movie ever after Lion King, much much better than Frozen or most Pixar's film in the past 5 years...

Haven't seen a funny yet educational yet fluently done movie in such a long time. This is a brave movie, it tackles race/stereotype theme with so much more guts, shadowing most of serious live action movies. The idea to talk those sensitive issues through animation is BRILLIANT!! It is not forced, it is very well articulate.

d0myqex,"Okay, so I really enjoyed Zootopia, and this might sound tinfoily, but I have a theory that this movie is a metaphor for the conspiracy theory that crack-cocaine was engineered by the government and distributed to poor urban areas in an attempt to destroy minority communities. Repost from /r/fantheories follows... 

The film starts out introducing us to the world of ""Zootopia,"" a land in which animals have evolved to the point that they form a society that functions in much the same way as our own. We learn that both predators and prey live together in relative harmony. We are then introduced Judy Hopps, a bunny that becomes a police officer, and her first day on the job leads her on a missing persons (otters?) case, where we learn that certain species of predators are going feral and attacking other animals. When news of this breaks, it leads to mistrust between predators (The minority, who make up 10% of the overall population) and prey (The majority, who make up 90%). Later we find out that the reason the predators have been going crazy is because the deputy-turned-actual mayor of Zootopia has been involved in a plot to manufacture a drug that causes animals to revert to their primal state in an attempt destroy the predator community.

I think that's eerily similar to the commonly circulated conspiracy theory regarding the invention of crack-cocaine. A lot of people believe that crack was manufactured by the US government and distributed to poor urban areas in an attempt to tear apart the black community. The parallels are so clear it almost seems like that was the literally the filmmakers intent.",48vhc8

d0o0nx1,"I enjoyed it quite a bit.

I went into it with a bit of apprehension because I had heard synopsis online that said it was thematically a film about prejudice and inequality. I went into the theater pretty much expecting it to just be another ""white guilt"" movie where the evil white-analog oppressor group is shown the error of their ways by the plucky minority-analog protagonist and learns to treat everyone as equals, but it surprisingly did a pretty good job of showing that *everyone* can be prejudiced and *everyone* needs to stop stereotyping others based on external characteristics. From the start, I was basically playing ""spot the white representative"", but by the end of the movie my idea of who the ""bad guys"" we're had flipped about a half dozen times.

At first it seemed like the bunnies were supposed to be the discriminated group with the main character being told it's impossible for rabbits to be police officers, but then Judy meets Nick and it seems like it's foxes who are actually the discriminated group, and then it seems like the prey species are the ones being discriminated against by the predator species, but then it's revealed that the predators only make up 10% of the population and the prey species discriminate against *them*...and so on.

I went into it expecting to be guilt-tripped, but instead it was just a good mystery movie with a subplot about everyone being kinda shitty to everyone and maybe people should try not to be.

The animation was also fantastic. About the only thing that was kind of a let-down was the soundtrack. Aside from the end credits song which I was humming on my drive home (which I've already forgotten an hour and a half later), I can't really say there was *any* stand-out music. In fact, there was barely any music at all. There was the end credits and I recall a song playing while Judy was on her first trip to the city, but aside from that I don't think there was anything. Kinda weird since Big Hero 6 and Wreck-It Ralph each had a bunch of memorable songs for me.",48vhc8

I loved the movie but felt that the climax ended abruptly. We just got introduced to blueberries and didn't hear about them for the entire film. So when they switched the blueberries out for the night howler pellets, it didn't sit right with me.

If they had made a small mention of how Judy's family grows carrots AND blueberries, throughout the film, then the reveal would've landed harder, IMO.

Like ""Judy you can just be a carrot farmer."" ""Don't forget blueberries!"" or something along that line.

Instead it felt forced and as if they had come up with the ending at the very end and retconned the whole thing to be about blueberries. Hell, the Fox Spray should've come back into play instead of just being what Nick brought up during their fight.

Overall, the movie was great but I wanted the ending to stick harder. They brought the ""blood, blood, blood"" line back, could've done it better with the blueberries.",48vhc8

d0n1sa0,"My review taken from my [blog](https://themoviecafe.wordpress.com/2016/03/04/zootopia-review/):

Walt Disney Animation Studios is giving Pixar a run for it’s money.


I didn’t know much about Zootopia when I went to go see it. I knew the general setting, a world populated by intelligent animals. I knew the film was produced by the same animation studio that brought us Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, and Big Hero 6, and I knew Jason Bateman played a fox in the film. That was about it. What I didn’t know was that this film’s primary focus was topically covering race relations in a family friendly setting, delivered through a noir-lite buddy cop story. The movie had a lot of ground to cover, and it pulls it off exceptionally. I loved this movie.

I already went in with pretty high hopes. I loved Wreck-It Ralph and really enjoyed Big Hero 6,  so I was expecting a lot from this studio’s next venture. That being said, Zootopia still greatly exceeded my expectations and is now my favorite film Walt Disney Animation Studios has produced in recent years. The film is just so smart and witty and mature, at times I forgot I was watching a movie meant for kids.

Zootopia tells the story of Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a rabbit who movies to the metropolis of Zootopia, a city seperated into various biome districts where predators and prey live together in harmony, in hopes of becoming a cop. Eventually she gets wrapped up in a kidnapping mystery, and has to employ the help of the sly fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). The relationship between these two characters is the classic odd couple, the bickering buddy cop team. This dynamic is played fairly straight throughout the film but helps give legitimacy to its noir influenced story. The chemistry between Judy and Nick is great and doesn’t feel forced at all, and I really bought into their friendship/partnership.

In the opening act of the movie, Zootopia already begins tackling issues of casual racism, personifying this struggle through the distrust between various species of animals, citing their nature, etc. It’s effective due to the the ridiculous and humorous approach that the filmmakers took with this theme. By showcasing racism through different species of animals, it really shined a light on how absurd the concept really is. One joke I thought was pretty clever deals with Judy getting hired to be a cop through affirmative action. Its jokes like this one that really help deliver on the overall message of the film, promoting open mindedness and acceptance.

The fact the film is able to deal in themes such as this within the constructs of an animated family comedy just shows the strength of the writing team. The writing of this film is extremely sharp and witty, the film is hilarious and I was constantly laughing throughout. The plot is well thought out, if a little predictable. The film unfortunately falls back on a similar trope for it’s villain as Big Hero 6 and Wreck-It Ralph did. But other than the over familiarity in the plot, all of the characters are well rounded and the two leads in Judy and Nick both have tremendous character development throughout the film. All of the characters have notable flaws, but that just helps make them feel more believable and endearing.

The humor in the film takes full advantage of its setting. Their is a lot of great subtle visual humor in the film, just showing the various animals living day to day life in Zootopia. There are a variety of interlaced pop culture jokes, referencing things such as The Godfather, Breaking Bad, and Frozen. The film utilizes and plays off these references well, and really add to the film instead of taking away from it, which could have easily happened.

The animation in this film is extremely well done. All of the animals move realistically and are able to emote very well, which just makes the film all the more immersive. The city of Zootopia is just plain eye candy. Every thing in the city is designed with a purpose and I just wanted to spend more time in the city, exploring all the different districts. I loved the general look of the film and the animation quality was top notch.

Overall, I enjoyed the hell out of Zootopia, a lot more than I was expecting to. What I expected to be a cute animated comedy ending up being a topical commentary on race relations while delivering a good message to adults and kids, told through a anthropomorphised animal noir story. The film is smart, funny, and heartfelt. I loved Zootopia .",48vhc8

d0qbqnc,Nakama power!!!!!!!!!,48vhc8
d0o1dss,"I'm probably gonna catch flak for this opinion but: Zootopia was decent and didn't live up to the hype. It was a thriller that could have and should have been done better by a company that in part owns Pixar.

Now I know it's a Disney movie and is geared towards kids, but what I didn't think was accomplished was how they turned all those things into a larger package. The world was fleshed out and made sense yet **some** of the characters that inhabited that world felt arbitrarily placed and only served a single purpose in the entire film. I liked the themes of racism and fear of others was done well and accomplished it's goal and I liked how they tackled the entire concept in a clever way. 

But at the end of the day, Zootopia is a suspense thriller that felt like I ordered a cherry coke and was instead handed diet. Someone substituted thriller-lite for my chicken parm. The film has a problem that is also a mystery, an unlikely hero to solve that problem, a road block  to solve the problem, a conclusion that doesn't solve the mystery and the eventual conclusion to the entire thing. But with every conclusion the film arrived at left me feeling like the filmmakers took the easy way out and never really nailed down the true feeling of a good thriller movie like Seven, Memento or Identity.

I really wanted to see more action-reaction to everything that occurred in the film and see more character development that led me to connect better the others characters in the film. Outside of the main characters, who I only ever connected with because of the short glimpse into Judy and Nick's past, I didn't quite feel like the rest of the cast meant anything.

[Story Spoilers](#s ""Concerning the story: I felt like everything up to entering the facility where the rapid animals were being held was successful. Characters were introduced and used to reach a goal that made sense. Even entering facility was done in a clever and meaningful way and helped the viewer connect to both Judy and Nick that brought them closer together. The two had already avoided death once and came out on top, Judy getting the pair into the facility only made that connection stronger. But this is where the movie hopped on the ""taking the easy way out"" train. I think once they got trapped inside the facility the film maker should have heralded back to the boxing and ticket placement sequences from earlier and had Judy face off against one of the timber wolves. She knows how to fight a target bigger than her and she has crazy good hearing, so why didn't we ever see that used again? It felt like the two sequences from earlier were just thrown in there and never gotten back to again. I wanted to see Nick hurt or incapacitated in some way and Judy had to step up and defend him like the cop she is. I wanted to see her be a real hero instead of just handing her the win every time."")

[Continuation of Spoilers](#s ""The press conference was a nice action-reaction, but I felt like instead of the short montage of predator hate that we got, we should instead have gotten something more akin to The Dark Knight Rises sequences in which the city is then gripped by fear. Citizens would close their shops and force predators out (like the ice cream guy does in the beginning of the movie) and deny them service. I felt like we should have seen a transition from a peaceful and happy city where animals co-existed to a city gripped by fear and paranoia."")

[Even more spoilers](#s ""Solving the real mystery also felt like a cop out. Judy wasn't on that farm, selling carrots for no more than five minutes before she is handed the answer by her old nemesis for free. The fuck? Really? You're not even going to make them work for it? That's just lazy story-telling. I would rather have seen something akin to the way Hot Fuzz did things and had the main character go through a serious transition where they left in disgrace while feeling terrible. Judy could have ended up at back at home, selling carrots and being around her parents while never really felling truly accomplished only to eventually end up meeting that fox baker again by chance. They could have had words and that same conversation could have taken place, but only after Judy went through a lot of emotional shit. Then once Judy figures it all out she zooms off to save the day and returns to find Zootopia in chaos where she eventually, after asking around, finally finds that Fennec con-artist whose name we never find out and he, without asking anything in return, informs her of Nick's location. Really? That con artist isn't going to ask for anything in return? He isn't even going to degrade her for being some let down of a cop who walked out in disgrace after throwing the city into a panic. Like come on. Give me a reason to connect with this guy other than a shitty elephant costume."")

[HE'S A SPOILER JIM!](#s ""I think everything including the train sequence and beyond to the end was done well and finished out the story nicely. What I would have loved to see though was a thread through the entire film as to who the actual villain really was. You saw that sheep only a handful of times through the entire film, yet there was never any real inclination that she could have been the bad guy. The filmmakers didn't even throw in one of those cheesy shadow-silhouette bad guy scenes to really highlight this person working from the shadows to set everything up. I think the villain reveal at the end would have been much stronger if you were only getting subtle clues through the entire film as to who the real perp was. She's also a pretty weak villain because how the fuck does she know all these things anyway?"")

[IT'S THE SOUND OF SPOILERS](#s ""How does this sheep really know about these flowers anyway? I can understand why Judy knows about them - she's from a family of farmers and the study of plant life was even highlighted in some of her dialog. But the sheep? Fuck if I know. Was she some random sheep who found out about this flower by reading a magazine? Was she told by someone? Did she have past experience? Was she a farmer from a small town as well? Was she the failed Judy Hopps? Did she come to Zootopia from a farming family in another burrow with the same dreams and aspirations as Judy but they were never fully realized and she ended up being an assistant for that Lion mayor? Did she have pent up rage from all this failure and only connected with Judy because of her upbringing and her species? What if she used Judy through the entire film to achieve her own goals - like having the mayor arrested? What if the sheep was dropping hints (like the joker did for Batman in The Dark Knight) and leading Judy to her eventual goal? All of these questions go unanswered and it's a huge letdown because that villain could have been so much stronger. Hell, they could had the two duke it out at the end once Judy trumps her only for Judy to lose and eventually have the whole Wild Nick acting scene occur. On that note - who the fuck plans to get captured? Why did they pull that ammo out of that gun in the first place? How did they know they were going to get captured? Why not just take it straight to HQ and be done with it? Who the fuck carries around a bio-weapon in their pocket like it's a chocolate bar?"")

Overall the entire film felt lazy and half-assed and while I understand it's a kids movie, so was Big Hero 6 and Wreck-It Ralph, it could have been done so much better. Sorry for all the spoiler tags, I know this looks like something requested from the CIA, but I didn't want to ruin anyone's viewing experience!

Also they rode Shakira hard on that marketing train. That last sequence was bleh.",48vhc8
d0mxxeg,"I loved it. Probably one of my early favorites of 2016. It's an adorable kids movie with cute, talking animals and it's a surprisingly heartfelt adult movie about breaking down class and gender stereotypes. Disney animation's hot streak continues.",48vhc8
d3dvyte,I love evrything about it!,48vhc8
d0wr276,"I've said this since he hosted SNL, but Jason Bateman is not a fantastic comedic actor. He's great when playing a straight-man role, which he is usually type-casted as, and while he did bring some to life to his part in this film, I feel there were definitely better actors who could have fit in the role. It obviously didn't ruin the film for me, it was just one of my major gripes.",48vhc8
d0ooesy,"I'll probably get shit on, but I didn't find Zootopia to be as good as everyone says it is. I don't know why. I always feel that Disney films are pretty even in terms of being a kids/adult film. I agree with most on here saying the sloth scene was the funniest scene in the entire film and I probably laughed 2 or 3 times more, but that's it. 

It definitely has a good message for kids. I'm sure kids will love the film and it's a good film for kids, but as an adult, I felt it was a little flat. I always think of Wreck It Ralph and Big Hero 6, where I felt those to be an even split where adults could actually enjoy it. ",48vhc8
d0p95iy,"I'm in the minority here, but I didn't really like it, and I'm not sure if it's just because I'm to old for this movie.

The overarching message is ""don't treat people as stereotypes!"" when only a few characters actually do that. Guess what the only weasel's only characteristic is? He's a weasel! Foxes are sly! Bunnies are timid! I have no idea why all the people are going mad over the race part of the story. Anti-discrimination themes are in every animated movie. Dumbo, Mulan, Wreck-It Ralph, Ratatouille, Inside Out...

The character's decisions and reactions don't make any sense. The best example of this is at the press conference scene. Nick is somehow shocked and appalled at Judy saying that the craziness seems to be a biological thing that only affects predators, even though she said that using the evidence she collected WHILE HE WAS THERE. This isn't news to him, he heard it too. When explaining herself, Hopps says that ""It's not like a bunny could go savage"" in a strangely condescending tone that goes against the previous hour of character development. Then he makes a mock ""I'm a killer too!"" face and for some goddamned reason Judy actually believes he's serious, despite trusting him enough to give him a fucking application to the force. Then, he gets huffy about the fox repellent, and in true romantic comedy fashion, Judy sputters about it instead of simply saying ""my racist parents gave it to me.""

Bonus points awarded to the ending conflict basically being the same as the Power Ranger Movie's, with a mind controlled good guy attacking a non-controlled good guy. I'm certain that the ""I'm faking being mind-controlled"" thing has been used in another animated movie before, but the title escapes me.

All in all, I found the movie just frustrating. It was funny, sure, but the events that move the actual plot forward are poorly done, in my opinion. Points I liked about the movie:

* Animal jokes were consistently funny. ""Rabbits are good at multiplying"" being the standout.

* The Mr. Big Vito Corleone scene was absolute gold

* Poor ol' JK Simmons and Shakira did so much with what few lines they got to work with.

* Some of the best animation I've seen in a movie.

d0mwrlb,"Here's my Five Sentence Review:

Zootopia is a fun kids movie with a simple plot, an effective cast, a lot of heart, and a good message. I think we are in a golden age of kids movies in many ways, from DreamWorks franchises like Kung Fu Panda, Pixar films, and now these off shoot Pixar-lite Disney films. While they may not hold the weight and effectiveness of a Pixar led Disney animated feature, these other films still have a lot of the heart and laughs of a traditional Pixar film. Although this movie does suffer from a couple of slow parts, it features wonderful connections that adults can laugh at without being inappropriate for kids, and it has several references to different genres of cop movies (which I was a big fan of). This is the perfect movie for the family and while it may not be a classic, it will most likely stand out as one of the top 2 or 3 kids movies of the year.

I give Zootopia a B+",48vhc8
d0my3qf,"Am I the only one who was underwhelmed? I didn't hate it by any means, but didn't think it was as perfect as people are making it seem. The writing wasn't as clever as I'd hope it to be, and there were a few plot holes that really bothered me, when usually, plot holes go over my head. ",48vhc8
d0q794t,"OK I guess this gonna get downvoted as fuck but it's really kind of outofmychest stuff.
1st of all, I'm not even American but live in US.

Long in short, the movie carries better (IMHO) theme/idea than some tradition animations, but I just can't deal with the artificial/manipulated political correctness, maybe just because I'm a jerk wearing glasses.

I was considering this movie will be widely watched by kids and has its educational effect. I question whether the idea could be spread in a good manner. We all fucking know the problem is not BIOLOGY although it underlies the cover of colors/religions. We need to get to the core of problems, not faking another problem then concur to distract the real one.

Besides, the conspiracy of the story line makes me feel it's an intended-to-do so analogy. These days US got color problems, Europe has refugee/religion problems. But strongly build the story on the assumption that predator gets better and their inherent nature won't be triggered bothers me, so does the classification of predators and others.

Overall, technically it's great at least 9/10; story telling, awesome; main idea trying to be conveyed, great; but I'm not a fan of how it's so constructed.

I'm not quite sure what I'm talking about, it's really the first time I have so much mixed/weird feeling after watching an animation film. ",48vhc8

I didn't like the heavy handed message either.  It didn't make a lot of sense.  It's not like the predators were a beaten down part of society, the lion was the mayor and everything.  It was an alright movie, but I guess I expected more funny.",48vhc8
d1ste5n,"Could Disney have predicted the Brussels train bombing when they showed explosions in the subway?  There was clearly a lot of themes that tied into not looking at groups as a whole, for example, not thinking all Muslims are terrorists. Disney could actually be doing the right thing and trying to make radial discrimination a smaller problem, making LGBT discrimination obsolete  (the scene where the elephant doesn't allow the fox service and the ""little fox just wants to be an elephant""), but Disney could also be working woth ISIS to make Americans not fearful of any Muslims, only afraid of being viewed as racist, prejudice, or politically incorrect.

d0oyodl,"I didn't hate the movie and laughed at some individual scenes, but I had a problem with the premise. It was never really explained and didn't make sense to me. What are the predators eating? How are they staying alive? They show the Fox eating blueberries once, but foxes can't live on berries, they have to eat meat. So do lions and wolves, etc. So what do they eat? They never answered that question and I couldn't get past it.

Also, they do show animals eating ice cream, which means they have to be getting milk somewhere, which means cows in this universe would have to be slaves.


Another thing is that I didn't like the message that anybody can be anything. That is not really true. I can't play in the NBA or be an astronaut or be a theoretical physicist. That's not about prejudice or discrimination. Individuals simply do not all have the same abilities. The general message about bigotry and unconscious prejudice was good, but what's true on a macro level is not necessarily true on a  micro level. For example, recognizing that gender is not a barrier to becoming a doctor does not mean that all women are therefore capable of being doctors. 

The movie even steps on its own message a couple if times by preaching against stereotypes and against making assumptions about ""biology,"" but then it has scenes of animals behaving in stereotypical, biologically programmed ways for laughs (the sloths, the wolves trying not to howl).

It sounds like I hated the movie, which I didn't, but I wish it had been tightened up a little bit on the premise.",48vhc8
d0s797z,"Absolutely loved this movie. It was way better than all the recent cartoons like Finding Nemo, Frozen, Toy story etc. Not only was it visually beautiful, it had lovable characters, genuine subtle romance, an excellent, fresh new world, a sense of realism of the struggles and mistakes of real life, along with a great sense of adventure.

To all the people complaining the movie was too politically correct:

* The movie itself was racist. Think about it. 99% of the rabbits in the movie stuck to their stereotypes. May of the racial depictions were extremely negative as well, such as for the lemmings and hippos. (blindly conformist / fat, lazy and selfish respectively).

Also:

*****SPOILER ALERT*******


The assistant mayor at the end starts going off with her speech about why ""they"" (the government) were needing to make the public fearful of ""predators"" (Blacks and Muslims) so that the majority (who she said were the 90%) would fear the 10% (predators) and keep the 90% dependent on the ""them"" (the government)?

It also pushed the bullcrap myth that the (government) was/is responsible for pushing the drugs (nighthowlers) into the predators (Blacks) so that it would keep them as savages and keep the 90% fearful and reliant on the government.

Very similiar to the bullcrap they say how the government ""purposely"" introduced Crack into the black community for supposedly the same reason. <gag>
Pullleeeasssse. Come on John Lasseter.... You're better than this.

Another thing... If the predators (and foxes too) keep doing things to make the ""prey"" fearful.... The ""prey"" has EVERY right to keep it's guard up EVEN THOUGH the majority of ""predators"" are non-violent and good.

I'm done.... there's way more to this than I have time for.

That's so true! At times I was worried that a lot of the lines were *too* smart, in the sense that they were things only some adults would get.

I quite liked this about her. I love female leads in films generally, but sometimes I feel like writers try too hard to make them fit into what they think a protagonist should be and basically write a very stereotypical male character as a female. I'm glad there were so many aspects to Judy's personality. Of course there were some tropes, but all characters have them, and her's were done nicely. I think it's one reason characters like her and Nick felt so real.

> 3) I love what they did with Gideon, the bully fox from the beginning. I know so many people who turned out like that.

Exactly! I was thinking that when I came out of the movie today. One peer of mine told me of issues he had with this one neighborhood kid he grew up with. They grew up in a medium-sized town, and he left after college to go find work. Went back home and found out the former kid is now working for his parent's business, is quite a nice fellow.

Then again it is up to Judy herself to consciously reject such indoctrination, or did she not try hard enough at doing that? Should Judy or the society take the blame?

The animals that went ""savage"" were never tested for eating Night Howlers, and a cure was developed *after* the case was resolved at the end of the film.

That's depressing in two ways.

1) Night Howler psychosis might have been a known trauma but no medical advances were done until after the issue was sensationalized.

2) The small hick town is so detached from modern society/the big city that their issues aren't even on the world's radar and visa-versa. Sure, they have newspapers, but Judy's parents didn't seem at all interested in the predator case sweeping the city.

At first it felt very forced and even preachy for a Disney-film (I cringed through the whole ""who should use the term cute""-discussion), but that was before it set all the pawns on the table it was going to use. After the first half of the movie, it had really muddled and mixed all the allegories so it's pretty much impossible to point any of them to one single issue. If you can use it's message as an example of pretty much any real-life situation, can you really say that it's meaning exactly what you took out of it? This is a positive thing I think because it goes deeper into the issue of prejudice, acceptance and fear. It even teaches the kids that you can do enormous harm in the name of good or justice. ^^Or ^^how ^^the ^^baddie ^^can ^^have ^^the ^^problem ^^glasses. 


If I would watch it a second time, I'd say that the beginning would go down better now that I know that the movie isn't going to the direction I expected it to be heading.


Overall I'd say the film is one of the strongest Disney animated-films in years, perhaps because they got to use the knowledge they got when they were still drawing the animals for their animations. The weak point of the film for me personally was Shakira and I wish the movie would've had more original and more memorable music.",48vhc8
d1dtfuu,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was exciting and funny.  But I don't think it was particularly well constructed in the sense that the climax and resolution all felt very vey rushed to me.  The twist was believable but it was rushed through, as was the aftermath.  Movie would have been tangibly better with 10 extra minutes.

Also, I felt they handled the message pretty well, but there were certain instances where it felt very heavy handed.

d0riss0,A native american? You must mean African American,48vhc8
d132nzk,"I think some parts of the metaphor get way, way darker when you substitute the animals with humans.

The Fox-Spray definitely has the real life implication of mace, and it makes the interaction between Judy and Nick really, really uncomfortable in the middle. It's like if at a special date, you realize that the girl you were dating was packing mace. I mean, I guess I can't technically blame her, but on the other hand, yeah, I do feel a bit put off by a lack of trust on her part.",48vhc8

d0pgirn,"I've always wanted to see a sequel to **Wreck-It Ralph** but I feel the writers and directors Phil Johnston, Rich Moore and Jennifer Lee really did one better with **Zootopia**.

In a lot of ways, the creative team explored a lot of similar themes in both, the idea of what your role in society is and jokes set in a world with very familiar but normalized rules.

As long as their movies stay as creative and smart, I can do without a sequel, just keep these same people together.",48vhc8
d0y3a1o,"That was my problem with this movie, it was too short",48vhc8
d0upi8y,"YES. I am absolutely blown away with the imagination that went into the different ecosystems. TundraTown, Rainforest District, I want to see them all!

d0okoje,"I looked at some of her other reviews. She rated Star Wars The Force Awakens rotten and on the same level as Fantastic Four. Also has rottens next to a bunch of other well-received movies like Creed.

Just a contrarian trolling for clicks. I guess it works, it got you to read the review and me to look at her other ones.",48vhc8
d0p2ir0,don't link to that review because some critics are noctorious for getting people to click on their reviews by writing angry click bate that doesn't make sense. they do it just to get visits on their page,48vhc8
d0nlq4i,"I think he's saying, the message of the movie is ""don't be racist, kids"", but some animals are natural predators or prey and can't live together, so the film is saying racism is an inherent human trait and can't be solved?

I haven't seen the movie yet but I'm gonna guess this guy's reading too much into it.",48vhc8
d0paikz,Is this guy trying to say racial harmony and biracial relationships are a bad thing?,48vhc8
d0o4b6c,I'm still not clear why she disliked this film. But fantastic trolling nonetheless ,48vhc8
d0q9a0l,Critic was probably paid by Fox.,48vhc8
d1fzck9,"I think it's saying that animal behavior they portray in the film ""prey/predator "" being the metaphor for race relations is bad. I enjoyed the movie a lot. Even loved it. But it has some truth to it. Prey and predator don't live peacefully in real life. ",48vhc8
d4fcsii,"I think what they're worried about is that the fact that they're all different species suggests that there really is an inherent difference between them, and that therefore it's irresponsible to compare different species with different races.  
They're suggesting that this metaphor for race is basically just as bad as using gorillas as a metaphor for black people.  

What this review completely misses though is that none of the different species in the movies actually fit a specific race/stereotype. (Except the Sloth government workers.)  
They're not dealing with any specific stereotypes, they're dealing with stereotypes in general.  
They also make it very clear that all of these different species have transcended beyond their savage pasts, so the implication that they're worried about, that they really are inherently different, is actually nonexistent.  

Mostly I think that the reviewer is just overthinking it and making it more complicated than it needs to be.

I also think that the reviewer is in denial about their own furry sexuality, given how bothered they are about sexualized animals.  ",48vhc8
d16wyi8,"As a grown man I hate to admit it got to me.  I didn't cry, but I had the feels.  That chest head butt and pen grabbing part was perfect.  That felt so human.",48vhc8

d3pn1do,"It made me somewhat uncomfortable. Not in the way that overacting or bad writing do, but that dealing with that level and kind of emotional display just makes me shift a little. So it definitely came across as real.",48vhc8
d0pbno4,It could easily be turned into a tv series. ,48vhc8
d0n2mh1,"There's a blog I follow called Unshaved Mouse that reviewed every film in the Disney Canon before branching out into other films. The writer decided that rather than classify the movies by the old ""Golden Age/Silver Age/Etc"" categories, he'd invent his own based more on the different tones and styles the eras took on.

He calls this current age the ""Redemption Era"" (the 2000s era was the ""Lost Era"" because they couldn't seem to pick a tone or equal Pixar's output) because it features Disney doing a lot of subversions of their old formulas and lessons, and making a conscious decision to be more progressive, inclusive, self-aware, and mature. Basically, ""better"". 

Things like Tiana's lesson that working for what you want is better than wishing on a star, Frozen's ""You can't marry someone you just met"" and parallels to a coming-out story, Ralph's ""there's no one I'd rather be than me"", and so on. Zootopia is a pretty much perfect continuation of this trend. 

I'm so glad kids will grow up with movies like these.",48vhc8
d0q96gr,"You can thank John Lasseter and Bob Iger for that. They pretty much recreated a fresh cast of animators, writers, and production staff. 

Just think that a massive amount of sequels were going to be made, including Aristocats 2, were going to be made.

Plus, they bought out Star Wars and Marvel, which bring in tons of money and they don't suck!",48vhc8

d0n1mtb,Yeah I don't think any Disney movie will ever be unpredictable. ,48vhc8
d0ox5i4,"I think this twist worked better than others though because her motivation for being the villain fit with the themes and the world they'd built. From the very beginning she tells Judy her induction into the police force was a big win for the little people, something along those lines. It's not as though they just picked the most unlikely character to do an about face, Smellweather had been pushed around most of her life, just like Judy and Nick, and she just approached this adversity in a different way.

d0o2su9,"Gonna be honest, I went in expecting Yax to be the secret villain.",48vhc8
d15iafo,I feel dumb cause I was surprised she was the villain. I thought it was the mayor all along,48vhc8
d0o6aam,"I agree - I really enjoyed it, but wish the story wasn't quite as predictable. If you're going to through in a little twist, then I would prefer for it to be a little fresher, or maybe even none at all. Despite this, overall I was very impressed.",48vhc8
d16wvcq,"Maybe I'm just old but I have a hard time putting this above many of the classics of the 2D era.  I mean come on.

If you haven't seen all of those I think you need to reserve judgement.",48vhc8

d21ylqt,what i enjoyed most out of that is how they took into account the wind direction that gave nick away to the wolves.,48vhc8
d0od7zd,"The problem with that is that the quality of the animation (hair/fur especially) would be down or completely dead in TV format. Also, the movie stars who did the voices would have to be replaced... On the whole, it would feel like a completely different, less amazing universe.

Companies have tried going from successful 3D rendered movie to TV before, but the animation and voice acting dip is always too much. Instead of a lot of low-quality, poorly written, poorly cast content I would never enjoy or watch, it would be best if they just continued with movies.

I would just hope it's not *5 years* to continue this really fun universe. How about one every couple years? Forever?",48vhc8

So there's no single, simplistic lens to view the world through. Whether that's stereotypes or stereotypes-are-never-valid-you're-just-a-bigot. I loved that the villain had a perfectly understandable motive, and that it was mostly shown, not crammed down your throat. I love that both the protagonists were wrong about each other at times.

d0o7q57,"I'm not so sure about that assessment. I admit that her investigation had a great deal of luck involved, but it's luck as a result of one of her key strengths: she gives a shit. She cared about the father getting a treat for his son (fake as it was, it still counts) which led her to her first break in the case, she cared about making sure people (fauna?) didn't get hurt in her foot chase so the shrew lady came back into play, and the fact that she was example to her parents led them to partnering with that one other fox at the end who knew the colloquialism. 

It's most definitely *lucky* that those little karmic moments paid off for her, but that's just standard movie luck that comes with telling stories that should have wrap-around moments like these. And it all stemmed from the fact that she cares, which is her greatest strength (as corny as that is). ",48vhc8
d0odidg,">instead of playing to her strengths as a bunny

It's worth pointing out that she caught the weasel, who ended up being a huge lead later on. It played into her strengths--that rhino wasn't exactly equipped to chase him, and even if another cop did show up, none of the others were small and nimble enough to tiptoe through Rodentia like Judy did. She was the absolute best cop for that job, because of her size and speed. And if she hadn't done that, and saved the daughter of the crime boss, Mister Big wouldn't have spared her life later on, and helped her with her first big lead! So it's a doubly important ""bunny needed on the police force"" example. Also, you could argue her rural bunny family knowledge helped her piece together the last bits of the story (even if it did take her weeks to overhear the Night Howler bit by sheer luck--you have to admit, nobody in the city was piecing that together).

Honestly, I'd argue it was targeted at all levels of the audience. In a something for everyone appeal. 

>The second is the way to story was revealed to us. This movie is essentially a whodunit/whydunit mystery, and along the way Hopps and Nick find new pieces of evidence. The problem is that the audience never has a chance to figure it out for themselves.

I'll agree with this mostly, the only hint was the weasel stealing the flower bulbs, and your right nearly everything is explained immediately as it's discovered. The hand holding was a heavy. I feel like they could have shown blue stuff on the jag when they open the door, or something like that but they wanted to have the prejudice moment after the press conference.

d16xnab,"> Specifically, the film didn't do a good job convincing me that she should have felt guilty about dividing Zootopia. Clearly, what was dividing predators and prey was that animals were going savage; she was not the cause, she just discovered it

I agree that they didn't do a good job of explaining it, but it was logical to me.  Basically the way she framed it to the public planted a seed of mistrust.  She was basically saying predators are innately untrustworthy and dangerous and that was that framed the tone of the news coverage.  They should have made this more clear, but I think she was right that she fucked up. 
",48vhc8
d16w8dy,"Yeah, I definitely thought it was a bit weird that they had her decide to take all of the blame for dividing Utopia.  Though her character was trying to be non-prejudiced the whole movie and her prejudices came out in the press conference scene.  I think that was a big part of what she felt guilty about.  She also had just heard the Mayor saying he kept it secret for that very reason, so she made his fears come true by presenting the situation in the worst way possible.

I definitely agree that there should have been more clues to the actual solution to the mystery leading up to the reveal.  And it is one of those coincidence solutions that's a bit annoying, but this is also a very common trope.

The makeup scene I was alright with.  Sometimes all it takes is some ""absence make the heart grow fonder"" and a heartfelt apology.  It didn't feel unnatural to me.  And it was a very well done scene.

You also have to consider the movie is over 2 hours already.  Adding much more to the plot would have made this a very hefty Disney movie.  ",48vhc8

Overall I think the movie is great but it's more of a fun movie than a heartfelt one where you really feel the emotions of the main character(s).

I think the reason they look so bad in that picture is that the correct settings on the camera haven't been figured out yet. We have specific camera settings for not only where we are in the park, but what character(s) we are photographing. Some costumes react differently to certain settings/flashes. I think half of the problem here is bad lighting/settings.

I've been off the past few days, but when I go into work next week, I'm sure they'll have that figured out by then.

Disney *also* makes mascot costumes with internal cooling, and some  costumes have articulated mouths and blinking eyes as well. However, those are reserved for shows, like the Dream Along With Mickey show at Disney World's Magic Kingdom, or the show with Mickey on Buena Vista street at California Adventure. Edit: This is because the characters' lines are pre-recorded, and the mouths move along with the audio.

The main problem is voice. We can't have a Judy Hopps or Nick Wilde with articulated mouths because the voice inside the costume would not only be muffled, but not sound like the actual character.",48vhc8

As a police drama, it did not have a menagerie of multi-dimensional characters in a complex tapestry of violence and deceit like The Departed.  Despite Judy Hopps' frustration with the lack of recognition by her superior officers, the soul crushing daily routine and public disdain, and her eventual collaboration with criminal-mind Nick Wilde, she never falls into the downward spiral of alcoholism, drug addiction, abuse of power, and loss of identity as they abandon the ideals that separate cop from criminal as Harvey Keitel's character did in Bad Lieutenant.  Dare I even mention how Zootopia pales in comparison to Thin Blue Line or Making A Murderer when it comes to artful and investigative crime documentaries?

Yes, and sometimes people ARE stereotypes. There will always be people who live up to your worst expectations of them. Like Nick felt he might as well give in to. But the point was to not let those people color your perception of others.

>The character's decisions and reactions don't make any sense. 

I think this was fully intentional and brilliant, because it illustrates how often we can think ourselves above prejudice. I admit the scene with Judy explaining the evidence could have been a bit better written, but the scene just after was perfect. Judy has been the victim of prejudice, and believes she's above it, and yet she isn't. Just as none of us are completely, because our brains are wired to make snap judgements, especially under stress. I see a heck of a lot of people who are so absolutely anti-bigotry that they start thinking they're immune to it, and their actions end up being extremely bigoted. They become Bellweather.

d0qmm9p,"I want to address two points: 1) the idea that anyone can be anything as an incorrect message and 2) jokes about the nature of these creatures conflicting with the message.

Also,  I think another argument can be made that we are not fixed. We can change,  improve,  get better,  and that we can only learn our true limits by pushing up against them. For example it's clearly true, being a woman doesn't naturally preclude you from being a doctor nor does it automatically make you capable of being one,  but one cannot if you are either capable or incapable without trying. Also,  even someone best suited for the task must take some time to learn.  
  
2) Yes,  the story does poke fun based on--I guess animal stereotypes--but it also immediately flips on itself. I think the best example is Flash. The sloths being slow is clearly a joke based on stereotypes,  but then at the end we see Flash acting in the exact opposite manner. ",48vhc8

I think you need to lay off the tinfoil hats. ",48vhc8
d0vbbsd,I don't think they were trying to represent any singular group with the factions presented in the movie; it was more about the ideas of prejudice and stereotypes as opposed to literal representations of specific real world groups.,48vhc8
d0mwigs,Movie for kids.,48vhc8
d0qlxd4,"I disagree so i want to make a few points,  but before I start, I wanna say you're entitled to an opinion and that not liking something ain't a crime.   
  
I don't think that the press conference is a sudden negation of Judy's character development for several reasons. First,  let's recognize that Judy's character begins with a latent bias/prejudice against predators. This is established throughout the film based in some part on her interactions with Gideon and the influence of her parents (e.g. Fox repellant). We should also recognize that this prejudice is also complex and in some sense subconscious and unintended,  but  a bias nonetheless. The best example of this is when she buys a popsicle for Finnick and Nick. She thinks they're criminals, follows them in the store,  realizes she's being ""specieist?""  and tries to overcorrect and in doing so calls Nick a good father and a fox who is ""articulate"". The basic idea is that Nike isn't like other foxes who are sly, conniving, and inarticulate. He is one of the good ones. At this point in her development,  this is actually in some sense a half-virtue. She is not outright antagonistic towards predators, and is willing to make individual exceptions and to recognize that she is wrong about individuals, but not predators in general.   
  
Fast forward through the movie and we see a growing friendship between the two that suggests Judy clearly has no prejudice against Nick, the individual,  as a predator. However,  and this is important,  a lack of prejudice against an individual is not the same as a lack of prejudice towards a group. The fact that she has come to care about Nick as a close friend does not suddenly takeaway her general bias,  which is both an important and valid point to make.   
  
One could argue that Judy's conference is based simply on what was said by the scientist in Lionheart's secret detainment center,  but that doesn't excuse Judy. She doesn't question the argument that she's bringing to the table,  namely that predators are dangerous by their nature. Despite her time with Nick,  she brings the argument up during the conference and doesn't consider the consequences of accepting the argument at face value. When she's confronted with the mistake,  she tries to avoid blame by pointing out that the argument,  which she finds acceptable, doesn't apply to Nick as an individual. In the beginning, such an argument was a sort of half-virtue--better than a vice,  but not the same as doing the truly right thing. Here,  we see the limits of the idea that most predators are like A, but there are good ones that act like B. Nick is such an overwhelming exception to the rule,  that one is left with the ethical dilemma of accepting it or scrapping it entirely. The fact that Judy has grown to be friends with Nick and that this friendship doesn't negate her general prejudice is in keeping with the story's message overall.  
  
Nick's backstory seems flimsy to us,  but we are observers of someone else's pain so perhaps we have a tendency to underestimate it. It's one thing for a neighbor to be in pain. That's cause for sympathy. If we ourselves are in pain,  then it becomes a serious crisis. Nick's attitude and choices towards discrimination are the mirror image of Judy's. Is it the optimal way to cope with discrimination? No, but it is an emotional understandable reaction. If the game is rigged against you,  there's no point in playing your best. Also, I don't think the movie has a lenient attitude towards his life choices. Nick is potentially guilty of one crime--not paying taxes. I would argue that this was something done to move the plot. Judy needs some leverage over Nick and the suggestion in the film is that the act isn't an intentional attempt to defraud,  but rather a result of negligence. Everything else he did throughout the film was legal or within the bounds of technicality.  He has permits and a license for his business, for example. This isn't to say he was acting perfectly--far from it. But he also wasn't going beyond a level of rogueishness typical of a Disney character like Aladdin for example.  
  
The next part of your critique is strange to me. On one hand,  Disney plays it safe in the content of its commentary,  yet the way it's conveyed is unnecessarily contentious. I think the message is more complex than the simple notion that prejudice is bad. It goes beyond that. It's saying that prejudice can exist despite our best intentions and that it is only when we make an affirmative effort to recognize and remedy it within ourselves that we can finally reach a point of achieving virtue. It also saying that people are more than the attributes we assign to them. That's a meaningful message that not everyone fully appreciates. They understand it intellectually,  but not at a gut level.  
  
As for the means of conveying this message, I don't think it gets less controversial than this. Disney is using ""cute"" animals to convey a moral. This is literally a technique that's hundreds of years old stretching back to Aesop. Furthermore, I honestly don't think you can make a direct analogy between predators and prey with particular races in our own society. You could say predators are meant to be analogs for black people,  but then how do you explain discrimination against prey in the police force,  the use of the word cute, and the fact you're not supposed to touch a sheep's wool? These are clearly gesturing to issues that speak to a lot of black people as well. So prey and predator both share characteristics of both black and white people, yet both face discrimination. So it's not as if Disney is ""preaching"" from a point of bias.  
  
I think that you're entitled to consider it preachy and may be right, but considering the Aesop analogy and the fact that this is a Disney movie for kids, a moral is expected. One can disagree with the moral,  while still appreciating why it's included.  
  
Overall,  I think this is one of Disney's best films. It even manages to exceed many of Pixar's films with the exception of maybe Ratatouille. I think,  overtime,  it'll keep the reputation of being one of Disney's better films. ",48vhc8

If it's the latter than that would imply that a purely romantic relationship between different species would be ok as long as there is no sexual interaction, but then you have to ask where the line between friendship and romance is if both parties are acting asexually to each other.

The predators cleverly stand in for any race you could be prejudiced towards- they're a small minority that's unjustly feared, like black Americans, but they're also descended from deadly oppressors and are having a hard time shaking that image, like white Americans.

The whole point of using animals as people is that you can examine the ideas and issues of 'racism' without the baggage of our actual 'races', because when you make it about black humans and white humans, you're talking about a specific situation. When it's rabbits and foxes you can talk about racism itself without any additional context.",48vhc8

I think the movie had one or two issues in its message if you really think about it, but for kids the message should be pretty clear and positive. I just like that the story was interesting on its own and the character's actions made sense and had some depth. You can draw parallels between the movie and racism in our society, that makes the movie even better, but its not something as pointed as say animal farm.",48vhc8
d4fdfjg,"I think that this review is trying too hard to directly equate all the animals to their real life counterparts, while they didn't actually each have a specific counterpart.  
Every species in the movie was being oppressed, one way or another, this review immediately labels the predators as the minority and makes it all about ""minorities vs majorities"", which I think is a very big mistake.  
The movie didn't simply deal with any specific race or stereotype, it dealt with all of them. The predators were also oppressors in their own way, they were the minority but they used their size, strength and ""loudness"" to oppress the ""prey"".  
This is relevant to any number of issues, colonization by white oppressors, the rich oppressing the poor, etc.  

This reviewer needs to learn how to look beyond real life scenarios and deal with the bare basics of the issue, which is exactly what the animal metaphor is perfect for.  
The movie isn't about any one thing, it's about different classes, races, genders, etc. It's about every kind of stereotype or prejudice that you can think of, acting like it's as simple as ""minorities vs majorities"" is ridiculous.  

The one thing that the review is kind of right about is that generally there really is a difference between predators and prey, which makes the analogy a bit flawed if you think about it too much.  
But that problem is actually mostly solved in the movie because it turned out that the ""night howlers"" also affected prey animals, although it probably would've been better if we had actually seen a prey animal turn savage.  ",48vhc8

d17goq8,"I know what you're saying. The guilt wasn't caused by her discovery of the ""savage conspiracy,"" it was caused by her poorly worded-press conference. While that makes more sense, I still don't like that they used that as a device to move the plot. 

I felt like the writers were trying really hard to manufacture the guilt in Judy. When she was speaking with the media, all the reporters kept asking her leading questions to conclude that predators are instinctively savage. She didn't form that opinion herself; they were thoughts that the reporters (but really the writers) wanted her to think. This is how the writers tried to convince us that Judy was guilty for something that wasn't her fault at all. 

Also, the seed of mistrust would have spread through Zootopia whether or not she gave the press conference (someone, perhaps the assistant mayor, would have done it sooner than later). There's no way that she was the only one to notice the link between predators and all the savage animals. However, in the scope of the movie, literally no one suggests any other possible theories on what is happening. In a believable situation, people would have a discussion of inexplicable events and consider their possible causes. Instead, the writers designed everyone in Zootopia to blindly accept her conclusion so that they could pin more guilt onto Judy, which, once again, fabricates her guilt so she has a reason to go back to the farm and discover that actual cause of the problem.

Of course, this was only a small personal issue I had with an otherwise nice movie. Perhaps I'll get a better feel for the plot decisions on the next viewing.",48vhc8

Nothing Judy says during the press conference is inaccurate.

I think Nick is being very unreasonable to be offended because Judy was not politically correct enough, even though it was just established that Judy isn't comfortable doing a press conference, and it's almost hilarious that instead of blaming the actual events that lead to the attacks, Judy blames herself for saying the wrong thing. However in the context of the story arc I get that they needed some conflict between the two lead characters.

She notices him going into the elephant ice cream parlor, and although he looks suspicious she had no reason whatsoever to think anything of it...

It's part of her character development. She's all about being *big* because she's a ""prey"", but she fails to realize that the argument goes both ways.

The reveal of the gun being loaded with blueberries was definitely not a setup and doesn't feel contrived or anything. It just felt quick instead of having a strong reveal. I honestly thought Nick went savage and that she would think to use the Fox Spray, but then throw it away and appeal to his nature and he'd somehow snap out of it... or SOMETHING.

I haven't experienced that level of mistreatment since graduating and I in no way attribute my experiences with asians to the full population since i know many who are not like those people. Some people just pick on others and use whatever they want as their reasoning.

Life is great and although i do still see some racism every once in a while, it's way better than it used to be. I think we should acknowledge that racism and all of that is in us. We have evolved to be so. But i think we also need to be able to not let it influence our thinking and not act negatively towards others.

d0ol6fx,"The predators are depicted as being (no pun intended) at the top of the food chain in Zootopia. That doesn't exactly scream ""American black analog"" to me.

No particular species or group in Zootopia is meant to directly depict a real life group, and for that reason everyone is going to interpret it differently. For example, feminists could point to Judy Hopps as a sexism analog for ""breaking the glass ceiling"" and the way she was seen as being incapable of handling real police work because of her small stature, but there were already plenty of females of other species depicted on the police force. So was it more of a race thing? But there were already prey species on the force as well (heck, their boss was a wildebeest). Likewise, blacks could point to the predators being stereotyped as barely-contained monsters who could succumb to their savage instincts and attack the prey species at any time as being an analog for the way they're viewed by society, but so too could MRAs see it as a depiction of the way men as a whole are viewed by feminists. Or whites could see themselves depicted as the predators, with the prey species' inability to overlook their adversarial history being a representation of white people being stigmatized for historic injustices. The prey species are shown being looked down on and mistreated by the bullying predators, but at the same time the predators are a minority group in Zootopia and are shown being actively prejudiced against and stereotyped as savages by the prey species. So who's who? It's very hard to say.

That's the beauty of the way Zooptopia handled the issue. *Everyone* is shown being both prejudiced *and* prejudiced against because the reality is that *everyone* experiences racism and prejudice in one way or another, and for that reason *everyone* will be able to find something to relate to in the film and feel represents them. The message that diversity and equality is more complex than a simple slogan on a bumper sticker, that everyone has differences and limitations and we should recognize how that makes us alike, is a remarkably serious and mature take on the subject for a children's movie where the message is usually just ""everyone is the same and you should be blind to their differences.""",48vhc8
d0ol5ns,"Yeah, at the start of the film where he's told ""your kind aren't welcome"" it's definitely more racial, but the predator stuff is a dead ringer for extreme feminists who claim that all men are rapists in waiting ready to snap.

d0oenw6,"All the ""predators"" were of the male gender, it could be depicted as racial though, or perhaps both.

I think it's a great film for older kids who can begin to wrap their head around the issues - maybe 9+ - or maybe younger kids who unfortunately have been exposed to some of these topics already (drugs, police discrimination, etc) and have a frame of reference, but for the younger and more naive audience it leaves them confused.",48vhc8

 This was an official press conferance. Every word is under scrutiny (and she knew it,hence her anxiety) yet she was blabbering about things she had absolutely no idea about (she is no doctor, period) and voiced personal opinions . And it was total chaos as a result. Even if she *was* right, spreading panic is hardly what a decent police officer wants to do.

I think it's pretty typical for people who aren't comfortable speaking publicly to freeze up and say stuff they shouldn't--Judy didn't want to look uninformed so she filled the gaps in their actual knowledge of the case with her own assumptions, which turned out to be slightly bigoted. When Nick confronted her she was totally blindsided and got defensive and dug the hole even deeper. I thought it was a tremendously human (ha ha) moment--maybe they could have spent more time laying the groundwork, but I thought it gelled really well.

d0pbnmf,"Nope! Otters are predators. They eat other animals. (Contrast the Ottertons with Chief Bogo, who is physically imposing despite being a prey animal.)

Speaking of otters being predators (and, admittedly, rather unrelated to *Zootopia*), one of my favorite quotes, from Terry Pratchett's *Unseen Academicals* in the Discworld series:

>The Patrician [Lord Havelock Vetinari, Patrician of Ankh-Morpork] took a sip of his beer. “I have told this to few people, gentlemen, and I suspect I never will again, but one day when I was a young boy on holiday in Uberwald I was walking along the bank of a stream when I saw a mother otter with her cubs. A very endearing sight, I’m sure you will agree, and even as I watched, the mother otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon, which she subdued and dragged on to a half-submerged log. As she ate it, while of course it was still alive, the body split and I remember to this day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the delight of the baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy. One of nature’s wonders, gentlemen: mother and children dining upon mother and children. And that’s when I first learned about evil. It is built into the very nature of the universe. Every world spins in pain. If there is any kind of supreme being, I told myself, it is up to all of us to become his moral superior.”

I'm not sure what you mean by an outmoded form of racism that is a relic. I could make a guess at it, but I don't want to put words in your mouth. If it's racism based on biology, I would argue two things: 1) the movie focuses on biology because it makes the most sense in the context of a film where prey and predators have evolved. It would make less sense to try and claim that prey and predators are a certain way due to culture seeing as animals do not have cultures to pull from. 2) Biological racism still exists, it still comes up, it simply isn't brought out in public for everyone to see. If you're talking about a broader sense of racism, then, no offense, I'd really like to live on whatever planet you currently live on because racism, in a broad sense, definitely isn't a relic of the past.   
  
I don't think Disney is virtue signaling here. Virtue signaling would be suggesting that they're only bringing out this moral to win brownie points with others. But I don't honestly think they're saying they dislike prejudice simply because it makes Disney look good (although I'm sure as a corporation, they do take this calculus into account). There's more than likely a genuine dislike for prejudice and looking virtuous as an unintended side effect. Besides, why is trying to appear virtuous necessarily a bad thing? If you read, for example, Adam Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments, there's a great argument to be made that people strive to be virtuous so that they can be better liked by their fellow man. It's a way to reward and reinforce virtue, which seems like the right thing to do if you want people to be virtuous.  
  
I don't know what demographic you're speaking about, but I'm assuming you mean kids. Kids aren't going to push back against a film made my animals that has a moral to it. As I already mentioned, this tactic isn't a new or controversial one (see Aesop's fables as a prime example). It's a time honored technique for entertaining and teaching kids. So if the method is not controversial, then what is left is the content. If you don't think the moral is controversial, then there shouldn't be a problem here. I think the truth is though is that you do have a problem with the content in some way. I don't know what that issue is, but I don't see how having animals in a story with a moral is any more controversial than any other animated film that does it (e.g. Finding Nemo and the importance of not overparenting your kids).  
  
I gave a long discussion about why Judy didn't regress from childhood or change her character at the conference. I think there's an important distinction to be made between the belief we want to have and the ones we actually hold. I covered it in detail so I won't go back over it.  
  
The movie does get laughs from animal stereotypes at times. That's totally right. But just as it does that, it also goes back and totally flips them as well. The sloth scenes are the best examples. They get a lot of laughs from Flash at the DMV being slow because he's a sloth. But they also have the last gag, which is Flash driving like a madman (mad sloth?) in a speedster. I think that's a nuanced way to handle things. Some times we act like the way people think we will, but other times we don't. Because people are similar in some ways, unique in others. That's a perfectly fine stance to take.

So Frozen had a great deal of emotional depth to go along wth its strong plot points while Zootopia didn't have as deep a message and was not very good at plot points.

The problem is that after making that error, she quit her job instead of investigating further. The writers made Judy seem more guilty than in a realistic situation so that they could have her move back to the farm and progress the plot. Judy found this enormous conspiracy in Zootopia.

She was referring to Nick being different from a small percentage of animals who were going savage out of all the predators, and Nick connected it to the ""you people"" phrase that is openly recognized as racist.

It's that *enough* men are rapists and abusers that it's entirely reasonable for women to adjust their behavior to account for the possibility that any given male might be one.

Contrast that with what happened in *Zootopia*, where you only had a couple dozen cases of predators going feral, and even fewer victims (since most of the predators afflicted by the drug were quickly captured and ""disappeared""). This is in a city of several million inhabitants, so the odds of being victimized were incredibly small - and so taking action to protect yourself against that ""threat"" isn't a rational response, but one driven by fear and prejudice.

But if she and Nick were larger, even just a little bit so, they would have never gotten into that facility in the first place.

Also, throughout the movie Hoppes is berated for being ambitious, and told that she's essentially not big/fast/smart enough to try at being an officer, which could be a statement about encouraging young ladies to be more ambitious. Idk, I saw the rest of the movie commenting more on racial issues, but for Nick and Hoppes I sensed a different tone.

d0rpetj,"Why are we automatically assuming the predators are analogies for black people? The prey are also discriminated against in ways that are reminiscent of black people (e.g. Employment discrimination, only a bunny can call another bunny cute, can't touch a sheep's wool, etc.).  
  
If the film shouldn't be parallel with contemporary America, then what should it be parallel with? The 1960s? Race relations in Belgium? I don't think there's a reasonable alternative here that would work.    
  
As for biological racism, I pointed out that the movie focuses on biology because it makes the most sense in the context of a film where prey and predators have evolved.  
  
It doesn't particularly matter if the issue is biological racism or some other justification for an unjustifiable ideology. Racism is typically reviled as an unethical point of view. I say unethical because it has nothing to do with one's political views, but rather the character of the individual who holds them. An attempt to portray it as simply an unpopular political view is perhaps divisive, but perhaps it's best to draw a line against things that are clearly immoral. If there is a dividing line, it is only made worse by people who ignore the grievances and frustrations of other people.   
  
As for virtue signaling, I've already addressed it. Do you think that the people who made this film only spoke against prejudice to gain brownie points? I think it's possible to try to look good and to do the right thing. These are not mutually exclusive. Also, what exactly is wrong with the desire to appear virtuous? It's much better than the desire to appear un-virtuous. It's a strange critique against a person--""I dislike your message because you just want to look virtuous in front of others."" It has no bearing on the merit of the message itself and it assumes that wanting to appear good is a bad thing without looking further into it.  
  
Honestly, people who see a children's film arguing against contemporary racism and think its controversial are not the sort of people I understand nor agree with. Racism in America exists. That is a bad thing. Speaking out against it is an admirable thing to do. It's only divisive to someone who doesn't already feel alienated by racism in the first place.",48vhc8

I think that part can be written off as it just being a wild plant that most in zootopia aren't aware of, at least the side-effects of ingesting it. It's a big Earth and Zootopia was cited being the first place where the animals came together. It's possible that the entire world isn't civil or connected. So it makes sense that there's isolation with the world outside, even the outskirts. 

Also, even the backwoods rabbits/creatures didn't know much about the night-howlers. It just so happened that someone ate one and bit someone. And the particular family involved were suspicious of the plants after that; ""I don't like the kids going near those things after what happened before"". From what knowledge they did have, it was seen as a possible threat, not a definite one: They weren't dealing with the concentrated dose. 

Still, someone in the city *did* know about the plant. The otter botanist. He was trying to warn others about it (the taxi driver said he kept going on about it) but was shot with the concentrated dose. All the other targeted predators were large/scary threats.

d18qgo1,"I don't think what you are saying is not true. Indeed there was reason to believe the case was closed. But the way Judy reached this conclusion was problematic. Recall how the media interacted with Judy at her press conference. They swarmed her and asked her extremely leading questions that led her to the conclusion she reached. 

From that point until her quitting, there were literally zero references to any skepticism by her, reporters or anyone that there was another possible explanation. In this entire sequence where Judy cultivates the guilt that drives her to quit, we are only shown that literally everyone accepts the fact that predators are innately savage. 

Societies don't react to sudden inexplicable changes with a single conclusion; societies generally hold multiple major explanations and solutions for things like this. But we don't even see predators fighting what Judy suggested in her press conference (for instance, Cheetah just gives up his post with no resistance). We aren't shown any second opinions from any of the other detectives or scientists in Zootopia, who should have tons of things to investigate. Any reference that there was another explanation behind animals going savage is deliberately being blocked from the audience. It's because of this lack of skepticism that the transition between Judy's press conference to her quitting her job seems unnatural or forced. 

So who is blocking this skepticism? The writers. Why? Because if they didn't, then Judy would realize that there was more investigating to do and she shouldn't wallow in her guilt without knowing all the facts. What does that mean? Judy wouldn't go home. Why is that a problem? Because that is where the next major plot development occurs.

Anyway, to bring this back to your specific suggestion that she had every reason to believe that everything was over, yes, you're right. But it's because literally no one questioned anything. It's that unnatural lack of skepticism that makes the reason why Judy quit seem forced or manufactured. ",48vhc8

I get that it was a reference to it, but Nick was a single fox out of all the carnivores, only a small percentage of which were going savage. That's why I was confused when Nick got ticked off and said something along the lines of ""Oh, so it's 'them' now?"" when Judy said that he wasn't like ""them"" (the savages.)  Wasn't she specifically referencing a tiny violent group of the minority, and not the minority as a whole?",48vhc8

To quote the second article I linked:

>Schrodinger’s Rapist is not an argument of personal accusation, it’s an argument of statistics and precautionary measures. It’s an argument from trying to make the safest decision while not having all of the information that would be ideal to have. Not everyone has an STI, but a new partner could potentially have an STI, which is why people get tested. Not every wild animal has rabies, but the one that bit you is potentially a carrier of rabies, and it’s better safe than dead. Not every car trip ends in a crash, but every car trip could potentially end in a crash, which is why you wear a seatbelt. Not everyone gets the flu every season, but there is a chance that you could get it, so you get inoculated.

>If everyone could see a random stranger on the street and just know, “Oh, that one’s not a rapist”, then the whole analogy would break down. The same way Russian roulette wouldn’t make sense if you could look inside the gun before pulling the trigger. Obviously in the real world, though, we don’t magically know who’s who. A random stranger cannot magically tell that you, Dear Reader, are not dangerous, the same as they cannot tell which chamber has the bullet, which animals have rabies, which car trip will end in a crash, etc, etc. In short, the salient point is that just because you know you’re not a rapist doesn’t mean everyone else does.",48vhc8
d0oapqh,"As I stated in my original post - they didn't make a lot of successes with this film, in my opinion.

But let me explain a few of my points using one of your own examples: Wreck-It Ralph and why it's a far superior film.

In the first 10 minutes of Wreck-It Ralph we are introduced to the following things:

- The bad guys motto

- Ralph

- Felix

- The residents of the Niceville

- Q Bert and his friends and the fact that their game was pulled.

- The idea that going ""Turbo"" is a bad thing

- How Ralph wants to be the hero even though he is the villian

- The relationship Ralph has with Felix, the residents of Niceville, the residents of the arcade as a whole and the the relationship he has with himself and the world in which he resides.

All of these things, which are again introduced very early, come back into play later. Every single thing talked about in this film rolls around again.

Compare that to Zootopia in which in the first 10 minutes you are told about:

- Judy Hops and her desire to be more than society has etched out for her

- Judy's parents and their desire to keep her safe

- The Rabbit / Fox relationship.

- The predator / prey relationship of Zootopia and how Zootopia is this shining example of a perfect society.

- The police academy

All of these things come back up, which is fantastic except in that they only set the stage for what happens. Unlike Wreck-It Ralph, none of these things except Judy's desire to be better plays any real part in the main story to such a degree that it changes the world, unlike Wreck-It Ralph.

My main beef with this film is that there are elements thrown in the film that felt arbitrary. Judy's super hearing, her ability to fight bigger targets than herself, her ability to be fast, her ability to defy the norms of society.

Everything I described in my original post was getting at how these elements were thrown in and NEVER returned to. Characters were introduced for a single gag and never returned to the main story line. They weren't important to the main story even though they played a part in it all. They were used once and thrown away.

All I want out of a good film is the use of themes and characters that exist for a purpose. I don't want them to be there just to be there. Look at Hot Fuzz and how everything Nick Angel learned in the police academy came back up later in the film and served a purpose.

His morals, his judgement, his decisions all throughout the early portion of the film all return and play an important role in the entire film. They are pieces of his character that matter. Nothing was thrown in just to say he could do this or that because reasons. No. It had a purpose and those things exist for a reason, which makes his character all the much better.

d39k14h,I almost feel like this is a perfect stealth set up for Zootopia 2. They have so many more issues to delve into. Interspecies relations weren't shown AT ALL.

Maybe they dont even consider getting together but being such a prominent public female rabbit who is closest with a male fox... that might (excuse my punning) ruffle some real feathers in zootopia.,48vhc8
d18r803,"Yes, it was strange that no one bothered to question it, or rather that Judy didn't. There is no reason to believe some others weren't questioning if something more was going on but no one had a lead, the only reason Judy found out to ask Weasleton was she found out the roots he had when she caught him were nicknamed Nighthowlers. If anything it's strange she didn't know that since her uncle attacked her mother when he ate one, but anyway.

 In the end it's a movie and they have to have the plot move along 
in a dramatic fashion, and of course they needed the drama of Nick and Judy falling out, and the you gotta admit the bridge scene was sweet and funny. Are there plausible reasons for the events to play out like they did? Yes. Are those reasons admittedly a little weak and pretty obviously just to give the plot drama and feelings? Yes. Is the move still great and fun, and full of charm in spite of them? Definitely.

I completely understand your view, and I'm even willing to say the movie could have done a better job of making it believable, but it could have been a lot more contrived and I'm just glad the movie is as great as it is.

",48vhc8
d0oz4sy,"Well, yes. Judy was referring to only the tiny minority. But she still had the fox repellent. Not predator-repellent or even canine-repellent. Fox-repellent. It was specifically designed to hurt foxes. Furthermore, Judy showed no hesitation to chase after a weasel, which will readily kill a rabbit.

It's very curious. Twelve minutes into the film, Judy derides her old bully as a jerk. But she knows plenty of bunnies who are jerks. That the bully was a fox is neither here nor there. This is actually great commentary. 

But more damning I think is when Judy claims that a bunny cannot go savage. Naturally, we know this isn't true. Rabies is an equal opportunity offender among mammals, with rabbits being no exception. And many prey animals are actually extremely aggressive--hippopotami kill far more people every year than any other warm-blooded animals in Africa. 

Elephants are infamous for musth--male elephants periodically experience fits of extreme rage, with their testosterone levels increasing sixty-fold. That's *6,000 %*",48vhc8

d0rlgex,[deleted],48vhc8
d0obk5q,"I have not seen Hot Fuzz so I cannot comment on any of that. But there are definitely elements of the film that return. For example, the predator/prey relationship and how Zootopia is the perfect society. We actually learn pretty early in the film that Zootopia is NOT at all a paradise where predators and prey coexist in harmony. Also, Judy's training at the police academy did come up a few tumes, such as when she blackmailed and tricked Nick. Also, Mr. Big's daughter is a character that returned and had relevance in the plot. Also the rabbit/fox relationship returns after Judy's speech when Nick attempts to frieghten her to see if she is afraid of him. Also, I have no issues with some characters not returning or having more televance to the plot than a single gag. 

I guess all that is left to say is that if you didn't enjoy the movie, then that's all there is to it. I don't want to force you to believe that it is the best movie in the world, because their simply is no such thing, as best is subjective. However, I found the movie extremely enjoyable, in fact I am considering returning to the theater at some pointbto watch it again. And yes, it is true, foxes are my favorite anomal and I love animals, which also gives Zootopia extra points for me. Wreck-It Ralph is most definitely a great movie as well ( I also love video games), but I found Zootopia to hit me harder than Wreck-It Ralph in terms of laughs, tears, and joy. Though I gotta admit I never saw that King Candy as Turbo plot twist coming.

d0s3xpr,"It's not the fact that he dislikes the film. That's fine. He could say the plot was too predictable or that Judy's  character development was poor,  and I would say he has a right to that opinion. The problem I have is the idea that making a movie about race relations in contemporsry America is controversial.  
  
First, as I said earlier, it's hard to draw a similarity between groups in the movie and races in real life since both prey and predator suffer from forms of problems and discrimination that often occur to black people. It would be easier and a stronger argument if one group were clearly white and the other black,  but that's not the case.  
  
Second,  assuming that it can be viewed as a modern race relations film where one group is clearly white and the other black,  then I would say it isn't controversial or divisive.  
  
This person finds a children's movie to be divisive and controversial. So of course I want to understand why. He says that the message (prejudice is bad) is non-controversial,  but says drawing a parallel with contemporary America is controversial. I don't see how contemporaneous makes it more controversial. I could see it being more controversial if Zootopia were a 1960s version of America with violence,  overt racism,  and segregation. In fact,  racism only becomes less controversial as you go forward on the American timeline. So it almost feels like this movie is condemned to be controversial because they couldn't set it in a less controversial period. That or it isn't the time that's controversial,  but the message. I think that's what really bothers people. And if that's the case,  then the argument against the movie is ideological and not on its artistic merits, which is biased and unfair. ",48vhc8

But to many, many clueless morons in this shitty society, it's just a film about animals wearing clothes. It's film to take the kids to see because the kids want to see it, and anyone who isn't a kid who wants to see it, is looked upon as a man-child. There's still a horrible stigma about adults going to watch animated movies - no matter how many of them get released that become classics over the years, all animated movies will be still be labelled soft kiddie movies and not ""everyone can see it"" movies. If they were marketed better, this disgusting stigma wouldn't exist. The adverts are just going to show the goofy slapstick moments and the cutesy parts, the BBFC will slap it with a big U rating and they'll be plenty of stuffed animals in the stores, and thus all the idiots who haven't done ANY research into it will just think it's just another silly animal CGI movie and nothing else.

Sure she's seeing it in the world around her but it would all be coming home because to her its not a general ""conspiracy"" its a specific I lost a friend over this. On top of which she wanted to make the world a better place and not only does she feel she broke it (right or wrong) but more importantly she has no idea what to do to make it better. So very specific guilt and a feeling of helplessness all combined on someone who probably is feeling a sense of lonliness (she does has over 200 brothers and sisters) so she runs to a source of comfort her parents.

With regards to the press conference specifically Judy is fairly naive and innocent still in a lot of way's hence Nick's coaching which was why she thought she'd done well there till she came down and Nick confronted her. Compare her face and comments with Bellweathers.

As for Bellweather standing put she was very confident in her ability to spin the situation ""Yes Chief Bogo I was here conducting an inspection of the museum to remind myself of where we come from and I saw the fox attacking Officer Hopp's, I asked my security officers to help her but they were too late and unfortunately the fox was killed in their attempt.""

>And that is? You never actually stated what you believe is reasonable.

Telling a friend to call the cops if you don't check in with them after a date, not going out alone after dark except in well-lit populated areas, avoiding or limiting interaction with male strangers, etc. Moreover, doing these things when interacting with men but not when interacting with other women.

>The point being if we define rape as something almost exclusive to the ability of men, then of course it's going to be a skewed statistic, and you are using this skew to support your sexism.

Let's imagine for a moment that, in addition to 1 in 5 women being forcibly penetrated (or the victims of attempted forcible penetration), roughly 1 in 5 men would be forced into penetrating a woman, against the man's will, at some point during their life. This wouldn't tell us anything about whether women should be extra cautious around men - it would mean that men should be extra cautious around women. (The actual figure, per the CDC, is 1 in 21 men forced into involuntary penetration.)

To put it simply - if you're a woman, you are *far* more likely to be sexually victimized by a man than by a woman, so it makes sense to be more defensive against men than against women. By contrast, if you are a white person, you are not significantly more likely to be victimized by a black person that by a white person, so it does not make sense to be more defensive against black people than against white people. (Most crime against whites is committed by other whites, just like most crime against blacks is committed by other blacks.) That's why the racism analogy doesn't work.",48vhc8
