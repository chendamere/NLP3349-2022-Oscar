James Franco right before he dies: ""*Now that's a pretty girl*"".

The whole romantic buildup in *The Gal who got Rattled*. I thought when that Comanche hit Arthur, I thought the gal was gonna kill the Indian. Then Arthur pulls a quick one, and it wasn't until the dog barking and whimpering I realized. Had to take a fucking break because that fucked me up the most.

e9wjip3,"Rating: 8/10. Throughly enjoyed the movie.  Since it is told through different chapters, i'll just say somethign about each one of them.

The Ballad of Buster Scruggs: Tim Blake Nelson as Buster Scruggs was fantastic. Loved every second of it.

Near Algodones: Short and funny. I wonder if Stephen Root got the job due to him playing Milton in Office Space. I immediately thought they were similar.

Meal Ticket: Damn! I'm still thinking about that chapter. Where did they first team up? Were they good friends once or was Impresario always just after the money from the start? Harry Melling's performance was amazing, especially when he realized what was about to happen.

All Gold Canyon: Stunning scenery and great performance by Tom Waits. Damn you Coen brothers for tricking us.

The Gal Who Got Rattled: Oh fuck off! seriously?! It was shaping up to be such a tragically beautiful story that ultimately had a happy ending and then this?!

The Mortal Remains: Well, that turned bleak quickly. Quite literally. Still a bit stunned by that chapter.",9x1g48

The whole time I was terrified the dog was going to die, but when the ending happened, when you see Alice had shot herself, my wife said 'Oh I wish the dog would have died instead'.  Thats when it struck me how the Coens toyed with us by using emotions about dog...the relief when you realize Billy hadn't killed it, and the realization that if he had managed to shoot the dog then Alice wouldn't have chased after it and gotten killed in the end.

Eventually, another musically inclined gunslinger came along and proved his worth by killing him. No issues, nothin' personal. All part of the life. They sing in harmony. The victorious black-wearing gunslinger listens to Buster Scruggs ghost sing, nods appreciatively, and then continues his verse. It's one of the happiest stories, honestly. It depicts a pretty happy world, where people have their all lives figured out.

But my favorite was the one with the gold prospector.",9x1g48
ea6lzkj,"There's a lot of different ways to analyze the segments in this anthology film, and when I think about the various styles on the same theme, I'm reminded of several literary styles that all focus on the struggle against death.

The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is an obvious homage to 50's and 60's western movie tropes, but it has a definite Greek tragedy theme.  Scruggs is the indomitable ""hero"" with a fatal flaw that eventually brings about his death.  His confidence in himself was truly warranted, but it grew to the point that it caused a misstep that cost him his life.

Near Algodones doesn't fit as neatly into a literary category, but there's an obvious connection to Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge, so I'd throw it in the American classics genre.

Meal Ticket could have been written by Poe.  The American gothic style is very fitting.

All Gold Canyon is a naturalism story through and through, man surviving nature and sometimes the cruelty of his fellow man.

The Gal Who Got Rattled is a Shakesperean tragedy in many ways.  The romance mixed with harsh realities and the tragic twist fits this genre perfectly.

The Mortal Remains is an allegory play, reminiscent of Dante's Divine Comedy.  It even has the lyrical style, with much of the communication happening in song or in long monologues with a poetic rhythm. ",9x1g48
e9x0u4t,"Meal ticket was genius. The contrast between an actor performing the world’s greatest works and the one trick chicken really shone a light on just how brutal his world view is. The sum value of the performer was the money he brought in. His talent, friendship, experience accounted for nothing. Killing him was an economic decision (the frequent dinner scenes combined with the chicken feed really hit this home for me.)

This dark tale explores the emptiness of the economic choices life can force us to make, often at the expense to our culture and humanity.

ebquj4g,"Lots of comments I agree with, I'll just mention my favorite ""easter egg"" connection between the stories. (pun intended)  Only caught this on the second viewing.

In All Gold Canyon, the Prospector climbs a tree to harvest bird eggs, but then sees the owl giving him the death stare from another tree.  He reluctantly puts all the eggs back, then thinks about it and takes one saying, ""How high can a bird count, anyways?""

Hot damn, though, those other four stories were fantastic. Meal Ticket was macabre and oppressively bleak, fine qualities. All Gold Canyon is gorgeous and features maybe Tom Waits' best performance. The Gal Who Got Rattled felt like a feature length film in 1/4 of the time.

ea6w2zp,"Meal Ticket, I think, is asking us to contrast the Artist with Ozymandias, perhaps the most quoted piece in the Artist's rota.

The Artist's performances start strong: the Artist draws in a big crowd; but they grow progressively smaller until the Artist, like Buster Scruggs, is eclipsed by a new act: a counting chicken. All his culture and oratory offers the Artist little respite from his fate: to be discarded, so that the Impresario can get his next meal ticket; like Ozymandias's monuments being swallowed by the unrelenting desert. Human hunger, humanity's need to feed, is as merciless as that desert.

Rankings:

1. The Mortal Remains.
A Serious Man is my favorite Coen brothers movie and this short reminded me so much of the opening for that movie. Such a simple story but told so well.

2. All Gold Canyon.
This would be my number 3, but I love Tom Waits too much and the performance was amazing. Man's relationship with nature is a theme I always love to meditate on with film.

3. The Gal Who Got Rattled.
An absolute rollercoaster. I was so touched by the romance but was still filled with dread the entire time because I knew there had to be death coming. It's still the most optimistic of the bunch and almost a breath of fresh air from all the despair.

4. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.
So over the top and reminiscent of the classic westerns. It was a great intro and set the tone for all the other stories: letting the viewer know that this isn't the comedy it would appear to be.

5. Near Algodones.
The funniest short to me. I can't believe how absurd it got. All the shorts were filmed wonderfully, but the imagery of this one will stick out the most in my memory.

6. Meal Ticket.
The most gruesome of all of them, and it dragged in the middle for me. Still a necessary chapter for exploring the value of human life.

When I saw the 'pretty girl' before Cowboy was hanged, I thought that for him his death at that moment was a better way to go than by the tree in the desert. I also thought for some reason that Coen Brothers may expand on this thread, making Cowboy imagine what it would be like if he was with the 'pretty girl' and they had a normal life together - sort of like what Mr. Knapp had in store for his life with Miss Longabaugh -, before he is hanged.

In “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,” Buster plays cards in the game against Surly Joe and a Frenchman. Firstly, he foreshadows this event in his first address to the audience very directly, adding to his fourth-wall-breaking character.

This card game with the Frenchman involves the Frenchman declaring Buster must play the cards he was dealt, exactly as the Frenchman in “The Mortal Remains” used to describe life. Very interesting stuff, and I love how each individual vignette is connected to multiple others in various ways.

The song ""The Unfortunate Rake"" that is sung by Clarence in The Mortal Remains, was re-imagined to become one of the most iconic country/western ballads of the 20th century ""The Streets of Laredo."" Thematically very similar to original, it has been sung by may country music legends: Marty Robbins, Johnny Cash, Roy Rodgers, Arlo Guthrie (not a legend but a fun version and who doesn't love Arlo) and a million others. 

I never knew the original song until it was sung in this movie, and it was a really nice moment of synergy that the Coen brothers are great at highlighting. Go listen to ""The Streets of Laredo.""",9x1g48

eamdzi2,"To me each story had a deeper meaning,

The first story about Buster was this guy who is basically just perfect, he does what he wants yet respects others boundaries unless his are disrespected, great skill with guns and music, can win a crowd in song,  just overall good/cool guy. Then he gets killed by a dude in pure black while hes in white, kinda seemed like death taking him like the good die young type thing. Granted he was not very young, but he was not a old man, so it says that your reputation will eventually take you down. Even if you are a good person

&#x200B;

The second about the bank robber to me was about karma, you fuck somebody, and even if you escape the consequences they will still come back to haunt you.

&#x200B;

The third one about the guy without arms and legs spoke to me about business, specifically (music/movies) you can be unique and as long as you draw a crowd the men making money off you will bend over backwards (literally feeding you) to make the show go on, but once you dont bring in the crowds they will back stab and fuck you over for something not even half your worth. Because its all about the money for them.

&#x200B;

The fourth kind of seemed like humans fighting over the worlds natural beauty. When the miner came to the valley all the animals dissipated, then after he left they all came back. He was only there to take the gold (bounty of mother nature) and once the miner kills the other guy who followed him and gets his gold he leaves (metaphor for humanity killing itself off and disappearing). This especially stuck to me because the coen brothers put the animals in the movie leaving in the start and coming back at the end, and they pick this beautiful valley, so this just spoke to me.

&#x200B;

The fifth to me was about lack of knowledge and how good intentions without the proper experience behind it can still be disastrous. Does not matter if you have a good view of life if you arent knowledgeable about whats out there the world will still eat you up. At the beginning they are arguing about coughing and basically establishes their lack of knowledge during this time. Then they leave on the trail and her brother dies the next day (presumably from the cough but who knows). Then shes all alone and because she didnt know anything about what he was doing shes in the dark and completely fucked. She leaves the money on her brothers corpse, I mean she doesnt even know if 400$ is a lot back then. She gets help from the two guys running the trail, and his best idea is to literally marry a girl he barely knows (which is not uncommon back then, but still he hasnt weighted out any other options). The dog represents inexperience, he brother owns it, then the guy she almost marries tries to kill it but doesnt succeed showing hes inexperienced, and then she basically dies cus she chases off trail which was really stupid thing to do and it basically insured her death. Then at the end she shoots herself cus she does what shes told when she thinks the guy is dead, in fact at this point i thought she would shoot the indian in the back but no she shot herself lol that one surprised me. Anyways the only guy who had all the wisdom and knew so much about indians enough to defend himself against like 20 of them ends up being in a position hes never been in where he has to explain what happened. Even after a long life, i mean its reiterated that this man is extremely old by his partner a few times, this kinda reinforces that life never stops showing you it can fuck with you.

The last story to me represented death, the two bounty hunters represent the devil and the grim reaper. The guy who distracts is the devil and like the devil he wastes your time on earth with petty shit, stories you already know but you are still intrigued, represents sins, you commit them 1000 times but it never satisfies. The guy who thumps is death. The wagon driver is just the passage of death, does not stop for anyone its company policy(the ways of the great beyond or some shit). The three people all have different views of life, trapper thinks were all animals who do whatever, the lady thinks were either good or evil, and the french man sees us as all having different journeys and interpretations based on our experiences. The hotel is the afterlife I think maybe heaven, and that man that the bounty hunters took is going to hell possibly but who knows. In the end all these completely different people go to the same place regardless of ideals or backgrounds. We all go to the same place at after we die.

I might be looking too deep but this is what stuck out to me.

eairzzc,"The Englishman, Thigpen, I believe is in the saloon in the first story and delighted by Buster’s song. Another redditer mentions that there is also symmetry with regards to Buster’s hand and some of the Frenchmen’s speech at the end (see below). Was Thigpen only used as a framing device or is he lurking in any of the other stories? Are their more parallels to the first and last stories?

If the last story is about being ferried to the afterlife, how does that square with Buster’s wings into the sky?

I suppose you could reach and suggest Buster is more of an Old Testament version of rightousnous and the other folks are more a Catholic/purgatory approach.

It's fairly uneven, and the whole is a weird combination of the sum of it's parts but they really displayed the scope of their directorial abilities and over all craft. They go back to a kind of cartoonish style that is reminiscent of Hudsucker or Raising Arizona for a lot of it and it's pretty fun though the middle two stories can drag a bit (but that felt like it was on purpose). 

I think the big issue with it is that until the fourth vignette you don't get a main character to identify with for any reasonable period of time and the fact that it's structured as a movie makes the incongruent tone of the shorts very tough to get in tune with. Maybe they were trying to do something with that but I can't really say. Over all I think I'd have enjoyed it more as a series of shorts where I have time to chew on each story in their own right, rather than immediately rolling into the next one. ",9x1g48
ea16478,"Well what an unexpected delight this was. I hadn't really heard anything about the film at all and it seems to have had no hype at all in the UK at least (maybe because it's just a Netflix release), but obviously when I saw that it was a Coen Brothers film I was immediately interested. It did not disappoint - in fact I think it may be up there in my top 3 Coen Brothers films ever. At times hilarious, deliciously dark, brutal, utterly gorgeous, thought-provoking, filled with wonderful Coenesque dialogue, and always thoroughly entertaining. 

I've seen a few reviews complaining about the inconsistent quality of the stories and that it is dull at times. I don't buy either of these arguments. Of course you are never going to get 6 stories all at the same quality, but I found every story to be interesting in it's own way and even the ""slower"" tales held my attention thanks to the performances, sheer beauty of the cinematography, and knowledge that some kind of wicked twist is never far away.  For example, ""Meal Ticket"" is certainly on the slower side but wow that ending was dark! I think the fact that I've seen so many different rankings of the stories speaks volumes for how each will appeal to different people in different ways, and that each has it's own charm and quality.

Did I mention that it's absolutely gorgeous to look at?! Like seriously, this needs to be winning cinematography awards. It's a real shame it was straight to Netflix as this demands to viewed on the biggest screen possible. (Also did anyone else get serious Red Dead Redemption 2 vibes with a lot of the landscapes??

From this movie, it seems to me that the Coen brothers are just telling stories. Obviously, there are connections and extensive attention to detail, but it seems like a series of nearly pointless stories like from the ancient Greeks (I think it's the Greeks). It makes even more sense to me when you view the Coen brothers as masters of their craft in a similar vein to how we've seen Jim Carrey the past several years. At some point you arrive at a pinnacle of pointlessness. What is truth, meaning, right, wrong? Life happens and it doesn't follow a set path. Halfway into Near Algodones, I took this perspective and thoroughly enjoyed it. I viewed these stories in the same way a sparrow may fly through a forest and interact with many things:  Animals may hear its song, a seed from a plant may be ingested and freighted to another forest to then grow, a hawk may catch and eat it; while there are connections, they are very different and unique stories.

Really liked all the individual stories actually, although the first two were a bit short compared to how good they were, and I thought the third one stayed a bit too long, despite overall liking the story of it. Loved the magical “realism” of it all and the soundtrack is wonderful as well. I especially love how the first two play out, with them having this sense of grander power helping them out or almost making them feel invisible but then nope, they pull the rugs from under you. How they felt lucky or invisible because they survived that far, but then suddenly gone. 

The movie is quite tragic and funny at the same time, which I guess that is a common trait in the Coen’s movies. This is only my third(heresy I know…) after Fargo and No Country, but based on those 3 so far I really need to watch more Coen’s that I have put off for a long time for no reason.

Maybe it’s because it’s the only one that ended well, but All Gold Canyon might just be my favorite, and 	Tom Wait’s performance is great in that one. I was expecting him to get a heart attack and die tragically like all the others, but it’s nice to get one success story from this movie!

All Gold Canyon **>=** The Ballads of Buster Scruggs **>** Near Algodones **>=** The Gal Who Got Rattled **>** The Mortal Remains **>** Meal Ticket.

Like he murders that guy and starts singing that song and everyone just plays it straight like he is nuts (kind of how the song begins) and he just does his whole song and dance basically holding a terrified room hostage the whole time.  Like he really puts on a show and hams it up acting it all out with people just horrified and afraid they will be next.  It would be a completely different movie but I think its a neat idea.

I feel like the Coens and Tom Waits captured extreme frustration and tragedy and loss and most importantly, a deep sorrow at the wickedness of men. All in, what, 20 minutes or so?

Next paragraph is heavy with spoilers

[The audience sees the prospector working, and striving for his goal, we see him being an honest hard working guy who knows what he's doing, and we share in the journey as he excitedly finds his gold. But what if the would-be thief had just killed him? Yes, it would have been sad and tragic, but we've all seen similar things in movies before. To portray him as surviving and winning, but be being grievously injured, was brilliant IMO. Now we see him technically victorious, but his heart is broken by the cruelty of the world, and with his raw frustration and sadness combined with his physical pain and uncertainty that he could even make it back to town... Just amazing work from Tom Waits, and brilliant writing from the Coens.](#spoiler)

**The Ballad of Buster Scruggs** 

The best of the bunch, weird and zany and just plain fun.

&#x200B;

**Near Algodones** 

I think EVERYBODY missed the point on this one.  This story is nothing more than a long, drawn out setup for the punch-line at the end (First Time?).

&#x200B;

**Meal Ticket** 

My least favorite, a compelling story that got a bit too drawn out.  I believe this to be mostly a commentary on the harsh brutality of life in the west at that time.

&#x200B;

**All Gold Canyon** 

**The Gal Who Got Rattled** 

Loved both of these stories because they were both about the journey, and not the destination.  Each of these could have ended any number of ways, and they would have been just as enjoyable.  I REALLY wish there were more movies with this level of storytelling.

&#x200B;

 **The Mortal Remains** 

I felt this one to be the most ""Coen-brother-y"" of the bunch.  I see a lot of debate between those who thought the passengers were already dead, and those who thought they weren't.  My interpretation is that there really is no right answer here.  It's intentionally left up to the viewer to decide what to make of this.  Kind of like the ending to No Country,

Nothing wrong with digital of course (look at their bud Roger Deakins) and I saw that Delbonnel shot it too so it's not like they're incompetent.

During the carriage ride, they also explain each of their three opinions on what people are really like, and how they behave. The two men are agents of Death, but they don't really have an opinion about people per se. The man in the checkered suit sings a song about death, laying out an ideal way to go: surrounded by lovely people and covered with roses to hide the last of his humanness. The other man with the goatee just purely enjoys watching people at the end of their lives as they realize what is happening. This to me is the truly horrifying part of the chapter, which is why I love that it's last. No matter how we spin it, death is death, and the only lucky ones are the ones who avoid dying long enough to observe other people dying before them.

e9xqrts,"Forgive my jumbled thoughts, I don't have a lot time to format and edit right now.

This is how I saw the meaning in each of the stories. They seem Biblical in message and/or more so Black Forest Fairy Tales. Some of these are more open to interpretation than others. 

1. **The Ballad of Buster Scruggs**
Story of ""pride comes before the fall"" - also the idea being so full of ones self to think that the world revolves around you even up until and after death.

2. **Near Algodones**
You reap what you sow. Franco's character put his faith is tangible things - money - that he lost sight of the beauty life has to offer: a beautiful girl with whom he could have had a fulfilling relationship with.

3. **Meal Ticket**
The moral and ethical choice to make over when to care or not care for those who can no longer help themselves and the burden they cause. 

4. **All Gold Canyon**
Not entirely sure yet. I think it has something to do with how 'sin' follows the innocent ambition of man or be good stewards of what exists. A man has a good relationship with nature and his environment and is careful to not take more than he needs, but in his attempt to gain wealth there is always someone who is willing to take shortcuts regardless the cost to what is around them - forever tarnishing the land/relationship.

5. **The Gal Who Got Rattled**
""Sins of the Father"" - The brother in this case controlling all needs of his sister and not letting her grow from needing his provision to wanting his company being able to provide for herself. Then when realizing she can make decisions for herself - accepting marriage during easy times - to failing to make her own way and resorting to what was instructed of her - killing herself. This is a story of self destructive tendencies and the problem of co-dependencies.

6. **The Mortal Remains**
There is no one moral high ground/The Golden Rule - A very loose tale of showing people can set forth for themselves their own definition of life, people, etc. without being able to recognize the value of someone else's contribution to understanding. The 3 characters are not treating each other with the respect they think they themselves deserve in sharing their ideologies. All the while not realizing they themselves are being judged/have been judged by the other 2 characters God/Devil or Good/Evil etc. and being caught up in nuance.

I liked the film overall. I thought it was different than what the trailer advertised, but I still enjoyed it. My personal rating for the stories are as follows: The Mortal Remains, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, The Gal Who Got Rattled, Near Algodones, All Gold Canyon, Meal Ticket.

The beauty I think of this film is that each story will impact someone else differently. Each story can teach a lesson, but the strength of each lesson taught will be different depending on how each viewer can relate to the stories.

The last story (The Mortal Remains) does a great job I think summarizing the whole film, mainly, everyone will have a different view, understanding, or message to learn/gain, but we all end up at the same place. Death.",9x1g48

e9t4put,"Some stories were better than others but in general I loved it. My personal favourite was the Gold Prospector one, but I am a massive Tom Waits fan, so seeing him in a Coens film was incredible. I pissed myself laughing when he was screaming ""you didn't hit anything important""",9x1g48
ecbx7zy,"I love the Coens and this was getting a lot of praise so I went in with high expectations. But I found it to be a real disappointment. The opening title vignette is fantastic and really sets the bar high. Near Algodones was too short and didn't really have a compelling character. It felt like only 10-12 minutes. I enjoyed Meal Ticket. Even in a mostly wordless role, Liam Neeson really stood out. All Gold Canyon was hit and miss for me. Tom Waits was compelling as the gold digger but the scene where [the man shoots him and tries to steal his gold] (#spoiler) felt so heavy handed. Tom Waits basically ends up screaming exposition after that and it just felt forced. The Gal Who Got Rattled is the longest but also seems to be the most developed of all the stories. I thought the flow was a little jagged but there's a handful of good scenes in it. I found The Mortal Remains to be flat out boring outside of a couple of scenes: [the first one being Brendan Gleeson's song] (#spoiler) which comes as a breath of fresh air and adds some much needed emotion. The second one comes as [the two bounty hunters get the body off the top of the stagecoach] (#spoiler). It's a moment of dark humor that really landed.

Overall I wasn't really impressed with it. The cinematography is gorgeous and it's very well-directed. It's not like the Coens don't know what they're doing. But a lot of the stories either just feel thin and/or aren't very interesting. This was supposed to be a one-off miniseries on Netflix. They clearly ended up just cutting them all together for a feature length film. I think if a couple more of the stories were fleshed out, it could've been something really special. But it's a very hit-or-miss affair. More miss than hit unfortunately.",9x1g48

And the stories themselves are not even that long within the movie, but you find yourself unapologetically attached to each character. But all you can wonder about them is what their inevitable demise will be. Not only do you not expect the endings, they also end way darker than you would imagine.

The movie also makes you think a lot about what it took for humanity to get to where it is today; surrounded by technology, in constant contact with one another, never have to be left alone with our thoughts. But hundreds of years ago when people were settling the U.S., creating the cities we live in today, men were killing each other over Mr. Pockets and their ego, and killing themselves the second they found themselves alone and surrounded by ""savages.""Men who were true, not to mention limbless, artists putting on Shakespearean experiences each night, only to find themselves competing with a chicken.

I mean, you wish they gave their characters a happy ending, and yet their stories are always so well constructed and meaningful that in the end you can't simply be depressed, a little part of your brain *has* to recognise their brilliance. 

I'm talking about The Girl Who Got Rattled. 

As the story went on, Knapp and Alice slowly warmed up to one another, realizing they might indeed find comfort in each other, and it was delightful but I just wanted the segment to be over because the writing was all over the fucking wall and in the end it was worse than I thought. 

No one was at fault, or perhaps everyone was a little at fault.

But even devastated as I was, I had to admire the way they built the characters and their relationships to each other. 

For instance, Alice and Knapp, in their conversations, always ended up talking about her brother and Mr Arthur, which was, imo, a way to show how similar these two people were: lonely, both havng somebody that occupied a large space in their life, one a smothering figure (the brother), one mysterious for us but, it turns out, admirable. The more they talked, however, the more they moved to more personal subjects,  secrets, life views, and discovered they might really be a good fit for each other. 

I love the way Mr Arthur is shrouded in mystery up until the end; you don't get why Knapp talks so highly of him and even you wonder whether to expect a dirty trick from him or what. Instead, he absolutely comes through for his friend in the end, with deeds, not words, though he's gonna have to find words, too, to explain that senseless tragedy.

I didn’t know they used to be led across the West like that but it makes sense. I’ve always thought about how terrifying it must have been for those who moved out West. Up until even the 1930s you’re dealing with outlaws, corrupt law enforcement, and then prior to that you’re dealing with Native American attacks on top of the brutal climate of the Midwest. Crazy to think how much time it took to walk alongside or ride in your wagon all the way to Oregon or even just Wyoming. I’ve always wondered what cultural aspect setting down roots in an extreme place had on midwesterners vs those from the east coast. Being from the southeast I personally find midwesterners to be genuinely kind and easy going, less materialistic, etc. I did find myself wondering if what happened to Alice was on purpose because of how Knapp said Arthur knew the plains like the back of his hand. Made me wonder if he led her into that and gave the Chief a war sign because he didn’t want Knapp to retire and leave him. 

Meal Ticket made me feel some kind of way. That episode was just... sad. I thought the young fellow was really quite handsome and was hoping he would meet and fall in love with someone who would take him in. The emotion expressed by that actor was phenomenal and I felt myself feeling it through his eyes. It’s crazy to think how little support was around back then for things like that. Today those people could probably live without much outside help but back then it was like feast and famine. And gosh the end just broke my heart. The absolute helplessness of it had me wriggling in my seat. 

Algodones was funny. I especially laughed at the “First time?” Question. James Franco doesn’t particularly draw my eye but he was pretty handsome in this. Love that he found a small comfort at the end in such a minor but meaningful manor. 

I loved the symbolism in the gold episode. It was like man comes in and takes what he wants but then goes back out and nature takes back over. Makes me think of a similar thing if modern man ever fell. Nature disappears and we hardly see it but if we ever went away it would come back out and flourish. 

Also loved buster Scruggs and how over the top it was. It made me laugh and I liked the music and end. 

Anyone have ideas about the states each was set? I’m thinking Buster Scruggs was Utah going down into Arizona or NM.

I'm a long-time fan of the Coen brothers and it was great to see them return to form after the so-so Hail, Caesar!

tBoBS is imperfect, but there is so much to savour and unpack that it would be petty to linger too long over the shortcomings.

&#x200B;

In some ways Hail, Caesar! and Buster Scruggs are actually not dissimilar in their approach; the former is a disparate group of stories and characters tenuously linked through Capitol studios and Josh Brolin's fixer character, the latter also offers a series of loosely-related vignettes; these however are framed in such a way as to highlight rather than obscure the film's disjointedness.

The whole thing is shot with the kind of assured clarity and attention to detail that marks the Coens as standard-bearers of their craft; some of the vistas displayed here are nothing short of breathtaking. The grain of a page's pulped paper or the tactile leather on the titular character's chaps are given every consideration.

&#x200B;

**The Ballad of Buster Scruggs**

A cartoonishly playful homage to the Gene Autry singing cowboy type (again, a character trope touched upon in Hail, Caesar!), the opening chapter of the film sees Tim Blake Nelson's incongruously psychotic character conspiratorially entertaining the audience with both song and comical violence.

The ludicrous angel at the end of this chapter recalls Charles Durning's Waring Hudsucker 25 years earlier.

The brothers mind to show Scruggs playing his geetar from *inside* the body of the instrument itself was hilarious for both its readability and the uncanny well-thats-exactly-what-it-*would*\-sound-like audio design - a brilliantly executed throwaway gag. Scruggs' bloody jaunt provides plenty of black laughs and in some ways pokes fun at the Coens themselves, who have often been accused of harbouring a misanthropic streak in their work.

**Near Algodones**

This brief episode is nevertheless expertly paced, as James Franco's witless would-be bank robber is eventually hanged for a crime he didn't commit, after escaping punishment for one that he did.

Despite a generally comic tone, this vignette could serve as a dry run for an adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's *Blood Meridian,* a masterpiece of a novel that Franco himself once threatened to bring to the screen*.* 

With their graphic depiction of an attack by Comanches and taciturn protagonist, the Coens 'only' need to find their Judge Holden and they'd be well advanced in making such an adaptation reality. Alas this is probably as close as we'll get.

Pan shot!

&#x200B;

**Meal Ticket**

A pitch-black, highly cynical look at the fickleness of the entertainment industry, as the learned, vulnerable 'Wingless Thrush', 'Professor' Harrison, is eventually rendered redundant by a clever chicken. Liam Neeson's grimly pragmatic entrepreneur is utterly ruthless - and, as is the way in all matters, the lowest common denominator trumps artfulness.

&#x200B;

**All Gold Canyon**

Tom Waits' dogged, aging prospector disturbs the idyllic peace of a picturesque valley in his quest to strike gold.

Great to see such an iconic American figure like Waits in such a great role.

&#x200B;

**The Gal Who Got Rattled**

The centerpiece of this anthology, The Gal Who Got Rattled is, in it's utilitarian way, as romantic as I can remember the Coen brothers allowing themselves to get.

Zoe Kazan and Bill Heck's story of a love that is never allowed to fully bloom brings Steinbeck to mind; both the Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men. 

The uneasy feeling that the Coens will not allow the good-hearted pair the comfort they seek is teased out as Heck's Mr. Knapp touches upon the very 'uncertainty' that has become increasingly important to the brothers over the years (see also: The Man Who Wasn't There, A Serious Man). 

As with Inside Llewyn Davis, a recalcitrant animal is the impetus for much of the action,as yapping mutt President Pierce dodges fate, transferring his apparent doom to another poor soul.

&#x200B;

**The Mortal Remains**

I found this to be the slightest of the 6 tales, coming across a little too stagey for my liking. I am glad to read that others found more to enjoy here than I did.

The reason I bring this up is because I was lucky enough to catch this in an indie theater, and as much as I loved it, so much of the cgi was distractingly bad. 

The horrible blood splatter squibs,  the ""animals"" in the Tom Waits one, it just seems so unlike the perfectionism of all their other films. 

I can't help but believe there was a point in production where Ethan said ""hey, we're having some problems getting this practicle blood splatter effect to look right"" and Joel replied, ""fuck it.

It would also have made a stronger thematic connection across the stories, since Buster talks about the meanness of people and the absurdity/unpredictability of life in his ending monologue, both of which are in full display in the rest of the stories.

1. *The Gal Who Got Rattled*. The ending completely fooled me. Although the it dragged on a little bit, I was so impressed with that ending it takes my top spot. [I was sure Billy or Alice (or both) were playing the other for some unknown reason. No way were these two people just good souls out in the West. But, they were, which made that ending hit even harder.](#spoiler)

2. *The Mortal Remains*. Very unique take on death and ethical philosophy for me. That type of discussion is right up my alley.

3. *All Gold Canyon*. The agony I felt when the Prospector knew he was played is a testament, for me, to how good the Cohen Brothers are. I really liked how they portrayed the wildlife scattering. It was as if man was a natural disaster that keeps said wildlife away until it (in this case humans) passes.

4. *Meal Ticket*. This was the one I enjoyed watching the least, and if I were to recommend anyone to skip one of these stories it would be this one as well. However, the use of silence in this story was incredible! Never once did the duo ever talk to each other, and the tension and their relationship was understood very well despite that. Gut-wrenching story, but very well told/shown.

5. *The Ballad of Buster Scruggs*. [He died](#spoiler) just after he won me over as a character! Nonetheless, the message and symbolism in this story were awesome as well. I'm also not a huge fan of songs in movies, but I genuinely enjoyed them here. And don't let my ranking this story fifth fool you, I enjoyed this one just as much as the others in the top four. They were all close for my rankings. 

6. *Near Algodones*. It's not that I didn't like this story, but it just didn't intrigue me all that much either. Part of me wants to agree with most people in this thread that it's a tale about a man going after instrumental things like money and what can be bought with it vs intrinsic things like beauty or love. However, part of me thinks its more tied to life and death and the potential meaninglessness behind it. All Gold Canyon is a Jack London story, so if you exclude that, all the other stories really focused on death as the emotional weight of the story. But in this story he dies just as he seems to potential ponder about the girl. All in all, I just have a hutch the Cohen Brothers were trying to spotlight something other than a life of greed vs a life of love. But if not, I don't think they went about it all that well.

Again, 5/6 were *great* in my opinion. Awesome movie watching experience and I'm definitely going to recommend this to anyone and everyone!",9x1g48

I absolutely see where it could have been fleshed out into a six part miniseries, but it almost had more charm this way. It was gut punch after gut punch, beautiful scenery. It had everything.

ejy229r,"Buster sort of cheats in the shootouts.  In the classical western, the accepted protocol is the two guys are supposed to draw simultaneously, and whomever is faster on the draw & shoots straighter wins.  Buster has apparently figured out if he draws first, his life expectancy is a lot higher.  In the initial cantina shootout, the other guy asks Buster if he’s wearing a gun.  While the other guy is clearly anticipating a verbal answer, Buster just draws and puts a bullet in his head (and then proceeds to shoot the rest of them before they can process what’s happening...).  In the shootout scene with Surly Joe’s brother, Buster asks him whether he needs a count.  As soon as the brother says ‘no’, Buster shoots, again clearly before the guy is ready.  Draw before they’re ready is how Buster operates. Ironically, the Kid uses the same trick on Buster.  This time it’s the Kid asking Buster if he needs a count, and as soon as Buster casually responds, he’s got a bullet through his hat and his brain, clearly before he was ready.  Nice Coen brothers touch...

Meal ticket was near the bottom for me. I kept thinking the chicken would just be regular and the guy got scammed. It's sad and all but kinda draws on in the middle.

Gold canyon was perfect. Great pace. Great solo acting.

Panshot was one of the funniest lines along with dog hole. The bank monologue was amazing but I didn't like how it ended with him just wandering into death. 

Mortal reminder was the darkest and most confusing. The 3 are going to hell I assume... But I wish we had a bit more info. More time with them being scared in the carriage.

Ballad was the most awkward I think. I liked the songs more in the end, especially the last song. The horse riding in and first saloon scene just seemed pointless... And then it all ended way to fast. There didn't seem much to it, other than you get old and life passes you by. So enjoy it.

All and all great movie and interesting experiment with the chapters. I've see. Some Korean horror movies that do chapters like this it's always fun. The cheap cgi was fun. They had great actors. I'm not sure where it stands vs other coen brother movies... But it's probably not one of their top 5. Still I feel like they made it for a different medium and succeeded.

eawm0i8,"I'm really shocked that nobody has mentioned that these are the stories of the Seven Deadly Sins.  Is it that obvious that nobody is talking about it, or did I really just stumble in on that one?  ...and it's not just the story as a whole, but the theme in each story is represented many times and in various ways.  I just watched it for the first time tonight, and have a question about the very last story I'll place **below**, but I'll mark up a rough understanding and moments captured.

&#x200B;

* **The Ballad of Buster Scruggs -**  Pride... obvious. Even has a great poker hand, but doesn't play it (foreshadow French man story???). Even the guys that are the main initial targeted deaths are boasting.
* **Near Algodones -**  Greed... Bank Robbery. When asked if they could have his horse, he says no... they call him selfish. (this one I want to re-watch because I need to see more instances of greed hadn't made the connection until after gold canyon.) Maybe the amount of cookware the teller was wearing?... maybe not.
* **Meal Ticket**  \- Lust... Went with a cheap trick over substance, went to a brothel.
* **All Gold Canyon**  \- Envy...  Wanted to take the prospectors gold.  The way the Prospector talked to the gold pocket; wanting it. Wanted the eggs that the owl had.  Even having a conscience moment with the bird watching and putting the eggs back.
* **The Gal Who Got Rattled**  \- Gluttony... starting at a dinner table while everyone is eating. Rushing into making hasty decisions (marriage), they are always eating when they interrupting each other on the trail. High wage for the work boy. More land for a married couple. Hasty ending her life.
* **The Mortal Remains** \- Wrath... obvious from the definition, Divine retribution for sin.
* **(Nothing else)** \- Sloth... 6 stories is fine... we don't need to make a story for sloth \*yawn.... (this is my favorite way of representing the theme; loled when I made the connection.)

I want to re-watch because every time I have thought about a story it's just riddled with examples of their targeted Deadly Sin.  Whether it's literal, through imagery, an off comment, alternative definitions.  It's really fun and wish the movie came out while I was in my Script Writing class.  One can make an amazing paper from this movie.

&#x200B;

So... my only lost and puzzled moment of this entire movie as I've mentioned **above**.  The last story... I get that they are all dead.  I do not for the life of me understand the ""dead guy"" on the roof... and why there are two ""reapers"" (maybe there are just many and these are two that work together).  I had to go back to the first story quick just to see if it was these two guys that haul off Buster Scruggs after he's killed, it's not... wish it kind of was.

The only two things I can think about is that

1. The guy on the roof was killed that way so he remains that way on the coach... but if so he should have been squirming or yelling or something.
2. This wasn't a person, but only a soul... as they mention they capture souls as well... but then what would make the dead passengers that are featured if they are not souls too?

This body on the roof prevents me from wrapping this whole story up into a nice and awesome package.  What is the deal with the body on the roof?!  You can't be dead... while dead.  Help me! :)

&#x200B;

Edits: fixing stuff.

&#x200B;

EDIT: OK... my mind just exploded.  I was thinking about what the story was that the reaper was saying about how we want to put yourself into the story, its you but not you.  THE DEAD GUY ON THE ROOF IS YOU THE VIEWER!!! OMFG. Unless I hear better this is my solution!  You are the silent observer. He even hints at it with the ""Do they ever succeed (in knowing)."" ""I don't know, I was only watching"" comment.  HAHAHAHA  I feel so good about this.  He was the only one to be shown taken up the stairs and you as the viewer just transitioned/being carried to the end of the story.  THE END!

The ride itself is the reapers killing the passengers or taking their souls to be reaped by keeping them distracted and on the carriage so they don't realize where they are at to try to go back by jumping off and why the carriage doesn't stop. 

The random choking by the old lady didn't make sense unless it was her choking her last breath and with it being towards the end of the ride. The old lady also wearing all black like a widow would wear how she is talking about not having seen her husband in 3 years. Which is odd considering she said they are devout Christians which is a reason why she continued to wear black like some deeply religious widows were known to do and not having a reason to be split up from her husband. Having to live with her daughter sounds like something a widow would do because she had no ownership or personal income. 

The old lady also going on about a seeing a loved one in a present tense are the last thoughts or words a dieing grieving widow would have had in a conscious state and said to a loved one in her last breaths. Then right after with reaper even saying he just loves ""watching"" the victims of his die as they pass over which is exactly what he is doing and that the fact he mentions the best way to kill someone is to distract them in which all the passengers are until the rides over.

Now the ending part with tunnel of light at the top of the stairs i think signified them finally passing over along with a rather elegant interior in a nowhere ghost town.

The first story I didn't like that much. I think it was the singing and shooting the guys fingers off, and him flying to heaven.

Second story I wish was longer and was expanded on. I really like the first shot where the outlaw is looking at the bank and his coat is blowing in the wind.

Third story, I'm not sure. I understand that the guy could make more money off of a chicken that can do sums than his crippled performer. I just felt this one was lacking.

Fourth story was really nice. I liked the way he only took one egg. I liked the way it played on his conscious that the owl was watching. I liked the scenery to. It looked like a location in RDR2, the area with the twirly river near the mountains.

Fifth story I think is my favourite. I was quite invested in the girl. I wanted to know where her journey would take her. She seemed lost with what to do with herself. I was sad when she shot herself. I thought mister Arthur would get killed the Indians, and so I was shocked that he survived but the girl did not. She just did what everyone told her to do, or just said ok to everything.

Sixth story I didn't like. It had a spooky vibe to it. When the bounty Hunter talked about watching people die I thought he might try something with the passengers. Other people have pointed out they are all dead and the hotel is their resting spot. I think that is smart but I still didn't enjoy it all that much. When that lady started choking or having a stroke or a seizure (idk). If she's already dead why put that in there?

I give the film a 7/10. I would of been disappointed if I had watched in the cinema.

e9yjso4,"Just watched it and I'm still sort of ""digesting"" all of the different stories. It's difficult to process my overall enjoyment because each story kind of deserves to be judged on its own, but they all feel unified in how they tackle the theme of death, and it definitely feels like they were written to be part of the same bigger picture. As a whole, I mostly enjoyed different aspects of it but it also kind of left me feeling a little unsatisfied and unfulfilled in the experience. I'm not sure why exactly that is, because I think each short on its own is either good or great, for different reasons. But I think having them all together as an anthology kind of makes them comparatively hurt each other in different ways. For instance, the rapid-fire pacing and absurdity that makes ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" insanely fun to watch does a disservice to the slower burn ""Meal Ticket"" and ""The Gal Who Got Rattled,"" which I thought were arguably the two most substantive stories, even though they demanded a little more patience with regards to the pacing.

Maybe it was just the repetition of the themes of death and how every story (with one exception) ends with a heavy dose of irony, but it almost felt like each story kind of had the same outcome, even though they were different scenarios. The trademark Coen Brothers stylings carry you through most of it, but it got to the point where I was longing for a little more variety in terms of the emotional or thematic payoff for each story.

I think the only story that genuinely caught me off guard was ""All Gold Canyon,"" both in its themes and in how the plot carries out. I was so sure it was going to be a story about man coming into nature and utterly destroying something beautiful, peaceful, and perfectly harmonious, and having him being undone by his greed, but it doesn't really end like that at all. It played on my expectations in a way that the other shorts hadn't. There's no tragic irony at the end of that story, so it was actually refreshing.",9x1g48
ea0vpry,"The Mortal Remains is staying with me and I can't seem to shake it. One thing that I really can't figure out is the body.

e9udd6r,"I love the Coen's, but I just didn't care for this for the most part.  Short stories are hard to pull off and most of these just didn't click for me.

Jesus Christ, I can't even read Kinja blogs anymore because I just get blindsided by these stupid bloggers that have no original thoughts of their own so they manufacture outrage instead. 

Anyway, I thought it was a fantastic movie and loved every short story the Coen Brothers told. I think my favorite was the Prospector story, since it was about the only one that had a ""happy"" ending. They seemed to touch, albeit it briefly, on all the Wild West tropes they could cram pack into two hours. 

Overall a fantastic experience and I hope Netflix brings us more original movies like this going forward. ",9x1g48

It was so crisp and clear looking and the colors were so vibrant to the point that you could enjoy it just looking at the movie if it was playing in a department store with the sound off. This movie really shows that going Digital was the right choice for the Coen's and after watching this, I'd be happy to see them shoot more films digitally in the future. It's certainly earned a place in the top films of 2018 for me, but I'm not sure yet where I'd place it in the Coen's filmography and will probably have to rewatch it once or twice to cement where i'd rank it. I enjoyed all the stories, besides the last one (though I'll admit I was a little distracted near the end of the movie and should probably rewatch the last story again before writing it off) and I thought the first half of the caravan story was a little slow before the romance started to develop.  Though besides that, I thought it was an excellent movie.

Most movies shot on digital these days use grading and other techniques to approximate film, but they seem to have embraced digital this go around and the look is...strange. I kept checking to see if it was running at 30fps instead of 24 because it felt so odd. The composition and color were great, but I was distracted by the harsh digital feel for most of the film.",9x1g48

1. All Gold Canyon - Tom Waits killed it. Loved the relationship with the surroundings, the pursuit of wealth in an honest way. 
2. The Gal Who Got Rattled - The dialogue about (un)certainty resonated with me. Her mistake was her perceived certainty of her incoming fate. Feels like a reflection on the question of suicide. Two people finding and losing eachother beautifully.
3. Near Algodones - Young man similar to me fucking up.
4. The Mortal Remains- Nice conversation, interesting suspense.
5. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs - I didn't really like the casting of Buster. Nice music though.
6. Meal Ticket - a bit straightforward for my liking.

ea0wnv5,"There's some good stuff in it, especially the first two and the Tom Waits episode (which looked fucking gorgeous!), but overall it was far too long for my taste and some of the episodes fell flat. Meal Ticket had an interesting story (especially the very bleak ending) and good actors, but was a bit repetitive and The Mortal Remains just felt way too long and didn't really have a payoff. Maybe the overall pacing would've felt better, if you reordered the stories a bit, such that you don't have the two funniest in the beginning and afterwards mostly serious tales. 

In the end, it's a really well made film, with gorgeous visuals (although, I'm more partial to Deakins' cinematography, which generally feels a bit less artificial and stylised to me), great actors and the typical Coen-esque nihilism. Additionally, Carter Burwell's score is absolutely terrific. I'd like to say, it's one of the best he's done in years, but then I remembered, that he almost always delivers.

I’m on the last story now and I just don’t really get it - although I know there’s not much too “get”.

But on the other hand, where it lacks a singular narrative..it makes up in its charm, set pieces, costume design, humor, interesting characters (for the most part). Certain things bothered me though. Meal Ticket was okay, James Franco’s bit was meandering and annoying at best, the fifth story was quite too long by 6 minutes and while Buster was funny, it was kinda off putting and took me by surprise.

I really would have just enjoyed if the Coens directed another feature with a more fleshed out story line instead of putting so much effort into this, although I get it’s a passion project and theyprobably didn’t put that much effort into considering they’re brilliant and can probably piss out a  is a 7 or 8/10 movie with little effort.",9x1g48

But overall entertainment wise I found it weak.  The stories were interesting but qould drag on too long and story 5 was getting a bit boring till the end.

Not awful and interesting watch but not something I want to revisit again..I was expecting some of the stories to be on par with Coen films and while the stories were alright, they did not meet the Coens standard.

It reminded me a lot of The Ladykillers.  Both in entertainment, visuals and symbolism. Ladykillers had decent humor and some good undertones but its not a film I want to revisit besides the visuals and that is how I felt here

Visually amazing, I can’t get over the cinematography. Coens always have an eye for visuals and direction and no one brings the west to life like them.  It really made me miss westerns and makes me want to go buy Red Dead 2

e9vd8s3,"UNPOPULAR OPINION (apparently):  
""The Gal Who Got Rattled""...was horrible, achingly tedious, dull, annoying, badly written, and nauseatingly acted (looking at you, Zoe Kazan)--**until the end**, which almost redeemed the putrid Amish romance novel that preceded it.  
i mean, except for the kid walking backwards and the final segment, it didn't seem like a Coens movie at all.  

on paper, it might have seemed like a weird little ditty of a pioneer story: ""what if a couple of tenderfoot city slickers brought an annoying little dog with them on the Oregon Trail?""  
OK...but then you realize that every thing is just a plot point to bring about an utterly non-sequitur tragic ending (great as it is)--an ending that deserved a much better story.  
...and the primary blame can be placed on Zoe Kazan and/or her character: she *looked* perfect for the part...but the part sucked. SO dull, SO undramatic, SO annoying--everything Mattie in *True Grit* was but much worse.  
i'm sorry...but the Coens can simply *not* write women, and they should stop trying--not that they try very often.

My main beef is with the script. It's like a Grimm's Fairy Tales for the west. That means random instances, dark humor, and usually death. Except death doesn't always have to be dark and depressing, which is proven in the first act. (Still don't understand why Tim Blake Nelson was floating off in mini angel wings and harp, but there's the Coen brother's for you.) But like Grimm's, they are short, bizarre, and left a bad taste in my mouth.
1) The main character is an outlaw, goes into a town and loses a gunfight.
2) The main character is an outlaw, escapes being hung and then gets hung. 
3) Liam Neeson upgrades to the newest iPhone.

The third act was disturbingly bleak, ending with more death. It wasn't fun to watch a quadriplegic live a depressing existence, only to be snuffed out. It wasn't entertaining, insightful, or needed.",9x1g48

Next time you go camping, watch Bone Tomahawk first, and consider that there have been a few instances of men coming out of the woods after disappearing in them for up to 30 years lately. Now imagine you know they're out there, they're organized, and they certainly don't like you. You'll sleep in your car for sure.

Absolutely tragic what the united states and others did to native americans. That seems to have been the theme from the 60s onward. But now I think it is an interesting bit of realism to show in film exactly how formidable the native americans could be. I think those scenes, in the least, are singularly exciting. ",9x1g48

In Mortal Remains, it’s clear that the three passengers are thrown together for the only purpose of tormenting one another, as the two reapers, unaffected by the squabble, watch for their passengers to “figure it out.” I didn’t understand a lot of this movie but this final piece captivated me so greatly that I had to run to Reddit to see if I was the only one who was so oddly compelled by these tales.",9x1g48

The religious lady in the cart says she is going to meet his husband (who’s dead as we know from the song). 
The Old man is the only one that makes it out alive but I do think that there’s a reason to that. The owl is the man’s guardian angel as it’s the only animal that stays when he arrives.

It starts out seeming like all the others just a story about some people but what's unusual is that the mustached man occasionally glances directly into the camera at the viewer.  Then when night falls the man stares prolonged, directly into the camera as he talks about loving to distract people with his stories.  At that moment we feel like we're all in the carriage, watching a story to distract us with some kind of meaning that we derive only from experiences in our own lives while death is always sneaking up to thump us unexpectedly; all while we are distracted from our mortality (""I live forever"").  I think the bit about whether or not people ever find meaning in it all is kind of a nod to the previous stories.  None of them have any clear meaning.  At least that's the eerie feeling I got from it.

The Cohens seem to love nihilistic themes.  Like with The Meal Ticket.  The orator has no real personality outside of his performances.  He just stares speechless, neither happy nor sad.

 But I thought it was explained a bit in the last story when the Frenchman is telling the other passengers about a poker game. He was once asked by his friend to play for him and objected, saying we all must play our own hand. I cannot bet on behalf of someone else, because how they would bet is an accumulation of all their experiences up to that hand of poker. Basically fancy way of saying we can not know eachother because we do not share each other's experiences. we all must live our own lives. We can't have someone stand in and make our decisions for us, and can't be expected to make decisions for others.

So I thought perhaps skruggs declined to play another man's hand cuz it was not he who anted. It isnt his hand, he shouldnt be forced to play it, despite it being a strong hand. 

What's funny though, is there's a Frenchman at the table in scruggs' story who insists that, because scruggs has regarded the man's hand before declining, it is too late and he must play them. The two Frenchmen are similarly dressed, although different actors. I thought maybe this is a younger version if the man in the stagecoach. Although, they have different POVs on playing another man's hand. Maybe it shows the frenchman's opinion has changed over time? Or it could be a coincidence.

There’s no way anything in the saloon went down like that - it’s absurd because his version is so warped, he’s actually just like everyone else. 

The visual storytelling in the shootout scene was great, too - how you didn’t see the gunshot through his head until after he’d deduced his injury from his hat. 

Without this interpretation, I would agree with you. I thought it set the tone though. The rug gets pulled out from under you in each story, whether it’s a trick of the main character or because you’re desperately hoping for the best, and instead you get the worst.

He diligently did what it took and marked his progress by trying-failing-fixing as we all must do to earn an honest level of success. He found what worked and narrowed it down through trial and error to find the pocket. This large chunk of gold was not stumbled upon and seized but earned through working tirelessly and doing it the right way. When he returns the 3/4 eggs, he sees the red eyed owl which revealed the greediness of his actions. Upon realizing his mistake, he returned them,but kept one indicating that we as humans, no matter what, are not perfect and need a little something to keep motivated/sustained. He clearly was a good person with incredible work ethic, and he deserved to enjoy the fruits of his labor, unlike the kid who poached a great opportunity by shortcuts and devious tactics.

The pair of ""bounty hunters"" are actually carrying out the things they say they do to their targets WHILE they are describing them: They sing, they tell stories to amuse, etc. (the big guy doesn’t need to smack them because they are already dead) this becomes very apparent when the small guy is saying how much he likes to watch their targets in the eyes, just as they are starting to come to grips with reality, and just at this moment the one of the stranger says ""do they ever succeed?"" kinda implying that they are starting to understand as well but having a hard time with it.

ed8ve30,"The last one is a meant for us to examine who we are. 3 characters make 3 very different propositions about the nature of humanity. Ending with a rather heated argument. Clearly these three character have vastly different ideas on human nature. 

Then the Englishman lets us all know that it doesn't matter. We all end up in the same place at the end, after convincing ourselves that we will never die. 

And so it goes that the 3 vastly different character all end up in the same hotel at the end of the story. 

Now whether the hotel is pergatory, the afterlife, or just a hotel, is up for interpretation. And what exactly that dead corpse is suppose to mean is beyond me. 

But the last story is social commentary on how we view ourselves vs others, and why we appreciate stories such as these.

ea0fbve,"This is the entire reason I even bothered to check out the Reddit discussion. Hoping someone would have an answer that was a solid ""no""",9x1g48
ea27neo,"Meal ticket for me was one of the most thought-provoking segments in the movie. And I agree that when Liam Neeson said “once”, that was probably the most meaningful part of the segment although it’s debatable about what that meeting is. I do not think that he raped the actor. I would agree that if he had done that there’s no reason he would’ve only done it once. To me the build up before the scene maybe could help with understanding what happened.  It is interesting to me that before Liam Neeson got drunk that they were making money but never really talked. The owner of the show seem sympathetic towards the actors maybe even guilty. And the actor never questioned the owner about any decisions he made throughout the entire segment. Almost as if he felt he deserved whatever was happening without question. When the pair start making less money Liam Neeson gets drunk and then goes to the prostitute. The word “once” seems to verbalize an underlying resentment And the actor again never replies. My interpretation is that the “once” that the actor had sex somehow harmed Liam Neeson’s character whether it was with his wife or daughter or some other loved one. And perhaps the Sex that the actor had, led in someway the death of that loved one possibly even by Liam Neeson’s hands in an act of jealousy and also leading Liam Neeson to dismember the Actor  only them to feel guilty about it later and then try to provide some semblance of a livelihood with the actor in a traveling show. Once the money runs dry then Liam Neeson‘s character becomes progressively more and more bitter about whatever started their relationship leading him to the end of the segment where he throws the actor from the Cliff. Just one interpretation but it is one that for me would explain the relationship between the two characters throughout the whole segment.",9x1g48

ea18ci2,As grim a thought as it is I came to the same conclusion. The scene comes at a pivotal moment where you realize he doesn’t truly care about Harrison.  He’s a means to the end and knowing how it ends I found it plausible that Liam Neesons character would have once taken advantage of him in a moment of drunken desperation. ,9x1g48
eafz97h,"I interpreted that as a sign of how their relationship had gone downhill. Presumably when they first met Liam viewed him as an actual human being. They talked. Even got whores together. But as Liam has to take care of him the relationship goes downhill until its drudgery and and frustration from Liam and desperation and anxiety from the performer. There's no more joy in either of them. 

I think we see other signs of this as well. Liam rushing him to eat bites of food because he doesn't want to wait - forcing soup that's too hot on the performer for the same reason - and forgetting  (almost) to turn him around with the prostitute. I think we can fairly assume if Liam almost forgot to turn him, then there are previous times where he did turn him out of courtesy when there still was some - and presumably - a time where the guy even got his own whore. 

We never see Liam show any sexual interest in the performer, and there would be time to show that during the pee scene.

I think its more a reference to the degeneration of their relationship, and how the performer is no longer a human being to Liam. ",9x1g48

ea5lifx,"To me they are crossing over, the carriage, the rider is the ferrymen taking their souls to the other side.

The three characters are dealing with their death. The reason the woman hasn't seen her husband in 3 years is because he died, but now she's there to meet him. Strong vibes of the Twilight Zone episode [The Passerby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Passersby), in that all characters understand in some level they are dead, but refuse to admit it and will do all sorts of justifications to avoid the subject. This is why the woman says her husband was on the East, the trapper says his partner ""just left"", and note that they are called bounty hunters by the trapper, and merely take on the point. Still you see at various points they understand what is happening (the lady again remarks that they need to go in, as she is to see her husband).

The characters talk and try to justify their existence, with their death hinted, but never quite said. The Trapper justifies his actions by implying we're animal and that instinct is all there is. The woman instead counters that there's a morality, a right and wrong about what is to happen to us. The french-man counters that it's all relative and people's definition of good and bad is depending on what is convenient and good for us, that there's no moral absolute, he's a gambler and seems to bet on not knowing what happens on the other side. The characters discuss, as if any of this matter: they are dead and will get whatever comes to them. In the end, no matter what they said, they are all afraid, the trapper merely moves forward as he does but understands in a way a ferret couldn't, the lady says her husband is waiting but cannot open the door afraid to face who she truly was, and the french-man wonders if there's a way back, realizing there isn't and that it's time to see how his bet (Pascal's wager) payed off.

The story is very ambiguous, it gives us no answers. The two characters seem morally ambiguous, it's never clear if they are good or evil, only threatening (as death is). It seems the Englishman lies, even though he sings at first and tells a story, it's the song of his partner the Irish that distracts everyone, and the only one that thumps is the Englishman. The Irishman seems to be the one that makes the other characters feel better. When he tells the story with the knocking and conversation at midnight it frightens the lady terribly more than others, but everyone becomes disturbed later, maybe as they all finally understand. And maybe that's the point, it's not clear or obvious who is good or bad, of it's that clear, but there is a reckoning in death. This isn't about death justifying our lives, but of what is left and what that means. Indeed in the end we're not sure if they are dead or merely went through a trip that brought the subject up. Like the characters: how could you know if you were dead?",9x1g48

He is an insanely skilled killer, but will never kill unless provoked.  He also lives by a strict moral code that prevents him from lying or cheating (playing another mans hand included.)  Add two and two together and you have the result.

During their conversations the gambler says there's only 2 types of people the lucky and the unlucky. Buster is lucky until his overconfidence gets the better of him and his luck runs out. James franco is clearly very unlucky, escaping one bad situation just to wind up in another one.

The women talks of the upright and the sinners. The man with no arms or legs is ironically always sitting upright and speaks stories from the bible, Shakespeare, etc. The sinner would be in the next story as the man who shoots Tom waits in the back. Another connection with the living is that Liam's Neeson tosses away his failing meal ticket for a scam that most likely leads to no money for him while Tom waits works and perseveres for his meal ticket in gold mining.

Now the trapper just says all people are the same, they're like ferrets. So, the brother and sister both die in this episode. They're complete opposites. One very sure of themselves yet a failure and the other is nervous and wishy washy as she says. Yet death still comes for them both. I just take this as there doesn't have to be a rhyme or reason, death comes to all.

This was a story about how we all have our own agenda, hours we constantly label good vs evil and how we use that to justify our own ends. But frankly in the end,  it doesn't matter. What matters is how you treat people and those that are around you. It's no surprise the  only person who survived is the prospector. He is the only person who respected anything.  He respected the owl,  he respected the earth,  he respected the gold..

ea5vs89,"This is my most favorite of the stories. As all ready mentioned before you got two reapers farring souls. A few things to notice. 


1) The trapper asks them if there bounty hunters but they never confirm to this preferring to be called reapers of souls fealing the term is to negative. 


2) They allow the passangers to discuss morals through the trip but never join in them selves. The short starts at sunset with golden light bathing the characters as the story progresses and gets more creepy the color pallet moves to dark blue and black. This was a fantastic choice in keeping with the mood. A thick fog at the end wall our characters off from the rest of the world.


3) We see the trapper equate ppl to animals driven by instinct, the French man by change and deception, and the lady by moral codes set by God. When the reapers are asked they see people two ways alive or dead. When asked if they bring ppl in alive the English man says no. This further solidifies there roles. When the lady is caughing and the driver is asked to pull over the English man tells them they can not. His bounty is dead and there not on a time table so why not pull over...? Notice how we NEVER see the face of the driver and he's never interacting with the three souls. He helps the reaper with the door to get in but never interacts with the guests.


4)  Another great choice is the hotel it self. When there entering the lobby notice the decorations above the door. One is of a maiden like Angel and the other of a goat's head like demon. This is a place where all souls arrive be them good or bad. When we look into the hotel there is no one ells inside. The atriem should have some kind of activity or a clerk but it's empty and leads to one direction a stair case bathed in white light with mist coming from it that the reapers are carrying there body up through. When the camera reverses and we see the stage coach leave we also notice the three souls have 0 lugage with them. This is all there first time to fort worth (and only time if you know what I mean). As the French man sees the coatch leave we see the buildings in the town are obviuse props makeing the hotel the only location we know of in the town and what the reapers refer to that they all will be staying in.


5) The Irish man's song wrapped the whole event together. He sings it every time according to the English man when there making the passage to fort worth which they been to many times. It's about a body being wrapped up after it's dead. Kind of like the body on top of the coach.

The part that puzzles me is why two reapers? Was it to disguise the idea that there bounty hunters with one being bait and one being the killer? If The reaper fairies souls is one Fate which is there to set down when you will die? The Irish man points out the English man is in charge and all I can think is it would be much easier to handle the bodies with two ppl.

I truly loved this story and felt the shots, set design, and simple premise was a great way to end these series of short story's. As the reaper said we love spooky stories because we are safe. We love stories about our selves but when the thing from out side gets us we are safe on the other side of the page/screen.

eay16me,"Wow the idea that the “cargo” on the roof in The Mortal Remains is the viewer is a very interesting idea. I thought that the man on the roof was an upright individual going to heaven (both because he’s on top of the wagon and because the Irishman and Englishman drag him up the stairs of the hotel and into a blinding light). Within the wagon, it’s obvious the Irishman’s song causes the Lady, Trapper, and Frenchman to cross over. When they enter the hotel, its lobby is dark, red, and has a fire. I believe the lobby itself could be Purgatory or Hell, not sure which, but each of the three non-reaper passengers have issues which would likely prevent them from going to Heaven. The Lady is extremely proud, to the point of hubris, and refuses to take seriously any of the ideas offered by her companions. She upholds her husband in an idolized fashion, and can not comprehend him (who has obviously already “crossed over” three years prior) leaving her for another. The Frenchman sinned by gambling, as the Lady points out, and could be viewed as greedy or envious (given the earnings of others he plays while gambling or the negative way in which he frames the Lady’s seemingly stable relations with her family). Finally, the Trapper obviously engaged in premarital sex, another historical sin the Lady is disgusted by, perhaps demonstrating lust through his “ferrets” analogy and assertion the world revolves around sex. The Englishman (who I think to be the Devil) grows amused by each individual attempting to explain their worldview, minimizing their own faults while exacerbating the flaws of the others. The Irishman, in my mind, is the Grim Reaper (or the god of Death), while the coachman is Charon, the ferryman of souls to the Underworld.",9x1g48

""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs and other Novels"" would work as well. My copy of ""War of Worlds and other Novels"" has  ""The Time Machine"", ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"", ""The Invisible Man"", ""The War of the Worlds"", ""The First Men in the Moon"", ""The Food of the Gods"", and ""In the Days of the Comet"". 

Or ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs and other Stories"" would work like the book ""I am Legend and other Stories"" that has ""I am Legend"" which is only 160 pages long as well as the stories called ""Buried Talents"", ""The Near Departed"", ""Prey"", ""Witch War"", ""Dance of the Dead"", ""Dress of White Silk"", ""Mad House"", ""The Funeral"", ""From Shadowed Places"", ""Person to Person""

In theory, you could expand each of these stories into a full movie like what was done with a lot of Philip K. Dicks short stories work:

* ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" is a short story turned into the movie ""Total Recall""

I almost died once. Had to be revived in the hospital. While I couldn't so much as open my eyes, I was conscious for almost all of it and as such I had the chance to essentially experience the first stages of dying - what it feels like when those elevator doors shut. You find that you're all alone in there and that nobody else and nothing else is in there, no matter how attached you were to them or those things. 

My favorite line from any song ever written is from Pancho and Lefty by Townes Van Zandt:

""Nobody heard his dying words
That's the way it goes.""

That is the way it goes. Van Zandt knew it. The Coens know it. One moment you're here, the next you're not. 

At the end, we don't get a chance to figure it out and wrap it all up and say what we want to say, what we meant to say all along. Mostly we just go limp all of a sudden, like I did, and collapse in the arms of a loved one or on the street or in a crumpled car or on a hospital bed, without so much as a word. 

If you want meaning, if you want clarity, if you want understanding, you have to do it now and do it always. While the lights are on and you can talk. Almost none of us do this hard work, though, and thus we fade out, confused and unfinished. This is how I interpret the Coens' work and why I like it so much.

They are subtle and dont treat the viewer like an idiot, but they're not cryptic either. Maybe you don't like the ending or think it's stupid, but it's still an ending. Some of their films do end without wrapping up the story neatly or with a cool twist, but the story's intent is still clear.

2. Meal Ticket - This felt less like a dramatic narrative than a haunting tone poem. This is the Coens at their darkest and most nihilistic. Though it isn't an easy watch, I placed it at #2 for its sheer evocative power, accomplished with barely any narrative and dialogue (except for the artist's monologues).

3. Buster Scruggs - Several laugh-out-loud moments and an insanely entertaining and articulate central character make this the most entertaining of the six. This doesn't have much of a narrative arc, but just hanging out with the character is pure fun.

4. The Mortal Remains - Interesting mix of the usual conversation-in-a-carriage scenario with fantastical elements. (""Spooky"" might not be inappropriate here.) This was also the most philosophical of the six, in its exploration of life, death, interpersonal understanding, etc. Also worth mentioning is the touching moment when Brendan Gleeson sings. 

5. All Gold Canyon - Beautiful imagery, and the slow build-up towards the discovery of the gold pocket was really well-done. The discovery feels meaningful partly because of the time the Coens took to get there. Like Meal Ticket, this also seems more like a tone poem than a dramatic story. You can almost feel the air in the valley while watching this.

Buster is a Gene Autry character in a Sergio Leone movie. He's convinced himself he is the only righteous person. The man in black is more honest.

Despite also being a character from a Gene Autry movie, he is more suited to the 'life is cheap/survival at any cost' world they find themselves in.

But then after nightfall the mustached man looks directly into the camera for a prolonged time while he talks about distracting people from their mortality with little stories while his friend sneaks up to thump them.  At that point the 4th wall is broken and it's as if we're not just watching the characters in the chariot; we're in the chariot too heading to the end of our lives while we are distracted by our searches for meaning in the lives of others.  The driver never stops because life never stops until we reach our final destination.


Also interesting:  When they get to the hotel there are fixtures at the top of each of the doors.  Above the left door is an angel and above the right door is a goat.  When they carry the dead man in the door with the goat is the only one that opens.  I think the reason why the others are alive is because they made it into heaven which is described as life everlasting.  Of course the doors both go to the same place so maybe that suggests however you live your life you end up in the same place regardless.  The pious woman, the drunken trapper, the hedonistic Frenchman, and the dead wanted man all ended up in the same place.

While I wasn’t as disappointed as you were, I did find the whole “movie” - if you can call if that - was somewhat...pointless? I’m on the last story now and I just don’t really get it.

But on the other hand, where it lacks a singular narrative..it makes up in its charm, set pieces, costume design, humor, interesting characters (for the most part). Certain things bothered me though. Meal Ticket was okay, James Franco’s bit was meandering and annoying at best, the fifth story was quite too long by 6 minutes and while Buster was funny, it was kinda off putting and took my by surprise.

I really would have just enjoyed if the Coens directed another feature with a more fleshed out story line instead of putting so much effort into this, although I get it’s a passion project and probably didn’t put that much effort into considering they’re brilliant and can probably piss out a  is a 7 or 8/10 movie with little effort.",9x1g48

The chicken couldn't really do sums. Someone was holding something behind the spoons so the chicken would peck at it. It was a trained chicken at best, not a genius chicken. 

And I thought that one of the morals was that fads come and go. At the beginning of the bit, Liam Neeson and Harrison were making lots of money, but then towards the end they weren't making anything. The chicken made lots of money when Neeson bought it, but assuming he can even keep up with the trick (which he needs someone else to do, and which he might not even be aware of), people are going to get bored with the chicken soon too.",9x1g48

Which makes their conversations about morality in the stagecoach all the more interesting, especially the ""reapers"" don't really engage with the discussion.

He saw him as an oddity that he had to care for, but that's about it. You can see it when he feeds the artist or when the artist has to relieve himself. He does that for the artist, but he does it without great care.

He starts each oration with the story of Ozymandius - an ode to even empires of the past eventually crumbling (like our written or spoken traditions). The crowds shrink, and the demand for great storytelling gives way to a cheap trick. Like in the whorehouse - he was only loved once, and that’s it.

This isn't a 2 hour long story where the good guy has to live so the show can go on. Anyone can die.

It'd seem to make more sense given their personalities, and also, despite what you'd assume about Mr. Thorpe's moral fiber in life, the staircase they haul him up at the end with the bright light strikes me more as symbolic of heaven than hell.  Maybe, despite being a wanted outlaw, Mr. Thorpe was still good enough at heart to be deemed worthy of heaven.  Maybe that's the idea, that the judgement of heaven and hell is something beyond our comprehension, with reasons that transcend the laws of man.  I mean, Buster Scruggs would appear to have also gone to heaven in the reality of this movie, and he was a pretty murderous SOB.  Maybe this is also why the Englishman simply says ""I suppose he'll stay in your room""; perhaps it was a close and somewhat arbitrary decision.

Although the other interesting thing is, whatever is up the stairs (heaven or not), it appears to be the only place there is to go.  There doesn't appear to be an equivalent place symbolic of ""hell"" (unless it's the parlor, but if anything that seems more like it might be some sort of purgatory).  Also, it's not Clarence alone who carries Mr. Thorpe up the stairs, both men carry him.  Maybe (and to me this does seem like the more Coen-ish thing to do) the point is that we all end up at the same place, regardless of where we think we're going, and regardless of what we ""deserve"".  We like to imagine there's some grand battle between good and evil, God vs. the devil, but really they're just one and the same, both doing one job, ""harvesting souls"".

Good or evil, rich or poor, French or American, refined socialite or grizzled mountain man, we all end up at the same place.  All we can really do is just hope it's a place where men aren't low-down and poker is played fair.",9x1g48

e9v3cb4,"I believe the entire movie was meant to put a spotlight on a few very specific facets of human nature that we don't see talked about in movies very often due to how heavy of topics they are. 

The first story is about human ego and how there will always be someone better than you. Buster Scruggs is an extreme version of the ""western hero"". He walks into town and behaves like a god among men with no fear, a perfect shot, and a singing voice that can make a crowd dance around. He seems invincible and larger than life. He kills a lesser man in a duel in an over-the-top way. And then suddenly someone comes in and kills him off just like that and then Buster's body is dragged off and forgotten and life moves on as if he never existed.

The second story is about the absurdity of life. The scene starts with a bank in the middle of nowhere, which makes no sense. The bank teller is an absurd character who speaks in a wacky way and then ends up surprising the robber by coming out guns-ablazin with pans on himself. Then the people hanging the robber ask if they can have his horse. Then the Indians come in and save him unintentionally. Then a guy illegally driving cattle (???) saves him again. And then he ends up hanged anyways for that. It's intentionally a series of absurd events and it makes the world seem topsy-turvy and all chaos. Then, just before his death, the robber stops his world from spinning for a moment by making a simple, mundane observation: ""Now there's a pretty girl."" 

The third story is about how humans are capable of objectifying other human beings when it comes to business. Think of the CEO of a Fortune 100 company who sees their employees as salary figures in a budget that need to be reduced in order to turn a profit. Business is a cold thing. Liam's character kills off his ""employee"" as coldly as a CEO might lay off a lot of workers who have become obsolete.

The fourth story was in my opinion the most straight forward. It was about how human beings are the only creatures that will pillage the land to the point of ruining it for others. It was meant to show how strange of creatures we are. The deer, the fish, the butterflies, and the owl all were in peace near the stream. And then the human comes in and begins pillaging the land. And then another human comes in and attempts murder. These are unnatural things compared to the prior status quo.

I'm not exactly sure about the fifth story, but I think the point was to show how humans can find themselves suddenly in very dangerous situations. It reminded me of a friend who was mugged once and he talked about he just was powerless in that moment and never would've expected it. We live such peaceful lives that we are completely unprepared when we suddenly find ourselves in situations where people want to harm us. 

The sixth story is obviously about people being brought to the afterlife and dealing with the realization that they've died.

e9y2ze3,Indeed :(,9x1g48
e9ypvoy,"The story is not about the traveling act.  It’s about the relationship between the two.  The performer is limbless and relies on the man to feed him and get him about.  Once the man realizes this performer is not worth the efforts to feed him, or help him piss, etc he gets rid of him.  So no, it’s not about capitalism in the literal sense; it’s about the part of human nature that quantifies others’ value to you.  The man went all in on the chicken when he realized he could make more money and put forward less effort.

I took it as a normal scene, literal, but with parallels to death/grim reaper/afterlife. 

The Frenchman kept saying in the beginning that he was the master of his own fate, he plays the hand that is dealt, he can only play his own hand, and he cannot wager for another man. The final scene, looking into the hotel, he is truly challenged in this belief. And him smugly slapping on his hat and strutting into the hotel while smirking is just him passing the test of his own mortal philosophy. That everything is his own doing. That he is the only one to make his choices. He stood true to his principles. And he stepped into the hotel. 

I didn’t think he was dead or anything; I took the scene literally. I would love to hear someone write out why they think everyone was dead.

Hence, a “dog hole.” Mr. Arthur notes the Native Americans’ relative lack of skill in fighting, deriding their strategy, which soon proves true as multiple Natives’ horses step into the prairie dog holes and fall (breaking their legs and rendering them and their riders harmless). Thus, Mr. Arthur finds the Natives’ falling victim to the “dog holes” darkly humorous.",9x1g48

I'd just like to add to this, the fact that the camera in this scene stays at a pretty even distance from all the characters for every moment of this scene *except* for this exact moment.

He insenuates that every man must live their own life, and that no one else can possibly know your life.

Mrs. Benjamin certainly represented judgement against others. For having her entire character be about how she sees herself, how she sees others, and how she expects to be treated. 

The trapper is a bit stranger. He seems to represent not complex individuality like the frenchman, nor class systems with judgement like the lady. The trapper seems to think that all humans are just animals and the same. They all just want to eat and sleep and mate. And everything else is just an attempt to try and makeyourself appear different, when in reality we are all ferrets.

Franco’s character complained about that pan-wearing sumbitch didn’t fight fair, my guess is the Indians would say the same of Arthur. Yet Arthur and the banker are alive.

It feels like the Coens have a bias toward competent people who play games they know they can win. Buster was competent but was playing a game you ultimately will lose (and he seems to have accepted that). Franco seemed too honorable for an outlaw, the longenbaugh’s were too naive, the miner stayed in his lane and didn’t bother anyone else more than he had to, including nature. the orator (I’m just assuming here) seemed entitled to adoring fans even when his audience were illiterate settlers who don’t care about whatever shit he’s going on about. He’s so stuck to his idea of art that he divorces it from entertainment and commerce, which is ultimately a game you can’t win.

Also it loosely reminded me of the old gunslingers in Jim Boy Calloway's stories, and the bank robbery of Dutch's Plans

* Then **""All Gold Canyon""** with the gold prospector made me realize I've been that guy in Red Dead, standing next to a gold prospector and as soon as he found gold I shot him and robbed him. It made me watch it from the other poor soul's perspective and it was awesome.

The other three stories I liked for different reasons, **""Meal Ticket""** felt like it went on for a little too long, like I got the idea of audience going down, no need to repeat it so many times.

The Impressario represents studio heads, the wingless thrush is the metaphorical Coen brothers.

ea79cgj,"In addition to what the other poster commented about the two drivers: I believe they are also there to represent human nature and the attempted departure into ""godhood"" or intellectualism.

This whole story is about coming to terms with who (and why) you are.  The three passengers represent different casts, while the two drivers represent what we all have in us, always.  One can come to terms with existence through love, while the other is constantly questioning and will never truly come to a conclusion.

For me this mirrors one of the two states I constantly find myself in.  When I have a significant other I feel content with life, no longer asking why.  When alone the questions never end and and there is no answer.  Like the thin reaper says,  ""You never truly know"" if they come to terms with their death. The large reaper, on the other hand, is content with dying as long as he is around his loved ones.

Edit: Buster actually has reached enlightenment (godhood), as he displays in the one of the first lines of the film.

""I don't hate my fellow man even when he's tiresome and truly and tries to cheat at poker, I figure that's just the human material."" 

He understands.  He doesn't question.  He knows what he is.

Edit2: Holy shit I just started this film for the second time today and the beginning is rife with mirrors.  In ONE sentence he alludes to at least two other vignettes. 

Right after he kills the people in the first bar he doesn't finish off one of the outlaws in one bullet.  He says ""Whoops missed anything important, I'll leave it to the wolves.""

I could ramble on about the metaphor of a big open sky actually being a prison of loneliness, yada yada yada, but I digress.

The iconic dark blocking of the shot is often paid homage to in modern westerns as a nod to how much we owe John Ford. It is used often everytime the game resets in *Westworld* with Dolores waking up.

Everyone who is in purgatory *is* going to heaven, that's the point of it. Some will just be there for longer than others due to the sins they've committed (even ones they've confessed - but since they've confessed they aren't going too Hell instead, purgatory is basically a loophole blocker so people wouldn't just keep sinning and confessing), while buying indulgences from the Church can lessen the time for yourself or for another you choose. People who are going to hell go straight to hell, no purgatory involved. Hell being just a state of eternal separation from God, hence why Satan in Hell (but he isn't actually the ruler of it).

The three argue over what is right. The trapper believes all humans are the same, the woman believes people are good or bad based upon if they live by a code, and the Frenchman believes people are different (for example, he didn’t love you because you and him think of love different).

The bounty hunters are literal soul collectors are taking a person who’s fate is decided to the afterlife. They serve the purpose of showing the one common denominator to each person, despite their opinions; everyone dies and it’s more about how we embrace it. 

Now for my favorite part....They say it’s fun watching how a person reacts upon death....and then you get to see EXACTLY how the other three react to it!

The woman, still wanting a code, insist that the other follow decorum (help me down and get the door for me). Despite living this way, she reluctantly enters, uncertain of what will happen.

The trapper doesn’t live by the code, but because he believes all humans are the same, does whatever he needs to help her along, even though he shares the same reluctance.

The Frenchman, upon realizing the driver has left and he has no options but to enter, realizes he can either do so with fear or embrace it, choosing the latter.

Also, it's not Clarence alone who carries Mr. Thorpe up the stairs, both men carry him.

I think the Coen Bros added this line to show the growing disconnect between the two characters, and add that they clearly had a backstory / history together. By saying / knowing he had once in his life had sex, it implies he knows him well to be aware of such a personal thing, making it more difficult when you see he was tossed over for the chicken.

e9v8x1f,"I do like it more than Fargo. That by no means means I dislike Fargo. It’s in my top 20. You’re right about the multiple viewings but I just loves Miller’s whole aesthetic. The slang words that never existed, The characters who didn’t have to say much yet you knew who they were. I hate using the phrase “world building” but the Coens created this fictional “city with no name” that felt lived in by its characters. They achieve this feeling by not dumbing down any of the dialogue and having the characters speak to each other exactly how people who knew each other would speak (not explaining everything) while still having a fictional place to do whimsical things that couldn’t really happen. I don’t know if I’m explaining it right but it felt real and fantastical at the same time. And that’s WHY it takes a second viewing to understand what’s going on, and then a viewing to actually sit back and enjoy the genius of what they did. It’s hard to convince someone to watch a film multiple times, which is why you don’t see Miller’s Crossing show up on many “Best Of Coens” list, but to me it should be right at the very top for its script alone. Also I think that the Coens put so much into that script (They suffered writers block halfway through it and went on to write Barton Fink in between as it was a kind of catharsis for them) that it shows in every line of dialogue. It’s a truly special film, and anyone that enjoys double cross crime stories (though it’s much more than that) should definitely give it a go, and if you don’t get it on first viewing, wait a few months and watch it again. By the way, I’ve only spoken of the script but this film has some of the best costume, set design, sound, and oh my god music, that you’ll see. And last, but certainly not least, the cinematography is absolutely incredible, but that credit is due to Barry Sonnenfeld who in my opinion was never better. Sorry for the rant but I love this film and you asked why I liked it more than Fargo and that’s the shortest response a film lover like me could give.

Hudsucker proxy is about  classic good vs evil. 
Good allows time to move forward,  evil is always looking to stop it.

The big lebowski imo had more in common with buster Scruggs than any other movie,  in the same vein as a case study on karma.

I interpreted the last segment as the passengers either currently experiencing death with their “souls” en route to the afterlife or recently having died. They are reflecting on their lives and trying to justify their choices while the coachman, who never stops (Time/Death) delivers them to their final destination. On the doors to Fort Morgan are a cherub and a goat, maybe signifying heaven and hell (the goat being Baphomet). The ride takes place at sunset and ends in the night, with a pale blue tint on everything, casting an unnatural skin tone on the passengers.

They shot is almost entirely out of doors and it involved hundreds of special effects shorts. Getting all of the shots to match and the effects to integrate probably took a lot of tweaking, and it didn't end up looking very naturalistic. It was also their longest movie, so maybe all of the digital work was a bit overwhelming? I also noticed in the credits that they edited the movie on Adobe Premiere. Is that what they used for color correction?

I have no idea why it didn't look as great as their other films, although it could have something to do with the fact that this one wasn't shot by Roger Deakins or Emmanuel Lubezki, or all of the digital work. Bruno Delbonnel is a terrific cinematographer, but Deakins and Lubezki are geniuses and this movie obviously had a very heavy amount of digital manipulation and technical challenges.

e9ziv60,"You keep repeating that it has nothing to do with capitalism, but you’re not even refuting any of the points.  You also keep making the point about things existing before capitalism which is irrelevant.  Just because greed or sociopathy existed before capitalism does not mean that the use of greed or sociopaths in a story preclude the story from being a critique on something.  This is like saying that Animal Farm is not a critique on socialism because it’s about something else.

Neeson’s character employs capital to put on this show.  When the performer is no longer bringing in money, Neeson’s invests in a chicken to make money.  He then gets rid of the performer.  I think it’s very reasonable to consider the message and how it applies to life.  It’s not a story about the possibility of being murdered if you serve no purpose to people.  It’s an exaggeration to show the cold decision making that comes with economic rationalizations when you take humanity out of the equation.  If anyone is going to make a critique of capitalism, it’s using this argument.  The discussion is definitely warranted here.  

Again, I’m one of the first to get annoyed when I hear the griping about how evil capitalism is.  The story isn’t saying that.  But it surely left an impression on me watching this.

Eventually the talent realizes how the manager had value, returns to him and they make up and go on to a long and successful career together.

 The Coens twist that trope by taking away the artists's ability to leave but leaving him with all the animosity that comes with thinking that someone is leeching off of your talents. He sees the impresario eating, drinking and whoring with what he sees as the money he is earning. Eventually he accuses the impresario of being a parasite, likely the night the impresario tried to buy him a whore, and starts the downfall of their relationship. The impresario is now in a situation where a quadruple amputee (whose ass he has literally been wiping while still going above and beyond by trying to keep him happy with liquor and singing and even a whore) is telling him that he doesnt do enough to earn his part of the earnings.

echl28y,"Haha I saw it as when they began, the impresario had really tried to be the artists friend the best way he knew how. He would take care of him and share drinks and sing and laugh, but the pretentiousness of the artist wouldn't allow him to enjoy such base pleasures. The artist grew more and more resentful as he watched the impresario waste what he thought of as *his* money and it reached a tipping point the night the impresario tried to buy the artist a whore. The artist lashed out at the impresario and damaged the relationship to the point where they would both rather the artist be kept with the luggage than ride in a spot where there was a chance of conversation. The Impresario went on for likely years, drinking and whoring on the money they made and started to cut back on any comforts for the artist. You can tell how long it's been going by the montage of performances and how the Artist has gained the ability to completely disassociate when he's left in the room while the impresario does his business. It also goes on so long that buying a magic counting chicken barely puts a dent in all the money the impresario had been saving by cutting costs on the artists comforts. In the end, after the impresario kills the artist,  you can see a look that says ""if that idiot had just been cool I'd have kept him around and we could both be on easy street with this magic chicken.""",9x1g48

> The song grew faint and fainter, and through the silence crept back the spirit of the place. The stream once more drowsed and whispered; the hum of the mountain bees rose sleepily. Down through the perfume-weighted air fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods. The butterflies drifted in and out among the trees and all over blazed the quite sunshine. Only remained the hoof-marks in the meadow and the torn hillside to mark the boisterous trail of life that had broken the peace of the place and passed on. 

I don't think you are totally wrong- the men being there did disturb 'the peace of the place', but it was by no means a permanent thing. ""Nature"" has been here long before humanity and will be here long after we are gone.

I think it's more about the myth of 'The American Dream'. If you work hard enough and for long enough it is possible to 'strike it rich' in America- but at what cost?

Everyone is varied on many different levels, talking about what love means to one person can mean something completely different to another. Eye of the beholder stuff.

I still am not on board with the folks not being dead... I'll watch again.  ...but I'm pretty sure, unless I missed something, the woman knows she's going to meet up with her dead husband.  Also, if you pause and read the first page of the book before the story begins, the way the trapper just appears on the coach is telling of his death.  When he wakes up and says, you did not wake me for I was not asleep... he wasn't wrong.

These folks are like on the river of Styx.  I don't know in Greek who pilots the boat, but that's more the coachman character type.  It's maybe death... but I thought a reaper is just thought to be death... so not really...  The coachman not stopping is also like time...?  ...but time doesn't really have a place in the afterlife.

I don't know.  I love talking about it though.  Favorite movie this year.  I agree with your praises of it.

You didn't really mention it and maybe you may have missed it, but I think the man on the roof is still supposed to be you, the viewer.  The way the reaper talks about stories and how people put themselves in them, its you but not really you.  The guy is carried to the end... of the story. The silent observer.  We were in that carriage as much as all the other characters... and it's pointed out that way by the reaper.  We are of very high value and they make a joke about propping it up in a chair.

eageg95,"I think the title, as well as the title segment, are there to deliver a main theme of exploring life. Buster Scruggs the character represents a good man who leads a moral life, lends kindness and song to those who will take it, and defends himself against those who would oppress him. Buster Scruggs is an ideal life, not inherently good or bad, but just a man going through life trying to keep what is his and do good if he can. He doesnt even denounce his killer, but harmonizes with him in heaven. The man in black can be seen as the Yin to Scruggs' Yang, he is the opposite of him but leads his life much like buster, just from the opposite side of the tracks. So the Ballad of Buster Scruggs is the tale of all of us (or at least the tale of Americans). The subsequent stories dont feature the literal character of Buster Scruggs, but they embody different thesis on how people try to live the best life they can in the circumstances they've made for themselves.

 Two men carry his body away, which we notice how his soul ascends to heaven. Proving that this man was destined to end up in heaven. He did things respectfully and joyfully until you wronged him.

1-We’re lead to believe that Buster is an unbeatable gun-slinger in the west, until another singing gunman comes along and beats him.

2-The bank robber survived the hangman’s noose to live another day, another chance at life given to him, until the hangman’s noose finds him again for a crime he didn’t commit.

3-The actor and the promoter have a symbiotic relationship where one’s talents enable them both to live, until the promoter finds a better meal ticket.

5-A man and a woman forge an unlikely bond on the trail, seeming to forge a happiness and a potential for a future life neither of them saw coming, until the woman unnecessarily takes her life in a move intended to subvert others’ powers over her life/death.

6-All of the characters recount the facets of their lives, until it dawns on them that they’re already dead.


It only stands to reason that, if it’s always a main character who dies, and the death of a main character is usually a major subversion of where we think the story is headed, then All Gold Canyon seems to be lacking the central and unifying theme of the film unless you accept the notion that nature is a character. As one of the main characters, nature seems to return back to normal once man’s invasiveness and greed leaves with him,

(But we the audience need to fill in the gap)

Until man comes back to claim the All Gold Canyon once more.

ec190e3,"I'm surprised nobody's talking about what *was* said.
The Coen brothers are meticulous. Every word in that story is huge, especially with how few conversational words there are.
In the beginning, Neeson explains that he found the lad in England ""already missing the limbs, I assure you""
 ...
Which, why would that be necessary to put in? Why would we think otherwise?

Later, Neeson is drunk and oddly blissfully singing about the ""beautiful"" hanging of a woman.

The fact they don't speak is also a huge indicator. That, and the performer's facial expression of fear towards Neeson. If Neeson did find the lad and is caring for him, the relationship would be one of compassion and gratitude.

The final piece is when Neeson is asked if the performer has ever had sex. Neeson's response is a cold ""once"".

Leading us to conclude that the woman was Neeson's wife, and that she was cheating with the young man.
In England at that time, bawds and harlots were hung, and other criminals were sent to America.
So we can assume she was hung there. I'm just not sure if Neeson chopped off the lads limbs *there* and was sent to the states as a criminal or if he fled or what.",9x1g48

Yes, he insulted the person that insulted him, but the choice to escalate to violence was the outlaw's. 

Just because he doesn't drink whiskey after gunning down the outlaws has no bearing on his intentions.  He went in there for a card game. 

Why should he be forced to play another man's hand of cards when he sits at a table?  Again, aces & eights is the Dead Man's hand. As such people were wary of playing it.

eb26km7,"I still can't unsee how the gold miner story isn't a happy ending. I think you're stretching out the theme of death to this story just because the other stories have it. If the gold miner story was shown without the other stories in context (say it was shown as a short film by itself) then you wouldn't be making those statements that this is about the ""death of nature""",9x1g48
eb5kg68,"I get your point about death being the theme throughout. But honestly, and I don't mean to complain: in analyzing these things I feel like this gets a little, ""High School Literature Class."" I remember every single thing we read that year, somehow every book was about ""society."" Golly.

So what I mean to bring that up for is that in watching this film, and others, we get a bit like that. ""Well clearly the author is protesting something, they're making a commentary."" Sometimes in film, the creator makes something that they just like. Look up this video Stanley Kubrick being interviewed by an asian reporter about 2001: Kubrick actually explains the ending. ""Yeah so basically he gets put in an alien zoo, and it looks like a techy french apartment like how we put animals in pretty good, but not perfect enclosures. He lives out his life then goes back to earth as a higher level being. That's what I was focused on communicating there.""

Quentin Tarantino and Kubrick are similar in that, despite all the hype, what they focus on making when they make a film is a film they like. Kubrick was meticulous, but when you ask him about why he says it's because you have a filming schedule and he doesn't like reshoots.

All that to say, we look too hard and argue too much over this minutia that distracts from the real purpose of the creator. Sometimes it's to just make a film he/she enjoys. Sometimes it's to say something. If you want an example of a director hellbent on saying something implicitly, look at Darren Aronofsky. Every film me makes it's like he's sitting next to you, elbowing you and saying, ""Do ya get it?"" And it's like yeah we get it. But nobody really talks about his films. Meanwhile in organically creating a film that a talented mind enjoys, it produces endless discussion and enjoyment. 

All that to say, the general theme was death in this whole anthology. But if you're watching so much death and depression, is wise to break it up with a cheerful tale that keeps you optimistic for the other episodes. Also, I think another purpose of this film is to recapture some of the mystique and mystery of old cowboy books. My grandmother sure had a lot of them, and this film did a lot to reawaken my boyish, if morbid fascination with the legend of the west. ",9x1g48

ea4o402,"At least in real life, the chickens couldn't actually do any kind of math. Their handlers just had different ways of getting them to select the right numbers. I think the chickens did have some degree of training, but unless they explained the system, he wouldn't be able to make much use of it. And Liam Neeson's character didn't strike me as very bright, so I kind of doubt he'd have much luck figuring out how to work with the chicken on his own. I also suspect the chicken handlers might prefer to not fully explain how the act works, so they don't create a genuine competitor to their act.

Really though, it doesn't make much difference to the story whether or not he could pull off the chicken act. The cruel irony of the thing is that he was partnered with a bright, talented person, but didn't see him as anything more than a sort of trained beast. A smaller irony is that the orator essentially never talks outside of his speech, again reinforcing that he's not seen as much more than a trained beast by his handler. And in the end, once he stopped being a good meal ticket, he was literally tossed aside and replaced with a trained chicken.

I more dismissed it as just a drunk tune he knew that conveyed how carelessly he was spending money on merriment. The kind of catatonic look that came over the artist I felt showed his way of just going into this haze that helped him shut out the rage he felt at the impresario for spending what he perceived as his hard earned money that the impresario was leeching off him.

The way the impresario almost looks like he regrets killing the artist at the end also makes me believe that he really wished that the artist could have just been less pretentious and just enjoyed the simple comforts in life. It made me think he actually would have been happy to keep the artist around and provide for him if he had been just more of a friend and drinking buddy.",9x1g48

But there is also a scene where Neeson is supporting the performer whist he's having a piss and he's deliberately looking away to respect the modesty of the performer (~38 mins). 

So he might still have a penis and should be able to have sex providing his partner does all the work.
