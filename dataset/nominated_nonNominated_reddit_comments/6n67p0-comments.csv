dk81nrx,"This movie really touched me. My girlfriend and I saw it because she's white, I'm Pakastani, we thought it was a funny coincidence. I knew what it was going to be like heading into the theater. It was extremely funny and I was probably laughing the hardest, but then there were other points where a part of me asked myself if my parents could do the same they did to Kumail, and to be honest, I don't know. Whenever my girlfriend asks if something like that would happen to us, I have no idea, and I don't think I'm as brave as Kumail to find out. 

All in all, I loved the movie. I thought it was incredibly genuine with really good comedic timing. ",6n67p0

dk7ad7z,"My favorite movie this year. Ended up seeing it twice in a week and itching to go again. Thought it really balanced the humor into a pretty sad story. I was really impressed with how they showed how much he grew while she was in a coma, and how he thought the relationship grew, but with it obviously being one-sided because coma.  As an Indian guy, it was great to see a lot of the culture brought forward in a humorous way. Anupam Kher was one of my favorite actors growing up and it was great to see him in this role. 

Looking forward to how it does with a wide release. ",6n67p0
dk7do1x,"Something I really liked about this movie was that they kept the typical Apatow style improv lines (""You look like *punchline*"") with the stand up characters, who it would make sense to roast each other with jokes they come up with off the top of their head. It was a good move to keep the rest of the movie tightly scripted, unlike most Judd Apatow movies that tend to be 40 minutes too long with those type of lines.",6n67p0

dk72nkq,Having in-laws I loved the the relationship between Kumail and Ray Romano,6n67p0
dk77id8,"Changing the game for Rom/Coms. Writing, performances, and just everything was great.",6n67p0
dk77kpw,"I'm a big fan of romantic films, and am so glad that one so honest and unique is getting the amount of groundswell that it is. Even with the storytelling embellishments, you can absolutely feel how much the real Kumail cares about Emily through his character's little quirks whenever he talks to her. Normally I'm not the biggest fan of movies that don't really use the visual medium in any unique way - one reason why Punch Drunk Love is one of my favorite romance films - but The Big Sick more than makes up for it with just how fucking incredible it is in every other way.

Also, I had no idea that Ray Romano had charm. I've always regarded him as a joke actor that everybody has a bad impression of, but damn did he deliver. Terry was way more complex than any ""dolt"" character normally is.",6n67p0
dka82wf,"Great movie, so many interesting little details which is unusual in these types of movies. Like for example the scene where Emily's parents invited Kumail to her party after she woke up from the coma. It almost seemed like some kind of parallel to the whole arranged marriage thing, like the tables had turned for Kumail and now he was the one with more support from Emily's parents than her herself.",6n67p0
dk8ip74,"I'll tell you right now, this is not the movie to watch if you're having an emotionally unstable day.

dk72e1u,"If I had to use one word to describe this movie, it would be ""lovely."" There's just this magnetic charm throughout the characters and script. Fantastic performances from the 4 leads, gut-bustingly funny, and authentically sweet. Just lovely all around. My 2nd favorite of the year so far.",6n67p0
dk8g133,That 9/11 joke made me laugh out loud at the movies. No one else seemed to find it that funny. ,6n67p0
dk75nkc,Ray Romano in the hospital cafeteria may have been the funniest moment of the year. I had trouble breathing for 5 minutes ,6n67p0
dk743tg,"I loved that they didn't get back together right away. They played it perfectly. 

Kumail's comedic timing and chemistry with....everyone was great. Although I didn't fully buy the 'she could die' scene at the hospital that I think was supposed to be the big emotional climax of the movie.

I hoped that Kumail's family would turn it around in the end, but it makes sense that they didn't and you gotta respect that. Looking back, it would probably have made the movie a lot worse if it all worked out perfectly. 

Biggest regret was watching the trailers. I wish I heard some of those punch lines for the first time while watching the movie. Ex: Ray Romano's ""love"" line and Zoe's ""heckling"" bit. Glad they saved the best for a surprise though (Hospital Cafeteria scene). Won't ruin it for people that haven't seen it cause it's the loudest I've laughed at a movie, ever I think.

Also, A++++ for Bo Burnham. Loved it.

Solid 8/10, maybe 8.5 after a re-watch. ",6n67p0
dk8ncqo,"As a brown muslim dude with a white girlfriend , kumails journey was identical to mine. This movie resonated with me a lot , and along with Aziz Ansaris masters of none, im glad these type of stories are being shared. Being well made and hillarious is just a plus for me",6n67p0

dk740nw,"Having followed Kumail and Emily for a few years now it's so nice to see them blowing up and achieving so much success and acclaim with this little movie. I remember hearing Kumail and Emily tell the story on separate appearances on You Made It Weird podcast before the movie was even a thing, and the emotion when they were telling it. It's amazing that they've managed to pull this movie together out of that experience. ",6n67p0
dk82i2z,"Fantastic movie - and I found it really refreshing how unlike most romantic comedies it did not stick by some rigid formula but the humor arose organically out of the situations without minimizing the seriousness of what as going on.

And gotta put in a special mention of Holly Hunter - while everyone was good she gave a real master class in making the most of a secondary part.",6n67p0
dklempc,"I wish this movie was promoted more. People lined up to see just OK movies, but empty seats for The Big Sick. Such a shame ",6n67p0
dk79tfq,"It takes a lot to get me to laugh out loud, but there were multiple times that I just couldn't help it. Kumail was fantastic as the lead, and I hope this movie helps get him more roles! He's great! 


My favorite thing about the movie though, was how real it felt. Kumail's relationship with his parents was eye opening, while being quite interesting to learn about. Really, all the relationships in this were great. Loved seeing Kumail interact with Emily's parents, his friends, and just everyone. Definitely will be showing this one off to friends when it releases! ",6n67p0
dk728mb,"What I really loved about this film is the way it's about how real relationships don't have that rom com trope of a misunderstanding that when resolved immediately fixes everything. When Emily wakes up she's not like ""Oh my god, Kumail thanks"", she is understandably angry and confused. It recognizes they didn't have the same experience. Similarly Kumail's family clearly shows they still love him at the end but it's going to take time before he's accepted again. And as we see with Beth and Terry, Terry did something horrible but forgiveness can come eventually. I like that the film was so much about that, the way we fight but also the way we mend relationships. It's something not enough films touch on.",6n67p0
dk76k5h,"""We lost 9 of our best men""

Hardest I've laughed in a long long time. This movie was so charming and hilarious. Favorite film of the year so far out of the 30 or so I've seen. 

Also, ""I've got levels. This elevator goes all the way fucking down"". Just hilarious through and through. ",6n67p0
dk7sxbu,"I think this movie has been one of the funniest, real, and heartfelt romantic comedy in years. I would recommend anyone who is able to go see this movie to do so. ",6n67p0
dk7nmu7,"This is easily in my top 3 of the year. I know it's apples to oranges, but I think it tops Get Out for the top spot, thus far, but I want to take some time to process it before knowing for sure. Kumail's family plot line was so powerful. It almost carried more weight than the romantic story that the film revolved around. His dad and brother were fantastic in their roles. 

Also, can we get some love for Holly Hunter?! She flat out KILLED it in her role. Every aspect of the film was well-done but I really really enjoyed her role way more than I thought I would. ",6n67p0
dlyr0qy,"I liked it. I didn't know a fucking thing about it at all when I went to the cinema, so I was glad it turned out to be a good movie. 


Definitely a fan of the abnormal plot structure too. Nothing Hollywood about it, just a simple story made funny.",6n67p0
dkqlgcn,So what was the significance of Kumail's dad remembering what movie he went to on the first date?,6n67p0
dkl6osh,"I was lucky enough to attend the premiere of this movie, so I'm obviously biased, but it does live up to the hype. After hearing Kumail's story and hearing Judd picked it up in 2012, I've been waiting for this film. 

Touching, truthful, honest, hilarious-- every trigger word reviewers use for this flick fit. A perfect date night for anyone and perfect comedy for anyone who likes to laugh. Another Apatow great.

Getting to speak with Kumail and Emily was a pleasure and this movie is hardly a testament to their fantastic relationship. Really awesome folks that made one helluva movie.",6n67p0
dkcqy9i,"Anyone else find some of the editing really bad? I was frequently distracted by dialogue that was out of sync with characters' jaw movements in over-the-shoulder shots.

Overall though, great movie.",6n67p0
dk77iux,"Saw it last night, here are some bullet points from my unfinished review:    
      
* One of the best Rom-Coms in years, while also being an excellent story about the challenges growing up as a Muslim immigrant in America.     

* Holly Hunter and Ray Romano stole the spotlight every time they were on screen. Hunter’s fierce, fiery, blunt, and protective Southern mother contrasts so well with Ray’s docile and submissive - yet loving and forgiving - father-figure.      

* Every role in this movie was perfectly cast, which amplifies the authenticity of the true story being portrayed. From the family on both side, to the stand-up comedians, to the random bit players and extras. Loved seeing some of my favorite comedians (Bo Burnham, Kurt Braunohler, Aidy Bryant, David Alan Greer, etc.).     

* Fantastic script, with so many great singular jokes, tough conversations, and touching moments. If you're familiar with Kumail and Emily you can really feel them come through in the writing. The 9/11 joke is one of the best jokes this year (if not, the past few years).   
      
**SPOILERS**     
      
[ - The movie is almost two romantic comedies in one. We first get Kumail and Emily, their meet/cute, their months of dating, and their break-up. Then when she gets sick, we get to repeat the whole thing with Kumail and her parents. Their meet/cute is at the hospital, and start from a place of disagreement, then he slowly grows on them and wins them over, then they really get along and like each other. Then Emily wakes up, and both relationships are thrown into turmoil.](#spoiler)      

[ - I really appreciated the fact that Emily was not immediately ready to be in love with Kumail right after she wakes up. She’s still mad at him and tells him that right off the bat. It takes her a very long time to realize that she still loved him, and almost misses her chance as he moves away as life continued. Love is shown to be messy and that people fall in love at different times and things aren’t perfect](#spoiler)  

[ - I love while the movie digs into the various aspects of arranged marriage, and how difficult that could be for a younger person in America, it still doesn’t villainize his family or Islam.](#spoiler)",6n67p0
dk858vg,"There's a handful of movies I've seen that were not only memorable because they were excellent, but because of the profound impact they had on the people I saw them with. I remember taking a couple of friends of mine to see The Wrestler and one friend tearing up at the end because the way Randy tried to be a better Father reminded her of her own absentee Father.   
Or in the case in this movie, I went with a Muslim friend who explained after the movie what it was like to take a ""final"" picture of his family because his brother was leaving to become a minister for another religion.   
I'm still not sure whether seeing these movies for those people was cathartic or a good experience or not, but it reminds me that sometimes movies can touch on real lives and genuine pain that open up people and make them unintentionally vulnerable. And that sometimes the people you see a movie *with* can open up your eyes to a world you haven't experienced, beyond the film itself.",6n67p0
dkovn1x,"I freaking loved this movie. Get Out is my #1 movie of the year, this is my #2. I just really enjoyed it and it was a feel good, original film. Only grip is I wish they developed Emily a tad, just a tad, more. I wish we got into her divorce more, it would help us feel more badly for her when she leaves him, and when she gets sick. And makes Kumail's change that much more impressive. But Im being nit picky, it was an awesome movie. Met my high expectations. ",6n67p0
dmt136g,Loved loved loved this movie!!  Kumail and Emily are so good together.  The fact that this is a true love story makes the movie so intiguing.  They are both great writers and so very talented.  Would even love to see a weekly sitcom about their life and love story.  Kumail is hilarious and just love him.  Love is love is love and in the words of the Beatles love is all you need.  The love of my life was from Lebanon.  He came to the States for college which is where we met.  Ironically I had visited Lebanon with my family while growing up and the hotel that we stayed at was 2 blocks from his house.  We met 8 years later in college and dated six years before life and jobs took us our separate ways.  I believe in fate and love and that people will fall in love and meet one another even if on the other side of the world and from two different cultures if they are meant to meet and be together.  Love is love and what makes the world go round!  Love heals all and love is truly all we need!  Thank you Kamail and Emily for sharing your beautiful real life story of love and friendship!  Wishing you a lifetime of love health happiness and laughter!  ,6n67p0
dk745r0,"Kumail and Emily were guests on the Nerdist podcast a few weeks ago promoting the movie. They're a lot of fun together with host Chris Hardwick, who's a long time friend of theirs.  Here's the link:  http://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-kumail-nanjiani-and-emily-v-gordon/",6n67p0
dkzxp4o,"I thought it balanced the drama and the comedy really well. It was a tad bit too long I think, but that's about the only thing I can nitpick from it really. Would love to know how much of this true and what things were made for the movie though!",6n67p0
dk7a8kk,"Got back a couple hours ago.  I'm an easy cry and a somewhat easy laugh, but I honestly can't think of a film that has made me chuckle through tears as consistently as the 3rd act of this.  I could say I'm biased as I've been a huge fan of Kumail & Emily for a shameful amount of time, but my friend who has no idea who they are was also constantly wiping tears and laughing through the third act.  Afterwards, we both went to the bathroom and I waited for like fifteen minutes, wondering what the fuck was going on.  Turns out, she just went to wipe her eyes and face and redo her makeup and noped outside because she didn't want to be seen after sorta crying for a half hour.

One of my favorites of the year.  We were the only ones in the the theater at a 9:20 showing in a mid-sized city.  I really hope that's not indicative of the weekend BO because I want this thing to succeed so much.",6n67p0
dk73enm,Great movie. My only exposer to him before this was through Silicon Valley and once I got home I decided to try to find some of his stand up on YouTube. I was specifically looking for the meltdown scene but couldn't find it so I assume that part is fake or wasn't recorded.  I did discover however the standup he did in the movie was based off his old routines. Even some of the discussions like the time nerd thing was based off his old standup. If your interested you should look it up. ,6n67p0
dlddbrj,"This is one of the best movies of 2017 so far. It's great to see a comedy with incredibly likable characters and emotional resonance. Nanjiani is a star in Silicon Valley and he's only cemented it here. The only minor flaw I have is that it runs slightly too long, but its story hooked me so much that it didn't bother me. My full review: https://iwandm.wordpress.com/2017/08/09/the-big-sick-review/",6n67p0
dk7j827,"Holy shit this movie fucking FLOORED me. Incredible emotions all around and an excellent story. On top of it all, it was one of the funniest movies of the year.",6n67p0
dkhqaku,"I don't think this lived up to the hype at all. I liked it, but besides the interracial dating element, I don't think there was anything else that really set it apart from the typical romantic comedy. I didn't even find it that funny.

I didn't find their relationship convincing. I think it went too fast.The best insight we get into their relationship is the voicemails that Kumail listens to toward the end, but before that, what exactly do we see from them? They bang a few times, they have the one funny/realistic scene where she has to shit in his house, and then all of a sudden she finds the photos, they fight, and then she falls sick. I didn't find Emily particularly likable and wasn't really invested in her, or them as a couple.

I feel like the movie hit all the obligatory plot points but with no real consequences. Kumail's parents confront him, he tells them that he doesn't pray (which is a great scene), he shows up at the dinner, and then they come to visit him before he leaves for NYC. Same with Emily--she rebuffs him when she finally awakens, then he shows up to her party, then she comes to his show, and then they reunite again in New York. All of these scenes were well-handled, but they were exactly what I expected and there was no real feeling of consequence because it was so familiar and formulaic.

With that said, it was still solid. Ray Romano and Holly Hunter were great, and their scenes with Kumail were the most poignant. I loved the scene where Terry confesses to cheating and when Kumail and Beth view Emily's old Facebook photos. There were a lot of very rich scenes but the story itself seemed uninspired. The scenes work individually but fail to come together in a meaningful way. Just because the film is about illness and race does not mean its audience is automatically going to care about its characters, and I feel like it tried to coast by on this. I sympathized with Kumail's dreams and desire to date whoever he wanted, but I was indifferent about Emily. If you're going to make a film in which one of the main characters is unconscious for the whole second act, she better be pretty damn special, and she wasn't. 

Also, a minor note, I don't like the title at all. It just seems lazy. Decent flick but definitely nowhere as good as what the critics say.",6n67p0
dk8w0qw,Honestly this movie is carried by the marriage story between Holly Hunter and Ray Romano. That was some next level stuff. Its hardly the romance that drives it.,6n67p0
dk76zz7,Really great movie. I feel like I haven't seen a movie like this in forever that covers some many different emotional feelings. I laughed and I cried. Ray Romano was awesome. ,6n67p0

drozw91,"I know this movie has been out forever, I just want to say that I loved it! So many levels of emotions",6n67p0
dk7lurd,"I saw it last week, and was absolutely blown away. It reminded me of early Judd Apatow movies like Knocked Up and the 40-Year Old Virgin in that it was a great mix of hilarious comedy and genuinely heartfelt mediation on love and relationships. 

The acting all-around was fantastic. I've seen Kumail in Silicon Valley and love his standup, but I honestly had no idea he had that much range until this movie. Holly Hunter, Ray Ramano, and Zoe Kazan (who isn't in as much of the movie since, you know, coma) are all great too. 

Hope this movie picks up some awards in the winter. It certainly deserves them. It just topped ""Get Out"" as my personal favorite of the year. ",6n67p0

dkovuxy,"I went to this movie at the request of my gf. I watched the trailer, thought it looked ok, but wasn't excited to see it. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was come end credits. I think Ray Romano and Holly Hunter's characters were my favorite, but Kumail Nanjiani and Zoe Kazan were both really good. They did a good job telling their story and as a result, I will continue recommending it to friends with this disclaimer: it's pretty long (2 hours).",6n67p0
dqgvxo4,"Just saw the movie this weekend and i loved it. I'm pakistani, albeit not Muslim, but i experienced the same sort of marriage process. What i really liked about the film is that it portrayed modern arranged marriage how it really is (not the western view of it) and it didn't portray it as a bad thing. There are definitely problems sometimes (such as women's ability to choose), but in general modern arranged marriage is essentially a dating service organized by your parents. ",6n67p0
druha9u,"This movie spoke to me on so many levels, and i haven't read the comment thread yet but im sure there's bound to be many fellow indian/pakistan americans who are struggling with the same family dilemmas that Kumail is. I pretty much related to everything Kumail said to his family in this film, in fact i've asked many of the same questions to my own parents, (esp the why come to america bit); 
having to hide past girlfriends, having relationships break because of the same reasons like Kumail did in the film...the list goes on. Indulging my parents fantasies about arranged marriages or just ""marriage"" can be tough, and I really like how this film grasped the hopelessness sometimes a person can go through trying to make your parents happy while also trying to find your own happiness. 
God knows what will happen when this situation will inevitably come to a head for me in the next few years.
Fantastic film. 5/5",6n67p0

dkhlcb9,Saw the movie yesterday. It was a cute movie but i saw some issues with it. First the pacing of the film was bad. Some scenes were way too long and by the second half you wanted to get to the point. Also the movie wasn't that funny. Some chuckles but nothing thing really made me laugh out loud. Overall i would give this movie a 7/10 but not movie of the year i was told it was by critics. ,6n67p0
dklcx0b,"I liked this movie and I'm a fan of Kumail Nanjiani and Zoe Kazan, but I did feel like there were parts where the story dragged a bit (especially the third act). I know its a true story so they might have wanted to show the full thing with all it's warts, but still it did slow down some. Overall, I really loved what the movie said and showed and I had a great time! Everyone was great in this and the story felt very authentic (for obvious reasons) and cute! bravo Kumail, a solid 8/10",6n67p0
dkcp5nf,"This was a good movie, but I definitely think the reviews are way overhyping it. Solid 7 and an enjoyable evening. The comedy isn't really my style, which is why for me personally it may be more of a 6.5, but I can totally respect and understand someone with a different sense of humor rating this movie higher. 

I think the only real error I noticed was that the tone was very inconsistent. There were many sad scenes, but some of those sad scenes were played for dark or awkward jokes while others were played as genuinely sad, and I don't think there was a clear enough distinction of which it was going to be until the jokes started rolling (or didn't). But for the most part, this was a good movie, and better than most romantic comedies I've seen recently. ",6n67p0
dk7bc4c,"As an Indian-American dude, I love seeing fellow brown dudes kill it.. I really wanted to love it but I just don't see what the fuss is about. I didn't think Emily's character was developed  enough to feel strong emotion when she got sick. I didn't care for the way Pakistani women were portrayed as these undesirable, nerdy, bumbling idiots who were desperate to lock down a (at the time) struggling comedian. ",6n67p0
dk9y0jb,"As a pakistani and a former muslim of shia background (essentially kumails back ground), this was a pleasant surprise to watch. The inside jokes about shias are extra ordinary, and you'd probably not get them, or understand them if you even spot em. It was great to hear and see someone of a pakistani origin starring as a pakistani. I mean when do you get to see things like that, that often?

Here's where I think hollywood production designers took over, and fucked things up. It's likey not kumails fault, he doesn't control every aspect of the film, but the rest of the cast are head shaking, caricatured indians with huge indian accents. Not pakistani. I mean forget pakistani for a second, it was indian american actors doing what they THINK what old indian people sound like. anyway, what a disappointment there. It's like casting thick slavic accented bosnians, as americans, who eat swedish food, and have french culture... because all white people are the same right? In non kumail characters, the producers watered the shit out of pakistani culture, and in most cases eliminated it completely because either they don't know about basic facts, and don't WANT to know. kumail was probably too scared to speak up at the glaring horrendousness, or too busy to notice.

not only that, all the culture, the clothes, and shit, all indian. Who the fuck eats butter chicken in pakistan. i mean what the fuck is a butter chicken. also, and the characters speak hindi, not urdu. infact at one point, to prove to other characters, a woman says that she speak perfect urdu (supposedly in urdu). But it sounded like a toddler, if it tried to speak english. ""I GOOD SPEAK MUCHING ANGLIS.""

this is all detailed nuance though. i guess the movie is pointed toward an audience that won't notice nuance but will get the theme and gist of the story.",6n67p0
dkfu8bk,"I loved this movie. I've been a huge fan of Kumail for years now and have listened to his stand up and many podcast appearances talking about many of the things that happen in this movie.

But there are so many (small, insignificant) details that I'm curious if they actually happened or if they were just there to help the story. Like, did Emily's parents really not like him at first? Was Kumail really doing stand up sets while trying to deal with the woman he loves being in a coma? Did Emily really not want anything to do with him when she woke up? And if so, did she really follow him to NYC afterwards?

I'm always curious about movies based on true stories, especially when it's one of my favorite stand ups.

One note - I wouldn't call this a romcom, rather more a dram-romcom. Definitely a lot of drama, and a slower tone with the comedy than some of the other Apatow fare, which actually makes it more believable, and relatable. 

Definitely a solid 5/7, must-see :)",6n67p0

dkdsdem,"I'm on the fence about this movie. I'm not much of a ""movie guy"" - I barely watch a handful of movies a year, if that. What struck me about the film was how strongly the emotions of the Emily character resonated with me. I lived her side of the relationship with someone from that culture (only my ex was Indian, not Pakistani). When she confronted him about not telling his family about her and the relationship ended, it felt so real to me. It's hard to say why, but I think it's because I have the relatively unique experience of living that scene first hand.

Because of how personally I connected with the movie on that level, I'm not sure what to make of it. I think the tone was inconsistent, the funny parts weren't that funny, and the sad parts weren't that sad. I think Kumail's character (not the person, the character in the movie) was more than a bit of an asshole. 

All that said, I do think it takes a fairly fresh approach to a romantic comedy. And I think that it takes some level of talent and insight to make the audience connect with the characters - something which I can honestly say I have never done before. 

So, all in all I'd say it's a fair film that's worth a watch if you're interested in the premise. It's not a fantastic film, but it's fine. ",6n67p0

I really liked Kumail, I really liked Bo Burnham, Ray Romano was amazing.

I felt much more attachment to the male and the female lead's parents than the female lead though, which I think as a man watching a romance film from a man's perspective is not ideal.

dll2jhj,Maybe its not an integral point of the film but I didn't understand the infection that Emily suffered. What did they remove from her lung if she wasn't suffering from an infection? MRSA was mentioned at one time but that would have been associated with lots of testing and direct observation of the bacteria from samples for identification and antibiotic selection. I don't want to get bogged down in medical details but the degree of misdiagnosis seems so wild and the fact that its based on real events seems to distract from the (excellent) story.,6n67p0

- The ending felt drawn-out. The story inherently made things difficult structurally, but the ending still lumbered along. Final scene felt like a rushed, clunky way of ending the film.

- Kumail's dramatic acting didn't meet the level of his costars. His emotional scenes didn't always resonate to the degree of Kazan, Hunter, etc.

- The comedy never quite knew if it was slice-of-life/indie in tone, or something more absurdist, so the movies tone comedically felt a bit all over the map.",6n67p0

I was thoroughly disappointed. It's not that the movie wasn't endearing or funny (It was easily both), it's that it is nowhere close to the ""Amazing, profound, best movie of the year!!!!"" flick that it was sold to me as by multiple review sites and people. 

It was a rom-com, most of the jokes were chuckle worthy, but I don't think my theater ever erupted in laughter and it was at least half full.

dkcp1a7,"I'm dense so I need someone to explain something to me about the two-day rule.

When Kumail first meets Holly Hunter, she tells him that she knows everything about him because Emily told her. When she mentioned the two-day rule in particular, there was an emphasis and a bit of venom to her tone as if Kumail has been using the rule to mask some ulterior motive.

I thought the rule was just some silly thing that he tries to adhere to but isn't too upset about breaking. Was there some angle where the rule someone was related to Kumail trying to keep his life with Emily and his home life separate? If there is I'm too dumb to catch it.

Also, during the scene with Skippy and his Brah, if this were real life, would there have been a nice bouncer who would gently escort the assholes out of the club? Momma Hunter was taken outside by some men because she was about to go Honey Badger on that guy. In real comedy clubs, are there bouncers to protect the comedians from hecklers? The nature of comedy can be really incendiary. Wouldn't most clubs have people there to protect the comedians?",6n67p0

dknud2k,Here's my problem: I didn't like Emily. I actively wanted Emily to die at the end (didn't know it was based on a true story). I thought the main characters friends were funnier than the main character. I think the parents - ESPECIALLY romano - carried that movie.,6n67p0

I ended up loving Ray Romano and their relationship, which I wasn't expecting because I normally don't like Romano. I was surprised that I was most interested to see Kumail bond with Emily's parents than with Emily. 

Overall a sweet, funny, but formulaic movie.  Many of its themes are similar to what Aziz Ansari has explored in Master of None, but not quite as memorable. A nice twist on romantic comedies and it's great that after all the talk that there are no Asian romantic leads, there finally is one and in a decent movie too.

Also I loved the 9/11 joke, but the bit with Ray rambling about his tuna sandwich already had me cracking up. It reminded me of my dad.",6n67p0

There are lot of wonderful and great things in the film. There are quirky moments and nice unexpected surprises. But I felt a little outside of the film from an emotional standpoint and I didn't feel as connected as I should have been.

Terrific performances and solid writing. But for me, something was missing, just a little off, the would prevent this from being a classic.

Kumail is great but I can't see him as a leading man. He's at his best in Silicon Valley - here, he didn't quite have the emotional versatility to pull off the big scenes. But these are all little gripes because I wanted the film to be great.",6n67p0

dk9vkqv,"It’s the wonder of The Big Sick , the must-see romantic comedy of the year. Sweet-natured, funny and genuine.
That two people could overcome centuries-old cultural obstacles, the perils of modern dating and a critical illness and end up together is a great story. That those two people also managed to adapt their own great story into a great movie is a miracle.
At the centre is Kumail Nanjiani, the deft comedian who we know from HBO’s Silicon Valley. He actually uses his full, real name in the film, which he co-wrote with his wife, Emily Gordon and based on their wild courtship. Emily has ceded her part to an actor, Zoe Kazan, who continues her very persuasive campaign to be the rom-com dream girl for those who fancy themselves better than rom-coms.
One of the really wonderful and telling things about The Big Sick is how fleshed out the world is around Kumail and Emily - from Kumail’s comedy friends (Bo Burnham, Aidy Bryant and Kurt Braunohler), to his family (Anupam Kher, Zenobia Shroff, Adeel Akhtar and Shenaz Treasury) and Emily’s parents, no supporting character is made into a caricature. Even the potential wives are given distinct and memorable personalities. Their presence is mined for comedy, but the women aren’t punchlines. It’s a delicate balance that The Big Sick gets just right.",6n67p0

dk8auh9,"I wanted to like this movie. There were a few times when I chuckled a bit but I found myself bored which is a shame because I think Kumail Nanjiani is hilarious on Silicon Valley. I guess part of the reason is I'm just not into romantic comedies in general. But this seemed to be a little more drawn out than it should have been. Ray Romano and Holly Hunter were good but in my mind, they didn't save it for me. 

There was nothing in this that was laugh out loud funny in my opinion but I'm pretty sure ""romantic comedy"" just isn't my type of genre. There's not a single person here who agrees with me on this so I'd tell anyone to go see it because clearly, I have a different opinion than the rest of the country. ",6n67p0
dk8ybj2,"Loved the movie overall. Truly terrific. My favorite aspect was the messy relationship Kumail had with his parents, which while unresolved was beautifully done.

I do have a few nitpicks, though.

1) Why did everyone treat Kumail's Montreal audition as the ""worst bomb ever""? Obviously it wasn't funny, and he deserved his rejection from Montreal, but if a comedian broke down like that on stage, wouldn't the performance go viral in an (unintentionally) beneficial way? I feel like that kind of video would be shared around the world by people who sympathized with Kumail.

2) Emily was horribly unlikeable after waking up. It makes sense why she wouldn't want to get back together with Kumail, but the way she reacted to his ""bag"" at the party was so bitchy that I wished her character fell back into her coma. Kazan's performance gave off an ""ungrateful"" vibe instead of a ""conflicted"" vibe.

3) This isn't a nitpick really, but I think it would have been cute of Kumail's parents met watching ""Forrest Gump"" to parallel Ray Romano's mentioning of the film earlier. Just personal taste, though -- others might find that too screenplay-y for lack of a better term.",6n67p0

dk9vaqm,"Michael Showalter’s drama is based on the real-life romantic track of the protagonist (Kumail who plays himself) and the gori he ultimately marries. And the script (co-written by Kumail and Emily) has many laugh-out-loud moments. Their initial dates, where the couple talks of keeping it casual are fun to watch. As is the scene in which you’re introduced to Kumail’s family. The banter at Nanjianis’ suburban Chicago home with his parents Azmat (Anupam Kher) and Sharmeen (Zenobia Shroff), is delightful. Kumail who fears that he’ll be osctracised doesn’t tell his parents about his American girlfriend. Nor does he give in to Emily’s request of having dinner with her parents—Terry (Ray Romano) and Beth (Holly Hunter) who are visiting from North Carolina. This is when Emily decides to call off their relationship. But fate wills otherwise. When she lands up in hospital, Kumail who takes charge of the situation also comes to terms with how deeply he cares for her. Self-deprecatory humour keeps the mood alive through and through.As far as performances go, Ray and Holly lead the way; Anupam Kher is adept and Kumail with his mostly-comic expressions passes muster.

Why is the foreign, pakistani female being treated like a fresh off the boat joke? Her accent was mocked. Her awkward love of the xfiles was made fun of. And for what? To prop up a white female.

How can a film purport to be about compassion for other cultures and unifying races when it trashes nonwhite female immigrants to glorify a white female? The casting of heather from crazy ex girlfriend was completely racist since she's not racially accurate.

This is like that disgusting master of none tv show. Aziz talks about racial diversity and representation of nonwhites. But he keeps casting white actresses for his character.

These white worshipping propaganda machines are sick but this is what hollywood prefers. They want us nonwhites to revolve around white people. It's the same thing with new spiderman. The thugs are african americans and brown skinned latin americans, while their boss is white. The filipino best friend's weight was made as a joke when the costume became fatter when he wore it. The filipino best friend aspires to only be spiderman's tech sidekick. He lives vicariously thru white spiderman. The nonwhite females are light skinned and are enamored with white spiderman.

iq0746y,"I really hated this movie because Emily was soooooo privileged, she was totally unrelatable. There was nothing about her that made me think “yes, it makes total sense he wants to be with her” other than she embodies a much higher social status, and that’s about it. As a person she’s pretty much a spoiled turd.

I mean, she can fuck on the first date because she’s been married before and knows she can get another husband with the snap of her finger if she wanted to. She also doesn’t have to worry about stalkers, pregnancy, or heartbreak because she has loving parents who will help her through all of life’s pitfalls. Basically only rich white women can afford to have that kind of attitude.

Nobody in the film works. I don’t mean part-time gig stuff, I mean nobody has a job with actual obligations that they need to fulfill to ensure their survival. 

All this time hanging out in the hospital would be impossible if the parents were real people who had real jobs and had to take care of their homes in whatever state they live in. 

Emily is basically a child, as evidenced by how her parents can just hang out at her apartment for months. Both parents are there for her at all times, neither of them with the need to make any income, or any obligations to anything else, apparently. 

Because Emily is basically still a child, she has no needs and no demands of Kumail. If she was anywhere near an average adult person, instead of a baby woman with doting parents, she’d have bills to pay, and would probably need Kumail to help her through physical therapy. 

It wouldn’t fucking matter how much he “makes her heart sad.” She’d hate him, but would learn to live with it, and he’d learn to resent her as the grind of her need and physical therapy started to wear on him. But that’s real life, baby. It’s not magic mommy and daddy flying in and cleaning up all the hard parts of the bad shit that happens.

I’d also like to put a shout out to the mind bogglingly excellent medical care Emily got in the hospital. If that were a black woman they’d probably tell her to walk it off and send her back home. But if it’s a cute little skinny white woman then of course everyone moves heaven and earth to save her. No question about it. They even fight over what is the best treatment for her! Most people are lucky to have one person visit them in the hospital, much less have a cadre of people with them at all times for long periods of time.

There’s also the sickening way he treats all the earnest hard working Pakistani women that his mother sets him up with. They want something from him - a relationship and marriage, and therefore he can have disdain for them. He’s better than all that! He doesn’t want anything! He’s a butterfly! He’s as free and irresponsible as this carefree rich white lady!

Emily can just treat him like a fuck boi at the beginning because she knows that no matter what happens she’ll have mommy and daddy to take care of her. She can be as reckless and impulsive as she wants, she’ll never be fully accountable for her actions. 

She divorced a guy because she wanted someone who would make out with her at a restaurant? What a fucking stupid reason to break up with someone. I know many great women who waited decades to be able to get married. To see someone held up as so desirable, who gets everything in life without any effort or merit of her own is upsetting. 

But yeah, like I said, when you’re that skinny, white, and privileged, you probably know that men are lining up outside your door to be with you. Even if you have a dumb haircut and wear overalls.",6n67p0

What I believe we're shown in the movie is these women trying to be matched to Kumail. Thus, it's not surprising that they are shown to perhaps not be very desirable.

Basically a lot of it was true: Kumail was leading his parents on, he and Emily were in rocky place, and he did realize how much she meant to him while she was in a medically induced coma. Sounds like most of the fake stuff came in the aftermath. In real life Kumail's family was angry but doesn't sound like they ever went full on we are never speaking.

dk73x3f,"I'm a big fan of Kumail and Emily and have listened to a good few podcast appearances from years back, as far as I remember the main premise is entirely true. Emily fell into a coma when they were in an early but uncertain part of their relationship, while she was in the coma he got to know their parents in an awkward way which ultimately meant they got close. And when Emily woke up (I remember him saying on one of the podcasts I think) he knew he wanted to marry her. 

The only differences would be obviously specific dialogue and the looks of the parents etc, and maybe the awkwardness with Kumail and the parents exaggerated slightly. Also Kumail's age, this was a good few years ago it actually happened. 

Emily just isn't an actress whereas Kumail had been acting for some time, and this is the first time she's written a movie too so I'm guessing she just wanted to play as much of a role on the writing end as she could.

Later in the movie she even admits that she watched 3 episodes for him in order to feign interest but she thought they sucked. How you got ""her love of the x-files was mocked"" out of that I will never know. And if you understood the plot of the movie you would know her character was not there as a racial punching bag, she (and the other girls) were there to show the audience how uncomfortable Kumail was with the arranged marriage and that it was all just a dog and pony show to him and he was only cooperating to appease his mother.

The Meltdown got a Comedy Central show for 3 seasons and it's a great watch if you're into stand up. The show was performed in the back of a comic book store so that should give you an idea of what it's like.

Comedy movies that use this style well are Bruno and Borat (both starring SBC), which I really enjoyed. One of my favorite comedy shows is Summer Heights High (starring Australian comedian Chris Lilley), which also uses this type of humor. His other series are similar, but I think Summer Heights High is his best one. I also enjoy full-blown farces like Airplane or Monty Python.  

I think in the end, though, people have different tastes in comedy so that's why I tend to be cautious of giving comedy movies any definitive rating since it can be so subjective. ",6n67p0
dk96yd7,"Kumail's suitors (suitesses?) were very attractive, and seemed like nice people too. However they definitely are painted as desperate and it is definitely because of their family structure.

As the one girl described herself as the bad apple or whatever at the bottom of the bag - I think they probably all feel that way.

I think it did a fair job of showing that they weren't entirely Gung ho about it either.

Arranged marriage to females who aren't white.

U watched the chris rock hosted oscars? The night's theme was hollywood's racism, yet what did Sasha Baron Cohen do? He made fun of chinese male genitalia, while olivia wilde laughed with him when they presented an award. That same olivia wilde calls President Trump a racist. Liberal, hateful hollywood loves to lecture us on everything, yet they're hateful and racist. Chris rock said there are more significant issues than hollywood's racism. The  liberal, hollywood crowd clapped enthusiastically. Rock gave a fake oscar to an african american and told him to give a speech. He said racial diversity doesn't mean only african americans, but other races as well like asians, etc, and the liberal, hollywood crowd gave weak claps. They hate us nonwhites.

Hateful hollywood lecture us about homophobia, yet they voted for hillary, who received donations from UAE and brunei, regimes which murder nonwhite lgbts. It's fine with hollywood that homophobic, racist hillary took donations from those regimes since they don't murder white lgbts.

But I don't think saying 50/50 and The Big Sick are variations of a similar story. Yes, both are in the same genre, somewhat based in true events, and if someone liked one, I might also suggest the other. But 50/50 deals with one man's struggle through cancer and feeling alone in that, while Big Sick deals more with choosing between success and love, while also having to worry about strict religious and family issues.

Racebending characters isn't fighting racism, it's erasure.

2.Youre intellectually blind since u prioritize you feeling comfortable when us nonwhites speak against racism. We're not going to phrase things to make u feel better. Stop making this battle about respectability politics and how u feel when it should be about us nonwhites. If u don't feel comfortable, then don't join the discussion.",6n67p0

U really think we need another Spiderman and that the nonwhite Spiderman getting his own film would be oppression to whites?

Yes, race bending nonwhite characters like scarlet witch, quicksilver, the ancient one, the African American captain America, asian wasp and nonwhite captain marvel to white characters is erasure. There are a lot of white characters and seldom nonwhite ones.

STOP acting like you're being oppressed when us nonwhites are fighting for representation when we're very underrepresented. ",6n67p0

You're putting words in mouth nonstop, missing the point of what I'm saying, and assuming I'm white (which for someone who claims to be fighting for minorities is iust hilarious). I wish there was some way for me to reach through your bitterness but its clear there isn't.

dkbbzj5,">Why are u against representation of underrepresented nonwhites? THAT""S SICK

I didn't say that. I'm saying existing characters shouldn't be racebended because of the audience. Also you're pretty much admitting that diversity causes problems like this. You believe that audiences are so vain and fragile that they require people of their race up on the screen, even if it means white erasure. We were generous enough to change our immigration laws and this is the thanks we get.",6n67p0

YOURE SICK. Go back to your kkk enclave. Racism from whites and their hatred to us nonwhites causes problems. 

>vain and fragile

White people who are against any small representation of nonwhites are vain and fragile.

It's true. Japan doesn't have to deal with this shit.

You're still missing the point. Racebending is extremely disrespectful.
