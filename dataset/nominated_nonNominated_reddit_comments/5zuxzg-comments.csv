Making the prince older when he got cursed makes a whole lot more sense than cursing a child.

Having the enchantress basically heal and change the beast back at the end made more sense than him magically recovering from his injuries in the original. 

I'm also confused as to what the openly gay scene people freaked out about was.

Was it during Gaston's song when LeFou had him hug him from behind? The dance at the end? If Disney hadn't said something, I wouldn't have had a second thought since LeFou always came across as gay to me.

In the animated version he's this silly, bumbling, almost mad-scientist character, to the point where you can almost sympathize with Gaston for wanting him committed.

df1geel,"Just saw it and would say it was a positive movie experience. I knew if it was anything like the original it would be, at the very least an ok movie. And while it did stay true to the original it also added some new interesting moments that gave the audience more of an understanding with some of the movie's characters. The new added material was all great IMO and the only flaws lied within the recreation of some source material. 

Here are some thoughts I wrote down shortly after seeing it.

Could have picked a better belle but Emma has star power and that's what sells. I like how her father was a little less quirky than in the original and the explanation of belles mothers death added a layer of emotion we haven't seen from our favorite Disney princess. Aside from giving belle(whose first love is reading) a ""spectacular"" library, beast also was the reason she finally understood why her father left Paris. Due to beast opening up that enchanted book, it provided the audience another reason Belle continued opening her heart to beast. Also the flower pin she got from where her mom died was a plot device used later in the movie to open the asylum carriage.. small details like this can often be the difference between good and bad movies. I like how they included the organ and he had a happy ending unlike in the Christmas movie haha. I thought Gaston did an excellent job and other then Lefeu's spelling of ""GASTON"" (which felt awkward and out of place) Gastons song was second only to Be our guest. Ewan hit all the right notes in what to me was the most visually spectacular scene in the movie. Maybe the only time in the entire movie where I didn't question whether it was real or not because frankly I didn't care, I felt like I was one of the guests. So overall beauty and the beast was an above average remake of a timeless Disney classic. It had a couple scenes that were really amazing and just a few heads scratchers. Recasting unforgettable characters is tough and Disney did a great job providing us a handful of performances that were just as good as the original.",5zuxzg

That was one of the biggest/most jarring plot hole in the original for me. He was a prince, for God's sake, he must had gotten an education in the modern languages, but in the original he didn't even know how to read?! 

They made a huge deal about how reading is a way to escape reality, the beast's reality is very grim, so it only makes sense he reads a lot (even stuff he doesn't like) to escape his own pain.",5zuxzg

df4be4s,"just realised how ridiculous the mobs are. they literally talked about how the beast would kill their children, etc when they just found out that he existed a minute before, and they already wanted to kill him without seeing if he's good or bad.  

i love the extensions added on top of the original. Beast being well versed in literature and a bookworm himself. it makes more sense for Belle to fall in love with him than just because he saved him. in regard to book too, shoutout to the fact that village's library was only a row of few books (instead of shelves of books in original movie), really show how illiterate the village people were.  

the reason why Beast is a jerk was revealed with a backstory. this gives him an extra dimension and make his character development to be more believable (good inside, but brought up badly). shoutout also to staffs who blamed themselves for not doing anything, thus their sense of duty and loyalty to Beast.  

Maurice and Belle's relationship is very sweet. this really shows how much understanding they both have of each other. also made sense why Maurice emphasized ""small village is safe"" because he wanted to avoid the plague.  

Le Fou character development is also interesting, he's not just Gaston's lackey, he actually has moral standard of his own. he is not comfortable with some of Gaston's action, though followed it in the end.  

and i bet that the writers follow cinemasins, so many things pointed out by them are fixed in this story, making it more sense logically.

My only major complaint was adding a few new short songs instead of keeping in ""Human again,"" which is one of my favorite numbers.

dfr3xf2,"A few things I wanted to add that weren't really addressed in other comments. 

I love that Disney really added this history of France as a character almost in itself. The ridiculous costumes, the dancing, the men wearing heels and makeup in the elites, the beast having lavish parties with the commoners money, etc. it all made for a much richer environment, to add to the comments others have made to the guillotine thing that Lumiere does. They never really addressed any of that in the animated one, it's kind of up to the viewer to just accept the tale that is given to you. Also, I really love the picture of contrast this paints between Belle and the average French young lady at the time (the bimbettes). It shows that belle isn't really the appearance that the beast would usually be a fan of either, or of what beast would be expected to marry (beast also made a comment about that when talking to his servants - her birth would be important to him, and adds another complexity to the curse. Obviously he couldn't just invite princesses over.) 

That kind of leads into one of my other favorite and unmentioned parts. I love the part that Agatha plays. The enchantress is the source of everything magic in the animated classic, yet she is only mentioned in the beginning. Here, Agatha almost seems to want the beast to win, as she manipulates the rules (and even may have caused the whole story to start, if she caused the lightning to hit the tree). She makes sure Maurice survives and seems to balance even the townspeople and their world. She lives as a ""hag"" which I thought was really clever. When she started climbing the stairs after the big battle I got really curious about her, and then she wordlessly resurrects the beast in the end, it showed her as a benevolent Demi-god that wanted the best for the beast. I love it because it really seems to fit that era's take on magic, and makes a fun little trope out of the hag/witch in the woods kind of thing. 

I agree with many of the other comments here, between the characters being well casted and Emma Watson clearly not having a strong singing voice (which, unlike phantom/Gerard butler in Phantom, isn't a critical plot point) and Gaston being absolutely perfect. LeFeu was actually a nuanced character, as well as Maurice. I like how they rewrote some parts and answered questions in others. 

It felt like a real world, fleshed out version of the animated classic. Perfect foil. ",5zuxzg
df1efl7,"Putting nostalgia aside, I enjoyed this movie more than the animated version.  I know, I know, blasphemy.  But there were some things that I think this did much better.

For example, they closed the plot hole of why none of these villagers seem to know there's a fucking castle within marching distance.

Gaston actually acts like a guy trying to get Belle to marry him and actually follows Maurice at first until he loses his patience.

LeFou isn't a simpering waste of space lackey.

I think the biggest strength of the live action comes to the Beast, however.  I always felt like, in the original, it never really made a ton of sense why Belle fell in love with him.  Like, he saved her, yeah, and they played a little in the snow, but she's already falling for him at that point, so the romance always felt sort of half assed.  It always felt like she was giving him a pity fuck more than she actually cared about him.  This movie made him more of a character, delved into him, and gave him and Belle more room to interact.  He's a proper partner for Belle, who is touted as little miss independent and free thinker, so it makes it more believable when she falls in love with the educated, intellectual and sometimes sarcastically witty Beast from the live action.

Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, Luke Evans and Josh Gad absolutely killed it.  Emma Thompson was great too.  They brought a sense of plight to the characters.

I also liked that Maurice wasn't 100% crackpot.  He felt more like Belle's father and the person who raised her.  A little weird, a little eccentric and probably too smart for his own good compared to the world around him.

My only criticism was that I don't think Emma Watson was particularly stand out.  Her facial expressions seemed very out of place in several places and her singing left quite a bit to desire.

They expanded some of the inanimate character roster by making Plumette actually have a character other than 'sexy maid feather duster' and the piano was awesome too.

I honestly thought it was great and made a lot of great choices.  There were some continuity errors, but none of them jarred me enough to take me out of the fun.  The castle design was excellent and all the visual effects were beautiful.  ""Be Our Guest"" especially was a massive treat for the eyes.

Thought it was awesome and I'll probably consider it the definitive version, TBH.  I'll probably swap Emma's voice with animated Belle's in my mind though.

Anyways, my two cents.",5zuxzg
df6nfri,"I had a big dumb grin on my face from the moment the music started. I loved the music and the sets, they were so beautiful.

The first dance scene between Beast and Belle was magical. The Beast didn't seem nearly as scary as he did in the animated version.

The biggest disappointment for me was Emma Watson - it's clear she is the only person in the cast that doesn't know how to sing, her vocal performance was weak compared to everyone else. Overall though, I really enjoyed the film!",5zuxzg
dfeb3g8,I really liked what they did with Hogwarts this time around. ,5zuxzg
dffb2ch,"What I don't get about the West Wing in either movie:

JUST EXPLAIN TO BELLE THAT IT'S THE BEAST'S BEDROOM, because it is.

You are a guest (... well, prisoner) in his home. You do not necessarily have the right to invite yourself into his private bedchamber. No wonder he was upset. It was messy with all the torn rags in the corner (maybe clothes he's ripped trying to fit into them). That's mortifying. The destroyed family portrait. Then there's the rose, which is particularly attractive simply because of how it is displayed on the table on the balcony, the centre of attention.

The animated film shows a bed in the West Wing (albeit shrouded in darkness) that is lopsided, probably because the leg was either broken in anger or by the sheer weight of the Beast, and, again, it is covered in rags.

The new film makes it much more explicit that the West Wing is his bedroom, with the Beast actually sleeping in his four-poster.

The West Wing may also have been his mother's death chamber, as seen in the flashback. She would have died in the master suite, which generally has the biggest bed. The Beast would have needed that larger bed after the curse fell.

It also wouldn't surprise me if Belle's room used to be the Beast's childhood bedroom, and he's put his mother's dresses in the armoire and her personal effects in the room so he doesn't have to look at them, hence why the room looks like it belonged to a woman. This is possibly the real reason he was so upset about giving her a bedroom - that Lumiere showed her to *that* room in particular.

Oh, and did anyone catch the nod to *Moulin Rouge!* during ""Be Our Guest""? Cogsworth comes out of an Indian palace in a turban very similar to the one Harold Zidler wears when he plays the Evil Maharajah in the ""Spectacular Spectacular"" finale. For those playing at home, Ewan McGregor (Lumiere) played Christian in the film.

TL;DR: I notice strange details.",5zuxzg

df4ls1r,"Overall, I really liked it! Beauty and the Beast is my favorite Disney movie of all time. I've seen it countless of times, I've seen the musical 4 times, hell I even have the musical soundtrack in 4 different languages! So I had extremely high expectations for this rendition.  I really liked some added details, which really closed up some plot holes, specifically the hole of the townspeople not knowing about the castle or the prince. Also, it's nice that they hammered the fact that the prince was not a boy when he was enchanted, that actually makes much more sense now. I really did like the added backstory to the prince, it humanized him more. It also makes sense that the prince would be very well educated with a library that large, though I suppose it's now not canon that Belle doesn't teach him to read (though that storyline was only ever in the musical adaptation). Some of the new songs were good, but I hoped they would use some of the musical numbers like ""if I can't love her."" They did add some instrumental renditions of musical numbers so that was a nice touch. 

The only downside to the movie was unfortunately Emma Watson. I'm sad to say but I think Emma Watson is the new Kristen Stewart. She has the same basic facial expression.

In the animated movie she is talking to sheep, which is perfectly acceptable.

 But in the live action, she is talking to literally no one. No one! She is just spinning in circles while everyone ignores her.

When the spouses of the servants come to visit them at the end, they are still within the age range of their un-cursed spouses. These spouses are not considerably older or dead. So less than 10 years easy.

I can't remember much of the original movie itself, but I still remember the songs as they are often brought up in school and community choir performances, classics like the title song or Be Our Guest are too good to be forgotten. 
 
Beauty and the Beast is a musical. Sure there are singing in The Jungle Book, but music is the life and soul of Beauty and the Beast. The magic in this movie comes to life with the music. Alan Menken returned once again to score the music for the remake, the soundtrack is familiar yet much more lush, rich, sweet and modern. Obviously, we can't run away from the classics such as the title song *Beauty and The Beast*, *Something There*, *Gaston* and *Be Our Guest*, they are brought back with fresh orchestration and a much more lavish set. Unsurprisingly the story remained the same as a whole, it's a modern remake after all, why change the story when it was perfect in the first place? 

Yet Alan Menken still managed to surprise me with the new additions. **How Does A Moment Last Forever** was created to tell the story of Belle's family, giving us the backstory of why Maurice love Belle the way he did. It's a song of realization and empathy. The scene where Beast brought Belle to the attic in Paris was bittersweet and poignant -- she found out the reason of her mom's death, and it  strengthened Belle's love for her father even more. Beast came to empathize with Belle, they both lost their parents in one way or another after all. One thing that stood out to me with that scene was Belle told Beast, ""Let's go home"", and Beast was startled for a moment. Belle referred the castle as ""home"". 

**Days In The Sun** was added as a recurring theme that is sprinkled across the movie. It's a hopeful song that is brought to life by the wonderful cast, reminiscing the happy days of the past. It lingered in the background in many scenes, adding to the sense of hope and longing for something or someone to bring the sun and warmth to everyone in the castle. There was a scene when Belle was reading poetry to Beast, and for the first time in a long time there was no snow, it's sunny outside, and the lake's snow has melted. Belle is the sun that the castle needs, she is warming Beast's heart. 

The highlight of the movie, to me, without doubt is **Evermore**. The transition from *Beauty and the Beast* into Evermore was done beautifully, when Mrs Potts was just talking about how *bittersweet and strange, finding you can change, learning you were wrong*, Beast came to the realization himself that he had, in fact, changed. 

> Now I know she'll never leave me

> Even as she runs away

> She will still torment me, calm me, hurt me

> Move me, come what may   

> Wasting in my lonely tower

> Waiting by an open door

> I'll fool myself she'll walk right in

> And be with me for evermore

I legitimately teared up when Dan Stevens sang that last phrase. *I'll fool myself she'll walk right in, and be with me for evermore*. I agree with some reviews that this song is easily the best part of the movie. Stevens' baritone voice was strong and powerful as Beast, yet it showed such vulnerability and pain underneath that facade. He lets her go because he wanted her to be happy, yet it hurts him so that he might never see her again. He realized he's capable of falling in love, of feeling love, of losing someone he loved.  

Oh man, this is turning into a huge wall of text LOL. I guess I'll just end this by saying I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. Sure it has its flaws, the singing isn't top notch, but unlike stage musicals, movie musicals aren't so much about the actor and actresses singing ability anyway, the music is coupled with the acting to add to the characters and the story. Certain as the sun rising in the east, to me Beauty and the Beast will still go down in history as one of the best musicals Disney has ever produced. No matter what medium they choose to tell the story and perform the music -- as an animation, on broadway, or as a live action movie, it is still a Disney classic that will be relived for evermore.",5zuxzg
dfknql5,"I really really wanted to love this movie.  Overall, it was an above average movie for me but fell far short of the hype.

1) Some far shots of the Beast and Belle looked terribly composited.

2) The acting felt flat, like they were just going through the motions, except for Luke and Josh.  

3) Too much screen time of the Beast being mean and cold-hearted, too little screen time of the Beast becoming dear.  It's like one scene he's a dick, then suddenly he's nice.  It's like he flipped a switch, ""This Belle chic is my ticket outta this curse!""

4) Belle's transition from captive of the beast to captivated by the beast wasn't believable. The animated version was able to achieve this believability in a film whose run-time is markedly shorter.  It didn't feel like Belle authentically fell in love with the Beast.  Maybe Watson just isn't capable of doing a good love scene?

5) The new songs weren't good. 

6) With all the extra minutes they added, the scenes still seemed incongruous.

7) Emma just doesn't have that classic sounding Disney Singing Princess voice.  And if Disney cast Emma for her acting ability, she didn't deliver on that either.  So, Disney basically just cast Emma for her looks.  She couldn't even do a French accent.  What kind of A List actor is that?

8) Too much autotune.

9) Kevin Kline's acting was horribly lazy and you could tell.

10)  The ballroom dancing scene between Beast and Belle gave me no feelings at all, because there weren't any feelings between the two characters.  In the animated version, the same scene totally gives the audience ""the feels"".  This could've been attributed to the weird cockney accent Emma brought to the love ballad during this scene.

Don't get me wrong, the early scene with the town folk was gorgeous and 100% musical Disney, I loved it!  But the rest of the film just went downhill from there.  Except for the bar keep scene with Gaston and Le Fou.",5zuxzg
df1k7dc,"Surprisingly, I didn't love it. I did like it! It certainly wasn't a bad movie, and many parts were very good, but it just didn't grab me like I thought it would.  
  
I'm a big Disney fan, but the only other remake I've seen is Jungle Book, and I loved that, so I had high expectations for this. Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorites, and all signs were pointing to it being very good, so I'm kind of surprised that I walked out feeling kind of lukewarm about it.  
  
First off, Emma Watson didn't do anything for me here. I normally like Emma, and while she wouldn't have been my first choice for Belle, I was positive she was going to do a great job. But I don't know, she was just lacking something that made the original Belle so interesting. She felt flat. Like, I only felt like she likes books a lot because she tells us she likes books. I didn't ""feel"" it in her character. She didn't sell Belle to me, and if I only had this movie to judge off of, I would have thought Belle was a very average, boring character.  
  
Second, I feel like the movie was better in during the moments where it was trying to do its own thing. I feel like too many moments were shot for shot, line for line recreations of the original scenes, to the point where I could guess the dialogue. In those moments, I couldn't help but think, ""what's the point?"" 

The Jungle Book felt like a much better example of a film that stays true to the spirit of the source material, while establishing its own identity. Beauty and the Best was so 1:1 at so many moments, and I feel like it would have benefitted from going its own way. This wasn't helped with the inclusion of all the original songs, which, while very good songs, forced them to stick very closely to the narrative of the original. I probably would have preferred to keep the songs confined to the original, and use the freed up space to develop the characters and plot more.  
  
High points: Beast, while I wouldn't say was *better* than the original, seemed like a more developed character and a better fit for Belle. Luke Evans was great as Gaston, and Josh Gad's LeFou was fun, and I liked his little arc. I quite enjoyed Lumiere and Cogsworth.  
  
Overall, I *liked* it, but I didn't really love it, and I'll probably just stick with the original. Can anyone change my view?",5zuxzg
dfmouau,"Listening to ""Evermore"" on repeat ever since I walked out of the theater. A wonderful new song from a such a heartbreaking moment in the film. 

>Wasting in my lonely tower 
Waiting by an open door
I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in
And as the long, long nights begin
I'll think of all that might have been
Waiting here for evermore

*DAMN!* love it.",5zuxzg
df1jyct,"The good:

- A very humble humble-brag here, but I absolutely *loved* how they (or someone on the cast) seemed to incorporate [a theory I wrote about Maurice being an automaton maker](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/4lza12/beauty_and_the_beast_belles_father_maurice/?ref=search_posts) a while back on /r/fantheories. We actually see him make miniature automata in the film. It was so joyously true to French history at the time, and the theme of the Beast's servants, that I loved it. It just shows how much dedication, care, and love that Maurice puts into his work, and absolutely, *perfectly* tips its hat towards being accurate to historical French culture.

- Emma Watson and Dan Stevens, at least to me, had good chemistry. I nearly cried a few times at the scenes where the Beast learned about Belle's backstory and history (and the fate of Belle's mother). Most ""real"" moments of the film for me on Watson's part, and the chemistry / interactions between Watson and Stevens so painfully, heart-breakingly real during it. 

- Dan Stevens killed it as the Beast. He even perfectly mirrored the animated Prince's scene and movements after the transformation at the end. Grace (or Grace Reviews) complained that Dan Stevens ""wasn't hot enough"", but I wholly disagree. I also deeply enjoyed the symbolism and contrast between the Prince at the beginning of the film (""poof poof"" Prince, or ""Prince Poofball""), with his ""masque"" on, and the Prince at the end (no makeup, natural). It really shows the drastic effects that Belle had on him. 

- Loved how we got way more character development for the Beast, and more changes / backstory / development to Belle (to a lesser degree), Maurice, Gaston, and especially Le Fou. The Beast's servants also got a a lot of development that caused me to be invested in their characters (and fates) as a viewer. I felt like I could actually care about the servants as characters, as well as the Beast.

------------------

The bad:

- As I've said elswhere on this thread, personally, I thought that Emma Watson seemed to have ""the Kristen Stewart effect"" in a few or more scenes. That is, her face / acting didn't feature many emotions, and her acting seemed very wooden at times. Emma also had very cringe-worthy acting in scenes at times, namely, with how disinterested / un-emotional she seemed when Gaston confronted her with the flowers. However, in her defense, she *does* get better once Dan Stevens enters the picture.

- As said elswhere on this thread, for me, Emma's voice seemed very flat and toneless to me for most of the film. It was alright for the opening scene (""Belle""), and even more believable; but as the film went on, her singing just seemed sort of overshadowed and out-of-place by those with better singing voices and talent. One of Emma's major flaws, for me, is that she tends to be so rational / logical in her approach to the character, that she completely closes herself off / seems un-emotional. This caused the quality of her acting to suffer in quite a few scenes, as well as her singing. There's a difference between ""giving a performance"" (whereas the actor focuses too much on lines / seems wooden) and ""acting"" (making it seem believable), and Emma's was the former for me.

- Bill Condon seems to have completely forgotten about resolving the Beast's backstory, and that annoys me. We get Belle's backstory, even Maurice's (to an extent). Yet Beast's backstory is hinted at, but seems to have been largely cut out, for some reason or another. In fact, it seemed, to me, a largely ""unfinished"" aspect of the movie. Instead, there are huge, *huge* hints and questions raised by Beast's backstory, especially since Disney decided to use the portrait of one of France's most famous Kings (Louis XIV, ""the Sun King"") for Beast's father! This would imply that Beast *was the Crown Prince* (Dauphin) of France, and next in line to become King. It also raises questions of, ""Why was Beast's father, the King, absent in his later adult life?"", ""Why does Beast's mother not match the portrait of her?"", ""Why would the Crown Prince / heir apparent of the French throne be by himself in a remote *chateau* (castle)?"", and ""What does this mean for Belle, who is pretty much a peasant, with no royal training or unbringing, and who is presumably the new Queen Consort of France?""

- Gaston's backstory, too, is never really fully explored. He mentions having served as a soldier / officer in ""the War"", and is even a ""war hero"", but then the War itself is never really directly referenced. (i.e. ""What War did Gaston fight in?"") Likewise, it's implied that Le Fou and the three other guys who make up Gaston's gang served under him during said War, and Le Fou even comforts Gaston by telling him to ""think of the War"". Gaston also is seemingly wealthy, as he owns an expensive horse (a German Friesian - very expensive breed), dresses in a fine outfit, etc. This raises the question of, ""How and why is he so rich?"" There was potential here to make Gaston a far more complex, interesting character, and I feel that was wasted, especially given how popular Gaston is with the audience.

---------------------------

Overall, I give this film a 8.5/10. Definitely enjoyable, and would go see again. I would see it in IMAX, but the 3-D isn't really worth it. Emma Watson is so-so for me, but the other actors are impeccably cast. Also lots of stunning visuals, and very emotional / poignant scenes. All in all, a very fun time to be had!

-----------

(As an edit, I realized later, Emma Watson's wooden acting might actually be the director Bill Condon's fault. Condon also directed Kristen Stewart, who had the same issues as Watson, in *The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1*.)",5zuxzg
df786w8,"So what I'm seeing is that the ballroom scene is divisive. People either loved it or hated it. I, personally, was moved to weeping by it. 

Where this film was strongest was when it was improving on the original. I loved actually seeing the scenario by which the Prince was initially transformed. I loved the explanation behind why everyone seemed to forget the monarchy. I loved the ""Mr. Potts"" moment. The added subplot between The Beast and Belle about mothers, the added conversations between Beast and Belle. It all worked so well to enrich the source material.

The score was vastly improved, both by richer instrumentation and added songs. The songs really did add to the complexity of the plot, especially ""Evemore"" and ""Days in the Sun"". Everything just meshed so well. 

The only thing, oddly, I found out of place was LeFou's character additions. Not that I have a problem with it or anything - it worked to a certain extent. But towards the end, the movie loses its footing with LeFou, to the point where by the end, it feels very shoe-horned and not the service to the LGBT community I feel it was supposed to be. 

Overall, I loved it all so, so much. Saw it twice over the weekend, will probably see it again.",5zuxzg
dfiuejp,"Honestly, I think these live action remakes benefit the movies with weaknesses that can be improved. Cinderella, Maleficent, and Jungle Book all tried to improve the storyline of the originals. (Maleficent was mediocre but still, it was a different approach)

BATB was already a 10/10 tier story and the remake changed very little. It was fun to watch this remake but I have little incentive to watch it again over the original if I have a choice. ",5zuxzg
df1bgws,"The animated Beauty and the Beast is a near perfect film in my mind. (And probably in my top five favorite films of all time.) It was a great, emotional story that was tightly edited with memorable songs, and is still often considered by many to be Disney's greatest movie. It was also the first animated film to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, and the Best Animated Movie category was added to future Oscars because of it. So the new, live-action remake had a lot to live up to.

Having said that, the remake is absolutely magical and comes as close to matching the perfection of the animated film as I could ever have had hoped for. This new film has all the same characters, songs (performed extraordinarily well), and beats that made people fall in love with the original, while being different enough and adding enough new story to justify its existence. In a lot of respects, it actually deepens the original film in surprising ways. (LeFou's redemption; the expansion of the Enchantress' part; making Maurice and Gaston less cartoonish; the backstories of Belle and the Beast; etc.) Think of this new version as the junior novelization compared to the original's children's storybook.

I absolutely loved it. And my wife really liked it, which is saying something, because she didn't like the animated version. 100% recommend it! You won't be disappointed. You'll love it if you loved the animated film, and maybe even like it if you didn't. 

I will single out one change in particular that I loved - the change to the ending. I like how Belle didn't beat the last petal falling and that not only did the Beast die, but all of the enchanted objects did as well. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see them all lose their sentience - Madame Gardarobe and Cadesta sharing their last moment with the ""dog""; Mrs. Potts not seeing Chip before she fades away; etc. It was a good addition to make the already emotional climax that much more powerful, and made it even more joyous when the Enchantress undoes the curse. (I loved the Enchantress' extended role in general! And loved that she took pity on the Beast even though Belle didn't say she loved him in time.) ",5zuxzg

dfa95ag,"I thoroughly enjoyed this, but I will caveat it's mainly due to sentimental reasons. Beauty and the Beast is my favorite Disney Renaissance era movie. It was to me what little girls experienced for Frozen.

I think Emma did a fine job acting, although her singing was mediocre to fine at best. It was not as moving like the original. Josh Gad, Ewan McGregor (who I did not even know was in the movie!) did superb singing numbers... as did the guy that played Gaston. He played a very believable conceited prick. I do wish he had more sleeveless scenes to demonstrate his muscles... would have been more comical.

Beast was not a scary looking persona. They seemed to have put more human features in him then the original. His nose looked like a human's nose. His horns pointed back, which made him look less menacing.

The CGI was impressive, especially with the intricate moving parts in Cogsworth, the bronze folds of Lumière and the draperies in the dresser lady. Parts of it felt a lot like a Disney ride, especially in the ""Be Our Guest"" sequence. 

Nice addition to Beast and Belle's backstories. It kind of fills in the perpetual ""where is [character's] dad/mom?"" question you ask in the Disney animations.

Really great family film overall... probably a good date movie if your partner can take the Disney cheese and magic.",5zuxzg

df5hg1u,"Loved: 

- The backstories. Both Belle and the Beast's. It made the story a lot more robust, gave the Beast's rose a new meaning, and made his imprisonment of Maurice over a stolen rose a *little* more credible (""I got a life sentence over a rose, why shouldn't he?"").
- Their falling in love with a bit more dialogue. It seemed more genuine, especially when he starts quoting Shakespeare (in contrast to Gaston's not wanting to be near a book). The little jokes and smiles, there something about seeing it brought to life that gave me honest chills.
- Gaston and LeFou
- Costumes
- Evermore

Didn't love:

- The object's animation. I thought maybe they were too realistic? Lumière, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts, who are suck expressive characters in the original, were ""reduced"" to lifeless versions of themselves, and I thought that was a real shame. I just felt that there was a lot missing.
- Emma Watson. And I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, maybe that's why, but acting-wise, I thought it was a bland performance. Nothing surprising, nothing awe-inspiring, just... Emma Watson. I feel she always has the same handful of facial expressions, and we never get to see a lot of range from her, acting-wise.

Overall a *great* remake. I left the theaters completely overtaken by feelings of love and joy and hope.",5zuxzg

Still, McrGregor, Evans, and Stevens were so good in this film. Loved the Evermore song, was not expecting it. Lots of great backstory, too, and I like how the village remembers the castle and everyone at the end.

* The timeline of the curse being fixed and making more sense.

* No Stockholm syndrome as we get time to see Belle and the Beast fall in love.

* The Beast loves to read as much as Belle, and he’s funny and charming.

* Gaston here is still an arrogant prick but not as dumb as his animated counterpart.

dfdv5ks,Did anyone else notice something *off* about Emma Watson's voice when she sang? it seemed heavily auto-tuned and artificial ,5zuxzg
dk4xh6q,"I know pretty much no one will read this, but whatever. I want to write my personal thoughts about this movie, because finally I watched it (I couldn't watch it in the theatres because I had college exams on that time, and the Apple TV in my country took like a million years to release it, so here I go!).
To start, after the typical Disney logo (the castle and that dramatic song that plays every time in Disney movies) appeared, a beast claw appeared in the screen and grabbed a rose, while the movie theme played. That was the very moment I had the feeling that the movie was going to suck.
In the begging of the movie, what caught my attention (in a very bad way) was the CGI. It was terrible. No, I'm not ONLY talking about the characters (* cough* Lumière *cough* the Beast *cough*), but the cgi landscape was pitiful. When Belle is singing about not wanting to marry Gaston and then she runs to the fields and continues to sing, the camera swirls around her and we can see the forest in the background. The forest was cgi made, and it was terrible, I could tell that it was fake. Okay, maybe it was alright for them to make it cgi. If it was done well, I wouldn't be complaining about it, but it was laughable.
Then, we have the scenario. It was also very bad. So bad that I noticed the snow was fake (Belle's father takes the rose from the Beat's garden and Belle and The Beast talking after they dance in the ballroom), Agatha's hideout in the forest felt horribly artificial in the scene; when the camera would take long shots away from the window to show the whole castle; when Belle and the Beast look at the frozen lake; when Lumière and Clogsworth (or whatever their names are spelled) take belle out of the dungeon; ALL of those scenes the scenario was terrible.
Emma Watson as Belle sucked. No, I'm not saying that ""Emma Watson is not beautiful enough to be Belle"" crap, I'm talking about the 'new' Belle Emma Watson wanted to be. So, basically this new Belle mostly frowned and would quarrel with the Beast, leaving the sweetness and kindness of the 1991 animated version of Belle behind; the emotional scene when Belle offers herself to stay in her father's place was changed for Belle pushing her father away and locking herself in (I guess that was an attempt of empower Belle or whatever that shit was). The pain Belle felt for loosing her father and her freedom in one day was shoved aside for Belle trying already to escape (again to show ""how strong Belle is"", I think). The love between belle and the beast in the movie were mostly portrayed as both of them reading poems together ( *eye roll* ). When the Beast asks belle if she is happy with him, in the cartoon she says yes but misses her father, while in the live action version, her answer is ""how can I be happy if I'm not free"" crap. Shit.
At least, the Evermore song was good, because all of the new songs sucked, and so did that ""magical book"" scene that transports them to Paris (that was a huge bullshit). 
I was expecting at least the fight between Gaston and the beast to be good, but even that wasn't that great. Instead of gaston betraying Beast's act of mercy of sparing his life, he still stabbed the Beast from behind, and while he was confident that he was the one who prevailed the combat, he fell from the roof. A dramatic death, instead of just gaston being in the wrong place in the wrong time, because the bridge he was standing crumbled as the castle was being destroyed. 
Then, what I was also expecting to be an emotional scene of belle and the beast saying their final words for each other, just like in the 1991 cartoon, it didn't have half of the chemistry between Emma Watson and the cgi beast Dan Stevens, and they still made her to kiss the beast (an useless attempt of her showing her love for him) instead of crying and saying ""I love you"". The scene where the Beast was being healed and transformed into a human again (by Agatha who happens to be the witch, wtf??) was bad too. Emma Watson just staring the whole thing happening reminded me of Kristen Stewart in twilight (that's how bad it was).
Dan Stevens didn't look good with long hair.
And finally, the last scene would have been pretty descent, if only Dan Stevens wasn't wearing that ridiculous wig and ""snarls"" like the beast. That was my final face palm in this 2 hour movie. 
I never thought a movie like this would be so badly handled. Bill Condon was a terrible choice to direct it. ",5zuxzg

Overall it was nothing amazing but nothing horrible, and nothing to watch over the animated version. This is the first film I've seen Emma Watson in since the Harry Potter series and I've got to say she was pretty bland. She seemed disinterested the whole time and unable to really give any emotion beyond the occasional smile or sad groan. I never felt myself feeling that it was Belle choosing to do something rather than Watson following the script. The only other complaint I have is that the CGI was pretty weak. The physical sets looked fantastic but when it was CGI it lost all of it's charm. This also caused problems with Beast, limiting most of his facial expressions to just his lips and a little bit of his brow.

As far as what I did like, I loved the banter between Gaston and LeFou. It's fun watching Gaston be a cocky jerk while LeFou responds with witty little lines. The Beast's dialog was also well done mostly when he and Belle were starting their friendship. Once he was allowed to express something other than anger I was really pulled in with his defeated tone. He seemed demoralized and tired because of the curse he'd received years ago, and watching him regain some humanity once Belle opened up with him was nice.

df5ct2d,"My wife and I loved it. Very faithful to the original. Not many changes, more like additions which is what I'll focus my comments on. I saw several reviews saying that this version didn't add anything of substance. I don't know how anyone could come away thinking that. The added back story for The Beast/Prince made him more sympathetic as we know why he was such a snob. Belle didn't need to be more sympathetic, but the new back story of her family, particularly her mother's death, which she discovered with The Beast, gave them something in common since his mother also died when he was young, and makes them growing closer more believable and helps explain how his cold heart begins to melt. The new music is good as well and fits in with the original songs despite being written so far apart. As many times as I've seen the original, it never struck me that The Beast didn't have a solo, but boy has that been corrected. Evermore is amazing. I love how it starts with Beast's theme and the placement within the film is perfect. It's such a reflective song and having him sing it from his ""lonely tower"" as he's set Belle free and she's riding away from the castle is just perfect. I thought the cast overall was perfect. I can't believe some people think Gaston was miscast. Emma Thompson really stood out as Mrs. Potts as well. Overall 9/10. I thought it was even better than Cinderella and The Jungle Book which I really liked as well.",5zuxzg
df6rbc9,"Complete nitpicking, but it would have been nice if the Bimbettes had kept their red/green/yellow dresses instead of the same pink one. I honestly wasn’t sure it was supposed to be them until the tavern scene lmao. Little Town was great, but it would have been perfect if Luke Evans had began jumping on the roofs, like Gaston is supposed to. And if they’d kept the fountain scene, and made everything a bit more ""chaotic"" as it is supposed to.",5zuxzg
dfsurd9,I was not expecting to like this as much as I did--the opening scene alone won me over.,5zuxzg
dgc331w,"I really enjoyed the movie, although a lot of that is probably nostalgia. 

I thought Luke Evans absolutely killed it as Gaston, I liked the whole war hero backstory, and I thought he made Gaston more malicious and unlikeable than the original. I loved 'Kill the Beast' - probably my favourite part of the film. I thought Josh Gad did a good job too.

Emma Watson's singing was far too autotuned, to the point where it didn't sound human anymore, which sucks for a character who is meant to be...well...so humane. I'm a big HP fan, and of course she plays the book-loving side to Belle well, but there is much more to the character than that, so it's not really enough to justify it.

I thought that Belle and the Beast went from really disliking each other to having feelings for each other pretty quickly. The 'Days in the Sun' song made Belle fall for Beast faster than expected, I thought they could have just focused on their friendship a bit more before making them fall in love. I'm not sure the changed structure of the library scene worked either. In the original, the Beast quite obviously does it as a kind gesture as his feelings are starting to develop, whereas in this he sort of begrudgingly shows her it, it felt less romantic somehow. 

Also, I liked Ian McKellen, who of course did justice to the role, and had some great one liners. Good chemistry with Lumière as well (although his accent felt a bit off).

All in all, really enjoyed the film, Luke Evans was the star for me, but some issues with singing and character development.",5zuxzg

df5awcq,Evermore was amazing ,5zuxzg
df6gfp6,"I don't understand people who won't go to this movie because it has a gay character. The only few places where LeFou could have been gay was the Gaston song and the end where Gaston asked him on why he wasn't married yet. Also in the end where he ""coincidentally"" ended up dancing with a guy. That's it. Little kids wouldn't recognise it as gay scene, only that he's a loyal minion. I thought that Cogsworth was actually gay, since he was all Mon Ami to Lumiere and seemingly didn't love his wife. Thought he'll end up with LeFou.

I really enjoyed the addition of parents, like Belle's mom and Prince's father. Didn't like the flashback. We already knew his mother died and his father turned the innocent boy into ruthless man, the flashback was only to show the cuteness of young Prince.

Belle's father was the best father ever. No matter what happened to him, he never gave away his daughter's hand to Gaston. Even when he was about to be locked away in asyllum, he never betrayed Belle. ",5zuxzg
dg4vquc,"Loved everything except for Emma Watson's horribly auto-tuned voice. If I ever watch the movie again I will have to skip over her singing.If there was an option to buy this movie with the animated Belle's singing, I would buy it in a heartbeat.",5zuxzg
dhx7e5s,"Very late to this thread but figured I'd share.

I thought Gaston was great. Though I'm not sure I cared for the making of him even more malicious. The acting of him was superb.

I think Emma Watson is a pretty girl. But Plumette was more of a beauty than her when we finally see her again in the end scenes. And her auto-tuning... yeah, I just think someone could have done the part better.

The new songs weren't that stellar but the costumes and the palace looked amazing. I guess I should assume no less with a Disney film. Also, Belle getting clobbered with a monstrous snowball made me laugh very hard.

I'd say it's a solid 5/10 or 6/10 movie. You'd enjoy it if you were a fan of the original or a child but I don't know how well it would do on it's own without a truckload of nostalgia.",5zuxzg

I also got pointless filler, mediocre singing, and some new songs which were written to pad a run time when superior songs from the musical would've worked perfectly. Thats what really bugged me.

1) Lets get this out there first..Emma Watson is a good actor but Disney should have Voiced over her singing parts. Like they do it the animated films.

2)People have to realise that it's more of an adaption of the THEATRE version rather than the animated movie version.

3) The acting was great from the supporting cast. 

4) Ewan MacGregor was great a lumiere, but i felt he had more of a Quebecois Accent than a French one...(Canadians will get this reference)

df6snr8,"For everything new this movie did that I loved, they did something I didn't like or was more confused by the decision.  I loved the Belle Maurice scene at the start.  I really enjoyed how Maurice reacted to the castle inhabitants, and.....ok maybe I just really like Kevin Kline as Maurice.  

What bothered me was how the Beast's song seemed a bit out of place.  I understand what it was suppose to do, but he seemed to happy and uplifted.  He, in his mind really thought he would never see Belle ever again.  Yes he is in love, but he just doomed all the servants and himself.  I think it was a little earlier it could of worked a bit better maybe.  *Shrug*  I don't know it just took me out of the movie a bit.

Chip 'skateboarding' on the plate was not needed, and was, truth be told, really really stupid.  The fact that it happen almost every time we see him didn't help.

Perhaps it has been a while sense I watched the animated version, but Lafou paying people in the tavern throughout the song 'Gaston' made my day.  The fact that in a way the townspeople are not 100% behind Gaston is sort of a nice touch, but hell some money will make them love him!

Speaking of the servants [the fact that they are slowly becoming more and more like the objects, to the point where once that last rose petal falls down they all start to become just the objects.  Ms. Potts yelling in fear for Chip in her last moments, damn made me near cry!  And Cogsworth final moments too.  But if the castle was crumbling with each rose petal, shouldn't of the castle completely fallen down with the last petal?](#spoiler)",5zuxzg
dfj9y9b,"I went and saw this on the weekend. I did enjoy it, but, like other people on here, I didn't feel like it did much to improve upon the original animated film. Hell, with the amount of CG in this film, it might as well have been animated.",5zuxzg
diknsi5,"Last night I finally rented the new Beauty and the Beast. Wasn't really...impressed at all. Nothing really stood out to me because it felt like just a copy of the animated movie. The autotuned music was bad. Love Emma Watson, but bad pick for a somewhat musical. They should have either written off the music with good storytelling if they wanted her.

My favorite live action rendition of a Disney movie is going to stay with Maleficent. 

I've still got about 20 minutes left, we'll see if it turns around. But I almost don't want to. ",5zuxzg
df4bka8,"Saw the decent reviews so I snagged a ticket to a later showing. Wow, as an action/thriller junkie who has never even seen most original Disney flicks including Beauty and the Beast, I thought this movie was very well-done. It wasn't cheesy or kid-oriented, really a movie for all ages across time. I am actually a giant fan of romance novels and movies, but so much of the new stuff has been garbage, so I walked in with low expectations. I love how Belle was attracted to Beast's library, especially as someone who reads. And boy did Lumière and Cogsworth kill the show, so much that I found them far more memorable than Belle and Beast. Overall, I thought the pacing was good - the chemistry between the leads was believable...   

Some things that annoyed me though:

* Why does it seem like the journey from the village to the castle is either absolutely treacherous or a breeze? How did Belle get there so quickly at the end?  
* What's the story behind Agathe? That wasn't really spelled out (pun intended) in the movie.  
* They made Beast come off as gay af in the beginning   

All in all, I really did like it far more than I had anticipated. I hate musicals and cheesy story tales, but Beauty and the Beast was quite the treat. ",5zuxzg
df5rc2u,[deleted],5zuxzg
dffx451,"I liked the character work in the film. Gaston, while still a very clear villain, was less over-the-top and a more human villain. He's not as one-dimensional. His interest in Belle isn't purely based on her beauty but rather the challenge she presents. Her intelligence isn't something that he's ""willing to overlook,"" it actually adds to his interest in her. He pretends to share interest in the things that Belle likes, much like real guys do. He tries to help Maurice retrieve Belle because he wants to make himself look good to Belle, which is a much more human strategy than ""imprison her father to blackmail her."" Adding that he's a war hero also adds a lot of depth and explains the town's affection for him.  
LeFou's story was handled very well. He was made clear to be gay without it being the defining trademark of his character and his turn away from Gaston developed organically through the film. You see his apprehension with Gaston's treatment of Maurice, then you see it grow during ""Kill the Beast,"" and then, finally, his turn in the castle. It wasn't a jilted lover angle or any other problematic gay stereotype. They walked the line perfectly with him.  
The Beast's character was handled well too. He was given a backstory that explains how there could possibly be something good underneath. He isn't illiterate (which is something that never made any sense in the original). The relationship with Belle develops more organically (largely because they have more time) and doesn't feel as much like Stockholm syndrome.  
Overall, the film handled the characters and story well. There were also some nice little touches (figuring out why Mr. Potts couldn't remember what he had lost, for example) that added something to the experience.  
The problems with the film are small. The new songs largely fell flat, some of the CGI work was sub-par, some scenes are a little bit too similar to the original, and the opening is a bit weak. It also wasn't ground-breaking in any way. It pretty much was exactly what you would expect it to be going in. But overall, I found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable film. 7/10 for me.",5zuxzg
dfi2w1e,"I just saw it a few hours ago. Was pleasantly surprised how much I liked it. I'm not really a fan of Emma Watson but I thought she did a good job. She was clearly autotuned but it didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. A lot of people have been criticizing her non-reaction during the ""Be Our Guest"" sequence but I mean...she had just been taken prisoner, had a screaming match with a beast, lost her dad and now the fucking dishes are dancing. I'm sure realistically Belle would have been like ""What the fuck is my life"" than clapping and smiling at the show. Biggest thing that helped the movie is that I thought her and Dan had great chemistry. It was believable to watch them fall for each other. Lumiere was incredible.

Pros:

1.) Emma Watson portrayed Belle perfectly

2.) The castle was truely enchanting

3.) Her Father had more depth in the movie than in the animated version

4.) Chip (self explanatory)



Cons: 


1.) I feel like Beast could have resembled the animated version a little more

2.) I didn't care for the explanation as to why they were all cursed with beast, I mean Chip and the dog? Lol 

3.) This is going to sound funny, but did anyone else want the rose to be glowing pink like in the movie? Just me? 

4.) The end fight between the beast and Gaston could have been more epic

In the animated film it was just taken as a given that they loved each other because they were both pure-hearted and kind, but in this version I really bought *why* they would love each other.

I felt the same about the relationship between Belle and Maurice, actually. Seemed like a closer father-daughter relationship than in the animated version.

The biggest disappointment to me was actually the end fight with Gaston, the Beast was just jumping around on the towers and Gaston didn't get to use a bow or a knife, and he could've gone a bit more crazy I guess. I dunno, that just really stuck out to me.

I really enjoyed the film in general and loved the changes that others have complimented. Agree that Emma Watson's acting and singing weren't great but I still loved it.

1) I was confused though- Why did Maurice keep secret from Belle why he took her away from her mother? Surely the truth that she had an incurable and highly contagious disease is better than Belle imagining all the reasons why he could have left her?

2)I enjoyed how much Beast and Belle talk about Shakespeare and the scene where they discuss their favorites. I noticed that given how often it is stated that the villagers and particularly Gaston do not read/ appreciate Shakespeare/ books in general, in the song where they go to kill the Beast, Gaston actually sings 'screw your courage to the sticking post' (a quote from Macbeth). I was wondering what people's thoughts on this were? I'm sure it's in the original song too, I just found it interesting.

I have to say I was especially disappointed with Belle’s ""magic"" jewelry which looked like Hot Topic jewelry, and her dress was also a letdown. 

Also, the fact that Belle never bothered to pick up the dropped music box irked me. It could’ve made for a nice moment later, when she was alone for a bit in the castle, or at least she could've handed it back to her father.

df3vx8y,"I thought it was fantastic. It was more historically accurate than the animated version. They stuck with the 'rule of three,' used in the original tale (e.g., magic book, mirror, and rose). 

I also enjoyed that they offered more of a reason that Belle and the prince would fall in love. In the animated version, it came across as a girl falling for her captor with no reason as to why. In this version, they both shared a tragic history of losing their mothers, and they bonded over those memories. They also added the scene of her reading him a book, showing that they both shared a love of reading. 

They were able to get the lyricist from the animated version to return and write three new songs. The song the prince sang towards the end was fantastic. 

EDIT: They got the same person who did the original score - not the original lyricist. Thanks to another commenter for the correction. ",5zuxzg
df2w7t8,"I really enjoyed the movie. I originally saw Beauty and the Beast in theaters when I was a kid. I was lucky enough to grow up during Disney's animated renaissance, so seeing this was a special experience for me. 

The theater I was in was packed, mostly with moms and their kids. I imagine for the moms, they were there to see something special to them from when they grew up and for the kids it was their chance to really experience the magic of an older, classic Disney movie.

The kids were pretty much laughing at all the points they should laugh at while the rest of us adults dabbed our eyes over the recreated scenes and ending. 

There were a few things I wasn't as impressed with. I appreciate Emma Watson as an actress and she did a good job singing the songs, but it just wasn't on par with the original voice actress. That's okay though. It's not even a negative, just a casual observation. (I also really, really missed Jerry Orbach's singing. RIP.)

They worked really hard to make it clear Gaston was the villain here, too, dang. 

The added scenes were great and added some much needed context to certain scenes and frankly I really enjoyed LeFou's scenes and I hope he found his own prince Charming at the end of the movie too.",5zuxzg
dfhq2gn,"I looooved the animated movie as a kid, in fact I loved all the Disney movies to the point I'd watch them daily. So, coming in I had pretty high expectations. And you know what? They were reasonably met. 

I thought Emma Watson was perfectly serviceable as Belle; although in the more CGI heavy scenes she does look a little lost. My only real complaint re: Emma Watson was the heavy autotune on her voice. Like what the hell? How was that better than any of their other options? Get her a vocal coach and leave her voice natural (with a lil bit of autotune here and there). I'm much more forgiving to weaker voices in movie musicals than trying to hide it. Like these are meant to be real people as well, so it's fine if they're not A+ singers. 

I really loved the reworked songs. It's actually nice having new studio versions with lusher (imo) instrumentation. Be Our Guest is fantastic! Also liked the new songs!

Really loved the supporting cast. I thought Ewan McGregor killed it as Lumiere. His accent was ridiculous but it fits the character. Plus, I've always thought Ewan does a great job in musicals (see: Moulin Rouge). Plus, Audra McDonald, Luke Evans, Josh Gad, Emma Thompson were all very enjoyable. 

Tbh, i found the focussing of the scenes a bit weird... the first time they show the library, why was it not in focus? was that just me??

All in all, I thought it was enjoyable, lighthearted fare. If you're wanting to kill 2 hours with a feel-good romp, I'd recommend it. I'll probably watch it again when it comes out on DVD as well.",5zuxzg

df1qvlk,"The movie was was enjoyable, but for the most part it just made me wish I was watching the cartoon instead.",5zuxzg
df662kz,"It may sound strange, but I thought the directing was really poor. Like the moment when Belle runs out of the village singing about wanting adventure - in the animated one, she runs, spins around, picks a dandelion, lets it flutter in the breeze, and its all very wistful and we understand the imagery. In this one she....stands...and sings. Several other moments like that felt stiff and awkward. ",5zuxzg
df6v2z3,"A lot of positives but a lot of negatives. For positives I'll start with the musical numbers. Be Our Guest, Gaston and Evermore were visually gorgeous and the film is worth watching just for them alone. The songs themselves are also great. The Mob Song may be the only song better than the original but I can't ignore how good the rest are though (except maybe Belle). Gaston is a rip-roaring fun time and Be Our Guest is as magical as before (tempo is a bit off but I'll live). The new songs were hit and miss. The best new one is Evermore which is magnificent and Dan Steven's singing blew me away even under that Tomadachi Life vocal mixing. On the flipside, Days in the Sun did nothing for me. We had Human Again in the original which gets across the same message so why not just do that? 

Acting wise, most people were fine. Kevin Kline and Luke Evans were the stand outs for me though. I never would have guessed Maurice would be my favourite character but Kline's performance is so passionate and engaging that I couldn't wait for more of him. That shot when Gaston and LeFou come into the tavern and see him glaring at them is one of the moments that really stuck with me. Luke Evans' Gaston, while different from the original, is a really nice take. There was this feeling that he wasn't the adored hero he was before and that he knew it. His motivations felt real and Luke Evans does a great job. Dan Stevens is a likeable Beast and the servants are fun as always, especially Ian McKellen's dry comedy as Cogsworth. 

Now for the negatives. The directing. Awful. Two examples come to mind being the reprise of Belle and the ballroom scene. The former in the original had Belle running onto the hill and using her whole body physically to really capture the scale of what she wants and is feeling. The camera doesn't move because she's so animated. Here though, Emma is standing perfectly still, arms awkwardly hanging like she doesn't know what to do with them. As a result, the camera is forced to move so you're not bored.  As for the ballroom scene, I felt nothing. The song was beautifully sung by Emma Thompson but visually, it was bland. Belle and the Beast look so blankly at each other and it almost looks like they don't know what to do except spin. The only reason they did it was because ""it was in the original"" and therefore didn't feel passionate. (Minor note about Emma Watson though. If you need to auto-tune your lead actress in a musical that much, it might just be bad casting. Thank god she wasn't in La La Land.).

One thing that also really bugged me was how sloppy the transition into the climax was. Gaston just suddenly decides to launch the mob out of nowhere. We get the line ""He's not a monster Gaston, you are"" from the original and said almost identically however Gaston doesn't use the word monster preceding it so it seems really forced. Belle used Gaston's words against him in the original but here it was out of nowhere. Then Gaston is suddenly like ""oooh the beast is evil! Look at him, let's kill him!"". One line change that, at the time sounds good, is Belle's response to Beast asking if she's happy with him. The original just has her say ""Yes"" but here she throws out ""Can anyone be happy if they aren't free"". Insightful and challenges the whole Stockholm syndrome thing everyone mocks but as a result her falling for the Beast feels less convincing. They have very good chemistry, just not romantically. When she says ""I love you"" to him at the end, I had to question ""Do you?"". It didn't feel earned. 

Overall I enjoyed it and am definitely getting it on DVD day one but the flaws to stick out to me. It was a ton of fun and I will recommend it but if you're making kids watch it, introduce them to the original first. It's as close to perfect a Disney film can get. I'm thankful for Kevin Kline, Luke Evans and Evermore so I guess it was worth it in the end. ",5zuxzg
df2517u,"Some weird choices and lots of missed opportunities -- could have been great, but so many squandered chances. 

Nice that they went into Belle's backstory, but they missed the chance to tie that story into the rest of the movie and themes. You could cut every scene related to Belle's mother and it wouldn't change a thing.

If they had delved more into the relationship between her parents -- perhaps her mother was dismissive of her father at first as he was just a poor artist, but learned to look beyond her first impressions. Perhaps going into her father's regret that he didn't say something before she died, prompting Belle to speak before it's too late.

As is, the additional scenes don't do *anything* for the film.

I feel like they missed the chance to show La Fou as hopelessly in love with Gaston. 

Gaston's hatred of the Beast was better handled in the original -- you can clearly see it's spurned by romantic jealousy. In the Live Action movie, it's all rather abrupt and sudden (rawr! Look! how scary!). The 2017 makes Gaston into far more of a stupid Villain. They missed a chance to make him an actual complex character -- they could have painted him as an egotistical musclehead who really thinks he's doing the right thing and protecting the town, but drowning in his own prejudices, does the *wrong thing*.

His death was stupid. He just stands there and falls. Compared to the '92, where his own perfidy is what causes his death -- stabbing the Beast in the back leads directly to his falling to his death, vs standing in the wrong place. He could have been standing there applauding and still fallen -- the falling isn't strongly tied to his actions, and detracts from the action->consequence chain.

It bothers me that Belle wasn't a stronger character/participant in the final conflict. The idea of her grabbing a bunch of arrows out of the quiver and snapping them was gobsmackingly stupid. Have you ever tried breaking a chopstick? Not so hard. Now try putting together a bundle of four. Or eight. Yeah, no. Bundles of sticks are really, really hard to break.

It really, really bothers me that in the scene where Gaston points at the crazy homeless woman begging for food, *Belle doesn't go and feed her*. You've got a fucking garden right there, woman.

The emphasis on the Enchantress being a beautiful woman in disguise bothers me. The Prince's sin isn't turning away an ugly person. The Prince's sin is *turning away someone in need*. The emphasis on ""oh but she's really a beautiful person!"" struck me as stupid.

The Enchantress' weird re-entrance at the end was odd and made no sense.

The scene where they kill everyone was disgusting and infuriating. Blatantly gross emotional manipulation for no reason other than to fuck with the audience. Several of the girls in the group were sobbing, so, well, it *worked*, but that doesn't mean it's not deeply stupid. Killing off the characters served literally zero purpose other than to be emotionally abusive towards the audience, and make them think it was a genuinely emotionally engaging film. 

It bothers me that Belle never bothers to ask the Beast what his fucking name is.

If you're going to do a remake, use the original as a rough draft and see how you can improve on it -- the themes and story should be *tighter*, not frazzled and disconnected as fuck like 2017. Tons of wasted opportunities.

Gold filigree floating in the air for no discernible reason other than ""HEY THIS IS WHERE WE SPENT OUR BUDGET FOR THE 3D BULLSHIT"" was distracting to me; my wife didn't notice, but there were a number of scenes with really weird depth-of-field framing that people will probably use to demo 3D glasses in Best Buy.

Does anyone know what the point of Emma Thompson and Kevin Kline eyefucking each other at the end was?

Overall, it was competent at the things it succeeded in. Singing was enjoyable, costumes were gorgeous. It was just disappointing in the way something is when you know it could have been so much more, rather than the disappointment you feel in something that you knew was never going to amount to much.

dfel72x,"Loved the movie.  It obviously could not outdo the original but came a lot closer than expected.

There are plenty of interesting little touches like the villagers' amnesia, Mr. Potts, etc.

Fixed a few plot holes, expanded a few characters, added to Gaston as a propagandistic authoritarian populist. [topical!]

The death scenes were heartbreaking, every one.  In particular the hatrack who used his last moment to save ship.

The music is not quite Menken and Ashman quality but at least Menken and Rice manage sufficient quality to hang with the classics.

However...

I did not like the insertion of the enchantress into the present.  

Originally the enchantress was relatively impersonal and never condoned.  The adaptation treated her as a relatively benevolent being, but she is a sadistic monster, especially since the curse killed the servants in this version.

She rescued Maurice then... never spoke a word in defense when he got accused.  Yes Gaston insulted her but that did not justify her silence.

They addressed the stockholm syndrome meme on Belle but added one worse - ""We made our bed.""  Particularly bizarre to deliver it through Mrs. Potts since her son was inexplicably included.

The movie is beautiful, made me cry, a superior adaptation than expected, but bittersweet for this bizarre sympathy for that enchantress.",5zuxzg

I like that this had more of the stage show to it than the original movie, maybe I'm just saying that because I *played* the Beast in a stage show but still.

df1bwqz,"I'm in the minority here, but as a long time Disney fan and animation fan, this really let me down. More like a 7.3/10, but let me explain.

-The biggest letdown was Emma Watson. She wasn't there in the role. She was way too wooden and disinterested in what she was doing. Her voice was severely auto tuned and grating on the ears. They should've casted an unknown.

-Dan Stevens. He was okay, but they definitely could've casted better. 

-The songs didn't hold up to their original counterparts. The only ones that matched up well was 'Gaston' and 'The Mob Song'.

-Belle's mom's backstory. Was it truly necesarry? It seemed too sad. 

-The 'exclusively gay' moment was 5 seconds and not even worth mentioning. 

-The additions of the new songs were also out of place. Why not use the songs from broadway instead? I get it they want an oscar but the broadway songs are right there. Put their glory to use.

-Audra McDonald only singing twice, and in short bursts. Wtf.

-The. Yellow. Dress. Probably the most iconic Disney dress besides Cinderella's, and you go with that mess. The Disney parks version of the dress is better than what we got in the film. 

-On the plus side, Luke Evans and Josh Gad did wonderful as Gaston and LeFou. Kevin Kline also did well as Maurice. The 'Gaston' sequence felt wonderfully broadway. The ending transformation also gets points for reusing the original music from the animated film, and I really enjoyed seeing the enchanted objects transform into solid objects and back again. They did good for the last 30-40 minutes.

How is he in this movie (in terms of his voice, his look, his song, his acting, his character, etc.)?

Pros:

- Most (If not all) of the cast! I thought everyone did a great job especially Emma Watson and Luke Evans! 

- Most of the musical numbers! I really loved 'Be Our Guest' and how it just kept building and building, 'Gaston' was also fantastic and I think it's better than the original song.

- The cinematography was great and really surprised me how magical the film looked

Cons:

- Some of the CGI *really* badly stood out in some parts, I thought that Lumiere and Cogsworth were almost always perfect but something about the lighting seemed off and they didn't quite blend into the background

- I didn't like Emma Thompson's version of 'Beauty and the Beast' the accent was a bit too much

But if compared to Cinderella, Cinderella felt more, magical. Hard to beat Branagh though.",5zuxzg
df3x6iv,"Okay, so there are now two HUGE plot holes in this thing, thanks to the adaptation changes. 

1) The Beast not only has a magic mirror showing him whatever his heart desires, but now he also has a magic book that can LITERALLY teleport him anywhere, he just doesn't want to since he feels like he won't fit in? Okay, that's a bit extra-OTT from the Enchantress, but I guess it's not that bad. EXCEPT, when Belle needs to rush on back to the village to help Maurice.... she takes the horse, instead of instantly teleporting herself to the village. Furthermore, if she brought that book with her, then she could teleport out of the carriage when she's locked up with her dad, and teleport straight to the castle to help the Beast before Gaston gets to him. It is genuinely shocking how lazy the writing was for that whole book business, it's like they wanted to give us a new scene of Belle and Beast bonding over past tragedies, but to do it, they came up with a completely game-breaking plot device that never gets brought up again after it serves it's purpose for that one scene. Maddening.

2) When Maurice is calling out Gaston for trying to kill him, and he suggests that the beggar woman could vouche for him, Gaston dismisses her as a 'hag' or somesuch. Now, after the movie, we realize this was the Enchantress (who for whatever bizarre reason is still sticking around the village, as if she enjoys watching the results of her curse on the people's memories making them a bunch of ignorant lunatics), but if this is the woman that got so offended by the Prince not letting her stay in his castle on a cold winter's night, that she would cast this ridiculously over the top curse, why doesn't she fly off the handle at Gaston's disrespect? Hell, why doesn't she actually vouche for Maurice? Or turn into her Enchantress form and prove his story? ANYTHING but what she did. Either this is yet more asinine writing, or the Enchantress is an utterly vile person, which makes her sudden change of heart and undoing of the curse at the end completely baffling. ",5zuxzg
df4dai4,"The production design and the costumes are absolutely gorgeous. The castle looked amazing, and I thought the extravagance of it was perfect. It was like something out of Versailles. I wasn't sure about Belle's iconic yellow dress from the released images, but it's much better on-screen. 

Also, I love the changes they made to the curse and introducing the Beast's backstory. Particularly [how it shows the Beast getting cursed as an adult, giving an extravagant ball (and that makeup work on him was stunning, it reminded me of the extravagance of Louis XIV). Also, it was nice that they cut out the ""must find love before his 21st year"" and how they changed the lyric in Be Our Guest from ""10 years we've been rusting"" to ""So long, we've been rusting"" or something like that. I though that was really smart. Giving the Beast a reason for his selfishness was great as well, and the fact that he can actually read. Like, he's a freaking prince. Of course he can read.](#spoiler) Those details just really fixed the plot holes and slight ridiculousness from the animated version.

Okay. I probably have seen it, but have terrible memory and ADD ever since I was a child and remember close to nothing from the original version.

As a note, I still have no desire to watch the animated film after this. And I figured I would. But I don't. This version was perfect. The music, the visuals, the chemistry between all the characters. Maurice was my favorite. His first appearance on screen made me want to cry even though I had no idea what was coming. He was just the perfect envisionment of a sweet Disney father/old man. For some reason it made me want to cry.

The beast looked amazing. The CGI wasn't too cheesy. And somehow he still looked attractive even in beast form. It's understandable that Emma Watson was able to fall in love with him.

And not about to leave out my favorite part. Belle and her prince looked perfect together at the end. I actually envied Emma Watson for her romantic interest instead of the other way around for once. That actor is sexy as fuck. And at the end where she asks him if he'd consider growing a beard and he growls at her... holy shit. Should have given me a NSFW warning before my pantries got wet.

Overall it was fantastic, and I can't wait to see the rest of the live action Disney films yet to come, hopefully the next ones will take after the originals as much as this one did. That's honestly what makes these Disney movies different from any other adaptation of the stories. 

Honestly confused by the tone of the movie though. Can't tell if it was for children or adults? I probably wouldn't have liked it as a kid, but as a 20-something who grew up with classic Disney, this is fan service done right. No complaints on my end. ",5zuxzg
df7wz6p,"Beauty and the Beast was an absolutely amazing movie. Loved absolutely everything about it. I also thought of a theory. Everyone has been asking why the enchantress didn't curse Gaston? It's my theory that she did. So we all know the enchantress cursed the beast. But why is she still in the town? Maurice is riding to a town, past the path to the castle that is normally impossible to find. But lightning coincidentally (or magically) forces him to go to the castle. Coincidentally (or magically) the horse found its way back through an entire forest and then back again to the castle with Belle. The enchantress knew Maurice is so protective the he would never let Belle into the woods. So the enchantress lured her to the castle with Maurice as bait because now he couldn't stop her. Hence Belle was always meant to find and fall in love with the beast. Which brings me to Gaston's curse. Belle was meant to love the beast and Gaston was cursed with loving the one thing he could not have, that would either lead him to change or die. That's it. That's the limit of my brain power.

I feel like moment-to-moment, the original was better directed. The director had better discipline of framing and blocking and camera movement. The new director struggles to direct an action scene. The CGI was sub par, especially compared to The Jungle Book, last year. Compare the wolves of the two films. 

Another thing that bothered me was this one felt like they watched an Honest Trailer and were too self aware about nitpicks from the original. Yes yes, there's a castle within walking distance from the town, the weather doesn't make sense, the enchantress was really cruel, where's Belles mom? Doesnt Le Fou seem kinda gay for gaston?? Well if you were that annoying ass that needed that stuff fixed by an authorial hand, here's a cover version of the movie, just for you. 

On the positive side, i liked the characterization of the beast. He was less outright manipulative, even if he was less beastly starting out. The village side of things flows a bit better, and Gaston is more interesting as well. 

Overall, a pleasant, hammy experience that plays hard for nostalgia points at the expense of being mediocre. It doesn't do itself any favors by demanding comparisons to its overall superior predecessor. ",5zuxzg
df4eacr,"For some reason, when I left the movie I felt very ambivalent to the movie. At the same time, tt was good and I thought they cast was well chosen. I was withholding my opinion on Emma Watson's rendition of the Belle, her voice was something that I was worried about. When I was listening to the audio it felt like everyone was falling flat and couldn't pull it off, but I was pleasantly surprised in the movie. It was much better to hear it in a theater and watch the movement of the characters. 

There was obviously a lot of care being placed with the live action, they stayed true to Belle's characteristics and the addition of some songs was great. If I didn't know better I would say that the new songs were in the original movie, they were taken from the Broadway though so it has the olden day Disney vibes. They easily fit into the story with no problem. 

Whoever was in charge of the wardrobe did an amazing job, the outfits were beautiful a and stayed true to the time line. Watching Belle dance with the Beast took my breath away, just like the first time I watched the movie. There were scenes that I felt were odd, like how the Enchantress was introduced. I preferred the original movie's choice of entrance for her, it felt more fairytale and realistic? In the live action it's like she decided to trespass into a castle. 

I do suggest people watch it because it was quite nice to see on a huge screen. Also, live actions musicals are only brought to the big screen once in awhile so take the chance!

He should have apologized to Maurice in the scene where the townspeople reunite with the castle inhabitants. it wasn't Le Fou's idea but he still did Maurice wrong. In fact, LeFou belongs in jail for aiding Gaston in attempted murder. 

Also, how awkward is it that the townspeople tried to murder everybody and burn their castle down? Yet everybody is all sweet and happy with the townspeople at the end. What happened to the people that Mrs. Potts gave third degree burns to?

But despite his lack of biceps to spare, Gaston is incredibly cast... probably the only one perfectly casted in the whole film. The story picked up when  it started introducing original elements like the first time we meet Maurice. The highlight for me would be the Beast's original song - that was beautiful.

Nothing new offered in the film got me excited all that much, though I can sympathize with why they changed the film a bit.

All in all, the film was only as good as a motivation for me to go watch the original film.  ",5zuxzg
df6g1yd,"I thought it was absolutely magical. Be Our Guest was the scene I anticipated most and I thought they knocked it out of the park (maybe even hinting at their next live action reboot?). 

I thought the additions about Belle and Maurice's past were fine, maybe not fully necessary but still worked. 

I did catch one glaring continuity error:
[Belle's mother had the plague, setting the story in the mid-14th century. However Belle is surprised that the Beast knows Shakespeare. I would be surprised too, he wasn't born for like 200 years] (#spoiler)",5zuxzg
df1wwoj,"For all the upgrades they made, I was upset about the timeline still. 

So, we're believed to think that Belle was kept in the castle for about a week? Gaston said he was looking for Maurice for about 5 days after abandoning him in the forest (which, on a tangent, I also didn't like them making Gaston a casual murderer), where Maurice had basically just left the castle. We know the castle is within a day's travel of the town since Belle remarked to her father that she'd see him the next day when he left for the market. It made more sense too that there was an ""eternal winter"" around the castle which explained the snowball scene. 

In a week, are we to believe that they still fell in love? I don't know, it still felt a little cheap to me - though I am willing to forgive it for the fairytale but I feel like they could have extended the timeline to make their falling in love a little more realistic.",5zuxzg
df3jqy7,"""A broken clock is right 2 times a day. This is not one of those times."" Is such a genius line.

Also, she and Dan Stevens were heavily autotuned and it really stuck out to me, especially when people who have these booming voices (Luke Evans) are put next to them. I think Dan Stevens could have handled himself without the autotune because he has a lot of musical theatre experience. Emma Watson, however, seems to have brought nothing to the table but her name.

df3wjlw,"I thought this movie was one of the most beautifully made period pieces I have seen. I was a little old for the cartoon when it came out, so I had seen the movie once years ago but had no expectations. I loved watching this movie today, I cannot say enough about the costumes and sets, just stunning, and completely captivating in and of themselves. The story does not venture far from the original, so it is sweet and lovely.  There are several tear jerking or goose bump moments, when belle and the beast visit her childhood attic, when belle puts on the yellow dress and the dance with the beast is just beyond anything you can imagine, and when their love is too late the last petal falls and all of the castle characters are saying goodbye and ""dying"" it is so sad!

Emma as Belle did fall a bit flat in some scenes, it just felt like I was watching Hermione dance and interact with a Beast. Some of her scenes which I can't remember in particular did stand out but she did have a few. Luke was great as Gaston, and I enjoyed the few small changes they made (more backstory to Belle's mom and Beast's parents as well).

Aside of Lumier nobody really felt like their animated counter part I didn't get Beast or Belle from either actor more so Gaston . Obviously the production value is gonna be amazing it's Disney of course but besides that I think it failed to capture any of the magic the animated film instilled in me and I'm not coming from  a blinded nostalgic point of view as some people I'm just not fond of these live action films basically just reselling the same movie with lesser of a value . The music this time around was meh , cinematography was good at some parts but not at all consistent they only really cared on the big scenes , the CGI was choppy and I think they just had too much going on at once in the musical numbers to really pay attention to anything . Sadly there's still Mulan , Lion King and Pocahontas still to come .  ",5zuxzg
df9kv14,"I thought this movie was charming enough and fairly moving, but a couple of the design choices really irked me. Like it was so weird how the Beast's lil canine teeth kept appearing and disappearing - featuring them very plainly as part of his whole look was one choice, but then to not be consistent with it? I don't really get how nobody would've noticed that.

Also the 'Plumette' character - i feel like her design was PROBably based on actual feather dusters from the time period, and the production team just thought 'welp these old things had decorative wings, she should fly around'. But I felt it made many scenes w the servants (who were all p adorable) unbelievable. Like i know this is a movie about beastiality and magical candles, but I needed the characters to be grounded in reality amidst all the CG, and that design choice felt odd.",5zuxzg
dfxlxo9,"Just saw this this evening. I absolutely loved it! The music was brilliant: Evermore made me cry and Gaston was my favourite scene in the entire movie. I also really liked Days in the sun and Be our guest was absolutely spectacular. Much preferred Audra McDonald's version of Beauty and the Beast at the end of the movie to Emma Thompson's though.

 The acting was so blooming great: Luke Evans and Josh Gad were fantastic as well as Dan Stevens. I actually couldn't fault Emma. There were a few hiccups with her acting but apart from those she was good. Ewan Mcgregor really did Lumiere amazingly. He was so charming and his accent wasn't that bad. Ian McKellen was as usual brilliant.

The cinematography absolutely blew my mind. From the castle to the forest and everything. The be our guest scene was absolutely fantastic. I was sitting there open mouthed throughout the whole scene. 

All in all it was perfect in my eyes and I can't wait to see it again. ",5zuxzg

df5gcj7,"I adored it. My favorite movie of 2017 so far and I've seen it twice. Upon first viewing, I felt a bit iffy about the added parts (evermore, the mother) since I love the original so much, but after a second viewing, I love how it made the story feel a bit more complete. Wayyyy better than maleficent and Cinderella, which I was so bored by. 

I would give it probably a 95%

The only changes I would make:

1. Add a bit more to how their relationship grows since that part of the movie (both animated and live action) seems too fast. Though this movie did improve on that, it could've added more

2. Belle wouldn't remember Paris if she left as an infant, so why is she always talking about it like it was her childhood? A minor change would just have made belle a toddler when she left...

3. One thing the animated version does better is show the dozens and dozens, even hundreds, of cursed servants. Basically all the furniture, dishes, a lot of art... all of it is cursed.  But in this version, you'd think the only cursed humans are lumiere, plumette, mme garderobe, the piano, and cogsworth. It lessens how massive the curse is and how many lives it impacted. ",5zuxzg
df5h972,"I really enjoyed it! I would definitely say its better than Cinderella. I was definitely most impressed with the music. They nailed the musical numbers. The Beast CGI could have been better as others have stated. Emma Watson was good, and her performance got better throughout the movie. The script suffers between the musical numbers towards the beginning, but really picks up at the end. I really didn't expect to care so much for the servants at the end!",5zuxzg
dff7pkt,"I was five when the original movie came out, and even as a little girl I knew to ask when a live action version would come out. When the musical went on its national U.S. tour, my mom took me to see it in Los Angeles. I bought the double pack of the full soundtrack, memorized ""Home"" and fell in love with ""Me"" and ""Human Again"" and especially ""If I Can't Love Her"". 

So, I guess what I have to say is, what a lost opportunity not to submit to the pacing of the musical and go full throttle with the brilliant pieces from the show. I know that Menken himself composed most of the new stuff, but I'm saddened that a vague overture of ""Home"" is all we get from that beautiful stage score.

I'll offer one generosity to the production of this current film in terms of new songs: I'm grateful that they used the opportunity to write pieces that frame the characters sympathetically to our 2017 ears.

A few other random notes:

- TIL that plague doctors were totally still a thing in pre-revolutionary France

- what a brilliant rewrite in ""Be Our Guest,"" changing the lyric from ""ten years we've been rusting"" to ""for years,"" fixing literally decades of speculation about the weird timeline

- Anyone else hung up on the Sweeney Todd-ness of the enchantress reveal?

- And speaking of the enchantress, anyone else hung up on the pervasive weirdness and unfairness of her spell? Why are we not concerned that she's still out there? If they're so freaked out about dark magic...

- Are we supposed to presume that Maurice escaped the castle on foot?! In other words, poor Phillips goes back and forth a dozen times, but he's for sure waiting down below when Belle leaves the castle the first time. So, did Maurice just run?

- I had a lot of sympathy for our librarian friend. Wanted him to wind up curating the library in the castle or otherwise with some appreciation/companionship. 

- What is with the weird knowing glance between Emma Thompson and Kevin Kline at the end?

- Did anyone else catch Maurice tinkering with a model of Agraba?

- Whyyyyy with the accents whyyyy? 

Disney Producer 1: Our actors sound crappy next to Audra MacDonald.

The first act definitely has some rough parts in it. Emma was I dunno, awkward? Plus her acting was a bit robotic—you can tell her director says to her, ""Okay, now act surprised! Now act scared!"" etc. 

While I do stand by my initial impressions re: Little Town (it was butchered), I feel the film did find its bearings around Be Our Guest—and still managed to end on quite a high. The 6-7 rating on IMDB seems about right. ",5zuxzg

I wasn't against the whole LouFu being gay thing but i just felt like it wasn't really needed. The extra songs that weren't in the animated i just wasn't feeling.

df8nj5e,"Lots of hit and miss with the added portions, but in general I admired their very clear want to fix up some of the more popular plot holes. And a nice reference to the Broadway Play with the servants gradually becoming more furniture-like.

Gaston and LeFou were the stars of the movie, easily. I also liked how ornate everything was (Although it made a lot of the servants look really odd). Props to production design.

Was anyone else bothered by how quick the pans were? Like holy hell I couldn't see anything they were so blurry. When Belle gets to the Library and they do the quintessential panning shot I'm like...what am I looking at? What should have been one of the most stunning setpieces was incomprehensible.

Overall...7/10 ish. Not memorable, but a welcome tribute to the original.

df4t88x,"This was a great film. The set design and artistic direction were superb.

However, I'm starting to get this weird vibe from all of Disney's content these days. I don't know what else to call it but ""over-produced.""

Disney movies these days are *so* over-the-top, and *so* streamlined and market-perfect that they transform from a dramatic piece into an expensive, surreal mess. Not that I wasn't touched and very amused at many times. It's not like this made it a bad film for me, but I just didn't have a moment when I could forget about the pretense of what I was watching and appreciate it in it's own right. The whole movie screams ""*this is the Beauty and the Beast remake, and we know it!""*

Besides that oddly metaphysical misgiving, this film was funnier, more ambitious, more dramatic, and just all-around more intricately designed than the last one. My one other complaint is the ham-handed way they seemed to be handling progressive ideals in the movie. But why should I be complaining about accuracy to 15th century French culture when there's talking furniture?",5zuxzg
dfbzkm1,"I didn't really go into this movie with any expectations. Beauty and the Beast has been my favorite Disney movie since I was a baby. (Seriously my dad says I watched it everyday) However, during the opening scene and the first song of the movie I felt like I was watching a parody of the movie rather than a remake. It just felt goofy and...off. Other odds and ends that stood out to me:

* Emma Watson's portrayal of Belle felt bored and stiff. Almost like she wasn't really interested in what she was saying. She also seemed to switch between two expressions and that's about all we saw. 

* The first half of the movie I felt like we barely saw Belle or the Beast. They felt surprisingly absent and then all of a sudden they are falling in love. 

* Lumiére's ""French"" accent was terrible. Belle was also speaking with a British accent, which doesn't make sense considering she was born in Paris and raised in France. Hearing so many British accents in a French castle felt out of place. I watched this movie in Paris though, so I may be overcritical, but my French fiancé has the same opinion. 

* Luke Evans as Gaston was ""meh"". He didn't seem as dumb or as handsome/buff as Gaston is supposed to be. He just seemed too...old to me. 

Some positives:

* Lefou and Maurice were cast very well. I enjoyed their characters and actually liked this Maurice more than the animated one. 

* Be Our Guest, Tale as Old as Time, and the mob song as they storm the castle sounded amazing. These songs made it worth seeing the movie. 

* The ending scene with the servants is fantastic and brings out all the emotions the rest of the movie was lacking. 

* The beast's voice was *almost* perfect. 

Overall the movie was ok. It's definitely rewatchable and I did shed a tear at the end. For me the second half of the movie was the best by far.

dfhpur1,"Has anyone else seen it in both 3D and regular old 2D?  

My husband and I were WAY more impressed by the 2D. We actually saw it again when we found out it was converted, because we'd been really confused about why everyone thought it was so visually impressive.  The 3D made the backgrounds seem dark and blurred, and we were both getting flashbacks to *The Hobbit*--nothing seemed real.  We're both so glad we went back to see it in 2D--it felt like a completely different movie. ",5zuxzg

df52xix,I must have been the only person here that actually liked the casting including Emma Watson. ,5zuxzg
df3av65,"Just came back from watching this, and I immensely enjoyed it. Much more so than I expected given the fact that it's based on an animated Disney property with song and dance -- not really a big fan of those. That said, I'm one of the heretics who has never seen the original animated film, so I can't judge if this adaptation is faithful to it or not.

I admit that I pretty much watched the film because of Emma Watson, and I thought she was great. I liked that she played Belle pretty hands-on and assertive, and that her role lacked any dumb damsel-in-distress moments. Singing is not really her forté, but she still did an admirable job. Too bad her singing voice was apparently tampered with a bit too much in post. It sometimes sounded strange.

The other actors were also all great, my favorites were probably Ewan McGregor as Lumiere and Dan Stevens as the Beast. I also liked that all the main characters hit pretty much a sweet spot regarding their background stories. They were explained succinctly enough as to not bog down the main story.

That's another thing the film did really well: it had a good flow. There weren't any scenes or developments that overstayed their welcome, but I also never felt that the film was rushed.

There were a few things that bothered me a bit: 1. In some scenes there was too much going on in the frame -- the ""Be Our Guest"" scene was particularly bad in this regard, and did a huge disservice to Emma Watson because her interaction was so limited due to the CGI onslaught. I really wish the filmmakers would've restrained themselves a bit here. 2. The interaction of actors with CGI (characters) was sometimes not convincing. Some (especially daylight) shots of Emma Watson interacting with the Beast looked off. 3. Some shots lacked in scope and felt very small.

But at the end those are minor quibbles. The film made me tear up in all the right places and really was much more than the sum of its parts. If Disney can conjure up films of this caliber for its other animation adaptations, I'm in.",5zuxzg
df3blm8,"So I didn't think it was as bad as some were saying. While I agree that Watsons singing isn't the greatest I think that it added a certain charm in it like Emma stones in la la land. The audience I was with seemed to like it also , got claps at the end of the movie that I usually only see for Star Wars . Surprising I Got goosebumps at certain times in the movie that I wasn't expecting. ",5zuxzg
df3oqf9,"Me and my wife just came back from the movie - and while the original version was one of the best animations ever (for me at least), we don't know why but for both of us this live action version was everything we were hoping for except the leading roles - Belle and the Beast felt flat: I didn't like EW that much, she just wasn't the portrayal of the original Belle for us - we felt like she was a little of Bella (no pun intended, really) from Twilight - pretty much same face across the entire movie, not many emotions... As for the Beast - he really was more like a puppet than a living character - how he walked, how he behaved - to stiff, without a soul - We compared it with the orcs from Warcraft movie, and as bad as that movie was, those orcs were truly alive! What managed to impress me in the original was the face of the Beast - and how it can change from being angry/evil/scary to calm/funny/good - and the scene where he grabs up Gaston on top of the castle roof, keeping him in the air to drop him - he is angry as hell, Belle yells at him and he just melts away, with rain drops running across his face - unforgettable! Now it was flat, no change, nothing, It was disappointing as hell! Also the Beast walked funny, in a rigid uncomfortable way...

Also what I disliked that much to worth mentioning - the inclusion of the enchantress - and the fact that she ""cheated"" for our characters to get together - doing so making all the magic between Belle and the Beast, well, less magic... Also I really wanted to see an updated version of the stained glass from the start of the original - again something that really impressed me in the past and I needed a refresh!

Now moving to some positives - we really loved the songs (I got really excited to hear some old songs) - the effects, the atmosphere, Gaston was a great portrayal of the original!

We give it a 7... A great movie, with awesome characters, songs and effects...but with flat leading characters.",5zuxzg
dfdj5gp,"Just saw it today so i'll go through 5 things I liked and 5 things I didn't like

Liked

1. I loved the song by beast that was done by Josh Groban in the credits. I thought it was pretty good and summed up his feelings and that he hoped she'd return

2. The casting with the furniture was quite good. Especially Ewan McGregor.  I thought they seemed like they had fun with it.

3. I liked  LeFou. He kind of reminded me of how the simpsons used to portray Smithers. I don't know why they needed to have a press conference about it, but honestly I thought LeFou was fun

4. I liked how they added the plot point about how those in the village forgot about their loved ones in the castle and vice versa. I thought it was a nice touch

5. I thought that it was good that Gaston wasn't a dumb hulk, but was kind of smart yet full of himself. Sure he wasn't as handsome as the cartoon but I think it worked. He thought he was hot stuff and that's what made him such a jerk, but also endearing to the townsfolk


Dislikes

1.  For some reason I didn't like the opening sequence because it other than liking to party and being too decadent he didn't seem like much of a dick other than to the old woman. Also i'm just not a big fan of that decadent french style

2. I felt like Emma Watson wasn't bad but was basically just kind of there. Not that she didn't care or anything but it was just like they had her in there to get fangirls and fanboys in the seats. 

3. I didn't get the whole idea of it being winter always yet June. The cartoon didn't have this iirc. Granted that might have been spoiled by the Direct to video christmas movie where it seemed like Belle was there for a year or so.

4. I felt like the beasts voice couldn't quite stay the same. Its like they couldn't decide whether they wanted Dan Steven's actual voice or just the typical growley voice. It seemed odd

5. I felt like beast also seemed a little meaner. The cartoon version reminded me more of a guy who'd still protect belle, but was just mean. This beast seemed more like a spoiled brat at first. ",5zuxzg
df2fdcs,"I don't know about you guys, but I was left thinking ""What was the bloody point?"" and came out feeling underwhelmed as everything felt weaker in comparison to the 1991 original. Emma Watson is not very good, and they didn't change enough to make it stand out compared to The Jungle Book or Pete's Dragon remakes. 4.5/10",5zuxzg
df1fkzm,[deleted],5zuxzg
dfeywdg,"This movie felt fake and forced. Like most Disney these days... But even the new Cinderella they made had more life to it, and added something more to the story by going back to the fairytale's original roots. With this one it was like all the actors were put in little boxes, made to be live-action replicas of the animated characters. Why? We've already seen that. So much cringy writing too... And the autotune! Ahhhhh my ears are bleeding just thinking of it. All in all I suppose it wasn't the worst thing I've seen. Just so sad they didn't take advantage of the many opportunities they had to make it even better. What a shame.",5zuxzg
df19r0i,"For the people who saw it, how was the CGI on the Beast for most of the movie? Distracting or realistic?",5zuxzg
df1ag83,"Went in with very few expectations and absolutely loved it. I've been listening to the new soundtrack recordings all week and I think the processing on Emma's voice was a lot less noticeable in the film. Acting wise I thought she was a bit flat at the beginning but really liked her performance by the end. And she looked stunning throughout! The big songs were all bloody brilliant - I had the biggest grin on my face all through Be Our Guest. I think Ewan McGregor absolutely killed it and made it his own. Some of the new(?) song additions were a little bit hit and miss but by the end of Evermore I loved that song and Dan Stevens voice/performance. One of my slight issues with the film was some of the editing and shots they used, particularly some of the ending scenes (transformation + very last song/dance) but I don't know how much of that is just from having the original animation in my head.
Overall, bloody loved it and can't wait to see it again. I'm going to have the songs in my head for weeks - again! 9/10",5zuxzg
df2gquy,"I liked it. Reminded me of Cinderella. Pretty simple and straight forward but it has a likable charm to it. Emma Watson was hit of miss, great in some scenes and awkward in some but didn't ruin the movie for me by any means. ",5zuxzg
df2hgn8,Did you see Belle feeling the Beasts head as if she was assessing for a fever lol ,5zuxzg
df4ctcz,"Absolutely loved it, held up well to the original, which is my favorite Disney movie. This film had the magic of the original while still managing to tell the tale in a fresh, unique way. I wasn't expecting Luke Evans to be as brilliant as he was being Gaston, so that was a pleasant surprise. This Belle preserved the original while still being unique to Emma Watson, who was incredible, you could tell she was into the role. 

I also enjoyed the small plot additions that answered questions that were left a mystery in the original, due to it being simply a Disney movie with no need to get complicated. I've always wondered why nobody noticed their friends that worked in the castle, not to mention their ruler himself, suddenly disappeared. An explanation for the Beast being an asshole really humanized the character. All in all a wonderful experience, it was my favorite this year so far, along with Logan.",5zuxzg
dfct9xz,"I enjoyed this movie a lot. It brought back so many memories...my favorite part was the ""Gaston"" song, I thought it was extremely well done. I also liked the Beast's new song. 

I didn't think that the additional backstory (Belle's mom, Beast's dad) really added a ton, though. It also failed to explain why the enchantress gave the servants in the castle an even *worse* punishment than the Beast. That was something that always bugged me after I first saw the 1991 version.

",5zuxzg
dfdpr9r,"Just saw this a few minutes ago, it was amazing! I thought the original cartoon was alright but I really enjoyed this version. The effects were done extremely well and the acting was good while still having a fairy tale feel to it. I don't understand a lot of the dislike for this movie, I would highly recommend it.",5zuxzg
df4xu9f,There's more black people in this movie than all of alsace in the 18th century.,5zuxzg
df3rs4x,"I saw Beauty and the Beast last night with some friends. I felt as if someone has poured a bottle of magic over my head that, just like glitter, I'm unable to get off of me ever since. Disney of late seems incapable of putting out a big movie lately that doesn't manage to completely enthrall. I'm seeing a lot of criticism of Emma Watson's not portraying the original Belle closely enough, and of not being able to sing.

First, let me say that those who ""cannot sing"" can still make beautiful music. I don't know if Emma Watson can sing (I haven't seen any proof that she can't), but the music is very beautiful and I don't understand how digital tools being used to help her sound better has anything to do with the quality of the end-music. I'm sure they use digital tools to make everyone in the movie sound better, yet Emma Watson has been singled out for this criticism. None of the male talent has this problem. Truly mind-boggling (sexism still alive and well in our day?)

In my mind, it is a critical fallacy to judge a remake such as this by how well it imitates the original. A remake can and should break with the original to reflect the society of today. In the original film, Belle resigned herself to eternal imprisonment, spent much of the early movie sobbing in a heap, and had to be rescued by Chip at the end.

In this new film, she shows character and a backbone from the beginning, [immediately makes plans for escape from the castle without needing to collapse in a sobbing heap, and (together with her father) is able to engineer her own escape from the wagon at the end.](#spoiler)

There is much criticism that Disney feels the need to remake these classics, but I feel it is necessary to do so, so that girls growing up now are presented with more worthy models to learn from.

And regarding the gay moment, for which Malaysia has banned the movie and Russia has essentially issued it an R rating... Let's stop thinking that Hollywood is pushing some sort of agenda by acknowledging that there are gays. They spend all of 10 seconds on this ""agenda"" in the movie. If children learn that gays exist (which they will anyway) and scenes like this can make gays feel less stifled by society's disapproving gaze, then I don't see the harm done. Your religion is not being infringed upon. Your ""religious freedom"" does not entitle you to demand that gays remain unseen and unheard. It does entitle you to not come out as a gay, and to respectfully discuss why you feel it is wrong based on religious principles, but that is the extent of your privileges.

Disney can, and will, continue to reflect the times in their movies. Other artists, writers and producers will do the same in children's movies and shows in the future. And we are becoming a more tolerant and inclusive society in spite of the kicking and screaming done by some conservative groups.",5zuxzg
df1ist0,"Disney paid over 100 million dollars more than what the original cost for what amounts to a poor man's version of their classic.

df1a1k0,[deleted],5zuxzg
df1bheu,"I loved it. Any kind of ""small issue"" I noticed doesn't take away from the beauty of the movie or how close it stayed to the classic story. Beast looked amazing, his new song in my opinion will be an Oscar Nomination. I love the whole cast. And what the heck with the end where they turn back into antiques!! That was gut wrenching. Just left and am sitting at Applebee's eating boneless wings and just want to go straight back when I'm done to see it again. ",5zuxzg
df2y8or,"I liked it. It was almost a scene-for-scene retelling of the animated film, but it was mostly well-cast, and the production design is stunning. Luke Evans and Josh Gad absolutely hit it out of the park. The ""Be Our Guest"" was as visually sumptuous as you'd want it to be. There is no reason why the ""LGBT part"" should be mentioned as often as it is. 

At the end of the day, there's no reason for this movie to exist. But I'm glad that it does. ",5zuxzg
df4alog,"I really liked the visuals, I thought the production was top notch, but the movie just didn't sit that right with me. 

I think it was because everything just seemed so...disjointed? Many scenes, such as ones with the Enchantress, the ones were Belle asks Maurice about her mother, when Belle and the Beast teleport to Paris (???), they just came out of nowhere and I feel like didn't add anything to the plot.

They should have just stuck with the original 100% and kept the plot as simple as possible. The Enchantress and the sidestory with Belle's mother were certainly not needed.",5zuxzg
df1phsh,"It had its charms.  I don't know, I don't feel like it justified its existence the way the new Cinderella did.  That felt like a re-evaluation of the old material whereas this just felt like a straight adaptation.  Maybe I liked that more because I hate the original Cinderella and I love the original Beauty and the Beast, so I'm a bit hard on the new one.  

I love Emma Watson but something about her wasn't working for me.  Her singing was autotuned at certain parts right?  It fell a little flat at times.  The Beast was pretty awesome, admittedly.  
 
The musical numbers were too busy, if that makes sense?  Maybe they look cooler in 3D?  Honestly, the thought of watching it in 3D makes me feel sick.  

Overall the movie wasn't *bad*.  It's actually a fine production, but it just didn't gel right for me.  I don't know if it's fair to fault it just because the animated version exists.  I mean, at this point, the original is like 25 years old, so a remake is appropriate, but I had a hard time getting over it.  

A few friends and I made our own version of Beauty and the Beast last year, changing up the plot in lots of different ways.  So if you want to watch a really, really low quality of the story:

df38flo,"Im going to come off as a jerk, but I didn't like this movie. Emma was bad as Belle in my opinion. She can't sing which is one thing, but she doesn't bring in the personality to carry it. She just reads her lines. In fact, a majority of this film just feels like them hitting the stones of the original without bringing in the personality of the original or anything new to it either.

df3anny,"Personally, I was disappointed by Emma Thompson's (Mrs. Potts) singing. I felt like Audra McDonald (Madame Garderobe), should have been cast as Potts [at the end during the dancing when Mcdonald sang Beauty and the Beast, it was so much better than Thompson's version from earlier](#spoiler)
I also wasn't a fan of Belle's town outfits, not sure what was up with that bizarre ""tuck your dress into your waistband and show pantaloons thing"". It honestly looked like she was wearing a dress over short pj pants and boots that reminded me a bit of combat boots.

This Lumiere couldn't hold a candle to the original, but Jerry Orbach is a hard act to follow.

The new songs were ok, I did like the Beast's number (I never knew that Dan Stevens could sing that well), but I feel like they added so many so they'd have a chance at the ""best original song"" category. I was disappointed that they played the melody of ""Home"" from the Broadway version, but didn't have it sung in the film, though I guess I somewhat understand it as A: the lyrics don't seem to fit this version of Belle as much [she didn't seem to be as fond of her home as she did in the B'way one](#spoiler) and B: Emma Watson couldn't have done the song justice.",5zuxzg
df3fzta,"I thought it was good, not as good as the original but good. Overall this movie is an 8.1/10 for me. Where as the original was around an 8.7/10. I think it should be considered for an Oscar nomination for Production Design, Costume Design, and Best Original Song (Evermore by Dan Stevens). Some things I like:

1. I loved all the back stories they gave us. Especially the Beast back story, and the reason the servants are so loyal too him.

2. I loved a lot of the fixing of plot holes that the original had. Also the slight changes they made too were great.

3. Obviously if I think it should be cosidered for an Oscar nomination, I loved the song Evermore by Dan Stevens.

Some things I didn't like:

1. I didn't like Be Our Guest, and most of the other original songs(The Mob Song & Belle were fine). I feel like they needed to get some one with a real French accent to play Lumiere. Love Ewan just didn't like him in this.

2. I didn't like that LaFou helped the cabinetry fight, and went against Gaston. Like I know they were hinting at it because Gaston continued to not listen to him and was totally willing to throw him in the looney bin. I just liked him as the clingy, loyal possibly gay henchmen from the original. But other then that LaFou I was completely fine with, Josh Gad did a great job.

3. I didn't like the Enchanted Book. Belle is a girl that wants to see the world, that's why she likes books so much, because they bring her to a different world. She now has a chance to go anywhere she would like and she goes to place she's already been. Also didn't understand why Maurice couldn't say that to his daughter, I get it may be painful but he did the right thing in the end.

Last small thing why didn't they give the beast a name, they made all the other little corrections from the original besides this one. Why does the beast never say oh by the way my name is Todd, so you can stop referring me as Beast, he, him, or it.   ",5zuxzg

Dan Stevens was a bit of a letdown as the prince reveal imo. ,5zuxzg
df5w9bt,"Saw this movie on its opening here in the rainy Singapore. I thought it was a contemporary take on old-time classic and it's an amazing feat to keep a Disney fan like me vested through the whole movie. 

I found myself singing along (to the annoyance of my surrounding kids, I am sure) to the old songs, and was so excited about the new songs! Even the old songs have been given an updated arrangements to reflect the tastes of our time.

The only disappointment I could think of was that I found several iconic scenes in the movie let down by lighting. In the animated series, the spectacle of the kitchenware dance in 'be my guest' and the dazzling hall where Mrs Potts sang 'beauty and the beast' were remarkable but were significantly dimmer and realistic in the live action film.

Movies like this should reflect out current climate, rather than the one they are depicting, same with the ""gayness."" However, there are some things I won't forgive. First of all, Bell seems to be completely unaffected by the cold, she seems to bo outside in a short sleeved dress without showing any signs of being cold. Also, they don't have any breath fog. Another thing, when Maurice arrives to the castle there is water and hay gor Phillipe. why? Phillipe is a whole bunch of confusion. Maurice takes him back to the village, and yet Phillipe is magically back at the castle. One of the biggest things was one little line. So it's referenced several times to be the middle of June, but when Gaston, Maurice, and Lafou are looking for the Beast Gaston lists frostbite as a real threat. What? I thought it was the middle of June? [When gaston loses his gun in the snow it shouldn't work, wet powder. There were also no plague outbreaks during that time, so while its possible Belle's mom died from plague her and Maurice should've been quarantined as well.  Lastly I'm pretty sure doctors had stopped wearing those masks.](#spoiler) Don't let any of that discourage you, it was a great film.

dfc6pue,"I watched the entire film with a big smile on my face. True, it fell a little short of the masterpiece that is the original, but I still enjoyed the *fuck* out of this film.

It hit the right notes of nostalgia and added it's own extra little flourishes and touches. Mark Kermode said in his review that he felt that the setting was not properly realised, but I didn't find that at all. I found the village, the forest and the castle to be utterly immersive.

I thought Emma sung quite well, again, not as good as Paige O'Hara, but I was expecting something much flatter from her, thanks to the reviews. Her voice is simple but sweet, and she was certainly capable, if not extraordinary. Audra McDonald was definitely the musical MVP, though. 

If there's one thing I felt that surpassed the 1991 version, it's the added jokes and one-liners, especially from Cogsworth. 

The only thing that did bother me is that the Beast is a lot more douchey in this one, even after he and Belle start to bond. [He has to be manipulated by the servants into letting Belle stay in a comfortable room, rather than Lumiere just suggesting it, and he's rather snarky and sarcastic in the library scene rather than playful and gracious](#spoiler)",5zuxzg

df2z7qo,"Just a heads up, if you’re a fan of Emma Watson, you might not want to read this.
I was not a fan of this movie.
Alright, I did enjoy some parts of it. I really did. But all in all, this movie feels stale. Say what you want about the Cinderella remake but at least that had energy and fun to it. This remake feels so boring in comparison. And honestly, I think the fault lies squarely with Emma Watson. Not only can she not sing but she also doesn’t fully get into the role of Belle. Belle is probably one of the most iconic Disney princesses ever but never does Emma become Belle at any point.
Now the Beast was okay. I think he could have done better but I thought the actor was decent. His singing voice was pretty good and I did like the song he sang.
Also, everyone knows about that big gay moment people were trying to hype up? It’s not that big. It’s barely even there.  So I don’t even know why the tried to make it seem like it was a big, huge progressive step. It wasn’t. 
I’m going to say that if you’re like a diehard Disney fan, go see it. Even though I love Disney, I was still disappointed but I do think other Disney fans might enjoy this. However, if you’re over Disney remakes, I say skip this and wait for the DVD.

df418a5,"**Awful, just awful.**

Emma Watson as Belle....I've been saying this from before the movie came out, but she has been horribly, horribly miscast. 

As per usual, her acting is forced, wooden, expressionless. She cannot convey emotions and her singing is 90% autotune and a huge fail. She is stiff, bored and like a mannequin in her facial expressions; it is like she is a robot programmed for set and very limited range - and I am pushing it, calling her ability ""range"". She is just READING the lines, not ACTING them. It was so SOULLESS. 

There were a lot of plot holes, the ""gay scene"" isn't even worth a mention, Belle's dress was an utter disaster - I have seen plenty of cosplays that have done justice to its animated beauty far more than this PROFESSIONALLY DESIGNED yellow blob. 

Some of the costumes were off (Belle's town's outfits...trying too hard to be unique and ""stand out"") and some of the special effects were almost uncanny valley and awkward. So many scenes just looked SO CHEAP, the CGI was awful! The music itself was meh; it was very lackluster in many places and the two leads were pretty bad, especially Miss Belle. 

Emma Watson ruined the movie. She was extremely dull and 100% miscast. A terrible choice for one of Disney's very best films. I've seen kids at local high school talent shows sing and dance and act their hearts out far better than Watson will ever have the ability to do.

She's a dreadful actress. 

**2/10**, waste of time and money. Cinderella, both the recent and the TV Brandy version are way better than this steaming pile.

**Bonus:** If ONLY Anne Hathaway had still been young enough for Belle, she would have been a great choice. She can act, she has these big, gentle doe eyes and a ""soft, graceful"" look about her. And her singing - she won an Oscar for that, let's not forget.

Pity. This movie could have been a classic, but the miscast took so much from it. ",5zuxzg
df2xrml,"Welp. I really wanted to like it. I really did. But it comes in as a solid disappointment. Note: It was not *bad*, and it did not desecrate the original, but yes, it was disappointing. 

I found the music lacking (confirmed with multiple friends so I'm not the only one). The editing I truly believe was pretty awful, with many unnecessary quick cuts and flips back and forth that it impeded the storytelling. Additionally I thought the pacing was off, also getting in the way of the story. I don't think Emma Watson and Dan Stevens had much chemistry. Could also just be me, but I did not like a lot of the character design, particularly for the servants turned into household items. They also couldn't seem to settle on a tone, with multiple cringe scenes and awkward attempts at humor that didn't fit in.

Pros: They fixed some major plotholes (e.g. why the villagers didn't know the castle was there). They did a *great* job with the servants and characterizing them. Honestly, when they were all turning into permanent objects, that was the most emotion I felt the entire movie. Well done. 

Overall: If you're going to remake a great movie that is a timeless classic, you *have* to bring your A-game. It's only fair to the source. And they did not, bottom line. ",5zuxzg

df69wgq,"I thought this film was woefully unnecessary. Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast was magnificent, Walerian Borowczyk's The Beast was a subversive re-imagining of the source material, Disney's animated film was a musical masterpiece and now we have this... It leans heavily on the animated film with superfluous plot threads and additional music that stands out as mediocre next to the iconic tunes from the 1991 film. What's more vexing is that a number of shots from the animated film are replicated in this live action interpretation and I would argue that the shot composition doesn't make sense in the context of a live action film. Beauty and the Beast (2017) doesn't really justify it's own existence, it merely injects more spectacle and filler into a classic film. The only thing that can be said of it, is that the live action film deepens ones appreciation for the animated classic. 

Attempts to make the Beast more sympathetic (he had an abusive father!) and Belle and Maurice's past more tragic (mom/wife dies of the plague in Paris!) were completely hamfisted and weren't well developed enough to have a meaningful impact on this version's interpretation of those characters. I left the theater completely annoyed by this film.",5zuxzg
dfbs7mz,"I honestly think this film will be mean different things for different people (people go in wanting and expecting different things), and the review of it to be very subjective depending on the person. My personal thoughts from the film are as below:

First the bads:
- Though I LOVE Emma Watson as an individual, the acting was unfortunately quite poor. Also I thought she tried (too) hard to make Belle seem ""not lady-like""
- There were so many melodramatic moments..?! Especially the fight scene at the end where Gaston dies and Beast almost dies. There was something just very messy and odd about the whole sequence...
- The mixture of the modern into the traditional was sometimes too off. The input of the gun in the end was slightly random and did not work for me.
- The dance scene between Belle and Beauty... In the original, it is a beautifully heartwarming scene. Yet in this film, nothing really blew me away. Maybe I went in with too high an expectation but I thought cinematography lacked in the scene also...
- Unfortunately also did not feel much chemistry between Belle and Beast.
- This is probably only applicable to my cinema experience, but the sound was very hollow, so it was difficult to fathom out all the words that were spoken...


The goods:
- I liked how Belle and Beast connected with their love for books/reading. The first blossoming of their relationship when they quote Shakespeare... that was really sweet.
- The Cast. Especially in the end when all the AMAZING actors appear in their people-form, from Ewan McGregor, Emma Thompson, Stanley Tucci to Ian McKellen.!
- Gaston was great in this film. Though the movie in general, I think was quite badly put together.... he did a very good job in portraying the character.
- Allows us to re-live the Disney moment.

I went in thinking I would really love this film after having watched Cinderella back in 2015 (which I absolutely loved). Cinderella showed me that a Disney classic COULD be made into a good new product. Was unfortunately disappointed with this one. With that said however, I DID enjoy it. My friend and I both came out feeling lighter than when we went in, and we did get some good laughs out of the funnier scenes in the film.",5zuxzg

He wanted her to change to be his trophy. In this movie Belle seemed more of a snob than Gaston arrogant. Then in the animated movie at the end, Gaston becomes manic and more beastlike in the fight. His death felt warranted in the animated movie. In this one, he wasn't evil enough to warrant a death like that. I was kinda sad for him.",5zuxzg

df5fybo,"Trying to sort through my mixed feeling cause on one hand it was fun to relive some of those moments and songs. The production design was beautiful and there were a few things they added like developing more with Maurice and having the objects become less human as the rose petals fell. But on the other hand Emma Watson's singing was clearly processed to disguise its awfulness and I didn't feel that much chemistry between her and the Beast. The original animated film was 84 minutes while this one is 129 yet I can only think of one or two things that were enhanced by all that extra time. Not to mention the additional plot holes the movie makes for itself.

dfdx25p,"I'd say the Metacritic grade (65/100, 'D') is pretty spot on. It had moments of greatness, and some nice humor. The casting for some characters were better than others. 

The singing was auto-tuned for Watson and a couple others. *(Not a horrible thing, but I kinda have a high bar after seeing Les Mis... I understand this is Disney, but the music is so fucking great I really wish they woulda taken it a bit more conservatively on the production style.)*

My biggest complaint was screenplay/direction. It had no real development. The characters had no backstory, and although it's safe to assume we all know it, it completely deflates as a movie to not witness any character development. This movie could have been really, REALLY good. But this was the main part it couldn't get over. 

Second complaint was what seemed to me to be really lazy animation of the Beast's face. Go back and rewatch anytime the character speaks...the mouth doesn't do even remotely the correct shapes the majority of the time. The songs I had to just close my eyes and listen to it. Just seemed weird to my eyes.

Favorite part of the movie for me was anytime Gaston was on screen. I had my doubts when he was cast but he owned that role and he will be Gaston to me from here on out.

Almost everyone else was great. Great acting and singing all around except....For Emma Watson. This role was too much for her. She still needs work acting and her singing was blatantly autotuned. Every scene she was in she was just seemed very....Stiff and emotionless and she sounded bored some of the time. Shes mediocre at best but was a safe choice I get by Disney to get people to watch it. My ultimate pick for Belle is still Emmy Rossum and I feel like Disney messed up on that. Rossum can act, sing, and looks the part.

Also Belle's dress looked lack luster/cheap. As a whole,the  Cinderella adaption  managed to create their world as somewhere you could actually believe existed in our world. A lot of this film seemed too set like. I wish that it took more creative Liberty to adapt it more to the real world.",5zuxzg
df36b5y,"Just got home from watching it (late show, 12:15am), standard, not 3D (IMO, 3D is unnecessary for a movie like this.   
I agree with the other commenters in saying that Emma Watson was a bit stiff in the role, but it really didn't break the magic (so to speak) for me. I still bought that she was playing Belle, her singing, autuned or not, was still perfectly fine, and any weaknesses on her part were well compensated for (for the most part, see below) by the other actors in the scenes.     
The major criticisms I have are that the added content, including most of the added songs, just bogged down the movie. It already has a few spots that would get slow were it not for the animated version skipping past the romancing portion in the middle.    
To this film's detriment they added extra songs and tried to add context to both The Beast's and Belle's stories (dead mothers... shocking /s) which just killed any momentum the movie had. If the snack bar had been still open I would have gone up for another package of Milk Duds.   
My other criticism is Kevin Kline playing Maurice. It isn't for lack of talent on his part but he was a horrible choice for the role. From the moment he gets captured and starts pleading with The Beast, and then has to talk to Belle, it is obvious that either they needed to do major rewrites (which would have sacrificed authenticity) or should have gotten someone else to play the role.    
In summation of the rest, I think Dan Stevens was decent, not amazing, just decent, but the real stars were Luke Evans as Gaston and Josh Gad as Lefou. The fact that Ian McKellan can play his lines well off anyone should be no surprise from anyone who has seen him act before, but I was surprised at how well Ewan McGregor was opposite him as Cogsworth and Lumière respectively. With respect to Emma Thompson as Mrs Potts, she did a great job but she'll never be Angela Lansbury. This is the one change in actors, even more than the late Jerry Orbach (who's talents were met if not exceeded by Ewan McGregor) that kept breaking me out of the fantasy. Maybe it's nostalgia, but I just couldn't get over it. Overall I'm glad I saw it and if not in theaters I will definitely watch it again when it is released outside of theaters.",5zuxzg
dfh2lez,"After the opening narration and musical numbers, I started to get into it more as the movie went along. Enjoyed the new songs, and most of the renditions of the older songs even if they paled in comparison. 

If there wasn't a big controversy over it, I honestly don't think I would've been realized it because that's just sort of how Josh Gad and the character of LeFou are normally.",5zuxzg
dh7wdao,"I haven't seen the 2017 version, so my review is going to be admittedly limited (I can't speak for the acting, or any particularly specific details), but I can comment on what little I HAVE heard about the film.

For positives, I can say this much:

*The triplets in this now actually DO act as foils for Belle in regards to the moral of the tale, not to mention are actually looking less beautiful than Belle does (either animated or as portrayed by Emma Watson), not to mention doing it in such a way that it also doesn't necessarily mean that had no beauty at all, just no natural beauty. The 1991 version... let's face it, the triplets looked like they outranked BELLE in the looks department in every way due to their possessing Dead or Alive-style bodies (you know, T&As), not to mention actually LOOKED more natural than Belle did (who a few times in the film DID look like she was wearing makeup). What's even worse is that, besides their crush on Gaston, they demonstrated absolutely NO indication of having any inner ugliness at all, which, you know, the intended point of being foils for Belle is giving them inner ugliness specifically to highlight how Belle fits in with the moral. They don't act jealous of Belle for being Gaston's eye-apple, they didn't mock Maurice at all, not even when Gaston and LeFou did mock him within earshot of them AND Belle, they don't participate in the mob (heck, it's even implied that they barely were even AWARE of Gaston's plan due to only reappearing during the reprise after being out of the room starting with the end of the song), among others. If anything, at least regarding the first act, Belle demonstrated more inner ugliness there. With the triplets in the 2017 version, however, they were in fact shown to be particularly spiteful of Belle, and were obviously involved in getting Maurice locked up and, later, trying to murder the Beast. Not to mention, due to their more garish appearances where it's pretty obvious they are only ""beautiful"" due to be excessively dolled up, we can now see why the entire village, let alone Gaston, would view Belle as more beautiful than them, heck, why even their own mother viewed Belle as more beautiful than them, which is pretty much the main reason why they hate Belle. A major improvement, if you ask me. I could care less if they acted more like Drizella and Anastasia from Cinderella, as long as they at least fit into their role well. Heck, their characterizations were even eerily similar to Belle's wicked sisters in the original tale.

*I'm glad that Belle actually HAS some backstory in this, including that her mom had died and thus they actually NEEDED to move to the village to survive and her mom died as a result. It also makes her reasons for wanting out from the village a LOT more understandable and sympathetic. We never really got that in the 1991 version, at most only a throwaway line that mentions that she and her dad moved to the village, with it not even being particularly clear WHEN they had moved, only that it was long enough that Belle had already memorized the schedule of the village. On that note, I'm also very glad that they also had Maurice being somewhat overprotective of Belle, since that at least served as a reason why they didn't just, I don't know, leave the village for good. And I'm also glad that Belle is actually SHOWN to be an inventor like her dad in this, because it never really made sense why Belle neither showed the ability nor the interest to invent in the 1991 version considering she was raised by her dad, who WAS an inventor by trade. I'm also glad that they at least gave Belle some physical limitations in this, since 1. it actually allowed Beast to get up on the horse on his own initiative, and 2. it made more sense why Belle couldn't just, I don't know, knock Gaston out, steal a torch, and set the paddywagon on fire to save Maurice instead of endangering Beast and the others at the castle (wasn't happy with that scene in the 1991 version, mostly because it made Belle look like a complete idiot and needlessly generated conflict that way).

*I'm pretty glad that they got rid of the whole ""woodcutter"" element for the story, especially nearing the climax, because 1., it actually allowed Maurice to actually show some balls after largely being treated as a joke in the 1991 film, even when he does try to save Belle by himself by actually saving her, and 2., that scene never made any sense because neither Maurice nor Belle had any time to even set it back together after presumably dismantling the whole thing for ease of carrying to the fair. It shouldn't have been put together at all, let alone in working condition. Oh, and I'm also glad that they cut out the whole wedding setup scene and the Gaston reprise, mostly because, for the former, having Belle knock Gaston into mud and then smirk and wave goodbye in a mocking manner (meaning that was intentional, and not simply due to self-defense) cast Belle in a pretty unpleasant light (even when taking into account Gaston's actions, and really only served to make BOTH parties very unsympathetic), and for the latter, honestly, that whole reprise seemed to be conceived solely as a means to cynically show Gaston was a bad guy to children and needlessly demonized the villagers by a great amount by casting them as the types of people who would in fact support someone screwing over a guy he explicitly stated was harmless by throwing him into a nuthouse just so he'd have blackmail material, which in reality most people WOULDN'T support that at all.

*Lumiere and Plumette were an actual couple in this, presumably married, which is actually a good thing and actually makes them sympathetic (in the 1991 film, the former was a womanizer, and the latter was implied to be sexually loose, and quite frankly, I found that very inappropriate for a children's film, not to mention made them, especially Lumiere, out to be very unsympathetic.).

*Pere Robert actually was a good addition since not only did it fix a plothole regarding Belle and Maurice, not to mention the entire village (namely, why would the bookstore still be in business if no one was even literate? To say little of how Belle could afford to get those books, not just in terms of expenses, but also in terms of time spent on them, and yet STILL not leave the village alongside her dad), but his overall character, from his sympathy towards Belle's bibliophilic nature, his attempting to help Maurice instead of sending him to the nuthouse, even his horror at the mob, painted Christianity in a positive light, which warms my heart especially after all the flack we Christians are getting (not to mention is a MAJOR improvement over the 1991 film where the closest equivalent to Robert, the bookseller, was just a bookseller, and that the villagers, due to being strongly implied to be devoted to their religion, were demonized as well as portrayed as idiotic while Belle, the intelligent one in terms of the story, isn't even implied to be religious at all), and was actually a pretty accurate depiction of Christianity, especially Catholicism's view on women's literacy (they actively encouraged literacy among both genders, and even had convents to teach women how to do that, if they didn't learn it in the home, which is contrary to what feminists would claim. I'm actually pleasantly surprised that Emma Watson would let that and Maurice's expanded role be included despite her feminism. She earned my respect.). On a related note, I'm glad that they don't demonize marriage nearly as much as in the 1991 version.

*Quite frankly, having Beast not even approving of Belle being granted her own bedroom instead of a cell actually made Beast and Belle's argument/hissy-fit make more sense, considering the Beast in that case clearly didn't want that and already had that in play when Belle refused to come down to dinner (not to mention also, at least by a small amount, also made Belle a bit more sympathetic in their argument). The 1991 version essentially made Belle look more unsympathetic in that argument considering she refused to dine with Beast even after he took pains to try to be polite to her at the servants prodding. On a related note, I'm glad Belle no longer blames Beast for her leaving the forest, or at least it wasn't treated as a genuine argument (I hated that part, since far from empowering Belle, it made her look irresponsible who is unwilling to admit responsibility for things she caused and wants to blame others for her own mistakes).

*Some plot holes, like Phillipe knowing WHERE the castle was, or how the villagers didn't seem to know about the beast or his castle despite it literally being a walk away, were fixed in this version, which was pretty good considering those admittedly were very annoying, and they even removed the timeframe which avoided any needless complications.

*Gaston actually comes across as pretty impressive in this, especially compared to the 1991 version, thanks to the Gaston reprise being cut, now we actually CAN see him as being a cheap shot without him outright telling us that in the reprise by blurting it out in public like an idiot. And even the one lyric that does hint at him being a backstabber, the bit about preferring to shoot animals when their backs were turned, at least applied in a manner that most people wouldn't suspect was applicable to humans (they were talking about hunting).

*Did I mention that I'm glad that Maurice actually comes across as a very good dad in this? Certainly far better than the 1991 version?

And quite frankly, despite Emma Watson's role, it actually came across as being less feministic than the 1991 original (even with the unfortunate scene showcasing the villagers intolerance to Belle's love of reading), which was a good thing, because the 1991 version to be honest read like a feminazi's screed.

df2wwoj,"I loved the original, and went into this one hoping it would be great but expecting it to be terrible. It was worse than I expected. I was already a bit bummed that Disney are remaking all these animations for no reason but money, but such is life. Emma Waston really shat the bed on this one. I'm not a fan of her, she's never been exceptionally good in any of her roles (I have seen most), and I have really disliked some of her performances. She nearly ruined Perks of Being a Wallflower with her wooden acting. She doesn't have a background in singing, and I was really hoping she would surprise me, but she can't sing worth a damn. You can tell she might be decent if they hadn't processed her voice all to hell. And it's not just her. I love Ewan McGregor's voice, and it was solid, then they would auto-tune the last few words of a verse, and ruin the entire thing. I felt like the casting was a bit off too. Dan Stevens is one of my favorite actors, but he's a little dorky guy, and he could not pull off the human beast. Josh Gad was one of the only guys I thought would knock it out of the park, but he would start singing in an English accent then go back to American in the song, ""Gaston."" Luke Evans did great, outside of a few of those unnecessary auto-tuned lines, he nailed the singing portion, and was much more of an antagonist than in the original. Still, his jaw isn't big enough (that was a joke). I still would have liked to see Hugh Jackman do Gaston. To be honest, I think Luke Evans should've been the beast, and Jackman could've been Gaston.

The songs were amazing even the original one were the beast left, i didn't think Dan stevens had it in him to sing that well. It gave me some phillip quast vibes.

Emma Watson set the tone perfectly as Belle, she has a nice tone to her voice, not as good as pages though i must admit but once she got going i was really impressed.

I really loved Gastons tough feel at the begining. And as for Lafou that gay subplot fits in perfectly with why he wants to stick with him all the time. The only thing was he turned good Way too quickly. Mrs Pots just told him to turn good an theres no explanation he just turns good.

I cried when he said "" the libearys yours""
I also cried when the furniture turned inanimate.
I cried when they danced
I cried when he transformed
I cried at the ending.

It stayed true to the cartoon.
Its lived up to the hype. It really did
I have one question though,
Did Gaston fall off the bridge in the cartoon?

I loved how they used the old hag in the ending and Belle didn't even realize.

Also  that scene when Beast was singing when he let Belle go gave me Notre dame vibes.

As this was so good give Notre dame that director and special effects, keep the songs an we have another perfect disney flix once again.

It sucks that they stuck to the original animated story line beat for beat, not because it's bad, but because the pacing of the animated original is *way* better. It feels awkward and forcibly fast in this live action version.

The only complaint I had was Emma Watson's singing. They tried to work with it as much as possible, but it was still bad and distracting. 

Otherwise, she was a great Belle and I really loved the movie. I had been looking forward to this for a long time and it didn't disappoint whatsoever. I found myself laughing and smiling and experiencing all the emotions of the movie. 

It definitely stayed true to the original, while adding its own touch in ways I thought added to it, fleshing out the storyline. It was never going to be an original movie, nor did it try to.

df26mxk,"Best Disney film I've *ever* seen.

That's a grand statement to make and I love so many Disney films, but this just blew me away. The visuals, the music, the sets, the costumes, BE OUR GUEST. They threw in some LGBT subtexts and it just deepened the story. 

And the Enchantress! The new songs! Paris! Luke Evans as Gaston! The ""death"" scenes! So much to love here. ",5zuxzg
df1ahfq,"Pretty darn average if you're not a big fan of the original. My fiancee loved it, though. It wasn't bad.. just ""pretty good"" at best for me. (Note: musicals aren't my jam.)

Gay LeFou was possibly the best character. I'm a Christian.. this film isn't going to brainwash any children into being gay. Just causes a few good laughs. Don't be stupid, if your kid wants to see it.. take them. 

Overall the film is passable. But I don't see this overtaking the classic status of the original. Like most are saying, the singing is debatable. I didn't find it distracting, but it definitely didn't wow me.

df1g0sk,"Thought it was pretty terrible but admittedly not my fave Disney story. Direction-wise it's a mess, trying to understand the geography of a scene is challenging and to me, a lot of the music played out like people lip syncing instead of giving a performance.

df5gih9,"I will be interested to see how this film does in the coming weeks, considering those who loved the original will undoubtedly see it opening weekend, and that's who this move seeks to please. And it does this well; it is visually brilliant, stays mostly true to the original, and is casted damn near perfectly. Yet this is NOT a movie people should support. Here's why. 

It isn't a good enough movie to justify its existence. It didn't improve in any way upon the original in its comparable areas. The songs were not as good as their original counterparts (especially Be Our Guest, despite the visual appeal); the plot points added were very clearly lazily thrown in (the book that takes you anywhere? And she claims she's not free? She could have used that to go ANYWHERE SHE WANTED.); while it was visually great it had several moments where it just looked too dark; the beast is not menacing enough to take seriously, and most of the time the audience is supposed to fear him he's shrouded in dark. It is these reasons that make this movie a 6 while it was trying to match up to one of the greatest movies to come out of the Disney Renaissance. That's why I would watch the original over this any day. 

And that's my big gripe. This movie SHOULD be better. Disney is a pioneer for imagination and originality in movies; these movies are purely nostalgic memberberries, and lack the depth and originality that their source had that captured our hearts. There are plenty of movies that we can watch for aesthetic pleasure and to turn our brain off. Disney should be actively going against this model, but their remaking of all their classics is just going to spiral into a decade of style over substance. And that's what this movie is, and that's why we should reject it. I'm not crapping on those who love the movie, I am asking them to recognize that we deserve better from the conglomerate that is Disney.  

Edit: grammar and spelling",5zuxzg

I was fairly upset when they re-released the movie with new music and animation... so when I found out that there was going to be a live action movie, I was beside myself. Then I thought about it more, and realised I was just like the people online that piss me off, I was judging something that I couldn't possible know the outcome of, I was being a prejudiced asshole. It could end up being good for all I knew. And even if the live-action movie ended up being terrible, the cartoon will always exist, my VHS, DVD, and BluRay versions won't suddenly be overwritten with the live action version. All will still be right with the world.

Tonight, my partner and I went and watch the LA version and to be honest I thought it was fine. It's not perfect, but neither is the original. I have problem with both, and I think I will love both, not equally, but close.

I particularly liked that Luke Evans looked older than Emma Watsons, I though it added an extra layer of creepiness to Gaston's attraction.

In terms of the songs, I liked the group songs better (though I expected more from Be Our Guest). I wish they hadn't cast Ewan McGregor as Lumiere and I still have mixed feelings about LeFou being gay, mostly because I felt like, if they hadn't made that announcement, but kept his character the way he was in the film, how would ppl have reacted?

By far the best live action rendition of any Disney princess story. in my opinion. The casting even actually surprised me. At first I thought Emma Watson was perfect Belle but I thought about what the quintessential Belle is - a smart, spoken, adventurous and brave girl (beauty aside). Emma Watson fit more into the shoe as she walled with it. Not to mention the star studded cast that are all brilliant in their own light.

Belle is the most beautiful girl in town and she's got the most handsome guy in town after her, but she's not happy till she literally lives in a castle? Like, she only started falling in love with the Beast after he showed off his ""expensive education"" by mocking her literary taste, and then his huge library, when he says ""If you like it so much, it's yours."" 

The problem is that it takes away from the romance, when she's seen as falling in love with his money and status, rather than him. This kind of thing raises little girls to be disappointed when they don't get the Beast with the big Castle. I just kept thinking this movie really shows why the French revolution happened. Give me a proletarian love story between two common people any day, that would be far more romantic. Show the dignity of common people, living lives that actually happen.

I guess they explained away why all those people attending the party forgot about the castle, but it still seems less plausible to me then a dark and stormy night where the witch was seeking shelter. In this version, she basically just barges in on their party (not even using the front door!). I think it also took away some of the magic of seeing all the Prince for the first time after the transformation. We saw the picture but it was torn. The music building up to the moment when he turns around was such a great moment in the original and here it felt less magical because we had seen him before.

I ask because I thought the beginning of the movie was right before the war and the ending was after.  

In the animated movie a line from a song says ""For 10 years we've been rusting"".   

The French Revolution lasted for 10 years. 

Also, in the new movie Gaston is referenced as war veteran at least twice and is addressed as ""Captain"" by Bells dad.  

It was mentioned the first time in the beginning while Lefou and Gaston were riding around the Fields talking about Bell.  The second was when Gaston was assaulting Bells dad in the woods and Lefou said something along the lines of ""remember your happy place, remember the war.  Remember the widows"".  And it calms Gaston down.  

So I belive Belle and the Beast would be safe from the Revolution because I believe it took place between him being cursed and the curse being lifted.

It made sense for the character, in keeping with the other additions they made to the story.

Did people really make a fuss about it? I have a lot of conservative Christian friends (who are normally all over this sort of thing) and I don't think I saw a single person even mention it on Facebook.

She proceeded to ask:

*Wife*: Don't tell me they turned Lumière gay?

*Me*: No, it's LeFou. 

*Wife*: Oh, right.... Yeah... he's totally gay. 

Anyways, we wen't to see the film, and she loved it. She thought the ""controversial"" scene was pretty funny. 

**Clarification**: Before anybody just assumes my wife is a bigot, she is not. She is Christian and of course she holds to some Christian values. She is however pro marriage equality. Beauty and The Beast was her favorite film when she was growing up, so she was afraid they had ruined a movie she holds dear to her heart, just to make a political statement. ",5zuxzg
dfydvli,"The ""gay"" moments I picked were:

* When LeFoo gets carried away during the Gaston song and hugs him then Gaston says it was too much.
* Gaston asks why LeFoo can't get a girl, he says he's too clingy and Gaston goes quiet. Like he knows how LeFoo gets attached and maybe considered LeFoo has a crush on him too (idk)
* When the wardrobe transforms those three men so they're wearing feminine clothing and makeup, two of them scream but one is extremely happy with the result. 
* When they're all dancing at the end, Lefoo starts dancing with a woman then dances with a man. Though that seems more bisexual than gay. ",5zuxzg

So it wasn't just something that Disney came up with to make Beast more pitiable or something.

Correction- that time frame would have been Arthas, Sylvanas, Illidan, and Jaina. Clearly the most interesting place to start the story. Also didn't more people play Warcraft 3? I dragged non-WoW people and some of them had actually played that (and I didn't).",5zuxzg

To me it made it feel more grounded in reality, even if it's still a fairytale reality. It gave it a distinct aesthetic unlike any other Disney film. It was so beautiful. 

I think Agatha absolutely directed Maurice to the castle through the lightning striking the tree. I'm a bit torn on her motivations in the story, honestly. I can't decide if she's good or evil, or neither. Her actions hurt a lot of people, including an innocent child (Chip), but in the end, the Prince and the village are better off for it. Her curse brings a renewal of goodness and grace (Belle's influence) to the castle's inhabitants and to the villagers in the region, where previously they were selfish and callous (the Prince's influence, and later Gaston's). It's fun to think ahead to the French Revolution, where perhaps the Prince and Belle are saved from the fate of other nobles by the virtue of their uncommonly happy villagers...

I'm glad you also think it had much to offer. I've read so many reviews saying that there's no new ideas or depth to the characters and the story in this film... I don't understand that perspective at all. I thought Emma's Belle, while similar to the animated version, was different enough to be of interest. Due to the tragedy of her mother's death and having grown up in a town where she doesn't fit in, this Belle is subdued. She's aware of her isolation. It hurts her and gives her a gravity that animated Belle doesn't have, and for me personally it was more relatable.  Emma's influence is obvious here, in the way that Belle doesn't wear a corset, and how the ""Disney Princess"" mannerisms are downplayed (compare the hyper feminine body language of Lily James' Cinderella to Emma's graceful but rustic Belle). She felt less like a Disney Princess and more like, well, a real person.

It's almost blasphemous to say, but I think I love this version as much as the original. The animation is a better musical. This adaption is a better character drama. They're both great!",5zuxzg
dinmuvh,"What I don't get about Agatha.  She cursed The Beast and the entire castle including at least one child and a dog simply because the prince wouldn't allow a stranger to spend the night in his home.  Yet, she knows Gaston to be a complete jerk who attempted to murder another man, have that man committed to a crazy house for accusing him of said attempted murder, and who also verbally insulted her, and she does nothing more than roll her eyes at him.",5zuxzg
dgjkbwi,"I think Maurice was definitely encouraged to go to the castle because of how they showed the path after the lightning strike; that shot of the path tells a lot. I wasn't a big fan of Agatha resurrecting the Beast at the end, but I liked her presence before then. I think she definitely was rooting for the Beast. I thought the whole thing was very layered and interesting.",5zuxzg
df1ygwq,">For example, they closed the plot hole of why none of these villagers seem to know there's a fucking castle within marching distance.

I think it's funny that they haven't had to pay taxes all this time, and now Belle went and ruined it. ",5zuxzg
df1gurx,"BOOM! Really agree with you on the beast and belle aspect. In the new movie, you see them interact so much more and it makes more sense that she would love him. ",5zuxzg
df1q8lx,"> I think the biggest strength of the live action comes to the Beast, however. I always felt like, in the original, it never really made a ton of sense why Belle fell in love with him. Like, he saved her, yeah, and they played a little in the snow, but she's already falling for him at that point, so the romance always felt sort of half assed. It always felt like she was giving him a pity fuck more than she actually cared about him. This movie made him more of a character, delved into him, and gave him and Belle more room to interact. He's a proper partner for Belle, who is touted as little miss independent and free thinker, so it makes it more believable when she falls in love with the educated, intellectual and sometimes sarcastically witty Beast from the live action.

This is what I've been telling my friends and family when they ask how it was. This is so important. The original is something I adore, but I never really believed the romance. This made something absurd (a young woman falling in love with a man turned into a really ugly and terrifying beast) as believable as they could.

df3oce2,"Totally. I went in pretty pessimistic about it but was so surprised. I'm more  shocked about the backlash I'm seeing online. 

Just a quick Google is revealing tons of articles claiming that the cgi of beast and the supporting cast was done in a way that didn't make them expressive enough. 

I couldn't disagree more.  I mean, even my wife was saying Beast seemed more attractive in beast form, lol! 

I thought Emma Watson is so fucking cute that I had no problem watching her face all night. That she doesn't suck at acting is even better.

But Jesus...the spectacle of the whole thing. How epic was seeing Be Our Guest in imax? The colors, the images, the music...I'm honestly blown away at the kind of films we are able to make these days. It's a technical marvel but also an emotional one. When miss Potts answers the question to why did beast let her go with ""because he's in love.""...sorry but that emotional moment wasn't in the original.

This is coming from a self proclaimed French new wave cinephile. My area of expertise is films from 60-70. I'm only mentioning this to say that I might not be the target audience. 

Regardless, I guess my point is  this film had magic in it. And it bums me out that the gay controversy and conflict with the original film seems to cast a shadow over it.",5zuxzg
df6gruf,"I agree with most facets of this post.

I especially loved the change in character to Maurice. He was much more relatable, but it was still believable that the town might have thought he was mad once he had seen a ""beast.""

I disagree about Luke Evans. His Gaston character was a step down to me from the original. He was less of a caricature, which fits a live action movie rather than animated.

But, even though it's more fitting, I like the over-the-top, thinks he's everyone's hero, self-absorbed Gaston. Luke Evans' character had enough of that, but it was too subdued, in my opinion.

But, the changes they made, such as what you pointed out with Beast and Belle, and Gaston trying to woo Belle, by ""believing"" her father-- those were smart changes.

I think I'll still prefer the 1991 version purely due to nostalgia, but this movie could have been plenty worse. And I'm glad it did the story justice",5zuxzg

He's a proper partner for Belle, who is touted as little miss independent and free thinker, so it makes it more believable when she falls in love with the educated, intellectual and sometimes sarcastically witty Beast from the live action.

Agreed. Evermore is a beautiful song. If there's one thing they did right, it was giving the Beast his own song to express his feelings.

1) all the charecters had an *english* accent. I would of been fine with that and assumed it was set in england, except for the bonjour singing at the start.

3)really bland acting, especially emma watson.
4)sound track wasnt lovable, and at times the instramentals drowned out the singing
5) live action made me constantly aware the beast was infact not human, and its super weird watson fell for him, regardless of his inner kindness or what not. Like wouldnt it be super weird if belle fell in love with that horse????

I will say this is probably the hardest live action movies disney could have done, cgi had to be included, and while obvious, the cgi wasnt horrible.

Anthropomorphic characters stick out as obviously implausible elements in a film that tries to look completely authentic and credible.

dgf9nho,"> In the original, the Beast quite obviously does it as a kind gesture as his feelings are starting to develop, whereas in this he sort of begrudgingly shows her it, it felt less romantic somehow.

I think it being less romantic works. At this point in the story the Shakespeare thing is their only interest, and it's his chance to show her what he finds comfort or peace in. It's obviously an important thing to him which is why he wouldn't be over the moon letting her in (metaphorically as well as physically) but does it as a way to open up to her. 

I do agree though about it seeming quite quick. I couldn't put my finger on it but it just felt a bit off seeing all this development in a song montage rather than actually seeing it. The scene with them discussing Shakespeare for the first time was one of my favourites, and more of that was needed. Literally nothing more than just the two of them talking and discovering common interests. 

I think we could have cut a lot from the movie in favour of focusing on Beauty and the Beast. Things like the time it took to get Belle at the castle and some of the songs like Gaston's or Be Our Guest just went on far too long. A few trimmings here and there and a few character focused additions would have gone a long way. I did care about their relationship, but literally 5 more minutes sprinkled throughout would have done so much for me. 

I think one of the biggest scene omissions was him asking her to dance. I think that would have solidified his feelings and that's a pretty big milestone. In some ways asking her (or any girl really) to dance requires as much courage as anything else. This would not only make him relateable but it's just a cute scene to add. I'm not sure what it was like in the original, but it did bother me how he says something like ""she looked beautiful and I asked her to dance"". FUCKING SHOW ME THIS.",5zuxzg

dggh15z,"> I thought Luke Evans absolutely killed it as Gaston

I just watched the movie yesterday and had the same thought. I know I should enjoyed it as it is but couldn't help to compare with the original, and Belle is still lacking something. In comparison, Gaston, from the first appearance to the Kill The Beast scene, steals the show. He has strong presence and strong characterization, reflected in his voice.

>Also, I liked Ian McKellen

When Cogsworth turned back to human, my first impression: ""Gandalf?""

I didn't follow the casting of the movie (except for Emma Watson), so having Sir Ian McKellen there is a great surprise for me.",5zuxzg
df6kd8p,"I liked the addition of the Beast's father not for what it added to the Beast's characterization, but for what it added to the servents'. Belle laments that the servents are included in the Beasts punishment despite having done nothing, and Mrs. Pott says, ""You're right, we did nothing"" meaning, they saw that the Beast was turning into a horrible young man, and did nothing to prevent it. I loved it, because Mrs. Potts isn't saying the servents deserve being cursed or anything, but she recognizes the result of their inaction. That connection could have been made without the father being a horrible person, but it was a useful way to make that connection nonetheless.",5zuxzg

i haven't seen the live action version yet but it's hard to imagine how they could have made him more gay in that song [than the original...](https://youtu.be/VuJTqmpBnI0?t=58) (honestly gaston comes off [kinda gay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuJTqmpBnI0&feature=youtu.be&t=171) too). i'm guessing gaston asking him about marriage at the end comes out very similar to gobber's line in ""how to train your dragon 2,"" which you're right, would fly right over most kids' heads and certainly not be the big deal people made it out to be. i always got kind of a sense that whoever told the press lefou ""explores his sexuality"" used those words to deliberately incite a scandal and get people talking about a movie that otherwise i (and possibly a lot of people) were feeling pretty ""meh"" about.",5zuxzg

The original Beauty and the Beast was fantastic--there is no reason to retread the same ground. Instead of taking the story to new and interesting places, they shoehorned in superfluous backstory and new music which sucks compared to the original tracks. This film directly copies a substantial amount of dialog from the animated classic, contains shots that are exact copies and then crams in nonsense to pad a tightly told 84 minute movie into a 2 hour crock of shit. It doesn't provide a new perspective on the story, it doesn't do anything new with the characters (the fate of Belle's mother has an insignificant impact on Belle as a character and the plot in general) and doesn't deviate from the established flow of events.

If she doesn't want them to get there, they'll never find it.

I was wondering what people's thoughts on this were? I'm sure it's in the original song too, I just found it interesting.

Maybe it's just a phrase that made its way into everyday language.

df7n6fc,"> honestly dont get why there was such a fuss over the gay scenes...

I think it's quite easy to have an honest debate about this and get a non-controversial answer. IMO it is not so much the act of these scenes or similar controversial changes it is what they wider represent.

Firstly Hollywood is as stuck in a rut as it has ever been, endless sequels, reboots and remakes. The problem with these projects is the audience has pre-expectations of what the story and characters are like and are not particularly lenient on change of any kind.

When adding or making changes to audience loved established worlds and story's, it really should be foremost in everyone involved in the productions mind as to whether the addition or change adds value, and weather audiences will appreciate that value.

Political messages in films can be powerful and films built around political messages can be brilliant - think Philadelphia or American History X.

However it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone when established entity's are changed for a political message and people don't like it. Recent controversies that spring to mind being Ghostbusters, Sulu and this.

Does it really matter that Sulu was gay? of course not. But then why change it? What did it add other than a political message. Same in this film. Ghostbusters had a lot of issues but the ire with the female cast from what I saw wasn't so much the fact they were all female but a combination of the reason for this choice and the lack of respect for the established world and characters.

Are gay characters in new IP vilified and cause controversy? Do people care that much? To me they seem not to. People (including a big bunch of men) loved Bridesmaids but many hated Ghostbusters. The same audience that apparently didn't like that film because it has strong female leads loved the Hunger Games.

I think the problem Hollywood has is that audience in general do not like changes, controversial changes that don't add value and appear to be made for ideological reasons will always be that, controversial. I think that is fully  understandable personally.

He could have been standing there applauding and still fallen -- the falling isn't strongly tied to his actions, and detracts from the action->consequence chain.

The point was the Beast spared him because of what Belle taught him about being more gentle, kind and making the effort to not hurt people. Gaston is the bad guy because he doesn't give a shit about hurting anyone as long as he gets what he wants (shooting Beast, harassing Belle, forcing Lefoo to lie, punching and tying up Maurice, having Maurice committed). Dude does all these things so he can continue manipulating his power. If he decided to walk away from the pointless fight like Beast did, he wouldn't have died because he would've seen the bridge collapsing. Works into how self absorbed he really is. Beast began putting other people's best interests ahead of his own, Gaston never did and he lost everything as a result.

I can see how they might think the magic would become essentially defunct if the Beast dies, so having the enchantress there to actually witness the situation enabled her to patch things up - technically yes, the Beast died before the profession of love and that could have been the end of it, but she saw that regardless her demands had been met and decided to ""count"" it anyway.

df1k7ni,"I've seen a lot of people on this thread say, ""oh, it's because critics are nostalgic for the original film"", but I don't think that's entirely the case. I did note that quite a few critics lambasted the film for what they perceieved to be ""portraying a LGBTQ+ character as a joke"" (Le Fou), and being upset over the movie ""not doing more for LGBTQ+ representation"". However, I feel like this is an unfair criticism, because it's Disney. Making Le Fou gay, and backing up this choice, is already a *huge* step for them.

Yet the film, for all its positives, also has its drawbacks. Emma Watson, for me, was unfortunately one of the biggest drawbacks in the film, and I say that as a fan of hers. Personality-wise, she's perfect for Belle, but for me, her acting and singing really fell flat for me at certain points during the movie. I'd compare it to how jarring and sub-par Russell Crowe's singing was in *Les Miserables*. Emma's singing, I feel, was also really overshadowed by the other singers in this film. 

From her interviews, Emma Watson seems to be exactly the perfect fit for Belle. Yet, during the film, to my dismay, she never showed that real, genuine side of herself. I kept asking myself, ""Where is the Emma Watson who loves books? The Emma Watson who buys books and leaves them on trains for others to find / read? The Emma Watson who is shy, but very real and genuine in her interactions?"" 

Much of her performance seemed to be her focusing too much on trying to do justice to one of her self-proclaimed favorite characters (Belle). It's very disappointing to see someone open up so freely in her interviews, but when it comes time to perform, she just completely (emotionally) walls herself off. It's incredibly disappointing because you think, ""I *know* she can do better than this. She *has* done better than this. So why isn't she doing better?""

(As an edit, I realized later, this might actually be the director Bill Condon's fault. Condon also directed Kristen Stewart, who had the same issues as Watson, in *The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1*.)

There are also quite a few plot / writing / character development issues. I think that they tried to focus on developing too many characters in the movie, at the expense of some others. ",5zuxzg

That is not a fault with the 3D technology itself, but with the quality of the projection at your theater.

Proper 3D projection does not darken the image (compared to the 2D version, I mean. The glasses will always darken the image a bit, but a proper 3D projection would turn the brightness up to compensate).

Also, it's possible that you saw the 2D version in 4k and the 3D in 2k, since many theaters have upgraded their 2D projectors to 4k, but not the 3D. That would definitely impact the overall quality of the image.",5zuxzg

I also though her chemistry with Beast was pretty solid.  I loved the scene where she is nursing his wounds and they have a very marriage like exchange (If you didn't run away, this wouldn't have happened!  Well if you didn't scare me, I wouldn't have run away!)  

Overall, it seems that some people wanted a bit more of exaggerated expressions from her.  One example being the criticism of her during ""Be Our Guest.""  I personally thought she did a good job of not taking away from the scene.  She was not at all the focal point, so I think it's better she not take attention from it.  Not to mention if you saw a bunch of plates and shit flying around giving you some show, how would you feel?  She seemed hesitantly happy, which given the circumstances, is how many of us would feel.

I'm sure they use digital tools to make everyone in the movie sound better, yet Emma Watson has been singled out for this criticism. None of the male talent has this problem. Truly mind-boggling (sexism still alive and well in our day?)

Nobody's complaining about the male pitch-correction because it's nowhere near as noticeable as Emma Watson's pitch-correction. Nobody's complaining about the *female* pitch-correction (apart from Emma Watson) because it's nowhere near as noticeable as Emma Watson's pitch-correction and this isn't a criticism coming from sexism.

Emma Watson's pitch-correction stands out for two reasons:

1. It's far more noticeable in the [opening number ""Belle""](https://youtu.be/nT1VQkTTT7M), which draws attention to it in later songs

2. Emma Watson is the lead in the film and sings for a substantial portion of the film

And honestly, that criticism isn't really leveled at Emma Watson herself; it's leveled at whoever made the decision to pitch-correct her voice to that degree. I don't know if Emma Watson can sing and I'll never know until she actually sings in a movie where Disney doesn't autotune all the humanity out of her voice.

Disney's animation department went in a few years from almost being scrapped entirely... to making this. It's an astonishing feat, considering.

It premiered at the New York Film Festival still in its rough draft (with only 70% of the animation completed), and managed to get a 10min standing ovation.

I guess what it comes down to is that somewhat like ""Frozen"", Beauty and the Beast solidified that to the public Disney was back in its prime (after a long period of lackluster animation and flops).",5zuxzg
df1fwr3,"The Lion King was Disney's victory lap/mic drop after Mermaid, Beauty and Aladdin.  The animation department went from on the brink of closing to the genuine powerhouse.  ",5zuxzg
df1jhra,"Well /u/MulciberTenebras answer is informative so i'll try and give a different aspect. BatB is on of my favorite animated movies, but I didn't really live through the release and so all of that backstory is lost on me (I was 3 or 4 when the movie came out).

BatB is one of my favorite animated movies because it's so well constructed in nearly every facet.

* **The music is great**: The opening prologue music in particular is beautiful and haunting and magical, a perfect representation of the beast we are about to encounter.
* **The songs are great**: Every song in the animated version is great. They aren't annoying, they don't go on too long, they are catchy, and they move the plot or develop characters. Think about how much we learn about Gaston through his song. (""No one plots like Gaston, Takes cheaps shot like Gaston, tries to persecute harmless crackpots like Gaston""). And this is all in spite of not having a poppish ""hook"" song like many other animated musicals have had. This doesn't have A Whole New World, or Circle of Life, or Let It Go, or Bare Necessities. This movie's most famous song is a slow moving love ballad sang by Angela Lansbury. It's just earnest, brilliant song writing.
* **The animation is incredible**: The depth of color and the softness of the lines had been missing from animation for decades, but BatB brought them back. The detail packed into every frame is beautiful. This was one of the earlier instances of using CGI to animate a film. The dance scene in the ballroom featured a computer-generated ballroom, allowing the animators to more freely move the camera around and create depth.  The success of this scene (and this movie in general) helped give Disney the gumption to further invest in computer animation, giving us many ""modern"" things we love as film lovers - chief among them being PIXAR.
* **The story is well-structured**: The movie clocks in at only *84 minutes*. That's awfully short, even for animation standards. But it does not feel like a short movie. There is so much plot development, character development, and world building built into every single scene. The structure is incredibly economic. But more than that, the story is just good. The title song has it right there in the first line - this is a tale as old as time. We all have a little bit of Belle and of The Prince inside of us. Anybody who watches this film has the opportunity to experience it in multiple ways.
* **The characters are great**: Who the fuck doesn't like Belle? She's smart. She's determined. She won't let any shit happen to the people she cares about - she fearlessly pursues after her father when she suspects something has happened. She fearlessly runs from the Prince that she loves to save her father (again). And she fearlessly runs to save her Prince when Gaston's antics threaten his life - and the life of his servants that she has come to call friends. Gaston is the perfect kind of despicable - a suave, sleazy, and rugged bully with a penchant for the dramatic. He is my favorite type of Disney villain: he isn't *evil* perse, he's just doesn't care about anybody if they don't help him get what he wants.
* **The morality is great**: It's easy to write Belle off as just another beautiful Disney princess. If you do, shame on you, for that's hardly better than what Gaston thinks about her. Gaston doesn't care about her quirks or her interests, or her family (or even her really). The Beast, however, never seems to care about how beautiful of face she is. He doesn't really give much of any thought to her until they bond over his library. Much like Belle's love for The Beast, his love for her is about the inner beauty. But even ignoring the romance angle, it's a simple story about how selflessness and kindness can lead to happiness and fulfillment. 
* **That opening prologue though**: Nothing to say about it really, it's just so beautiful. A perfect combination of music, animation, and efficient storytelling. This is a perfect microcosm of the brilliance of the movie.

Hope that helped answer the question for you!",5zuxzg

It just really would've made me so happy to see *""And introducing ____ as Belle!""* launching a career like a real life fairy tale, and (especially if it was from a non-English-speaking country) introducing the whole world to a beautiful voice and talent that most of us probably would've never experienced otherwise.

The original character of Belle had the trappings of a world where women were just love interests in a movie, damsels to be saved, and oh gosh golly Gaston, I just have so much to do today. Her personality was charming but bland.  Emma creates the modern Belle we all deserve, and that our little girls deserve as a role model. She had real agency, didn't fall apart in tears, didn't resign herself to eternal prison, and radiated strength of character, wit and a little bit of that Disney magic.

df4441e,"While I see your point and agree with some of it, isn't there the possibility of misdirection as well? At some points I found it to look like she was told to do something she wasn't comfortable doing, like as if she wanted to be natural and embrace the character but was told she needed to do something different instead that may not even fit the scene. 

I'll give an example, the scene where she is in her room and the beast is looking at her through the mirror. She's looking up and then after a good amount of time puts her head down into her legs. It seemed like someone told her: ""hey, look up and look around at random things, then seem sad by putting your head down.""

I had hoped after the last Harry Potter film that she would fade into oblivion but thanks to Disney and their Brit fetish, it didn't happen.
Hollywood used to groom talented people and make them into stars that we could look up to and admire. Now, everyone ""starring"" in films looks like they should be asking me if I want fries with that. I'm tired of it. That's why I don't go out to the theater anymore.

I think so much of the complaining and criticizing comes from folks who want so much for the movie industry to elevate their game. There are countless book adaptations that when you read them the amazement flies off the pages, but in movie form they get that all too tempered praise. Same with a lot of these tent pole films.

Are you kidding? First of all, she didn't push him into the mud, she opened the door and he fell into it. Secondly, he was sexually assaulting her. She could have kneed him in the balls and been totally justified. 

>The 1991 version essentially made Belle look more unsympathetic in that argument considering she refused to dine with Beast even after he took pains to try to be polite to her at the servants prodding. 

What? Belle wasn't indebted to eat dinner with the Beast. She only agreed to be his prisoner, not his friend, and it's easy to see why at that point she would have no interest in being pals with him. She knew nothing about him except that he had imprisoned her father. 

>On a related note, I'm glad Belle no longer blames Beast for her leaving the forest, or at least it wasn't treated as a genuine argument (I hated that part, since far from empowering Belle, it made her look irresponsible who is unwilling to admit responsibility for things she caused and wants to blame others for her own mistakes).

This bit is more in the gray area, but I'm somewhat glad that there's now an actual explanation for why the Enchantress cursed the entire staff and not just Beast (even if it was a bit flimsy due to their jobs not exactly allowing them to protest his actions, it still was better than the 1991 version, where she cursed them for absolutely no reason except maybe out of spite). That said, I still think she should have at least spared Chip, Froufrou, Garderobe, and Cadenza, since they were a kid, an animal, and people who weren't even native to France at all, let alone living in the castle.

Now, for some... more unpleasant aspects for the movie:

*LeFou. I'm sorry, but making a character gay in what was supposed to be a children's movie, not to mention outright admitting they did so right before the premiere, was just a stupid move, and was completely unneeded. And it was also inappropriate for the target age range. They really shouldn't have made him gay (besides, he actually showed attraction to the triplets in the 1991 version, there was no way he could have been gay). Him or Stanley, for that matter.

*The anti-intellectualism of the villagers to the extent that they were unwilling to let the women be literate also bugged me, mostly because, 1. the village they were living in was named after the original author of Beauty and the Beast, who was a woman, last I checked, 2., it doesn't really match up with history at all (again, convents and parents taught girls how to read), and 3., it seemed to be added in solely for a social statement. Now, that being said, that was also a flaw in the 1991 film, so it's not much of a problem there, and it did nonetheless make Belle sympathetic, but even still...

*The design for Beast was a tad bit... unfortunate, since he looked like Bahomet. Look, I get it, he needs to look somewhat beastly for the story to work, but at least the 1991 version had Beast looking animalistic without necessarily looking like Bahomet. They could have at least made his tail look like a horse's tail or even a laborador's tail.

*I'm also not particularly happy that Gaston's a war veteran now, because aside from it casting war vets in a fairly bad light, it also made Gaston's begging for mercy to Beast nearing the end make zero sense, since his profession in war would have him encounter PLENTY of things that he would have to face death with little fear holding him back. Then again, that was also a problem with the 1991 film as well when they made him a hunter (since, quite honestly, a guy who has to face death just to kill some wild animals, many of which being dangerous and likely to kill him, not to mention death from not being able to find food, would NOT be the type to beg for mercy since he has to face death all the time).",5zuxzg

I can agree that it did happen quite fast, and since we aren't used to seeing gay relationships, its not necessarily as apparent as to why he switched sides, but it follows a path that is often used to show women turning on a man once they discover the truth he has been hiding about who he truely is.

Using a French accent, especially for main characters, (a pass for Lumiere where it's played for comedic effect how *Frahhnch* he is) would distract and imply that they're speaking in their non-native language or at least a different dialect. The way to avoid that would be to just make the film in French, but then we'd just turn around and dub it over with English voices as almost every country does for children's films.

df5n39l,"Just got back from seeing it and I have to agree. I am glad I saw it, but I wish I hadn't given Disney my money just because it encourages them to do more of this. 

It really fell flat in areas. Not least of which was the lead actress. Emma Watson was great in Harry Potter, but as a lead in a musical film...both her voice and her acting were sub-par. The digital augmentation/assistance to her voice especially in the opening song really set the tone for disappointment. What frustrates me is they could have picked a relatively unknown talented singer/actress that fit the role better but they chose Watson because a big name draws a crowd easier. 

While I had no problem with a gay LeFou, I thought the character was a little much at times. And maybe I'm off base here, but I felt they ""softened"" the character so the gay guy wasn't really evil after all. In the animated film, LeFou was just as evil as Gaston. Which brings me to another issue.

Gaston's personality changed pretty dramatically I thought. At first he is honestly a little shallow, but he even admits that he likes Belle because she has dignity. Then he actually tries to be nice and go along with Maurice to find the Beast and Belle. He snaps a little when they come to a tree that Belle's father swears was just struck down by lightning, but that's understandable I felt. Then out of nowhere he goes pure evil. Leave the old man to die. Just felt rushed.

I could go on, but basically the movie did very little for me. It wasn't bad, but it certainly didn't improve upon the original. Compare this to the recent Jungle Book 'remake' which I loved. What the movie did well was differentiate itself from the animated version. It wasn't better or worse IMO, but it was different enough to be its own thing. And the homages and songs were used sparingly.

I could honestly go on at quite some length about Beauty and the Beast, but I guess if I had to boil it down I'd say this: It was mediocre. It improved upon nothing. Disney should stop casting based on name recognition and start looking for real talent. ",5zuxzg

df5x4kk,"Heh, I have always rooted for Gaston in Beauty and the Beast. And in this re-telling there is even more reason to root for him.

Compare the Prince to Gaston. In this film Gaston is well respected and never seen being a jerk to any of the towns folk. We find out he is a war veteran and officer. He has clearly sacrificed for his town and country. Now let us look at the Prince, born into wealth, the man has never sacrificed for anyone and is even more a narcissist than Gaston could ever be. Both characters have their flaws, but only the obscenely wealthy prince is given a chance at redemption. Was Gaston, from the peasant class, ever given such a chance?

And, of course, what does the horrid Prince receive for his redemption? The most beautiful woman in the region as his reward.  And all of this was orchestrated by the enchantress. She sees to it that Belle's father finds the castle by blocking the trail with a tree and revealing the secret road to him. She allows Belle to find her way to the castle and take her father's place. When Gaston and Belle's father try to find their way back to the castle, the path is hidden from them. At this point Gaston's furry is unleashed and he leave's Belle's father to die in the woods. And who rescues the father? The beggar who later is revealed as the enchantress. How convenient that she was nearby. And how do we know she was not the one to cause Gaston to react in such a violent fashion, triggering flashbacks of the war? You can see in Gaston's face that he appears to be under some kind of spell. This event later leads to Gaston finding his way back to the castle, still in a maddened state under the spell of the enchantress, so as to trigger the sequence of planned events so that Belle will fall in love with the beast. And once Gaston has been used, he falls to his death, silencing him forever and never allowing him to reveal that he was under the control of the enchantress.


This film is a story of classism and class struggle, and the message is clear. The upper classes are allowed to make horrid mistakes, be given redemption, and in turn gain even greater rewards while the lower classes are pawns in their games, made to suffer because the choices of a few powerful people.

Who are his friends that have been punished because of him, but still look after him? By which means would you force Belle and the Beast together? What is the lesson learned? Where does the fun come from? At what point is it no longer Beauty and the Beast?

However, another problem that this introduces is if the village is frozen in time along with the castle. A number of spouses from the castle (such as Mr. Potts and Cosgsworth's wife) are in the village, but when they're reunited at the end of the film no one mentions that they've aged or look different, so then you wonder if only a couple of years have passed or if the village was frozen in time like the castle (only then you wonder how/when Belle and Maurice arrived and why they didn't notice anyone aging) Think it might be a plothole unless Belle and her father only came recently or were allowed into the village by the enchantress.",5zuxzg

df8ili0,"There were subsequent plagues of smallpox and tuberculosis in Paris, even in the 1700's, when the film is set. Crown Prince Louis-Joseph, the son of King Louis XVI of France, died at age 7 of tuberculosis in 1789. 

Inoculation, especially against smallpox, was introduced to the West from the Ottoman Empire in 1714, before *Beauty and the Beast* is confirmed the take place (mid-to-late 1700's). European royals started receiving shots with the ""smallpox vaccine"" as early as 1722. However, France was late to the game when it came to vaccinating their population, which failed to curb the rate of disease.

What's more, this inoculation was introduced by a woman.

> The practice was introduced to England by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. 

> Lady Montagu's husband, Edward Wortley Montagu, served as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1716 to 1718. She witnessed firsthand the Turkish use of inoculation in Istanbul, and was greatly impressed: she had lost a brother to smallpox and bore facial scars from the disease herself. 

> When a smallpox epidemic threatened England in 1721, she called on her physician, Charles Maitland, to inoculate her daughter. She invited friends to see her daughter, including Sir Hans Sloane, the King's physician. Sufficient interest arose that Maitland gained permission to test inoculation at Newgate Prison in exchange for their freedom on six prisoners due to be hanged, an experiment which was witnessed by a number of notable doctors. All survived, and in 1722 the Prince of Wales' daughters received inoculations.

> The practice of inoculation slowly spread amongst the royal families of Europe, usually followed by more general adoption amongst the people.

> [...] In France, considerable opposition arose to the introduction of inoculation, and it was banned by the Parlement. Voltaire, in his Lettres Philosophiques, wrote a criticism of his countrymen for being opposed to inoculation and having so little regard for the welfare of their children, concluding that ""had inoculation been practised in France it would have saved the lives of thousands."".

> Inoculation grew in popularity in Europe through the 18th century. **Given the high prevalence and often severe consequences of smallpox in Europe in the 18th century** (according to Voltaire, there was a 60% incidence of first infection, a 20% mortality rate, and a 20% incidence of severe scarring), many parents felt that the benefits of inoculation outweighed the risks and so inoculated their children.

df1ab04,"It's like a lot of effects. Once you know what to look/listen for, you'll pick it out more easily to the point it sometimes ruins things because you can't unsee/hear it. If it's done well enough, the average audience member won't pick it out.",5zuxzg
df24g39,"Check out the soundtrack on Spotify or wherever. I'm not an expert, hardly an audiophile, but I was really looking forward to this soundtrack and was really displeased about how it turned out to be. Too perfect, too polished. These are the most telling signs of autotune really: it treats imperfections as errors, when they are exactly what makes everything organic.

But if that's not enough, I'll point out some of the more glaring artifacts left over by the autotuning.

Take the song ""Belle"". At around 0:35. Emma sings *""little town full of little* ***pe****ople*"". Can you hear a little distortion when she sings the first syllable of people? It sounds terribly robotic. That's autotune for you. A few seconds later when she sings *""waking up to say...*"", there's another little sudden shift in tone when she goes from ""to"" to ""say"". 

In ""Belle (reprise)"", at around 0:45, when she sings *""I wanted more than* ***I*** *can tell""* - the I sounds really tinny. Not a glaring shift between two notes like the previous examples, but more Emma sounding like a synthesizer.

Let's check out a different song. ""Something There"". Around 0:34. *""he was mean and he was coarse and unre****fin****ed""*. This one is specially bad, I think. You can hear her voice and a second synthetic layer behind it. Few seconds later, 0:41. *""I don't know why I didn't* ***see it*** *there before""*. This ""see it"" bit is pretty bad, there's both the artificial note shift and the robotic-like voice.

I mean, I'll stop right here because once you know what to look for you'll start finding it everywhere. Kind of ruins the whole thing, really. Not to mention the whole production really lacks dynamics, sounding like your average ""loudness war"" record.

This all goes unnoticed if you are entertained by the rest of the movie, I guess. But when wearing headphones and doing nothing but listening it sticks out like a sore thumb.

^^also ^^it ^^bugs ^^me ^^that ^^the ^^Beast ^^sounds ^^like ^^Kylo ^^Ren

EDIT: It's not just Emma Watson, too, which is a pity. Emma Thompson's ""Beauty and the Beast"". Compare how she sounds when singing *""tale as old as time*"" at 2:25 (pretty good) and then again at 2:41 (holy crap auto-tune). I mean, *why do this?!* She's got talent. She *just* sang it well a few seconds earlier. Why distort it the second time around?",5zuxzg
df1fgyo,I don't have a great ear for music but for Emma Watson it was very obvious. Dan Stevens I didn't notice it as much. Probably cos his voice is already altered the entire time to give it that deep growl.,5zuxzg
df1bb61,The beast voice was obviously deep and rumbling but I dont mind it - I thought that's what he suppose to sound unhumanlike,5zuxzg
df1a7fr,I could definitely tell they did some stuff with their voices initially but after a while I didn't notice.,5zuxzg
df1hgia,Yeah Emma I noticed some but Dan sounded great on his solo song.,5zuxzg
df57xyb,"So the thing about auto tuning isn't that it sounds bad it's that it sounds false. If you listen to Watson's singing and the ends of words/verses and where they would hold notes it sounds unnatural. Like it's something you could never hear a person who can actually sing in person. There's nothing inherintantly wrong with it, but when you do a musical it's bothersome to have the leads played by people can't carry a performance. That said they were fine in it just a lot of auto tune ",5zuxzg
df44co7,"She didn't sound auto-tuned to me, but you could definitely tell it was a studio dub. I mean I'm sure that everyone's was to an extent, but there were several scenes (particularly in the beginning) where it was blatantly obvious that she was lip-syncing.",5zuxzg
df64kah,"It's the most noticeable in ""Belle""; it's quite jarring considering they're outside and she has the most perfect electronic twang to all of her notes. ",5zuxzg
dg23r00,"Listen to Gaston in Belle when he says ""I said she's gorgeous and I fell""

On ""fell"", you'll notice it isn't just vibrato making his voice warble, but the autotune is actually splitting his vibrato. When he goes slightly up/down in pitch (which a lot of untrained singers do when they add vibrato), he bends the note enough that the autotune registers some parts as one note, and other parts as needed adjusting. So it creates an unnatural 'warble' that is heard a lot in heavy voice-modification centered art like (personal examples) Imogen Heap or Bon Iver's newest album",5zuxzg

From my otherwise enthusiastically positive comment:

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5zuxzg/official_discussion_beauty_and_the_beast_2017/dfel72x/

*I did not like the insertion of the enchantress into the present.*

*Originally the enchantress was relatively impersonal and never condoned. The adaptation treated her as a relatively benevolent being, but she is a sadistic monster, especially since the curse killed the servants in this version.*

*She rescued Maurice then... never spoke a word in defense when he got accused. Yes Gaston insulted her but that did not justify her silence.*

*They addressed the stockholm syndrome meme on Belle but added one worse - ""We made our bed."" Particularly bizarre to deliver it through Mrs. Potts since her son was inexplicably included.*

*The movie is beautiful, made me cry, a superior adaptation than expected, but bittersweet for this bizarre sympathy for that enchantress.*",5zuxzg

He mentions they are backwards but it's safer there. We see that he had to raise her alone because of the plague and that's why he's afraid to take her back to a big city again. This is all backstory for Belle because he's the one that raised her so she's going to take after him the most. And it shows how young she was when her mother died and why she has an affinity for roses.

With regard to the library scene, I think my issue was that if they were going to make it unromantic, then they had to include more scenes with their friendship developing rather than a rather sudden romance. It felt quite rushed after the song, and therefore not as realistic. Because we know they are going to fall in love, it felt like they forced the romance too quickly as we all know it's going to happen anyway.

Based on the Beast being a Prince, however, and Disney using King Louis XIV as his father in the portrait of his family in the film, the Beast's historically accurate birth name would likely be ""Louis de France"" / ""Louis of France"" (common name) or ""Louis, Grand Dauphin (Crown Prince) of France and Navarre, Duke of Burgundy, Prince of the House of Bourbon, etc."".

You can't say it doesn't add a new perspective on the story the say that it did do this but because you didn't like it it doesn't count.  Also what about the Beast's backstory?

I thought it'd be nice if they'd emphasize the entire helping people in need no matter who or what they are, and not because they might secretly be beautiful or powerful inside.

I'd argue that modern fairy tales could change the moral of the story to: You treat people well because *you're* a decent person (or want to be, or are pretending to be), not because of the attributes of the other person.

You don't help other people because God is watching or the person is a member of an oppressed protected class, or a really powerful person in disguise who might help you get rich and powerful. You help people because that's the kind of person *you* aspire to be.

1. The opening scene where we actually see the Enchantress curse beast wasn't in the original. Also, Belle doesn't teach a girl to read and make the schoolmaster angry...

2. The original didn't mention Belle's mother at all, this did. Belle and the Beast even ""teleported"" to Belle's birthplace in Paris and had a flashback to her mother's death. Totally bizarre and unnecessary, imo.

3. In the original, when Maurice entered the castle, Lumiere was the one encouraging him to sit in front of the fire, sit at Master's chair, etc, and Beast discovers him there and gets mad. There was NOTHING about Belle asking for a rose or anything in the original.

4. In the original, Maurice goes to the townspeople to ask for help and they all question him, even Gaston. Gaston doesn't actually ride with Maurice to the forest or anything, just straight up has him committed to an asylum. I have to admit the timing in the original was a bit weird.

5. Gaston doesn't bitchslap Maurice and tie him up. The character of the Enchantress didn't exist in the original.

6. In the original Beast can't read (for some reason) and Belle has to teach him.

7. There were no mentions of Beast's parents in the original.

8. The character of the Maestro/the piano was non existent.

9. Beast didn't have a solo song, lol.

10. The whole thing with Belle and Maurice escaping imprisonment was way different in the original, where Chip somehow escapes with Belle and operates this machine Maurice invented to hack them out. Definitely less plausible.

-----------------

I'd have to disagree, to an extent. 

Take, for example, Mdme. Garderobe, who is an opera singer. The career field of opera at the time was extremely demanding, and many poorer families and lower-class individuals (including darker-skinned ones) used it as a way out of poverty.

In the similar historical-fantasy production *Casanova*, they had a female black character masqurading as what's called a ""castrato"", or a male singer who was castrated at a young age in order to keep his high, feminine singing voice. 

Castratos were present in the earlier operas, and it wasn't uncommon for them to have darker skin, though the majority were probably Caucasian. They were also known for their ""strange appearances"", and a lot of what involved inducting new castratos involved practices and strict conditions that amounted to near-slavery. Many boys were killed in the process of castration due to primitive medical techniques, and the schedule / training was so demanding that it intended to weed out the majority of those who did survive.

As such, the lower-class status that many castratos came from also included the lower status of darker-skinned people of the time. As noted historically by Casanova, there was also the possibility of women masquerading as castratos as well.

Likewise, Wikipedia says:

> In the 1720s and 1730s, at the height of the craze for these voices, it has been estimated that upwards of 4,000 boys were castrated annually in the service of art. Many came from poor homes and were castrated by their parents in the hope that their child might be successful and lift them from poverty (this was the case with Senesino).

There were also gay castratos, and indeed, castratos were particularly ""maligned"" as having a homosexual stereotype:

> The castrati came in for a great amount of scurrilous and unkind abuse, and as their fame increased, so did the hatred of them. They were often castigated as malign creatures who lured men into homosexuality. There were homosexual castrati, as Casanova's accounts of 18th-century Italy bear witness. He mentions meeting an abbé whom he took for a girl in disguise, only later discovering that ""she"" was a famous castrato. In Rome in 1762 he attended a performance at which the prima donna was a castrato, ""the favourite pathic"" of Cardinal Borghese, who dined every evening with his protector. From his behaviour on stage ""it was obvious that he hoped to inspire the love of those who liked him as a man, and probably would not have done so as a woman"".

So, for those complaining about Le Fou's homosexuality being ""unrealistic"" for the time period, it really wasn't. Especially if he had once been a candidate for being a castrato. ",5zuxzg

That was no accident. And for the record, she may have been justified in doing so, but that was no excuse for smirking like she just told a joke, THAT'S the problem. If they really needed to have her react in any way towards that action, it should have been like [how Goku reacted](https://youtu.be/D4tLVvkNrmY?t=46) when he seemingly killed Frieza out of self-defense (ie, somber, and clearly not happy that she was forced to do that). Or, if Gaston falling into mud was a total accident and not even PLANNED on Belle's part, have her react like Honoka did [here](https://youtu.be/bY2RvvuXabE?t=22) if she defeats an enemy sometimes. Besides, let me ask you something, did Snow White or Cinderella do that to their stepfamilies? Last I checked, they didn't.

>What? Belle wasn't indebted to eat dinner with the Beast. She only agreed to be his prisoner, not his friend, and it's easy to see why at that point she would have no interest in being pals with him. She knew nothing about him except that he had imprisoned her father.

Who said anything about being his friend? All I said was for her to come down to dinner since he asked nicely. It's called ""giving him a chance."" Besides, Cinderella never acted at all like that towards her stepfamily, nor did Snow White for that matter towards the Queen, and they were far MORE of a prisoner than Belle EVER was.

>Again, Belle was right here. Any rational person would run away if a huge monster was raging at them, promise or no promise.

You're missing the point: It's not JUST that she fled the castle, it's that this whole mess started when she broke into the west wing, deliberately, despite even the servants telling her not to, plus her violation of her promise to Beast (and want to know what TRUE strength of character is? It's holding to your promises REGARDLESS of fortune's winds or whether the going gets rough), doing so during a blizzard while WOLVES are on the prowl, among other things. What would have been much better handled is something like, I don't know, Belle and Beast apologizing to each other and saying it was their fault, and insisting it was their own fault before stating they're both screw-ups. You know, like the end of the Simpsons episode ""Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy."" Or hey, how about Ash's apology to Venusaur from the episode Bulbasaur and the Hidden Village? THOSE would have been better, actually HAVING Belle at least acknowledge she was, at least partially, at fault rather than not only blaming Beast for everything, but WINNING the blame game. Let me put it another way: Beast was only guilty of losing control of his temper to such an extent that he smashed furniture. Belle was guilty of deliberately disobeying the one stipulation to her stay in the castle, and violating a promise SHE made to save her dad, meaning she most likely endangered him AGAIN by her fleeing the castle.

That said, I still think she should have at least spared Chip, Froufrou, Garderobe, and Cadenza, since they were a kid, an animal, and people who weren't even native to France at all, let alone living in the castle.

I wish they hadn't tried to justify the Enchantress' actions. The reason they gave doesn't hold up because as servants, they couldn't defy the king. They should have left it like they did in the 1991 version where the Enchantress is portrayed as morally ambiguous rather than benevolent.

I'm sorry, but making a character gay in what was supposed to be a children's movie, not to mention outright admitting they did so right before the premiere, was just a stupid move, and was completely unneeded.

They really shouldn't have made him gay (besides, he actually showed attraction to the triplets in the 1991 version, there was no way he could have been gay). Him or Stanley, for that matter.

Here's what I thought of the gay subtext in regards to Lefou specifically:

Making LeFou gay gave him reason to keep sticking around Gaston so much, and it also gave Gaston a reason to keep LeFou around. As you watch this film it's clear that Gaston is purposefully manipulating LeFou in a way that can't be done with other villagers who love him. The other men in the village like Gaston, but not to the degree that LeFou does. The women just fawn over him. LeFou is a mixed bag. He wants to be with Gaston romantically but, at the same time, he just simply wants to BE Gaston. That's something that makes him stand out among the other villagers and it is also how Gaston uses him in the movie. Those are some of the added layers I think making him gay creates.﻿

About LGBT representation as a whole, especially when it comes to this movie: 

It's not perfect. Not at all. Like I said, it's a subtext and they play it extremely safe. You won't even notice it unless you're made aware of it. This is *not* the peak of LGBT representation in film, nor is it worthy of the controversy it is getting. They could have done so much more with it and kept it a surprise. But, I do feel that it adds something to the film, and representation *does matter*. It doesn't hinder the film at all, but it does add a nice layer to it all.

I hope you like the movie!

Gaston's ""sudden"" switch doesn't seem so sudden when you realize that has been inside him the whole time - that's who he actually is, but he actually is smart enough to know that he needs to hide that person because acting like that isn't socially acceptable. But when he snaps with Maurice, that's him basically deciding, ""okay, I tried the 'nice' route to get what I wanted and it didn't work - time to go to plan B,"" where ""plan B"" is him pulling out all the stops because at the end of the day, all that matters to Gaston is getting exactly what he wants. And it's all downhill from there.

In quotes from an interview going around, Luke Evans details his own thoughts on the motivations and character flaws  he had in mind while playing Gaston: ""He's jaded, and the second he realizes he's not going to get what he wants, this military creature comes out of him."" Luke goes on: ""He's an arrogant, narcissistic, bigoted, chauvinistic, self-absorbed man who, once he's told no, is driven by jealousy and revenge...""",5zuxzg

There is no indication that he is under any spell from the enchantress, and that's nothing more than a huge leap to try to justify your support of Gaston.

>  In this film Gaston is well respected and never seen being a jerk to any of the towns folk.

In literally his first scene, his horse kicks mud at three women interested in him and he scoffs at them, solely because he doesn't find them as attractive or appealing as Belle.  It's one thing to not be interested in a girl, it's another to treat them like shit because you aren't attracted to them.  He then proceeds to look down upon Lefou and manipulate him using his ""best friend"" card to get him to lie about attempted murder (more on this later).  This was immediately after insulting Agatha who was essentially doing him a solid by not saying anything.  Oh, and then he betrays Lefou in the one occasion that Lefou reaches out to him as he needs help in the castle battle.   

>  Was Gaston, from the peasant class, ever given such a chance?

Redemption?  For what?  His only actual failure/problem in life was not having his love returned (which is strictly on a physical level) by *one* girl in town.  Belle and her father repeatedly say that she will never marry him, so his chance for ""redemption"" in a sense is by ramping down his pursuit of her.  Instead, he gets more demanding and more rapey, even though he is blatantly told no (something the Prince never exactly got from what we know of this movie).

> Now let us look at the Prince, born into wealth, the man has never sacrificed for anyone and is even more a narcissist than Gaston could ever be.

While I agree to some extent, the workers revealed that he basically didn't have a chance since he was born.  His mother died and his father took control of him and raised him to be a shitty person; he had literally no exposure to what it meant to be ""good"" seeing as every other person in the house admittedly did nothing to raise him correctly or prevent his father from screwing him up.  That was why they were loyal to him: they realized they were responsible for him being such an asshat.  If you are a kid raised in a castle with one person telling you how to act, how would you at all know you are doing anything wrong?  He's not being told he is wrong to his face like Gaston constantly is.   That was the point of his redemption: he was given a second chance for his father fucking him up, and if it is still impossible for him to turn things around, he is left to live in damnation by himself.

>You can see in Gaston's face that he appears to be under some kind of spell. 

Uh, what?  There is literally no indication of this outside of you wanting this to be a justification for attempted murder and forcing himself on Belle.  If anything, it's the opposite, because Lefou obviously knows whats going on and has techniques on how to calm him down from his temper outburst (""think of your happy place! Think of the war!!"").  Regardless, in comparison to what the prince has done, what Gaston does is on a completely different level of fucked up.  He ties down Belle's father to a tree with the full intention of him dying, so he can get to Belle without the father getting in the way.  What does he do when this plan fails and he gets away with attempted murder?  He attempts to have Belle's father sent to an insanity ward (which back then, is going to be even more atrocious than prison most likely), and then he proceeds to have Belle thrown in as well.

TL;DR: All of your pro Gaston argument is based on a faulty premise, and you overlook the entire story arc of the Prince/Beast.

df2n3on,"FWIW, I think it's pretty clear that the production of the soundtrack was secondary to the sound production of the movie itself. All of the musical scenes in the film were very non-naturalistic. That is, the songs were largely accompanied by visual montages showing events spread out through space and time. And in addition to the vocals, there were added environmental sounds created by foley artists and dialogue captured on set. 

To me, it seemed like they had to compress the vocals quite a bit, just for the sake of clarity when everything was added in, and to make all of the vocalists sound like they were singing at the same volume. That results in diminished dynamic range, which was much more apparent to me than auto-tuning. There's also no sense of auditory space — that is, no indication of where the characters are in relation to each other, or change in sound based on objects or characters moving around on screen, or any kind of natural reverb or resonance. 

To create the soundtrack, it sounded like they just used a subset of the processed audio tracks that were used in the movie, minus all of the environmental sounds and much of the dialogue. If they had used more natural-sounding vocal tracks, the soundtrack might have sounded nicer, but it wouldn't have sounded similar to what we hear in the movie. And that consistency is pretty important for a children's movie. Kids who love the film don't want to listen to a live-recital rendition of the songs. 

In other words, removing a lot of sounds and sonic features from the mix used in the film leaves the soundtrack sounding more artificial than you would expect. But my point is that the whole thing actually is really artificial to begin with. It's not the film version of a stage production, like Les Miserables. It's constructed like an animated movie from top to bottom, that just happens to have some live actors.

On the upside, the overall effect worked a lot better while watching the film than I expected from just listening to the soundtrack. ",5zuxzg

There's room for all types of gay characters, in my opinion. Leads, side characters, ones where relationships and sexuality take a front seat in the narrative and ones where sexuality is just referenced in passing. For me, there's no 'pointlessly done LGBT characters' for this reason.

I haven't seen Beauty And The Beast yes so I don't know just how inconsequential the scene/character is but honestly I don't think it really matters. I know the 'gay moment' has been in the news a lot lately but it seems like it's the media that made a big deal out of it. Every interview I've seen of Josh Gad has him seeming slightly embarrassed about the whole affair. I may be wrong but my expectations have been tempered and I only expect to see the smallest of moments.

There are obviously various issues with on-screen LGBT represention (e.g queerbaiting etc) but honestly I don't see the issue with a characters gayness being a extremely minor facet of film.

The funny (and kinda irritating thing) is that I've seen various people say the gay aspect is tiny/inconsequential/wasn't worth the hype... but ultimately it was clearly a big enough issue for various states and countries to ban/not exhibit the film. 

Edit: Ultimately, I like the idea that my nieces and nephew will be growing up seeing gay characters in media aimed at them even if it's just an innkeeper man that has a husband (as in Frozen).

I mean it wouldn't take much change in plot for Gaston to be the loveable jerk who mends his ways and earns Belle's love.

Just make the following change:  
When the horse comes back after Belle's father being gone, Gaston is still there.  Naturally he accompanies her on her quest.  Arriving at the castle, Gaston battles the beast, and helps Maurice and Belle escape.  That'd be the start of a pretty standard adventure romance, if you think about it.

The Jungle Book was released to a previous generation that didn't have the same immersion of home media, where you could see a film in theaters and then play it endlessly on tape at home (at least not for a couple of decades).

df4co4l,"I could've sworn Disney released the full ""Belle"" clip prior to release. There's only ~ 4 lines sung in the above clip I provided and they're admittedly not as bad as the rest of the song. I poked around and found the [soundtrack version](https://youtu.be/egQbaDRMxGI) (can't seem to find a clip from the actual film, but if you compare the parts with the soundtrack's starting at 0:46, they're the same). I'll list some words/syllables that I hear pitch-corrected and just represent them through capitalized letters:

* Belle's introduction starting at 0:23: There's some notable autotuning in ""liTtle"", ""quIet"", ""EvERYdAY"", ""*PE*op*le*"", ""wAKing"", ""SAaaaAay"". The ""people"" lyric is especially noticeable and makes Emma Watson sound like T-Pain. 

* Picking up in 2:37 after the library scene, there's pitch-correction with ""mY fAaV'rite"", ""*WH*ere"", and ""discOVer"". To be fair, a lot more of the held notes (e.g. ""chapter threeeeee"") in these lines sound like they were left alone.

* In 4:55, almost every word of ""THeRe mUST *be* *MO*re than this provinciAL life"". This is especially noticeable when contrasting against Luke Evans' Gaston, when he sings his very clear ""just watch i'm go-ing to make belle my wiiiiife"". This is the last line the audience hears her sing and apart from ""*PE*op*le*"", it's the most noticeable autotuning in the song.

To show you I'm not singling out Emma Watson, I listened to the entire song and tried to pick out everyone else I thought sounded autotuned:

* The male extra at 0:49 who sings ""bONjOUR"". The pitch-correction here sounds exactly like the one in the clip I showed above (echo-y and tinny), so I know this is the version used in the final film. So why aren't people calling out this male performer for the pitch-correction? Note that this is at the very beginning of the song, the lyric lasts a second, and the autotuning is sung by a character who is neither major nor memorable from an actor who isn't major nor memorable.

* Gaston at 4:01 when he sings ""met heEeER, saw her"" and ""and i fEeELlL"". The way Luke Evans is holding these notes sounds almost like a yodel. I'm a bit back-and-forth on these ones wondering if it's some weird yodel Evans is doing or pitch-correction, but I thought they were worth mentioning.

If you can't hear the pitch-correction, I don't mean any offense by this, but you could possibly be [tone deaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusia). Alternatively, if you haven't taken music theory, music criticism, or choir, your ears are probably less inclined to pick up on the pitch-correction.

I'm not putting down Emma Watson (I actually like her quite a bit) and again, this criticism isn't really directed at her. It's Disney, the director, the sound editor, and everyone else who thought their lead performer should sound like *808's & Heartbreak* was a good idea.",5zuxzg

df6282c,"This is something I really like about the original. Beast goes through a number of stages in terms of his mental state. 

He begins as an incredibly angry, impatient, and very callous individual with little regard for others feelings. We see him take this out on all the servants and Belle. 

As the story progresses, he becomes more gentle and patient, even though his strong personality is still very much there. This is shown through how he interacts with Belle and opens up to doing things out of his comfort zone (having dinner with her, reading, learning to eat with dignity, taking a bath in preparation for the dance, etc). 

In the third act this is completely flipped on its head. All the hope he gained spending time with Belle and changes in his personality he underwent were all for her, and then he believes she's left. This leads to what is very clearly a stage of hopelessness and depression. 

This is shown very well through his behaviour; a song is not needed at all. What was once a previously strong, aggressive personality becomes submissive and despondent. You see this in his body language and facial expressions when Gaston is confronting him, which totally contrasts with everything earlier on. He even basically gives Gaston the opportunity to kill him; he's that mentally broken. 

The song in the remake ***tells*** you this, whereas the animation ***shows*** you (they do it a bit in the film but the contrast is way less noticeable, especially since he's pretty reserved overall in this iteration compared to the animation). Big, big difference. ",5zuxzg

>Who said anything about being his friend? All I said was for her to come down to dinner since he asked nicely. It's called ""giving him a chance."" 

The Beast had just imprisoned Belle's father and only released him on the grounds that she agree to take his place. The fact that he ""asked nicely"" doesn't erase that. 

>Besides, Cinderella never acted at all like that towards her stepfamily, nor did Snow White for that matter towards the Queen, and they were far MORE of a prisoner than Belle EVER was.

Hence why Belle is an improvement over them.

dhg40f1,">I wish they hadn't tried to justify the Enchantress' actions. The reason they gave doesn't hold up because as servants, they couldn't defy the king. They should have left it like they did in the 1991 version where the Enchantress is portrayed as morally ambiguous rather than benevolent.

No, not morally ambiguous, evil. Her cursing children, even if you ignore Adam potentially being 10 since Chip was quite explicitly a child at the time of the curse. And personally, I thought they SHOULD have made her a villain in the original film instead of Gaston (would even be a neat reference to the Villeneuve version of the tale, and it wouldn't be unprecedented to change the villain even if it was based on the Beaumont version since they made Ursula into a villain), and, yes, I personally would have hoped the Enchantress would have been a villain in the 2017 version as well. To be fair, however, the bit about them deserving the curse was from the broadway version.

>Gay people exist, get over it. It's not at all inappropriate for the target age range considering that gay children exist as well. 

Ah, no, there IS no such thing as gay children, any more than there are such a thing as straight children, because they haven't even hit puberty yet, and thus don't have the hormones to even be AWARE of their sexual orientation, let alone have attractions to whatever gender they are attracted to. And for the record, exposing children to that is going to result in a monkey-see monkey-do effect where they'll either become gay themselves or otherwise become gay sympathizers, or do I have to remind you of NAMBLA's mission statement to make kids homosexuals? Besides, womanizers and mass-murdering sadists also exist as well, should we say it's alright to show THAT to kids?",5zuxzg

Beast had more of a history and more interests that aligned with Belle, and generally felt like an actual human of that period despite his beast form, which isn't as true in the animated version. I also longed for ""Crazy Old Maurice"" but I appreciated the alternative take on his character and I think it worked well.

That's...not okay though. That goes on the list of the many things Gaston does that are not cool.

In no way is it okay to continue pressuring and bothering someone and meddling in their lives in the way that Gaston does after they have said ""no."" 

Also...really think about Gaston's actions. Even if Maurice seems like a confused old man and has wasted their time (admittedly frustrating from their perspective), the fact remains that Belle is still missing. But Gaston doesn't seem to care about this - he doesn't continue to actively look for Belle after he snaps at Maurice; instead, he decides to murder the man and then heads home. And think about the song ""Kill the Beast"" - that song is not about saving the people or the village.

(Warning, spoilers) I was also surprising how many of the couples among the cursed palace staff were interracial or mixed race. I actually kind of liked it: you really get to know these characters without any presuppositions about them (besides the clear emphasis on gender) and then suddenly you see that they might not have been what you expected. It was a neat way to play with adult expectations.

If you read my post, I've made it clear that I don't think any of the things they put in this movie would upset children, or even seem like important parts of the movie. However, I think you're discounting just how sensitive children can be--especially since this seems geared towards the Middle-School age-group and up, when kids start to go through sexual changes. I mean, the whole story is about romance. It makes sense for Disney to inject any norms and concepts they might want to imprint on this generation into a movie like this. You can't just get really upset at me and assert that children give ""zero fucks"" and then I have to believe it.

Still, it's a small part of the overall performance and I would say this movie is far removed from a Spike Lee film or other sort of social justice garbage. It's a good movie, even if it's got its head up its own ass about how good it is and that it's a remake.

It seems like the sound editors were faced with the task of making the singing match up to the music. Perhaps the music was changed up a bit in post after the cast had already sung their lines, and they needed auto-tune to make the singing match the new music.

Just the ""fix it in post"" mentality of so many things these days. 

With that being said, the auto-tune doesn't bother me. I like it just fine and it doesn't seem to be that obnoxious - most, like me at first, likely don't notice. 

All audio in every AAA film that DOESN'T feature singing is also heavily processed, and voices are given help by the sound editors in so many ways.

No, my sympathy is NOT for Gaston. In fact, I'm disgusted with him for his deciding to lock up Maurice specifically as blackmail, and would not support him at all. In fact, to be honest, I actually WANTED to see his utterly broken body when he fell off the castle and was annoyed that I didn't see his corpse or the results of the fall, so far from sympathizing with him, I actually wanted to see him die painfully for what he did. But that DOESN'T mean I should praise Belle when she's doing a lot of bad things, many of which are NO different from what she hated about Gaston (and I might as well point out this much, there's acting in self defense, and then there's the fact that she was clearly amused at Gaston being knocked into a mud pool by her own actions, the latter of which casts doubt into self defense, as acting in self defense does NOT have a person acting happy or amused that their would-be attacker had been injured by their actions). And for the record, Lumiere IS a sexual predator (he womanizes, and based on Human Again, he has absolutely NO qualms with sleeping with women who were married to other men, that's sexual predation right there, especially when it's made clear by God that you shouldn't be promiscuous, neither man nor woman should be, that they should be devoted. If anything, I'd argue Lumiere is even WORSE than Gaston, who at least had enough devotion to Belle, even in a more creepy way, to avoid sleeping with the rest of the female villagers.), why aren't YOU denouncing HIM, or Belle denouncing HIM for that matter?

As far as passively ending abuse, maybe I should point out that Jesus himself did things in a passive manner. Did he slaughter the Roman soldiers who came to arrest him and torture him via his divine powers? No! He allowed himself to get nailed onto the cross.

>The Beast had just imprisoned Belle's father and only released him on the grounds that she agree to take his place. The fact that he ""asked nicely"" doesn't erase that. 

By that logic, Belle should still hate Beast even after he saved her from the wolves, and gave her a library simply because of what he did to her father. Let me tell you something: He actually gave a bedroom over a prison cell in that film, and even gave her free access to the areas of the castle barring the West Wing. Usually, prisoners don't even have the right to open doors, let alone explore the place they are imprisoned at, so if anything, Beast practically spoiled her there, especially when Lumiere only suggested he give her a different bedroom, not even that he grant her freedom to explore the castle.

>Hence why Belle is an improvement over them.

So, let me get this straight, a woman who refuses to take responsibility at all for deliberately violating the one rule that she was allowed (and it wasn't even that difficult of a rule: All she needed to do was keep away from the west wing once she knew where it was), is somehow an improvement over people who had enough strength of character to not become utterly psychopathic? Suppose we were going to talk about, say, Jerome Valeska from Gotham, and how he was essentially a slave to his mom and abused. Are you going to claim he was an improvement over Cinderella and Snow White simply because he ""stood up to his mom"", even when it's clearly shown that he's a Joker-esque psychopath?

The only DP who actually came across as an improvement at all to Cinderella and Snow White was Ariel, and even she at least doesn't act like a jerk to everyone. I used to like Belle, but not anymore, not after having to endure several left-wing professors who claimed among other things that women couldn't get an education at all or even be literate until the 1960s (a clear lie, considering I know quite a few women who were literate during that time and even educated).",5zuxzg

She was so powerful and influential a figure, being the ruler / heir of a large portion of France (Aquitaine), as well as a Queen of both France *and* England, that this tradition would take root for the next 700  years in France. She's also depicted on her tombstone as reading a book, and inherited a ""love of arts"" from her father and grandfather.

Yeah, and the Beast holds her prisoner in his house while he tries to convince her to love him for entirely selfish motives.  I think ""rape"" is going a bit far, or my childhood memories of the movie aren't quite complete.  I just remember him putting dirty boots on her table and she doing a lot of eye rolling.

I  really thought them changing him to attempted murder in the live action movie was weird, and out of character for traditional Gaston.  But Disney generally likes their antagonists to be cut and dry clear villains, and this makes him more villainous than blackmailing Maurice with the insane asylum.

>That wouldn't be Beauty and the Beast. It would be an entirely different movie.

df4fa5g,">It seems like the sound editors were faced with the task of making the singing match up to the music. Perhaps the music was changed up a bit in post after the cast had already sung their lines, and they needed auto-tune to make the singing match the new music.

>Just the ""fix it in post"" mentality of so many things these days.

I can understand why they might have done it, but that doesn't mean I thought it was the right creative decision to make. Just the opposite, I thought it ruined all of Belle's songs for me. The point of ""fixing things in post"" is to *fix things* in post, not make them worse. Creative decisions that make things worse for the movie deserve to be criticized.

>All audio in every AAA film that DOESN'T feature singing is also heavily processed, and voices are given help by the sound editors in so many ways. In films that feature singing, the sound editors digitally shift the tone of sung lines here and there, and people go haywire. I just can't relate to the outrage/disappointment.

For me, this isn't about the fact that they autotuned Emma Watson's singing so much as it is that they autotuned it in a way that was distracting and bad for the movie. 

Belle isn't a robot, she isn't T-Pain, and she isn't even in the 21st Century. Having her sound like all of those things when she's supposed to occupy a small town in 18th Century France is bad for the movie. It takes me out of the movie and creates comedy where it isn't intended.

The reason that people don't criticize other big-budget films like say *Dawn of the Planet of the Apes* for having artificial sound design is because *they don't notice* that it's artificial sound design. In *Beauty and the Beast*, you can detect artificial sound design from the very first lines that Belle sings. 

If you aren't bothered by it, that's fine and I'm happy for you that you enjoyed the movie. But reading through the comments in the thread, you'll find that there are quite a bit of people who *were* bothered by it; not because they hate Emma Watson, females in general, or are unfairly targeting Disney for political reasons (or, at least I'm not), but because it's an obvious bit of artifice that they're detecting in the film.",5zuxzg

And, as an aside, I grew up with the original movie (remember seeing it in the theater at age 7) and I definitely think it was a positive influence in my life, being a bookish nerd-girl myself.

It is the exact same situation and it is completely toxic - it's not even about ""feminism"" at this point (not sure where you got that from, just sounds like you're throwing out buzzwords to start shit), it's about common sense and human life. It is not healthy or okay for Gaston to want to force himself on Belle so badly that he's willing to get her dad ""out of the way"" to do it. 

The literal ENTIRE POINT of the film is that you can contrast the Beast and Gaston - yeah, Gaston had the potential to change just like the Prince/Beast did. The difference is, the Beast managed to do it, whereas Gaston simply descended further into his jealousy and rage instead of solving all of his problems by coming to terms with the fact that Belle didn't want to marry him.

I'm also in a very sober and capable state of mind right now, so I would recommend looking at my more recent post as an accurate reflection of my true sentiments.

That movie is such a 6-course meal of a film that it takes awhile to process it. I was anxious so the things I found unsettling jumped out at me first, but now that I've dealt with those emotions the progressive elements of the movie are more properly to-scale with the rest of the film.",5zuxzg

So no, even ignoring religious elements, it's still a bad idea to promote homosexuality as a good thing, especially not to impressionable kids.",5zuxzg
di2ex3z,"The bible never even mentioned black people, however, and it never mentioned autistics either (not to mention in those cases they were actually BORN with those traits, while homosexuals actually CHOOSE to be that. It's similar to those born blind in this case.). That's a big difference from homosexuals, where it DID mention them repeatedly and made it VERY clear that they won't be admitted into heaven, and are considered abominations in God's eyes.

And as far as your other point, true, but the fact that mainstream homosexual rags often acted in solidarity with NAMBLA, as did Harry Hay, the founder of the American gay rights movement, and quite a few homosexual authors outright advocated for pedastry does suggest that a vast majority hold to it. If it was a minority, I'm pretty sure they'd actually be condemning pedastry/pedophilia, not praising it. In fact, I'll just repeat what I told another reddit user below:

""The Journal of Homosexuality, Don Kilhefner's speech to the Los Angeles NAMBLA member on the ""Significance of Man/Boy Love in the Gay Community"", known homosexual authors such as Allen Ginsburg, Larry Kramer, Gayle Rubin, Pat Califla, Jane Rule, Michael Kearns, and Michel Foucault supporting pedophilia in general, Harry Hay, the founder of the American homosexual movement, actually wearing a T-shirt during a 1986 gay parade with the emblazoned words ""NAMBLA walks with me"", and mainstream homosexual newspapers such as Advocate, Edge, Metroline, the Guide, and the San Francisco Sentinel not only supporting NAMBLA, but even having editorials outright advocating for sex with children is not ""nothing."" That was far more than just one example, and many of those, as I mentioned, WERE mainstream.""

I never said that ALL gay people were pedophiles, but they most certainly acted as a majority, which is what matters. And even the ones who may not personally adopt pedophilia as a lifestyle nonetheless explicitly promoted it. I even gave you and another user a full list detailing specific homosexual magazines, journals, and even advocates for homosexuality specifically promoting pedophilia, with one even making very clear that the homosexual agenda REQUIRES pedophilia to function. And considering psychologists are more likely than not going to classify Christians as psychopaths right now, I'd be wary of asking them, not to mention the only reason they removed homosexuality from the DSM-II was because they were essentially cowed into doing so.

They're not at all comparable, actually. As you said, Black people did not rape white people and in fact, due to their also being a strong Christian community, they would have been against any form of rape at all, let alone raping those of a different race. The homosexual agenda, however, outright PROMOTES pedophilia via various literature and journals, and I can even name several key people in the movement who actually promoted such an action, one of whom even went as far as to declare it to be integral to the movement.

Actually, it's because they were cowed into doing so.

I'll even quote his exact words: ""At that point they were afraid to say no to us. So they said yes."" I'll even supply you with the source:

>Mark Meinke. Zapping the Shrinks, May 3, 1971. The Rainbow History Project : Preserving Our Community's Memories.

Perry Brass recalls (in his Come Out article chronicling Gay MayDay and the zap) that six members of GAA were given copies of the statement to be read to the psychiatrists following the disruption of the convocation. …...

So yeah...

>Priests are also strong in the Christian community, that didn't stop some of them from raping little kids, did it? 

Those priests were put in there by people who either wanted their mental ailment cured instead of putting them into an asylum, or otherwise by Communists as a means to take the church down from within via Gramsci's plan.

I've heard of him murdering various white people including children during his revolt, but this is the first I've heard of Nat Turner raping people, and he based his views on Christianity unlike your other examples barring Martin Luther King, Jr.. Malcolm X is a person who adhered to Islam, not a Christian, and was more left-leaning anyways. And Mandela was more than a little bit guilty, and besides which he was a communist and took orders from the USSR until it's fall (heck, there was even a photograph of him and Winnie posing in front of a Soviet Star alongside Joe Slovo, a Stalinist, during a Communist rally in Johannesburg). And for the record, I really wouldn't call people like Al Sharpton or Jessie Jackson actual black rights leaders, since they were more concerned with race baiting to land themselves a paycheck and some airtime over the actual welfare of their race.

And either way, it doesn't change the fact that the Gay Rights people, several key people, authors who were gay, and even some gay magazines outright promoted pedophilia as the way to go, which none of the black rights groups actually endorsed killing or raping white women, period (at least, not the mainstream ones).",5zuxzg

It is not ""hers"" because she did not think of it. It is a UN campaign that she is merely a spokesperson for. Did you listen to the speech? I did. Some things I noticed:

1. The entire ""he for she"" is a sloppy appeal to chivalry. If this is about equality, ""he and she for each other"" would be a good start.

2. Her smiling proclamation that, “For the record, feminism by definition is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities”. If this is true, she did not address why feminists do not work to address issues that favor women at the expense of men, such as primary/secondary school performance and college attendance, inequalities in criminal convictions and sentencing, and so forth. Reading from an unnamed dictionary does not change reality.

3. ""I want men to take up this mantle so their daughters, sisters and mothers can be free from prejudice"". Why does she think that women cannot free themselves? It also implies that women are only victims and men are only perpetrators.

4. ""I’ve seen young men suffering from mental illness, unable to ask for help, for fear it would make them less of a man."" That's great, but how about you talk to men instead of talking about what you've seen. If I were giving a speech about say, the state of children in Peru, I wouldn't base it on what I have personally seen of Peruvian children. Her views are informed no further than her anecdotal experience. And of course, she spoke only to the squishiest issue that men face. No comment about government resources for male victims of domestic violence, for example. How about male reproductive rights? No mention. I suggest if Emma Watson wants to speak to men, she first listen to men. It is obvious that she spent no time finding out about the needs and concerns of men. The idea never even occurred to her.

5. “We don’t want to talk about men being imprisoned by gender stereotypes but I can see that they are. When they are free, things will change for women as a natural consequence. If men don’t have to be aggressive, women won’t be compelled to be submissive. If men don’t need to control, women won’t have to be controlled.” Wow, women have no autonomy according to her. ""Women can only improve if men improve"". My word. Beyond that, Emma, men are parented, educated, and raised by women. Do you think how women raise up boys might affect how those boys react to women once they become men? Could that be even slightly possible?

Do you understand why I don't give Emma Watson extra credit for being pretty while reading?

First off, do you know the original origins of how the AIDS virus spread to humans?

In essense, yes, it's true that it began spreading within the homosexual community. However, that's not to say that if a heterosexual male were the one to be the original carrier, it would have been a ""heterosexual disease"". AIDS/HIV is a blood disease and has nothing to do with someone's sexual orientation. 

An analogy to this would be like saying that Breast Cancer is a woman disease because the statistics are higher with women. Men get it too, albeit not as often.  

Also, sexuality and your definition of it is very dependent on culture. There are many cultures that take part in homosexual relationships willingly while still being fully heterosexual.

In essense, yes, it's true that it began spreading within the homosexual community. However, that's not to say that if a heterosexual male were the one to be the original carrier, it would have been a ""heterosexual disease"". AIDS/HIV is a blood disease and has nothing to do with someone's sexual orientation. 

It may not have much to do with sexual orientation, or even the originator, but it's most certainly most prevalent among the gay and bisexual community. Even the Center for Disease Control made this much clear. I'll even quote them: ""Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) represent approximately 2% of the US population, yet are the population most severely affected by HIV and are the only risk group in which new HIV infections have been increasing steadily since the early 1990s. In 2006, MSM accounted for more than half (53%) of all new HIV infections in the United States..."" This was from their report dated September 2010, which you can read online here: https://web.archive.org/web/20101013202752/http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/msm/index.htm (Original link is gone, unfortunately).

And besides, AIDS and HIV aren't not even close to the only STDs that the gay community is afflicted with through their actions. There's Syphillis, Gonorrhea, Lymphogranuloma Venereum, MRSA, Procitus, Hepatitus, Shigellosis, Gay Bowel Syndrome, and even stuff like anal cancer and parasites. And that's not even counting the other kinds of ordinarily non-fatal diseases that prove fatal to someone with AIDS.

>Also, sexuality and your definition of it is very dependent on culture. There are many cultures that take part in homosexual relationships willingly while still being fully heterosexual. There is no such thing as an ex-homosexual, unless it was originally a paraphilia, meaning a sexual turn on. 

Not true, actually: http://www.conservapedia.com/Ex-homosexuals",5zuxzg
dlwj4hb,"New Testament, and I'm pretty sure it's in the same chapter where Jesus tells them that the pork ban was exempted and said that all things God created are good. Probably also Matthew 15:11. You can also go for Mark 7:18, 1 Timothy 4:1, Ephesians 2:11, Colossians 2:13, and to a certain extent 1 Corinthians 10:25 (though that also deals with meat that bleeds).",5zuxzg
df6k0h7,[deleted],5zuxzg
di4oz0p,"What I meant about AIDS in the homosexual community and ex-homosexuals completely went over your head, but you can throw in as much ""supporting evidence"" as you'd like and it won't change what I KNOW is fact. 

I'll put my second stance in a different wording: Sexual orientation and attraction go hand in hand. To be a homosexual is not to have sex with the same sex. To be a homosexual means to have attraction with the same sex. Are you homosexual if you are attracted to the same sex but have never had Intercourse with them? Yes. In the same way that nuns and priests are still considered heterosexual throughout their life of supposed celibacy. To be an ""ex-homosexual"" doesn't mean not having Intercourse with the same sex anymore (as that would be more like a same sex celibacy), it would have to mean that a person feels no attraction to them anymore. So unless the person was bisexual to begin with and chooses not to act on their homosexual feelings, there's no way to get rid of attraction. That's biological, and sadly, there's been no cure for homosexuality as of yet. A large proportion of children with two same sex parents identify as heterosexual, so your argument about learning to be homosexual by observation is invalid. ",5zuxzg
df6kfdm,What are you trying to say? I don't understand.,5zuxzg
di4pflr,"Tell that to Conservapedia, because they make it VERY clear that homosexuality is a choice, not biological.

http://www.conservapedia.com/Homosexuality_and_choice

So far as there being a large portion of children who list themselves as heterosexual despite same sex parents, let me point out one Robert Lopez, who made it very clear that because of his being raised by two moms, he is actually left VERY confused about his orientation. You can read about him here: http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2012/08/6065/",5zuxzg
di4q0lq,"Nah, I don't have to tell that to a very clearly religiously biased website. Show me something without a religious bias and then we'll see if it's true. 

Also, thank you for giving me an example of 1 person out of the 7.3 billion+ people that live on Earth. One account is hardly statistically valid. To him, yes, that I understand. But to generalize to the whole of the heterosexual children raised by homosexual parents? Not at all. 

I'm not here to argue with you or change your view. It's very obvious that not even Jesus Christ in person would be able to change what you believe is written in a book. Believe what you wish, but please don't shove it down our throats. And for the love of gods, it's a movie. It's not even aimed at children, it's just a movie. ",5zuxzg
dinmj1r,"Why exactly do idiots think being gay is a choice?  I know I'm asking a lot here, but just try and think logically for a moment here.  Why would a straight male who happens to be attracted to women just up and decide they want to start sleeping with guys now?  Just what exactly is it that someone ""choosing"" to do this is getting out of it?  There are literally millions of gay men and women in the world, and you seriously believe that every single one of them just up and choose to be so?  Not because they were born with an attraction to the same sex, but because they just up and decided to be this way?  ",5zuxzg
di4qhtv,"Again, if a person decides not to be homosexual and renounces it, it's a choice. A man can't choose to be white or black. But a man CAN choose whether to sleep with a woman or a man. And God already made it VERY clear that he finds homosexuality to be an abomination, so it's not even up for debate, whether for you or for me.

And actually, there's a whole lot more out there than just him. Heather Barwick's another example, and she also makes clear that there are definitely a lot more examples of children who have been hurt by gay marriages than herself. Statistics even make clear that children who have a mother and father in their lives have far better chances in the world than single parents and/or gay parents. And she's even more relevant of an example, because she had formerly supported gay marriage (you should know her, she wrote the book ""Heather has two mommies""). Read this: http://thefederalist.com/2015/03/17/dear-gay-community-your-kids-are-hurting/

And the only reason I'm even conversing with you guys about this was because you guys tried to shame me just for merely stating that I thought it was bad that they made LeFou gay especially in a family film (and yes, it is aimed at children). I didn't ""shove it down your throats."" In fact, I only dedicated one point out of several to the whole LeFou business (three of my complaints didn't even MENTION homosexuality at all).",5zuxzg
dinpfp9,"Use common sense: if being gay truly was something that wasn't a choice, like some sort of genetic defect, science would have found the gay gene by now. Since it's not genetic, it's a choice. And besides which, you know the term ""ex-homosexual"" exists, right? I can even name plenty of examples of this:

Do people who like certain sports teams have certain genes that makes them prefer those?  You have also yet to tell me what benefit a straight person would get out of choosing to be gay.  Keep in mind that your argument is that a gay guy was born liking women but just decided ""hey, I think I'll start having sex with other men while also being hated by a large percentage of the population.""  So what are the millions of gay people getting as a benefit for making this ""choice?""",5zuxzg
dinn59i,"After the flood, definitely. And I'll even state multiple citations from the bible, both Old and New Testament:

Leviticus 18:22 - You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.

Leviticus 20:13 - If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their blood guiltiness is upon them.

Romans 1:26-27 - For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.

I Corinthians 6:9 (NIV) - Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.

I Timothy 1:8-11 (NASB) - “But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully, realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching, according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.

And for the record, that's not even taking into account the time where God blew up Sodom and Gomorrah (bear in mind, Sodom = Sodomy, and Gomorrah = Gonorrhea in terms of namesakes.).",5zuxzg
dipaemq,"Genes don't determine whether you like sport teams, food tastes, or anything like that. They just determine your dominant and recessive traits such as hair color, eye color, what skin color you might have, possibly your height or weight, any previous conditions you might have had, or something like that, maybe also skillsets.

As far as what benefit it might give them, maybe just the fact that they want to regardless of whether society tolerates such behavior or not. It's the exact same deal for those who choose to get their joys out of tormenting people and decide to do that for their own pleasure even when it would result in them being hated by a large percentage of the population. Besides, in Ancient Greece, most people actually had zero qualms with homosexuality. It wasn't until Christianity came into being that denouncing it as sinful actually occurred. And I might as well add while on that note, there's also plenty of diseases they get from the activity, many of which were even proven by studies by the Center for Disease Control.",5zuxzg

On Punishing ‘Immorality’

Leviticus 20:9

If anyone curses his father or mother, he must be put to death.

20:10	If a man commits adultery with another man’s wife—with the wife of his neighbor—both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death.

20:13	If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death.
Deuteronomy 

22:20-1	If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the girl’s virginity can be found, she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death. She has done a disgraceful thing in Israel by being promiscuous while still in her father’s house.

Exodus 35:2

For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a Sabbath of rest to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it must be put to death.
On Destroying Other People

Deuteronomy 7:1-2	When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nations . . . then you must destroy them totally. Make no treaty with them, and show them no mercy.

20:10-17	When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it. As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. . . . This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby. However, in the cities of the nations the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes. Completely destroy them—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—as the Lord your God has commanded you.
On the Evil of Biblical Law

Ezekiel 20:25-26	I also gave them over to statutes that were not good and laws they could not live by; I let them become defiled through their gifts—the sacrifice of every firstborn—that I might fill them with horror so they would know that I am the LORD.
On Slavery & Subjugation of Women

Ephesians 5:22-24	Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.

Exodus 21:20-21	If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies as a direct result, he must be punished, but he is not to be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two, since the slave is his property.

1 Peter 2:13	Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every authority instituted among men.

2:18	Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh.

Leviticus 25:44-45

Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property.",5zuxzg

dipaukd,"See the other response for the issue with slavery. So far as the above passages, all I can say is that, unless Jesus explicitly states against said punishments, chances are they are to be followed, period, no exceptions.

dipbarf,"The Bible wasn't cool with that, actually. It cited instances where this did happen, but it was not treated at all positively. As a matter of fact, God actually freed the Jewish people from Slavery, and them being enslaved by the Babylonians was treated as a punishment. As for the other portions, they meant ""slave"" as in ""employee"", because that's essentially what they were at that time, where they are to work for a given household or business for a certain period of time.

And no, I may not support homosexuality at all, but that doesn't mean I hate them. Actually, if I hated homosexuals, I'd probably give them ""flying lessons"" a'la the Middle East, or deliberately try to drive them to suicide. Or hey, maybe also support Gay Marriage precisely BECAUSE I'd enjoy them having an agonizing demise from STDs from their activities as a result.",5zuxzg
