g3y8g56,"The movie was more interesting than it was good.

The inverted time stuff was cool and the scenes showing it off were awesome. But the plot around it was uninteresting and kinda generic, which was a huge disappointment.

The acting was good. Denzel's son, Pattinson and the tall blonde(Debecki?) did well.

The writing was pretty questionable. Some bizarre clunky lines.

They didn't want to commit to a romantic relationship or spend time explaining or developing a close bond/friendship between Washington's and Debecki's characters. So it felt bizarre that he suddenly was so committed to protecting her.

The final climatic scenes were confusing and hard to follow.

-really cool concept, the idea of going forward and backward through time and seeing fights that have already happened but in reverse and stuff like that.

-cinematography and effects were fantastic

-the plot itself was honestly a bit boring tbh, most of the first half was taken up by exposition dumps purely to keep things secret and confusing.

-sound mixing was horrendous. Was quite hard to pick up on dialogue at points and none of the conversations had any real meaning until the very end. Like I said, lots of exposition and shallow conversations.

-so confusing I need to go watch it five more times.

Still processing overall. Not Nolan’s best work, but certainly leaves you so bamboozled you want to watch it again. 7/10",im7etj

g3xvw3w,"I'm like 85% sure that Nolan had the idea for the one scene with half the building exploding while the other half comes back together and then just wrote this movie around it. And I think it was kinda worth it, because that scene was incredible.

I liked most of the performances, and the core concept. I definitely want to check it out a second time, because I feel like I missed a good bit of what was going on. Like I could always follow the big picture, but a lot of the individual scenes were kinda nonsense because of the sound. The kitchen fight and the car chase scenes were awesome. I actually didn't really care for the final action scene, but the shots of the building explosion I mentioned above were worth the price of admission on their own.

I really wish Nolan would put aside his weird sound mixing thing. I've literally never seen another movie in theaters where I couldn't make out the dialogue, but its now happened three times in a row for him. This really shouldn't be that hard.

My initial reaction is that I liked it but didn't love it, its a 7/10 for me. I'm open to revising that rating in either direction after seeing it again. I'm sure there's some cool stuff hidden that I missed on this watch, but I also bet there's some stuff that makes no sense when you give it a second thought.",im7etj
g4awrzx,"Minor detail I really loved about the Freeport scene. When Blue Protagonist and Blue Neil are wheeling Kat into the burning building, Neil periodically looks over his shoulder.

He was more concerned with playing with his bag of tricks than he was with telling a good story.  Clearly not enough thought was put into the characters, who are all paper thin and I don't care about any of them.  The dialogue was unremarkable at best, unintentionally hilarious at worst.  Lines like the much maligned ""including my son"" were obvious attempts to cram in an emotional core that clearly just was not there.

That said, Nolan at his worst still managed to do some things right.  The visuals were cool and the plane crash happening in reverse was an awesome sequence.  I'll give it a 6.5/10.",im7etj

g3yo8gc,[deleted],im7etj
g3zwfk5,"I would just like to quickly reiterate what quite a few are saying about the inaudibility of the dialogue before moving to my larger points. I know we were in for it when I couldn't understand bits of dialogue in the two scenes (opera and trainyard) before the title card even appears.

This is a towering movie with the set pieces and locales, and the sheer scale was impressive to see in a movie theater.

However, if you've got me for 2 hours and 30 minutes, then you've got me for 2 hours and 45 minutes.

Take the time and give me two minutes filmed in medium close up and close ups (or, at least, not at such a far, voyeuristic distance as the scenes outside the school were shot) of some wholesome exchange with Elizabeth Debicki and her son. I want to *feel* that she cares. Debicki does a great job emoting, but she has to do too much of it through dialogue. What if there were even a scene where she protects her son from the abusive father, Satir? Nolan did a good job establishing pathos between Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy (young daughter) in INTERSTELLAR, so I know he's more than capable of this.

What's happened to the dashes of wry humor in Nolan's previous work? Take the time and give me light banter between John David Washington and Robert Pattinson à la Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy in INCEPTION. JDW and RP had great chemistry; lean into that!

Even the first Nolan film to be described as ""constant climax"" (THE DARK KNIGHT) had room to breathe. This needed that desperately.

JDW's character's name is The Protagonist? Is Nolan really using his $200 million high-concept espionage thriller to make some kind of metacommentary? There are shades of what he wanted to accomplish with DUNKIRK, which he said ""abandons the conventional ideas of backstory and dialogue to explain why we should have sympathy for a character."" He didn't want the soldiers swapping stories about being back home, ""I miss my girl,"" etc. Now, that might work for an impressionistic war film, where we obviously want the protagonists (the Allied forces) to win. With TENET, though, we don't have that framework. You have to give us more than a ""Protagonist.""

Finally, does anyone else realize how unrealistic it would be for some of the inverted pieces to play out with no one else seeing them? Like, an entire fleet of boats traveling backwards? lol",im7etj

g3xsafu,"Where to even start here. There's good things, cool things, bad things, seemingly obviously flawed things. Like Interstellar this movie is just so many things that boiling it down to a review seems overwhelming. I found my thoughts while watching to be very contradictory, like I couldn't even decide if I was enjoying it or not.

First off, I'll just admit it, I didn't really get this movie. I understood the concept behind the time manipulation and how it came into play, but I had a really hard time making sense of the plot or what the major goals were scene to scene. It felt like there was just a general goal and endless bad guys working against them. I assume Branaugh was just ""private military"" rich but it's never really explained.

I think my main issue with this film is that when there's fighting happening and the concepts at play I'm on board, but whenever those things aren't happening I wanna jump off the boat. I enjoyed the Bond vibe they were going for but the first half of this movie is almost entirely made up of characters explaining things to the protagonist, or us. There's no real detective work happening other than just finding who knows more and convincing them to tell you over drinks, no cool spy stuff like dropping tails or espionage. Even that scene where the doctor explains the concepts was overall just a lot of really cliche trailer bait lines. And it feels like she's giving him a super power, but it's one that's mostly out of his control and is almost never used.

Speaking of the protagonist, I thought Washington did fine in this but could his character have been written any more boring? Despite a quip here and there he was not really especially intelligent, brutal, cunning, or charming. He was pretty everyman which is weird because he was painted as some sort of special savior. He was a capable fighter who could understand things that are explained to him, that's not really a character worthy of holding up this movie IMO.

I will say that I didn't find the sound mixing to be a huge problem, although there's some obviously flawed decisions like having important conversations while a boat is going full speed. But even with believing I caught most of the dialogue every conversation seemed to be a jumble of hot words like plutonium, Sator, future, algorithm, etc. They explained the plot so often that I didn't have trouble following it, but the minutia of it seemed so unimportant they really didn't need to spend so much time telling it to us.

But, when the movie wants to be cool it has its moments. The dude getting his face grated, the hallway fight from both perspectives, the literal handful of times the movie had an ounce of humor, I especially enjoyed the car chase scene and I will say I think Elizabeth Debicki is the standout here although none of them were working with great dialogue. But even with all that I still didn't feel like this movie took the time concepts to their limit. I feel like in Inception he really pushed those ideas to the brink of madness. Whereas here the concept is simple enough and once you see it put to use the movie doesn't have many surprises in store. I kind of wish we got that climax scene of the storm on the facility from both forwards and backwards perspectives, one after the other, because I was having an especially hard time seeing how the forward benefitted the backward.

Overall, I definitely didn't hate this movie. I have a strong urge to watch it again to try and catch all the ins and outs I probably missed, but I have an equally strong urge to not sit through all the dialogue again. This is a 6/10 for me. Pretty solid concept and I could really see a lot of people watching this movie and finding nothing wrong with it, but for me there were too many flaws to ignore.

/r/reviewsbyboner",im7etj
g3yppe6,"I'm glad to see everyone trashing the sound mixing, the dialogue, the characters and the final act. But for me the most disappointing thing about the movie was that they never really used the inversion concept in any meaningful way. The protagonist never catches anything outside of the first exposition thing and a gun in a fight scene. Outside of a few people running backward and some explosions played in reverse, replacing the inversion with a time machine would not change the overall plot of the movie at all.",im7etj

It was a fantastic showcase of why theaters are the best place to watch films, but that’s all it felt like: a tech showcase.

g43ynkg," 

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Tenet. The story is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of time travel physics most of the plot will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also The Protagonist's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these scenes, to realise that they're not just clever- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Tenet truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the complexities in Kat's existential catchphrase ""INCLUDING MY SON,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Christopher Nolan's genius wit unfolds itself on their movie screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Tenet tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",im7etj

g3y2itz,"I feel like the film could have been incredible if it gave The Protagonist and Neil some personal, emotional stakes.  
They had the Elizabeth storyline to inject some emotion and personal stakes into the movie, but that really should be taken care of by the main characters.  
It’s like if, in Inception, Arthur was the one with the dead wife and Cobb was still the main character.

g3xyx26,"I went and saw this the other day. It was my first time in a theater since Onward and I was really excited. Inception, TDK, and The Prestige are some of my favorite movies. 

It made me so sad to admit I did not like this movie. Granted, I'm sure if I watch it again with subtitles I will enjoy it more. There was just SO much exposition everywhere that I am not ashamed to say I couldn't keep up. And I didn't think the sound was the issue, just the pure volume of information being vomited out the entire film. 

When it clicked that the movie would be revisiting scenes with our time traveling characters interacting with themselves, the movie definitely got more interesting. But I couldn't help but think, ""Man, that was a LONG, CONFUSING journey to get to a twist that's been done many times before."" 

In hindsight I can say I understand the movie in general, but it was a rough road getting there. I didn't think the inverted scenes were cool enough to make up for all the bland exposition. It's been said many times before, but the dialogue was bad and the last scene felt like a paintball match. 

Pattinson stole the show. The movie should have focused on his character and his relationship with the protagonist more... Then the end of his character would have had more weight for me.

gf9893l,"The Biggest Logic Fail is this:-

The future humans have decided to kill the present humans & reverse what present humans did to the planet.

They believe that by doing so, it won't affect their existence (Grandfather Paradox) or even if they're not sure, they still want to take chance as their life is already fked up as Earth in the future is not so habitable. Fine!

They can have either of these Two Outcomes :-

1. Once they activate the Algorithm, the past humans will be destroyed and the Future humans too will cease to exist instantly because they killed their ancestors and henceforth cannot have been born.
2. Once they activate the Algorithm, the past humans will be destroyed and the Future humans will continue to exist as the 'Grandfather paradox' doesn't apply.

They are prepared for Option 1 (To die)And if they are lucky i.e. Option 2, they survive.

My point is: If nothing will change, then even the climate/habitat won't change.  If they have negated the effect on their own existence, the effect on the climate will also stay negated.

The movie suggests that by Option 2, Future humans' existence won't change but the climate/habitat will. How ??? WTF!!! Seriously?

Then for some reason after that just decided not to use any of the other bullets in his gun to go ahead and shoot the Protagonist anyways? He aims at Protagonist, shoots inverted Neil, then forgets to shoot the protagonist. 

If he doesn’t know about inversion, which I’m pretty sure he does, his boss says hey go bury this plutonium with a massive explosion in some Russian mining town.

ggfxfi8,"Gave it a second watch today, and I expected some of the knowledge from the first watch-through to grant some explanation and make it a better viewing the second time around, and it really didn't.

On my first watch-through, I was really disappointed by the lack of explanation given for phenomenon. Literally, the first time the Protag asks someone ""how does this work"", and they tell him ""don't think about it"". I feel like that is the underlying motive behind most of the writing throughout the film: not that there is some reasonable explanation in the writer's mind about how things work the way they do within the movie, but that they just want the world to just move and work a certain way and their viewer's desire for explanation is just not important enough for dialogue.

I feel that this movie drops from ""cerebral thriller"" to ""poorly explained special effects cash-grab"". They milked the sh\*t out of the moving forward//moving backward effect, even blowing up a building in two different ""directions"" back-to-back. Cool. But the explanation for things was like ""quantum science genius-babble"" at best and.... ""just dont think about it"" at worst.

In the final climactic battle scene, I kept thinking ""who are they fighting?"" and ""why do they never show who they are fighting?"" It seems like the soldiers are just shooting stuff: buildings, rocks, windows... and the whole plot item of ""The Algorithm"".... what the hell is that? It has 9 pieces, but he has 8 of them already, and if you assemble it, the world's time is reversed and... the universe ends? But not when it is assembled, but when the bad guy dies... And somehow people in the future are sending things back in time? And there was a war in the future that somehow sent ""detritus"" back to the past? And also people? What are the rules of this?

Everything Ludwig Göransson touches is gold.

Nolan's hand-to-hand action scenes have improved immensely since the days of the Dark Knight trilogy.

Never heard of Dimple Kapadia before, but she is gorgeous. I hope I look even half that good when I reach her age.

I didn't really buy the idea of a romantic relationship between the Protagonist and Kat, so I'm glad they never went beyond a chaste kiss on the cheek (although I do like a good tall girl / short guy couple).

Cons:

The sound mixing. Holy. Shit. I thought there was something wrong with my theater until I saw this thread.

I thought the pacing was off. We would have scenes where characters are spouting their dialogue like it's a race, the story jumping to a different continent without explanation, and then everything coming to a screeching halt so Elizabeth Debicki can monologue about motherhood.

Some of the dialogue is not great. Some things are over explained or under explained, Kat gets some cringey lines and everything Sator says is a cliché.

The final battle is a mess. They cut back and forth between the red and blue teams too quickly to really keep track of what is happening and when. And we see maybe a handful of Sator's henchmen? It seems like they sent two armies to take out six dudes. There are some cool moments - like the blue soldier getting sucked into a wall - but it's mostly very muddled.

Hard to say overall. It's a really cool take on time travel with some solid action scenes, but the sound mixing is so, so bad. And when you have a movie with so much exposition you can't really afford to make so much of the dialogue unintelligible. The more I think about it, the less I like it.

g3xvq9w,"The action scenes, the soundtrack and the sound effects were amazing. The plot and writing were so slow at times and hard to understand at others. John David Washington’s character was so stoic through the whole film. We rarely see him crack a smile or come across as human with a backstory showing his reason for being badass. Robert Pattinson’s character was a little intriguing at times and cheesy at others. Elizabeth Dabicki’s character was really good but the “my son” longing seemed a little stretched over and over again. I couldn’t see Michael Caine or Kenneth Branagh as just them as actors so it was hard to fully emerge with their scenes. I sat through the whole movie and I can’t really explained what was going on with the backwards stuff or even what the movie was about. It wasn’t a bad movie but I’m not dying to see it again anytime soon. Maybe an interesting concept but difficult to pull off?

g4s01uy,"I wanted to like this movie so much, but couldn’t. It was convoluted and worst of all, boring. Inception is one of my favorite movies and this had none of what made that movie work. Mainly the characters. I didn’t really ever understand JDW’s motives. He was only the on the nose “protagonist.” Like, seriously? I mean, saving the world is a noble cause, but I should care more about you doing so. 

Is it even possible for Kenneth Branagh to play a character without an over the top accent? Michael Caine as a cameo is fine and Pattinson was pretty good - maybe even a standout. I didn’t care about the woman that was so central to the movie. Not really at all. She wasn’t interesting and was shoed into an abusive relationship to protect her son trope.

I did appreciate the lack of cgi and some of the thought that went into pulling certain things off, but it didn’t make up for how confused I was.

Why was a “time bomb” kept being referred to as an algorithm. Did no one not know what algorithm means? An algorithm in physical form or pieces makes no sense. I feel like Nolan thought “Bomb” wouldn’t be cerebral enough.

It was like a game trying to put the pieces together of what was going to come back later. The lady diving off the yacht? Same woman who saw the lady diving off it. Neil stops mid chase after pulling the mask off the antagonist? Because he realized it's the protagonist. In the siege scene when the Protagonist gets saved by an inverted bullet?

g3ysu1a,"This film, in my opinion, was god awful from start to finish. The problems: 

\-we are not given a single reason to give a shit about any of the characters or the success of their mission, apart from the boring, usual, 'if we dont do this the world is gunna end' bullshit

\-because we ultimately have no character development, and no reason to give a shit the whole film, there is absolutely **zero tension** the whole movie. Why should I give a shit if 'the protagonist' is going through an inverted gunfight if I know, pretty much for a fact, that the world isn't going to be destroyed and there are no other personal stakes for me to care about. Sure, 'Kat' might be out to save her child, but why should I care? 

\-the dialogue felt incredibly *fast* throughout the whole film. Each exchange of dialogue was so rapid, with quick cuts, that you literally aren't given a second to digest anything. It felt like a YouTube vlog the whole movie. I mean, jesus, give a character some TIME to digest what's being told to them.

\-This last point also relates to the pacing of the film. This film moves at a lightning fast pace. With each new scene, the protagonist is in like an entirely new situation and even part of the world. Given the already 'high concept' nature of the film, this jumping around locations at a lightning pace just overwhelms and confuses the audience.  

\-the sound mixing was also terrible. My friend said that it would've been better to see it with subtitles on, and I agree, because there are so many instances in the film where you simply **can't understand what the characters are saying** 

\-the central concept, 'tenet' (or whatever time inversion shit the word is supposed to represent) isn't properly explained, and is barely used for the whole movie. It's kind of just chucked in whenever they need a cool scene

\-the last 30 minutes of the movie was just horrible. There was rubble, explosions, screaming, inverison shit happening. There was just so much nonsense on screen that it was hard to follow, and once again, **no tension**, because there were no stakes. Like, obviously they're gunna succeed in not setting off the fucking doomsday device. 

\-I love how like, 3/4 into the film they're just like, oh shit yeah, Andrei has cancer. So that's why he's doing all of this. Cause if he dies he doesn't want the world to exist because he can't be in it. Like ok? what a terrible way to reveal a villain's motives, and what a shitty motive it is

\-There are so many other problems, but the main thing is I just left the theatre feeling confused, bored, and unfulfilled. There's no relief in the audience when the characters succeed in the mission, the only relief is being able to get the fuck out of the theatre.",im7etj

gi0nb65,What did I watch? Haha,im7etj
g3y8hlo,"OK, just saw the film and here is what I am struggling to understand:

>!spoiler!As I understand it the final act of the film revolves around Tenet trying to retrieve the algorithm from the underground bunker before Sator kills himself and the explosion goes off at 10:00, burying the algorithm in a time capsule. When Sator dies, his deadman's switch will broadcast the GPS position of the algorithm so that the antagonists in the future can excavate it and use it to reverse all of entropy, thereby ending the past. Tenet needs to get to it first so they can hide it, thereby preventing the future antagonists from using it to end the world.
So... why does Tenet need to retrieve the algorithm BEFORE the explosion and before Sator dies? Can't they go back to the spot literally any time after Sator's death, dig up the algorithm, and hide it? Granted it would be a lot more work but Tenet has the advantage of time on their side. Priya says the algorithm is invented ""many generations from now"" so it's not like the antagonists can invert and go back 100's of years to retrieve it, they would die on the way. They can only dig it up in the future.
Maybe I'm missing something but I'm struggling to figure out where the sense of urgency comes from in the final act.",im7etj
g3zjc2o,"Just got out of an IMAX screening.

Mixed emotions. As I'm watching the movie, I have enough awareness to say, ""OK, this is confusing / I am confused."" In that sense, I was frustrated. I tried to just let it slide (""don't try to understand it, feel it"" well I took that to heart), but it made some of the action and set pieces harder to appreciate as I was trying to make sense of it in real-time.

Otherwise, the movie really is a technical marvel and I'm glad I watched it in IMAX. Seeing the second POV fight scenes were terrific. Still, in terms of ""awe"" -- I think Interstellar achieved that better for me and was more emotional for me since I felt for the characters. This movie, however, is *very cold* with little in the way to connect to them. Builds off similarly to Dunkirk, but I didn't mind it as much in that movie. Frankly, I didn't mind it much either here but it is worth noting nonetheless. Also, I thought it was really silly to just have Washington's character named The Protagonist (minor gripe for sure and I knew that ahead of time).

I had to watch an IGN explainer afterwards which frankly did a great job and it made me definitely appreciate the movie more. I need to watch the film a second time, but it does bring up the question of the quality of a movie if a second viewing is required to appreciate it and in my opinion, if one is needed I think that is a negative and fair criticism of said movie.

The audio is terrible. I'm appalled and flabbergasted that the movie made on screen without having that addressed. Big negative and I give no pass for Nolan -- the same has been said about his previous films so why the hell does he still do this lol? And finally, the end of the movie is really abrupt. I could tell the audience was put off by it in my theater and frankly it was a bit underwhelming. I did enjoy the soundtrack overall though.

I really, really, really was looking forward to this film. That being said, this is a B/B+ for me which is mainly saved by the technical and sheer balls of Nolan going for it so to speak. Whereas I have reached plenty of Nolan's past films multiple times (not Dunkirk though), this one may got only a one more viewing for me at a later date.

Edit: I wrote the above on Monday after watching it. Since then, I have watched a pirated version and realized two things: first, I appreciate the action scenes even more; the dialogue is still clunky; the first hour is almost all exposition and there's nothing really interesting nor redeeming about that part. Finally, it has to be repeated -- the car chase and the Airport fight scene were the highlights and it kept me on my toes. The rest of the movie has a lot to be desired for. I came out saying B/B+, and then saying B+ and I will stick with that mainly for the sheer balls to go for a movie like this.",im7etj

I can deal with a movie that is lacking in character development. I know perfectly well that character is not the alpha and omega of film, or indeed any dramatic or narrative form.

I can deal with a movie where much of the dialogue is unintelligible. I like Robert Altman.

I can even deal with a movie that has a convoluted temporal structure and little explanation. I love *Primer*: great little movie.

But *Tenet* asked me to go through all of that for-- dullness. The story was dull; the spectacle was unremarkable; the music was a plod.

The pacing/editing the first part of the movie was just not good, this is kind of a thing Nolan does where he jumps from place to place without showing action in between, but in this case it was just straight up confusing and I really didn’t feel like he gave the viewer any time to get a grasp on the characters or the situation that was unfolding. It took a lot of guesswork to piece together who and what we were dealing with. This really left me feeling like I wasn’t fully immersed in the action scenes because I was still trying to figure out why the action was taking place rather than being able to get swept up in it, I wasn’t holding my breath to see what was going to happen because I didn’t know what was happening.

I just feel like the whole plot that the future had to destroy the past didn’t really make sense to me, among other things. It really feels like a cool idea that I don’t think was presented right.

Also, the idea that Nolan signed off on the sound-mixing in this film is so appalling lol. It's a movie where you need to hear every line of dialogue to understand the concepts being thrown around. The fact that you can't understand most of what's being said is so mind blowing to me.",im7etj
g7bxzhy,"This is the first Nolan film I left the screening feeling largely dissatisfied, and I really wish that wasn't the case.

The actual idea for the movie, narratively speaking, is genuinely great. And when we got our first major inversion scene on the motorway I was pumped for what I thought would be the whole movie again in reverse, with clues paid off, emotional turning points, and a satisfying finale.

There was some of that, kind of... but the whole movie was just so unclear and dull leading up to that point that I didn't even care by the time the fun stuff started. The sound mixing issue has already been spoken about at length, but I honestly think Tenet makes a strong case for why some films actually need test screenings. I think WB seeing that 99% of the audience had a problem with the audio would have raised some major red flags with them.

I also think it's weird for a film that asks you 'not to think about' the internal logic that it spends almost an hour devoted to nothing but explanations. Fast cutting does not make a scene any more interesting when you're just being assaulted with emotionless exposition. I think the cast really salvaged this experience for me, JDW and RP had a fun back and forth, and I even found the sheer absurdity of Branagh to be quite fun at times. It also seems Nolan has promoted the dead wife character to an alive abused wife character instead, so that's progress for him I guess?

All that said I feel like people will give Tenet quite a hard time (myself included) because Nolan has set the bar so damn high for himself. For any other filmmaker the flaws of this film could easily be thought of as its charms, and perhaps they will in time, but it's hard not to feel bitter fresh out the theatre.

g4t7bnn,"Didn't like this movie, I'm sure a big part is because I had mile-high expectations going into this one.

Could not follow the dialogue at key moments, the archetype of this being the opening action sequence in the opera, when most of the lines are given through a Bane-type mask.

Could not follow the chain of causality because I could not understand what was going on due to inability to understand the dialogue.  I would have gleaned as much from the movie's plot had the movie been muted.  

Could not follow the chain of causality because the core premise of the movie seems to be that there is no chain of causality.

Loved Elizabeth Debicki in this, Robert Patterson was pretty good, John David Washington was pretty good as a Denzel-type Equalizer CIA agent, but IMHO such a character felt starkly out of place amongst a bunch of Brits in what is better compared to a James Bond type movie than anything American.  Michael Caine is IMHO too much of a presence in most Christopher Nolan movies to be effective in a cameo role, case in point is how he's ranked higher in the list of cast members than the main villain of the movie, even though he has maybe 5% the screen time.

Pacing was frenetic, and in a movie like this, that's a problem.  This movie has a lot of elements of a blockbuster action thriller, and Christopher Nolan's signature focus on novel themes and approaches.  Unfortunately these two elements are naturally at odds with each other, as a blockbuster action thriller's main draw is that you shut your brain off (think Transformers), whereas most Nolan movies require a strong attention span.  Inception walked this tightrope extremely well.  TeneT on the other hand fell way too far into the Transformers type pacing.

Action was superb, the premise is very interesting, but IMHO the execution reminded me too much of the Dark Knight Rises, which I've liked less and less to the point of outright dislike for many of the same problems TeneT has.",im7etj

The issue was and maybe it's just me that struggled with this. I found the plot quite difficult to follow. There were really cool action scenes but I struggled to understand the film as a whole. The characters certainly didn't help. I didn't feel connected or attached to any of them and the screenwriting didn't really feel like it was engaging. I'll probably give it another shot as I'm reading here that once you've seen it once the film makes more sense.   


Personally, I don't know if I just couldn't even comprehend this type of film and maybe it isn't for me for that reason or if there are actually things in it that don't make sense.

But when the movie gets to what someone else has dubbed as the ""blue and red rooms"" scene, the pacing gets insanely better, things start to make more sense, and it got really, really good. I still couldn't hear a lot of the dialogue, but I caught enough that I understood most of what was happening. 

I thought Robert Pattinson was phenomenal, but it felt like John David Washington was just reading a script. Also, I didn't not feel any chemistry between him and Elizabeth Debicki, so his character's weird obsession with keeping hers alive didn't make sense and I questioned it often throughout the movie.

Also thought the exposition in this is easily his most playful and energetic yet and honestly kinda great to see Nolan himself not caught up in the details of what's going on (I doubt even he fully understands the movie) and instead just using the exposition to really only set-up actions scenes rather than explain every detail in the world.

The only hint of exposition he got was dropping the bullets and catching them in his gun. Everyone just knows everything they need to, including him, and the viewer is left like “what the fuck?” The entire art forgery plotline has no bearing on the outcome of the movie. It’s fluff so Nolan can say he ran a plane into a building. 

It’s fun to watch but extremely not fun to understand. Probably wouldn’t rewatch it but a second viewing would be good to reveal how the entire movie basically loops back around on itself. The juxtaposition of things happening on screen that you don’t realize are part of the inverted loop to be revealed later on is nifty - the Protagonist inverted in the sedan on the highway scene, the airport fight, even the Humvee driving out during the final fight are all cool little *twists*.",im7etj

Maybe a lot of people here expected more profound characters or themes, like in many past Nolan movies. I think a worthy trade was made sacrificing some of the depth of previous masterpieces for, in my view, cool shit.

Yeah, the characters aren't remotely as interesting as in, say, The Dark Knight, and there are certain things that just fall apart upon closer examination, even on my first watch. ^(Christopher Nolan, like, *half*-gives a fuck about physics. One thing I noticed: The whole ""if you touch your past self you explode"" thing is a trope that doesn't make sense given the fact that the particles that make up our body are always changing; if that really mattered, you would explode as soon as you got inverted and touched ANY regular matter. Anyway.) I mean, it's not really worth taking apart because it was done to serve the plot.

That said, I thought the action was WAY cool. Whatever you may think of the plot or the characters or ""temporal pincer formations"", they set up the action scenes really well. I feel like I shouldn't have understood them, but the way ""inversion"" worked was explained in a solid, gradual way. You see a fight between two people, one inverted, THEN a car chase involving inversion, THEN a large-scale military ""temporal pincer"" raid.

g4522zr,"One more comment because I wanted to address something that people are saying about the **lack of thematic or emotional richness in the film**. I don't necessarily disagree but I think people might be looking in the wrong place.

Firstly, a very popular reading of Nolan's more personal films are that they are fundamentally about filmmaking. To give a few examples:

* **The Prestige** is all about the difference between the mechanics of a trick and it's presentation. The point being that the reality of a trick is often disappointing or even dangerous, but the magic is in the way it's presented. It's interesting that the film (arguably) sides slightly more with Borden, who is more of a technician than a showman.
* **Inception** is probably the most obvious allegory, with the main plot thrust being about assembling talented people who can place an idea into a person's mind, and the complicated steps one has to take to achieve such a thing, including building a world and inhabiting it.
* **Interstellar** mirrors Nolan's insistence on the craft of filmmaking itself, with our protagonist being an old-fashioned believer in the transcendent power of science and space exploration, just as Nolan himself believes in 'old-fashioned' practical effects, analog cameras etc.
* **Dunkirk** is actually very similar to Inception, surprisingly. The film is very much focused on the mechanics of the Dunkirk operation and mostly uses the human actors to progress said mechanics. We don't really catch much of a glimpse of the opposing army in this film; just like Tenet, the antagonist is time itself (abstractly, not literally). Just as the limited window of time challenges Dunkirk's protagonists, Nolan is always challenged with ""getting the job done"" within the confines of the medium of film.

So to find thematic significance in Tenet, you have to look not at what the mechanics say about the human experience (Nolan just doesn't seem all that invested in that) but what the mechanics of the film say about the art of making a film.

So what does **Tenet** say about filmmaking?

In broadly abstract terms, the film is about progressing forward into an unknown future, or backwards into a known but possibly dangerous one. The idea of belief vs. knowledge comes up often, with the repeated mantra of ""ignorance is our ammunition"" and The Protagonist asking others what they *feel* when things are uncertain. The thematic conflict seems to be between knowing exactly how the mechanics of the universe work, or simply believing and feeling your way through it, and the film seems to side with the latter.

As Neil himself says, ""What's happened has happened... it's an expression of faith in the mechanics of the world."" This could just as easily be addressed to the audience, who want to pull apart the minute detail of how the film works. It's Nolan saying ""don't worry how the film works, just have faith that it does.""

**So Tenet could itself be a trap: A self-consciously complex puzzle of a film that argues thematically** ***against*** **being solved.**

Or maybe not, reading that back it sounds like I'm talking out of my arse.",im7etj

It kinda feels like a one-two punch of a bad choice getting doubled-down into a poor choice. These were good movies that could have been great if they received a second-opinion from a producer.
- “Quentin, were you planning on adding any more scenes with Sharon Tate?”

ggey5z3,"Coming fresh off my first viewing, and I'm sure I'll revisit it... some initial thoughts.

Definitely one of Nolan's most ""fun"" movies in that it throws you a lot of stuff to chew on. Of all his movies so far, this one seems the most brain-teaser to me. The problem is this movie wants to be a brain-teaser more than anything else.

Inception, which I think we can agree is the most similar to Tenet, gave the characters time to grow into real people. I *liked* Pattinson's and Washington's characters, but I feel like the only reason I liked them was because I liked the actors. All the emotional moments said ""okay, now feel this"" rather than guiding me towards that feeling naturally.

Tenet feels like a caricature of Nolan movies, exaggerating both the good and bad of his filmography. A nerve-splitting ticking bomb soundtrack that goes BRRR. An obsession for non-linear time. Blandly written characters. But above all, I think Tenet finally crosses the line where the complexity of the movie starts to encroach on the audience's ability to enjoy the movie, a line that movies like Interstellar, Memento, and Inception approaches but did not touch.

Adding on a quick thought, in the scene where the Protagonist unknowingly fights himself at Oslo, is the music in those scenes mirrored? The soundtrack sounds interesting, to say the least, and one of my first thoughts hearing it play out was ""this music was definitely designed to be played backwards"".",im7etj

g4erufq,"As a big Nolan fan, I liked this movie, but didn't love it. I hate to say it but some things were pretty predictable because he's done them before. At the same time, some things I usually enjoy from him I also totally loved here. 

It delivered on the conceptual part. It might even be Nolan's most fun film on a conceptual ""how does this work, how did that happen?"" level. Maybe a notch below Inception because I feel like there a couple of plot holes with the mechanics.

Even though it's pretty high-concept, I actually found it very easy to follow at a high-level. I knew that the guys they encounter at the vault must have been them as soon as we saw Pattinson's look of surprise, which is a bad thing for me. It was also pretty easy to guess that the woman would be the one she saw jumping off the boat as soon as you find out they're sending her back. But the details were really hard to follow to me. Did she know the painting was a fake? At what point did she know? What was the significance of the hole they were dropping the device in at the end? What exactly were the details of their two-team operation? All that stuff went over my head, which is partially what makes it fun. It has you trying to pay attention to everything the characters say.

In terms of emotional weight, it fell flat for me. Inception had me really caring for Cobb and his inability to let Mal go. Interstellar killed it with the scene where Matthew M watches the 20 years of footage his kids left him. But this had nothing like that for me. The ending shot of the boy and his mother was another predictable Nolanism, so it just fell flat. I guess that doesn't mean it's wrong, but idk, it could have been emotionally heavier?

The score, though not Zimmer, also felt very Nolan. His scores don't really do anything but add to what's on-screen in a redundant way. They don't tell you things you can't see, like what a character's thinking or feeling, or the hidden motivations of a bad guy, they just tell you when things are intense and that's about it.  Even though it sounded great, I was a bit disappointed that Ludwig didn't bring anything fresh from a ""function"" perspective. But, it did sound great.

And the set pieces and action were the best Nolanisms. That plane scene just had me laughing at how over-the-top it was, in a totally good way. The scene where they box in the truck was also fantastic. And the ending battle might be the most Michael Bay we've seen Nolan get, and it was pretty great. 

Overall I liked it, but didn't love it. I'm happy we got another Nolan film that is full of Nolanisms, but the next thing he makes I hope has almost none of them, because I think this is the last Nolanisms-packed Nolan movie I really need for quite a while.",im7etj
g4lx6ov,"So as with most (all?) Nolan movies, definitely worth seeing on the biggest screen (I saw it in real IMAX), outstanding visuals as usual.

From a technical standpoint, I feel like this was Nolan operating at his peak for sure. All the production elements were top-flight, and I really like that he (by default) had to mix it up in using a new editor and composer for this one. Even if it very much was a ""Christopher Nolan film"", those two being different did seem to give it a slightly different flare (or maybe it's just me).

Having said that...I think I can finally understand where the argument that he makes ""cold"" films come from. I haven't necessarily seen it in prior films of his, but this one I felt sort of detached while watching it? There are great performances here (even if it's a trope, I thought Branagh's villain was suitably despicable) from the main cast, compelling action (while confusing due to the nature of the film, I thought the actual setpieces were some of Nolan's best, with very clear editing versus the rapid cuts of films past), the story itself was interesting if seeming a little half-baked to me? I wanted to know more personally about how it all worked versus what almost felt like an, ""Don't worry about that, I'll explain later"" attitude at times from the film.

I think I definitely want to see this again to see if there's more clarity, I don't think it's quite as confusing as some reviews might have you believe but it does have some twistiness to it.",im7etj

g54ax83,"This movie was needlessly convoluted, and all in service of . . . what? It felt like Nolan used obfuscation to cover for a lack of substance. 

I've had issues with Nolan's expository dialogue before, he often has his characters explain what's happening on screen, while simultaneously showing us. But this film doesn't stop to let you catch a breath. Not only that, but everything is in service of what is ultimately a super simple spy movie plot. There was no emotional investment because the movie doesn't let us get to know anyone. Debicki's character was clearly intended as the emotional core, except Nolan just put her in a generic Damsel in Distress role. Making Sator an abusive husband is enough to make anyone wince, but even that felt like a cheat. Like he knew that her and everyone else was two dimensional at best so by making her the victim of something so objectively terrible we would be invested in the stakes. Ultimately I didn't care about anyone and failed to understand the significance of anything beyond ""the great future catastrophe."" 

I didn't have the same issues with dialogue in my theatre, and I honestly think that people will use the technical issues to give the film some credit. Because I can tell you, when you can hear what the characters are saying it's dumb and messy. You rarely know more than ""The Protagonist"" (come on with the name... That's like a 14 year old kid writing a story and marveling at how deep they are) which means you can never get ahead of the movie enough to enjoy what it's trying to do. Instead we just have to listen to him and other characters spout all this pseudointellectual BS. I found myself turning to my partner numerous times to ask ""why is this important?"" ""What's the significance of this?"" 

Even the action scenes fell flat because the true stakes were never explained. Just telling me whatever it is is ""worse than nuclear war,"" doesn't mean I'll engage with it when the film itself can't tell me who, what, or why anything is important beyond its service to this mysterious future event. What's worse is when tHe PrOtAgOnIsT asked questions or moments for revelations came, they'd go unanswered and just get lost in the shuffle. 

What's most frustrating is there are some cool concepts afoot here, and there's a good movie in there somewhere. But it badly needed a rewrite, it needed to flesh out it's concepts, it needed characters and stakes we could really care about, and it needed to use film language to let us get ahead of it instead of just leaving us to try to put the pieces together afterward.",im7etj
ge8lj2s,Nolan's best movies are like putting together a puzzle. This was more like untangling a piece a string. 5/10,im7etj
geoweux,"Just watched it , I understood the time travel concept  and I think it was a quite unique plot point. I think action sequences became too much complex to understand with people going reverse and forward in time. I also don't understand some of the character motivations e.g. motivation of the villain to destroy the world or the bond between kat and the protagonist felt so much forced.

Also how that bomb was given to Sator or how did future people communicated with  the past? 

Final thought : Going reverse and forward in time was cool as hell but the movie's plot was bland  and overused. 
It was more like a sloppy version of Mission Impossible / James Bond movie with some Nolan's Mindfuckery on top.

g3yqrky,"Compare the endings of Inception and Tenet, both of which are high-concept action movies.

Inception felt very fulfilling. There was also a perfect ambiguity in the mix with the totem. Cobb’s journey felt complete.

Tenet on the other hand just made me go ""Huh?"". I didn't even care for the characters at all and it felt like I was supposed to.

The ending kind of speaks for how well the movie navigated its foreign concept. Tenet spent most its time explaining and the emotion was lost.",im7etj
gh1v00c,"Just watched it. Thought it was really good, obviously some plot flaws, but I'm a sucker for a good character and Neil (Pattinson) was great. Usually I can spot the big reveal from a mile away and the early foreshadowing with the backpack was big of course, but it still takes a while to narrow down the possibilities, and once it's out in the open it really hits. I was legitimately left in awe by the arc he willingly signs up for. Saved the entire movie for me. The whole ""this is the end for me, but the beginning for you"" part almost choked me up lol",im7etj

g4um3vi,"It felt like Christopher Nolan at his Christopher Nolan-est. It'll more than satisfy his fanboys and also give his critics a ton of new fodder. 

**Pros:**

- Nolan continues to be the gold fucking standard of the in-cinema experience. The visuals alone are worth the price of admission; Perhaps the best and most innovative action sequences of his career. Also Ludwig Göransson's score is phenomenal. 

- The main cast all do a solid job. For most of this movie, the charisma and screen presence of the actors is only thing keeping you engaged through the super clunky dialogue and the intensely confusing plot (more on that later. and also earlier. and also simultaneously backwards and forwards and if you ask for any sort of clarity, the universe explodes). JDW gives a better James Bond performance than most of the actors that have played Bond and Branagh crushes it as the baddie.

- There were a lot of stand out scenes sort of like mini-movies within the insane main plot that were done really well. The opening at the opera house, the airport heist, and the car chase/interrogation scene all come to mind among others.

**Cons:**

- The plot. Jesus. Going into a Nolan movie you kind of expect to be digesting a lot and figuring things out on the fly, but this movie takes the cake. It genuinely felt like he was trying to confuse the audience as much as possible, like if you just overload their brains with enough surface level questions they'll have no time to think about the pseudo-science at its core. It was like the physics version of Jordan Belfort sweeping all the legalese under the rug in Wolf of Wall Street, except less self aware.

- Nolan's lack of ability to create characters with emotional depth is on full display. The sub-plot around the bond between the mother and son was by far the weakest point of the movie in my opinion and the emotional stakes it tries to create just seem laughably low. 

Overall, I'd definitely recommend seeing it in theaters. Above all else, it's a really fun movie and a textbook ""blockbuster"" that'll likely age well with repeated viewings. 7/10.",im7etj
gndcthc,This is the movie everyone thought Inception was when it first came out.,im7etj
gh8x5s8,"Just watched it. It was gorgeous, very well shot train wreck.  

  

Lots of things didn't make sense WITHIN the film's own logic. There's a bullet hole in a window when the bad guy is threatening to shoot the woman. Then he shoots her in the belly. He says he will shoot her again, but there's no second bullet hole in the window so you have physical evidence that it's an empty threat.  

  

It went from 60 to zero in no time. All of a sudden there's a long sequence on a yacht and they are going sailing? Wtf? Why are so many henchmen willing to go along with a plan to destroy the world? Why does the future want to destroy the past? They talk about the grandfather paradox, but its not really a paradox. If you kill your grandfather your father won't be born. And ""you"" won't be born.  

Sure you might be born to a different family in a different city/state/country but what makes you YOU is your past experience (ig who raised you/how you were raised/where you were raised). So it's not a paradox. Grandfather dead=you not being you aka you=dead.  

  

Pretty sure if you destroyed the past and made time flow all wonky the future wouldn't exist. And while the future might be ravaged by climate change seems real weird future people were like ""instead of sending help to the past lets just send them a time bomb""  

  

The red and blue teams looked like a freaking ARMY. and they were fighting NOTHING. Never saw one bad guy in the climax fight. Just people shooting at buildings. Same thing with the opera sequence there were moments where one guy was getting shot at, running over sleeping people and then all of a sudden he just pretended to be asleep?!?! And they didn't shoot him?!  

  

This movie was all over the map. It felt half thought out, where usually Nolan over thinks here it seemed like he said 'movie magic' when anyone pointed out loop holes. The moment Robert Pattison let the dude go in the freeport and advocated not shooting the other dude I knew it was our main characters from the future. Still have no idea how this hard boiled soldier/CIA killer all of a sudden cares about a lady and her kid. Just didn't strike me as believable in the least. It was very very beautifully shot and loved the score, but what an awful script. Sometimes Nolan comes up with an idea and then builds a script around it and it works (Idea guy can't make memories and the whole movie is backwards--> Memento) but this was an interesting idea but an awful awful plot.",im7etj
g3ya5a7,"Just got out of the movie. Pretty disappointed. There was some really cool cinematography and concepts, but the story/dialog was way to fast paced and really monotone. This caused the movie to be so confusing. All of the characters seemed way too confident and not emotional at all. Made me not really care for any of them. I also felt like the whole war scene at the end was pretty random and out of place. Felt like he is it wanted some war scene after directing Dunkirk. Overall pretty much okay.",im7etj
g3zt8va,"Tenet is Christopher Nolan at his best and worst simultaneously. Incredibly cool concept — localized time travel based on flipping an object’s entropy — combined with cinematic visuals like the hallway fight and building exploding make for an engaging, cerebral film, but when you can’t understand half the dialogue and the emotional core of the movie falls flat (“including my son...”), you’re left with a movie that feels like an imitation of Nolan’s other work. Tenet is closer to Wally Pfister’s Transcendence or The Adjustment Bureau than Inception, Interstellar or The Prestige.

There’s a good movie that could have been made out of this concept, but it is not Tenet. 

Few scattered thoughts:

- The Protagonist needs an actual name that the audience can latch on to. It’s hard to feel for a character when they are nameless. Every other character had a name.
- The soundtrack is amazing. Rainy Night in Tallin and Inversion are standouts. Top notch work by Ludwig Goransson.
- To complete the palindrome that this movie could have been, looping back to the opening opera scene would have been wonderful. Others have suggested that in this thread and I tend to agree. It would have made so much sense for the characters to deploy a time pincer movement across the entirety of the movie that reached back to the opera scene. Instead, we got nameless, faceless, unseen bad guys in a time war that we could have skipped.
- For being the Protagonist, the Protagonist does not appear to have a ton of agency as a character. Lots of things are done for him or by other characters around him, but I didn’t get the vibe that he was driving the story. Also, he jeopardizes the world multiple times to save a single woman who he barely knows, which does not seem to be characteristic of a CIA operative. It’s not uncommon for films but was a logical stretch, which took me out of the movie somewhat.
- The cast did a great job with the material. JDW and Pattinson in particular were standouts.
- I noticed a few too many editing mistakes that you normally won’t find in a Nolan movie. The lunch meeting between JDW and Debicki had a number of shots where JDW’s hands would move around from the prior shot. The same thing happened with the scene where JDW and Kapadja are walking, with her head moving from turned toward JDW to looking straight ahead several times depending on the shot. Whoever is in charge of continuity on set should have caught these issues or it could have been fixed in post, but that’s not what we got in the final product.
- Have we seen anything like Tenet before? Despite the flaws, Nolan delivers a compelling, cinematic experience. Crashing an actual plane into a building is right up there with the truck flip in The Dark Knight, and it is so nice to have a filmmaker who is provided the latitude and budget to do such incredible practical stunts on screen. Nolan and McQuarrie/Cruise elevate cinema with their practical stunts.",im7etj

g41kurh,"Seen it twice now and while I have a lot of big issues with it especially after the red/blue room onwards, the one 10/10 is the score. Ludwig knocked it out of the damn park and I can’t wait to see what he does next.",im7etj
g42fya1,"Not sure if I missed something? But the silver pill Sator was gonna take to kill himself, was that not the same dud pill that the Protagonist took at the start of the film? So he wouldn't of actually committed suicide either?",im7etj
g42os5s,"I don't think The Protagonist was meant to have romantic affection for Kat. I think it was more about his guilt in making her involved, and wanting to ensure she didn't pay for it. Neil asks Protag early on if he'd take a woman (or child) hostage, and Protag essentially did by getting her involved, and wanted to do right because of it.",im7etj
g4604r3,"I just finished it for the second time with closed captioning, my first time was in IMAX with no subtitles. It's insane how much more sense the movie makes when you can actually understand the dialogue. I thought about some weird plotholes on my second go around but as a whole I appreciate it much more and finally I understand the desert battle (I think?)",im7etj
g468ljd,"Overall, I liked this movie. It was fun, the concepts were cool, and when everything started coming together in the end it was really exciting. The action scenes were clever and well shot, and I especially loved seeing earlier scenes from the point of view of inverted characters.

But goddamn, Nolan, I think I have hearing loss now, this movie was SO loud. And many have said it but quite a bit of the dialogue was incomprehensible. This movie, despite being 2 and a half hours long, skips quite a bit of information between scenes. There's too much fast traveling and too little explanation of why the characters are where they or what they're doing. And the dialogue I could hear was pretty cringeworthy.

What this movie lacks, completely, is any soul at all. This is a thing Nolan has struggled with before, but it's never been this bad. Inception has Cobb's struggle with his dead wife, and while it's not particularly groundbreaking it adds SOMETHING to his character. Interstellar has all the hackneyed dialogue about love but Cooper's struggle to make it back to Murph is engaging at the very least. The protagonist of this movie (who wasn't even named to my knowledge) has absolutely nothing going for him emotionally. None of the characters do, really. Nolan's other movies at least tried to have some emotional pull. Tenet was entirely cool concepts and scenes with literally no reason as to why we should care. Washington and Pattinson are charming enough that they made it work, but they're just vehicles for ""time go backward"". As such it feels like there are no stakes. Sure the world gets wiped out if they lose but none of these characters make it feel particularly personal.

It also bothers me that the movie doesn't even show us who the characters are fighting in the final scene. They could have been shooting at nothing and I wouldn't have noticed. Sure, they're Kenneth Branagh's bad guys, but they were barely on screen. It was weird to have the big final showdown be against an enemy that was almost never seen.

This movie was like a 6 or 7 out of 10 for me. It mostly looked pretty and was very entertaining throughout, but it just doesn't feel as memorable as Nolan's previous movies because there's no emotion anywhere in the plot.",im7etj

g5ngm4l,"Was pretty nolan-y in all the best and worst ways. It looked great, the action sequences were great, music was great, pacing was pretty good, and Branagh played a great villain. But on the other hand the writing was pretty clunky, characters were pretty 1d, and it felt like at times the plot just served to set up cool action sequences. Never felt like there was much at stake either emotionally or just in general. Like they tell you about the end of the world and also why this guy wants to end it, but then they try to make you care about a child who you doesn't really get any screen time.

The plutonium heist sequence was pretty sick, the shot of the building blowing up in forward and reverse time was cool as fuck.

The protagonist and Ives getting dragged out of the explosion while Sator was getting dragged through the water was a neat juxtaposition.

I had a hard time following what was happening and why at times, but I was never sure if it was because I am dumb or because I missed important bits of dialogue.

Overall I thought it felt a lot like a Bond film with time travel elements. Maybe like Quantum of Solace mixed with Looper. Actually it had a lot of similarities to Looper. They even had similar ""don't think too hard about how the time travel stuff works"" lines.

I'd give it a solid 7/10. Side note is I went to a midday showing and had the entire theatre to myself and it was great.",im7etj

Like, did they say the final battle (and Kat jumping out of the boat) took place a few weeks before the main part of the movie? Then that means the protagonists and the entire army inverted themselves and just waited doing nothing for the same few weeks doing nothing? And speaking of the army, feels like I missed something and they just entered the plot for the finale out of nowhere. But they must be the Tenet organization from the future?  
Did Neil (implied by the backpack) spend a lot of time inverted doing nothing to reach the opera house offscreen after the ending?  
  
Feels like I'm missing an entire prologue (sequel?) movie on what this movie looks like from the far future's perspective and how they react to the events.  
  
That final battle was incomprehensible for my brain. The mission briefing made no sense and I wasn't sure what the goal was besides securing the macguffin of the movie. I even missed who they were fighting, just Sator's private army guarding the Algorithm? ~~I thought the movie only showed the protagonist's side too much and not enough of the enemy, such that it felt like they were just blasting buildings without really fighting anything.~~ (edit: I now could see the enemies after a rewatch)  
Were there 4 teams fighting there? Good side and bad side, and each having normal and inverted?  
What was the significance of shooting a rocket at an inverse collapsing building?  
Can't wrap my head around how the inverted team already fought the battle the red team is simultaneously just about to fight.  
  
Before discussing the final battle in the inverted boat, that pole outside the window was very distracting. Why was that moving back and forth in time anyway?  
  
What threw me off a lot is that everyone seems to find this laws of physics breaking mechanic very normal, even Kat. And then an entire army worth of people using time for war. Literally everyone is just finding the plot of the movie very easy except me.  
And they also just use the inverting machine without explaining much about it as well, like it's nothing unusual.  
  
That reversed conversation in the middle of the movie was really cool, want to read a transcript of that part later to follow both people's thoughts more clearly.  
And right after that, I thought the entire second half of the movie would be inverted, all the way back to the opera house. The plot wasn't quite that, but that's fine.  
  
What did they say happens if you enter the inverting machine without seeing yourself on the other side?",im7etj
g8ta869,"Stray observations:
•Niel is agent who saves the Protagonist in the opening scene.
•In the future humanity will develop the algorithm but pancreatic cancer remains presumably incurable.
•Why is the holiday in Vietnam Sator’s final day of happiness? Maybe because from that point forward Kat believes he is cheating on her. And wouldn’t shooting him create a pradox? 
•How could Niel (inverted) take a bullet meant for the protagonist? How could he have foreseen that fight?
•Someone pointed out rota’s square/puzzle. Perhaps that is the algorithm.
•Niel’s final goodbye happens moments before the cage fight.
•After watching this movie I am 100% sure Pattinson will be the best batman.",im7etj

gfzj9ml,"“Don’t try to understand it. Feel it.” Was this directed at the audience? With Inception and Interstellar and others, I didn’t have to watch it multiple times to understand what was happening on the screen, and I wasn’t constantly looking at my watch to figure out how much was left in the film. Multiple viewings on others made me catch some small things I previously missed, but at no point was I completely confused and as to what was going on while watching it or absolutely apathetic as to the fate of the characters. Maybe it was the lack of dialogue, the seemingly bizarre jump from action scene to action scene and character to character with little time for transition or building, or just the fact that the cast wasn’t as strong as in some previous films. Visually this is expectedly fantastic, but the character development and emotional backstory that usually makes me feel invested in how the story is going to play out just didn’t match the epic nature of this or Nolan’s better films. Maybe I’m just a shell of my pre-2020 self, but I honestly felt nothing for any of these characters while watching this. For me that was a bit of a let down.",im7etj
g4yoype,"Yeah I don't know how I feel about it... Nolan's other movies are pretty psuedo-intellectual with all the exposition and crazy complexities, but they give you time to digest it, and for the most part they make sense. This movie just spews exposition at the viewer with zero time to digest what it means before moving onto the next fifty concepts. I'm going to sound edgy for suggesting it, but it feels like a /r/iamverysmart movie incarnate. 

The third act scene felt so forced and rushed I had zero understanding of why or how 100+ people are all of a sudden aware of inversion and now fighting an evil army of henchmen. Like who or what heads the entire operation? At the end I feel like they allude to the Protagonist as the leader from the future, but what the... it's still so convoluted.

This entire movie is a metaphor for Nolan being so far up his own arse that he has come out the other side inverted. 

I just didn't care about anything. None of the stakes felt high enough. None of the characters felt worth empathizing with. 

Everything was verbal exposition. 

It honestly felt like an over elaborate student project that was confusing for the sake of it. 

It pisses me off even more that Nolan was trying to get people to go to the cinema during a global pandemic to see this garbage can of a movie.

Has Nolan's trademark dogshit audio editing (Seriously, Dunkirk's oscar for editing is likely the least deserving oscar ever awarded). Had cool scenes but instead of substance it attempted to confuse you into thinking it was smart. The film was expositioning literally the entire movie, and still failed at it judging by the majority of people still being confused. I saw it with my mother and neither of us realyl understood what happened and we were both paying full attention. Why did JDW simp for this girl so hard, to the point where he RISKED THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD to save her? Who was the nuclear scientist? Why was the entire WW3 aspect completely dropped in favor of a interpersonal drama between some woman and some crazy person who wants the world to blow up? I felt like if i had to explain this film beat by beat to someone they would attempt to covertly knock me out with a dart to bring me to a mental hospital. This film is just barely hanging on by a thread, and its hard to beleive Nolan has been conceivnig this film for almost a decade.

g49r8hl,"I'm not great at following quick moving plots so this movie had me lost from pretty early on. Between the scenes being so short with no real transitions and the dialogue being hard to understand I almost walked out of the theater.  I stopped caring about the characters because half the time I didn't really catch why they were doing anything and the whole plot with the drawing seemed to have no real importance to the overall plot at all and it took up what felt like half the movie.

This whole movie felt like it was trying to be a montage. There was overpowering music the entire time (really good soundtrack though) and lots of scenes with one sentence of dialogue that felt like it was made just for the trailer. Characters only had dialogue that was important to the story, like the line ""if i cant have you no one can"" which was super cheesy and felt out of place. Also the main character sucks. He is cocky for no reason. He's basically just floating through the story and other people are moving the plot forward (with the exception of the inverted car chase.) 

Neil's character was awesome and I really wish the story was about him plus Robert Pattinson did an excellent job. The concept is amazing too. Reversing somethings entropy is such a cool concept for time travel that I want way more of (aka Neil's story) The fight scenes were amazing and probably my favorite part and the opening scene was maybe my favorite scene.

g49wjsk,"Although I didn't fully comprehend the entire intricacies of the plot on first watch, I admire Nolan's boldness in making action movies around unique and complicated themes. This has sort of become his niche and it's showcased as both a good and bad thing in Tenet. IMO what this film lacked were the basic fundamentals such as better dialogue, less exposition, a tighter script and a sort of ""fun factor"". Despite its shortcomings I still couldn't help but be impressed with what I was watching on screen (saw it in IMAX) from a technical and visual perspective. The images and sounds of this film have stuck to my mind days after viewing. Although this film is one of Nolan's weaker entries (and I completely understand if general audiences downright dislike this movie) I couldn't help but enjoy it for what it was.

The 3rd act (Nolan's specialty) drew me back in thankfully and everything slowly fell into place. I wanted to understand everything that was happening but there was just no way. No character development, no connection to anyone, just scene after scene something new was happening with a new character. 

Dialogue was crazy hard to understand and make out, especially on the wind sailing boats. I feel like I just nodded in agreement with what they were saying and not actually getting anything.

however, much like Inception I’m sure this movie will benefit from having seen it multiple times when you can see all of the gears start turning as it happens. hated Inception the first time I saw it, then after trying it again, I fell in love with it and it’s one of my favorite movies. 

did rather enjoy what I saw otherwise though. the set pieces were great, John David Washington’s one liners were funny, Robert Pattinson was nice, action was top notch, Ludwig killed the score, just the plot was hard to follow.

g8o44ni,"Just saw it in IMAX, what a movie from Nolan! I feel like he raises the bar with every movie. Yes it was a bit confusing at first but after reading an explanation of it online I have a thorough understanding of the concept. Inception, Interstellar, Tenet, love these scifi movies!

Also after seeing Patterson in this movie, I have become more confident that he should do well as Batman. Prior to that the only movie I've seen him in was Twilight and well yeah we'll just keep it at that. Seeing him in Tenet I feel like his acting has improved in his ability to play a more indepth character. Any doubts I had about him are gone and I very much look forward to the new Batman..

Third.. When Neil said ""we need fast cars"" was anyone else hoping Dominic Torreto would appear on screen?? Haha",im7etj

gd6ctch,"Honestly, this is the most shallow Nolan movie to date. The movie isn't even complex; it's \[overly\]-complicated and as a result, suffers from a clear lack of character and story depth. There's a difference. Not to take away from the enjoyment, but this movie is ironically just a cliched save the world type with extra steps.

Also, Nolan stans who respond to critics as being too dumb to understand his movies are clearly pseudo intellects who don't understand that we either do and still think it's dumb, or that we're not going to movies to solve a freaking brainteaser with very little emotional payoff. There's a time and place for everything.",im7etj

IF YOU WATCH MOVIES WITH SUBTITLES AT HOME, GET THE CLOSED CAPTION DEVICE FOR THE THEATRE. 
 
Really though. A lot of people don't even know this is an option. I saw Tenet a few weeks ago and liked it, but missed so much of the dialogue due to mostly not understanding certain accents. Saw it again tonight with a closed caption device and followed the movie so much fucking better. 
 
After seeing the movie a second time, I'd give it a 9/10. The acting, music, and script are all phenomenal. There's two or three lines of dialogue that belong in a trash can. JDW and Robert Pattinson are both really good, and Pattinson's charisma in particular just melts off the screen.",im7etj

g47q83o,"Personally really liked the movie and plan to watch it over again someday with subtitles. concept and music/soundFX and all (I agree with the undesirable mixing with dialogue) and some scenes gave me some “cool exciting” vibes.

But the one thing left me wondering from my earlier preconceptions of the film. With the whole lab scene when the Protagonist is with the Tenet scientist she explains the inverted objects and hows these objects (found floating around I guess) operate by reversing entropy. 

At first I thought how normal time flow people using inverted object weapons would have a neat role run fighting bits like (firing and catching a bullet infinite, or gun is knocked from hand and caught again) stuff like that. After watching I see doesn’t fit the built physics but I wonder why how that was put into the lab scene in that way. Did I miss something?",im7etj

Overall, I really enjoyed the movie.  There were elements that I was able to figure out pretty early on, but there were also moments that caught me by surprise.  I thought the movie was well-cast, with everybody bringing something to the table.  Washington's character was radiated this intensity, to the point where even when he was cool and somewhat relaxed, there was still this underlying intensity.  It's like how Denzel is always cool to some degree, and John is always intense.  I've seen people busting on Brannagh's accent, but I really didn't have a problem with it, and he did well.  Pattinson was a good guide, and perhaps the best 'cool' character in the film.  I've really reevaluated what I thought of him, and I feel like I'm watching his career go on a Brad Pitt-like trajectory from pretty boy to being recognized for his legitimate gifts.  Debicki just seems so helpless, not really in a damsel-in-distress sort of way, but more like a real person crushed by circumstance.  I really felt her catharsis.  Johnson was fine, but I felt like Nolan had written that role for his frequent collaborator Tom Hardy?",im7etj

I actually didn't have a problem deciphering the words and phrases being said, but I could not for the life of me understand the meaning behind 90-95% of the dialogue. If someone turned to me after every scene and asked ""what was that conversation about?"" I would tell them I had no clue. I think I understood the major plot points for most of the film, but by the time the final battle scene unfolded, I was completely lost.

g530qwa,"I just saw the movie yesterday and while I appreciated its originality, as a complete package it was ultimately a bit of a disappointment (and I love Nolan's work btw). I agree with most of the criticisms - the writing, the sound, the editing etc.


Just one thing I wanted to add was that I couldn't help comparing Tenet to Inception, and one of the reasons I think the latter is a much superior movie is the main character. The Protagonist was such a hollow and unrelatable character; just an agent completing a mission. Compare that to Cobb and all that we learned about him throughout the movie. All Cobb wanted was to be able to go home and see his kids again. There was no world war, no crisis on global scale, no threat to humanity, yet by the ending I cheered. Sorry but no cheers for The Protagonist.",im7etj
g6ifzu2,"As you might expect in a time travel movie there are a lot of twists. Some are predictable and some are not, which is fine. But the biggest ones at the end being the most predictable was disappointing simply because it was treated with a buildup that wasn’t warranted. When Neil pulls the runner’s mask off and we don’t see who it was, basic movie structure made it obvious. So too did “I’ll tell you later who hired me.” And again that’s fine, but when those later got a prominent reveal it felt like much ado about nothing. By contrast, Kat having seen herself dive off the boat was something I didn’t see coming and the subtlety with which it was treated made the realization much more enjoyable.

Speaking of which, a twist I thought I saw coming turned out not to be. Which I at first thought was a weird thing to imply for no payoff, but later wondered if Nolan wasn’t pulling a reverse fakeout. Specifically, Sator has a suicide pill he says he got from the CIA. But we learned in the beginning about fake suicide pills for testing loyalty. It seemed they were setting him up to fail the attempt. But then the pill was irrelevant. Seems an odd inclusion for a section of the movie that already had enough elements.

Also, having an end-of-the-world event that you have to go back in time to reach really undermines the drama.  I know, they handwaved the Grandfather Paradox enough times. But that itself proves that either A) they were predestined to succeed and were just going through the motions (it’s in the past, as Neil would say), or B) the algorithm doesn’t do what they thought it would. In fact if the future people were correct that it doesn’t affect them, then by iteration it doesn’t affect anyone. Instead of asking us not to care about that it could have been avoided by a few tweaks.

Finally I found that big portions felt more like “because movie” than strictly for plot. The giant battle at the end looked awesome but that chaos wasn’t necessary. It covered for Neil changing plans but that could have happened with a lot fewer people shooting. And at the other end the “reverse chaos bullet” isn’t really what the plot is about. People were inversing themselves and manufacturing items that do it on their own played no part in this. But it worked to slowly introduce the audience to the time travel idea while slow-rolling the inversion machines for later on.

I don’t want to be too negative though. I liked Tenet and will watch again. I just think it could have set the bar a little higher.",im7etj

galxllr,"I thought the movie was severely miscast which was the biggest problem. John David Washington just didn't work at all. When you have a high concept exposition-heavy script you need an actor to be able to sell you the emotions you're meant to be feeling but don't quite understand yet. An actor like Tom Hardy or Ryan Gosling would have killed this role and brought a lot more emotion regardless of your grasp of the plot. John David is not bad, but not good either, just okay, I found him to be flat for most of it and lacked any real weight or gravitas in his performance, he really lacks the experience needed for this role. I really don't see much range in him from Ballers to Blackkklansmen to this he's competent but not leading man yet. 
Kenneth Branagh also served an okay performance. I usually can't fault him but in this, he wasn't menacing or villainous as he could've been. Would have liked to see him turn up the intensity here, I mean he decided he wants to end the world but he's also chilling on a yacht in shorts and sandals like his on vacation- those still moments are ripe for him to play around in but he doesn't.
Audio issues aside- the right casting, or in this case the right acting could've made up for a lot. I wonder if Pattinson would be a better lead as his got the requisite experience and range a Nolan film requires.",im7etj

Seriously, while we're here can someone explain how inversion works, especially with regard to free will?

Last death didn't land for me, the movie didn't convince me that's how it has to be.

g3yhd72,"I really enjoyed it. It's not Nolan's best movie by any means as far as the intricacy of the story goes. I think he made the very conscious decision to not give The Protagonist any background or anything for the audience to latch onto and I think that really hurt the film.

That being said I still enjoyed the hell out of it overall. All of the set pieces (except for the final big set piece, which was cool looking, but kinda just visual noise) were all fantastic. My highlights being the opening scene at the Opera (Fuck me, Chris Nolan knows how to open a movie), the scene where JDW fights the Inverted ""SWAT guy"" and then the 2nd time we experience that, and also the car chase sequence. I also believe there is just so much to chew on after leaving the movie. Some may say that this is bad filmmaking, but I disagree. I think it tied enough threads into a nice bow, while also leaving some threads untied that keep you thinking.

One for example, is Neil being Kat's son. Originally, I thought the idea was preposterous. But I'm starting to think it may be the case. Apparently the coin that is attached to his red string on his backpack is a Vietnamese coin....

g42poz8,"If they were to invert and invert again, it seems like there would be an infinite number of themselves at the same time. With just 1 inversion, it makes sense there would be two instances of someone existing at the same time, one moving forward and one backward. But in the case of a second inversion, it almost seems like for every discrete instance of time that exists between the first and second inversion (infinite, continuous) there would be a subsequent instance of them catching up with the others.

I understand the way the film presents it, 1 instance for each inversion at a specific time throughout the timeline, but it just seems like the infinite way would work too. If not, it also seems like someone could just go back and forth a bunch of times essentially making an army of clones led by the future most version. Or at least as much mass that can be created (?) from the finite amount of energy powering the machines.

After the first inversion, I felt like there was another Neil out there the entire time. As if the Neil we were introduced had already been through the timeline once, inverted, and inverted again prior to the start of the movie.

g5gi9fd,"This movie broke me. I don't know if it has to do with old age or just how convoluted Nolan's movies have become. Maybe it's because it's the first movie I've seen in a theater in over 6 months and I was feeling on edge with paranoia the entire time. Especially because the person sitting two seats to my left kept fucking coughing without a mask. It was hard for me to stay focused and become invested in the story and characters. I mostly took it all at face value and decided to do the ""work"" after the movie was over.

So, about 4 hours later, I'm still trying to piece together the strands of entropy, time inversion and temporal paradoxes. I've watched about a dozen ""Tenet explained"" videos on YouTube far exceeding the film's runtime. I think I'm finally starting to understand the broad strokes of the plot, but I keep getting tripped up on all the details. Such as the things we don't see: the far future and far past. When was Tenet created by the Protagonist? I assumed that he inverted all the way to the past and eventually recruited himself (and Neil). But in some theories, they suggest that he created it sometime in the distant future, which means he then had to invert to years before in order to reach the events of the film. Especially if you consider the MaximilieN/Neil theory, which would mean the Protagonist trains him far into the future. I just don't understand how this time inversion stuff works or how things (such as the pieces of the Algorithm) get sent back into the past. I understand the concept of the ""turnstiles,"" but that seems to indicate you have to keep moving in one direction in real time in order to reach your destination. Unless there's something else I'm missing entirely.

Anyway, I liked the scope of the film, and Nolan's ideas always makes you think. I didn't like it as much as Memento, Inception or Interstellar, but it's definitely among the best I've seen this year. I definitely need to watch it again sometime, preferably with subtitles, since a lot of the dialogue seemed muffled to me. (Again, I don't know if this has to do with old age or the fact that I haven't seen movies in a theater in so long. Or perhaps Nolan is just pulling another ""Bane"" on us.)",im7etj

g6gbhoc,"I honestly don't even know how to begin writing or even speaking about this movie. Christopher Nolan is my favorite director in Hollywood because he takes risks and brings in fresh ideas that you just don't get from many people nowadays. Even if his movies aren't always the best, you can appreciate him for the effort. That being said, my wife asked me when I got home last night, 'How was the movie!? What was it about?!' and I didn't even know what to say.

First of all, this was my first movie in theaters since March, which is insane. Throughout much of the movie, my thought process was, 'What did I do to my hearing between March and now that has rendered me completely unable to understand a single word that they are saying?' I was actually worried there was something wrong with me because I couldn't hear any dialogue for large parts of the movie, so I'm very relived everyone else experienced that too.

Due to that, the movie has this 'don't think, feel' aura to it that they actually bring up when discussing the inversion process at the beginning of the movie. I found myself having absolutely no idea what was happening for the first hour/hour and a half, but I also felt like that was completely how Nolan designed it. He wants chaos in his audience, and this movie brought it. With the incredible score behind this film, I decided at one point to just sit back in my seat and sort of let the movie wash over me. It succeeded. 

Toward the end of the movie you start feeling a bit more sane and those thoughts of 'what is wrong with my brain' start to recede a bit, but it's still hard to follow. Overall, the spectacle, the score, some of the amazing fight scenes that kept your head scratching, the amazing inversion scenes (especially the cars moving backwards) were fantastic. I'm such a sucker for intense, awesome music being the driving force behind action sequences, and man this delivers. The concepts brought up in this movie were extremely cool, and I admire the filmmaking process even though I truly don't understand it.

My complaints are with the sound (this to me brought me WAY further out of the experience than I wanted), and some of the storytelling. I understand wanting to add some confusion into the mix, but the confusion was brought to a level that made me literally feel like there was something wrong with me because I couldn't understand large portions of the movie. With that same storytelling, they also don't dive deep enough into the characters and their motivations. I'd give it a B+, as it was incredibly entertaining and a huge movie spectacle, but it will require another viewing, or three.",im7etj
g7b0p48,"Dialogue was very “I’m explaining this” “yes, now explain this” “I will explain that now” which I don’t like. Sounded like Nolan listened to a couple science podcasts and made them into a script. But since it’s an action movie, dialogue isn’t as important, and with such a complicated time altering plot it’s admittedly necessary to have that explanation for the audience to grasp what’s happening... But, of course, 70% of the dialogue is impossible to hear. So, on the off chance I get to actually understand the character, the words coming out of their mouths are so clunky and unnatural it’s just as annoying as not hearing them. So, in my opinion/experience, the dialogue and plot of the movie (two fairly important aspects to most movies) were simply not good.

And that leaves the action. Again, it’s an action movie, this is what we came for. Everything else can be excused for the fighting. And it was fine. I must’ve over hyped how interesting the inverse action was going to be, because it definitely wasn’t worth sitting through the movie. Of course the CGI and practical effects were good, but that’s not a selling point to me anymore. There’s an endless number of big expensive movies I’d rather be watching.

gg4e9k6,"Just finished watching Tenet. It was... okay. It feels like a movie that would be much more enjoyable the second time around. Nolan was clearly aiming to blow the audience's mind a few times in the latter half of the film, and I'll admit that he succeeds in doing so, but the big ""reveal"" moments are only satisfying because the first half is so confusing. The first hour or so is an absolute chore to get through, partially because the story is so convoluted, and partially because Nolan still doesn't know how to mix sound properly. There were so many points in this movie where characters were incredibly difficult to hear. I had no idea what the characters were doing half the time because I couldn't hear what was said in the previous scene. To make matters worse, Nolan decided that characters who are inverted should be wearing oxygen masks, which makes them almost completely unintelligible at times. You'd think he would have learned his lesson with Bane, but apparently he didn't.

You know the old idiom about the tail wagging the dog? Nolan let his time inversion trickery wag the story, and the movie suffered for it. The time-related ""gimmicks"" he's used in the past in Memento, Inception, and Dunkirk always felt like components that were necessary to tell their respective stories and never stood in the way of the films as a whole. With Tenet, the story really plays second fiddle to the gimmick.",im7etj

It was like watching a parody of Nolan movies. It was so convoluted that it felt like they were just making up the plot while filming. Do they hire sound engineers or were they hoping you wouldn't hear the audio so you wouldn't be able to realize just how poorly put together the plot is?

There's a lot of fun stuff in this movie, but it is far overshadowed by the many flaws.",im7etj

Like Neil and the Protagonists' 'first' meeting, the car chase, the building, the first fight at the airport etc. And also the backpack with the red thread coming up in the opera, which I apparently missed the first time around. 

That is not to say that I fully understood the whole plot or that there weren't any plot holes (boats and cars going backwards is something people'd notice right? edit: honestly after the clarification I still hardly get it), but it kept me on the edge the whole time and the third act blew my mind. I also liked the chemistry between Neil and the Protagonist, I think Robert Pattinson and John David Washington did a great job. Part of that is probably also because Pattinson in those suits and fighting attire made me feel tingly in all the right places.

I did think Elizabeth Debickis' character was... a bit flat. I didn't quite understand why the Protagonist suddenly became so invested in the safety of her and her son. I get why he needed her to meet her husband, but he almost immediately went above and beyond for her which I didn't feel was warranted.

Jokes aside, it was great. I appreciate how they slowly increase the complexity of the action until you can reach a scene with as many moving parts as the final action sequence and have it make complete sense. The vocal mixing wasn't great, but that's not exactly a hot-off-the-presses take, and I think the impacts sounded appropriately weighty in an IMAX theater. John David Washington killed it with the perfect mix of confidence and confusion, and I appreciate how we finally got a mainstream time travel movie with pretty bulletproof continuity. My only real problem with the movie is how little downtime there was - we didn't get much time to know these characters as actual people and every time they made a joke it felt off-key.",im7etj

gg5289h,"I watched it last night and I feel like it's probably one of the worst, if not the worst, of Nolan's movies. I was only invested in it to see how the time inversion stuff played out, not because I cared about the protagonist. Really, the only person I cared much for in the movie was Neil, he seemed like a cool character with personality and very set goals and morals/ethics (which you don't really know the full scope of until the end). Compared to Protagonist, who seemed super stiff, devoid of real personality, and kind of doing whatever he wanted to without a specific compass guiding him besides ""save woman I just met and her son"" imo. I know that his goals expand as he learns more, but without any real emotional beats playing out, I just didn't care by that point.

Action scenes were very cool, but seemed derivative of his other films, just with a different glossy gimmick. He's done the wonky close combat fight better (Inception) and the crazy care chase with big vehicles better (DKR) and the tech that appears to be magic better (Prestige) and different story timelines converging better (Dunkirk). I could go on. So while it was cool to look at, I felt like I was kind of seeing beats that I have seen before just slightly remixed.

Add to that that I loooooove time travel/manipulation movies, seen a ton of them and this one is not even the best of that genre. When they were dropping time travel theories into the conversations and explaining them I was more amused then astounded. I can't believe there are people who haven't heard of the ""grandfather paradox"" in a world where Back to the Future exists, but maybe I am giving fellow moviegoers too much credit. Either way, it feels like it's simultaneously overexplaining stuff (like the grandfather paradox etc) and also underexplaining stuff (more in universe ideas, where do they get all the inverted air they need to use for week+ on end, etc). It's silly but I wanted to know more about how the movie world works, and needed less of the basic physics/theory stuff explained.

I acknowledge that if I watch it again, I may pick up other things and even like it more, but it was such an initial slog (especially the first half) that I don't feel like going back to it any time soon. So while there were good things in the movie, I don't think it came together completely. I also don't like that there wasn't a real strong emotional connection/relationship to ground me in the science fiction ideas, where in other Nolan films, he has managed to do that. What is the point of cool sci fi spectacle if I don't care about the main character or the fate of their universe? The end should have hit hard, I know it was trying to, but it just didn't and that is disappointing.

And if anyone wants to know, my favorite Nolan film is probably The Prestige followed by Inception. And for time travel/manipulation films, I enjoyed Timecrimes, Predestination, Coherence, Synchronicity and The Girl Who Leapt Through Time.",im7etj

g463277,"I saw ""Tenet"" last night and here are my thoughts:

Pros:

The performances, cinematography, practical special effects, and action sequences were fantastic. It was great to finally see a movie in the theater again, and ""Tenet"" is a visually absorbing thrill ride that will keep you entertained from beginning to end.

Cons:

The script has many great concepts, but the execution is sub-par as few of Nolan's ideas mesh together well and neither does the film's plot make much sense. Tenet's main problem was that characters, settings, MacGuffins, and plot threads were simply not established well and as a result the movie has difficulty flowing from scene to scene. It often isn't clear who a character is, what their motivation is, what their relationship is to someone else, why a person is at a certain location, what a given object signifies, etc. By the end of the film you're able to make sense of these things, but for most of the 2.5 hour movie you struggle to understand it on a basic level. Almost all of the dialogue was exposition, leaving little room for character development or humor except for a handful of scenes.

Additionally, I have mixed feelings about the musical score. For the most part, I think that the soundtrack has a hard-driving energy that helps with the film's pacing. But there were times where it felt like sirens or alarms had been incorporated into the score, causing me to cringe during one action sequence. And as many others have complained, the sound mixing was bad: music and sound effects played over dialogue or lasted for too long in many scenes and this made the plot even more difficult to follow.

Overall:

This is probably my least favorite Nolan movie. Not bad, but it's probably the only one of his films I didn't really enjoy. I definitely recommend seeing it for the action sequences and performances (especially since this is really the first new release available in theaters since March), and I would like to see it again. But I would like to see Nolan make something a bit more...straightforward with his next film.",im7etj

As Sator says to JDW, the future wants to destroy the past because the actions of individuals in the past causes climate change. The idea of our descendants wanting to destroy us is fascinating and, although lacking in nuance, the commentary on climate change is thought provoking. In the end, JDW (Protagonist) affirms that this generation takes care of itself. I find the ending of the film to be ambiguous: perhaps Sator is right. To destroy all of existence, quickly and painlessly, might free the future from the sins of the past (as long as the grandfather paradox doesn't apply). However, the film's ultimate position, IMO, is that we must continue to struggle, to learn and grow, and face our problems together. Will future generations loathe and pity our ignorance? Certainly. BUT as we are reminded, we must do the best we can - like care for our children, like Kat, and appreciate friendship, as Neil and JDW do.",im7etj
g44q75t,"I definitely enjoyed it, but as the film finished, my enjoyment gave way to the realisation that we're now going to have to endure years of people on the internet pedantically picking over the very minute details of how time mechanic works, complaining about ""plot holes"".

It's borderline impossible to write an entirely consistent, logically-robust film that involves bootstrap paradoxes, time manipulation etc. because these are things that don't actually happen in the real world.

So when I saw someone complaining because "">!the glass in the Oslo freeport turnstile room would have had to have been installed with the bulletholes already in it!<"", that might be correct (or might not be) but I'd encourage people to worry less about the minutiae and enjoy the experience as a whole, because it is a really great experience. There's stuff in this film I've honestly never seen before, wild crazy visual ideas that just blew my mind.

g47u8pd,"I have to give credit to Nolan for this ambitious plot. I admit I have not seen that many films in my life, but I have not seen anything like Tenet. This was refreshing in comparison to other blockbuster action films we've seen in the past few years.

With that said, the film doesn't do a good enough job explaining the plot, or I'm an idiot. About half-way through the film, I was slightly lost, and near the end of the film, where they did that ""temporal pincer operation"", I had no idea what I was watching anymore. After the movie ended, some other people have said the film was confusing, so I knew I wasn't the only one. This wasn't unexpected though, as most plots involving time travel can be difficult to understand. I might have to rewatch this film later in my home.

The film is still pretty entertaining, as do most Nolan blockbusters. The way John David Washington and Robert Pattinson fight against people moving in inverted time was fun and captivating, even though it can be disorienting. The film was clearly more plot-focused, so I didn't really care that the characters were kind of flat.

One major complaint was the sound. Some people have said that the dialogue was difficult to hear. For me, another issue was that it was such a loud film. Gun shots, car crashes, fist fights, everything is so jarringly loud. The last action movie I saw in theater was MI: Fallout, and that was nowhere as loud as this film.

3.5/5. Not bad, but could have done better.",im7etj

g4h2zly,"While the audio issues are bad, I didn't find them to be *that* bad. Maybe because I was expecting the dialogue to be low I tuned in more closely it? 

The movie wasn't too hard to follow. At first the mystery of what was going on and who they were fighting at their airport got me. I was a little lost then, but I was fully enthralled. The fight choreography was amazing. Then once they introduced the inversion machine it clicked. I understood the movie and even said to myself ""he was fighting himself."" Sure enough, I was right. Once the Inversion was explained the movie became even better for me. 

My biggest gripe is how the trailers kinda ruined the time inversion elements. Had Nolan just kept that a secret, and maybe had the ""time travel"" line thrown in the trailer just to fuck with the audience. It probably would have made for a great reveal when watching the movie. 

Overall I really enjoyed this and can't wait to see it again. Watched this at a 10am showing with about 10 people in a 350ish seat IMAX theater.",im7etj

There is way to much plot for a movie with this concept, and not enough time is given to explain how things work (they cut away from explanations multiple times and there is even a line that says “just don’t think about it”). By comparison Inception is a pretty simple plot with a cool/ complicated concept, while Tenet by comparison has a complicated plot AND concept. There are specifics things that i have criticisms/questions about, but I don’t wanna huge wall of text.

The characters while not that depth full worked well and serviced the plot perfectly fine. Again to compare with Inception- nothing as complex as Cobb (if you wanna call him complex).

The actual filmmaking i thought was really good, the action scenes felt hard-hitting and the corridor scene was pretty sweet from a choreography point of view. From a visual standpoint there’s some really cool stuff in here, I just wish the plot made a little more sense.

After seeing this film three times (mostly to get clarification on events), and I don’t regret seeing three times. But this is defiantly a case of me enjoying film more then is actually is GOOD.

After reading all these relatable comments I feel much more at ease with this movie's failure to communicate than with my own failure to comprehend. Even the insanely cool scenes were useless and diminished to me because I didn't understand their significance, their cause and effect, or their impact. For example, the blue soldier being sucked into a wall that was being destroyed in reverse. How did the explosion not push him away? How did it suck him in and then seal the wall? How did that building (the distraction) blow up and repair itself simultaneously? How in the world is John David Washington catching things in the present that were somehow dropped in the future? Why is this concept introduced but hardly ever used after its introduction?

And how can this film be so polarizing to my own self. Forget the polarizing reviews -- I'm torn between my own opinion of the entire style and substance of Tenet. 

On one hand, Christopher Nolan makes verifiably *cool* films. They're just so slick man. His character and setting choices look like a 150 minute commercial made by Rolex, GQ, and some yacht manufacturer whose existence my financial worth has no right knowing. His protagonists are cool, their outfits are cool, the things they do and say are cool. I've seen well-tailored suits before but Nolan's protagonists are always doing it better. The clothes they wear are fashionable not for fashion's sake but because it looks good and fits well. The cars and boats and planes and motorcycles all seem to be realistic yet unattainable to 99.9% of the population. For example, that black yacht looked sleek and futuristic but not unrealistically so -- I imagine such a yacht actually exists to people with lifestyles I cannot comprehend in this lifetime. Nolan's locations are beautiful and intriguing and original -- he goes to real places I've never seen in countries that I have. I'm sick of Paris/London/New York City/San Francisco; this film and Nolan's others provide incredible new settings which actually deliver. Scenes like the reverse bungee jumping, the kitchen fight (cheese grater: nothing more to say), the fight at the time inverters in Oslo, the plane crash, the highway chase, final battle at the paintball course in the desert, all were mindblowing. Nobody else has action scenes this ambitious. But....

None of it mattered or made sense. I'd say roughly 37% of the dialogue was incomprehensible, whether due to bad sound or just plain bad writing. John David Washington jumped around to places and events like a gamer trying to do a speed run on whatever Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game is being made next. I have no idea why I walked away from Tenet with more of an impression of Kat on a yacht talking about her son than the urgency of saving the world from destruction. I literally don't know who the Priya character was, or why she went from being threatened at gunpoint by John David Washington in her fortress to strolling amicably with John David Washington and casually chatting about his protagonism. Tenet's script comes across like it was written by two psychology majors who are theorizing way too deeply about Inception in Starbucks and when they realize some cute gullible girls a table over are subtley listening to their conversation they raise their voices and start throwing around big words and ideas which barely have any significance. Good grief I don't even care anymore. I'm going to continue this sentence the same way Tenet did after the confusing climax at the Halo Forge map -- I'm going to suddenly",im7etj

I remember sitting through The Prestige, confused and not entirely knowing what was happening, but being able to guess and make theories as the movie was running only to have those dashed 5 minutes later when a new twist occurred and I had to rethink everything. All off this led to a satisfying conclusion that let me thinking well after the movie ended. It was incredibly engaging and an experience I’d love to have again in a theater. 


Then there’s Tenet. I was so lost and had nothing to grab on to. I was proud of myself when I finally figured out some piece of a concept or what was happening, but was then left thinking “ok well what do I do with this?” When it was revealed that protagonist (anybody catch his name...?) was really fighting himself at the art vault thing, I feel like I was supposed to be shocked but instead I was just more confused. Then again at the end when Pattinson was at the end and Protagonist was at the beginning, again, supposed to be a crazy twist but... What? And even at the end when Bad Guy was going to kill himself to kill reality, did anyone understand why that would kill reality...? (And her son...?) 


I hate to say it because I’m a big fan of Nolan’s work to date but.... I’ve gotta say I think he went to far this time. Or maybe not far enough? With Inception you can see how carefully every piece was considered and the presented. Every time I watch it I catch something new. It felt like Nolan took Charlie’s conspiracy wall and was able to repackage it to be understandable for the average audience. With this it feels like there was a concept so complicated and that wasn’t developed enough to make any sense.

This movie drops you right in the shit. No names, no employer, very little who and why and how. And there’s a point where the movie openly admits Nolan didn’t think this through.

I feel like this is one of those times where Nolan suggested to his wife “wouldn’t it be cool if...” then went overboard with his ambitions. Because for the first two acts, I was kinda lost.

Soundtrack was great.

Visuals were great.

Acting was great. (The three leads did really well)

Action was interesting.

Set pieces were interesting and well done.

The biggest let downs were the plot and the audio.

The plot was convoluted and the characters kept referring a plot device as different things, which made it complicated to understand what they meant. This was not at all helped by the audio.

This is Nolan's worst movie audio. You have these great actors and amazing score, but don't make the conflict so much! There is a scene in a crowded street where two characters are talking about an important character and the score is almost as loud, if not louder than their dialogue. So you have three conflicting audio noises. Dialogue, background extras, traffic and the score. So you're lucky to get 1/3 of the words they're saying. This wouldn't be so bad if it hadn't been the same in Nolan's last two movies, Dunkirk and Interstellar. In Dunkirk it was fine because it's war, you can't ask the battle to stop for you to have a conversation, but in Interstellar there was a scene of a character in bed talking to someone. There should be no reason for bad audio mixing there.  Same issue came back in Tenet and spoiled the experience for me.

Still rate the movie 8/10 and recommend it though.",im7etj
g49muo1,"I've seen the film twice now and i'm still not fully following the car chase scene. Where does the piece of the algorithm end up?

- Protagonist steals it from the convoy and does the (empty) orange box exchange over the car.

- Sator does the reverse interrogation scene and goes ""back"" to check the BMW glove box. 

- Now inverted protagonist drives the inverted silver car, tracks the orange box and gets his car into position for the handover in reverse.

- Inverted Sator sees that inverted protagonist is the one driving the silver car, we see the handover again and realise protagonist threw it to himself in the silver car. But this reveal is all happening in reverse- we see the algorithm ricochet around in the silver car, flies out of his window and back into the original car with Neil.

So that ""past"" version of the algorithm we see would continue backwards to before it was stolen from the truck...so where does the ""future"" version of it end up? If protagonist threw it into the silver car, it was in the car with inverted protagonist the whole time? When/where did Sator get hold of it, is it just done off-screen after he torches the car?",im7etj

Granted this is a universe saving mission, but how many years of his life did he throw away to do it?

Obviously there were a bunch of things that could've made it better like the pacing of the dialogue and letting the concept of the film breathe instead of shoving it in our face, but I couldn't help but smile at how awesome the movie was. 

I was just thinking of how amazing that a film with this type of premise is even made, like being able to come up with a movie like this is just insane to me. The characters were all pretty interesting even the main antagonist. It got a little confusing in the end, after Sator went through the turnstile I'm assuming he was going backwards in normal time. But then later on why are most of the characters going forwards in normal time?

Incredibly hard to follow at times and it wasn’t ALL on the sound mixing either. I like to think that I don’t need my hand held but some of the action sequences made it easy to lose track of who was moving forward and who was moving inverted.

Also, I guess Christopher Nolan was like “FINE guys I GET it I won’t use a dead wife for character development this time” but the swapsies to a domestically abused wife also for that purpose didn’t exactly sit right with me either? At the same time I think Elizabeth Debicki probably felt the closest to being something approximating a 3D person. So I’ll let that sit a little while longer.

This is perhaps the most “cold” I’ve ever seen Nolan. I know he’s not one to write heartwarming scenes but all of these characters have nothing to them. The acting is wooden, the editing is poor (it seems like Nolan wrote a mini series then cut all the things that make up a story and replaced it with exposition, actions scenes, exposition, action and so on). The sound mixing is terrible and is worse than any other film he’s directed (which is saying a lot). And the plot...

I mean, the lead character (“the protagonist”...seriously? Give me a break! Why should I invest 3 hours to a movie that can’t even give the lead a fucking name. This isn’t some clever move ala Fight Club, it’s just laziness) basically looks at the camera in the first 20 minutes and tells the audience to not try and understand the main concept of the movie!

And it seems like he’s become so hard headed since his film didn’t save cinema and was a major loss for the studio. 

Nolan needs his ego checked because I went from being ecstatic about the film, to lowered expectations to finally (upon seeing it) wondering how much was left in the movie about an hour into it.

g47n1ku,"I found this movie to be surprisingly bland.   Nolan has gotten better at filming and cutting hand to hand combat but I found most of the setpieces here to be wanting.  Unless you're like really into rewound clips of dust clouds, there's really not a lot going on here visually or action wise that found memorable.

The back half of the film, after they make the switch is a bit better, but overall I just wasn't very taken in by the reverse time conceit or at least Nolan's use of it.  

Also, as much as they talk about inverted rounds and such, it never really seems like they really get used in the way that Washington is trained early in the film.  You only really see them being used by people that are themselves inverted.  

There are stretches of the film, that I enjoyed just in terms of general ""Spiess and Suit Porn"" as Nolan continues to scratch his Bond itch.  

I continuously felt that the film intended for me to be much more invested in the plight of Elizabeth Debickies character than I was.  I truly did not give a shit if she ever got to freely be with her son.  Dom Cobb she is not. 

The Razzies are bullshit but I hope they heap every possible award on Kenneth Branagh.  Just terribly miscast with a Rock and Buillwinkle level accent.

Its not a bad movie at all, just expected more from a Nolan movie. It's a long way off Inception, Memento and The Prestige. His only film i'd definitely rank it above is Insomnia.

The opening opera scene feels like a very underwhelming setup just to get him captured when it literally could've been anything else for when he sees a reversed bullet. The way characters randomly just drop in one after another is very hard to keep straight of for what purpose they serve. Him even finding out about Tenet is laughably actually TOO simple in this movie with so many freakin' ideas. The whole painting subplot is a big ol WHY and I think where I officially started to turn on this movie.

The villain and his wife is just about the dumbest part , with him dying so therefore the world needs to end ""INCLUDING MY SON"" being one of the worst lines I've ever heard dropped in a modern film. I can't stress how much I disliked the villain so I'll keep going -- he delivers the LONGEST MONOLOGUE I've ever heard a villain give at the end with the lamest motivation, ofcourse all under that awful accent so you can't understand shit anyway -- just for him to die so ""pew pew, fall.""

I wish this was something Nolan did in between Batman films where he still didn't have free complete reign over his movies. This is a very clear example of a very talented person not being told NO. Believe it or not, studios have saved hundreds more of movies than they have destroyed them with meddling, and this is a movie they could've saved with rewrites for the sake of clarity if they simply didn't think Nolan could do no wrong. If this were any other director, I feel like legions of fans and critics would be pissed -- Interstellar's REALLY dumb ending is another example of him going far too Shyamalan, but until Nolan absolutely ruins a beloved childhood TV show, I guess nobody's eyes will be opened. Don't get me wrong, I think literally everything he did from Memento to even TDKR was an absolute 10, but I've seen a huge downfall in quality each picture since than.

I wish I could say, ""at least it looked cool and had great action,"" but even that I wasn't that impressed by. Inception is far and beyond a way more impressive film. Yes, it's great everything is practical, but ""things go reverse (!!!)"" is not that cool of a gimmick for me. And the only time I felt like they truly took advantage of that concept in action was the fight scene with himself and where they blew up that building in the end. The car chase was fairly standard, except, ya know... ""oooooh backwards."" I'm sorry, but was it Bad Boys 2 level of crazy? Give me something like that partially backwards -- that will wow me. Opera opening was ""meh,"" and if I could be completely honest, that plane crash was WAY OVER HYPED. It just... rolled into a building. And the plane itself didn't even take that much damage. Every damn trailer, featurette and article before this movie was ""OMG YES THEY CRASH A REAL PLANE."" And? Did you see Lost or War of the Worlds where they SHREDDED a real plane? Those were both after the fact, but even that was still more impressive, FOR ME.

Almost forgot to mention JDW because sadly, he is just flat and forgettable as an actor. I took Blackkklansman as maybe ""early actor nerves"" but even that, he had more liveliness to him. There's just no emotion in his face, which is especially disappointing considering his father's many amazing performances -- I hate to compare, but that apple fell VERY far from the tree. The repeated talk about ""I'm the protagonist,"" is so on the fucking nose, it HURTS, and his performance on top of that just made it worse. Pattinson had good charisma, I actually enjoyed him. Dibecki was given a fairly terrible script -- not that she was bad, but her entire character was awful, so \*shrug\*. And the less said about Branagh, the better. Then there's like 20 other characters, who tf knows what they did, including Kick-Ass who was completely wasted in this film under that beard AND a mask.

Anyway, I think taking out a lot of characters and subplots and changing the villain would've done wonders for this. As of now, I'm just deflated by it. Easily Nolan's worst.",im7etj

g49s9qg,"I saw this last night and the thing the struck me about the film was how bloodless it was. Like in the opening scene with everyone gassed out in the auditorium, in the meantime there's a gunfight going on. It would seem logical (as well as crank up the stakes on the whole scene) for some of those bullets to strike some sleeping audience members.

Later, the protagonist kills a man with a cheese grater to the face and again, no blood. A kill like that should make me wince more.

I get it, Nolan has to have the movie come in at PG13 if he still wants his big budgets, but this movie definitely needed more violence to really hit home.",im7etj
g7ony73,"Hey I just saw this movie and I fucking hated it I fell asleep in the art gallery scene and the only reason I woke up was because of Nolans signature wubwub

&#x200B;

Everything happens at breakneck speed so there's absolutely no time to sit and digest what the fuck is happening.  It's alot of shot reverse shot dialogue with some hard to follow action sequences in it.

&#x200B;

Maybe it was the theatre I saw it is, but the only character I could kind of understand was Protagonist (shit name btw).  The rest of the cast were usually mumbling so incoherently, especially Pattenson, who I adore, but did not like in this movie.

g49mp99,"Just saw Tenet yesterday, a few quick comments:

\-love Nolan movies, feel like Inception is his best, and this just didn't rise to that level.  Inception had confusing ideas, but in the context of that film's universe, those ideas just worked.  Here, I felt like Nolan presents confusing ideas, but when a character (the audience) asks how something works, another character will just say ""trust me"" or ""go with it"".  I felt like that is the easy way out.  It would be like Cobb explaining to his team how time works when you get to the 3rd dream level, and rather than explain that 1 minute in dream world 1 equates to 18 minutes in dream level 3, he doesn't say anything but ""don't worry, it works.""  I'm sure if i re-watched this several times, i might be able to pick up on the more technical aspects of inversion, but with Inception i didn't need multiple viewings to pick that up.

\-while the scope of Tenet is bigger (saving humanity), i felt more invested in Inception by far (where the scope was just helping plant an idea in 1 person's head).  In the final sequence, despite the great musical score and the cross-cutting of the yacht/city scenes, I never felt like I cared about what was going on.

\-the score/dialogue didn't bother me at all.  I see some reviewers here saying they couldn't hear the dialogue for stretches of time...maybe it was my theater (a Cinepolis), but i heard everything just fine.

\-time travel movies always have plots you can pick apart and question, but I never understood how Kenneth Branagh's character, having communications with the future, could not have seen what his wife was plotting on the yacht before hand and had the upper hand.  Wouldn't he have been warned what she (they) were up to?  This didn't affect my enjoyment of the movie, but like I said, time travel movies always have questions like these.

\-all in all, really liked the movie.  As a Nolan fan, I liked better than Interstellar, not as much as Inception.  I do feel like once the car chase scene happens and the technical aspects of inversion take center stage for the rest of the movie, certain explanations about how things worked in the movie's universe were lacking, but then again, I haven't sat down and analyzed every scene for hours...I was just happy to get out and see a movie during Covid!",im7etj
g4am3ai,"I really enjoyed it actually. If you didn’t try thinking too hard it was the right complexity. I do think Nolan is self aware at this point. EVERY bit of exposition was either through a mask, on a boat, over the radio, or a combination thereof.",im7etj
g4czcb7,"This is just a hypothesis I came up with but>!Max is Neil and he’s know the Protagonist his entire life hence why he knows the Protagonist favorite drink. Throughout the film people who know about Tenet are careful to say only what needs to be said to avoid giving away too much information which could lead to them changing the algorithm. During the scene when Kat was on hospital bed after getting shot, Neil ask the Protagonist why he cares so much to save her, possibly, hinting how important she is!<

Edit: >!i just researched my hypothesis and someone else mentioned that Max could’ve changed his name from Maximilien to Neil by using the last four letters of his name and inverting (reversing?) it to hide his identity from the Protagonist !<",im7etj

g4jn50l,"I enjoyed the film but totally understand people's issues with it. As I usually have an issue with Nolan and the way he uses time, I actually understood thought most of it made sense (as much sense as it could) but I thought it killed some of the big action set pieces. He'd leave little hints about what was going to happen or throw in random stuff leaving me like wtf is happening here. Super frustrating to watch at times. Ludwig's score was excellent, and the movie itself looked gorgeous. I totally get why he wanted people to see this in theatres. Sure it's a better overall experience but I'm sure plenty would just turn it off halfway through the movie when they feel like they don't have a clue of what is going on.",im7etj

g4pd1d6,"I think I missed what exactly the algorithm would do. Can someone explain that to me? 

I understand that each nuclear superpower had a part of the algorithm, and that by the end of the movie Sator had completed it, and that his death would trigger it. I just wasn't clear on what exactly it would trigger.

Would a completed and enacted algorithm launch a bunch of nukes, or kill everyone in the present day with time science? It didn't terribly impact my enjoyment of the movie, as I got why total destruction was bad, it's just that I didn't catch if/when they told us what exactly would happen.",im7etj
g4pd5yh,"As most, I’m conflicted on what to give as a rating, but that only seems to shine a light on how terrible the rating system is. 
This movie made me think, and when entering discussion, there is a lot to talk about. The score was beautiful, interesting and new sounding. Great play with the inverse effect of the plot and with the sounds. 
Dialogue was difficult to understand at times. 
The opening scene was one of the best from the film other than the airplane or final scenes. 
I think once the Pincer Effect was explained, in my head, I would try to figure out every scene using that explanation. 
It was quick to pick up how it would start playing through previous scenes with this new information. 
Is the movie rewatchable? Definitely. 
How does it stand up to precious Nolan Films? Pretty low for me. Nothing compared to Interstellar. 
I enjoyed it, don’t think it was anything incredible other than a nice new interesting story with a good score. 
Robert Pattinson did great and love his evolution as an actor.",im7etj
g4pwgq4,"I have so many questions but here are my three biggest if anyone can help me out:

1. What did it mean when JDW says to Satie “Do you like opera?” How did that save him?

2. When Neil (Pattinson) fights the other guy in black at the art vault and pulls off the mask it’s JDW. But how can it be JDW if future JDW is already fighting him? Wouldn’t it be the other Neil? How are there three JDWs?

3. At the end, did Neil get to the other side of the door to open it for JDW?",im7etj

In the opening scene, it looks like the protagonist and his fellow CIA operatives are working for the people doing the heist (Sator’s goons). But they save their guy who has the algorithm part (how? Is he a part of tenet?) so I guess they’re not working with the goons? Then they go back into the van with the guy who told them to go in at the beginning (some line about “tell the Americans it’s time”), but the guy said “they’re not the same ones” after they got into the van. Wasn’t that the same van with the same guy that they came out of in the first place? I’m confused. 

Also, does Neil die at the end? Wasn’t he the one who took the bullet when that goon was gonna shoot the protagonist in the head? But we don’t really see when that happens and there doesn’t seem to be a sense of urgency when he’s walking away after saying he and the protagonist have been friends for a long time.

John Washington has been solid in everything so far but I found him (and other actors) to be dull. I really wanted to like this movie, but I don't. I do appreciate the sets, costumes, and planning/organizing that went into shooting this film. It did some good things but overall Tenet was a miss for me.",im7etj

g4c2w94,"I admire Nolan’s capacity for original, high concept, blockbuster fare but this was all of his worst impulses as a filmmaker exposed. Dialogue is nearly all exposition, all the characters lack character and are again just a vessel for a convoluted story. Nolan should hire a writer once he gets his story down on paper going forward. 

That said, some absolutely dazzling set pieces here but Nolan still hasn’t figured out how to marry his high minded concepts and his characters. This is a lesson he oughtta learned from Inception, but he actually just took those criticisms and put his foot on the gas here. 

A decent movie, but very flawed.",im7etj
g3ygh8q,"Deny it all you want, but in a year's time this movie will be circle-jerked all over this sub and for perpetuity.  Seeing a lot of initial criticism in a similar vein as Inception, and we see how well that movie aged.  I think Tenet will arrive at the same point once it's finished fermenting.  

By all means not a perfect movie.  The sound mixing complaints are very justified.  Nolan botching this again after TDKR almost seems inexcusable.

I feel Nolan tried to do something clever, critics saw him trying to do something clever, and since they caught him doing so they are going to shit on the film for attempting to be clever since they could obviously see him doing so.

But damn it if I didn't have a shit eating grin on my face for a lot of this movie.  We just got a James Bond flick where the antagonist was literally the future.  Don't nitpick and just enjoy it.  That building destruction scene in the third act was worth admission by itself.  I will probably go see this again, and then watch it half a dozen times on DVD to catch all the nuance, then read every circle jerk on here to catch anything else I missed.  

""I'd like to think this is the end of a beautiful friendship"".  It happens fast - which I think was kind of the point - but that definitely got me where the protagonist and the audience feel like they were getting to watch two men become friends, when in reality the whole film was one friend coming back to save the other and say goodbye.  You don't know when that moment will arrive in your life where you say goodbye for the last time, or the first time, and rarely are we given the time or do we take the time to appreciate either.",im7etj
g4azr4m,"Probably one of Nolan's worst movies, which is a shame because I love Nolan's work and I had high hope's for Tenet. But the dialogue was trash, just poor writing, making the actors performance look so flat. I couldn't care less about the characters since there was 0 character development. Could barely hear what they were saying, which made me soo confused about what was going on. I didn't even know what the ""WW3"" problem was and what the protagonists were trying to do. Nolan should really consider changing his preference of his audio cause it is just terrible, too much background noise. And finally, THE EDITING. Holy shit, why is barely anyone talking about the editing? Its probably the worst I've ever seen. It was too quick during conversations, making it feel so scripted and have no natural flow. Then, when it's in the middle of a scene, it'll just jump to another one in an awkward time, leaving you confused and wondering what happened between those two shots. 

Honestly, I'm very disappointed with this film and it's definitely Nolan's weakest, I give it a 6/10",im7etj
g3y51zc,"It’s like somebody watched a Christopher Nolan movie, decided he wanted to make one of those, so hired his cinematographer and fired his writers.

The plot was confusing and I felt no need to figure it out.

The main character was turbo-charged boring. I didn’t believe for even a second that he gave a shit about the girl. Or saving the world. Or breathing. I don’t think he disliked any of those things either. This was not the actors fault.

I sensed the dialogue felt almost like .. annoyed that you wanted a confusing story. It’s like he annoyed himself trying to make it confusing and it came through almost hostile to the audience.

The heist was kinda fun. The airport was definitely fun but took too long to set up. 

I actually had no issues with Kenneth Branagh playing an evil Russian. Robert Pattinson seemed to be the only one to have a remotely good time in this.

g3ytukc,"The dialogue was hard to follow; I’d have preferred to watch it with subtitles on in a home cinema purely because of the mix of accents. Even the British ones were hard to understand at times (and I’m British so it should be easy). This just made me more confused as the film went on.

The fight scenes just aren’t as cool and crazy as I think they’re supposed to be. The inversion “mechanic”, if you will, often made me lose track of the fight. I usually love a bit of high quality choreography but when one guys going backwards it makes it looks messy more than anything even if the mechanics of it are probably really difficult to plan.

Story also moved way too fast. The word Tenet opens a lot of doors? From what I saw it opened one door right at the start of the film.

Robert Pattinson seemed to show up with absolutely no introduction whatsoever after the main character just jumped around talking to random people.

I actually wish the film was about an hour longer (yes I know it was already two and a half hours long) just to get the pacing right.

I also watched it in IMAX and the speaking volume was at a good level but the fight scenes were inconceivably loud. Maybe it’s a fault of the cinema but maybe the audio wasn’t put together well.

I thoroughly enjoyed the film, I enjoyed the confusion and trying to piece things together with my girlfriend, I enjoyed seeing visuals and concepts I’d never seen before, I enjoyed the epic and massive soundtrack completely engulfing and immersing me in the spectacle of the film and I’m super stoked to watch it again. 

I love to leave a movie with questions that force me to rewatch, I love to chew on scenes and think through connections like the charm on Pattinsons backpack at the opera showing back up in the end etc. I think I love this film, I got everything I could have wanted from a Nolan flick and left with a similar mind-bent excitement as I did when I left inception a decade ago.

g45o7et,"Tenet is a delirious, exhilarating ride with some of the best action I've ever seen. Every minute hits with sensory assault and spectacle, with mad scientist plotting that flies too close to the sun in a way only Chris Nolan can. As a film it falters, but as a""CINEMA!"" experience it is magnificent. However, Tenet was the wrong movie to reopen cinemas: it's arty blockbuster on the chassis of Nolan's least accessible, most oppressively icy film. What it reveals in Nolan's strengths with concept, style and action, it exposes in his weakness with character, plot, dialogue. It is a bizarre medley of mastery and misstep. 

It is a deliberately opaque movie; murky rules are quickly established and just as quickly broken and a plot that makes little sense via visual or muffled dialogue. The characters, or lack-thereof, are husk-people that lack psychology, arcs, change or catharsis. Lacking catharsis is key, as all of Nolan's movies climax with an ""aha"" feeling of cohesion tied to character (reunion, revelation, etc) so when Tenet gets where it's going, you feel ...empty. There's an unrelenting hollowness to Tenet that's both blessing and curse, and while I engaged with that despairing chilliness, it's another door the general audience may not walk through. 

Most disappointing of all is that Tenet is the first Nolan film without a soul. The biggest disappointment isn't that its quantum maze is confusing--I loved feeling lost in its tangled web--it's that the ambiguities you're left with are technical rather than philosophical. It's a dazzling, alienating puzzle, and what innuendo of depth and meaning may sit beneath Tenet's temporal seas, is ultimately handwaved in its rush to the credits.

For instance, there’s this fascinating implication Sator believes he's actually saving the world, like John Conner trying to save the future by sending Kyle Reese to nuke the past. It's a fascinating set of affairs, especially when he seems to be an actually caring father, but this revelation is a throwaway line in a busy climax and never mentioned again. Bizarre!

Everyone does good work down the line, performance, lensing, score, but most impressive was Nolan wielding the exquisite visual control of Dunkirk and applying it to heists and car chases, and the time-inversed fist fight is the best brawl since the bathroom in Fallout. All in all, it's a visual and somatic thrill that doubles as a minor disappointment and his worst movie since Insomnia. 

It's an 8/10 from me.",im7etj

The relationship between her and the protagonist, and her constant ""... my son"" seemed shoehorned in. And a lot of the plot comes off as nonsensical. 

But it made enough sense to where I could follow the big picture, and that in addition to the spectacle was enough for me. It's like Nolan found a way to make a ""just turn off your brain and enjoy it"" movie by just overloading your brain completely.

Oh, and I *really* want to know how the hell they filmed the fight scenes in the Oslo paining warehouse, that was incredibly impressive.

I have no idea what the plutonium or painting subplots were about. Or what was so special about the indian woman. Or about how taking the women back in time was going to save her life. 

And then right when I started to figure out what was going on...that last fight scene started and I was totally lost again.",im7etj
g56747p,"This is my third watch, all in different formats (IMAX, Dolby, Screenx) and I cannot have enough of this movie. I love that you have to look at the subtleties to figure out what is going on. I agree with others comments about muffled dialogs which makes it harder to understand the plot, but there is always a reason within Nolan. That’s how he makes his movies. Some people like it and some don’t. He doesn’t need to deal with that and (IMO) that is fantastic! I love complicated movies that make my brain melt and this one fits right there.",im7etj

g4mp2n9," TENET Review: Christopher Nolan's latest film confuses depth with complexity.  He wants so badly for it to be profound, but it is actually a ludicrous mess.  The film is basically ""Inception"", minus characters we care about, and exchanging layered consciousness for time reversal.  There are times during the film's final third that are more confusing than listening to someone explaining string theory in ancient Sanskrit... backwards!  At some point, I just stopped caring entirely.  I am sure there is a Nolan fanboy out there who will spend the next couple of months trying to explain away all the plot-holes with well articulated points.  Please let me not meet that guy!",im7etj

g3yvnhb,"I just saw it as ‘bill and ted but serious.’ The way they have to ‘guide’ past selves but not not reveal whats happening. 

As others said, alot of dialogue is muddled- you zone out often. Too much exposition and story to tell, to the point theyre teleporting everywhere like GoT, but still staying in the story-moment. 

Why is the world at stake? Isnt that only meant for literally every superhero movie nowadays? Villain is ‘cool’ but his drive is so stupid. Protagonist nvr shows emotion is why you dont care for characters. Youre following a robot with no stakes.

Interesting watch, not at all on par with Nolan’s other stuff.",im7etj

Other than that I enjoyed it and was glad to be back at a theatre. There was no one in my show except for my friend and I",im7etj
g4ai8h2,"Liked it, but can't shake a feeling of some wasted potential. The concept is interesting and brilliantly executed at times but is held back by a frustratingly distracted storyline. Some thoughts:  
* We get a ""don't try to understand it, just go with it"" message early on (heavy Looper vibes there), and then spend a lot of exposition over the course of the movie explaining how stuff works. The fact that the result is so visual (easy to see what is going backwards) I feel like a 'show don't tell' approach could've been utilized to greater effect.  
*  My biggest gripe would be the contradiction between the stated stakes and the character's (mostly the Protagonist's) decisions. Near the beginning we are told the gravity of the situation, that the fate of the world is in the balance. Yet despite that, the Protagonist repeatedly risks mission success to help one lady and her child? Talk about a conflict in interests. I was expecting a twist where is Kat is revealed as more important to the plot, or alternatively a self sacrifice, especially after they let her in on the stakes.  
*  Sator has to be the weakest antagonist ideologically that I can recall from a Nolan movie. ""If I can't have you, no one can"", cue eye roll. Branagh did good job it potraying a menacing arms dealer, but that doesn't exactly line up with end of the world stakes and motivations of the future faction that was funding him. There was hint of this in the monologue about the state of the future, which I thought could have become a compelling commentary on our lack of action to combat global warming, but instead never came up again.  
* Many sequences seemed to go nowhere and only add to the confusion. There's a 'straightforward' story in there, but we kept getting distracted. What was the point of the opening scene in the opera? Just so the Protagonist can name-drop it later on? We even saw a inverted bullet/soldier there, so ostensibly something relevant was going on. They were extracting some VIP (and we're told they failed) but this never comes up again unless I missed it. Then we have the whole subplot with the blackmail painting and heist attempt. As far as I can tell, the characters on the first pass truly were trying to obtain/destroy the painting, but as soon as the inverted versions attack this just goes out the window and has no importance from then on.  Then there was the ""I'm going to slit your neck, cut off your nuts and suffocate you with them"" to sailing buddies section. Why take the time to make them enemies if they just end up working together immediately after?  
* The inverted fight at the airport was badass.  
* The ending sequence was a bizarre jump in scope. We go from a few agents with limited info in spy-game style thriller, to a full blown regiment of marines in a war movie. The sequence had some good shots (the solider getting 'hit' by a repairing wall, the building get hit by rockets from both inversions), but mostly I felt it was unintelligible chaos with a lot of stormtrooper aim.  
  
Overall I liked it but pick either super secret Tenet spy-game heist movie with lower stakes (just keep an arms dealer from getting weapons grade plutonium maybe?), or full blown military involvement with end of the world implications. Direct opposite of Inception where we get concept > character motivation > plan > execution > complication.",im7etj
g4dv697,"Ok, so who here believes Neil is Max? 

Evidence that points this way:

MaximiLIEN spelled backwards gives us NEIL. In an interview, Chris Nolan hinted that Neil probably isn't RP's character's real name.

Apparently the little coin that Neil's Red tag is attached to is a VIETNAMESE coin....

Two pretty big things to me. I also found it interesting that Neil is the one who gets the final voiceover lines and not the Protagonist. 

For me, I honestly believe he is Max",im7etj
g4m2k3y,"I saw Tenet today at the cinema and i would like to express my opinion about the movie. First of all, i ve heard lots of people complaining about the sound of the movie. I honestly think the musical score was INCREDIBLE and cinema speakers make the experience so much better. The plot is very clever and the scenario was well written. I would prefer the movie to be 2h long though. The last 1/3 of the movie is kinda tiring. Also, the constant time travels back and forth after the half of the movie makes it so difficult to keep up with the plot. I think it’s my least favorite Nolan film, but still a good movie. I would give a solid 7/10 mostly for the musical score. The cinema experience of this movie was fantastic and i would go to watch it again, but only at the cinema. I don’t think i would watch this movie on my TV.",im7etj

gb6fui1,"Wasn't feelin it. I was ready to unplug my brain and enjoy the ride when it started getting confusing. But for a movie that relied quite heavily on exposition, the dialogue chugged along faster than I could comprehend them. With of course, the sound issues on top of that.

Nolan' previous successes worked for me because I was tied to the motivations of the characters. So no matter how buck wild his stories or set pieces got, I was attached to the human element at all times. 

I didnt care for these characters despite trying to. And their motivations seemed present on paper. But their emotions never got through to me.

The only interesting thought that I had the whole film is that im curious to watch the entire movie backwards in rewind and see what happens.

Overall, its a nah for me. Still a Nolan fan tho

EDIT: After reading more comments, i think i found my main beef with this movie. All characters in this movie seem to interpret and express information in the exact same way. No one has any wit, or charm. Nobody speaks in metaphors or wise analogies. Nobody morphs any of the information to and by their personality at all and it makes everyone seem robotic. Take the arms dealer for example. She is wise because she's older and experienced. If she had ended her explanations with metaphors to summarize the info for both Protag and the viewer it would have added to her charm as a sort of Guide. Its a shame the humanity is really missing from this film.",im7etj

g3zhfni,"I think Lee Smith being brought back as editor would have really helped this film, as the pacing and cuts felt extremely off at certain times. I’m not sure why Nolan chose Jennifer Lame, who has had no experience on action sequences prior to this film. Maybe to try and bring a more emotional depth to the characters?

Well, that didn’t work out too well, as I found myself uninterested in the characters fates in the slightest, besides Neil. This film could have used some test screenings, and an Inception like element regarding Kat or The Protagonist, to actually make us care about these characters.",im7etj

With that said, I had a similar experience to most others: inaudible dialogue; heavy, inorganic exposition; confusing plot; lack of emotional core; and lack of caring about leads and their stakes. 

The concept actually ended up being much simpler than I thought going in. If I'm being reductive, it was a time travel movie with the emphasis on the travel.

Also didnt get the gripe with the sound mixing. Heard everything fine. Its a very ambitious movie with a very fundamentally difficult concept to understand and watch happen on screen which is why In the end I dont think this movie can be fully appreciated in one viewing. Just like Inception, the first viewing is for the overall experience and wow factor. The second viewing is for a better understading and appreciation for the details and perhaps discovering the little plot points etc that you may have missed the first time. Whether you liked it or not I just dont think one viewing does the movie justice. I dont think that makes the movie worse because it takes more than once to fully absorb, I think that speaks to its high level of complexity which didnt actually manage to dilute the entertainment factor.

g4iidfh,"Spoilers below:

6/10, mildly interesting popcorn action flick with a poorly developed plot that's supposed to be carried by a gimmick - and an inconsistent, poorly thought out gimmock at that.

The characters are completely uninteresting, their motivations unclear. This isn't helped by the fact that the score was deafening.

The score, while we're at it, is poor at best. Standard action movie DUUUUUUUUNS mixed with an almost constant drumbeat that varies only in volume. There's no noticeable diversity in music. No quiet, somber moments. Just nonstop intense nonsense.

The inversion gimmick seems like Nolan realized halfway through that it wasn't going to work and just kept on with it. The movie even has a character say not to think too hard about it. It's full of oddities like the temporal inverse of fire being ice? No, that would be the physical inverse. When you invert a fire starting, you return it to its original state, which was just not being on fire. There's countless other examples of Nolan not understanding, or willfully misunderstanding, his own gimmick.

ACTUAL SPOILERS

The plot boils down to big bad weapons dealer is going to die and wants to kill everyone with him. The good guys identify a guy who they think is capable of doing the spywork necessary to stop the weapons dealer, not that we get any backstory on him at all. Said Protagonist is apparently a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, trained spy, metallurgist, and intimately knowledgable of global weapons dealers and politics, but can't hold up a conversation with a rich person without instantly giving himself away that he's not rich? In the end, Nolan reveals that the leader of the good guys is the Protagonist himself! But from the fuuuuutuuuuure! Wow, if only that wasn't the exact plot of The Terminator, right down to the Reese analogue! Or god damn Interstellar, while we're at it...

I consider all of that to be pretty par for the course for this kind of action movie. The effects were good, and the inverted fight scenes, though nonsensical and inconsistent, were at least enjoyable. It's not something I'd have any interest in seeing a second time but it was amusing if you turn your brain off and just accept it for what it is.",im7etj

The plot is entirely out of reach throughout, and the only scenes that are meant as exposition, are so poorly mixed, or consumed by terrible attempts at what I assume are quips, that nothing is adequately explained.

The casting is entirely distracting - Branagh is the most distracting western villain with an eastern accent since John Malkovich in rounders (only without being self-aware), Washington goes full Denzel in his affectation in ways I haven’t seen him do before, Aaron Taylor Johnson makes it painfully obvious the role was meant for Hardy, and Pattison is such a projection of Nolans image of himself, it becomes sad.

This film has all the tropes of films from Nolan’s past, the in your face costume design, the obscuring of mouths, the high concepts, the wooden female characters, the Michael Caine (that goodbye sir  Michael line was far below any of the people involved in this film) and the big set pieces. However, the thing is, these can usually culminate in good films with Nolan, because they’re combined with likeable, empathetic, multi dimensional characters . This film was such a mess, I could barely understand who the characters were or what they wanted, leaving me no chance to empathise or care about their stakes, all I was left with was waiting for it to end so I could go home and watch Dunkirk or even the dark knight rises instead.

I’ve only seen a few newly released films in 2020, this was down there with the worst of them.

This film is pretty good. Hell I loved that big battle where we watched both sides duking out past and present. However, the sound is off and not designed for most theaters. This will be much, much better if the audio is fixed in some way.

Nolan, again, tries way too hard to make something simple into some complicated story. We literally saw this with Inception, the issue is this time the sound is fucked.

g4fywpc,"I saw it last week in 70mm IMAX in Indianapolis, and really enjoyed it. Great presentation that fills your field of vision. I love the movie and could tell within a few minutes that it's one of those I want to rewatch multiple times to understand and fully appreciate. Among Nolan's other films, I'd probably say it's closest to Memento in theme and structure (albeit taking place on a much bigger scope and scale of course).  It would be fascinating to see some behind-the-scenes videos, since there are many shots which would've been difficult to film due to the stunts involved and/or the reverse-time elements.

I am a bit more sensitive to sound than most, so the opening sequence (which drops you right into the action and doesn't let up for quite some time) was very unnerving, but I was able to get used to it after a bit and enjoy the rest of the movie. The sound design and effects were on point, but as many reviewers have noted, the dialogue was hard to make out at times.

That's nothing new when it comes to seeing Nolan movies, but the difference here is that this film is more non-stop in its pacing and doesn't give you the luxury of as many slower scenes to get some exposition or take a breath and reflect on what's happening. There is a lot of 'show, don't tell' here, and what little explanation we get is mostly done on-the-fly. This is an unapologetic and distilled action thriller (similar to Mad Max:Fury Road in that regard), so if you're looking for more 'emotional weight' or backstory you will likely be disappointed.

As far as the music and soundtrack go, there are some interesting musical choices, but also many of the [typical bombastic fog horn type sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aT_oEhIKo) so commonly heard in movies and trailers, and not much in the way of melodic/thematic development, so it wasn't my favorite soundtrack. I might say the same of many of Nolan's other movies though, and I'm not the biggest fan of Hans Zimmer and his style/school of soundtrack composition, so you can take that with a grain of salt.",im7etj
ge0hoit,"Aside from the audio issues from not being able to hear certain conversations. I feel like this movie is 9/10 in terms of film. 

You gotta remember, although you never watched the movie, it has already happened. 

Each new scene that you see is a scene that has already happened in the past. 

The main theme is time travel, however, a major side theme is parallel universes. 

Back To The Future is a great example, as the original timeline of Marty's parents meeting already happened. However, when Marty travels back in time, he creates a NEW past that he must now fix. This is in turn creates the same future of him and his siblings to be alive, however with the big side effect of his dad and Biff having switched roles. 

Overall, this movie is mind-bending and great if you watch it a second time and try to give it the benefit of the doubt of how much YOU can handle comprehending. 

9/10",im7etj
g9iwyvf,"I did not enjoy the movie.

1. It's too bloody violent. It takes an awful lot of nerve to film the opening scene they did in today's environment especially knowing what happened during the showing of one of his previous films.

2. I could not understand half of the dialogue thanks to that loud blaring soundtrack that carried on the entire movie. I think the purpose was to keep you from being able to realize just how weak the script was. If there were two minutes of dialogue with natural background noise, maybe it wouldn't have gotten such good ratings. Speaking of....

3. 7.8 on IMDB??? Really? I liked the concept of the movie with the inversions but it was horribly executed. I have to suspect shenanigans on that rating.

4. Never had any reason to care about a single character. Nobody resonated with me.

5. What's the deal with the artwork? It became a huge plot device and involved a real airplane. Exactly why does the artwork's existence keep the blonde from leaving psycho man? And why does stealing or destroying it make any difference. And why does Protagonist care? They failed in even trying to find it once they got inside the safe and everything still worked out just fine.  My theory is that Nolan thought it would be cool to ram a plane into something. Then he had to figure out why - to steal something. Then he had to figure out what - artwork is a popular thing to steal in movies so how about that. Then he had to figure out a reason to incorporate it into his inversion plotline and hit a dead end. And beyond that, the idea of using a jumbo jet for nefarious purposes seems pretty tone deaf since 9-11.",im7etj

Turnstile?

Okay. I’m on board. Makes sense. Reverses entropy, makes an object flow through time the opposite direction. 

Inverted vs non-inverted matter?
 Same thing. Easy to get ones head around, conceptually. 


What really cooks me is trying to picture the mechanics of inverted and non-inverted objects interacting, like an inverted person driving a non-inverted car, or an inverted bullet inside a non-inverted magazine.

My comprehension of the mechanics of this film will benefit greatly from the ability to pause and play in reverse on demand.",im7etj
g3ywekg,"This was okay.

I know it’s something of a hot take these days but I really like Nolan’s sound mixing decisions. They place you into the action, in an environment where you can’t exactly hear what’s being said and it makes it all the more thrilling. Really compliments his documentarian approach to camerawork.

I also know people like to say that Nolan “relies” on exposition. While I concede that his dialogue is mostly expositional, I’ve always found him to be a very strong visual storyteller. I can watch Inception on mute and still follow the story generally.

Music was great, and action was exciting.

Still, every director eventually starts to create self parody. This felt just like that for Nolan. I haven’t liked any of the movies he made this decade, fingers crossed this will be the end of the ‘low period’ of Nolan.

Still worth seeing though, if not for the masterpiece—for the adrenaline.",im7etj

Unlike rewinding a video tape, going backwards in time physically will cause so much difficulty in everyone's understanding (In fact many things will not work: You don't see lights and hear sounds, since all lights and sounds are leaving you).

Really interesting seeing some of these comments about how the ideas were portrayed. Yes, time constraints is going to be a challenge for literally any movie in existence that convey complex ideas, but that doesn't mean no director shouldn't try. 

A lot of subjects involving science or math tend to go over my head because I don't spend my time studying them. But just because I don't understand them doesn't make those subjects 'dumb' or 'confusing.' If I'm frustrated from not understanding those subjects, it's entirely my fault, and no one else's.

It simply means that I didn't dedicate enough time and patience to fully understand them. Same concept applies to Tenet. Or Annihilation. Or Primer.

g3z2nmt,"I think my local movie theater did a pretty good job at taking social-distancing/sanitation measures, but I still felt like maybe I was taking a bit of a risk by going to see a film - and I would now feel exceptionally bummed out if I caught COVID because of *this* movie.   There were some undeniably cool scenes, I thought Pattinson and Washington were coolly charismatic, a lot of the location photography was gorgeous...

yet how did Christopher Nolan get $250 million to make something so convoluted yet ultimately boring?  After watching and thinking about it for a little, I think I get 90-95% of the plot.  I don't think it was worth the effort to untangle, though.  I don't think movies have to be easy to understand right away - in fact, I love it when there's some narrative mystery and the filmmaker slowly reveals information to the viewer.  It builds tension, creates surprises, and can make you appreciate characters from a different perspective.  Nolan has done all of this well before.  I don't think any tension was created by this film's structure, though. Despite the convoluted central plot device, nothing felt surprising. There were barely any characters to care about in any light.  Lastly, I have always been annoyed with the murky mixing of dialogue in Nolan movies, but I can understand why some people don't mind it or even admire it - but in this movie, there are so many scenes of pure exposition!

g4vufty,"I saw it a week ago. I...hated this movie. I didn't even expect to hate it, I thought it'd maybe be just okay. Nolan's movies are quite flawed, and I'm not as into his films as I was at a younger age, not to mention his obnoxious fanbase, but I never hated a movie he put out, all of them have redeemable enough aspects to them, at least. This takes all of his tropes and flaws, and takes them 10x to the max. The expositional dialogue is constant, thus, shattering any a craft of a scene. Constant dialogue works as a language in movies such as The Social Network and His Girl Friday, but that's because every piece of dialogue says something about the character and themes under subtext. All Tenet does is talk about plot and state everything on the nose. Mind bending plot about time inversion doesn't add a meaning beyond the surface level or any emotional heart. There's a difference between plot and story, and this movie thinks otherwise. This movie looks at the bone of a pinky finger thinking it's the spine. It's a very shallow experience. It's not that I don't get it, it's that I don't care. I don't care about any of the cardboard cutout spies or anything. The cinematography is good, but it doesn't make the experience enjoyable within it's messy storytelling. The PG-13 action is noticeable, as the beginning shows a shootout where almost every audience member in an auditorium gets shot, and there aren't any exit wounds. It's not like an R rating would've compromised it's accessibility and marketing. And also, the fact that everyone gets shot in the auditorium is the most shallow and meaningless romanticized violence in a movie since Batfleck blasting people with a shotgun in BvS. You watch a John Woo, Michael Mann, or Sam Peckinpah movie, and the violence feels like it means something deeper. Even Tarantino's glamorized violence doesn't feel completely shallow. Some movies are meant to be ""felt and not understood"". It works in Inherent Vice and Twin Peaks: The Return. And while the plot being confusing and all wasn't my biggest problem, I did get distracted and bored by all the constant exposition and lack of substance that I didn't even know the who what where when why and how during certain scenes. This movie does nothing to make me care. And Branagh's villain's motives of wanting to destroy the world because he's old and dying of cancer is such a stupid motive. Every time his mouth moves and explains his motives or calls Elizabeth Debicki a ""bitch"" (in a bad Russian accent, but not nearly as bad as the Russian accents in the Black Widow trailer), the character becomes flatter and flatter. Branagh's motives, on top of the ""you can't save the future by looking in the past"" message and the protagonist being named that and even labelling himself as that (in one of the film's many unintentionally laughable moments, there's a lot of those. Nolan must've masturbated when he wrote that) is definitive pseudo intellectual filmmaking. Elizabeth Debicki wanting her son back is the most shallow and lazy attempt at any effort of character psychology imaginable. And the way the film is pieced together doesn't create much of a film language where every shot and cut means something or serves the story or character motivations (or in this case, lack thereof) whatsoever. I wasted my money on parking and an IMAX experience and all I got was this crap experience.",im7etj

I hated not being able to understand most of the dialogue in the movie, and especially one that drags on for 2.5 hours and ends in an ear-splitting shootout between, uh, I guess the good guys and some mysterious army that pops up out of nowhere?

Overall, it's not too difficult to understand the plot, having been used to watching many time travel sci-fi movies, but I might probably need to buy the Blu-Ray and re-watch the whole thing again slowly, especially the battle scene with the Forward Red Team and Backward Blue Team just to figure out how each individual scene works forwards and backwards.

IIUC, that algorithm device thingy is just a Chekhov's Gun which is never explained how it works, except that when blown up it causes some temporal explosion that destroys everything moving forwards and backwards.

There're many spy/crime thriller movies where we never know the protagonist's name, but he/she usually goes by an alias, but this must be the first major Hollywood blockbuster I've seen where the protagonist's name is never revealed (simply credited as The Protagonist), and other characters never address him by name, he doesn't even have any alias to go by.",im7etj

Also, I saw it with 3 people in a modern cinema and none of us complained about the sound mixing. I don't know where these people criticising the film's sound are viewing it, but I had no trouble. I personally like that Nolan regards your chair vibrating as part of the cinematic experience.

g42w4zq,"I saw it earlier today, really liked it. Not quite in the Nolan top 3 for me, but I'm fine with a visual spectacle and cool action.

JDW killed it, RPat killed it, Debicki did great (she's more of a ""gets the job done"" actress used for her stunning physical presence), and the only performance that wasn't all that was Kenneth Branagh as the villain. I guess it's not a big deal for most audiences, but I wonder if an actual Russian would've given a more convincing performance. Or just a better actor? Not saying Kenneth isn't talented, but I see him as more of a director than an actor.

The visuals don't seem too special at first, but once we started getting shots of mostly reverse-time it was really fascinating. I assumed the recorded things normally, played them in reverse and green-screened in the ""backwards"" people, but apparently that wasn't the case, which makes it even more impressive. Aside from that, the cinematography is quintessential Nolan and really sells the action.

Now, in terms of the plot, this is the elephant in the room. A lot of people are complaining that they have no fucking clue what's happening, the plot makes no sense, etc... my answer's dumb, but I think this is a movie where you can turn *down* your brain (not off!) and enjoy it perfectly. It's not important to know exactly what's happening physically, how inversion works, or how time loops make sense. As long as you're content to follow along with what's happening at a general level, the movie's fun. Like in the scene where Andrei shoots his wife, it's definitely a little confusing, but the important part is to understand that Andrei's using reverse-time and precognition to communicate bi-directionally, a clear display of his mastery over the technology. I know this won't satisfy some people, but what's the alternative? Trying to figure out how time loops work? My bigger complaint is that in terms of narrative, it's not always clear why JDW is in a certain place doing a certain thing. For instance, tracking down a painting - maybe I missed it, but what did that really have to do with saving the world? I guess it got us to the JDW vs. inverted soldier fight scene, which is the important part.

One last thought: I wonder if this movie would've been better with an R rating. Not for sex or language, but violence. Not only is this another movie where bullets fly everywhere and there's no blood, but time inversion isn't really sold off as a seriously lethal threat - which it should be. Like the idea of a bullet being reversed through you, piercing a perfect hole through you worse than any normal gunshot, they could've actually conveyed that in the movie. We get one scene of an inverse guy who gets crushed inside a destroyed wall (it got destroyed by a grenade, so to an inverted soldier the grenade's un-exploding and the debris is fixing itself, he's caught right in the middle of the reverse debris), but the camera of course cuts away before we really take it in. I wanted to see more moments like that! Maybe it could've been done without going too bloody and warranting an R. Regardless, the movie's worth checking out in theaters if you can do so.

Addendum: and yes, people were right about the audio mixing. Hopefully they can fix it on home release.",im7etj
g4a1rdv,"I was massively disappointed in this movie. It was a weak story, an excuse to string together some excellently shot and staged action sequences. The backwards motion, reversing time didn't look as good as the filmmakers thought it did. I didn't understand the plot, literally, the droning score and sound effects obscured much of the dialogue, many of the characters sounded like Bane. Which is a problem because the movie should've been called Exposition: The Motion Picture. It was convoluted that I didn't know who was fighting who at the final battle. The characters were flat, more broad strokes than three dimensional characters,  Branagh being the worst offender, he was cartoonishly over the top. I hope this isn't signaling a trend for Nolan, hopefully  in the future he'll create a better story with characters we can care about to go with his incredible set pieces.",im7etj

g4dwy0u,"Loved this movie so much.  I'm reading all the comments and I'm kind of shocked by all the hate.  I felt confused throughout most of the movie, but during the interrogation scene a lightbulb went off and I knew what they were going to do, and I pieced together that JDW was going to basically fight himself in the past/already fought his future self. So I guess I'm not feeling hatred for the story because it ended up making sense to me. I still need to see this multiple times to fully understand it, but I enjoy rewatching movies so I'm not going to hate something because it will require some rewatches.  

Visually this movie is simple put, amazing.  The lack of CGI is jarring because it seems all movies use greenscreens now, and this movie uses real locations as set pieces.  Real cars to crash, real stunts.  It was so refreshing to see it.  Can't wait to see this many more times.  

JWD is a star, possibly cooler than his dad.  Pattinson is the stand out, I loved him in Rover but hadn't seen him in anything else besides Good Time, which he is incredible in.  He is going to be an awesome Batman.",im7etj
g4fdp09,"My two cents: I surface level enjoyed it. I felt it was a glorified popcorn flick. Once you step back and start viewing the side characters, things get a bit shoddy.  I think with this film, Christopher Nolan has proven he is shit when it comes to sound mixing and engineering. He LOVES his masked characters, but you KNOW that once you see one, their dialog for the duration of the mask wearing is going to be unintelligible.

It was fun, but the convoluted ideas REALLY break down with very little scrutiny.

Plus the crazy concepts of objects moving backwards in time, something used heavily in marketing, is barely touched on.",im7etj

I dont know if the Imax I went too had a particularly bad audio setup or what but I was straining to hear what was going on in half the scenes I sat through,  and my hearing has always been excellent. The whole thing felt rushed, like someone was trying to see how many heist scenes they could fit into a two and a half hour film and because of the audio I spent half the time not knowing why we were where we were and why it mattered. 

The inversion gimmick seemed interesting but bares almost no scrutiny before becoming nonsensical. But hey dont try and understand it, feel it right? I got to where the evil rich guy caught The Protagonist snooping but decided to let him go anyway, at that point I realized the Protag was pretending to be an arms dealer?  I just couldn't be bothered with it beyond that. I'll have to try again with this one at home with some subtitles if necessary.

g497muq,"It certainly was good, though it wasn’t exceptional. The spectacle itself and the concept are both pretty mind blowing, though the dialogue and character work are iffy - everyone is pretty one dimensional and the villain was boring, and I could make a drinking game out of the walking in public spaces while spouting exposition scenes. 

That being said, I thought the concept itself was laid out nicely and I enjoyed following the paper trail as well as its payoff - especially in Oslo",im7etj

g4e6fm2,The action scenes were very well done and the music I felt was really good too.  Without the convoluted plot element of time though this would just be a generic action movie where the action sequences were really well done.  I didn't feel as if there was any emotional element of the characters or plot that had me as the viewer at all invested or caring about what happened to anyone.  It wasn't that any character was unlikable it was just that nothing was done to really make me care about any of them.  I give it a 7.8.  I would rank it 9th out of the 11 movies directed by Nolan.,im7etj
g4lj6p0,"So I didn't find it as hard to follow as most, but I really don't get how the idea of self works with the time travel thing.

We see Kat see her past self (forward) on the speedboat from the yacht, meaning there can be two forward moving Kats. Does that mena at the end there's two Kats and two Protagonists running around, one of which just a couple weeks older? Does that mean that when Kat and the Protagonist go back in time in Estonia, the version of them that already went back will be the version that keeps on living into the future?

Am i reading this right?

Also why does the past version of the Protagonist seemingly help the Russian guy when the Protagonist goes backwards through the freeway chase? Is there multiple universes/timelines here or am I just reading this wrong?

Overall I enjoyed it, despite the confusion (seconding who all those troops at the end were). The set pieces were awesome. Nolan's weakest dialogue, though, which is saying something. I'm still convinced the man doesn't understand human relationships at all.",im7etj

All the time inversion machines in the film work in real time, so how exactly does time travel work in this film ?",im7etj
g5famae,"When the Protagonist was fighting himself for the first time, what would've happened if he *did* kill his inverted self, and what would've happened if he knew that he had killed himself?  Obviously later on, he would still go through the sequence of events that led to that moment because it *did* happen, but if I were in his shoes at that moment, I would do everything in my power to not end up back at the airport.  Seems like a paradox, no?",im7etj
gafcvmi,the movie had too much kenneth branagh. I got sick of all the scenes with him. he would've been better more in the background through it. less is more for a villain like that especially one so one note.,im7etj
g3z4190,"Dang so Neil really is Kat's son. 

It's more clear on a re-watch as you notice things a bit more. The ending makes it more clear that Neil is Kat's son, how he says something like ""This is just the beginning of our relationship, you will get to know me a bit more"". Then it just cuts to future JDW in the car at the front of school seeing Kat and her son holding hands which is the final end scene. JDW has been fond of Kate throughout the movie and we can assume at the end they will have some sort of relationship which in turns JDW getting to know more of her son. Sending himself back in time to save the protagonist to complete the loop. What also blew my mind is when Neil said ""you're only half way there"" at the end scene, we've only seen half of the time loop, temporal pincer movement. 

To think Neil is just a random stranger that JDW recruits is a bit odd, especially for Nolan who likes to tie in things with a knot, but doesn't like to actually tell you 

also. [Christopher Nolan reveals that Robert Pattinson's character Neil could have multiple identities in Tenet](https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/christopher-nolan-reveals-robert-pattinsons-character-neil-could-have-multiple-identities-tenet-543659)

They even made Robert Pattinson dye his hair blonde which is odd for a movie unless you have a reason to do so. He's the kid.

Also Neil tells us he has a degree in physics, showing us he's well-educated. And we know that Max is well-educated: the film shows us the outside of his fancy Camden school in London, while Sator (Kenneth Branagh) even makes a reference to how expensive Max's education is.",im7etj

The music was sick. The dialogue at times wasn’t as important, and it is audible when it is important. 

It’s Christopher Nolan, man. He wouldn’t mess up sound editing 😂",im7etj
g3yo7el,"I loved it, the music was so great and I had been worried about the absence of Zimmer. The acting and rapport with John David Washington and Pattinson was top notch. I really enjoyed the use of locations you don’t see in films a lot also, like Estonia. 

It is not perfect though and I had a few issues. I didn’t understand how they would resolve there being two versions of people at once (after they went back in time at the end). But a kind redditor explained it to me. 

My other issue was that it was heavily telegraphed that the protagonist was fighting his future self in the hallway. Neal’s reaction to the mask removal and then the fighting being so evenly matched gave it away. I even whispered it to my best mate. 

My main issue with the film though was the lighting. I didn’t have an issue with the sound, but my word, the lighting was terrible. The shots themselves were framed beautifully, however John David Washington’s face was not lit effectively. Far too dark and often lit from behind. I’m not sure if the cinematographer has experience filming POC, however I found it pretty awful that in many shots of JDW in the foreground and Pattinson in the background you could see Pattinson’s face more clearly. In the torture scene at the beginning I couldn’t even tell how they were torturing him due to the backlighting until it was later explained they removed his teeth.",im7etj
g3ywuu8,Nolan has always put plot over character in his movie. In Dunkirk it was framed in the most complex way for a war film with no real character. In inception the major selling point or point of interest was the plot about how dreams within dreams work.

g46toyg,I feel like Nolan   really only cared about the visuals for this movie and nothing else.  He Either should of  hired another screenwriter fleshed our the story  and characters OR just straight up made a big budget experimental genre  film in the same vane as like 2001: A Space Odyssey or  El Topo  . Instead we have a visually impressive but kind of boring film,im7etj
g47emmi,"Definitely in the bottom 3 of Nolan's films. I'm a huge fan but genuinely worried for the future. It feels like he has no one telling him he's doing things wrong at this point. He needs a person that will tell him no, this doesn't work. 

The concept is really cool and creative. The action was decent but a little confusing during the climax, and lacking punch, which is a recurring problem in every movie he's done unfortunately, with the possible exception of Interstellar which had wonderful, tense action. The acting and score were ok.

The biggest problem was I had very little if any reason to care about any of the characters. Some scenes like Caines and the one where the villains wife almost kills the villain should have been scrapped entirely, and replaced with backstory about the protagonist and the villain, which seemed more interesting to me. I didn't feel any ideological conflict between them and that's what the film really needed imo. The relationship between Neil and protagonist was very lacking, which unfortunately ruined the potential of a tear jerking ending.

The script was a big mess which is surprising for Nolan. The time concepts were just too confusing and not reinforced enough, and the awful audio mix just made it even harder to understand the plot.

g3z7e13,"Since they have a similar nature I want to compare Tenet to Inception. In Inception the mechanics are plenty confusing but it is explained fully. In Tenet it felt like you were given some bullet points, and then the scenes and action were also doing the explaining, and you needed to be watching carefully to understand what in inception he would've used dialogue to explain, but in Tenet is using purely visuals to explain. Pretty genius if that's it. On top of that I am unassuming there are some true mysteries and unexplained elements as well. So overall Tenet has a very overwhelming effect.

Probably my favorite movie going experience for a Nolan film. This felt to me like the most action oriented film he has made, and on top of that one of his most complex plots. The intensity, suspense, action, soundtrack, everything was turned up to 11 this time. Blew me away. 

It is weird going through a movie and not really grasping a lot of the details. At some point I just went along for the ride, caught what I could, and just enjoyed.

So for instance when they needed to go back to the specific Vietnam vacation or whatever, were they living “in reverse” for like months at a time just waiting to get back to that day?  If JDW’s character started the entire Tenet organization, then did he live inverted for YEARS at a time to just go back far enough to start the organization and meet Pattinson?

This movie was as pretentious and douchebag-y as Christopher Nolan himself. 

First, this movie did not earn the right to call its main character The Protagonist. Just because “Fight Club” did it doesn’t mean you can, “Fight Club” was a good movie. We also cared for the Narrator in FC, whereas here JDW is given NOTHING to work with. 

I’m willing to give “Inception” the benefit of being good because that movie is actually good, despite a confusing unnecessarily ambiguous ending. “Tenet” was Nolan saying “see I’m smart!”",im7etj

Then I was a little bit high when I saw the post release trailer with a little more dialogue... and I thought ""oh no... it really is just a war movie.... about a war we havent had yet... ew, um Im not sure this is a good time for that.""

g51wgd0,"Overall I thought it was one the best films I've  seen in a while. Though probably one of Nolan's weaker films (likely around the level of Interstellar, but better than TDKR), but even a weaker Nolan film is still a really good film in it's own right. I liked that it throws you into the action  straight away and that the spies actually behave like spies (really making me wish Nolan would do a Bond film already) and that Nolan as per usual doesn't really feel like he needs to water down a high concept thriller in order to pander to his audience. Other positives include:

* John David Washington showing off a lot of leading man charisma and him and Pattinson having a lot of chemistry.
* Brangagh bringing a lot of intensity and menace to his roll, to the point where he basically dominates ever scene he's in.
* The film probably has the best choreographed action sequences Nolan has ever done thus far. Some of the choreography and camera work during the fights  in TDK trilogy tend to be criticized (particularly the TDKR choreography which is probably the prime example of Nolan's fight choreography at it's worst), but I think here, Nolan seems to be a lot more comfortable with flashier prolonged fight scenes  and has shown how far he's come in that regard. Even outside of the inversion sequences, the kitchen beat-down felt pretty brutal and was shot,edited and choreographed very well.
* Some absolutely stunning practical effects and stunt work
* Ludwig Göransson's score. It was never going to be easy for another cinematographer to fill Zimmer's shoes, but  Göransson manages to pull it off.

&#x200B;

The only significant negative for me was the sound mixing. It's weird to me that Nolan and Richard King can go from having some absolutely top-tier/Oscar Worthy sound design in Nolan's films (The Dark Knight and Dunkirk), but also have films like this and TDKR where the ambient sounds and music tend to be much louder than the characters voices (with it especially being hard to understand certain characters with thick Russian/Ukrainian or Indian accents).

&#x200B;

I also think people tend to unduly criticize Nolan a lot with one of the more unwarranted criticisms of his films being that they're cold and mechanical and lack an emotional center. Plenty of Nolan's films have pretty strong emotional cores (The Prestige, Memento, TDK, Interstellar, Inception, Dunkirk etc.) Though outside of the Branagh/Debicki relationship, the criticism is apt here since the characterization of the main protagonists  was intentionally quite cold in this film with only a few moments of real emotional bonding, which in the case of this film, I actually really appreciated, since for a spy movie,  an operatives detachment  and malleability is generally integral to their success and a lot of worse films end up trying way too hard to spoon feed the audience how likable a certain character is supposed to be (One of the more egregious recent examples of this in blockbusters was Chris Hemsworth's characters monologue about his family in Extraction or for a slightly less recent one that really rubbed me the wrong way, the Hulk/Black Widow scenes in Age of Ultron).",im7etj

So many people have this weird idea that movies like this need to be changed to suit their own personal preferences without ever considering the director’s artistic expression and choices.

g4pwol1,"Christopher Nolan uses the spy genre to compliment audience expectations and expand film language. Nolan has been preparing his audience for this film for 20 years. TENET is all about film language- the logical extreme of Nolan's style and aesthetics. He manages to strip down the film to the bare minimum of traditional film story telling while maintaining a narrative density most audience members struggle to keep up with. As with most good sci-fi concepts a stoned 16 year old could come up with, a good sci-fi concept encourages critical thinking and encourages the audience to apply the concept to their reality. The Sci-fi genre attacks the reality the audience understands using concepts and applying those concepts to characters. A different genre may attack reality with dialogue- complex conversations between well established characters. Nolan eschews Aaron Sorkin style knotty dialogue and instead uses concepts physically applied through drama. There is a basic morality assumed of the audience. The film assumes we care about the future- that we care about community and the environment. It assumes that we don't want the world to end and that we don't want loved one's torn apart. The characters don't have to explain that to us. If they did, it would just be theatrical artifice- or even condescending. 

In Nolan films, ethos, pathos and logos all inform each other. His films are always steeped in moral assumptions that are played with in the script. Nolan assumes we think Batman is a good guy, but is constantly asking us to interrogate that assumption in his Batman trilogy. The same can be said of many of Nolan's characters. 

&#x200B;

In the millennial generation, we often look at the boomers and say ""fuck you, why did you leave a destroyed world for us to inherit?"" But what if we could travel back in time to hinder those bastards from causing global warming, an inflation of corporate power and a strangling of artistic culture? We would probably do it. Now- what if the people from the future could seek revenge from the people of the past? We are encouraged to think about our posterity. What world are we leaving for our descendants? If they could, would they try to retroactively murder us for passing on a spoiled existence? Nolan conjures the arm chair philosophy we haven't seen since The Matrix (1999). It's goofy, nerdy fun sci-fi movies like this that get people thinking critically- that provide a safe space for exploring complex ethical questions. It's films like this that prepare us for the difficult questions we have to face in reality. It reminds us that our experience through this crazy life matters, that the difficult questions are worth pondering and that, as a community, we have to start answering these questions for the sake of all life from past present and future.

The whole conceit of TENET is focused on creating theatrical action- a sci-fi concept that is cinematic at its core. Nolan's tight action direction gives us thematic action which shows us the past interacting simultaneously with the future- there's no better playground for thinking about the consequences of how our behavior now affects people in the future.

I'm seeing a lot of comments about the plutonium sub plot, I mean it clearly was not plutonium


Essentially, some scientist in the future discovers a mathematic equation to reverse the entropy of particles. Since she realizes this information could lead to the end of the world so she decides to break up the equation into 9 parts and commit suicide so that the location of the artifacts containing the equation could not be revealed, they are planted somewhere in the past.


A faction in the future ironically to prevent ww3 wants to ensure sator assembles the artifacts so humanity does not exist, preventing ww3 (grandfather paradox) so they pass on information to the artifacts to him


He has all 9 due to the events of tenet and would have released the location of the artifacts had he committed suicide in Vietnam. This would effectively end human existence

1) The movie is just INTENTIONALLY confusing. Like a puzzle. You are obviously wrong, if you thought it's unintentionally LOL.  That's Nolan-style, and if you were a fan of his, you should known this. His work is always confusing, but acclaimed and respected due to how smart they are despite you are not gonna understand it at your FIRST viewing!!

Plus, majority of what people thought didn't make sense, actually **DOES,** after consulting with explanation articles/videos and thru /r/tenet. PERIOD.

It's not a bad movie just cuz you couldn't understand it. And, intellectuals do NOT want this style to change.

2) Likewise, the music and sound being louder than dialogues is also Nolan-style. That's just how he does it.


But, I think it's way **exaggerated** how dialogue was so hard to hear, you can't understand what they are saying at all.

**NO.**

Because, if you ever partied before. At clubs, at concerts, it's worse. I am pretty sure I can hear the dialogues in this movie much clearer than any of those I been to. **MUUUUUCCCCCCHHHHHHH!!!!!**

g4u1kqh,"I loved this movie. Everything was brilliant about it. The end made sense to me but i agree it was hard to follow the pincer movement.

Him feeling commited to protecting her stems from her opening up about the state of her life and he promised to help her because he needed something from her and then betrayed her by saving Sators life. He feels responsible for her well being because her life is now in danger because of it. Which is why she was shot. Which is why he had to save her. Also at the end she was the only one who could be close enough to kill Sator without suspicion.

I didnt feel the dialogue was clunky or questionable. Could you give an example? Also i dont mind that there was no romance because its in almost every movie since the dawn of film. Its nice to see a film where women and men have a human connection without love or sex being a part of it

Sorry if any of this sounds butthurt but i genuinely enjoyed it while respecting that it isnt for everybody, i am just curious about peoples explainations for why they didnt like it. 

Some people just seem not to get it while others complain about the sound of the speech. Others think they get it but dont at all. You are saying the story surrounding the plot was subpar. Not saying you in particular didnt get it btw just stating that there seem to be a mixed consensus on why they didnt enjoy it.",im7etj

When I got home I went and rewatched a few of my favorite nolan films. Yes this movie had an original idea. But what all the other Nolan movies did, which TENET did not, is make me care about the characters. Hell, I even cared for >!Bane at the end of Rises!<. 

This movie didn't make me care for anyone. I know there's a theory out there that >!Neil is Max or something!< but I just think it's people trying to make sense of a bad film.

g47y6j7,"Same. Music, visuals, and acting are all 10/10 easily, but the plot and themes and characters and emotional impact...borderline nonexistent, I'm tempted to give a 3/10 based on those. 

What it reminded me of the most are the worse Marvel films where the characters are only saved by the actors giving it their all, with none of their charm coming from the actual writing. Only, Tenet is much drier, almost unbearably dry at the other end of the spectrum in opposition to Marvel's customary never-ending parade of one-liners. 

At least Tenet has tension in its favor, but even then that gets detracted by the vagueness of the plot and the mountains of exposition and the mental computing the audience is constantly forced to do just to get an idea of what's going on. It feels to me like a lot of gimmick barely covering up a paper-thin plot, and the gimmick doesn't even have that great a payoff.

Like it’s one thing to want to save people but he took it to a way more personal level to the point of putting her ahead of the save the world mission which is not great writing",im7etj
g406l16,"The gatekeeping is already very prevalent (see /r/tenet for the worst of it) but I don't think it can hold up for that long. The gimmick simply has no internal consistency, and it's hard to say ""you just don't understand it"" when the director himself didn't either.

For the simplest example, just consider the bullet holes that are already there. When do those come into existence? When the object is initially made? When it gets placed in that location? What does that ""coming into existence"" look like?

Going a little further, even assuming those holes made sense, why are they travelling backwards in time now? Because that's clearly what's happening: an inverted bullet has hit that material and now that bullet hole is for some reason inverted despite it being of a material that is not inverted. Are we assuming that once something inverted comes into contact with something non-inverted, that it inverts it? Can't be, because otherwise the inversion would spread through all the material in the world out of one bullet. Also, how would a man be pulled back into a building by some inverted material from an explosion without getting inverted himself and blown outward by the blast? No internal consistency.

There are so many other holes in the internal logic that you can find if you look further. I feel like Nolan is rather aware of this (he has Pattinson effectively say ""don't try to understand it"") but I do feel it makes this kind of gatekeeping of ""understanding"" very easy to shut down.",im7etj
g405f8t,"That’s what I feel was my biggest knowledge gap for it. If I could hear it all or see subtitles, I’m sure more of it would make sense. In theory, yeah the movie makes sense but I don’t know why they’re doing certain things or how it works, I just know they do it and they succeed.",im7etj

This is about a fundamental breach of trust. She married Sator and they had a life together. Along the way she figured out who he was. The conned him (with the guy who made the forgery) and it was the ultimate betrayal of trust. It’s implied there was an affair and that the result of getting over on him is being unable to walk or speak. So he’s incapacitated him or even killed him for the interlude with his wife. At this point the other shoe has dropped and he no longer has to pretend to be this thing he isn’t with his wife. It’s misogyny personified where he owns her and views her as property. She is his. At the start it was by mutual choice, now by force. Her son is the price that must be paid. He leverages her love for her son and his criminal standing to keep her in line. The painting is her betrayal in physical form and his constant reminder to her that she is the root cause of her circumstance. All she had to do was keep the blinders on and hold him above all others. It’s almost biblical where she is cast out of his good graces for daring to question his motivations.",im7etj

g4548og,"My read is that they both start off at a disadvantage because they don't know how to fight someone who is moving the other direction in time. It really throws both of them off to see things happening that they find hard to process.

But by the end of the fight, in each direction, they both have a better idea of what's happening and how to deal with it, so they both gain the advantage over the other.

What's even better is that because they both start off badly but fight in to a position of dominance, they both win the fight in the direction of time they experience, whilst looking like they lose it from the other perspective.

That fight, seen from both directions, was the highlight of the film for me because of this detail.",im7etj

First as far as I understood it, Stalsk-12 and the opera take place at the same time (at least on the same day) and secondly and more importantly: the Protagonist (chronologically speaking) founds Tenet and gets to know Neil after the events of the movie and then sends Neil back to help himself against Sator.",im7etj
g4lpbys,"In the final battle Neil was part of the blue (inverted) group. In the middle of the battle, he inverts himself back to drive the truck with the ropes to pull The Protagonist and the other guy from the explosion.

After three guys decide to take parts of the machines to different places, The Protagonist notices the red trinket on Neil's backpack (the same trinket as with the dead guy The Protagonist saw earlier near the bomb). The third guy and Neil also have a couple of words about the door.

What I don't understand is this — Neil dying near the bomb means that he inverted a third time. Was it ever shown in the film? I though all three of them have flown away on helicopters?",im7etj

g4bo9oo,"Not a bad review, I can agree, but I think there kinda needed to be a fair amount of exposition since the movie moves at breakneck pace almost the whole time, which feels ironically occasionally slow because of the exposition dumps that just confirm what you were watching do that you can say ""oh ok that's why they were there, carry on."" 

I agree, not his best, I wish it did a bit more showing rather than telling, even the time mechanic could have just been chalked up to ""we have no idea"" but I still thought it was solid. I'd probably give it an 8, but I get where you're coming from.",im7etj

Brand’s emotional bit about love in Interstellar springs to mind.  A group of elite scientists, and the one woman on board has to be the one to make the highly emotional argument.  Brand allows her identity as a wife to outweigh her identity as a scientist.  And I GET what Nolan was going for, her monologue is the crux of the message of the movie.  But the way it’s written, and the fact that they made the only female on board deliver it feels like he uses her womanhood as a crutch. She forgoes science for love.

Similarly, Kat’s character identity is largely centered around being a mother.  Her love for her son motivates her. This is a very realistic motivation but clearly Nolan struggled to write her in a way that seemed natural and balanced.  And so we get weird lines where it feels like he wanted to remind the audience that she is a mother who loves her son... yanno, just in case we forgot.",im7etj

""The grandfather paradox is a paradox of time travel in which inconsistencies emerge through changing the past.[1] The name comes from the paradox's common description: a person travels to the past and kills their own grandfather before the conception of their father or mother, which prevents the time traveller's existence.[2] Despite its title, the grandfather paradox does not exclusively regard the contradiction of killing one's own grandfather to prevent one's birth. Rather, the paradox regards any action that alters the past,[3] since there is a contradiction whenever the past becomes different from the way it was.[4]""",im7etj

It's actually the other way around.  The backwards group moved backwards through time and debriefed, and the forward group benefited from that knowledge (they mention this in the briefing).  It plays with the perspective of time.  Though in reality the rules of this time travel would mean that you didn't need two groups for a 'pincer' attack...

The funny thing is from Neil's perspective, he ran inside, locked the door, got shot and died.

Does he really need to run in to lock the door lol? Like don't even do anything and the door would be open for the protagonist the whole time.

They're fighting the main russian dudes goons who are protecting the time capsule, though agreed that it's weird to not show them other than the main sidekick at the time capsule itself. 

I suppose they sent stuff back in time by reversing time and waiting it out until they hit the point in the past they wanted...just like the protagonist did in the third act of the film. It wouldn't have to be a person, just the reversed item as that would sit where placed and move backwards in time.

There were a lot of cuts that just didn't make sense. At 2.5 hrs they were trying to save time? But there were also stuff that could be trimmed. He likes doing chinups? Gotta make sure we see that.

Wait a minute...",im7etj
geudko0,"I'm going to piggyback on this comment because you brought up some major points.   


Editing: I thought it was terrible, unlike other Nolan movies that have a larger scope. Washington's character is walking around India, then instantly walking around London, and so on and so forth. It was jarring, and totally unlike the fantastic editing we saw in a film like Inception that had quite a bit to set up prior to the major dream sequences happening.   


Characters: The only character I really liked was Pattinson, and even then we don't get enough of him to feel like there's any sort of emotional attachment. I really feel like Washington was miscast in this. This has nothing to do with diversity or anything else, I would be thrilled if rumors were true and Idris Elba was the next Bond; Washington just didn't have a PRESENCE in any of these scenes, I can't figure out whether it was writing or acting, but the character just didn't work for me, and I know he has the acting chops. In general, I think a great movie has to have characters (both protagonist and ANTAGONIST) that you WANT to see on screen. This seems like common sense but it is incredibly hard to achieve. The best examples I can think of off the top of my head would be The Prestige, The Dark Knight (if we're talking about Nolan) and for non-Nolan would be No Country for Old Men, or any of the first three seasons of Fargo (especially Season 2).   


Scope: For a globe-trotting movie about preventing the end of the world I have never felt a movie to be so small and narrow in scope. Yes, they were allegedly preventing the end of the world, and it took multiple international locations (and points in time) to do so, but the movie didn't FEEL that large. I will think on this some more, but I am not sure how he could have matched the story/settings to the scope he was trying to convey.   


Plot: I was seeing how everything was fitting together, but I think there's a difference between a movie I WANT to see again to get 100% of the story, and a movie I NEED to see again. I think for most people it was the latter, and this is an issue. There are little tidbits in Inception that most people wouldn't catch in a first watch, but they still ""get"" the movie, and this doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment. I think Nolan is intentionally trying to get far too complex in some of the concepts and story elements, and now people are having trouble enjoying his movies. This doesn't mean that some people don't love this, but there IS a point where a story + concept combination becomes too convoluted to get AND enjoy in the first watching, and I think Nolan has reached that point (and I believe a majority of critics agree with this).   


I've been following Nolan for so long now...but I really feel like his last three movies have been disappointing. I will give this one a rewatch though, and perhaps this post may need an update.",im7etj

People are looking way too hard into this film almost like they WANT to find flaws 

Nolan I bet did a lot more research and writing and rewriting on this then any of us can imagine, especially and obviously because of the crazy mechanics of the plot.

If I were a betting man, I’d say things people thought were illogical or what have you, were meticulously and doubly checked by Nolan and his team, and on further watches we’ll realize that Nolan had a firmer grasp than realized 

I mean think about it, with this plot, you’d have to go over every single detail over and over again, from beginning to end, constantly changing things because of the time/plot device, and I doubt Nolan would want it to be sloppy 

It may come off as too complex and over the top, therefor a lot of it was forced, but I bet upon multiple viewings it all adds up and is fine. 

He also, worked with physicist kip Thorne who assisted him on Interstellar, and if you don’t know they just from math and precious research, created essentially the first ever look at a black hole, which had never been seen before 

Low and behold years later (recently) we got our first ever pic of a black hole, and guess what, it looked EXACTLY like what they came up with 

Nolan does his research and knows his shit, call it pretentious, I call it passionate 

If that don’t convince you, think about how he’s the only dude who can get the budgets he gets for these insanely creative and original projects, AND that he released this almost guaranteeing and KNOWING he’d lose a massive profit

I'd say the characters and their personalities were half-baked. Lots of telling and not showing, like when Michael Cane set's up Sator's marriage. In the end when she's trying to trick him with a touching moment, it's hard to understand that they're genuinely kinda in love because we were only told they were having a hard marriage and that's it.

**Additional Pros:** 

It's quintessential Nolan, catering to his fans. Sits neatly between Memento and Inception by crossing a challenging achronological plot with massive blockbuster appeal. 

**Additional Cons:** 

Pacing was poor. Film was rushed throughout, but particularly in the first quarter's exposition, which gave no time to let the audience connect with the characters/drama. It seems like they simply wanted to make a movie twice as long as the studio/any theater wanted. 

The over-emphasis on plot exposition led to a total lack of exposition for The Protagonist as a character, aside from ""CIA agent willing to die for his cause."" This hindered the film later when they attempted to sell his interpersonal relationships with other characters.",im7etj

There's a couple points that I disagree with and think you might have missed some important details, but you should know that this point is wrong.  The Grandfather paradox is commonly discussed paradox.

You almost got there. Yes, if you go back in time and kill your grandfather, you never existed and you are essentially dead.

He said that there was no way the villain dude could confirm the info he told him, so he lied about the location since he saw that there was no second bullet hole in the room or in the woman. His gamble was that he could have shot her again either way, if he told him the info or not, but he didn't shoot.

> They talk about the grandfather paradox, but its not really a paradox.  If you kill your grandfather your father won't be born. And ""you"" won't  be born. 

The grandfather paradox here was that since they're still alive at a time much after Armageddon was supposed to end the world, then they must've succeeded at stopping it, but they don't actually know for sure (but apparently Neil does but he doesn't say anything so it probably means that he's not supposed to in order to stop the Armageddon) and they still have to do it even if they know its gonna get stopped.

g4tn6q0,"This is what I think...

The Algorithm is comprised of those 9 metal pieces we have seen, and it is the ""formula in physical form"" of how to create time inversion technology. If the bad guys from the future obtain it, they will master the reversal of entropy and begin destroying the past by inverting everything they possibly can. This was explained by Neil in the shipping container.

The bad guys from the future want to do this because their Earth is environmentally destroyed, and they feel they have no choice but to try this regardless of the Grandfather Paradox.

The bad guys from the future cannot do this because the scientist who invented inversion technology killed herself and sent the Algorithm backwards in time. Sator has recovered all of these pieces and uninverted them so they travel forward in time again.

Now, to the final battle. The bad guys/Sator's plan is to seal the Algorithm in a capsule in the ruined city.  If Sator succeeds, then the bad guys in the future can dig it up in their time and learn the secrets of entropy. That container that the goon was trying to drop the algorithm in was the capsule. The bomb in the rock would seal the Algorithm there for the future bad guys. This is why in the briefing, Ives said they had to fail to disarm the bomb, but retrieve the Algorithm without Sator knowing. That way, when the future bad guys dig up the capsule, it will be empty without the Algorithm.

Now in the final battle, the good guys use a temporal pincer movement. The red team travels normally forward through time in the ten minutes. The blue team waits until after the battle, then inverts so they are travelling backwards and does the battle in reverse during the same 10 minutes as the red team. When the blue team is done, they uninvert, so they are travelling normally through time, then tell the red team information before the red team begins their mission. In this way the red team has information of the coming battle before it even begins. This is the temporal pincer movement, the same way Sator won the car chase. The battle switches between perspectives of the red and blue teams, which is why you see both teams forwards and reverse between shots.

The good guys were fighting Sator's goons, in the same way that all the bad guys in spy movies have unquestioning, loyal goons. I think the last scene could've used way more shots of them. As for why they are helping Sator- I'm sure they get paid a lot and don't understand the potential consequences of their actions. 

At least that's what I think lol",im7etj
g4tm2jc,"Temporal Pincer Movement. One team going forwards in time and one back. The ending sequence actually happens at the same time as the Opera heist scene, so they traveled back in time to reach that moment. 

One team (blue team) goes in inverted 10 minutes after the bomb's set to blow. The other team (red team) reverts before the bomb is set to blow, and go in with the knowledge that blue team are able to give them, so that they have an edge in battle knowing what to expect.

They're fighting to prevent the bomb going off which seals the algorithm underground which (through a mechanism I'm uncertain of) will then lead to the reversal of the world's entropy.

I assume they're just fighting Sator's henchmen.",im7etj

I'm pretty sure bullet holes in regular time would always have had to been put there by someone in inverted time.

What this means is that subsequent times you watch the movie you know what will happen and it will be like watching an entirely different movie.  Much like The Prestige.

The future did not want to kill the past. I think we watched an episode in the lives of the detectives of Tenet, an organization that is founded in the future to safeguard the past from what could've been.   
So, while at the end we realize it's not what we thought, I think it ends up being quite similar to Predestination in some way.

g4e8x8f,"Sator (the bad guy) is trying to obtain the pieces of the time inversion device. The Protagonist is a CIA operative who joins some Ukranian special forces to retrieve it (the reasons for why he's with them are not known but presumably it's some CIA sting). 

The Ukranians pretend to take over the opera, thereby drawing a police/military response. To move through the opera without interference the Protagonist and his allies pretend to be part of the security response to the terror threat. While the police tries to deal with the 'terrorists', the Protagonist goes off and finds a VIP target to retrieve, as well as a 'package', which is a part of the time inversion device. However at this point the Protagonist notices his allies putting bombs near the unconscious civilians, which makes him no longer trust them. He swaps the 'VIP' person with another ally, a CIA guy, but gets caught by the real police and is about to be shot when an inverted bullet stops his attacker. We see a random masked guy leaving (we later find out this was Neil, Robert Pattinson's character). 

The Protagonist's ally says 'he's not one of ours'. The Protagonist then tosses the bombs above the audience so they don't die. He and his ally run back to the Ukranians special forces, but they realize he has swapped the VIP and decide to torture him and his ally at the train tracks later.",im7etj

g4rs2uj,"The only thing inverted are people and objects that go through the turnstiles and the vehicles they're in.  The rest of the world is still moving forward in the timeline, they're just moving backwards through it.",im7etj
g5szvay,"Tenet was created by the protagonist in the not-too-distant future. It probably started evolving into an actual organization shortly after the end of the movie (when he kills Priya and her assassin). He is moving forward for his entire life essentially, except for the few obvious moments when he is inverted during the course of the film. In this sense, he is basically preordained to do certain things without an understanding of what he will become. His knowledge of how to move forward relied on oracles like Michael Caine, the bullet scientist, the windmill guy, and Neil to steer him towards his fate. Things like the fake suicide pill were catalysts to convince him of his destiny. I'm not quite sure how he got to his status leading up to the opera attack but he clearly was already a badass and involved in Tenet; perhaps he was more of a rank-and-file CIA person up to that point. I'd like to see more discussion around that.

Objects are ""sent"" to the past via the turnstiles with people who are willing to travel in reverse in real time (there is no speedier method for this). Depending on when this future technology is discovered, this could mean that - for decades - there are operatives in oxygen trucks or some similar apparatus just waiting to get back to certain times to fulfill their missions (my guess is they used vehicles that would be inconspicuous in past times). We know that parts of the algorithm were first discovered around the fall of communism in Russia (1990). So let's say the events of the film take place in 2020 and the technology is sent back by the scientist in 2030. That means that people may have traveled for 40 years to hide the algorithm, or, for the antagonists, to find it. Sator's main henchman was probably part of this future group and was willing to sacrifice himself for their cause. Basically all the high level operatives are instructed to commit suicide at the end of their missions - the antagonists are essentially a death cult and it's also clear that Tenet uses suicide to hide information.

And finally Neil, assuming he is future Max, also probably inverted for a decade or more just to get back to the events of the film. Considering that, and the fact that he discovers his fate is to die in order to save the universe, this makes him one of the most understated heroes in cinematic history.",im7etj

gfaga3a,"Okay I just saw the movie the other day and am on my second watch.  I will say this- it's definitely a mess, yes.   90%+ of the movie is plot heavy, bland, and confusing. The remaining 10% is confusing and all but inaccessible to pretty much anybody.  


However, on second viewing, I've found that the movie is much easier to understand.  Not only that but you do discover many of Nolan's trademark hints, clues, foreshadowing, and other interesting details sprinkled in.  The ""action scenes"" as we'll call them, do become a bit more understandable once you have a handle on the overall plot of the movie and who was doing what and how.  So, if you're a solid Nolan fan, and aren't completely turned off by this film, I recommend at least another watch.  I don't like thinking of things in black and white terms, and while the movie was highly flawed, there were some intriguing aspects and there really is a semblance of a cohesive plot.  Yes there are plot holes but it's not as garbage as it ostensibly seems.  Part of the problem with swallowing it on the first version is that, much like Memento, we are only given bits of information at a time, and in an order that's not always helpful.

I would argue memento is slightly more complex than tenet. 

Tenet is a visual auditory spectacle. His movies are meant to be watched once in movie theater for the experience, and then another time to follow the actual story, and then finally to hopefully notice anything you missed in the previous viewings.

He purposely, as we already pointed out, does this to make the viewer pay attention. He knows most ppl are ADD af, so he does this to make you concentrate more on the dialogue and things that matter, like the fact that it’s a “movie” and technically dialogue doesn’t matter ....

g5rlqw5,"I've seen it twice now and I think I understand the premise-

The protagonist uses a time-loop in the future to revert back to the opera house under the knowledge that Sator's organization was going to stage the fake-terrorist attack (and fake rescue) in order to establish plausible deniability for stealing the algorithm from the cia agent. 

The Protagonist uses the scene in the future to establish himself within the tenet organization. This is why the russian thugs are revealed to be a farce-The tenet organization itself stole the algorithm (or at least this is implied) and the fake-cyanide pill was a mechanism for the protagonist to be iniatied into the organization in the first place. Sator's group hides as Swat agents with the scheme itself to establish fake legitimacy to the operation of stealing the valuable intelligence (the algorithm) from the cia agent. 

Essentially we learn at the end of the film that the entire movie was a time loop and the protagonist iniated the organization ""tenet"" years previously.

Thus the film both introduces the protagonist and the audience to the plot indirectly, and establishes a basis for the protagonist to pursue sator with basis later on in the film (knowledge of the opera house stunt)",im7etj

Either the car is inverted, which wouldn't work because it can't mix with un-inverted air, or it's not inverted, which doesn't explain why it reverse-crashed.  Just because the driver is inverted doesn't mean all objects around them move in reverse, at least that's my understanding.

As for driving, it would be fucked up.  You'd have to get into the car, stick in the key, un-turn it off (different from turning it on), at which point the car should hopefully be running or you fucked up in the future/past.  Then you'd have to put it in reverse for it to be forward for you, and the gas/brake would be causally reversed.  Because to make the car stop you hit the brakes, but to you you're going to be letting off the brakes then hitting the gas.  It's mind boggling.",im7etj

That being said, it does get better on the second viewing as you start to see a more cohesive picture and spot many trademark Nolan details/clues/etc.  It doesn't fix the inherent problems like dry, complicated plot, bland characters/character development, and a high concept gimmick that's rendered virtually inaccessible by the way it's portrayed.

gh9ufuz,"i half-agree with you, which seems about fitting for a flick like this. 

something was off with JDW from the start, maybe that was intentional. he seemed too chill/ laidback for a hero-agent 'protagonist' (which itself is/was one of the cornier dialogue points, and repeating it didnt help).

i wonder if his odd demeanor is a result/side effect of his near-death experience in the beginning. 

maybe the actor's tone conveyed an uneasiness which Nolan wanted, but was not f
well expressed enough for us to understand, at least not on first watch. i tend to give Nolan the benefit of doubt & here i think that the character's mix of confusion and confidence includes both ignorance and sense of mission/destiny. though still not sure if that was too much for them to convey in what little character building there was.

two telling comparisons: Neo in the matrix had a similar mix of confusion and confidence. Keanu Reeves did a better job of conveying that. and some of the characters from the short stories of Philip K Dick also are navigating in unreal realities, with an ordinariness and aplomb that seems illsuited until we dig deeper.

i'll be watching Tenet again soon.

TDKR was good, but didn’t reach the heights of the first two. Interstellar was disappointing to me because of how he overbloated what could have been a really special, simple story. Dunkirk was actually pretty great, but it being a war film without any specific characters makes it pretty forgettable. 

This one was bad enough for me to realize that, while I adore his run of BB, prestige, TDK, inception—arguably one of the best runs ever—my love of his movies is pretty contained to those four.

g3zrt2o,"I disagree with your point about the ambitiousness of the film. 

Inception is a film with multiple ""plots"" being told in one direction of time, just at different speeds. Tenet is a film with one plot that's told forward and then backward from a different perspective.

Where Inception has the luxury of its plots being in separate ""worlds"", Tenet has the challenge of layering a story on top of one that we've already seen. Because this is a time travel plot where ""what's happened has happened"", that means that there needs to be concrete evidence of this layering in both directions. 

Weaving that type of forwards-backwards story together with the added challenge of achieving dramatic tension is far more ambitious than telling multiple layers of separated story progressing at different speeds a la Inception. 

Memento is a bit more similar to Tenet in that it is a forwards-backwards story. The difference there is that Memento still has it's forwards and backwards plot separated by time if viewed chronologically. Tenet's forwards and backwards plots chronologically take place simultaneously, which I think is quite a bit more challenging. 

All that said, until a version is released with better audio levels, I think the quality of the film is about on par with Inception. Fingers crossed we get a version with improved audio like when they fixed Bane's voice in TDKR.",im7etj

Kat was inverted and pierced by a bullet going through reversed entropy relative to her, so that wound was atypical but still destructive. Particularly shitty for her actually.

If you inverted right after a nuclear weapon explodes (and hypothetically survive long enough to be inverted) and emerge from the turnstile, the processes of the nuclear explosion would be reversed (for you).

. The blood thing, from what i remember didnt she spray the deck with water to clean the sunscreen which was put there for lube before dragging him of the boat

. Yes they went through the turnstile again. They go backwards until they pass where they want to be and then they go forwards allowing her to coexist with her past self


We see another example of this at the airport where there are 3 protaganists one in the suit and 2 in the black spy outfit with the mask, so the one in the spy out fit has reversed through time to go through the turnstile and as one enters the other should exit leaving one spy outfit going forward and the suit wearing protaganist going forward co existing. And one spy outfit going backwards

. Kat will need the oxygen going backwards but not forwards, when she is injured on the way to the airport they are in the back of a truck (going backwards) sealed with oxygen pumped into the room, they bring her through the turnstile (going forwards) no more oxygen and she is in the past.

I know, I know: ""but Rise of Skywalker...""

Thing is, in this movie, all the key players related to those Macguffins add some depth to the story.

Priya is an arms dealer that points The Protagonist in the direction of Sator.  But he doesn't have a way into his circle.  So, his easiest way in is via Kat, who is an art appraiser.  

And both of those people still play into the plot.  It's not just The Protagonist squares up to Sator and cat-and-mouse for two hours.  

Priya is both a source of conflict and exposition.  Kat gives us a reason to think The Protagonist, who may not have a name, at least has the capacity to care about someone other than himself.  

I'm not a critic, so I'll appreciate if you don't bash me for my lack of attention to detail about the plutonium; I think it was related the Algorithm; specifically, how Sator was able to find them in the first place: someone who could deal in locating and moving plutonium is well-placed to find something that was otherwise meant to be un-findable.",im7etj

Part of the reason why more people aren’t willing to call the movie out on its bullshit is because of the 20 years of goodwill that Nolan has built up. 

Just imagine if the same movie was made by Josh Trank or Roland Emmerich or any other director who’s lost their critical credibility, it would get torched. It would struggle to rise above a 6 on IMDb. 

As it stands, Tenet feels like Nolan’s Netflix release. Unlimited budget with no oversight and creative pushback from a studio, with the director’s tics and obsessions taken to its extremes, all resulting in a bloated overlong film that doesn’t satisfy anyone except the hardcore faithful.",im7etj
g4ebghi,"Yup. I just keeping thinking that man. This feels like a total parody of a Christopher Nolan movie. And I've gotten that vibe since the trailer from December. Something that was cool to me about Nolan for a while was how each of his movies, despite having the same sense of tone, they do feel quite different from each other. Inception isn't Interstellar isn't Dunkirk isn't his Batman movies. So I was already rather disappointed to see him go back to the well of ""trippy action movie"".

And now, here we are. As for what the hell happened, I think the problem was more fundemental than a change in editor. I just think Nolan happened to choose a high concept that was so hard to work with, he decided to forgo all the other things that makes a movie, a movie. Everything that makes storytelling in the movies what it is, is dropped in favor of ""woah, man."" Either willingly, or again, because you almost have to, if you want that concept to work in the movie.

I guess this is what happened to George Lucas and the prequels, as has been discussed to death, basically. Get called a genius too many times, and you start to believe you're invincible. No one tells you no anymore, and that's dangerous, as can be seen with this movie.

I'll end with just noting how much easier a pitch Inception is over this one. "" Invade someones mind to plant or take information"". Versus, um, ""A group of agents try to stop a madman from using time travel technology, where like, um. You enter a little room, and come out of it going backwards in time, while you yourself move forward? Um?"" Just, total lack of a focused concept, unfortunately.

g3zj812,"The reason it's difficult to understand is because it's so dependent on what perspective you're viewing things from. Assuming we're not going back with the bullet, here's what it would mean.  After you've placed the bullet in the timestile and it's traveling backwards in time, it's not undoing the original events of itself.  Instead, it would mean there was a parallel bullet that existed before it was built in 2019, and is getting newer and newer as time goes on.  In fact, at the point in which we are putting he bullet in the timestile, we'd also be seeing the parallel bullet get put into the timestile on the other side of the window (or technically we would be seeing someone take it out of the timestile in reverse).

Or to put it all more succinctly, objects with reverse entropy are not replacing or undoing the original objects. They exist in parallel and eventually their ""histories"" join at the point that they both enter the timestile.",im7etj

Near the beginning we are told the gravity of the situation, that the fate of the world is in the balance. Yet despite that, the Protagonist repeatedly risks mission success to help one lady and her child? Talk about a conflict in interests. I was expecting a twist where is Kat is revealed as more important to the plot, or alternatively a self sacrifice, especially after they let her in on the stakes.

Could they have revealed the ultimate goal (stop the past world from ruining the future world) earlier? If you miss Sator saying those few sentences (and he says them through a freaking speaker phone) then you miss all of that. I wonder if they could have revealed that earlier somehow. It isn't a game changer necessarily when it happens because knowing it or not doesn't change the plot or what is going to happen (they are still trying to destroy the past)",im7etj

His dead man's switch would transmit the location of the buried algorithm to the future so they can dig it up and activate it, which destroys the past.

2. The protagonist goes to see Kat, he uses Thomas Arep~~p~~o's name like he knows him. Kat is suspicious that something is up.

The problem is that for the first half of the movie you effectively keep being shown shit that will not matter nor be explained for another hour or more. Indeed, the amount of scenes involving time manipulation in the first half is EXTREMELY small because if a sequence involves time manipulation, then they are forced to repeat it during the second half, and they clearly didn't wanna do that for stuff like the bungee jump.

But the result is that you're left watching just... normal espionage BS for the majority of the runtime. And again it's not till the middle of the movie that you're finally introduced to the full concept, or how it'll come into play. You're not even told why the villain IS the villain until 2/3s thru the movie.

The end result is not just bad pacing, it's bad writing all around. It's effectively saying ""yes I know the first hour and a half of this movie is not engaging but trust me once you see it played in reverse it's gonna be REALLY cool"".

It would've been way more impressive if the first act had been amazing... and THEN was reversed, but it's not. All the cool shit only happens in the second half, and by then it feels dumb rather than intriguing.",im7etj

Alice removes her hand, and moonwalks out of the room with her hand intact. 

From Alice’s inverted perspective, she walks into a room. Bob is freeze-drying cooked spaghetti in a pot. Hot steam is condensing into a pot of rapidly-cooling water. Alice sticks her hand into the pot of condensing water, and her hand freezes because the phase change is consuming ambient heat energy. Alice walks out of the room with a frozen hand.

The very fact that the future existed was proof enough that they could not succeed in their plan.

I actually liked this part of the plot a lot.  You're left wondering what will happen if they succeed and if they can succeed.  But at the end of the movie you realize they never could.

They were trying to drop the algorithm down the hole and then blow up the cave structure above it, in order to entomb it thoroughly enough that it wouldn't be disturbed. When Kenneth Branagh died, the dead man's switch sent out a message to be picked up by the future people so that they knew where to find the algorithm, so they could activate it.",im7etj

This was confusing?  

I mean, I might give you that the last action scene was a trifle hard to follow everything, but the movie pretty much told you how a temporal pincer movement worked just after The Protagonist entered the turnstile.  After that it was more or less the understanding that you were going to have a series of things that practically screamed at you that either The Protagonist or Neil was going to be doing something important that would be explained pretty shortly.

2. Yes the sound mixing in this film was not that good and there was a lot of dialogue that was hard to hear. Will agree on this point.

3. Yes 7.8 because they actually know what they’re talking about it.

4. You need to watch the movie multiple times and actually know how to dissect a film and it’s dialogue. The characters have much more meaning and emotion to them after multiple viewings and understanding all the subtleties in the movie. Watch a damn YouTube video if you’re still too stupid to understand any of the characters. Especially Neil.

5. This proves that you weren’t even paying attention and have such a slow train of thought that you don’t even have the right to leave a review on the movie. Kat authenticated a painting that was actually a forgery (a fake) but she didn’t know that. Sator, her husband, bought the painting knowing that it was a fake and used that knowledge to black mail her and force her to stay with him (or else she can go to jail for fraud because of the painting). Now he has a hold on her and their son and controls them. PT (protagonist), who’s job it was to try and get in contact with Sator, knew the only way of doing so was through Kat. So he sets up a dinner with her to try and convince her to setup a meeting for him with Sator. She only agrees on a quid pro quo. He helps steal the painting back from the Freeport, which means Sator no longer can blackmail her, and only then will she setup a meeting with her husband. Hence the whole Freeport sequence happens. PT and Neil also wanted to use the opportunity to see if there was any other inverted contraband in Sators vault, which is when the fight happens. and yes they don’t “accomplish” anything BECAUSE the fight happens. They only have such a small amount of time before the workers come back into the vaults and because of the unexpected fight, they have to retreat from the mission.",im7etj

So that was the Sator from the future. Remember after the car chase, Sator was inverted and got away with the Algorithm. Then the Tenet guys were like ""shit, where/when did he go?"" and Kat, JDW and RPat figured out that he would chose to go back to the day he felt most loved in Vietnam and die there. So the Sator she shot was the Sator who had travelled into the past, un-inverted and got onto the boat to relive his happiest memory with the intention of killing himself.

The Sator who was in the present at that moment on the boat had flown off somewhere. That Sator will live out the events of the movie, before inverting back and dying on the boat. It's all the same Sator basically",im7etj

A better film would shift that over so that the gimmick is more fleshed out, portrayed in a more accessible and entertaining way, and the plot wasn't so difficult to penetrate.

People are conflating complex with complicated.

I don't think it's odd. I think it's just another example of the time loop. Neil helps JDW and even saves his life in the past. Therefore JDW HAS to recruit him to put things into motion in the future so they can loop back.

Him wanting to help this woman escape her abusive marriage is very noble of him, but doesn't really carry any greater emotional significance.

&#x200B;

 If he knew that in doing so he was also saving the life of a man who will eventually sacrifice himself for him, that makes it much more significant. There's many points in the film where ultimately the woman and her son are expendable, he's willing to let her get shot. Knowing that their fates are tied in with his own would have given greater meaning to his struggle to save them.

&#x200B;

I.e. Why not just put that in the film? It would have made the film better. Why make it a puzzle for the audience to figure out and something that the protagonist isn't even aware of during the film.

&#x200B;

Presumably then he's going to potter about doing stuff for a few years and then one day realise, hey wait a second this young boy looks a bit familiar. You could even put an epilogue in the film from 10 years later or something where you see the penny drop. But then he'd be recruiting/grooming a boy to fight against his own evil father and that doesn't seem like a very nice thing to do.

g3yrwib,"Not to destroy anything for you, but I wouldn't say, that The Protagonist is from the future, bit rather that he will found Tenet in the future and is going to recruit Neil who he then sends back in time to help himself against Sator.
Also the word Tenet is more probably taken from the ""Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas"" Poem. Actually all the words in it were used in the Film. Andrei Sator (the villain), Thomas Arepo (the counterfeiter who forged to Goya paintings, Tenet (obviously), the Kiev Opera (in the opening scene) and Rotas (Sator's company that owns the freeport).",im7etj

g4k9ooh,"The basic premise is that entropy is reversed for those who are ""inverted"". Entropy is the measure of order in a system. There's a law in physics that the total entropy of the universe always increases with time meaning that things in the universe get more disordered as time goes on.

That scene where the explosion turns to ice is total science fiction but it's there to illustrate the point that entropy is being reversed. The hot, chaotic explosion (high entropy) freezes (low entropy) when reversed.

It's a science fiction movie so there's inherently a suspense of disbelief if you accept the initial premise.",im7etj
g4lzdoq,"Think of a saucepan on a flame, being heated up. Now imagine time running backwards: heat is apparently being drained from the saucepan, down into the fire. If that inverse saucepan 'starts off' hot, the fire cools it down to room temperature, but if it starts at room temperature, it freezes. In forwards-time, someone has put a frozen pan on the fire and defrosted it.

Heat transfer is reversed. So from the Protagonist's POV, the explosion sucked all the heat out of him.",im7etj

g41n1mp,Didn't the protagonist make tenet in the future? So wouldn't it mean Neil had to live inverted for years to get to the start of thus film.,im7etj
g414nmp,Yes. They were just moving backwards through time due to having their entropy “inverted”. Whatever that means.,im7etj
g4199md,"Yeah, that's what I assumed. I thought it was a super interesting take on the concept. It is really interesting to think about the logistics behind this I think. It certainly is a big hurdle but there is literally no other way to solve this for the characters.",im7etj
g426p96,"The Vietnam vacation was only a couple weeks in the past, I think, but yes.

Though, The Protagonist didn't live inverted, because he creates Tenet in the future. To him, it hasn't happened yet. Neil is the one who lived inverted to travel back; that's why it's the end of their friendship for him, but the beginning for the Protagonist.

(though I'm thinking now that Neil can't have been inverted because he didn't require air for the whole film, so I guess...in the future, The Protagonist recruits Neil, and then future Neil...recruits the past Neil? tells him what to do? gosh this movie idk)",im7etj
g471zh0,What makes it feel long are there are numerous scenes that are just dialogue and you can't understand a word of what is being said.  So you're sitting there watching essentially nothing for 3-5 minutes and those scenes feel like an eternity to get through.,im7etj

g47nsp4,"Depends on whose perspective we're following in the film.  When we are following a non inverted character, inverted characters and the objects they use appear to move backward and vice versa.  When we're following an inverted character, the non-inverted environment and vehicles appear backwards.",im7etj
g46q78f,"It depends on the vehicle. If the person is driving it forward while 'inverted', it should naturally look like it is being driven backwards in forward time, no? It is because the actor (driver) is the catalyst by which the vehicle moves. If they drive a vehicle backwards while inverted, it would appear to be going forwards in 'regular' time. Hope that helps",im7etj
g48ozn6,"So what I understood is that the future people are ages in the future, centuries possibly. Priya says something like ""many generations"". Because when you invert, you have to live every moment in reverse, they would die of old age before they reached the time of the movie",im7etj

g48ou86,"So that was the Sator from the future. Remember after the car chase, Sator was inverted and got away with the Algorithm. Then the Tenet guys were like ""shit, where/when did he go?"" and Kat, JDW and RPat figured out that he would chose to go back to the day he felt most loved in Vietnam and die there. So the Sator she shot was the Sator who had travelled into the past, un-inverted and got onto the boat to relive his happiest memory with the intention of killing himself.

The Sator who was in the present at that moment on the boat had flown off somewhere. That Sator will live out the events of the movie, before inverting back and dying on the boat. It's all the same Sator basically",im7etj
g4avxd1,Unnamed but basically we fuck the world up and they/he/she just wants it to end and not have the misery they live with now. The scientist who created the world killer spread the pieces out in the past and killed herself so they couldn't get it.,im7etj

Just like how some basketball players are born to be talented, or some businessmen are born with natural charisma. Some Tenet Agents are born with the skill to not die or become evaporated due to coming in contact with themself. 

For example, from the very beginning everything in the movie has already happened. 

We are watching the movie backwards. 

So if we are watching the movie backwards, then The Protagonist should've died at the very first moment that we are seeing them fight.",im7etj

- visually it's impossible to understand the assault because there was nothing to cling to for clarity except Neil, Protagonist + Ives, Female team leader: the enemies and their plan are convoluted.

I felt the first scene was incredible, and the best spectacle of the whole film, but for me didn’t do a good enough job to set the tone for the rest of the movie, or give me enough to care about our main character at all. It’s cool that he would sacrifice himself for his country/ the job, but that wasn’t enough of a “call to action” for me as viewer. Visuals were incredible, can’t wait for BTS some day, and Nolan is an INCREDIBLE filmmaker. I don’t even think the story was all that confusing or hard to follow...I just didn’t feel too compelled by the whole “world is gonna end” when I don’t really care about about any of the characters. That’s why a film like infinity war pulled that off so well. We cared more about the characters and that allowed us to think “holy shit, what if our loved ones all were dusted.” 

This was just “oh no plutonium” (they said it like 1000 times) and “oh no, the algorithm!!!” Which got so redundant and cheesy to me",im7etj

g4uiuik,"I saw the early screening on Aug 31. So my memory of it isn't as quite as fresh as it was when I first posted. I actually have a close family member who also watched Tenet and really liked it. Your comment kind of reminds me of what he was telling me. He is a huge Nolan fan.

And while I wanted to keep my expectations low, I did have some small amount of hope that this would be the next great Nolan film like Inception, The Prestige or The Dark Knight. And it wasn't close to that imo. I think that probably was at least partially why my review had a somewhat negative tone.

Overall I felt like I understood the film and it made sense. It was just not as enjoyable in my eyes as I felt it could have been. I felt they had an incredibly interesting concept that was somewhat wasted on a bland plot. They did a great job revealing things early on in an intriguing manner but as the actual story was unveiled I just felt disappointed with it.

I didn't mind that there wasn't romance. (As a bitter single guy, I usually don't like most romantic subplots in film but I digress) I'm just not sold on the level of devotion/attachment Washington's character had for Debecki's character. Washington's character didn't seem to be that kind of character prior to meeting her. I understand your explanation and how it worked out practically at the end but I think giving some kind of additional reason for him to care about her would have benefitted that dynamic. It could have been romance(the easiest route most films take), maybe having been friends with her in the past or perhaps some other reason, like maybe she reminds him of his own mother or something. It doesn't have to be romance but I felt more was needed.

One thing I do like about the film is that they cast a black actor in a lead role that wasn't about him being black. Any good actor of any race could have taken on that same role. I'd like to see more of that in major films. Human roles that aren't obsessed with race or racial stereotypes.

Unlike many others I actually didn't have many problems with the sound. There was some unclear dialogue in the early scenes and that one Indian(iirc) lady had a heavy accent iirc but that's really it. Maybe it was because I was in an Imax theatre idk.

In terms of bad dialogue, I've mostly forgotten but one that stands out is the infamous ""including my son"" statement from Debecki's character in response to a statement about world destruction. That was very clunky imo, comically bad.

I don't think it was a bad movie overall and I'm glad you enjoyed it as much as you did. I just felt like it didn't quite reach it's potential.",im7etj

The theory is very credible. I think it's likely, even. I don't really know if that would fix the emotion though, because emotion is subjective and I haven't rewatched the film yet. I would wager it's still emotionally vacuous.

>What made it a solid 5 was the Opera scene and the fight scenes as well as when Protagonist first goes inverted. Those all felt like Nolan films.

The initial moment before he Inverts himself and exits the airlock, *felt* like a Nolan-film in a way few other scenes did. It felt like that was ""when shit was going to get real"", so to speak. But it never did and petered out instead.

I wouldn't say the film is a 5/10, because Nolan's action and score are usually so significantly better (particularly because of the lack of visual effects) than the competition. However, the finale's action was bizarely faceless and that significantly hurt it. I question if this was due to a lack of coverage or horrible editing.

Regardless, I'd personally say the film is a 6/10 or barely a 7/10.",im7etj

So those bullets were fired into the material and then the entire piece of rubble was put through the inverter. 

Also, the nature of objects to be movable backwards in time is explained in a few lines between The Protagonist and the scientist (Fleur Delacour) as ""instinct"". That's definitely the most magical part of the movie in a movie that's already very fantastical.

Who built a building that has inverted soldiers trapped in the wall, waiting for an explosion to release them? ...or if it was going the other way... Who built a building with a crater in the side waiting for normal soldiers to get trapped in it by an explosion?

Also, The Protagonist (inverted) has the airport fight and goes through the turn-style at the airport. Some (inverted) time later Neil goes through with Kat on the hospital bed. The protagonist (going forward) is then waiting outside and Neil appears with Kat.

The problem is that Neil spent longer going backwards. He should be there first.

I don't think they needed to explicitly state this as we can infer from the visuals. They chose a rule which looks cool, sure, but it's consistent. 

I'd have to disagree with you and say that the movie goes to great lengths to treat a sci-fi concept meticulously and without error, which Nolan tends to do. 

What I didn't really get is the heat transfer being reversed. Heat is the fast movement of particles. Why would this movement being reversed turn it into cold?

I like the movies, but the Nolan brothers definitely deserve all the rolling eyes they can get. They are downright allergic to wit (which enhances almost all thoroughly dramatic movies or shows), the dialogue is hammy, forgettable... many characters lack a real identity on top.

Dark Knight is the biggest outlier in my eyes, and even then we're still dealing with excessive broodiness and what-have-you. I don't need it to be Knives Out, but man it wouldn't hurt to take some inspiration. I think Schindler's List has better and more jokes going for it than the entirety of the Nolans' catalog.

But seriously, Tenet was way out there as far as bad dialog is concerned. The half you could hear was just really mediocre dialogue with great Göransson music. In fact, that's easily what I liked most about it. The gimmick/""reveal"" was a dud for me, the music at least felt right.",im7etj

One could reorient this scene as a dialogue on how men can sometimes be too logical, not consider outside-the-box or creative thinking, only look at facts and data. Dr. Brand, however, seems to realize that there is more going on than just science (she seems the most interested in who the wormhole-placers are and why) and is extrapolating based on the physical pull she feels towards Edwards’ planet. 

I thought that for an emotionally-based argument, Dr. Brand does very well to phrase it in universal terms. I like that scene a lot because it points out how little we actually know about the universe and how things work. At least, that’s my take on it.",im7etj

The bad future people tried to use bad Russian man to reassemble the algorithm and communicate where he hid it so that they could use it in the future to destroy the past (!!???!!?).

Honestly, it's about cluing the audience in. You got someone who gets beat up and spits blood while mumbling the answer? Have the torturer ask again and have him repeat the name. Dozens of easy ways to make it sound natural - not that Nolan should start with the tropes because man, he still goes for pretentious, dumb, unwitty dialogue (and I'm saying that as one of his bigger fans) - just grab any; these are the good stylistic devices you just don't want to scrap.

Confusing your audience without a chance at looping them back into what is happening is the least cinematic thing you can do. You want them to hear every syllable and smack.

gevnq6m,"Really agree man. It seemed like this film could have really been okay to possibly good in my book with editing being more cohesive. Even with the character disconnection. 

It seemed kinda weird that though this whole movie we knew more about the villain than any of our protagonists. Wish they disconnected from all characters or gave a little bit more backstory about all characters. 

Upon reading your comment, I agree. I love Washington in other roles I’ve seen him in, I’m pretty sure the script was just awkward and the whole vibe of the movie trying to make him as seemingly charming at times without having the script to match that energy was the worst. 

Maybe this is just me so let me know if I’m wrong... but I’m quite confused at how he even got started on this journey or mission regarding Sator. All I really recall is the guy in the beginning tells him tenet may open doors and all of a sudden he’s off and running. I may just be missing something there. 

I thought the whole thing with the painting was also weird. So sator is blackmailing his wife about the painting? It just didn’t seem interesting or compelling but perhaps I missed this too.

The lack of believability and storytelling in this movie just made it a mess.

g44up6f,"We know that Neil had to have spent some time getting back in time to meet the Protagonist for the ""first time"", because it seems that he was recruited by The Protagonist in the future.

So while The Protagonist said he'd stay away from Kat, we've seen before that he's OK with bending the rules (he's told not to touch his inverted self, and then proceeds to not just touch him, but *kicks his own ass*...).

So, it's plausible that The Protagonist recruits Kat's son Max to the cause later in Max's life, changing his name to Neil so that the past Protagonist wouldn't cotton on that it's the same person. Kat, understanding what's at stake, would probably not have much choice but to allow it. Neil/Max would then go inverted and travel back to his ""first"" meeting with The Protagonist.

The implication of this is that if Max is about 8-9 years old at the end of the film when Kat is picking him up from school, and Neil is about mid-thirties when he meets The Protagonist, then he must have inverted when he was in his early twenties, and lived out most of his twenties going backwards in him, hiding from his forward-moving self.

It's possible that this explains why Neil seems happy to help The Protagonist keep Kat alive despite it apparently not being important to the overall mission.

Not that they died, or that the process repeats itself. The process in and of itself is impossible. It is not a loop, because it can not exist in our current understanding of time. Only the conversation about the events can, similar to ""What came first, the chicken or the egg?"". That borderlines Bootsrap more than anything. 

What some have surmised is that the timelines split, causing a parallel universe to exist with the individual in it, that does not alter their own personal timeline (the one they are standing in) but would alter the outcome of the one they came from. Ultimately that door is shut and the individual could never return (fixed points in time) but could exist in the new parallel universe as who they are at that fixed point they created. 

Personally, I am not a fan of multiverse or parallel verse theories since it, to me, is just a ""well then, what if...."" to excuse indiscriminate refusal of accepting responsibility for our actions and still lets us believe ""we can just fix it if we go back"".  

To quote the movie, ""What has happened, happened""   or others like ""What happened happened and couldn't have happened any other way"".

That's just me though, and I am no physicist. I just can't stand movies and writings that ignore or excuse these actions. All opinion. Personally, I think Nolan did the best he could to create a movie that avoided these issues. It just doesn't always make for the best ""movie go'er story time"" feeling but was nice to see someone at least put effort into it.

gdv5fn3,"I thought the writing was brilliant for what it was trying to do and the way it was shot was a master class in film making unlike anything I've ever seen.

That being said, the entire movie is about the inverse of everything, or the ying yang for a lack of a better phrase.

The protagonist from the beginning past perspective is the one half, the half that does whatever it takes to do the right thing even if it means trying not to kill anyone. The end future protagonist is the other half that does whatever it takes to do the right thing even if it means having to kill.

He does this because what's happened has happened. He has to ensure she survives so that in the future everything plays out in the past as it is supposed to since he's the one that goes on to create the Tenet he knows this.

It's by no means a perfect movie but I think it managed to fully accomplish what it was trying to do which is more about a cerebral exploration of a simultaneous forward / rewind in a film under the guise of past / future. I've only seen it once but I couldn't identify an apparent plot hole between the two sides being displayed.

About half way through the movie when Pattinson said ""he took care of the other guy"" in the suit off screen it all clicked for me on who it was and I was really able to start focusing on how the parallels between past and future encompassed literally everything about the movie on multiple levels. Even the above mentioned narrative is the actual overall past vs future arc. It's the story of how this dude goes on to create the Tenet to save the world as the protagonist. The entire movie is basically just one big intricate plan by the ""future"" protagonist.

You're right though you've seen this before because at the very least Nolan did this sorta narrative with Interstellar and Inception so it's not exactly a new idea from him it's just that it's an entire movie about it. That's why I ultimately think it was just an excuse to show off his technical film making ability with the forward / rewinding of footage stuff.",im7etj

This just felt pointless, I've now done some reading into the plot and I still don't care. 

By all means, make a movie that challenges the audience but if making a movie for the mainstream with the intention that ""only some will understand"" is 1. Wasting most people's money and 2. Portrays a director who is more interested making movies for himself than for anybody else.

I don't really understand why they had to travel so far into the past to hide the pieces of the algorithm either (except for Sator to find it and start this whole process over again?). It's all these intricate details I keep getting hung up on that blow my mind.

But yeah, if Max/Neil inverted for a decade, that explains why he's still a relatively young and tragic hero (he must have been recruited early). My initial interpretation was that Protagonist inverted back to the past with his knowledge at the end of the film, founded Tenet, hired and trained Neil (not Max) and that's how they got to know each other in that timeline. Then Neil went on his suicide mission to go back and recruit the younger version of the Protagonist and kick off the events of the film, etc. I think both versions would play out in a similar way.",im7etj

What I like about this movie, and I liked a lot about Inception, too, is that it took a concept, explained the concept, and then was all like, ""Okay, students, time for an advanced application on the topic"".

Admittedly, the puzzle-box nature of Nolan's films does invite scrutiny, so I can't be too disparaging of those who want to really deeply deconstruct the mechanics of them.

Tenet is more of an allegory for the Feynman wheeler hypothesis, that anti matter is just matter going back in time . And people emerging from the turnstile and disappearing into it are basically physical representations of matter anti matter collisions. 
Also the fire freezing the protagonist was just a very pointed,contrived way to double down and emphasize on that reversed entropy concept even though it doesn't make much sense.

While the dream sequences are vital to the whole plot of Inception, in Tenet inverting just seems to be relevant for a few action scenes, and the rest of the time its just explained away in a sort of hand-wavey fashion. I feel you could make the same movie without invertion and it would more or less make sense",im7etj
g449opm,"not sure if this is correct but here's what I think:

the people from the distant future were attempting to revert climate change. presumably the machine would have inverted the world. although the Tenet people believed that using the machine to invert the world would probably just destroy the world, rather than save it.",im7etj

g5wty9d,"You are definitely in the minority on that one. Things you find stupid, many others will find exciting or they've suspended their belief enough. Dunkirk is completely void of characters or emotion, which are the building blocks for my personal enjoyment in any film. No matter the amount of well-shot action, accuracy of the time, or practical effects matters to me if those two things aren't there. That's something Dunkirk and Tenet have in common. Interstellar tried to force character and emotion and failed big time -- other than the scene of them watching videos after the time lapse, but that worked conceptually as an idea and because of the acting in that scene. All of his movies prior to that balanced everything fairly neatly. Sure TDKR is a big dumb overwrought film with huge leaps in logic, but it's fun nonetheless. Pure fun with the right amount of character/stakes works every time.",im7etj

g4vf9wt,"1 second before the future people activate the algorithm: The world is made of regular matter. Air, water, people, all travelling forwards through time. A few objects and people going backwards if they've been through a turnstile, but presumably a negligible amount compared to everything else.

1 second after they invert the world: Everything is now going backwards. But 2 seconds ago the world wasn't filled with inverted matter, and it's literally the same second. Where was all this extra stuff before? Where is the uninverted matter now?

Everything in the film always happened the way it happened - around the time of the opening siege, there are two Kats in Vietnam and another Protagonist and Neil(s) in Stalsk-12 - because those events are compatible. But the world can't simultaneously be made entirely of inverted and uninverted matter, and we can see that it isn't in the present, so that inverted future is incompatible with this world.

So what happens? Do they branch off into a brand-new inverted parallel universe, contrary to the fixed, deterministic block-universe model established in the film? Does the universe just say ""Nope"" and blink out of existence the instant they hit the switch? Or do they 'record over' our reality, erasing the past that created them, so their own births never occurred, so they couldn't have inverted the world, so their births did happen, so they did invert the world, so they were never born, etc, etc, creating a time paradox, the result of which could cause a chain reaction that would unravel the very fabric of the space-time continuum and destroy the entire universe? Granted, that's worst-case scenario. The destruction might in fact be very localized, limited to merely our own galaxy.

Basically, the future antagonists are desperate enough to gamble that they'll survive, but they're probably wrong, and it's probably best not to find out either way.",im7etj

Past events already transpired and can't be changed.  The concept of time was dealt with pretty well compared to other movies.  Like when inversed Protagonist and Neil are going back to the Freeport and the knife wound shows up on his arm and starts to get worse as he goes backward closer to and up to the point where his regular self stabs his inversed self.  He knows he's going to get stabbed and even though he tries to prevent it from happening and knows exactly how it will happen he is powerless to prevent it.  The future is powerless to change the past in every sense.,im7etj

Like why was the bullet jumping back into the gun? It might make sense if the protagonist was moving backwards at that time and we viewed it forwards, but he is moving forwards. Him firing the empty gun should not have triggered the bullet to jump back. It didnt seem that thats not things were working in any of the other backwards scenes

g4j92w9,Oh man... that's good,im7etj
g7r1j58,Nolan has some really cool ideas for plot-twisting scripts that create great visuals. He just needs a writing partner to clean up the exposition parts with good dialogue and clear explanations.,im7etj
g5swxb0,"I actually very much hated the fact that it's so long; having sat in a theatre for 3 hours, I end up resenting films/directors for this. 

Granted, I didn't altogether dislike it. I have a hard time staying engaged in long movies - my brain stops working and I stop caring about the plot because I'm just begging for it to be over.  It gets boring.

But I agree with OP that this is on me - for people who don't have my problem and can stay interested/engaged, a complex plot, that isn't a deal breaker.

I loved the ""progressiveness"" by fact that the lead protagonist  was a black man, portrayed as a super-intelligent physicist (rather than a slave or just some supporting role who gets killed off) and the idea that the future ""us"" felt the effects of climate change so badly that they felt the need to risk the grandfather paradox and kill us all. I thought it was clever to raise the question ""...ARE we the good guys?"" 

Because you know since the good guys saved the world, the point is they're just gonna destroy it again. 

Otherwise I was very turned off by the length, and that the pacing had to be so fast that I could barely hear what everyone was saying in the first half of the movie to make up for it. I have a hard enough time already ""hearing"" characters dialogues in movies, from mumbling to quietness to irrelevant banter.  I felt like I was watching 3 movies in one trying to connect the opening scene with ending scenes and everything in between. I blame the complexity which was not feasibly understandable in one pass of the film.",im7etj

g478uhr,"Same thing happened with inception, and it didn’t turn out too bad",im7etj
g46tam2,I think the reaction is just the initial reactions. Whoever does manage to get multiple viewings to truly understand the complexities of the movie will be rewarded with such a rich and complex story and the joy of unpacking it is just something else. So I believe it will age like fine wine and will in due time be considered one of Nolan's best.,im7etj
g3yoo63,"In fairness to John David Washington it was a physical role he was playing, not a major dramatic piece. He performed backwards choreographed fight scenes completely new even to the stunt team, practically no cgi which means he had to do 99% of his stunts, especially when the hand held cams are up close to him, and going through these tough physical exertions everyday for months. I doubt many actors would be in such a place physically to be able to perform the role. However I do agree the dramatic side was dull but that was more due to Nolan focusing his writing on complex physics concerning time, brushing over character development and meaning, but Nolan also let us know this, hence the name The Protagonist.",im7etj

g470icf,"I think after the lackluster story of Dunkirk and Tenet that WB won't just be handing Nolan another $250 million dollar check and telling him to go nuts.  There will almost certainly be studio oversight on his next project.  Usually studio ""meddling"" is bad for a creative genius but in this case Nolan needs to be reeled in and brought back to reality.  I can't imagine WB heads saw the final cut of this movie and were thrilled.",im7etj
g4b3vn3,"The painting subplot was **way more** complicated than it had to be. Nolan just needed to find a way for Sator to have leverage over Kat. Why he had to create a never seen on screen love interest art forger who ultimately gets crippled by Sator to do so, was a lot.

Why not just have Sator go like ""I did this illegal thing and it is in your name so if you do anything wrong I'll turn you in and you can't see your son anymore""",im7etj
g485tfk,"My thinking on that was something that frequently happens in spy movies.

gfahire,I think some characters did a decent job.  Kenneth Branaugh was a standout and did a great job.  I actually thought Pattinson did a decent enough job.  The writing just wasn't there to make for interesting characters though.  Much of the film I can't envision a way the characters could have acted better with what they had; maybe I'm wrong.  It's the problem the Star Wars prequels had- terrible writing and bad direction lead to poor performances from many actors who otherwise do well.,im7etj

g3zgmmq,"> He said that because in the future JDW recruits Neil into Tenet. Thus they have several years of history working together. It doesn't necessarily mean Neil is the kid.

When Neil said ""This is just the beginning of our relationship, you will get to know me a bit more"". This is referring to JDW's relationship with the kid after growing fond of Kat which is the final ending scene. Yup you're right, future JDW recruits Neil into Tenet, which is Kat's son to save JDW and his mother. 

> Neil helps JDW and even saves his life in the past.

When they first meet, that was already future Neil. He knew he doesn't drink on the job and that he likes drinking diet coke.
>I think Neil would have had a more visceral reaction to Kat's injury if he really were her son.

Neil is visibly upset about Kat being shot and potentially dying. He went to great lengths of saving her more than someone who would have normally reacted to that situation.",im7etj

The fact that it works both ways(albeit a fairly unusual sounding and dis-jarring) but that it works is relatively incredible.

g47jfqi,"Nolan films make a lot of money from repeat viewers and word of mouth.

That's not gonna happen with Tenet.

Satyr's plan was to bury the completed algorithm under this base and leave it undisturbed until the future people he worked for could get to it.

g3ynqg7,Before setting the protagonist on fire.,im7etj
g4m598x,"He says he's known the Protagonist a long time, though, so someone has to have gone back that far. Three possibilities I can think of:

* The Protagonist inverts at some point in the future and goes back far enough to have a long friendship with Neil before the events of the film. But he'd only need to go back far enough to set up Tenet, and he *can* only go back as far as the construction of the first turnstile.  
* Neil is from the future, has a long friendship with the Protagonist, then goes back to enact his instructions. But I don't think he's old enough to have done this unless he was very young when they met.  
* Young Neil and the Protagonist meet in the future and have their long friendship before, during and after inverting to set up Tenet. This way actually requires the least time spent inverted, since it runs concurrently with the friendship, instead of doubling back over it.

Third way seems most likely, most interesting and least lonely to me. Doesn't mean he's Max, but if you're going to have the Protagonist befriend and recruit a young man in the near future, it might as well be the one who's already involved.",im7etj

I mean, as an example of how ludicrous this ends up looking, lemme ask you this: what exactly does the Joker do to Gambol in The Dark Knight? In the shot right before he's ""killed"", the Joker has what looks like a damn paring knife in Gambol's cheek.

If you look at the quote superficially then it seems clunky but from her perspective he's the only thing she cares about and it didnt take away from the scene for me.

You are right, it's a shit joke

The Protaganist doesnt really have much personality tbh, but lots of hero characters dont have personality. Harry Potter, Frodo Baggins. Sometimes but not always the burden of the hero is enough and others have to be the relief.

I dont expect to change your mind after the fact btw if you didnt enjoy there is no way i can change that after you've finished watching it, it's just how i made sense of it at the time.

I whole heartedley agree about having a person of colour starring in a role and the film not mention it once. Everybody is human and there is no chance of an us and them mindset except for good and bad guys. Black Panther did this well although i wasnt the biggest fan of it (unpopular opinion especially since Chadwick Boseman died who WAS brilliant as Black Panther) somewhat like you with Tenet i felt it was good but wasnt THAT great but it was the characters that were important and it was a well told story involving almost exclusively people of colour.",im7etj

It's just good VFX, very well supervised and used when it made sense to be used. Some shots actually could've used some CGI enhancements that they didn't get, specially in the 3rd act's fight. Exploding fake buildings usually makes them look too light, and CGI could've helped there.

Anyways, sorry for the rant but as a VFX artist I feel pretty terrible about this new marketing scheme taking advantage of the audience's perception of bad CGI, instead of being proud of using it properly.

What do you mean by that? The body doesn't actually heal when going backwards. When you're travelling backwards, your entropy is still increasing in the same direction you are going. It's just decreasing for people going forwards in time.

EDIT: The problem with wounds created by inverted bullets is that the wounds will have inverted entropy. Apparently, this causes her wound to emit radiation (I didn't understand why exactly). Then she inverts her own entropy in order to match the entropy of the wound, which stops her from dying from radiation poisoning, which lets her body heal the wound normally (hence the scarring).",im7etj

g41qw35,"I like your approach, but I share the point that it's somehow cheap to just say: ""Nah, don't try to understand it"". It feels like there is always two ways use something clever in a movie: either explain it or just say: ""This is too complicated to explain"". I prefer the later much more, like in inception for example. It was already heavy on the exposition through the character of Ellen Paige, but the concept got actually explained to such a detail, that everything happening that was of importance to the movie made sense. In Tenet, I felt frustrated. I love new ideas, if they are self consistent. In the movie things were happening and they didn't make any sense even with the brief 'explanation' of inverted entropy + regular non inverted stuff was doing strange things.

g48tnbj,"The cracks getting larger is a very good point, since that does show that the material around the hole is moving forward in time - I hadn't considered that.

But the material that was *displaced* by the bullet definitely moves backwards in time, because the hole gets filled in again once the bullet reverses. For the more obvious example of that, consider the explosions in the final battle. All the debris that's been displaced reforms as the explosion reverses. There's definitely an implication that *some* of the inversion is transferable though it's arbitrary how much. It coincidentally seems to be the exact amount that creates the best visual effect though, so I think ""rule of cool"" applies well enough if you take the film purely as a visual spectacle.

I think I exaggerated with ""very prevalent"", but there's definitely a fair few comments over there that still claim critics rate it low because they don't understand it. That or a more generalised ""they never understand Nolan's work and always rate it low"" with is [demonstrably false](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/christopher_nolan).

gg15vyb,"Forgive me since it’s been three months since I saw it, but I’ll try to elaborate on what I meant. 

Your quoted rule is how it works in the film, yes, but I don’t think it holds up in a full timeline. As you describe, an inverted bullet hits a surface, backwards in time. That bullet hole, it is implied, is inverted, and now travels backwards in time also. I think that’s what you’re saying in that rule, and you’re right that it doesn’t need further explanation than the visuals, *if it could work that way*.

What I’m saying is that it doesn’t make sense that it works that way. That bullet hole now travels backwards in time, further and further. Where does this inversion now end? Does it go back to when the object was created? The bullet hole is just formed in it, and they can’t create the glass pane (or whatever) fully? Or does it only appear when the object moves into that position, suddenly a bullet hole appears in that glass pane as it moves into position?

The idea is absolutely amazing, don’t get me wrong. But in our universe, things function according to cause and then effect. You simply cannot create a system that violates that while also fitting in the laws of physics as we understand it. Similarly, look to the grandfather paradox in time travel.

Moving forwards in time, we know there must be a time when the glass pane was not in that position. Indeed, there is a time where the glass pane had not even been manufactured. In our forward timeline, we have to somehow go from our glass pane not existing, to it being there with that bullet hole in it. The question I believe has no valid answer is: when does the bullet hole appearing in the forwards direction? I’ve given two answers above that I don’t think make sense. There may be another answer I’ve not thought of though.",im7etj

g8nyn73,"Apologies for necroing this a month late (theaters *just* opened in Michigan, so I didn't get to see it until recently) but I have to take issue with the supposed lack of wit.

Why does it feel like every major film need to be witty these days? Pardon the first place winner of r/movies's dead horses, but every Marvel movie feels like a sitcom with the way each interaction is wittier than the last.

I do agree that some of *Tenet*'s dialogue either fell flat or was straight up unintelligible because that's apparently Nolan's thing, but I thought most of it was brilliant. Definitely spy-movie levels of shop talk, but I think that helped to capture the feel of a thriller set in Nolan's world where time and dimension is a theory, not a law.

For what it's worth, I also saw it in IMAX, so that very well could have an impact on how I heard and saw everything. All in all I thought it was brilliant and probably his best work yet.",im7etj

Take Ariadne for example.  Could have been played by a man without changing the script and no one would have batted an eye.  The only reason why that character had to be a woman was because the Greek myth Ariadne was a woman.

And in general, I don’t think you have to have perfect writing to make a good movie (although better writing is preferred).

Nolan’s films are intended to test weird ideas and philosophical theories.  That’s what is important to him, and that’s fine.  Writing is certainly not his strongest suit but he ESPECIALLY falters when writing “feminine women”.",im7etj

This sounds aloof, looking down, it's really not meant as such. Who needs knowledge of wormholes and grandfather paradoxes in their life? Next to no one. Though I know on the very same basic level it is explained in his movies, I certainly don't need that knowledge. I just enjoy SF, so I happened on it before. Old news to me. Nolan just tries to get everyone aboard those concepts. Clunky for the ones that already know, but necessary for those that don't to get the rest of the movie.

I just wish he'd be able to find a more elegant way to introduce it than by clunky dialogue. I certainly don't know how, but then I'm also not offered 100+ million dollar budgets. He really should just get a script writer to polish his initial scripts... which he probably has... so maybe he should actually listen to them.

But then again, why? It works just fine. Sure the minority randos like me are annoyed, but the majority of viewers are presented with some probably never heard before concept and while the dots connect in the brain, they won't care that it was all delivered by clunky dialogue.

The more you think about it, the more it removes the tension from the ending though.  That's kind of the problem with time-travel stories with a singular timeline principle; once you deconstruct it you lose a lot of tension.

g3yhpes,"No.  Things can work backwards over iterations.  That's how the machines themselves managed to get where they are after centuries.  Think of it like a game of telephone but backwards in time.  Once inversion was created, it allowed people to begin working backwards infinitely.  Now future you can deliver information to past you, and present you can take that same information and move it backwards by another increment.  On a linear scale this would take decades for sure.  But the past you would experience this instantaneously, as you wouldn't observe the time elapsed in the future because it hasn't happened in your stream.  That's why they started slowly seeing inverted artifacts from the future bleed into the present at an increased rate.  Once inversion existed, the past was slowly racing backwards towards the present.

Put another way: if tomorrow I invented inversion, I could leave breadcrumbs for the me *now* to know about inversion and how it works.  With this knowledge, I can eventually leap back again and give past me this same information and then some.  And I could repeat this for a decade.  And maybe ten years ago I decide to pass my work onto another friend and confidant, and they complete the same leapfrogging back in time, until eventually someone shows up at Einstein's doorstep and says ""bro relativity is broken""",im7etj
g4388jl,"Sure.  By my understanding, the future chose Sator as a courier of sorts.  They knew the pieces of the algorithm were being inverted and needed someone to catch them as they arrived.  In exchange they gave him a life of wealth and prosperity.  Once the pieces were gathered, Sator merely needed to leave them in a location and send a message to the future of their whereabouts.  

Now this is where I begin merely speculating to the nature of Sator's motives.  My view is that Sator, upon learning of his cancer, suddenly saw the futility of his life.  He amassed all this power and wealth.  He could outmaneuver his enemies in time itself, but he could not escape a disease made of himself and his own history.  If you had a terminal illness, but could already have anything you wanted in the world, how would you give meaning to anything you did? 

So, knowing that the future acquiring the algorithm most likely spelled the end of the known universe, decided to hinge the fate of that universe on his very existence.  It's part ego, part arrogance, part self-actualization.  Most of our lives are insignificant, but he gave his purpose by being God for a moment.  Once he gathered all the pieces of the algorithm, he was literally the master of the universe.  When he chose to die, everything would die with him.  

So he inverted himself and went back to his happiest memory: a getaway with a family that he believed still loved him to some extent.  Upon his death at a time of his choosing, a message (text, email, whatever) would be sent. This message would reach the future in a few centuries to let them know where he buried it, they would work back in time, acquire it, reverse the flow of entropy in the world, and it would cease to exist.  Due to relativity, to Sator this would happen instantaneously at the moment of his death, giving himself a satisfactory end.",im7etj

And that's directly related to there being multiple 3-5 minute scenes where nothing is happening on screen but dialogue and you just can't hear what is being said at all.

gkgz38u,"No, I thought it tried too hard to be the next 2001, and felt like the connections at the end were a little forced. It was just too long, and underwhelming. I appreciate the effort it takes to make CGI that accurately renders a blackhole, is incredibly accurate from a scientific perspective, etc., but I feel like the credit given to him in that regard should be a totally separate category and the film should be judged on its own merits. It is similar to Tenet in that I give him credit for writing a story that takes into account these scientific principles, has action sequences where he is actually crashing a jet, but those things didn't make the movie more enjoyable or entertaining (the jet crash was...incredibly slow and underwhelming in my opinion). I thought that Inception was quintessential Nolan in that he took a great premise with a dose of science and then just ran with it in creating a great story, but in my opinion he hasn't replicated that success on the sci-fi side since then. 

I feel like Tomato-meter critic scores mirror my overall sentiment on each of his movies. Obviously I know it reflects the percentage of critics that gave it a favorable review, but if we take the score as the straight percent-grade, then Interstellar gets a C, Dunkirk is a B, etc. An exception to this is that I think The Prestige's USER score more accurately reflects the movie.

Obviously the above is 100% my personal (layman) opinion. I think when he's ""on"" he is one of the best filmmakers I've ever seen, but I try and be an honest and objective movie-goer when I think he missed the mark. Some more hardcore and objective movie buffs may be able to explain exactly why he misses the mark sometimes, but I will say that in Interstellar, Dunkirk, and Tenet I just didn't enjoy any of the characters, and I cannot make the same statement about the rest of his filmography (for both protagonists and antagonists).",im7etj

Don't want to sound like some pseudo-intellectual Nolan fanboy, but based on that the general opinion ranges from ""it sucks"" to ""meh"", I think this very well may be a film that will only be appreciated and understood later (not talking years or decades necessarily, maybe just a few months, once it settles in for those who have given it a second chance). Like I said to my friend, it's funny how most films get boring and stale after multiple viewings, yet here it's the exact opposite, once you know what's gonna happen, and you have time to think about it and piece it together, you get satisfaction.

To explain why those cars are like that, you have to go back and think of what they're doing in the normal world. Those cars are speeding down the highway.

 (For clarification purposes there's two protagonists in my explanation: ""Red"" = normal time protagonist, ""Blue"" = inverted time protagonist).  
Red creates TENET after the events of the movie. Upon establishing the TENET organization he goes back in time to recruit, at which point he becomes Blue. Blue then recruits Neil and whoever else. Since he's going backwards in time, he reaches a point where there are two protagonists in the same world, Red and Blue (e.g. when Red Kat sees Blue Kat jumping off the yacht).  
So to answer your question about how he became the head of TENET AND recruit himself, it's because technically Blue recruited Red through the people Blue recruited when he went back in time.  
What I don't understand is how he communicated with people in the past to recruit them (since technically he would be communicating inversely). Maybe he just went through a turnstile when he got back in time far enough?? Idk. So many question....",im7etj

Tenet to me felt really focused on the concept of inversion above all else. I do think it's more complicated than the other movies you mentioned once you get into the details of the temporal pincer attacks that were used multiple times.

I think Nolan wanted to do something that was deliberately harder and more complex than his previous films. I don't think there's anything wrong with making a movie that not everybody will like or understand, and it seems awfully unfair to accuse a filmmaker of wasting people's money just because the resulting film isn't universally appealing. You could hardly find a filmmaker who'd be spared from that criticism under close inspection.

It's believed to be less painful than a hammer.

> Why did he link his death to the transmission of the coordinates of the algorithm?

Because the future just needs to know where the algorithm is in order to retrieve it and activate it.  It's also his protection from Tenet.  They can't kill him unless they can be guaranteed to get the algorithm first and ""disarm"" it.",im7etj

As far as the trucks go, there is no shortage of oxygen or supplies in the past. To most people they just look like random truckers. The bigger question to the people encountering them would be why are they driving and behaving backwards all the time. They must have learned how to communicate, behave, and hide in plain sight while inverted, and they also must’ve had lots of money before leaving. I'm sure some of them died or went mad along the way, but maybe, like the space program, Tenet did massive amounts of vetting and training to avoid that.

I can see why your brain would need the protagonist to be from the future, but a primary point is that he’s actually just moving forward linearly while still being the guy who led it all.

In your first viewing, you may not have realized that there were probably more than six inversions of our protagonist at the same time, but that doesn't matter because its not important in understanding the main story.

g5ryjov,"Sator's organization staged a fake terrorist attack (and rescue) in order to actually steal the algorithm from the cia agent. This would allow the CIA agent to be in a position which was vulnerable *and* as if it was not some shadowy organization stealing an unknown artifact.

What I think is revealed at the end of that the opera house scene was just the first part of the time-loop; the protagonist uses the time-loop to change the past and thus iniating the entire rest of the film. This is because they needed Sator to not have the artifact intentionally in order for him to have a reason to meet with the protagonist later on in the film. This is how the protagonist was able to meet with Sator on his boat; he indicates that knows what happened and thus how he might be able to retrieve the artifact. (What is only implied is that actually it was *Tenet* who retroactively stole the artifact). This is why the protagonist would have known that a terrorist attack was going to happen in the first place- because this was done retroactively in the future in order to prevent the disaster at the end of the film.

There is no reason otherwise that the protagonist would have been spontaneously in an unmarked van in front of an opera house. The reason he was able to be there in the first place is because he knew what was going to happen and thus was able to change the past (thereby preventing the end of the future).

I think the artifacts were designed to represent the sections of code through their physical properties? e.g. tungsten-184 casing, 240x262x188mm, 17.8mm thick, 14.2x3mm copper trim at top and bottom of 4 faces, 26mm 45° bevel on 4 vertical edges, next layer is aluminium-26, etc, etc... but down to a microscopic level. Each of those variables gives you a part of the number string. Presumably this is an established method of data storage in her time, so the bad guys would be able to decrypt it once they get their hands on it.

As for who the antagonists are, I kind of like that they're just this faceless, nameless cabal. They're generations away from existing - how could we know more about them, and what would it add? That said, they're apparently extremely wealthy and willing to ignore the warnings of scientists and risk the habitability of the planet/universe in pursuit of their own personal comfort...

g4oc9b5,"Movies' point as a medium is escapism, we watch movies because they aren't like life, I agree that thr movie was emotionally distant on a character point of view, but I don't think it's fair to claim that the movie is ""everything wrong with cinema"", regardless of what you think of the script, it's still an incredibly well choreographed and thought out concept.

g42njvm,"But then you get movies like Enemy and the director himself said no more explanation is needed. And the audience is like what is this? Why is that there? 
Not everyone cares to dissect a film, and film can do more that just act out a story. 
Imagery and emotion can be the art in itself which is what I think a lot of this movie was. 
Having The Protagonist fight his reverse self just to show that you can do that. 
Having an epic battle scene that I don’t think I’ll ever full understand. I’m here for it though.",im7etj
g42dgyn,">I don’t mind movies that require you to think afterwards but if people need to seek out videos to understand what was going on I’d say that’s a failure of the script.

That'd be most of Nolan's films lol

But i guess it's different for everyone. I got Interstellar the first time, others didnt. Others were confused by Inceptions dream stuff, i was confused by what Saito wanted (which was explained before anything complex happened). I get u tho. 

You say its a failiure of the script while others applaud Primer for being 15x as confusing - i personally dont see anything wrong with having to go watch a video to have a movie explained, its like reading lyrics to understand a song better- it can make the experience more enjoyable if you understand it.",im7etj

The soldiers are moving backwards in time. The building is not. Chronologically, the building was constructed and then destroyed at the time of this battle. 

The actions the inverted soldiers take do not convert non-inverted objects. If that was the case, the mere act of The Protagonist walking on the ground would affect that ground. It's not infectious.

Plainly: The actions of inverted people on objects that are moving forward through time do not affect those objects inversely. Inverted actions do affect the pasts of objects being acted upon.",im7etj

He didn’t expect a “future” Kat to be there. I don’t think he realized the exact moment he was coming back to, which is why future Kat cleaned up the fruit so he’d think the version of Kat he was meeting with had not yet been pissed off, but I could be wrong about that detail. “Future” Kat definitely seems to be pretending that everything is fine and they haven’t fought yet.",im7etj

So maybe when they reverse an ""object's"" entropy, they are considering the object as an isolated system in itself. And then they reverse that system's entropy, so instead of increasing, it starts decreasimg. 

This is what I understood.But for this the object has to be an isolated system which it isn't.

The Feynman wheeler hypothesis point is correct though, as they had mentioned it in the movie to not interact with their reverse counterparts or else they'll annihilate.

g400dqd,"I disagree. The fact that there are scenes where inverted and non-inverted characters are simultaneously conversing, interacting, and fighting is what creates tension throughout the film and is the entire conceit of the plot itself. 

Without inversion, this is just a film about stopping one bad guy from ending the world. With inversion, this is a movie about a protagonist being thrust into a plan of his own creation to stop a weak and manipulative man being controlled by people in the far future who are attempting to erase the mistakes of the past, but could actually destroy temporal existence itself in the process. 

Inversion is way more than a gimmick. It's a driving device for the plot that also functions as a themeing to show confrontation between one's current and past selves.",im7etj
g5wvdwh,"Right, and I agree with you on your last point for the most part, I'm not a snob, but fun doesn't equate to perfection, which is what a ""10"" represents.

You understand The Prestige on a first viewing, you're not left puzzling over *everything* but a few crucial parts that had the most narrative impact. And The Prestige offers a lot more nuance and layers upon repeat watches, letting you the viewer recontextualise or relearn what happens.

When Neil is leaving at the end he’s going to go invert and go open the gate. Ives says “I don’t know any locksmiths as good as you.” and Neil says “See? It was me in there, just weaving another tale in the fabric of this mission.” He knows he’s going to die, and we already saw him die.

Plenty of movies like ""2001,"" Tarkovsky's ""The Sacrifice,"" or even Nolan's past work leave certain things up to interpretation while having a comprehensible and engaging story. The problem with ""Tenet"" is that the script doesn't clearly establish basic aspects of the narrative such as who a character is, who they're working for, or what they are doing and why. As a result the film is difficult to follow, not because the structure is outrageously complicated but because the script is underdeveloped. It doesn't help that the sound mixing is uneven so the dialogue (almost entirely exposition) isn't clear either.

Causal loops are inherently insane so there's never actually going to be a real answer. To Nolan's credit, I think he did a fantastic job with staying as logically consistent as one could given the context.

But since it would have to pass backwards through your whole body to become a regurgitated beverage, you'd have to invert your bladder, kidneys, blood, etc. too, which would be impractical.

g5jut6b,"1. The original developer of the Algorithm, in fear of someone copying it or forcing him to copy it, carried the only functioning copy (the artifact) and carried it into the past and put them inside nuke silos (the most heavily guarded place on earth), then killed himself.

2. The future evil people, due to global warming, had to witness Earth getting turned into a hellscape. So they want to invert the entire world to go back to when things were better.

3. Preventing Sator from dying prematurely is just an insurance. If temporal pincer fails, they can keep Sator alive for as long as needed to buy time for them to excavate the artifact from the dead drop. Kat kills Sator prematurely, and now the operation HAS to succeed, or else...

4. The Protag team wants to prevent the inversion of the entire world because that would delete their world. It is mentioned that the universe has a preferring direction of time (forward-time), and events that go against it (reverse-time) slowly “weather away.” Remember the inverted bullet holes in the glass at the Oslo turnstile? If those are inflicted on reverse-time, how long have the bullet holes been there? With this universal flow thing we can kinda theorize that the events of reverse-time would slowly wither away the further they get from the original timeframe; A few hours before Protag and Neil’s arrival, the intact glass would start to magically chip away, and then fully develop into a bullet hole minutes before the actual event. Now, if the whole universe is inverted, the universal flow is also inverted, so the preferred flow would be reverse-time.

I didn't hate the movie for this, of course.  I probably should be less forgiving, but I tend to want to forgive this movie more for that because everything about it relies on things being tightly woven together and less reliant on chance.  

It's not like a thousand random things or people could have happened in an abandoned area with a fixed number of people who are clued into what was the ultimate goal of the mission.  So...yeah, the movie was kind of out of tricks at that point, but it was a neat set of tricks all the same.",im7etj

That is that inversion doesn't just invert time, but also reverses processes (like the fire causing hypothermia).

It still happens that you find black people in trope-ish roles, but it’d actually be more weird if it didn’t because that would be like saying black people aren’t able to play roles like that at all anymore.

SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS

SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS

I mean I can think of plenty off the top of my head, like the fire scene, he lights the fire which proceeds from his lighter along the floor to the truck, which then explodes backwards and freezes the protagonist

If it's inverted so that the explosion is backwards and he freezes, why does it proceed linearly from his lighter to the truck? Surely he should freeze and explode and then the flames go to the lighter? If the fire runs forward relative to protagonist, then why does the explosion run backwards? The freezing is definitely the inverted fire but the fire behaves as if it's both inverted and not.

The protagonist develops a cut in his arm in preparation for when he gets stabbed in reverse, but the cut only appears shortly before he gets stabbed in reverse, so did he heal from the stab wound in like one day?

Why doesn't he absolutely assrape himself in the fight considering he knows what happened beforehand because he did it himself? If he couldn't alter the fight despite already living it then timelines are fixed

It's also explained you can't touch yourself back in time but why can't you talk to yourself? Plot resolved instantly lol

Also the reason they give that you can't touch yourself is that it will cause an annihilation event (in a literal particle physics sense) so why don't you have to strip naked before using the turnstile? If your inverted clothes touch your non inverted clothes that would annihilate. Also you should have to breathe out fully before using the turnstile or the air you exhale after using it will annihilate. On that note why isn't the turnstile a vacuum? The air inside would annihilate with the air outside. This all sounds nitpicky but Nolan wrote in the annihilation rule so it's on him. He could have just not written that rule but he needed a fast lazy way to explain why they can't touch. 

Also, why are they concerned about him annihilating with himself? That would have had to have already happened to his non inverted self before he used the turnstile anyway so there's never a need to warn someone not to touch themselves, according to the rules of the film it's actually physically impossible to be in a situation where you touch your inverted self

If they can communicate with Blue Team enough to do a pincer, just skip the pincer and ask them what happened so you can just cheese reality and win effortlessly

Why does Kenneth Branagh not realise that his wife is there to interfere when he already lived that day on the yacht and she wasn't there the first time? He acts all surprised when she pulls a gun and is totally willing to turn his back on her 

You could just have two people try to pick up the same inverted object in order to determine if timelines are fixed or not

The turnstile window rooms are inconsistent and don't follow any kind of internal logic, they behave one way at certain points in the film and behave another at other points

Why do certain objects seem to become inverted when inverted people touch them and others don't? When protag becomes inverted, he seems to have difficulty driving the car because the car is not inverted.  But if the car is not inverted, how can it crash backwards in the regular timeline? If the car is inverted, why does he have difficulty driving it? If it's not inverted (supported by him having difficulty driving it because he's inverted and it's not) then how can he crash it with regular physics applying from his perspective? They said friction and gravity would work backwards for him. So is the car inverted or not? It behaves as both in different scenes because Nolan wants X or Y VFX shots.

The army woman explains gravity and friction are reversed for everyone else if you're inverted but this clearly isn't true, like I get what she means but she doesn't say it correctly (the way she explains it, if an inverted person grabbed you and pulled down on you they would suddenly shoot up into the air, and if you applied the brakes on a car it would suddenly accelerate and vice versa, and this doesn't happen in the movie).

Basically it was a generic spy action film with a thin veneer of intelligent sounding sci-fi concepts which in the movie only serve to advance the plot in convenient and inconsistent ways and provide excuses for cool VFX shots. Nothing wrong with that inherently but people are acting like it's actually a smart science fiction film, which it isn't. It's only a step above transformers or GI Joe as far as plot, although obviously the directing and score are far better.",im7etj

The entire finale falls flat because if they algorithm is buried then the Red and Blue team just need to dig it up first...and they've got around 50+ years *at minimum* to do so.

They were not trying to blow up the algorithm. Bad guy managed to get his hands on all the parts. The secret was compromised. They tried to retrieve it to hide it anew to once again keep it hidden from the future.

She killed Andreii, which triggered the kill switch (his lacking pulse transmitting) earlier than planned, hence that rope tied to a car, fuck it, escape sequence. (When they were pulled out of the collapsing hole just in time)

The world would end because *activating* the algorithm would reverese time for the whole world. Basically the whole earth earth would live backwards in time, erasing their own past. Wether that would work or just cancel each other out, leading to oblivion for both sides, is unclear, I think. The future guys seem desperate enough to risk that potential outcome.

And apart form behind-the-scenes footage, it's mostly Nolan's philosophy as opposed to marketing material. He isn't opposed to visual effects. He's opposed to an unnecessary reliance on them.

Even compared to Nolan's past films like *Interstellar* or *Inception*, this looks more real. You can tell it's CG in the elevator-shaft (background extension), mirror-shattering, or the Limbo scenes (all the higher buildings and weather effects) in *Inception*. You can tell it's CG in the waves (even the ship in its overhead landing) or Tesseract scenes in *Interstellar*. *Tenet*, on first watch, has almost no noticeable visual effects—the only ones I noticed are the side-view mirror fixing itself during the highway chase and some of the Inverted bullets' debris.",im7etj

Films like *Mission: Impossible—Fallout* don't even cut it in that sense. But, ignoring that sensibility about action, is a film like *Fallout* even that much better? Cavill's characterization was inconsistent and the whole plot is rather predictable and generic (like *Tenet*'s). I don't think *Tenet* is a bad film so much as an immense disappointment.

g4axpbn,"I just thought it was weird the way inverted bullets/weapons affected objects differently from how they affected people. When the inverted bullet reversed through kat she gets wrecked. But when it reverses through a glass window it undoes the damage, same with an explosion on a building all damage gets undone unless its to a person, why?",im7etj
gg2pris,"Oh, I see. That's a good question for sure. I've been thinking about the same concept in two other scenarios:

When they fire two RPGs on that one building from two temporal directions, is that building essentially wiped from existence? 

If an inverted person shoots a normal person, does the normal person lose their entire history of existence?

We've seen a small injury appear on an inverted Protag which eventually grew larger and larger up until the point that he got stabbed. Following that logic, if he died from that fight, then we'd see him die as soon as he goes through the turnstile. If an injury is backwards, so is a death. Probably, his body would teleport straight to the scene of the fight, and the others going through the turnstile with him would just see him vanish. His corpse would up until the point that it got shot, and then it would re-animate. (I assume that the blue team for the final fight saw a bunch of their crew vanish as soon as they inverted) 

*But what if their decision to even go to the airport after getting inverted was made by Protag in the first place?*

I think the movie already addressed this. The movie suggests that the characters have free will, but that free will somehow ends up obeying the law of cause and effect. Maybe this isn't free will then? Neil *decided* to go back to the turnstile to pick the lock near the algorithm. So, Neil or someone around him would similarly decide to go to Oslo to see Protag in the fight where he died. And Neil would see him come back to life, plunged straight into the fight he died from. 

Also, this would mean that inverted people can't ever permanently die from non-inverted causes. All of blue team probably survived at the end. I think this means Neil survives too! 

We've seen nothing like that from regular people - disappearing out of the air, or being inflicted with backwards injuries that gradually grow. This leads me to believe that a timeline can only be affected into the future, and inverted people are the ones ""pushing against the flow of time"" so to speak.

However, that would mean that a regular person seeing bullet holes in walls that get un-shot should be impossible, since a hole should only be able to appear into the future. 

But I'm not going to call this a plot hole before trying to figure it out. 

I posit that this difference comes from the presence of inverted objects, and from significant momentum impacts. A sizable inverted explosion perhaps breaks through the flow of time it's fighting against, and will keep rubble on the ground into the history of that rubble (like an escape velocity). And an inverted bullet being lodged into a wall will keep the hole active into the wall's history.

But how would this affect cause and effect? What if the presence of that rubble on the ground would make history play out differently? If an inverted bullet gets lodged into someone's head, what happens to that person's history, and could they get revived through a ""bullet catch""?

The movie never presents this situation, so we have to resolve this ourselves. Here's one way:

The rubble on the ground might change history, but the altered history will end up converging to the exact same outcome. Just like before, it's the determinism I talked about. 

And maybe an inverted bullet can simply never get lodged in the head of a regular person. Maybe ""temporal physics"" would force it to slip out of the person's head, as if by buoyancy.

I think the explanations I gave could align with anything the movie presented us with. I had to go out of my way to come up with these ideas as the movie never answered these questions. But I don't think the movie presented us with logically impossible scenarios either, and while it could have addressed more, such as how an inverted action on an object affects the object's history, I don't think the movie really needs to address every single concern. I personally fight against the idea of plot holes as much as possible. It's fun to find out how something might be plausible.",im7etj

The team moving backward in time gets to share their knowledge with the team moving forward in time so they can know everything that is about to happen. The whole car chase scene was a big Temporal Pincer Movement by Sator. It is a tactic used by people who move through the turnstiles to help you receive knowledge you learned in the future – it’s how Sator has been devising his plan the entire time. Once the information has been learnt, the idea is to then invert yourself (so you’re travelling backwards), so you can brief either past self or someone else. This, in turn, creates a loop of information. it was used a total of 3 times in the film. At the end they tell you the whole film is actually one big Pincer Movement.",im7etj

Then, on reflection, if there's any information about how the ambush happens, future people will tell Sator, and Sator can avoid it.

I imagine this is how the dead man's switch operates, he will bury the completed algorithm in a place at specific coordinates, and when he dies, the coordinates are sent in some sort of message, which is preserved in the future; those future dicks go get the algorithm and reverse all of Earth's entropy, and the future wins.

This movie is more about accomplishing the objectives rather than understanding the meaning of it all.

That concept of emotional depth really would reasonably apply to one character in the movie and consequently I would argue that her dialogue does convey it.

I do think the exposition is unavoidable because how else can you explain ""the nature of their reality"" or ""non linear time"" to a general audience that doesn't have the attention span or desire to turn their brain on during an action flick.

Like I said though, I don't think the movie is perfect but I do think it accomplished what it was trying to do extremely well. It might seem convoluted but that's sort of the brilliance of it. It's demonstrating the idea of an inverse reality in a seamless way both visually and narratively.

It really isn't.

g474nam,Exactly.  Tenet is a perfect example of what you get when you let a creative genius off the hook to have free unchecked reign.  It seems every time that happens with a filmmaker you don't get the greatest product.  Just look at Rian Johnson and The Last Jedi.  You don't give $250 million dollars to a guy like that and expect the product to not be weird and out there.  Weird and out there is okay for small budget arthouse films.  But when you're spending $250 million on budget and another $200 million on marketing you need to make sure the final product will appeal to the masses.  Tenet will be a financial success in the long run I'm sure but it's probably not what the studio was hoping for.,im7etj

Fire: I belive that because both of them are inverted the fire behaves normaly. But good point, however that is my explanation. 

Stab: I think a lot of time passes, on the boat theres like a week of worth of time, plenty of time to heal from a stab that is made from a locking picking tool. not a knife. 

Figth: well, first he's a bit clumpsy, but if you look closely (I actually thought of that in the movie why is this guy so good at fighting in the begining but then turns quite shitty(?)) I think he's just learning, also he realises he's figthing with himself, if he gets to touch him it's game over, o I guess his priorty is to just bail, and ""de-invert"". 

I don't get what you say about hte anihiliation part. 

What pincer? I dont think the communicated betweem the blue and the red team... They did syncronize an attach to a building , but that was a cronographed attack. like blow up the building at minute 5 kind of thing. 

Well, I think he simply does not care, remember if he dies everything is fullfilled, hell he wants to die. Why worry if she kills him, also as stated before in the movie he beliefs that she does not have it in her to kill him.

Don't get that point of the timelines. I think it's stated that there are multiple timelines. maybe i'm wrong though. 

The car is a good point, might have to rewatch it, but i think the car is not inverted. 

Army women: I don't think what you are saying is true, at least I did not hear that statement from the army girl. Again maybe I wrong will watch again :) 

Last statement: I don't agree with you, it's true that the movie has its flaws but I belive it's quite good and interestin. I give nolan props for always trying to tell refreshing and new stories. I belive Tenet is a solid film. 7.5/10

> If it's inverted so that the explosion is backwards and he freezes, why does it proceed linearly from his lighter to the truck? Surely he should freeze and explode and then the flames go to the lighter?

That's exactly how it would appear to an observer moving FORWARD through time.  We are seeing it through Protag's POV who is moving BACKWARDS.

> If the fire runs forward relative to protagonist, then why does the explosion run backwards? The freezing is definitely the inverted fire but the fire behaves as if it's both inverted and not.

The explosion doesn't run backwards (from Protag's POV).  It explodes and then the aftermath appears to be in reverse (smoke falling instead of rising) since time is still running backwards here.  So an observer moving FORWARD would see smoke rising -> explosion in reverse -> flames going into lighter.

Leaving no time for the Tenet squad to go dig it up because once the future people reverse the flow of time for the world, the Tenet people run out of time, the world is destroyed.

I doubt it. It wasn't violent or bloody at all. It was filmed in the exact same way as the Joker pool table scene. 

He smacks the dudes hand twice with the grater, but it's shot from behind the enemies back, so you see nothing. 

Then, he pins the dudes face and for all of 1.5 seconds, you get a nice close up of his face being dragged across the counter (no blood, no gore, just close up of a shiny metal object holding his head down). Then, as he rips with extreme vigor, it snaps back to a wide shot with zero closeup detail. Dudes head might not have even been in frame, idk it happens quick. 

The idea is though, once you realize what he's doing with the grater, it does make you wince a little at the thought. But wasn't bloody or gory.",im7etj

g451nx1,The difference between Fallout and Nolan movies to me is that Fallout didn't feel like it was taking itself super seriously plot-wise. MacQuarrie and Cruise knew they were making a loud and bombastic action movie with the story written around the setpieces and didn't try to be anything other than that. Nolan's more recent movies on the other hand just have this pretentious feeling about them that's hard to describe.,im7etj
g431kja,"I loved Fallout! To be honest the more recent Mission Impossibles have been great. And I agree, the cinematography was great, but this film doesn't come close to Dark Knight, Inception, Dunkirk, hell even Interstellar. 

This felt like a quick cash grab. I agree with you I need to see it again but I was very hype for this film. I just couldn't have cared less about Kat and her story and her getting shot. I thought the whole movie was going to take a different direction when we see Sator go inverse and shoot her. Never would have guessed it would have been a rescue mission after that. Just boring to me. .

Also this same issue is present with the cars that move backwards, despite not ever going through a turnstile. Take the side view mirror that was broken before ever getting hit, it doesn't make sense because that car was never inverted and crack in the mirror technically never happens even though it ""unhappens"" at one point.

Things like the side view mirror and the bullet holes, should never have a chance to unhappen because in forward moving time, they never happened in the first place.",im7etj

g44e0o0,"Ok so I just rewatched it, and I could seem to understand the dialogue better this time. I'm pretty sure about most of this, and a little unsure about some of it.

So the Algorithm is ""the formula in physical form"" of how to reverse entropy. If the bad guys in the future obtain it, they will understand the science of to reverse the entropy of whatever they want. The Algorithm is comprised of the 9 metal pieces we see, and were sent into the past by the scientist of the future. All of this is told to the Protagonist by Priya in Oslo. 

If the bad guys from the future learn how to reverse entropy at will, they will begin inverting absolutely everything they possibly can to fuck the past world up. They don't care about the possibility of the grandfather paradox. All of this is told to the Protagonist by Neil in the shipping container. 

The plan of the future bad guys is to obtain the Algorithm by sealing it in a capsule under the hypocentre at the end. If Sator seals the Algorithm in the capsule and blows the hypocentre up, the Algorithm will be sealed there and the future bad guys can dig it up and learn the secrets of entropy. The bomb is linked to Sator's heartbeat. If he dies, the bomb will go off and seal the Algorithm down there for the future bad guys. This is why Ives explains the briefing that they have to fail to disarm the bomb, but retrieve the Algorithm without Sator knowing. That way the capsule will be empty when the bad guys dig it up in the future. 

...

I think this is correct.... I know that I get it more than when I first watched it for sure. My next question is that even if the bomb did go off, wouldn't Tenet still be able to retrieve it in the present? Probably a question for someone else..",im7etj

At first I thought the movie was being shown backwards in a way hence the awkward dialogue and blocking. I understand some blocking was intentionally done ""backwards"" but at other times it didn't.

Just really a disorienting movie to watch until The Protagonist meets the main villain.",im7etj
g3y9i3x,"Because he meets with NO ONE.  He used her to introduce him to Sator. Remember the dinner scene he was invited to for an introduction? He was told by the Indian lady to dangle the Plutonium in front of him, because they knew he would be interested in it. But it didn’t end up being Plutonium. It was a piece of the algorithm. Which is why Sator was so interested. Sator gave him the gold brick to get money to fund the operation. Honestly these were basic parts of the plot that were laid out there fairly well.",im7etj
g3ydcud,"The one thing that I don't understand about the pincer movement, is the team moving backwards. Don't they need to be *ahead* of the B team, like in the future, so that they can therefore go inverted and meet the B team to exchange information?

Or, in Timeline A, as they're moving forward linearly, do they enter the foray after the event has past, so they can approach it invertedly?

Really cool to see that Göransson was involved with that song too. I think the score was probably the best part of Tenet. Just kept me on the edge of my seat the whole movie. I might not have understood the plot or dialogue, but damn did I love how the score sounded.",im7etj

Now you can make the argument that film is still better than digital (in most cases it's not anymore). But even in the cases where film is better, that is only the case for filming, not projecting. I read an article a few years back, that even though 35mm film has the equivalent of around 3.5K - 4K digital, when filmed on it. A 35mm copy of a film has the equivalent of at best 1.5-2K when projected during opening week, and something like 1-1.5K after that.

Debicki’s character is the emotional center, yes, but in my opinion poorly executed. Obviously not every movie needs an emotional core, but for these complicated movies where it’s easy to get lost or stop caring, it would go a long way in maintaining investment or even providing moments to breathe in the complex journey the movie takes you on. It accomplishes what it sets out to do, just like a 12x12 rubik’s cube would.

g63z9g9,"The movie talks about these paradoxes a lot of the time and intentionally leaves it a little ambiguous.  Probably the best explanation is the multi-verse theory which is also used in Avengers.  If you go back in time, you can kill your own grandfather without disappearing because you're not affecting your original past, you're affecting a spin-off.  Or you can assume that nothing can be changed and that the answer is you can go back in time and become your own grandfather because you went back in time and became your own grandfather, it was always that way, it's a closed loop (that's the Futurama approach).  That second way calls into question a lot about free will (something Tenet also mentions with one or two lines of dialogue) so I don't like it as much.  But it's also possible that maybe it's correct and we don't actually have free will anyway.",im7etj

Also, if my armchair theoretical is wrong, it still doesn't matter if it's a bootstrap paradox or not because it's nothing more than a blockbuster movie masquerading as a sort of high science theoretical lecture. It's not some sort of great film in the grand scheme of film, it's just spectacle.",im7etj

It's totally possible you're right, but I just find it hard to believe that Nolan wants us to buy that other people on the water would never have noticed those waves.

I didn't really think he was driving the car in reverse after he went through the timestyle, I thought it looked like he was just driving it down the wrong way of the highway in an attempt to catch up to Sator. It was just the accident that appeared in reverse the first time around. He's controlling the car, and causing something new to happen. And with the boat, they're not controlling it, they're just living the boat's journey in reverse; they just got on a boat that had come from where they wanted to go. 

But this is also a movie where a character says ""don't try to understand it"" so I'm pretty sure that was Nolan giving us all middle finger.",im7etj
g42jccc,"For the boat, it's not being driven by the protagonist just like how they traveled back to Oslo in a shipping container that came from Oslo a week ago. That's why the ship looks to be going backwards for the protagonist because he is going back in time. I hope you're getting my point.

The Protag in the opera house is definitely a newbie to everything going on around him (with respect to the activities of the Tenet group or Sator group), save for him being a CIA operative whose mission is to save the one dude “with the package” (that turns out to be an artifact of the Algorithm).",im7etj
g5taolz,"I think you're right that JDW is only aware of this after the fact via the movie. But JDW is sent back to be at the opera house by the future Tenet organization.

If you listen carefully to the dialogue at 1:50 between JDW and Priya the arms dealer she tells JDW that he ""wasn't the only possible choice"" and implies that the organization ""Tenet"" was founded by future peoples to change the past in order to save the world.

In other words, the protagonist (JDW) learning about the scene is new for him, but not new for the setup of the Tenet organization.

This is why JDW story line makes sense to us and the viewer. As we experience the plot we both assume the opera house scene was just about plutonium until its revealed that it was actually the algorithm which was located at the opera house, thus changing the whole rationale for JDW's presence.",im7etj

Edit: doesn’t feel right as in them both being on the boat at the same time

Edit edit: wait but if what’s happened happens and what happens happened then only future sator experienced that moment because things do not change. So then how does he know that it’s his favorite moment before he experiences it? I’m confused too. I guess the ultimate question is where is old sator and how does he know that moment happened.

Edit edit edit: confirmed old sator was NOT on the boat. Earlier in the movie kat says he “disappeared” but later on we find he’s just dead and it was future sator so old sator is off somewhere else. Maybe old sator hears about it from her and he puts two and two together and goes back at the end because he thinks he kills himself but it’s really her that kills him.",im7etj

g4hbpvm,"Yeah. A logline or pitch needs characters doing something active to get what they want. Experiencing something isn't active, if that makes sense.

Yup. It's lacking a catch. Oh good lord yeah. It's almost like, the time mechanic is the only actual thing in the movie, if that makes. The mechanic itself is what the movie is about, versus Inception, where the mechanic was a way for characters to go through a story. And that's kinda lame.

Yeah, losing the mechanic would allow you to tell an actual story. But at the same time, it's like, if you lose the mechanic, there's no reason for the movie to exist. It exists FOR the mechanic, that way people go ""woah"". And I don't think that's great storytelling.

And yup! The mechanic isn't even used all that cleverly. It's just there. It all makes sense though, why the movie is the way it is. It's such a complicated and dense mechanic, as I think I've already said, that to pull it off, the only thing you're left with IS the mechanic, and nothing else. No character, no story logic, and no emotion. And all that is apparent in even the actual pitch for the story.

Shame, really, since Nolan is very capable of telling stories with compelling characters. I guess he decided to forgo that this time around, just to pull of his mind-bending plot mechanic that, to be fair, really has never been done before.

Maybe you get small snippets of back story scattered through the story but the majority of Batman Begins is not about Batman, it’s about Bruce Wayne putting up with the shitty version of Gotham City and showing how he fights back. Keaton’s Batman from scene 1 already establishes that Batman is out and about already. You pretty much get an hour into the movie without seeing him as Batman at all.

I get why they needed the car chase to explain Sator intercepting the part and show Protagonist saving the wife, but was there a reason they gave that they were in Estonia?

First the obvious thing. Time travel movies never make sense. :)

Second the uuuuh 'logic' this all hinges on, as I unterstand it, is that the invention allowed 'backwards in time moving things/ people/ actions' to coexist in paralell. They coexist by moving in opposite temporal directions and can influence each other when they meet.

Everything exposed in the future to whatever this technology is, is immune to retroactive past changes. These things reached that point in time safely, exposed to the technology, thereby ripped out of the normal flow of time and safely placed in the reverse stream. Or it's some sort of paradox safe field or something.

In a similar vein, what came 'first' in a sense was our normal time stream chugging along, then the invention itself in our future. All we see happens 'after' in a sense. So things that allow cross time conflicts, even seeming paradoxes to occur are possible because the invention came 'first' in the future, before any conflict could take place yet because there was no reason for any conflict yet.

To answer you question more directly, none of this conflict could happen if the technology wouldn't exist, so that means the technology, however it does so, has to have the power to ensure it exists no matter if someone kills the scientists that made it. So yeah, I think it rips whatever it touches, as well as itself, from the normal timestream and places itself and everything it touches in a reverse stream, that is now *just as natural* as the original one. They can interact, but what is destroyed in one can't affect the 'past of each other, only their future.

Since that invention, fucking with the past is made possible, but also 'safe to do so' without influencing what made it possible to happen in the first place.

But that's just for what we saw. What would happen if the actual 'reverse all tepmporal polarity for everything'-device is activated was out of the scope of this movie. I mentioned it above. I think it's unclear if this would work and the future would step by step erase the past by living backwards through it, or if they would cancel each other out leading to mutual destruction, was never answered or even asked really.

That's how I explained it to myself, mind. I hope any of this made sense. I does to me, but it's hard to put it into words. The movie absolutely stays vague on this. Not saying I'm right at all. I'm probably over-thinking this and the practical answer is ""Because it looks cool, don't think about it."" :D",im7etj

The more I think about it, the more I keep coming back to the scene where the scientist is explaining that inverted objects are controlled by instinct. Knowing you're going to pull an object from a tavle up into your hand and whatnot. 

That alone adds a bit of a fantastical magical element to the film that I'm betting is how Nolan would explain away a lot of nitpicks like this.

And if anything went wrong, they can fix it by going backwards in time and telling themselves again how to do it right the next time. 

If you watch the beginning of the sequence carefully, you’ll see Andrei lingering near the red-tinted entrance to the temporal stile, staying behind and instructing his men to tell him everything that happens. That’s because he’s planning a temporal pincer: If the handoff doesn’t go smoothly the first time through, he’ll know exactly what happened, and he’ll be able to stop it as he moves backward through time. The tricky part is that the movie implies that this has already happened before the first time we see the Protagonist and Neil successfully grab the 241. (This will make more sense in a moment.) That’s why we see an inverted, gas mask–wearing Andrei holding Katherine hostage after they’ve pulled off the heist (and why you can also see him sitting behind the wheel of a car as the Protagonist is marched into the warehouse). The Protagonist tricks Andrei by removing the 241 from its case and exchanging an empty case for Katherine’s life. And he hides it by—hold onto your butts—handing it off to a backward-moving version of himself, who has caught up with the forward-moving Protag. (The movie cuts away after they lock eyes the first time through, but you can see the handoff the second/reversed time.) But once Andrei realizes the 241 is in the car the reversed Protagonist stole, he performs a second temporal pincer, knowing that as soon the reversed Protagonist places it in his car, it will be waiting for Andrei in the future. All Andrei had to do was figure out where the Protagonist put it, and then find the right point in time to grab it from him.",im7etj

This is complicated at the end of the film when its seemingly revealed that *he*, the protagonist was actually the founded of the organization years ago. I believe what this means is that in the traditional story line JDW  main run-through represents if you will ""the first inversion,"" where people in the future set in motion the organization to save the world after awareness of the scientists actions became known.

What really doesn't fit, then, is a paralleled story about the CIA and an unrelated Ukrainian organization attempting to steal plutonium at an opera house.

The fire exists in the ambient environment, so it should run backwards like the birds flying backwards. It doesn't. This implies the fire is going in the same direction in time as the protag. Therefore it should not freeze him.

>  It was not about the spinning top, it was about his kids.

There was zero emotional investment in the final act - the Protagonist doesn't even have a name. It is purely about ""Save the World"" without the emotional stakes either.

> I was talking about how there couldn't have been good guys in the future to come back and dig it up because the Algorithm would've been activated if it wasn't retrieved.

Except the film does a piss poor job of establishing anything consistent. The algorithm being buried was meant to be found in the future and activated then - yet they were also saying it would activate the moment that Sator dies. Everything about it is a convoluted and problematic attempt at artificially creating stakes out of nothing. My point is that if, at any time, the item is buried and the good guys *know* when it is buried then it would - ***at any point*** be dug up by the good guys. The good guys wouldn't stop existing in the timeline unless they completely failed - which is why the plan was never going to succeed based on the parameters set: the heroes literally have 50+ years to dig up, dismantle and hide the algorithm once they learn the location of the drop. the Algorithm actually has to reach the antagonists in the future before it can be used to kill everyone - and, at that point, it's pretty fucking well deserved if 50 (or a hundred+) years go by and your heroes can't pull together to win an assault over a buried object.",im7etj

g42wm0e,"This is a sillily bad-faith conclusion for why the film is as flawed as it is. Nolan has always appreciated action-cinema and thrillers. That's apparent in all of his work, including *Batman Begins*, which released before *The Prestige*.

Just as with *Inception*, Nolan didn't put in the effort or time to resolve all of the problems that arose during the screenwriting process. This time, though, the problems are greatly exaggerated in *Tenet* because of a host of reasons: the film is more complicated than *Inception* in that the rules can't be explained away or prevaricated due to variability within the abstract dream world; the actors (particularly John David Washington) and other collaborators seem to have been far more reluctant to press Nolan for logical answers, and simply trusted him; and Nolan is a decade older, meaning he's over the hump and declining in intelligence.

*Tenet* has more holes in its story than *Inception*, but they're even more apparent because *Inception* is far more intrinsically engaging—it also handles its exposition in a far better manner. It's sad, though. *Tenet* feels like a first draft. I don't doubt Nolan put effort into it; I doubt he put in the amount necessary given the material and his age.",im7etj
g42iwtc,"From our POV, Protag and Sator are moving FORWARD.

The rest of the world is moving BACKWARDS.

The lighter, fire, and explosion are an extension of Sator's action, and proceed FORWARD.  This is cause and effect from our POV but reversed from the POV of the world.  If cause always had to happen before effect, your view would be correct and a person moving backwards would not be able to interact with the world (it would be impossible to cause anything).  The scientist at the beginning mentioned this is not the case.

I think your mistake is that the fire itself isn't inverted, rather that Protag himself is.  The army woman mentions that moving BACKWARDS causes his heat transfer to be reversed so the fire would freeze him.  If the fire itself had its entropy reversed, it wouldn't burn (no longer a spontaneous reaction).",im7etj

g4fv94t,"This depends on if the people left because they just hate action movies or something, or if they were confused by the film. If it was the latter, I don’t think sunk cost is a good example here because unlike constantly investing in a shitty stock or any other example that more or less involves chance, I’d be willing to bet that finishing a movie has a very high chance of resolving a lot of issues one may have with said movie by the end of it, especially confusion wise. A high amount of films leave you with questions until the end when things are wrapped up (Tenet is no exception).

It would make sense to leave early on or even halfway maybe (confusing movies aren’t for me, I’m out), but if you’ve spent all that time in the movie (over 2 hours at this point) and are 25 minutes away from the end with a high chance of getting more out of the experience than you would by leaving early, sunk cost doesn’t really apply to me. It WOULD if you absolutely cannot stand it whatsoever and that your leaving has nothing to do with understanding the film. Like if you hate action movies, and you stay for the whole thing anyway, you’d be right, sunk cost, why stay if you know in your bones that this movie is not for you. But if you leave because you’re confused after sitting there for almost the whole movie, imo it does no good to leave so soon before the end, where there’s a high chance things will be shown to be a bit more clear.

This can be said of any modern action-movie, including *Bloodshot*. What actually matters is the general reception and word-of-mouth, and *Tenet* is a demanding and emotionally unpalatable film. The film has now received a ""B"" from Cinemascore.

>promising a ""mind bending plot""

I didn't realize that audiences are particularly enthused by mind-bending plots considering that all of the highest-grossing films have very simple plots.

>starring the guy from Oscar winning BlackkKlansman and two very recognisable actors from incredibly popular YA series

Starring the man from that almost independent film that made less than one hundred million at the box office. Additionally starring Robert Pattinson whose apparent star power has brought great box office returns to *Good Time*, *High Life*, and *The Lighthouse* over the past decade. Also starring Clémence Poésy for half a minute.

>I'm not sure you really understand the money making side of the film industry.

I'm not sure you really understand the money-making side of the film industry.

> If the plot was actually complex and deep then maybe it would be risky.

The film is wildly complex for the average filmgoer. So complex, that when paired with the poor soundmix, few will know any of the greater intricacies of the plot.

>Tenet however is none of those things and an incredibly safe bet.

No, *Tenet* is not. It's a safe-ish bet only in the context of Nolan's past performance. The final product is not highly consumer-friendly; I doubt the script was either considering it was 180+ pages. Considering the quickly shoehorned-in single by Travis Scott and nearly exact 2:30:00 runtime, it seems apparent that Warner Brothers themselves became concerned with the film's prospects.

Is *Tenet* a better bet than *The Man from U.N.C.L.E.* or *King Arthur: Legend of the Sword* were? Obviously so. Is *Tenet* a safer bet than any superhero film or similarly large and pre-existing IP? No. Studios tend to evaluate films based on the latter question.

High-budget, original science fiction has a tendency to fail, including *Edge of Tomorrow* (though, it's technically not original)—a film with greater reviews than *Tenet* and more star-power.

You're so full of shit. Now your newly edited excuse is that you didn't ""literally"" mean it. Take some time to learn what sarcasm is too.

Let's look at *Interstellar* as a point of reference. *Interstellar* made a profit of $47 million according to *Deadline*. *Tenet* has a budget that is approximately $40 million to $60 million greater than *Interstellar* by most sources. Expecting *Tenet* to gross over $700,000,000 is a big ask and something *Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation* failed to accomplish.

>Edit: ah, instant downvote within 20 seconds of my reply. You know downvote isn't the ""disagree"" button right?

Do you have any self-awareness? I am returning the favor you had started. Does Karma even matter? No. But what's more distasteful than your own Downvoting (and hypocritical whining) is how you've attempted to insult my knowledge or intelligence.

To reiterate the now rigidly obvious, *Tenet* was not a safe bet. But based on your attacks on Nolan's supposed motivation and resistance to any reasoning, you seem not to genuinely care for whether *Tenet* actually was a safe bet or not; you'd likely insist it was a safe bet even if it had cost $300,000,000.

Are you ever going to finish editing your comment and meaninglessly expounding? To clarify, media interest doesn't represent filmgoer interest, otherwise *Blade Runner 2049* would have been a roaring success. Similarly, most audience members can not tell the difference between the effects of a film like *Tenet* or *Bloodshot*. Action is action to them.
