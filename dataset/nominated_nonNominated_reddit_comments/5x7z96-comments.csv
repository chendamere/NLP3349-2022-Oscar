Also tore me up when laura finally called him daddy. Fuck...

Such great world building tho, really felt like an accurate, solid depiction of what 2029 will be, realistically. The self driving 18wheelers were a nice touch.

degvm46,"One small thing I liked about the movie was how they depicted the ""future."" Most movies will make the future out to be either this technological utopia with flying cars and robot butler's or a dystopia that is equally far-fetched. The ""futuristic"" elements seemed very much more realisitic in this movie as in real life technology is adapted slowly on a large scale so minor things like the TV in the hotel looking similar just bigger, to the more obvious things like the self driving trucks looked more like they were built off of current things we have instead of a total 180 from present society.

I hope this movie (alongside Deadpool) paves the way for R rated superhero movies in a variety of genres. With real respect for the characters and source material there is no reason why we can't have more big budget and high quality superhero movies like Logan.

It's so unflinchingly dark from start to finish. It honestly reminds me of The Last of Us in so many ways -- the side story at the farmhouse which ends with nothing but more death, the cross-country journey, and of course the relationship between Logan and Laura. 

The brutality of it all really caught me off guard. I honestly can't imagine how this movie could've been made without an R rating, even if some of the language and the brief flash of nudity is unnecessary. And all the action is so no-frills, too. A lot of people get stabbed, but there aren't any flashy set pieces to get in the way of the blood and decapitations. Even every major character death happens so fast with no room for closure. 

I also have to say that final shot was tremendous. It's always the small details that hit the hardest, and goddamn what a detail.

I had no idea what to expect from Logan, but I can already tell it's gonna stick with me for a while. What a bleak, fucked-up universe this is.",5x7z96

deg0evh,"Logan is probably the best superhero movie I've ever seen in terms of character development, action, and making the stakes feel real. So many nowadays (Age of Ultron, Suicide Squad, BvS, etc.) throw away anything genuine in favor of mass spectacle. 

I've always l Ioved Hugh Jackman in this role, and he finally got the chance to do something beyond just growling and making faint references to the pain he's in. I felt so bad for Wolverine in this movie (and Xavier, and the kids!).

The action was so intense because it all felt real, you really felt every stab or gunshot he took with his lack of healing. And that part near the end when he went full berserker was just fantastic. 

The thing I really loved was the character moments. They actually took the time to slow the movie down and really make you feel for every character. That entire segement with the family on the farm was something i never expected from this movie. When Xavier said he didn't deserve that good day, I felt so bad for him. When Wolverine was dying and finally felt what it was like to have a family, I cried. 

I could keep going but it'll turn into an even bigger wall of text than this already is, Logan is a fantastic send off to Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. It's emotional, intense, has the type of action you've always wanted out of Wolverine, and was never boring. I can't wait to see it again.

P.S. Good on you Fox for putting Deadpool at the beginning, it really wouldn't have worked after that ending.",5x7z96
deg00t6,"I feel like this was Wolverine's coming of age movie. Also, thank goodness they went for rated R. They were able to really dig in and show the kind of life Laura had up until that point.

deg1r13,"I almost expected the gravestones to move at the end. I'm glad they didn't. The overall ambiguous story ending is something I have to chew on, but I think I'll like it more as time goes on.

This is not a movie to hang a franchise on. And that in itself is a surprising and brave decision. This may change if the main X-Men franchise doesn't do well but for now, this is perhaps the right movie for the right time, and is about as perfect as you can ask for.

While I've been tempering my box office expectations, I wouldn't be surprised if this ended up doing Deadpool money. And it deserves it.

Oh and I want to praise Dafne Keen for essentially carrying scenes by herself. I expect to see more of her in the future.",5x7z96

deg1wgd,"I honestly think that was the best comic book film since Dark Knight.  It just realized what people wanted in a Wolverine film.  It was dark gritty, beautifully shot.  I mean it was amazing",5x7z96
deg29vb,"This was the wolverine movie i've been waiting for since i first saw the 2000 xmen trailer. The fight scenes were superb and had real weight to them. In fact there was one moment where Laura bounces off someone much larger than her rather than taking him down which was a nice touch. You really get a sense of what a perfect killing machine Wolverine actually was. Finally did justice to the old line ""i'm the best there is at what i do, and what i do isn't very nice""

**Spoilers from here on out**

I thought the story was great, and the weakening of Wolverine was well executed with the adamantium poisoning finally taking its toll on his body. Charles having a degenerating brain disorder causing him to be the most dangerous man on the planet was great and it was interesting they switched the 'Old man Logan' plot point of Wolverine destroying the xmen to Charles; whilst leaving some ambiguity as to what specifically happened.

Laura was fantastic, you really got a sense of what Logan might have been like during his early days with weapon X (properly this time) through seeing what an incredible killing machine she was.

I thought the main villain was pretty good. With a character like wolverine it's hard to make a decent villain that can go toe-to-toe with him without weakening him unless they have adamantium or an equal healing factor. So I thought it was cool that the main antagonist was just a mercenary type who used the assets he had available and who didn't even really care about Logan, just the cargo he was now carrying. 

I think the Xander probably could have done with a bit more screen time and development, i felt he kinda just appeared without really going into how he was the guy in charge and the real threat to the children.

Now I have a feeling x-24 is going to be quite a decisive character, but I thought he was the perfect final antagonist for Logan. Seriously, who better for Logan to face off against, here at the end of it all, than his own worst enemy; himself. Logan has to defeat himself at his worst, pure rage and animalistic brutality. I thought the symbolism of the fight and the consequences of it, win or lose, was fantastic. And the parallels with Laura, both being two sides of Wolverine, was cool. Not to mention dying by his own hand.

I was expecting Logan to have to kill Charles after we see the first couple seizures but they probably didn't want to make it too similar to X3 or similar tropes. Instead the result developed Logan and Laura's relationship which was nice.

One thing that might have been nice was a bit more of a reaction from Logan after learning what she went through and what she is, considering how deeply traumatic the weapon x program and what was done to him was. There was a nice final line from Logan to Laura regarding this, but a little bit more might have been nice earlier just of Logan alone or with charles.

Also I think the death was so much better than 'Death of Wolverine'. Was a truly fitting end for Logan to not only die by his own hand but to tell his 'daughter' not to become like him.",5x7z96
dehzi23,"Not sure if anyone else has had to deal with a family member having Alzheimer's or any brain degenerative illnesses, but seeing Charles in the beginning really broke my heart cause it felt so real. People laughed when he was rambling incoherently and saying random things and swearing a lot, but that's how it was when my grandma had it before she passed.

On a lighter note, seeing Logan tearing up through bodies in the forest after taking the serum was very uplifting, as it was like seeing how he was in his prime one last time

This was a brutal, dark, and beautiful film. Hugh Jackman and the cast did an excellent job, a great farewell to the series  ",5x7z96
deg84si,"A rage-fueled, spanish-speaking, heart-breaking X-23 is something I didn't know I needed in my life until I saw Logan. I loved the pacing throughout the film. There were moments of high-octane ultraviolence, but they were woven between drawn out moments of compelling character interactions. The biggest negative I could think of were the scenes where the cgi really stood out as unrealistic. Particularly during the last act. They didn't detract from the overall experience, though. 
I watched the film this afternoon in Busan, and I was one of the last ones to leave the theater along with a middle-aged Korean woman. We shared the elevator out of the theater and she was just wiping away the tears. It was a powerful ride, regardless of anyone's dedication to the X-Men series.

Such a great film. My favorite ""superhero"" movie since The Dark Knight. I've been watching Hugh Jackman's Wolverine since I was in elementary school. I'm glad they found such a fantastic way to end his saga.",5x7z96
deg1fmf,"[As soon as Xavier got stabbed I was convinced he was going to wake up and it would all have been a dream, that type of fake-out has been done so many times. When the movie kept going I was genuinely fully shocked, they did a really good job at keeping the X-24 thing hidden which I guess is easier because they didn't have to cast someone new and then have people speculating and guessing it. Saying that though I think it would have worked a lot better with Daken than Jackman vs. Jackman, obviously they're keeping him open as an option for future films and so wouldn't have allowed him to be used, although the symbolism of Logan fighting himself is obviously powerful so maybe I'm completely wrong.](#spoiler) 

Also please please please can we just get X-23 in the normal X-Men continuity, I don't care if they don't explain it at all, I don't care if Deadpool and Cable just turn up and time travel her over, the timeline's fucked, at least take advantage of that and utilise one of the best castings ever as much as you can.",5x7z96

Everyone loves the Father-Daughter duo with Wolvie-X23 but I think such an underrated aspect to Laura's maturation and trust to Logan is Xavier.  Xavier is the bridge to Logan. Logan is the bridge to Laura. Laura the bridge to her friends. 

The discovery of Laura gave a jolt of life and strength Xavier. When he tells Logan about her Logan thinks he's just being delusional. When we first meet her he's in his wheelchair inviting her in. From here we see Laura grow very fond of Xavier very quickly. When Logan is driving off in the limo and the Reavers are shooting at the back, Laura literally moves Xavier out of the way in front of her body to shield him from the bullets. We also see Xavier defend her every instance. When Laura's curiosity peaks at the outfit in the glass, it's Xavier that tells Logan to buy it for her. When Laura starts pressing buttons on the elevator, Logan gets pissed and Xavier reminds her she's just a child. When Logan stops Charles' seizure at the hotel, the first thing Laura does after finishing off one of the Reavers on the ground, she immediately goes to hold Charles' hand. When they're on the interstate and she's locking and unlocking the door, Logan gets mad and once again Charles defends her. Charles told her that Logan wanted to kill himself and told her to not let him. When Charles gets impaled by X24 we immediately see Laura go on the attack to protect him. When Xavier is dead in the back of the pickup, Laura's reaction (Dafne's acting) was absolutely perfect. She had just lost an influential father figure she never had. Someone that not only understood her, but embraced her and had compassion for her past. 
  
***This to me just showed that Charles Xavier's most talented gift all along wasn't his psychic abilities, it was his compassion and care for fellow man and mutant.*** The way he immediately becomes a grandfather figure/best friend to Laura, showing her they can be trusted is exactly what brought him back out of his depression and makes him feel whole again. That he can help another mutant that needs guidance. When Logan tells Charles the coordinates are from a comic book and aren't real, Charles tells him it's real to her. When Logan brings up Charles running a school, you can see how much it brings life and happiness back into Charles talking about it. Charles was one thing Laura and Logan had in common, and his death ends up bringing them together.

Edit: Not sure how I forgot this, but Laura and Xavier were both watching Shane when Xavier opened up to her about first seeing it when he was her age. It ends up being the speech Laura gives at Logan's burial!",5x7z96

They never got to see the X-Men, only heard and were told about them and read about them in a comic. The only and last thing they'll ever have seen about the X-Men was one of their idols rescuing them, running in the woods at 100mph and sacrificing himself for them.

""For me, what was most interesting in getting the studio to O.K. an R rating was something entirely different. They suddenly let go of the expectation that this film is going to play for children. And when they let go of that, you are free in a myriad of ways. The scenes can be longer. Ideas being explored in dialogue or otherwise can be more sophisticated. Storytelling pace can be more poetic and less built like attention-span-deficit theater.""

deier1b,"I find myself coming back to this thread again and again, because it's been an entire day and I still can't help but think about the movie. 

Man, I think that generally speaking this is one of the most sharply directed movies ever. So many movies out there today suffer from tonal inconsistencies, forget comic book movies, and yet it feels that James Mangold knew EXACTLY, but seriously EXACTLY what he wanted, and how to do it, and so it all came together so passionately, and profoundly too. 

It's really not to be taken for granted that we got such a mature, serious, and dark Wolverine movie.

It needed the R movie not for the curse words, the gore, or that brief boob flash, but for the darkness of the story.

To be honest, it made me feel uneasy, and I'm a fan of dark stories. I like it when people have a vision to make something ""fucked up"" and to not suger coat it.

I just wasn't expecting it from this.

I was expecting some scenes to get me in the ""feels"", but not to the extent this movie reached. Truly difficult stuff, I really mean this. 

Everything from Charles dying just after pouring his heart out, or the way Logan ran to him, him freaking out and nearly breaking down when he buried him..

Or generally the whole premise, both of them being old, broken men, who did so much good in this world only to eat so much badness.

To summarize what makes this movie so good in my opinion, let's talk about the final shot. Laura turning the cross into an X, and Logan.. staying dead. No final surprises. Takes a whole bunch of balls to do that, even considering Jackman left the role. They could have taken an alternative road, or maybe left it a little open for the sake of optimism, but no, they kept it pure dark, to the end.

Logan died happy, saying ""This is what it feels like"" (which totally destroyed me as well, btw), but all in all he had a terrible life with a bad ending, losing Charles. But Laura guided him, so at least he had some bliss.

Point is, fantastic movie.

I'm more of a DC guy, and BVS has been my favorite CBM for a while, but Logan has now taken the throne. Terrific stuff, really.

[Logan](https://tldrmoviereviews.com/2017/03/03/movie-review-logan/) is (well for me) the best film in the franchise by a country mile, the characters were relatable, the action was intense, the story was well structured, the pacing was just right, and it had emotional weight.

The action also felt contextual, and never gratuitous, so it makes the most out of the R rating without being defined by it. This is important because the R rating is not just an excuse, it is needed to tell the story they wanted to tell.

dezzw2z,"This movie took me to unexpected places. There were several moments when the dynamic between Logan and Xavier very much reminded me of me and my old man toward his end. I would be focused on what makes sense, what is logical, and he would occasionally insist on something, seemingly at random, and it was only later that he said, heartbreakingly, that he just wanted something nice. For example, one day he had his barber come to our house. He was too sick to go out. He didn't exactly need a haircut, and neither did I, so when he offered me to sit down next to him and get a haircut too, I said I didn't need one, I didn't want to impose and make the sweet old lady cut another head of hair, she was doing this on her own time. Really though, I was struggling mightily with my dad's sudden downturn, so I went up to my room. When I saw my dad later, he looked hollowed out. He apologized — for what, I don't know. He said that we went to the barber together for my first haircut, and he had his hair cut in the chair next to me; he wanted me to share in his last haircut. A father-son thing coming full circle. Just a pretty little moment that meant more than a haircut should. I was so logical and cold and intent on keeping all that horrible shit at arm's length that it never occurred to me that there was the potential and need for something beautiful.

I saw my father in Xavier when he stopped everyone on the highway so he could calm those horses, or when he talked about just having that one nice dinner in a loving home. Simple things you are rarely conscious of cherishing until very special times in your life, frequently at the end of it.

I zoned out several times in the theater. I receded into memories of my dying father, and of my dying mother, what they said and did in their final weeks. They would be pissed off that they were in pain and couldn't even use the bathroom like a normal person. They were endlessly apologetic. But then they'd occasionally be stubborn, and I'd be so emotionally spent that I had a hard time dealing with special requests. I couldn't quite wrap my head around them. I wasn't on the run from lethal forces of evil, so I indulged them without a problem (such as suddenly being asked to take a wrong turn so that we could go the long way home... on a very pretty road through a forest... ""Oh, and over there, isn't that where that 5th grade friend of yours lived?""), but it would take me a bit too long to appreciate what they actually wanted: just something _nice_. 

Oh, and what was my dad's favorite movie? 

It was Shane. He quoted it often.
",5x7z96
defzqhl,"I watched Logan 24 hours ago. I have so many thoughts and questions.


* Does Wolverine admitting to killing Xander Rice’s father officially put this in the “Apocalypse Timeline”?

* How old is X-24? Surely if he is a clone like Laura, he too had to grow up? Because he looks like Wolverine when he was at least 30. But, he was made after Laura, because she is X-23…?

* No post-credit scene seemed nice. It keeps us just talking and buzzing about “Logan”, rather than buzzing about a teaser for the next movie. Although people seem to be talking about the lack of post-credit scene, so it’s a moo point.

* I think people are going to get confused when the New Mutants movie gets made and none of the kids at Eden are in it. Prof. X mentioned the words “new mutants” several times during his plea to Logan about the telepathy with other mutants.

* I wish Gabriella were named Sarah. Also, have it hinted that Laura was forced to murder her at the hotel too. It would’ve been a nice touch. 

* Did Prof. X kill the last remaining X-Men or did Wolverine? ^^^I ^^^feel ^^^I ^^^missed ^^^something

* I think the samurai sword on the wall hinted that Logan did end up in Japan, despite DOFP. Again referencing the “ripple effect” Beast mentions in previous films. 

* Were those comics in the movie real?

* I liked the adamantium bullet. I thought it was a nice way to reference Origins in Logan. 

* I was ready for the rock to move a little at the end. Nope. He was really dead. ;(

* The only thing that can kill Wolverine is Wolverine. Well he did want to kill himself, after all.

During the film I kept thinking to myself ""I can't believe this came out of the studio system"". It feels like the ultimate fan-film for Wolverine. One in which dark themes are discussed - mortality, regret, being different from others. And it's a film with real consequences for all involved. It just won't be the same seeing an X-MEN film with the heroes in spandex and escaping from impossible odds. 

Although the violence was visceral, I found the story and the way the main themes were handled very subtle, and quite beautiful. Nothing was over-exposed via dialogue or flashbacks. The film just starts without a VO, carefully explains past events in subtle (and minor) dialogue, and slowly builds the internal conflict/relationship between Logan and his daughter.

Not like Deadpool, with its over the top meme-like siliness, but an emotionally driven, self-contained personal drama with small scale action. The whole world is not at stake. There is no CG destruction. Instead, this is a stand-alone movie that’s not concerned with any larger universe or previous movies or any  franchise baggage. It’s just Logan, Charles and Laura against some bad guys. Dirty, ugly, gritty, tense, superbly acted and realistically violent. Simply put, the movie does not fuck around.

I feel like this is going to be John Goodman in 10 Cloverfield Lane all over again however, Hugh Jackman NEEDS an Oscar nomination for this. He brought so much nuance and emotion to a superhero character on a level that is really unprecedented. Dafne Keen was phenomenal and would love to see her take up the 'wolverine' mantelpiece but I say give it a couple of years first. Let us mourn Hugh :(

Probably my favourite superhero movie since The Dark Knight, which is saying something as I've pretty much loved all the ones since.

Also, can we get an AMEN to R-Rated action movies making a comeback. John Wick 1/2, Deadpool and now this. It's not just us cinemagoers having a bloodlust. It helps bring so much more tension, emotion and a real sense of urgency to scenes.",5x7z96

dek6bs9,"I was really rocked by how they handled Logan's death. Usually when a pivotal hero dies, he tells his successor ""protect the people, it's all worth it, we did it together, etc"" and dies after proving his heroism one last time and all that stuff.

But here, Logan doesn't have any moving speech to give. He doesn't go down after defeating the imposter and proving himself as the true wolverine or whatever. He gets mauled by X-24, writhes in agony with a branch through his chest, and then he just *dies*. 

And he doesn't even seem sad about it, like he's just done and ready to go. In my book, having Logan, a guy who's supposed to be unkillable, just flat out die from his wounds carries so much more weight.

Interesting point to be made though: In 2013's The Wolverine, [the mutant who can see people's deaths tells Logan not to operate on himself, because she see's that he'll die lying on his back, covered in blood, holding his heart in his hand.

He's lying on his back, covered in blood, and holding his daughter's hand.](#spoiler) Foreshadowing much?",5x7z96
deg9xep,"Holy fuck. Holy fucking fuck. I can't even put everything that's spinning through my head into words right now. Granted; I might be a biased audience. I was 6 years old when the first X Men movie came out, so I was about their target demographic at the time (this is obviously not a kid's movie anymore lol). The X Men were also my favorite body of work put out by Marvel, so again I'm probably biased here lol. I used to daydream about being a mutant as a kid, so in a way I kind of grew up with this franchise and these actors. He probably hates this; but Hugh Jackman will forever be Wolverine to me haha. There couldn't be a more perfect actor imo. Now I can't lie; as I grew older I realized the X Men movies weren't as magical to me as they were when I was a kid. I saw their gimmicky CGI and forced humor. I saw them for the cookie cutter superhero movies that they are (save for a few moments here and there throughout the franchise). Yet I always had a soft spot for them in my heart. The X Men were also the *only* comic book I read as a kid. Suffice to say, seeing this was like reliving my first love. I remembered why I loved her (the series, wolverine, etc.). I remembered why we broke up. Lol this movie is a god damned emotional rollercoaster that pulls at your heart's strings and I love it for that.

The fucking icing on the cake is the R rating. They don't fuck around with it here. Instead of just adding blood, titties, and swearing to attract viewers (well okay they *did* add all that but still lol), they take full advantage to use that rating to tell a deeper character driven story. All cliches aside; this is the most *human* mutant movie ever made. I will go as far as to say that this is the best Marvel movie ever made too.

This is the Wolverine movie we've all been waiting for. We just wanted to see him go berserk and rip people's heads off and we got that. He's not as agile as he once was; so the action is lacking in the dexterous sense. However what it lacks in agility and beauty, it makes up in raw, unadulterated emotion. It's like you can feel all of Logan's rage and pain with every slice he cuts into his enemies. He's just fucking visceral throughout the whole movie.

It's like an anti-superhero movie. We're so used to Logan being this invincible god, so accustomed to Charles being this infallible, ""calm in the eye of the storm"" type leader. But here we see their powers taking their toll on their bodies. Charles is a seizure away from being a babbling old man riddled with dementia. He's stubborn and won't take his medication. He spews nonsense; yet at the same time his core is still there. He still has these spare moments of wisdom. And Logan is just visibly broken down; both physically and mentally. Jackman does a *fantastic* job of portraying the pain he is feeling. 

I mean this movie just blew me away. I feel like I've only wrote a sliver of what I want to say about it lol; this will be on my mind for weeks to come.

Everyone was fantastic in this movie, especially X23 AKA Laura. A bad child actor/actress can really ruin the immersion, but she put on just as good as a performance as Hugh and Patrick did. When she finally breaks down and says, ""daddy"" I fucking lost it man. Not even going to lie, on the drive back I started crying thinking about the movie, thinking about how it was the last X Men movie I'll see of my generation. 

I also love how in a way we see this movie through Laura's eyes. She watches Logan and Charles bicker and argue with each other in a father/son way; that we never really got to see before. She grew up reading the comics like we did; idolizing people like Wolverine and Professor X. Yet when Logan says it was all a bunch of bullshit and lies; it's almost like he's telling the audience, ""don't expect this to be like the comics. This isn't that at all. There is no ride off into the sunset at the end of this story."" 

I usually love sad endings; especially in a genre you don't expect them. But god fucking damn I was just wishing that Logan would burst through those stones in the last scene lol. I didn't want to see him go. Especially after all the character growth we get to see in this movie. And that last shot was fucking *perfect.* God I just love this movie so much. It was everything I hoped it to be. A wonderful send off for both Jackman and Stewart. 

Side note: I couldn't stay around for the after credits scene; was it worth staying for?

Side side note: Although I didn't think about it during the movie just because it was so intense that I was held captivated throughout, but I can't help but wonder; where were the rest of the mutants? Are we to just assume that they are all dead now? I know that this movie didn't stay canon to the comic books (in fact it quite outright said ""fuck the comic books"" lmao), but I wish there was a little more detail as to why it was only Charles and Logan left.

All in all I just wanna end by reiterating that this is the best Marvel movie ever made. In my opinion at least. I left feeling hollow and depressed and angry; and for those reasons I want to hate it but I can't. This movie told a real story and didn't hold any punches back, it didn't apologize for anything. And I love that about it. A real refreshing addition to a genre that was quickly becoming stale. Can't wait to see it again.

I'm still a bit sketchy on the Adamantium poisoning that was killing Logan, seemed a bit forced (granted, I have not read any comics, so I don't know if that is an actual thing they did to him or not). Does that mean that X-23 is going to have the same happen to her in the future?",5x7z96

It's more like a modern western, if anything. 

The way they depicted Logan was just so new and engrossing, because untill this movie we always saw him like this unbreakable, rarely vulnerable, beast-like, bad ass man, while in this movie he's so devastated and heartbroken.

Besides, to watch the powerful, elegant and classy Professor X as a sick, bitter yet hopeful old man was so interesting. They completely deconstructed the characters.

The action scenes were absolutely amazing because this time Logan is vulnerable. As a result, you really fear for him, and cheer like crazy whenever he fights. The X-23 was astounding.

However, it wasn't the action sequences that made this movie so great, though they were pretty awesome, it was the focus on character, on the the story.

Near the end when the kids fight back...oh man that was the BEST.  I'm very happy they did that because it allowed me to believe that these kids absolutely had to fight. They weren't helpless and they were in a corner. Rightly outnumbered and literally outgunned. I expected Logan to do his thing, sure but the kids needed to fight in order for me to believe this.

That along with the absolutely amazing emotional aspect of the movie was just shattering. Seeing a near broken man find a new purpose for his final days. Having lived through a century's worth of conflict, Nobody has suffered more pain of loss than Logan has. seeing his smile when he was eating dinner with the family that had invited them in, the death of Professor X, and finally the death of our beloved protagonist himself. While I came close to tears, the final nail in the coffin for me was when Laura picked up the cross marking his grave and repositioned it in the form of an X. For Wolverine the X-Men might just have been a chapter in his life, but for Laura it meant much more. In her eyes it's what defines her father and all other mutants. They're the inspiration for every kid who escaped from Mexico and the greatest experience they will ever have is knowing who the Wolverine was. He isn't a cold blooded killer. He's a hero. No matter what Logan has done, he will always be her/their hero.

Hugh fucking Jackman though. Give that man a nomination at least. He knocked it out the park. When he picked Xavier up after he got stabbed by x-24 and whispered ""it wasn't me"" that broke me. I feel the whole movie is Logan trying to prove himself, but everything is too late for him. ",5x7z96

Previously the pg13 xmen movies showed Wolvie just jumping about and slashing but because you don't see the gore, it looked like he was just doimg super hard punching or at most doing some light cutting. He didn't look that badass. 

But in this movie, through old man Logan, you feel how helpless he felt fighting X-24, and the viscerality showed how helpless Logan's foes must've have felt when having to face Logan in his prime when he was fast and unstoppable and in a berserker rage.

dfewtvu,"I've been seeing some criticism elsewhere about the final shot. Screen Rant even did a whole write up about how it betrays the rest of the movie when Laura turns the cross over to an X. 


I just don't see a more fitting ending though. Especially with what Logan tells Laura about how she doesn't have to be what she (or more accurately...they) were designed for. It's foreshadowed even earlier when Rice is trying to convince Caliban to give in and help him, and Rice says that Laura is not what nature intended.
The same applies to Logan. Even as a naturally born mutant, he was modified into a man-made animal. Even in saving Laura and the other kids, he defied nature by using the serum to become a killing machine again. At least in Laura's eyes, Logan's life can be summarized as being Weapon X. And she's shifting focus away from the end of his journey to the beginning of her own. The movie almost would have been incomplete without the turning gesture. It's the small glimmer of hope we can take away from a gut wrenching finale.


Given those scenes, it comes off as cheap to dismiss Laura turning the cross as some random thing. It's barely even subtext. It's a literal crossroads for her. Does she emulate the life of her father, and become another living weapon who wanders somewhat aimlessly into more scenes of violence? Or does it mean that she is free to live her life as she wants, as Logan intended for her?


It's a shame that Fox will inevitably answer the question for us (this movie made how much money, again?) with some future installment of X-23. Even if it's great, the ambiguity of what life Laura might go on to live is absolutely beautiful. And yeah, she's already done a lot of killing that she'll  likely have to resume at some point, especially with her quoting Shane during the eulogy. But maybe she finds atonement by forming Eden with the other kids, and gets to experience what Logan could not until the very end. It could go either way.

The actual progression of events is very derivative  however they are executed well.

The film never goes full bore into what it clearly wants to be, but has enough scenes that buck convention for this type of film that it stands out. 

Highlights would be:

- the farm sequence

- the shot where they're leaving the farm in the corn. 

- a decent amount of information is *actually left to the subtext* about corn and Charles and all kinds of stuff.

- the beard cutting sequence 

- the closing shot composition

deupxzw,"I bought the first 6 X-Men movies in a blu-ray pack a couple years ago and never bothered to watch them.  I finally got around to it last April-May or so.  Watch all 6 over about a month and then eventually bought DoFP and Apocalypse to catch up.  I'm so glad that I got into them at the last minute so I could see this in theaters.

I'm happy with how they broke away from so many superhero movies of today:

* The world was never going to come to an end.
* There's no questioning if the hero was still alive through some distant hope.
* No overabundance of heroes and villains.

di8y3l1,"I watched Logan 30 minutes ago, and it is by far the best superhero movie I've ever seen. Not that anyone cares, but I care.

I can't begin to express what I loved about watching it. This film was just real, and down-to-earth. It blatantly attacked its own genre; it went meta as hell with the whole comic book thing. It became incredibly visceral in the part when Charles tells Logan that it is real for Laura. Also very visceral around Charles's whole dementia thing, and his death. And Logan's death. It just becomes real - people die. (RIP Merchant guy too :(.) Plus the fucking family. The dude that lent Laura his music swiftly dies in a horrible manner... Life is just portrayed as a struggle, and an unwanted depressing pain for Logan who does something heroic he originally doesn't even want to do. That whole journey with him going to sleep in the car... man. 

So nihilistic when Logan basically says it means nothing that Laura is a mutant, and that the whole campaign they are on is pointless. His relationship with Charles and Laura is ""real"", probably because of this form of honesty the film shoves into our face. It is consequently funny when Charles says how the school was for people with special needs etc., and heartbreaking when Laura says that she'll be fine after Logan declares that the people he cares about die. Fuck dude...

I amend my original comment. This is the best film I have ever seen, not that it means anything. It touched me profoundly, and made me cry. And I have not cried in a long, long time.

dji2xrf,"I just saw this, after I talked with my best friend about it last week.  We both loved Wolverine so much when we were kids.  We grew up in this small town back in the days before the Internet, when the only way to get comics was whatever was sold at the grocery store, and X-Men was probably the best thing they had...they even had the Wolverine comics a lot, and it's kind of childhood memory.  I knew this movie was going to be dark, from the trailers.  I put off seeing it because I haven't been in the best spot, mentally, emotionally, recently.  But my friend's dad just died a few weeks ago, and he told me I should see it.  I'm glad I did.  It was sad.  Tough to watch.  I grew up with this character, and Jackman's portrayal was pretty much perfect.  He might even show up again in another movie, that's not impossible, it's Hollywood of course.  As far as I'm concerned though, this is the end of the character.  It just kind of feels right.

It makes sense, I guess, that a lot of these things from when I was a kid - like Transformers, for example - are getting big movies made.  They're marketable.  But usually they go for a vibe that will bring in the kids...this one had an R rating, and it was obvious that it was going to be pretty raw.  I just wasn't really ready to see Logan and Charles die, although I guess I should have been.  It broke me up a little bit.  I'm not really sure what else to say.  I know it's been out for a long time so it's not likely anyone will see this, and it's not like anyone who hasn't seen the movie would be convinced to by it - especially since I gave away two plot points (but other posts did as well, so...whatever) - but I kind of felt like this was in some way...

Like saying goodbye to a part of my youth.  I'm getting old now.  The people and things I love are going away, I know that and I know it's part of life.  It doesn't feel bad.  But it does...feel.  I don't know how else to say it.  It was a good end.",5x7z96

dep00f5,"This movie was fantastic. All the comicbook stuff usualy front and center in these genre flicks is merely a catalyst to explore a broken man with a history of violence and pain. The stuff about a Mexican mutant-experiment program, the mercenaries, the doctor, and the X24 were all basically ghosts that represented Logan's past come back to haunt him. To Logan, it was all that he was, despite his best intentions or desires.

I mean, I think Logan could have put two and two together after watching Gabriella's recording that the *thing* that replaced the X23 program was the X24. So, those kids were created, lived a miserable short existence, and up until we saw them, were probably dead for all anybody knew. And that was because of what Logan was, even after all that time and after all the running. Logan saw all those other mutants die, yet the horrors that destroyed his life for so long still lingered. Just another twist of the knife.

That's why I really liked that Laura killed the X24 with the bullet Logan kept to put himself out. That bullet was meant for *The Wolverine*; that bullet was his fate. Logan, at the beginning of this flick, was indivisible, in his mind, from that wrathful beast, good for nothing but killing. Nothing but a weapon. So Laura enters his life, and she facilitates his apotheosis. He is able to divide himself from that legacy of bloodshed and broken bodies. 

The moment after the X-24 slumps over, Logan can finally *feel* what's truly good about life. He sees Laura for what she is. She, in a quite literal act, puts down everything bad about Logan and lets him live on as something that could be better than what he was.

[Don't look] Wolverine is old, creaky, and just wants to die. Professor X is senile. They live in squalor, knowing their kind are becoming extinct. All their battles over the years were futile. Triumphs of previous movies accomplished nothing in the end. I guess all the other mutants died, though to be honest they've hopped between timelines so often in these movies that I don't know how it's supposed to have happened. 

Then they find out there's a new generation of mutant kids, and they try to help. Prof X gets killed. Several nice people who try to help them along the way get massacred. Logan dies. The kids do get away, supposedly to safety, but we don't see it. 

The end. 

I don't mean to say that Logan was a bad movie. It was actually very well-made, frequently moving, and I appreciate that they tried to do something different with the X-Men franchise, which was becoming stale and repetitive. But that different thing was a relentlessly downbeat story in which characters I like reach the end of their lives in lingering illness and failure. (#spoiler)

dehi6sy,"I heard the critics raving about this film but I didn't expect it to be so damn good!

Fantastic in just about every regard, with special mention to the central characters, who are all so heartfelt. It hurts to see Xavier getting senile and Wolverine getting old. It hurts to see a jaded and cynical Logan being, let's face it, a terrible father. This film hurts in all the right ways.

I think Dafne Keen's performance deserves special mention. Not only is she one of the few examples of a *good* child actor, but this is her first film! I'm really hoping we get to see more of her in future instalments.

Stephen Merchant also puts in a good performance, which surprised me a little. After his voice performance in Portal 2 I knew he could act, but his character in Logan has to strike a careful balance between sassy, vulnerable, and eventually unexpectedly heroic - he pulls it off well.

And it goes without saying that Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are incredible in their final contributions to the franchise. It feels like both characters know, deep down, that this road trip will end both of them. They have a familiarity that swings between true companions and old married couple and it's charming at its lightest and heartbreaking at its bleakest.

dehhk6y,"I think this is a great movie. One of the best X-men films certainly. Jackman and Stewart give legitimately good performances, no need for a qualifier to that. I liked that they dug into the R rating. X-23 was awesome too, and that actress was perfectly cast. 

It needed a better villain though. X-24 could have been another Wolverine villain like Omega Red, Cyber, or even Sabertooth. It would have done well to mix up the action a lot more having a different type of mutant in there. The action is all very well directed but at the end the effectiveness of seeing Wolverine chop people up was kind of lost, and that is something I'd never thought I'd say. It was cool to see the other mutant kids use their powers in awesome and gruesome ways though. I just think that having another villain in there would have been good to escalate the action a bit. However I understand that The Wolverine got a lot of shit for the final fight scene with the Silver Samurai so I get why they were likely avoiding that.

Overall though this movie is very effective emotionally. I've never heard a theater more silent than with that ending scene. Take note reddit, *this* is how you earn a death to a character like this. They earned killing off Charles and Logan. I always see shit about how Marvel needs to kill off more characters, but the fact is they don't because they haven't earned that yet. They haven't really put their heroes through the ringer yet to make their deaths be effective as this. I mean Superman's death in BVS was one of the least effective and least earned deaths I've ever seen in a movie. And I am glad that Marvel has avoided it thus far because IMO it does actually take 17 years of a character to make that death *truly* meaningful. Was Cyclops or Jean dying in X-men 3 really that effective? To me it really wasn't. This movie though, after all of this time make it really hit home in a truly beautiful and effective way. 

On a further note it has been 17 years we have had Jackman as Wolverine and he was awesome in all of it, even in the lesser films he is still amazing in the part. You can tell that he always gave this part his all. He was never half assing it, I mean how much he built himself up physically is pretty astounding and show the tremendous effort he put into doing this. Also hearing the stories about how he wanted to make this R because he knew the fans really wanted to see that and even took a paycut to ensure an R rating *for the fans* shows that he has respect for the fanbase.

Logan has always been edgy, so it's no surprise that he would open with an f-bomb. It was perfect in an almost expected way. Xavier, on the other-hand, was introduced quite non-conventionally; suffering neurodegenerative disorder, dropping expletives right and left. Reminiscent of the introduction to McAvoy's Xavier in DOFP, but somewhat ""out-of-character"" for Stewart's wiser, more contained Xavier. 

Yet, he attests that Logan has become someone completely unrecognizable. Initially, we, as the viewer, can only perceive that difference through Logan's affect on Charles. Along with the disease, you get a sense that Logan's grim cynicism has also altered his state of being over time.

This concept of a depleted mutant universe was simply too sad, and these versions of Charles and Logan felt so disconnected and unrecognizable from their usual versions, that it mostly felt like a real life drama.


**Some random points:**

* Beautiful settings; very atmospheric, lovely camera work. 

* Charles was mostly a pointless character. Yes I am sorry and I endlessly adore P.S., but he wasn't really necessary to drive the plot. 

* Why were there suddenly no new mutants in the world? I don't need everything explained, but this seems to be a major plot point.

* The endless back and forth between Charles and Logan should have been avoided. I get that Charles has always been a guiding angel for Logan, but at some point he has to let go.

* Dafne Keen as Laura was for me an odd choice, as I would have expected someone a few years older. She certainly performed well with the setup she was given, but the whole no-speaking-only-grunting was quite annoying. The character could clearly both think and speak, so it made little sense to keep her mute for 90 minutes.

* The bad guys were standard 1-dimensional caricatures. The evil doctor, the evil henchman and a random number of meatbags to be slaughtered.

* The fight scenes were sublime. It was a thrill to finally see Logan and Laura go bananas with those claws. It was everything I had hoped it would be.

* The Terminator Logan was a cheap fight mechanism.

* Gabriela was useless. She could have just bought a new car like Logan did, and driven Laura to where ever she needed to go. Getting Logan involved was pointless. The bad guys were only able to find Logan on account of Caliban. She could easily have escaped.

I think a tighter story would have been better. Have Caliban be the one smuggling Laura out of the Evil Factory of Doom, and subsequently sniffing Logan out. Caliban could have been injured during the escape and dying shortly after, and thus given Logan the responsibility of getting Laura to safety. And Logan should have been far more willing to do this at his own accord. The image of the lonesome anti-hero is fine, but it was taken too far for most of this film (especially at the kidnapping scene in the house). And Laura should have been a few years older to make her more realistic and far more vocal. Then it would just have been the 2 of them, making their way across country.


The guys chasing them should have been government sanctioned agents and idealists. They could have referenced the horrors that mutants had inflected on the world, and cloaked them in a shroud of justice. Let them believe they are the good guys and let them have valid perspectives. The people who then created Laura could have been someone else entirely - possible a group the agents shut down, but managed to let Laura escape in the process.",5x7z96

**1.)** if x-men origins: wolverine took place in the year it came out in (2009) then it can be assumed that that is when stryker took his DNA, which would also explain laura's ~8 year old age. might be a stretch but i thought it was cool to think about.

**2.** the fight scenes were *amazing.* some of the best action sequences i have ever seen in a movie. they were just long enough, thrilling, and spread evenly across the movie. also, the choreographer for the fight scenes deserves an award IMO.

**3.)** [i thought it was really cool how logan's hair even turned back to brown for a bit after he took the medicine](#spoiler)

**4.)** [i was genuinely surprised by how charles died. i did not expect that one bit and i was actually impressed as to how x-24 came in without feeling too forced - and his existence made total sense too. loved that whole scene.](#spoiler)

**5.)** [logan's last words - ""so this is what it feels like"" - had multiple meanings to me. i think he was talking not only of dying, but of how it felt to have a family; a daughter. he had never really dealt with that sort of thing before and it was touching to see him vulnerable in that way.](#spoiler)

**6.)** LOVE LOVE LOVE dafne keen and how badass she is. [body count probably higher than logan.](#spoiler)

**7.)** the gore. my god, am i glad this was R. it finally did wolverine true movie justice. 

i'm not a very harsh critic, so that might have something to do with it, but this is easily one of my favorite movies. i really hope it gets considered for an oscar because i thought this was amazing.

The fact that Professor X, Logan, and the entirety of the X-men's efforts have proven pointless.

dev741p,"I don't think I've ever seen a larger group of mooks casually throwing away their lives than in Logan. Almost every fight scene was a bunch of ex military guys getting slaughtered by someone they had almost no hope of even damaging.

I guess in movie bad guy school they didn't teach that guns don't require you to huddle two feet around your target. You'd think they would try and stay away from the guy with sharp metal claws that's almost impervious to bullets. Nope, let's all just charge into the meat grinder that killed the other half of our unit. They might as well have made all the mercs into robots, because that's how much concern they had for their own lives.

It's kind of funny too, because mercs are historically and contemporarily the very last troops you would expect to blindly die for someone.

dhnxzw8,"Was anybody else disappointed with the build up  and portrayal of X24's character? 

I mean, he was built up as a younger, prime Logan and it did not seem like that at all. He did not even stomp a half dead Logan; while Laura was giving him trouble. Not to mention how weak his healing factor was in comparison to Logan's in his prime. Stryker shot Logan multiple times with adamantium bullets, including two point blank head-shots, all it did to prime Wolvie was knock him unconscious and make him lose his memory.. while one bullet to X24 completely shattered his skull. It's an insult to call this Logan in his prime, who survived Nagasaki and a confrontation with a level 5 mutant (Jean Grey) 

I would have preferred Liev Schreiber reprise his role as Sabretooth. He was one of the only excellent things about the Origins movie, his story wasn't very clear after that. I believe it would have been a fitting end to have both characters end each other, just as they started together.

The scene around the dinner table put a massive smile on my face, just as Xavier's recollection of the Westchester incident brought tears to my eyes. Also thought Dafne Keen gave a great performance.

This movie was a 9.5/10 for me. Its like they took Wolverine and ""Kill Billed"" it. This is the only true representation that, I assume, the original creator of Wolverine as a character intended and who I always assumed he was. A cussing, drinking, selfish dude that just wanted to be left alone who would shove his claws into your brain if you fucked with him. They got his pained rage down perfectly. 

His relationship with Charles was so perfect to me. Charles has always been a father figure to Logan and as someone posted earlier, this exactly represented their relationship with their dying father. The hotel scene is one of the most intense pieces of film I have ever watched (I was watching in a Dolby Theater and my seat was shaking that whole scene). I must have muttered holy shit to myself like 10 times during that scene. 

I havent read comic books in 20 years so I had no idea that X-23 even existed so her coming out of that warehouse and rolling that head was a WTF moment for me. Then out come the claws and I was so fucking psyched. I didnt know how badly I needed a little girl Wolverine in my life. That chick nailed the rage as well. 

The cinematography was superb. It was dark and moody and felt like an old western to me. Or like Shoguns Assassin.  This whole movie felt like it was the final scene in the Jackman/Wolverine story and some have said they didnt like the ending. I knew going in that Wolverine was going to die so to me, the whole movie IS the ending. There were a couple of small plot holes that I caught but they were drowned out by awesomeness to me and I let them go right away. Perfect send off to me and now I have the whole X-23 story to engross myself with. I'll be seeing this move at least once more in the theater and will buy it whenever it becomes available.",5x7z96

Like they had the exact same fucking reason to exist (other than to piss the fuck out of everyone in the case of Origins.) That cabin thing where the young mutants were hiding out reminded me a lot of Logan's house in Origins (the one in which he stayed with mind control and fucking stupid story extraordinaire chick).

This was everything promised by the excellent trailers and more.  I hated Origins and The Wolverine and I am so glad I did not let that put me off giving this one a shot.

The performances by Jackman and Stewart are perhaps my favorite from these two (I wasn't a big fan of Hugh Jackman but he really knocked this performance out of the park).  I really felt the vulnerability of the characters, every nuance sold the idea Wolverine and Prof. X are rapidly breaking down.

The writing and direction were also top notch.  The exposition was fed in drips rather than getting dumped on the audience, the quiet moments didn't drag the film down as they were used to build the characters in a natural way.

Even more amazing for me is that this movie even got me close to tears a couple of times.  I very rarely get emotional in a movie, usually the drama just makes me roll my eyes and count off the numerous movies in which the same scene plays out with the same dialogue.

I know I'll get ridiculed for the next statement, but I don't care.  I would not be disappointed if this movie garnered awards consideration.  If you took out the science fiction elements of this movie this is exactly the sort of film voters would normally fall over themselves to recognise.

This may also tick a few people off, but for mine, this is by far the best movie to come from the X-Men franchise.

dej5eo0,"So I think that All of the other x men movies were only comics in the LOGAN world. This would be such an amazing way to resolve all continuity errors in the whole damn franchise. 

Remember Logan tells Laura that only a 1/4 of the comics she read actually happened and that it didn't even happen like the comics depicted. So I kinda think that includes all the previous movies. This is also the first time the films work ""feels"" real. The gore, the depression, the adiction, the senile old man, the real conversations. All of it creates a sense of authenticity. All the previous films now seem like mere caricatures of the real worl. The worldof LOGAN. 

The previous films were made to make money off of people who cherished the comics. This was done well but you have to admit that the films very obviously ""feel"" like movies of comics. LOGAN feels like the last days of a real man who had super powers in a real world. 

I think even the title supports my theory. The film was directed by the same man whole directed origins and the wolverine. The titles of the last movies and very comic book sounding. The a sensationalist, they describe a movie about comic book characters. On the other hand Logan describe the man sensationalized in the previous films. 

I could keep going... On mobile sorry for any errors. Let me know what you think",5x7z96
dejolsz,"A lot of people hate that they used X-24 as the big bad but I personally think it was a good decision. 

1. Comic book movies usually have the main boss be someone with similar powers to the hero except better and the hero somehow overcomes that for example iron man vs. iron monger, Captain America vs. Winter Soldier, Wolverine vs. Sabertooth.

Once they decided that the big bad would be someone with similar powers, it wouldn't make sense to just force Sabertooth back into the equation. From the point of the movie, they were all old and didn't give a shit anymore. Sabertooth would have no motive to go after Wolverine after almost 200 years. X-24 was just a killing machine who didn't know any better. He didn't need a motive because he wasn't intelligent. He was feral and either listened to his creator or just functions off his reactions. We see in the farm house scene he walked past Logan with no regard for him because his creator told him to get X-23 and kill anyone in the way. Logan just let him go so X-24 didn't bother with him. However, he's reactive when those hooligans caused him trouble outside the farm, he just demolished them without any command from his creator. He survives off orders or reaction. Doesn't need a motive.

2. Throughout the Xmen films a common theme was Wolverines suffering. He always suffered and made big sacrifices and it was always for nothing because in the end all the mutants die. He loves someone and they die or he has to kill them. It's all about Wolverines suffering emotionally or physically. Logan said he can't sleep at night because he has nightmares of hurting people. He regrets all the violence hes caused. In the wolverine he stays in the forest alone to get away from the violence. He doesn't want to be a killing machine like the Weapon X program wanted him to be. So he's suffering to maintain his humanity. We see with X-24 what he would be like if he just accepted his feral instinct and didn't suffer to fight that and maintain his humanity. It basically just said that if Logan didn't suffer, and have regrets, he would be X-24. ",5x7z96

Logan is different though - it's a sucker punch you're not expecting, and I walked out of the movie with a strange, alien lump in my throat and an inability to sleep properly last night just thinking about the movie and mulling over the entire thing bit by bit. 

And I wouldn't even have considered myself a huge X-Men/Wolverine fan in general - more just a casual consumer of the franchise!

Seeing him and helping care for him in his weakened state, being reminded of his age and seeing the frailty and degradation of someone you lionize as child, those scenes all brought that up(and yes that also references Stewart's fatherly role in both TNG and the first X-men movies). Maybe seeing this movie so close to these events makes it feel more powerful, but shit, Patrick Stewart needs a fucking Oscar.

One of the most difficult scenes was where Stewart was watching that Western movie with Laura. My mother passed away from cancer a few years ago. During her final bedridden days, I spent a lot of time sitting with her while she watched old movies on TCM, movies she grew up watching. Stewart's expression and voice describing watching that film reminded me a lot of how my mom saw those movies in her final days.

It's weird that a movie and series with such out there scenes(cyborg commandos anyone?) can also draw out such raw emotion.. or maybe I have terrible taste in movies.",5x7z96

-More gritty superhero movies incoming?       ",5x7z96

I'm a Marvel Studios fan and enjoyed the older X-Men and DOFP... but lowered my expectations for this because of the terrible Wolverine films prior to it.... but Logan delivers..

Logan and Deadpool... easily top 2 films from Fox that has super hero characters in it. Both very violent and R rated....

di7d155,"Just watched it. I am unclear about the details of the Westchester incident. 

According to the radio comment, it happened just one year prior to the events of the movie. That would mean that Logan should have been leading a normal, happy life until just a year ago. The movie made it seem that he had been a bitter recluse for many years, and that Charles was sick for a long time. At the time of the incident, they were all at the mansion so Charles must have been in sound health just one year prior? 

Secondly, only 7 mutants were killed in Westchester. What happened to all the other people living in the X-men mansion? The corn modification just prevented new mutants from being born, but what killed them off?

And lastly, isn't it kind of surprising that there was so much research and academia happening in the X-men mansion and no one considered the possible dangers of Charles' powers in case his mind declined, or he comes across some type of disorder or ailment affecting his mental capacity?",5x7z96

dehkw5w,"This is so far beyond any other X-men movies. This is miles past most superhero movies in general. The action doesn't even feel like superhero action, it feels so emotionally charged, and character-driven. The drama feels so genuine, and somehow so understated even when set against the ludicrous violence. I don't like the phrase ""transcends the comic-book genre"" because it implies pulpy mindless nonsense is all a comic book can be. Instead, I'd call this, finally, the first truly accurate portrayal of Wolverine onscreen.

Credit has to be given to Dafne Keen for one of the best child performances I've seen in years. On the level of Milly Bobby Brown's Eleven in terms of nonverbal expression. Not to mention a close match for being scary as all Hell.

Speaking of fear-shit, holy Hell, is this movie cold and brutal. [Xavier's](#spoiler) death is one of the most brutal and heartless death scenes I've ever seen in a superhero movie.

I kinda wish the little girl had more blood splats on her. She was going hack, and slash. And when she went hack&slash. Dear jesus the anger coming from that chick. 

I also like the small details. Like how she started talking after Xavier died, and Logan is shocked she can speak.

But she was speaking to Xavier this whole time. Just she was talking in her mind, and he was speaking out loud. Which is why in the hotel scene, he was telling her info about the movie, and how ""she was right"" when the dudes came in to raid.

10/10. 

also that girl with the nature power or w.e, that exploded that guy with fucking sticks. Then X23 comes in, and fucking bodies the guy about to attack stick girl. My favorite scene. Next to Logan angry slashing Clone Logan.

deio069,"Saw it today just a couple of hours ago.

I want to talk about the Ford Bronco.

I have that Bronco, or rather, I have my Dad's Bronco.  [Here is a pic of me finally getting it back in 2014](http://i.imgur.com/FDW4tqD.jpg).  It went missing for a good 5 or 6 years, due to some bad conduct on the part of a family member, but thanks to my Mom who desired to give it to me for that Christmas, I got it back.  As a baby, she changed my diaper on that Bronco's tailgate.

My Dad disappeared in 2000.  We were very close.  He was pronounced legally deceased in 2007 so that the estate could be settled for my Mother.  For the past 17 years my Sister and I have made various efforts to find him, or rather, his remains .. just anything really to know what happened to him.  He had worked for over 30 years in a very horrible chemical industry, in almost inhuman conditions, breathing chlorine gas and other chemicals, working 80 or more hours a week at times, and then swing shift at that.  This great man, I watched, go down in his last 10 years physically and mentally.  But I grew up with him in that Bronco, in the mountains.

We hunted and camped many places, but one mountain in particular had the history of many generations of the men in our family hunting there.  The night he disappeared I knew that's where he would be, and that's where we found his vehicle.

Over the years, family, friends of my Dad and many great men who, for a living, try to find missing people in the wilderness have gone to that mountain looking for evidence.  None has ever been found.  And I knew it wouldn't be.  If he wanted to never be found then he never would be.

But in the process I have met some incredible men.  One was near retirement, and had looked for missing people for decades.  He had 2 dogs: a cadaver dog and one that could even find bodies in water.  He said when that dog passed he was going to stop doing that type of work.  I asked him why and he said, ""because the last person hefound was an 11 year old girl, and I just don't want to keep doing that type of work.""

But my Dad was an incredible outdoors man.  We spent weeks at a time camping, hiking, hunting.  He taught me to love the wilderness, the mountains.  It is where he wanted to be when not working at work or at home.  He had a tent that was perfect for the Bronco, as you could open the front to form a roof that connected to the back of the Bronco, to the top door of the tailgate.  There he would cook fish and game we got that day.  He would put canvas over the sides if winter and use a gas stove to heat up the tent, the Bronco.  He would pile it to the botton of the side windows with all the supplies we needed.  Prior to my times with him, my Grandfather and my Dad used it.  I was too little, but I have pictures.  Both men army veterans, both drafted, my Grandfather having stormed Normandy beach.

But again, my Dad went downhill, and I watched this man go from someone who could fix anything, build anything, do anything, to a man who couldn't figure out that red went on positive and black on negative when charging a car battery.  His life had been used up by industry.

So then Logan: that green Ford Bronco is just like mine, or rather, my Dad's: white top, forest green body, same front, same rear, same hubcaps, same everything .. even the rust is the same just about.  Of course, as I've mentioned, I got it back a couple of years ago after much struggle, and it nicely is in shelter now in my garage, out of the elements which have hammered it for years.  I've started working on it, but much to go.

The movie is sad, Logan is not good.  He is an alcoholic.  He is very sad.  Besides taking care of Xavier, he has no purpose.  And already I see my Dad in the man.  My Dad even was a huge Johnny Cash fan.  Logan wants to die, and carries around an adamantium bullet to do it.  Johnny Cash's ""Hurt"" that is the theme of the trailer is very relevant.

And the Bronco comes into the movie finally, and the girl, who ends up being his daughter, finally begins speaking.  Logan is older, and when he gets into the driver's seat of the Bronco, I saw my Dad.  I mean, how many times did I witness this same vantage of him getting into that same seat, and yes, I can see my Dad in Jackman/Logan.  Of course, how could I not?

And when they are a bit later in that same Bronco, the girl revealed Professor Xavier had told her a lot that Logan didn't know they had discussed.  And Logan says:""what did the Professor say to you?""  And the little girl says, ""that you want to die.""  And Logan says, ""and what else did he say?""  And she says, ""to not let you..""

I silently lost it.

Part of me feels that I let my Dad die, or I could've stopped it, or I should've done more, said more, realized more.  The one thing about suicide is that the loved ones don't see it coming.  Looking back, all the signs were there with my Dad: bringing me momentous just weeks before, giving me words in cards the year before that show his true meaning.  He took at a long time to plan it, to do it.

Dunno if I should've shared this.

I'm currently working with Namus to find my Dad, from the standpoint of a John Doe whose DNA is hopefully in some Sheriff department's database, and therefore uploaded to the national database.  Namus is under The DOJ.  I have a case worker from there who is great, and seems to care.

Hopefully we can find something, sometime, before me and my family are all passed.

If your read this, Hugh Jackman, thanks.  I haven't been this touched by a movie in, well, ever.

My only issues is that the violence did get a bit gratuitous but I can't blame them since they finally got to use Wolverine as he should be.  My only real gripe was that the 'big baddie' was... Wolverine.  I get the whole old vs young and feeling vs rage theme they were going for but it seemed a little lazy.  Fox must have loved it though, the more Wolverine they can get, the better (at least they seem to think so).

Absolutely blown away by the depth, the resonance, of everyone's acting - Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and especially Dafne Keen just absolutely knocked it out of the park. The R rating enabled this film to really realize its potential, and that ending...the X-grave marker, symbolizing the end of the Wolverine, of the X-Men, of an era...man...

The only thing I would've liked to see more of was more Logan/Laura interaction. I know it was only a week or so, with pretty much every moment extremely stressful, and that active ""bonding"" is in neither character's nature, but imo we saw more of a bond between the Professor and Laura (which makes sense as they were mentally communicating previously). But maybe just an add'l scene or moment, perhaps after the ""Everyone I care about dies""/""So I'll be fine then"" scene (my heart) to give us some hint of Logan's true feelings, that would've made the final scene (""Daddy..."") that much more impactful.

Throughout the movie, we see a Logan deprived of purpose in life, after all that he has lost and been through stuck with the man who made him who he was, Charles Xavier. The story progression was incredible, you actually felt the moral and purpose build by the minute once they met X23. 

It wasn't Logan dying that made me shed a few tears, it was seeing him fighting for the mutants again just like he did in his prime (Origins), basically sacrificing himself; especially for his daughter who thought he didn't give a shit about her.

So is she going to have massive pain from that for the rest of her life or will she just not grow? It is really weird.

di9dn5g,"Man, people get WAY too invested in movies.  The love and the hate, the missed expectations vs self revelations... I side with the lovers here though.  

Look, it's a (super) hero movie; it can't be too innovative, novel, or artistic because it'll stray to far from genre-mandated tropes.  Doesn't mean it can't be a good (which it is) or great movie; but it means people would to themselves a favor to keep their expectations in check.  

Yes, some elements are re-used in un-necessary places, and not every little detail ties out (hint: they don't need to), but you have to admit Logan is a quality flick regardless.  Particularly, I found that the Logan-Xavier relationship is touching, thoughtful, and well executed; and the meta provided nuanced, appropriate narrative on the genre that let the audience toss a few thought-provoking concepts around in-between the attention-grabbing scenes.  

I understand the frustration people have after they pay good money to fend off the advances of repackaged bullshit for two hours.  But just because this wasn't the super hero movie you wanted (or needed) doesn't mean you've been duped by Big Cinema again.  Relax and have some cathartic fun.",5x7z96

Because the emphasis is not so much on established characters (though that would help with the emotional impact at the end), someone new to the franchise or not even an X-Men fan could walk in and see a movie about:

1)A worn-down man in hiding with special abilities that makes him immortal in a world of growing mortality for his kind. 

2) The last bastion of a hopeful future reduced down to a babbling and catastrophic mess. 

3) A young girl who idolizes a fable because she relates to him in almost every way. 

4) A government agency looking to eliminate 2 and 3 for their personal gain.

dekhmon,"In my opinion, this was not an 
""X-Men"" movie. Indicated by the title itself, It is obviously a movie about Logan and his legacy. The thematic elements of the entire movie surrounding his character are glaring. I've found that some parts of the movie that people find fault in are actually carefully placed by the storytellers for the purpose of character study.. For example, many argue that X-24 was a poor choice for a main baddie. With someone as internally conflicted as Logan, how could his last fight be any more perfect than with a mirror image of his former ""unstoppable"" self? It's the will and experience of an old man versus the brutal inexperienced strength of a younger twin. Accompanied by the cunning and naive viciousness of Laura, his ""daughter"", I don't think it could have been a better ending.
   Battle sequences aside, take a look at Logan as a caretaker for Charles..He changes him, wipes his butt probably, nags at him to take his pills, carries him to bed, and what randomly really touched me was when he offered him the remote to watch TV when they were guests at the farm house. Charles' comfort and safety was always at the forefront of Logan's mind. It apparently became his purpose many years ago. His gentle nature towards Charles is really highlighted through Laura's ""keyhole' point of view while watching Logan carry the old man to bed, in my opinion. Really touching..

I could go on and on, and will probably comment more later but these are just a couple examples of why I think this is not an X-Men story but a great character study of a man with fatal flaws. A man, who with all his painful inner conflicts and self destructive behavior manages to rise and fall one last time against his physical and metaphorical self and find purpose in the last dying moments to realize that ""This is what it feels like""

I wonder if it's because she's portrayed as a very strong and capable fighter and slaughters a good number of guys with no issue so I never felt that she was in a huge amount of danger. For a good number of scenes I felt like she takes more care of Logan than he does of her.

dhflo4m,"I loved *most* of this movie but the third act felt so tonally different (and it did not feel like it was a natural progression). Like in The Wolverine, I felt like I watched 2 different films by the end. I was also surprised at how different this was from The Wolverine, especially with Mangold directing both. I feel both were an exercise for him in directing different genres. One drew a lot of influences from Japanese cinema and really embraced the landscape while the other is more of an ode to those classic westerns (like Shane).

I also got a lot of X-men Origins vibes for my liking. It was mainly due to the brainless killing machine in the Clone Wolverine (like Deadpool in Origins) and the whole evil scientist trying to create a super army of mutants. Don't forget the nice family that takes Logan in, only to be killed by said army. Plus, that convoy of jeeps and soldiers chasing them...visually, it was too similar. 

And I know this is not a popular opinion, but I didn't like the little girl's acting by the end. Once she started talking, she kind of lost her luster. Also, her crying was not convincing whatsoever but I'd put that on the director.

Finally, if Logan was more emotionally attached to the group of kids, it would have made for a more dramatic finale. I'd have liked to have seen some parallels brought up between Xavier teaching kids and Logan's potential to do the same, especially now that Xavier is gone. They just needed a scene or 2 where, as they head toward the border, Logan learns how much these kids lack an adult figure who is like them and knows what it's like. It would have finally brought the possibility of having a reason to live. This would also payoff once he died. Throughout his whole life, good situations have been taken away from him, but in this instance he would know that a chance of a better life lives on through Laura.

In a nutshell, this is the Wolverine film we have always wanted to see and the perfect conclusion to his story!


Let’s make something clear. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine has been one of the best things about the X-Men universe and my favourite character of the franchise. Safe to say, I was going into this film with high expectations and knowing that this would be (most probably) the last time we will see him take on the role. His dedication and commitment to playing the role for over 17 years is nothing short of inspiring. This film was the perfect conclusion and send-off to his story and character. Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the best of the Wolverine films and one of the best in the X-Men franchise.
It was brutal, intense, bleak, gritty and dark, highly emotional and gloriously violent!



They really pulled no punches with the action sequences and I was actually shocked by the levels of brutality they pushed it to. They made good use of the R-Rating. Lots of blood, dismemberment and violence and I fucking loved it!


The emotional weight of this film is huge. It’s not like most of the films in it’s genre at all. Felt like a Western at times. It’s extremely grounded, small scale and focuses on the characters and the relationships between them in a way that really pulls at the heart strings. There were a few moments in the film that genuinely had me tearing up a little.



Performance wise, I think this is the best we’ve seen from Jackman and Stewart. The girl that plays X-23 was ace too!! Aesthetically, it was a treat to watch. Looking forward to the black and white version. Musically there were a few moments that stood out to me and I’ll probably catch more on my second viewing.



As for the story, it was what it needed to be. This is film where the overall story isn’t actually what’s important, and they do a great job of highlighting this. This is a film about Logan and his legacy and I think they pulled it off expertly. I thought the use of the comic books was very clever and an original touch. The “villains” served their purpose well too.



It’s not perfect...I think there were a few pacing issues and sometimes tonally it was a little off but it’s minor stuff that doesn’t really detract from the film for me.



Overall, I really loved this film and it goes to show that not every superhero film has to be about saving the world. This was a character focused, emotional and grounded journey that did exactly what it set out to!

In Logan, Charles mentioned the Statue of Liberty from X1 and mutants end up on the brink of extinction by the doctor embedding that anti-mutant chemical in the foods.

No more mutants would be able to be conceived (corn syrup), however he would be able to make people with the powers of pre existing mutants like he did with the X's, effectively taking control of the x gene.

I guess I wasn’t prepared for a last battle type of conclusion to Logan’s story.

Only those who can see past Wolverine’s angry façade(Two telepaths –Charles and Jean)  are able to see the amount of suffering he has endured. Only they know that his motivations to become an invincible killing machine were born of a broken heart and that wound has never been allowed to heal –oh, the irony. 

To see that the peace Logan desired was only possible through death –the only thing so long denied to him was hard to watch and even harder to accept.

However, I felt it was too depressing for X-Men. Geez, what happened to the world!? There are so many questions. But the next movies for sure will focus on the younger crew, so we won't find out until like 10 years from now when they catch up to this plotline.

I also felt it was a little unceremonious for the older X-Men cast. After Last Stand, the older crew never got to make a movie of their own. With this movie, it feels like Fox is saying only Jackman and Stewart deserve a proper farewell. What about Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, James Marsden? and WHERE WAS Ian McKellen!? I was sure that at the end Magneto would show up and rip out all the adamentium from Logan's body, totally would make sense. But it didn't happen.

deg58cz,"I am reading a lot of complaints and criticisms in this topic, but I just personally did not see them. The complaint about [the kids going to Canada to escape capture](#spoiler) reminds me of the complaint about the lack of exposition about the Mother's Milk in Mad Max: Fury Road. The movie had plenty of somewhat unnecessary exposition already, and didn't need more. 

I'd put the movie just above Days of Futures Past and tied with The Dark Knight when it comes to superhero movies. I think the only problems I personally had with the movie was the suddenness and handling of [Chuck's death](#spoiler), but it was evened out by the tender relationship being fostered by Logan and x23. 

The thing that surprised me most about the movie was that it wasn't filmed like a comic book movie.... at all. It was filmed like No Country for Old Men. The first chase scene reminded me of Fury Road, and the battle scenes at the end were visceral, not unlike good war movie choreography. The post-apocalyptic aesthetic in a non-post apocalyptic world was a genius touch. When you see Las Vegas in all its glory, or a clinic in a small town, it still feels like our world, but wrong. I loved the idea that we got from the trailer, that this was a post-apocalyptic movie, and it turned out it wasn't... well, for the humans. It was a post apocalyptic world for mutants. And it felt like that stylistic choice permeated the entire movie. If someone else wants to describe it better than I can, feel free.

Loved the movie. Loved the characters. Loved the fucking aesthetic. There were problems with the script and pacing towards the end, but I was enjoying myself so much that I was able to tune out any criticisms I had during, or after, the movie. ",5x7z96

degxbio,"Probably going to echo what the majority says, the trailers hyped me big time, the first one probably being one of the best trailers of all time with dat Johnny Cash fire. The film does not disappoint. 

I need to digest it a little bit to see where it lands, but it's pretty excellent. I've seen a couple of masterpieces accolades thrown around from a few critics, I'm not quite sure about that.

I love that the film is its own thing and that they're not tied to anything really, it just gives Mangold, Hugh, Pat & Dafne licence to go gritty and dirty. It's amazing that this even exists, Mangold can't believe they got to do it without any interference (especially with Fox) and it is a unique piece.

Granted, Old Man Logan went there first, but having Logan looking, feeling like shit with his body & abilities failing him is such a compelling concept dramatically. Especially as it brings us an incredibly badass scene with a Wolverine on crack for a brief moment.

John Mathieson does some great work, even though the nerd in me feels this film (especially being so removed from the other X-Men timelines) would have been a perfect candidate to be shot on 35mm film, it would have served it even better. There were also some brief moments of that nasty digitally motion blur, thankfully they are indeed brief.

The other reason I like this being its own thing is that it comforts me in a silly way to know that Logan & Professor X only die (or do they? ^^) in this timeline, while alive in the current ones.  The thing is, no one but us geeks will know that.

I'm kind of hoping Hugh will still come back at some point, even though I know (and he said so) that this is the perfect way to end this Wolverine's journey, but we've all seen actors or directors saying ""no more"", so fingers crossed sorta. Same deal for Stewart who apparently said he'd return if Deadpool was involved. Can Logan really die though? even the adamantium bullet in that dreadful X-Men Origins didn't do the trick, and well, he did get blown up by a nuke (correct right?) in one comics and he made it. 

X-24 was such a massive surprise for me, so badass & perfect. Hugh brings so much depth, remarkable, so is Pat, and Dafne is wonderful as Laura, the last third is a rollercoaster, notably that last scene, we knew it was going there, but I kept hoping. Then again, standalone in a way, might as well go there, otherwise there are no stakes. 

Boyd Holbrook is pretty great as well, he's having a ball :D The action is terrific as well, just really really propulsive and exciting. The score is good, but Beltrami is not a composer who really blows minds imo. 

No doubt X-23 directed by Mangold (he wants to do it) is coming next, selfish me hopes Hugh will come back, maybe with a good incentive.... ^^",5x7z96
deha75q,"Deadpool at the beginning though and ""Nathan summers cumming soon"" lol",5x7z96
dehcxgk,"First off, kudos to Mangold and Jackman for taking the character in this direction for the last chapter of Wolverine.  There was an actual story here with all sorts of tough choices that Logan has to make.  I'm not a big X-Men fan, I like it well enough, Wolverine has always been my favorite character.

My quibbles are minor, basically a little exposition and explaining early in the story.  Elizabeth Rodriguez was left with the tough job of describing everything. Glad to see Boyd Holbrook in a big budgeted film but thought his character was not as fleshed out as the others.  But he's a pro and does well.

Action sequences are very good.  Dafne Keen is very good.  But this is really on on Jackman's shoulders and this shows why he deserves all the big bucks.  The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises are the gold standards in this genre.  Logan is up there, but not quite at that level.  But it's far above other superhero films.

Oh, and the R rating really frees up the story to be as brutal as the story requires.  When you see PG-13, then punches are pulled.  Kids will end up seeing this anyway but this story has enough intelligence to get the audience emotionally involved instead of just be a big budgeted spectacle where you are just an observer.

Thumbs up.

Charles says he is 90-99 years old (nongenerian).  So that puts him between 23 and 33 years old in First Class.

deikppo,"Holy shit that was a good movie.  The X-Men films have always been a guilty pleasure for me.  If I was being objective I'd say none would be above 80% for me.  It's usually the same issues... the stakes are so high they can't possibly fail, they often spend too much time showing off the mutant powers, sometimes the mutant powers are a little cheesy or contrived, splitting screen time among a wide cast of characters means someone is always underdeveloped.

Not here.

It's close, personal, the stakes are real.  Logan is trying to run away from his past yet is tied down by it.

The fights are brutal, and they need to be.  It's a reminder of the brutality that Logan has to sink back into, and the shit he's done in the past isn't PG-13.

Laura is played very well... She is innocent and naive half the time, you forget she's a murderous rage ball.

They sprinkle in a few Easter eggs about the past movies without dwelling on them.  They hint at a cataclysmic event for mutants without stopping the film to talk about it.  There's enough to spark your imagination without bogging the film down.

This is the one x-men film I would legitimately call a great movie, no nostalgia or guilty pleasure.  90, maybe 95%.",5x7z96

I was good with Prof. X dieing and I knew Logan's was coming but saving him from X-24 only to have him die anyway! The she quotes that movie after they bury him. Then the moment when she tilts the cross to an X, it was like three punches in a row. Then BAM lights on, almost everyone in my theater was teared up.

Charles Xavier was previously really adamant to protect the girl and to keep journeying to the destination, so why would he all of a sudden leave himself, Logan and the girl open to attack by staying at one location overnight when it was clear that they were gonna be continuously followed? I'm aware that Charles wanted one last 'normal' night and he got it but it was still quite a selfish and out-of-character decision that left a sour taste for me throughout the movie since it made such a deep impact into the ending. Also why wouldn't the mutant children help whenever Logan was fighting off X-24? They managed to annihilate Donald Pierce easily so they could have definitely helped Logan earlier when he was held up by Donald & Zander and during him getting murdered by X-24.

And then they made the movie, and Hugh Jackman fucking nailed it. And so it began.

My friends and I went off to college, so I ended up watching X2 with my sister, who only knew of the X-Men from all the times I hijacked the TV after school.

For X-Men 3, I had met a beautiful girl, fell head over heels for her. And she loved me just as much, which meant coming with me for the Friday screening of the latest installment. And to my surprise, she liked it more than me. 

The years passed, life became Life, and the X-Men, featuring Jackman's Wolverine, have been there along the way, providing much-needed distractions from time to time.

Walking out of the theater last night, holding hands with the same girl from years ago, the nostalgia hit us hard. With each movie, a happy anecdote we'd forgotten about (""Remember you took so long getting ready that we missed the first 5 minutes of X-Men Origins: Wolverine and we didn't discuss the movie afterwards because I was still mad about that? Good times""). This was something we hadn't realized became a part of our lives together, as cheesy as that might sound, and we'd just watched it end. And what a way to end. ",5x7z96

It didn't emotionally manipulate you by putting a big montage of Wolverine's best scenes at the end to wrap the series up in a neat bow.

1.The underlying motif of the toxic, self-destructive masculinity that Wolverine has always represented, is shifted to its rightful origins in the Hollywood Western (or the Western aesthetic upon which it's based). When he's dying, he tells Laura not to be what they made her, which is as much about being a murder machine as the type of manhood that Logan espouses--desperately lonely, aggressive, incapable of sharing his burdens with others. 

2.In Old Man Logan, he kills the XMen. In the film, it's implied that Charles killed them during a seizure back at X Mansion. Logan wants to get that boat so he can take care of Charles away from people (who aren't as durable), knowing the difficulties of being near Charles during an episode. He was willing to do all that for his friend, including keeping the knowledge that Charles killed the XMen from him.    ",5x7z96

It's funny, so many superhero films started doing this 'gritty realism' thing, but watching this makes you realize just how much they really distance themselves from that with a PG-13 rating.  The violence, aside from just being awesome, really conveyed a sense of there being real consequences for our main characters.  Even the swearing made it feel more true to Logan' character.  I mean I've never read many comics, but the swearing was an unexpectedly great way to really sell the anger that is integral to him.

I loved the inclusion of the comic books into the movie.  Seeing the kid holding the Wolverine toy at the end nearly made me tear up.  

All in all, that was the perfect send off.  It was really something crazy seeing these characters we've been following since the early 2000's this withered and broken.  Like I knew this film was going to be emotional but damn, didn't expect to feel so much seeing Wolverine so vulnerable.

dej5jth,"My favorite super hero from my childhood died a badass, but I cried like a bitch. One thing that hit me was how Logan never heard the moment Professor X began to understand why he couldn't have a peaceful life before being killed by X-24.

Had they made Logan have some heartfelt advice to X-23 regarding family and friends. This could've been where he made some quick references to Jean Grey and Cyclops when talking about hardships in life, but that it's all worth it. But the ending scene did fuck me up, so I digress. 

Also, a YouTuber known as AngryJoeShow brought up a great moment of where we could've seen Hugh Jackman wear the iconic blue and yellow suit he has in the comics. It's where Logan carries Professor X up the stairs in the black families' home, and tucks him in as X-23 followed. At one point, we were given the viewpoint of X-23 looking through a small opening in the doorway, and this could've been where he has the suit on. Why? Well, she has to have been familiar with the X-men comic books since she carried a couple of them. Throughout the whole time prior to this scene, she saw Logan either pissed off or serious. But seeing him take care of Professor X could've help her realize that Logan is really kind-hearted. She would see him as the hero she thought he always was.

The entire third act of James back in Canada, dying in Canada, felt really awesome for Logans life to come full circle. The final fight was a meta fight concerning Hugh Jackmans legacy as The Wolverine, the fact he has to kill his younger looking self, the self everyone sees him as to move on and be at peace with himself, to finally hang up the claws was just awesome!


I really hope X-23 joins the X-Force and maybe Deadpool 2 could be about Deadpool finding a new Wolverine to replace Hugh Jackman, although that just might mock everything Logan has been doing and been about.

dekn9kb,"As /u/JeffTennis points out, this felt like the ""I Am Legand"" of X-Men movies (the book, not the movie).   Logan is broken and X-23 has to be disappointed that her father is just a dying drunk filled with angst and little compassion.  Charles does his best to show her love and respect while explaining that Logan is still a good man.   

Just like an angry teenager, she pushes back at Logan, telling her she'll be okay after he confesses that everyone he cares about gets hurt.  As the father of  16-year-old and 11-year-old daughters, this felt like something they'd say after we argued, after they were hurt.  

The last battle when Wolverine rescues the kids, that's him showing them what it means to be a real hero, his Battle of Rorke's Drift.  Fighting is not easy, gloryous or painless like the comics.  He is a reluctant warrior that knows each time his claws are unleashed, he is stepping another foot farther into hell.

It's at this moment that he inspires the new mutants . ..  and Laura understands better than anyone what it means to fight.  While she won't be the leader of X-23, she will be its moral voice, the seasoned leader guided by Charles and Logan. 

""There's no living with a killing"" is not just about the moral costs of fighting, but a reflection of the enemies they face and the world that is after them.  ""Reapers"" and other villains have traded their own humanity for power. She now faces that villain and must come to grips with it means to fight the good fight. 

Logan's last stand wasn't about anything else but doing the right thing. Laura realizes this and understands what it really means to be a X-Man. That's why she turns the cross to the side, as a reminder of the sacrifice that Logan made over and over to protect a world that didn't care about him or his friends.",5x7z96

[Both Charles and Logan dying was really a good thing for them. Charles had some sort of degenerative brain disease, he was going crazy because he didn't remember or understand why all the X-Men were dead, he kept having seizures... his life was not happy. The night he died was the happiest night he'd had in a very long time, and honestly I think that's a good way to go. I like to think that he knew it wasn't really Logan. In the moment he thought it was but I'm certain you know... as Logan stabbed him he knew it wasn't really him. I like to think that Logan knew how happy Charles was as well. Logan dying I feel was also a blessing for him too. He had wanted to kill himself for a very very long time.

dex08po,"While I really loved Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, I think Fox should start to develop Cyclops as he is one of the very main X-Men. Logan actually opens up the perfect ending and setting for it.

No new mutant births, near extinct race.. Sounds very much like post House of M in the comics. This is the part where Cyclops takes up the ultimate leadership of the mutant. Transforming from the good old hero into an anti hero with his ideals bordering between Magneto and Professor X. Many of his struggles deriving from the actions and decisions he made.

Eden could very well be the sanctuary Cyclops set up post mutant crisis and X-23 is just heading to meet Cyclops, the now head of mutant who is fighting to ensure the survival of his race. While he does not kill Charles Xavier in the movie like he did in the comics, he could very well be the one who exiled Xavier due to his instability and the movie could deal with his regrets on that action. I really loved Cyclops as a character in the comics and wished they could do a movie focused on this later part of Cyclops life.

I also did a little bit of research about how Logan and Prof. Xavier ended up in that situation. When old man Xavier was in that farm silo thing, and he asked Logan what happened to the other mutants (""what happened Logan, what did you DO?"") it carries an even deeper meaning than I realized.

And all you can do is shake your head and stay quiet because even though you'd love to talk about how fantastic the movie was, there were just so many good parts that you have no idea where to begin?


If you had told me I'd be feeling that way after a Wolverine movie a couple of years back, I would've called you crazy. For years I've sat through shitty Wolverine movies, groaned every time they announced a new one yet sat my ass down in the theater to watch each one just to be disappointed over and over again.


But this? This makes all those shitty Wolverine movies worth it.


I'm shocked myself that I feel this way seeing as, leading up to this film, I wasn't excited about it. I didn't give in to the hype. The trailers didn't interest me that much. I thought it was just trying to cash in on the trend Deadpool started by being an R-rated superhero film with more cussing and more violence.


But holy hell, this film makes Deadpool look like a PG movie.


Admittedly, its start is a little shaky. The bleak tone of the future is captured perfectly but in the first 20 minutes, Hugh Jackman drops more f-bombs than in a South Park episode. It got egregrious after a while, because look, we get it. It's R-rated. Wolverine can cuss now. There's also a random scene where a woman flashes her female friends while inside a limo -- again, why? Why would a woman flash her lady friends? It just seemed like unnecessary nudity just to remind us yet again that this is an R-rated film.


But once the film gets that (and the heavy-handed product placement) out of its system, it becomes stellar.


The tone of the movie is perfect all throughout. It's mature without being ""grim-dark"". It's so fucking bleak but they didn't need to constantly set scenes on rainy nights to show that. I was amazed, that, despite featuring two of some of the most powerful mutants, everything about their situation felt utterly hopeless. The stakes were high despite the fact that it was essentially just one long car chase, because the movie managed to emphasize how ragged and vulnerable both Logan and Charles are in their old age. You really felt the exhaustion of the characters as the film went on. Despite that, there was the right amount of humor to balance everything out. The jokes didn't feel forced, but rather they felt natural because we're so familiar with the characters and the lines sounded like things they would actually say. Example: when Logan hits the car, we laugh because he's lost it. But it's also a really poignant, sad moment because we know *why* he's so devastated and we know the feeling of being at the end of the rope. So instead of being a cheap joke, it's a character-building scene that still has you feeling emotional. Each joke built up the relationship between the trio and further emphasized their new (temporary) status as a family, but also still fit in with how bleak and grim things are for all of them. I felt the warmth between Charles and Logan, and this is what helped make the movie so enjoyable.


I've been bored by the recent string of superhero films so this one is truly a breath of fresh air because of how much it focuses on the *characters*. The build-up is great. The pacing worked for me, and I loved how information was released a little at a time so that everything is slowly pieced together as the movie goes on. Some people might find the movie slow because there are so many scenes wherein characters just sit down and talk. And that is amazing for me, because Jackman and Stewart sell it well and I felt the weight of their interactions. Despite the quiet scenes, though, I was still on the edge of my seat the entire time. There are enough action scenes that will still keep people entertained, and even as someone who's usually bored by Wolverine clawing at everything, this film doesn't hold back in showing the true carnage that results from his abilities. No shitty CGI claws to be found. The violence was there to show how fucked up the world was, how fucked up Logan became and how fucked up Laura was raised to be. It was gratuitous in the beginning; but by the end the brutality is jaw-dropping.


Jackman and Stewart are at top form, and so is the girl who plays Laura. The albino won me over, too. Jackman playing his own clone managed to be terrifying despite just being Wolverine with cropped hair and a black shirt instead of a white one. 


Like I said earlier, the film is so impressive that it's hard to just talk about one scene because everything was so well-done. I cried like a baby at least twice and I can't remember the last time I felt so emotional over a superhero film. The final scene in particular is gonna be stuck in my head for a while. In hindsight, I'm glad Deadpool wasn't in this because it would've been too jarring considering the tone of the film. I know people were seriously talking about Deadpool being nominated for Oscars, but that never made sense to me because I didn't think it was *that* good. But I would not be angry if Logan somehow got nominated.


My only quibbles with the film are minor: the fact that it gets fairly predictable the moment Wolverine's clone shows up. You basically know how it's going to end. That, and the reaver with the bionic arm seemed to overstay his welcome. I don't get why neither Laura or Logan killed him earlier or how he managed to survive a grenade explosion (which reduced the weight of Caliban's sacrifice, imo, why off yourself for a couple of goons?). Laura showing mercy to him in the beginning by just hitting him with a pipe doesn't make sense seeing as she shows no emotional attachment to him anywhere else in the movie. He's a regular human yet he manages to make it to the end for reasons I cannot figure out. I was expecting a reveal that would expose him as a cyborg or something (which would explain why he kept surviving) but there was none.


This is definitely up there among the best and Jackman shows that he doesn't need the MCU so please don't be sad about that, Hugh.

P.S. This is the second time a Hugh Jackman character has slowly died in front of their sobbing daughter and I've bawled both times.",5x7z96

dehnjau,"One of the only superhero movies that basically says that it's alright to be sad and walks you through it. I teared up at the end. It had a lot of heartache behind it. Patrick Stewart's aging, senile Professor X hit me hard, because my own Grandfather is going through a similar process. The whole movie was an amazing sendoff and never once did it lapse into that 'comic book' vibe that creates a divide between the audience and the story. You felt every frame of this movie, there was love and sorrow there in the soul of the thing. And it hurt to watch it end, but it ended with a sort of  satisfaction. A well made movie on every single front, from acting to special effects and shooting style. ",5x7z96
dehotyh,"I loved this film.

This isn't a ""superhero film"", it's a character piece based on a character from a comic book. It follows no timeline necessarily and stands on its own but same time exists within the x-men universe. From the start it sets the tone and atmosphere of the whole movie. it gives enough background information on Logan, Charles and X-23 where every impactful moment gets you right in the feels. It's the story of a man who has lost his family through time and disaster, losing hope and practically living day by day. He cares for Xavier who has been a father figure to him throughout the films, even after knowing what he did and is going through. He fears attachment and once x-23 shows up he declines helping her out of fear of hurting those who get close. 

The characters are well fleshed out throughout the film and the villains serve the purpose of pushing the hero forward. I hear people comparing to The Dark Knight but I feel this film lives up to its title and story better as simple as it may be. For a good as a movie as The Dark Knight, the villain and the actor who portrayed him made the movie what it was. In this case Logan is the foundation and every character helps to tell his story along yet they aren't overshadowed. 
The performance by Stewart and Dafne Keen are splendid. The Easter eggs scattered around the film are a nod to fans of the films and comics. The pacing and editing are well done, actions scenes are amazing and keep you on the edge of your seat. For me the best Parts were the scenes of Logan and Charles talking and the last 15
Minutes brought up some very manly tears. 

I was both excited and hesitant for the movie. The two trailers did justice in capturing what the film was about and the tone it set. Once the reviews came i just had to see if it lived up to the hype. It Did Not Dissappoint. I came out of it not saying it was a good comic book movie but rather a very well done film. I've watched it twice already and the second time confirmed it for me. 9.5/10 ",5x7z96

We sat there after the movie, had a beer, and tried to think of anything we could fault it for.  Plot hole, bad acting, dodgy effects, no.  Can't find anything.  This is the new gold standard by which other blockbuster movies should strive to.  ",5x7z96

Early in the movie, shortly after we see Logan pick up Xavier's pills, Caliban makes this crack that Logan can't even read that the bottle says ""ibeuprofen"".

That whole scene of Charles death was heartbreaking but extremely well directed and written. I dismissed the death thinking it was just a nightmare till i realised it was X-24 and then it hit me like a train that he actually was killed. The fact it was done by the wolverine clone also made sense since any other time Professor was in danger he paralised everyone around.

There is something to be said about how powerful an ending can be. So many of these franchises are now trying to go on forever or are being revived by studios who either want a quick buck or creatives who can't let their creation go. Of course you can apply that to the X-Men films too but at least for the characters that started in 2000 we have an ending for their stories.

Logan is so moving and emotional because there is a payoff to the character arcs of both Wolverine and Professor X. And that's something to cherish and appreciate that it also wasn't cluttered or unfocused. 

Avengers: Infinity War will have the task of being the ""culmination"" of everything but can and will it be as moving or emotional as Logan's ending despite having so many characters and world ending stakes? It's a tough ask.",5x7z96

He also was the one X-men member who would do anything to help those he cared for, seeing him with Prof X in this was truly the Logan i knew as a kid, pissed off, hating life, and yet doing everything needed of him. This was for me the best comic book adaptation i have seen that truly captured the character from the pages. 

Last thought, I know they are looking to cast the next wolvie, but i hope that it never happens.

I did come into it expecting it not be as upbeat and colourful as the core X-Men movies but I also didn't much like Logan and Charles' characterisations until Laura showed up and I saw some of their old selves return. I think the journey was more interesting than the characters most of the time.,5x7z96
dege24i,"DAE think that Hugh's performance is ""Awards nomination"" type?. 

Everyone was amazing, everyone, Boyd was a phenomenal villain. I loved how the director trusted us enough to fill in the gaps, giving us room to figure out on our own what went down.

deghvfo,"Anybody who says they don't understand why Wolverine would help the girl has obviously never watched or read anything with Wolverine in it before. One of Wolverine's defining character traits is the fact that he can't help but protect young vulnerable women. He _always_ has a young girl under his protection whether that's Rogue, Jubilee, X-23, Kitty Pryde, Armor or Pixie. Wolverine has continuously been a reluctant father figure to several young mutants.",5x7z96
degs1pm,"The thing I am loving most about this film, is just how nuanced it is.

With the exception of one obvious moment, there are no explicit plot explanations, vocalized purely to benefit the audience. No characters outright state their intentions or how they are feeling, or even verbalizes their emotions. Instead, the actors are allowed to 'act' and express their characters through subtle mannerisms and physical actions. For instance. Logan does say towards the end, that ""everything I care about turns to shit"", but before that moment, we are fully allowed to witness him feeling that. From his passiveness and uncaring attitude, to his reluctance to be heroic, to his pure unavoidable misery; this character expresses every syllable of that sentence well before he ever says it.

See, some of this is par-for-the-course in terms of the character. He is always dismissive, aloof and independent. He's never embraced being a hero, and he's never been happy. But this movie really sells us on just how defeated he has become. The perfect moment that stood out for me, is when the father character levels his shotgun at Logan and vengefully fires the already-empty weapon before falling to his death. Logan stands there as it happens. We witness his acceptance as the shotgun is leveled, his willingness as the trigger is pulled, and then his conflicting mix of sorrow and unsurprised disappointment, that this man and his family are another victim of his cursed existence. Initially, I thought he was far too passive about it, but I realize now that this is his coping mechanism. Of course, he feels absolutely devastated by their loss. We've already witnessed the appreciation he has for them, but he can't break down or indulge his undefinable sadness. He has to tough it out like he has since the beginning.

Another instance, is his inability to vocalize his grief at losing Charles. That is such a heart-wrenching moment as Logan starts to grieve and just as he begins to open up, stuttering and stammering, unable to quell his overburdened feelings, Laura softly grips his wrist to connect with him and he pulls back, walling up all that emotions and re-funneling it into fruitless anger. It's all he knows. In a way, it's much safer. That, to me, is an extra layer of sadness. He *can't* allow himself to grieve, even when he has the chance.

Laura does an incredible job of this herself. The camera spends a lot of time with her as she simply watches the other characters interact and express themselves. It allows us to visually understand just how attentive she is, learning all she can from her surroundings. What was especially fun for me to realize is that she never attacks Logan, even when he disciplines her. I feel this is worth pointing out because it shows that she has a pretty clear understanding of the world and how important intention is in social interaction.  She recognizes a distinct and important difference between Logan's aggressive interactions with her from those of her assailants and from out-and-out strangers. At the gas station, for instance, she reacts defensively when the attendant goes to politely stop her from stealing, but stops immediately when Logan grabs her arm. Now, she had only just met Logan at this time, and while he is obviously different from the other guys in this film and she obviously knows that they share the same abilities, he is still mean, angry and not-at-all likable. And yet, she still responds to him with reverence. This implies that her reactions are based around mutual respect. See, this isn't a fear response; she is never shown to be afraid at all over the course of this movie. And typical parental enforcement plays heavily on a child's mental and physical fear of their parent. But for Laura, she actively wants to respect Logan, and it's really cool how this movie lets her do so in her own ways, without the need to explain it to the audience.

I feel like very few movies these days are allowed this level of nuance.

dehwkpx,"I think people in my cinema were expecting a normal schlocky comic book movie, because they would not shut the fuck up :( so I did not have an ideal viewing experience.

I am the sort of person though who thinks this is the direction that comic book movies should take more often. I really like the more vulnerable performances, and how ponderous and more personal everything about it was.

I felt there was a little bit lacking in terms of the developing relationship between Logan and X-23. Other people in this thread have mentioned his fear of attachment etc., but I felt more like they portrayed his emotional wall at being 100% until they got to the hut with the other kids and the forest fight, and by that point the movie was pretty much over. As others have mentioned, they did show moments of conflict for Logan, like when he is trying to decide between going after Laura or going to help Xavier, but I felt like there could have been more of a progression from Logan resisting all the time to finally accepting.

Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart were both amazing in this. I think I will definitely have to see it again, hopefully in viewing where people aren't riffing the movie because they think it's too slow.",5x7z96

I like that this movie really explored Wolverine on a personal level and his Relationships between Charles Xavier and Laura.

I see this movie is kinda standalone movie on its own but at the same time it respects its source materials such as Old Man Logan or some X-23 arcs.

I think the only criticism I have is that there are some parts that little bit dragging in the middle and I wished it could be faster on those parts. Other than that this movie was really good and you'll have a good time.

dej2cjr,"Ok so let's get this out of the way first: Logan is incredible. It's a damn beautiful ending for one of comics most beloved characters, brought to life on the silver screen in a dark, gritty, violently emotional way by some immensely talented actors and writers. Until the inevitable reboot, this is the definitive portrayal of the Wolverine. 

Is it perfect? No. Some thoughts:

1. The only thing that really bothered me to the point of detraction (however slight) was X-24. Seeing another ""Logan"" was just weird and took me out of it. I understand he was a clone and everything, but it just felt unnecessary to me. I feel like they could have used another face and had it be just as effective. 

2. Can we just talk about how goddamned amazing Patrick Stewart was playing an old psychic with a debilitating brain disease? Like I legitimately had trouble hearing/understanding because he was THAT GOOD at playing old and frail. 

3. I understood the symbolism behind the admantium bullet, but did Logan forget (ha! pun.) that the last time that happened, all he did was lose his memories? I know, I know. Creative liberties and all that, but still. 

4. I remember FREAKING OUT when the trailer for Origins released and it had Logan asking Sabertooth if he thought cutting his goddamn head off might work. This movie makes that movie look like an episode of Barney the Dinosaur by comparison. In so many ways. 

5. How perfectly cast was Laura? I had a feeling just from the trailer that was going to be amazing, and sweet Christmas did she deliver. The fact that she didn't have a single line for a good 2/3rds of the movie and was still able to convey everything so convincingly is just a testament to her talent. 

6. Before coming to this thread, I didn't know what was killing Logan. I thought it was some combination of losing the will to live and some actual undefined physiological sickness. Now I know it was the adamantium. I'm not sure which I prefer. 

7. Hugh Jackman will always be Wolverine. He embodied the character with such passion and respect that, while I know a new actor will eventually pick up the claws, he'll have a damn hard time topping Jackman. 

I think that's everything. Whew. Such words.",5x7z96

dgzqzao,"I know I'm extremely late but I just got the chance to see this fantastic movie last night and I noticed something I didn't see on here.

Seriously though. The cinematography. The action. The acting. It's so perfect. I feel like this is the kind of beautiful send off a character like Wolverine needed. This raises the bar massively, in my eyes, for any superhero film. 

Rather than being a movie about all powerful mutants that are straight out of a ten year old's dreams (not that there's anything wrong with pure action), Logan was a truly relatable character. You can empathize with him so well. 

I love that he isn't presented as perfect. Old, grey Wolverine seems a lot more human than he has in previous movies.

I avoided trailers as best as I could so I had no clue what I was getting into (I'm not even too familiar with the comic storyline). This movie was brutal, and not just physically. I feel like they tore my heart out and left it mangled on the theater floor. 

There were so many scenes where I wanted to think ""damn, that's badass,"" but all I could think was, ""damn, this is so sad, why do they have to be in this fucking situation!?"" I need to go watch RV so I can remember how a road trip movie is supposed to feel. 

Overall, everything in this movie was done well. I love it when child actors kill it (no pun intended (damn, this is so sad, why do they have to be in this fucking situation)), the casting, the acting, directing, action, all very good.

X23 was great. Her acting and her relationship with Logan was really well written and performed.
The movie wasnt like a usual Xmen flick, at time it did drag but was a great send off for Professor X and Wolverine. The character of Professor X was rather difficult to watch as you can see the effects of no mutants had on the Professor. He was a left a hallow weak being from his former self. The most powerful mutant reduced to a feeble man was difficult to accept.
After the film ended I along with everyone else in the cinema was rather somber and sad. I grew up watching Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. I remember as a kid tapping three pens together to make his claws. Hugh Jackman will and always remain Wolverine for me. Its his performance that made wolverine my favourite Marvel hero.

The the break out happens. Sure laura and her friends lost alot of friends on the way but canada is the place to be and the wolverine is the only one who can get them there.

Picture Laura's surprise when she finally meets her hero who is a shell of his former self. a smelly, disheveled, drunk hobo. On the edge of the death. This isnt Wolverine she read about. this is some guy named Logan and just when logan thinks he was out, he gets pulled back in for one last ditch effort. He has something to live for.

I wonder too if in an earlier revision the Richard E. Grant character was Donald Pierce - he'd be pretty perfect cast as the comic version of Pierce who's a British fop, not really physically imposing and more of a behind the scenes mastermind guy who's fantastically sadistic - he was like the Ramsey Snow of the X-Men comics.  Probably my favorite comic book villain because he was so goddam evil.  Making him more of a Texas bounty hunter worked well enough but I never hated him quite like I did the comic version.

Edit: That famous X-Men cover with Wolverine nailed to the big X - that was Donald Pierce.  He nailed him up there and left him to roast for days in the Australian desert and would periodically come out to scream at him.

Also, every aspect of this movie is just a perfect fit for what was trying to be achieved tonally and story-wise. I mean the acting is phenomenal, the cinematography is gorgeous and fitting, and the writing is pitch perfect with a serious tone that has incredibly timed comic relief. This is exactly the good note that Jackman deserved leaving the franchise at, and it breaks my heart that we won't get to see him as Wolverine again; however, I feel good again just by the way he ended it in this film.

I need to go rewatch Shane and Unforgiven, both of which this reminds me of (even without the overt references to the first). Maybe some of the Man with No Name flicks as well.

I loved how the reavers were portrayed, especially how common artificial limbs were among their ranks. Someone with no idea where the story was going might rightly wonder ""what's up with all the robot arms?"" until the X-23 reveal. ""Oh that's why.""

Did it strike anyone else as fitting that the kids were all trying to escape to Canada? This is where Howlett was born, after all.

My one big suspension of disbelief moment came when someone asked me ""why didn't all the kids use their powers more?"" Do those bindings mute their abilities somehow?

17 years ago, X-Men was released. A movie that introduced super hero films as more than mere cash grabs from niche comic book fans. In 2010 and 2014, The Dark Knight and Captain America: Winter Soldier elevated comic book film standards by infusing comic book characters into genres of crime dramas and spy thrillers. In 2017, Logan pushes the envelope further by fusing western classics such as Shane and Unforgiven into not only a wonderful, brutal film but also the best send off for Hugh Jackman's 9th appearance as Wolverine. Yes, this movie is SUPER violent, there's a lot cursing, and it does something remarkable in the process, it makes you feel something and reminds the viewer why we loved super hero movies in the first place",5x7z96

There wasn't a happy ending for the X-men. Only bittersweet, bleak future that has some hope of a better tomorrow. ",5x7z96
degj0ja,"Let's go back. Let's go all the way back to X-Men 3: The Last Stand. Remember the cineturd? Definitely the worst X-Men movie, arguably the worst super hero movie. That's not the point though. In that film, Wolverine is in the woods fighting a guy who shoots wooden spikes from his hands. Fairly standard stuff: he shoots, Logan blocks; punch, kick, claw swipe. The end of the fight shows them running at each other and colliding, Logan killing his opponent with claws to the chest. 

Then Hugh Jackman does one of the best things I have ever seen in any film anywhere. It's so subtle and small it's totally easy to miss. 

When they collide, the bad guy leaves two wooden spikes in Logan's chest. Of course as it's Wolverine he'll just heal up. But when Logan stands and realizes that he has to pull those damn things out, he rolls his eyes, like, ""Damn it. This shit again. I ain't got time for this."" Like I said, super subtle. But the fact that Jackman made that choice made the character of Wolverine so much more real to me. Sure he can heal. But he feels the pain. And it's fucking annoying. 

Why am I talking about this?

In ""Logan,"" the pain is always there. He can heal, kinda. But it never goes away. Mentally or physically, he feels every bit of pain from over the years. He says as much when he's talking about his nightmares and how he's hurt people. He's hurt a lot of people. At this point, he's closing in on being 200 years old. That's a lot of blood on one's hands. 

The final battle is sad for many reasons. The first and most notable one is how Logan runs. Namely, he can't. Poor Logan wobbles across the glen in an effort to save those kids but he can hardly stand let alone run. 

And yes. Everyone has mentioned it. ""So this is what it feels like."" I immediately thought of the scene from TLS. Jackman says those words with a mixture of sadness and relief with a bit of genuine interest thrown in. He is dying. Sure, he's trying to be witty or whatever. But the sensation genuinely fascinates him. He's been alive for damn near 200 years. He's inflicted death upon possibly thousands of people. 

It's his turn now. ",5x7z96

The thing that keeps hitting me is how it makes all of the previous X-men films so much better. The acting and character development really do serve the characters well, and make their roles in the previous storylines so very bittersweet. It takes a lot of dedication to make that work in a series this big.

But, what I keep coming back to, is the 'comicbook' story element. Sure, I knew about it from the trailers, and they just seemed like a cool knod at first, but when you really think about it, it really does make this series of films that much better. In a lot of ways, it validates both the silliness and awesomeness of these films, because it takes those more grounded moments from the films, and re-tells them in an epic and inspiring way. It takes away the bitter taste from movies like Origins and the weird continuity, and just lets it be what it is: a bunch of costumed heroes saving the world together. It's almost the reverse of what this series began as: a modern re-telling of a cartoon, and that aspect gives everything an extra layer of reverence.

I Loved it and I can say with full confidence that this is my favourite X-Men film and one of my favourite Superhero films.

**The Good.**
-Never really appreciated how much Jackman brought to the character of Wolverine until I watched this and thought back to all the films he's been in. Especially X2. His character is beat up, depressed, has no real joy for life anymore and you can see that throughout the whole film until the end, and briefly the dinner scene where he has little blips of actual happiness. The interactions between Logan and Laura felt naturally hostile, as Logan is keeping himself from getting close to anybody because of what happens to people he cares about and the interactions between Logan and Charles was great too as they've known each other for years but still get on each others nerves. What I've always liked about Logan is that he makes a good leader even though he never wants to be, and when he finally does stand up to Transigen at the end the payoff is the children escaping; although at the cost of his life.

-Laura/ X-23
Firstly what a little badass! They made her mainly act through actions instead of words (reminding me of Eleven from Stranger Things) Although when she talks she gets to the point. I like how she still acts like a kid most of the time as well despite her horrible upbringing. And her fighting style while as savage as Wolverine's is much more agile and skillful which didn't just make her Logan's shadow. Her backstory was great as well.

-Professor X
Really caught me off guard when he starting F-bombing but it makes sense to be honest, especially thinking back on earlier films where he's a bit angry (mainly days of future's past). With him going from world's most strongest telepath, to a mentally ill old man that can't even use his powers without almost killing everybody. This would make anyone angry and bitter and it's great that he calls Logan out on his shitty attitude too. His death was really sad and Logan tearing up at his grave, he couldn't even get his words out, which was very emotional.

-The Cinematography and Effects.
When the movie began I expected that big title screen, loud music all that typical stuff you get in a superhero film. But with it just appearing, it made me feel this film was going to be much different than the other superhero films. The Action scenes are easy to follow and the slowed down dramatic scenes were very well done. The standout for me though were the seizure sequences, they really made me feel uncomfortable and quite nauseous, and watching the people in the casino hold their heads in pain and the slow choppy movements really showed just how powerful Charles is and why he was so dangerous in his current state.

-Wolverine Clone/ X-24
I really liked this too, All throughout the film Logan is battling with himself internally, then eventually he battles himself physically which I thought was great symbolism. It's even better when he loses because it makes the loss much more effective; instead of say, giving him a random power boost and have him win.

-The Story
Not much to say except I  really enjoyed it. Had themes of loss, responsibility, power and fear.

-The Comedy
As dark and dreary as this film was the comedic elements were timed just right. The part where they are shaving his beard is hilarious.


**The Bad**

-Both of the main villains
There was nothing to them really. Especially Boyd. He was funny and everything but no motivation as to why he's doing what he's doing except that its his job. The doctor also didn't have any reasoning except all mutants are bad. He did give a brief speech as to why he wanted to use the kids and got short by Logan ( I enjoyed this because he was going into a monologue, which I thought was funny) But I think the doctors motives should've been placed throughout the film.

-Logan and X-23's relationship
I felt this could've been expanded a little bit longer but this isn't a major gripe. He said they spent about a week together, Wish it was a longer road trip, maybe got to know each other a bit more before all the shit hit the fan.


Overall this was a damn good film and I really enjoyed it as I don't like the other X-Men films except 1,2, First Class and Deadpool.
It was a great send off for Hugh and Patrick and I feel more superhero films should be made like this.

Top Notch casting. I think it's the most underrated part of any production and they really nailed it. All of the major characters and most of them are ones past perfect. Totally believable and every aspect.

I didn't get emotional during the end scene with Logan and Laura in the theatre, but everything that scene meant and represented hit me hard about 30 mins ago.

A silent, laboratory-made, final boss for Wolverine to fight, where have we seen that before?

If I did have one complaint in the film it would have to be that that by the end the bad guys felt beyond boring and nonthreatening to me.  They really didn't ever use their cyborg parts to any effect and the harpoon gun had to have been an Old Man and the Sea joke.

You'd think after begrudgingly agreeing to stay the night, he'd at least stay by the Professor's side the entire time with the keys in the car's ignition ready to go at the first sign of trouble.

She went full feral when showing the full force of her anger. Then first her to go from screaming rage and show such tenderness with Prof. X and Logan. And finally her grief. How could you keep a dry eye?

Honestly, it's easy for actors of any age to portray an emotion. But to catch the nuances. Going from annoyance, stubbornness, just plain anger, fury and finally battle rage. I commend the James Mangold as well for being able to get all that out of her and make it feel  organic and not forced.

Of course Patrick Stewart andHugh Jackman were awesome as expected. I will say Stephen Merchant's Carliban added just the right amount of smarminess for both comic relief and then allow you to accept his redemption for being the Tracker.

There are wholes and other detractions. But who cares about them. The movie allowed me to escape while feeling that we saw the passing of the torch done the correct way.

My theory is I think Laura may have killed her in a fit of rage.

dex5k7m,"I really enjoyed Logan. It was an amazing end to a wonderful character. I have two main gripes, and though I'm an avid comic book/movie fan, maybe those with more knowledge could shed some light on them.

1. Considering that Prof. X spends a lot of time talking expostition about how important it is that there are more mutants (albeit made in a lab and not naturally born) and we find out that the kids're all grown from pre-existing mutants, I feel like they missed out on an opportunity to show us the X-Men ""reborn"" through the final action scene. I felt like Rictor had a Cyclops-leadership vibe going, and then he was an Earthbender instead. Seemed like some strange choices.

2. Nobody even addressed that Laura is a child with adamantium inside her, and how it will either horribly stunt her growth, kill her before/during adolesence, or at least leave her with a fate similar to Logan's.

For as heavily as this movie dealt in certain themes, I feel like the ball was dropped on these two points especially. I'll say again though, I loved this movie, and I nearly left the theatre in tears.",5x7z96

It was such a great note to end on, having him die for a purpose after so many screw ups in his life - kinda felt like a meta commentary on the franchise as a whole. A well-deserved send off for Jackman and Stewart, who both put their heart and soul into those characters regardless of the movie or its quality. 

I also liked how, even though eden wasn't real, the kids *made* it real by their own hand. Taught Logan that even in the darkest of times, not everyone needs to share his depressing world view, that you *can* find solace in hope and the comfort of others. The climax wasn't about the world ending or humanity being enslaved; just about one man and his choice to do what's right, and that ironically made the stakes that much higher.",5x7z96

dejlsbk,"It's everything I could've asked for in a Wolverine movie, especially a movie about the death of Logan. They set the tone brilliantly from the very first word (""fuck...?""), and followed it up with one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen. Seeing Logan's worn down claws slowly pop out, only for one to get stuck... Ouch.

Genuinely surprised they went that far with Charles' character, from the dimensia to the cussing. Felt so raw.

I can't say enough good things about Hugh's performance. Easily the most animalistic yet, his limp was perfect, the constant coughing, bloodshot eyes, and my favourite: the roar. At the end when we hear Logan's roar, then see him sprinting towards the men... Just perfect. Might sound circle jerky to some, but I fully support an Oscar nomination for his performance.  

I know a lot of you had issues with X24, but I fucking loved that twist. X24 was terrifying, and the look on Logan's face as he sees him walking down the stairs was heartbreaking. He looked afraid of going up against a young version of himself. The whole farmhouse slaughter was my favourite sequence in the movie.

I thought it was gonna go full cheese at the end with the kids, but thankfully it didn't. I was expecting Logan to give a speech, rally the kids to fight the oncoming Reavers, stand up for themselves, etc. Typical X-Men-esque end fight. 

The last act wasn't perfect, though. I would've preferred Logan to pass out less (3 times in the kids scene alone), and I would've liked Logan to use the adamantium bullet to kill X24 himself rather than have X23 do it. But the last scene with Logan and Laura was beautifully done. Was REALLY hoping those rocks weren't going to start moving at the end.

Also, Donald Pierce was awesome. So much swagger and charm. ""Just a flesh wound, baby."" So smooth. Great screen precense. Was hoping to see him fight/kill someone though, even a quick hand to hand with Logan would've been cool.

All in all, amazing comic book movie, easily in the top 5 best, and more importantly, just a great movie in general. Great drama, badass action, beautiful world building, dialogue was on point, amazing performances, really cool music, wonderfully directed.

derfx08,"I'm probably going to get roasted for this but... This was 2/3rds of a great movie and 1/3rds of a mediocre one.

The first hour was just excellent. Atmospheric, well paced, gritty, and forlorn -- everything I wanted in Logan's final chapter. The farm house confrontation, when  Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) turns into a lackey and AltWolverine shows up, is the start of the mediocre section of the film. There were great moments in the last 1/3rd of the film but they were overshadowed by, in my opinion, a complete betrayal of the film's set-up and premise.",5x7z96

deh0fwf,"There are two moments that particularly stand out for me. Both happened in the final third of the film when Logan is recovering while the children prepare to depart for the border. The first being when Logan tells Laura, ""You have to learn to live with that,"" regarding essentially murdering people. Laura's response to this is, ""But they were bad men."" Logan muses right before nodding off, ""All the same."" For him, it's not about what the men did, it's not about if the countless people he's killed and maimed were good or bad people, it's about the fact that you have to live with the taking of another's life. Something that he has no choice but to live with as he cannot be killed. 

This moment then segues to another when Laura asks him what the adamantium bullet is for. Logan begins to concoct some bullshit as to it being a keepsake but then ceases to care and reveals to her, ""Actually, I was thinking of shooting myself with it."" The way Hugh delivered this line absolutely broke my heart. Acceptance, acknowledgment, and actually saying out loud to someone that you've been thinking about suicide. 

I absolutely adored this film. ",5x7z96
dehrjub,"I'd argue this is the best superhero film, in my opinion at least. 

The important messages it gives, alongside it's very grim themes makes it stand out from almost all other superhero movies. 

I interpreted the movie as a story about family, it focuses on the relationships between the characters and how much they mean to each other, and does a really fucking good job at it, it's very convincing how much these people care for each other but I'll mention more on performance later.  This makes Charles' and Logan's deaths more heartbreaking, especially when looking at the character who witnessed it and the way they react to the event. Laura's X gravestone thingy was really fucking epic, and fucking sad, it really made the ending even more epic *(and emotional)*

The performances in the movie were fucking amazing, almost all the roles were done perfectly. Jackman and Stewart as usual do not disappoint in the slightest, this was easily my favorite versions of the characters overall. Both nearing the end of their lives, and both broken in some way. They're both very convincing and it makes their deaths feel very real. *(also epic)*

The villains were cool, although admittedly I feel they were underdeveloped a bit. 

* Pierce was pretty awesome, especially in the first act of the film. After Caliban blows up the truck and it's kind of unclear if Pierce survived, I was glad to see he made it out alright. His very intimidating and dominant personality was cool to watch, his death was strange but still cool however. 

* The spotlight was taken off of Pierce once X-24 is revealed, and it's a very exciting and **fucking EPIC** reveal. He's a very intense character and works well being Pierce and Rice's muscle toward Logan. Although it isn't really explained clearly how he came to be *(being Logan's clone and all)* but afaik it was from the events of X-Men apocalypse *(post-credits scene )*, I only read this from reddit though, so if it was mentioned in the film I completely missed it.

* Rice was a villain whose motives and previous actions were explained poorly imo. So Logan shooting him in the head meant nothing to me. He was necessary for the plot though so I didn't mind too much.

* The biggest issue I found myself noticing during the film was that although the villains motives were there, they weren't too clear to me. This might have been due to me missing something though so I'll leave this open as opposed to an actual criticism. If Pierce was after the children to kill them anyways, why didn't he just kill them. Unless Gabriella meant actually making them go to sleep, and not killing them. Regardless, as I mentioned earlier. Rice's whole ""I tried to control mutants"" thing was still kind of unclear and I couldn't quite piece together what he did, considering we know it had to do with Charles. *(unless the mutants were wiped out in 2 separate events? oh fuck idk haha)*

The scenes where Charles is having a seizure were actually really fucking intense also. It's no wonder it killed all of the mutants :v

Also, in what should be the final point, I loved how little the trailers revealed about the film, I thought that there wouldn't have been anything to reveal that the trailer didn't. But oh shit I was wrong. The music choice in the trailers were also very good c:

*actually also I didn't mention it but Dafne Keen was really good in this movie !!*

tl;dr - amazing performances, amazing story, amazing movie

deitvof,"Maybe I missed something, but it's hard to believe that Logan's healing factor has been chugging along fine for 200 or so years, and then finally at the 220 mark his healing ability is drastically reduced. Isn't it possible that whatever they put in the world's food supply to stop the birth of mutants, also slowly suppressed Logan's healing abilities? I mean he was fine in DOFP when it was 2023, but here it's only 2029 and he's a wreck. 

The psychological toll of the other X-men being completely wiped out has to be factored in, but I wasn't quite satisfied with the idea that his adamantium has always been poisoning him, and it's only now that his healing ability is diminished that it starts to show. 

Edit: Like a bunch of you guys pointed out, I didn't consider that the adamantium only came into play around the 1970s or so. That's a reasonable timeline for it to start affecting Logan's healing factor. Still think the ""gmo"" cornsyrup had something to do with it too, since in the DOFP timeline that's only 6 years earlier, Wolverine's still relatively healthy.",5x7z96

When Laura turned the cross into an X, and when Logan said ""So this is what it feels like,"" were the two moments for me that really set me off. 

I kind of hoped that X-24's claws were like Daken's in the comics, because he was also Wolverine's son in a way, just as a nod to the source material.

dgonqub,"My favorite action scenes are when X-23 and Wolverine are fighting side by side, especially at the end. 

What I really liked about X-23's character is they really made her into a character people really loved. Wolverine is gone now and not as a ""replacement"", but the person to carry on what he's left behind is just perfect. I doubt very many people thought ""ugh, Wolverine is gone and we're stuck with this brat"". Nope, they did an excellent job and I'm more than sure that future X-men movies will continue doing a good job.

It's a little interesting what the X-men series can do right now because they can continue the 1900s X-men timeline (taking place after Apocalypse), or the ""current-day"" timeline (deadpool, around 2016~), as well as the future timeline with X-23 (Logan, around 2029~)

Whereas the MCU has multiple series taking place in different planets/countries/galaxies, X-men has multiple timelines to work with.

I'm quite interesting in watching X-23's timeline right now though, more than the other ones. ",5x7z96

deg5tld,"“Logan” takes a little while to adjust to its long overdue R-rating, throwing curse words around like they’re going out of style, but once it settles in it just punches you in the mouth. Relentlessly. This is not a film that could have been handled any other way; it’s oppressive, violent, unyielding – depressing in how beloved characters are presented, but beautiful in how their journeys are represented. It’s dirty and uncompromised; the heroes aren’t heroic, and the villains aren’t cardboard cut-outs. The stories tackled are adult in nature; people die in very personal and visceral ways, morality and righteousness are sliding scales.

Mangold and Jackman hit gold on their first outing – and given the trajectory of this standalone trilogy, it should be no shock that “Logan” is by far and wide Hugh Jackman’s greatest portrayal of the character, and a near-perfect superhero opera for James Mangold.

Logan takes responsibility for the preceding movies through a series of meta winks and clever narrative structures; the legacy of the franchise, of the characters, is a heavy one and the film wants you to know this. It was only afterwards on reflection that I started to appreciate the franchise's preceding events – the genesis for this film’s narrative being the culmination of 3 or 4 of the X-Movies. That said, some of the narrative beats from the franchise are recycled to mixed effect; whilst some of them are obvious attempts to redeem their predecessors’’ mistakes, some of them feel a little more predictable and perhaps even lazy.

I was a little disappointed that the “The Wolverine’s” samurai elements were all but dropped in favour of “Logan”s cowboy aesthetic. Obviously the two film’s different genres required different things, but a defining feature of the Wolverine character is that internal battle of his samurai ideologies clashing with his instinctual animalistic brutality, and I felt that was lacking here. It being a swan song for the character I was left a little unsatisfied by Wolverine’s send-off; he was a passenger of his own death, helpless against a thoroughly under-developed villain. We’ve seen the character in that situation countless times before, so it would have been nice had the film given us something worthy of the character (adamantium shower anyone?). Overall, whilst the climatic acts included very little screen time for “Wolverine Prime”, what was there, barring the above example, was of the absolute highest quality and the passing of the torch/X-23 team-up scene was worthy of the price of admission alone. I should also mention that Dafne Keen was fantastic as X-23.

Small gripes aside, and I should stress they are small gripes, “Logan” is a masterful, well-crafted, and fully realised visionary film. For what “The Dark Knight” achieved in 2008, “Logan” should be able to replicate if not surpass its impact in what is now an almost fully saturated superhero market.",5x7z96
dehy0we,"I was blown away. I absolutely loved it. It had a perfect balance of character drama, action, and thought provoking writing. This is what more superhero films should aspire to be, the Christopher Nolan idea of treating comic book films like any other serious film, just that they happen to be starring comic book characters. Several times throughout I was almost moved to tears as a grown adult comic book fan, especially the stuff about family and [Logan and Charles being the two remaining members of the team](#spoiler). 

Very little negativity for me to point out here. I loathed X-Men Apocalypse, I thought it was a cheap cash-in riding on the heels of how great DOFP was. I'm glad Logan has made up for it, even if it's not directly related to those films. I went in with 0 expectations and was very pleasantly surprised. This is not for the short attention-spanned Fast & Furious crowd. I heard people whining and bitching that it was too long, not enough action, and that there was no post-credits scene. It would be nice if people could try to enjoy it objectively without having to compare it to anything else. Everyone did a great job, including Laura - what a savage little beast! 

Can't wait to see it again. 10/10. I haven't been this buzzed after seeing a movie in quite some time, kudos to everyone involved. ",5x7z96
deusf45,"Honestly, I may be in the minority. I think the film was good but not really that great as everybody is making it be. There were only two things that literally astonished me and it was Hugh's and children's acting skills. Besides that, nothing really shocked me in a positive way.",5x7z96

degj9z9,"I almost cried three times when I saw this on Wednesday evening. Once when Logan was going berserk on X-24 after he killed Charles (seriously, the emotion packed into that fight was phenomenal); again when they buried Charles and Logan was on the verge of tears; and when Logan died.

I'm so used to seeing blockbuster movies play it safe with their characters - this franchise in particular - that I think the fact that both Professor X and Logan died in one movie is shocking enough. Not to mention the way which they went out; in a conventional blockbuster, their deaths would have meant something to their characters and would represent a sense of completion.

Charles got stabbed in the middle of an emotional breakdown, dying thinking that his only surviving student killed him. Logan died because he, as well as his body, gave up trying to heal. Combined with the knowledge that Charles' entire life's work has essentially amounted to failure and destruction (as well as Logan's recent work), it was just so fucking tragic.

I didn't think it was perfect. I thought the first 40 minutes, up until the Reavers attack their hideout, went by too fast and were too loud; I pictured the film as being very silent and reflective, but the opening was consistently blasting out Beltrami's score and filling the frame with lurid neon lights. I much preferred the rest of the film, which was slow and melancholic.

I also think that Mangold made a mistake in setting it in 2029. His reasoning was to distance it enough from the ending of DOFP, which was all bright and sunny, but 5 years really isn't enough distance. Sometime in the 2030's, maybe 2040, would have felt a more realistic time gap, and it's not unfeasible that both Logan and Charles could live to that point. It also would have aided the dystopian nature of the movie; part of the reason Old Man Logan works so well is because the entirety of America really is in ruins. From the glimpses we got of non-mutant life, everything is just fine for normal people in 2029. It really didn't gel with the sense of melancholy, decay and age which the film was primarily focused on.

But other than that I loved it. I'd give it an 8.5/10. Not quite a masterpiece, but close, and a fitting conclusion for these characters.",5x7z96

Special props to Dafne Keen whom I had to look up just because she was so amazing in the movie. She played a make it or break it role and gave a fantastic performance (as X-23/Laura), probably one of the best child actor performances I've ever seen.

Logan is the Wolverine movie that I wanted to see, it's not PG it's a hard R. The violence was simply beautiful, we really get to see what Wolverine's claws are for.

Overall I think Logan is a great movie with amazing performances all around. It's a depressing film and it ends on a sad note, but not without hope. The final outing of Hugh Jackman's wolverine was truly **X**celent (see what I did there?).

dehozeb,"Okay, I had a thought today I need to confirm about why Logan and Charles are the only two mutants left out of all the X-Men/ students. Yes, the virus can explain it, but I did wonder how EVERYONE was gone.
It is mentioned that they are hiding in Mexico because of the effect Charles seizures have on others- that he is wanted after an episode in Westchester. I assumed he killed humans. Later, Charles asks Logan where the others are, to which Logan replies that they are gone. Charles is distraught asking Logan 'what did you do?! ', which seemed a bit of an over reaction, to think someone caused them to be 'gone'.
Then later, Charles thinks he is talking to Logan and says that he remembers what Logan won't tell him, that he did an unspeakable thing in Westchester. 
Logan seems to be one of the only people able to survive the impact of the seizures. The albino mentions at one stage he couldn't breathe and any longer he would have died.
Westchester is where the school/mansion was. Charles killed all the other mutants who had survived the virus there, with only himself and Logan surviving. That's why no one else is alive. Thoughts? ",5x7z96

I would also like to note I thought the portrayal of X-23 was fantastic and Dafne Keen nailed the role. I would like to see her in future X-Men/Wolverine films, perhaps taking on the Wolverine mantle as she does in the comics. She is young enough where she could really grow and take on the role for a long time to come.

It was badass, it was touching, it was absolutely heartwrenching, and it was even funny without being excessive with its humor or groan inducing (although if I have one complaint, it's that they shouldn't have thrown in the part where Logan beats on the truck with the shovel). In terms of tone, it was practically flawless in what it set out to be.

One that breaks the characters down from high and mighty paragons or brooding antiheros down into the scariest things of all. Humans. Real People. Logan was a Fantastic deconstruction of the genre and a bone splitting adventure and a heartbreaker.

I was waiting the entire time he was laying there dying, for one of the original xmen to come and investigate the sounds of battle and find the children. An older Storm or Beast or even Jean, as she could have survived. The radio broadcast about the casino incident only mentions 'most' of the Xmen being gone, but it could have been more than just Logan and the Professor. It would be in character for logan, seeing the devastation, to take Charles as far away from his loved ones as he could, so they wouldn't be hurt anymore. Imagine if a graying Famke Jansen came into view and held logans cheek as he was laying on that tree.
""Logan... Why did you run...?""
""... To keep what was left of my family safe.""
And she'd give a little chuckle, and kiss him. He'd smile, and lean his head back slightly. The children's future would be far more assured with one of the OG Xmen there to take care of them and guide them, and the movie would have ended with the dash of hope that it needed in the pit of darkness it was. It would have been like a candle in the dark and really brought an amazing story together, because I'm left worried about the kids, and thats my only gripe is that it almost seems like they may have died for nothing, as the comic showed it was all just a fantasy.

The comics have been this way for a long time - there was the fun, cartoony version of Wolverine in the old-school X-Men, but there were more mature interpretations as well - different products for different audiences.  I'm not saying that additional violence and language make a film inherently better, you can have a fantastic film that doesn't need those elements.  But when those elements *should* be included but are toned down or removed to fit a specific runtime or MPAA rating, the film will feel false, and if there's one thing this movie got perfect it was the brutal grit that Wolverine encompasses that has never been allowed to appear on screen before.

I feel like after Deadpool and now Logan, we might be on the cusp of an era of really great comic films.  The 'origin/villain' template that was established in Batman '89 might have finally run its course and we can begin to actually see these characters in great stories, instead of the movie simply feeling like the character's background from Wikipedia.  The funny thing is, the stories are already there in the comics, but studios have just underestimated the audience's ability to comprehend what was going on without spoonfeeding every connection between films.  Logan broke free of this spectacularly, leaving you free to piece together the history on your own, but also realizing that, if you don't care about all that, the movie stands fine independently.

The bar has been set pretty high, and I'm amazed to be saying that with this being a Fox Marvel film, but I was really surprised and feel like they finally broke through walls that we have all been asking for a long time.  Can't wait to see how the other studios respond to this.  DC specifically has a lot to learn.",5x7z96

Captain America: Winter Soldier is the greatest movie to adapt from the source material. It is a perfect translation of what I imagine in my head when reading comics. Once again, my opinion.

I feel every death in this movie just felt under played. When Xavier dies I felt too distracted by the fight with Young Hugh Jackman (I forget it's name) to really feel any emotional impact. Then obviously the villains aren't supposed to bring any emotional impact, but then Pierce is just beaten by some kids and it just felt rushed or something. Like the main villain is killed off in a second not by Wolverine and that's it. Then when Logan died, idk...maybe I'm soulless. It didn't really feel too emotional until she switched the cross into an X.

I liked the movie a lot but it really felt like the villains were underwhelming and it didnt feel all to emotional for a farewell to two chacters. Young Hugh was sort of lazy too. Like he's the equivalent of Deadpool in Xmen Origins again, him just fighting a killing machine again. I guess this one's his younger self so maybe there's a metaphor or something.",5x7z96

X24 wasn't able to heal from the damage he took at the farm and needed to be injected with the 'super serum' By Dr. Rice to recover, - Weapon X/Wolverine would have been able to heal from wounds like that. 

That shows the clones regenerative powers were deliberately neutered compared to Wolverine's, presumably to avoid a repeat of what happened with Weapon X (the potential go rogue and be beyond control)....but it doesn't explain why he was able to heal normally (ie instantly and on the fly) from stab and slash wounds like Wolverine was in his prime. 

For example he gets stabbed about 100 times at The Farm fighting Logan and Laura, but seems generally non-phased by this as he's healing as quickly as he's taking damage - which shows he does have wolverines healing ability. 

How he seems unable to recover from serious trauma for some reason, but he doesn't actually die - but sort of hangs there in a suspended useless state (like at the farm) until he is injected with serum. 

Yet later he gets squashed by a truck, yet also appears totally fine with that and shrugs it off! So he 100% does have rapid healing ability...sometimes. 

Anyone shed any light - just what exactly is the deal with X24's healing ability? Because it's a part of the movie that has left me confused. ",5x7z96

Since she only has adamantium on her claws, she should live even longer than Logan and he lived to almost 200! Her friends are all she knows in the world with Logan gone and they're all going to be gone much earlier than her even if they last a full lifetime. So my question is, do you think they're going to bring in Sabretooth or Daken? As far as I know, Sabretooth had no rapid-healing children and Logan had no others in the same universe aside from Daken. Even if Laura doesn't get along with Sabretooth or Daken, at least she wouldn't be so alone. What do you all think? Will they bring either into any future films with Laura? I do know that they were originally thinking of bringing Liev Schreiber back for a brief cameo in Logan to help them out of a tight spot after Xavier dies but they dropped the idea because they decided that would take the focus off of Logan and Laura.

The movie itself is a amazing send off for Hugh Jackman after 17 years of playing Logan and a good send off for Patrick Stewart as well. Its a goddamn travesty that we finally got to see the real Wolverine in action after so long. The audience in my theater audibly wept in the final scene as did I. 

The movie adapts Old Man Logan and Death of Wolverine perfectly. Although I was a little confused if Professor X actually killed off the X-Men by accident.

degnr54,"I loved X-23 in this movie and thought Dafne Keen did an excellent job playing her. I actually hope that they let her pick up the mantle of Wolverine in a couple of years rather than recasting Hugh. 

Since there is next to no criticism among the comments here I thought I'd share some of the things I thought could've been done better in the movie. 

* Charles' death. The execution here was a little bit off, for me at least. I think it was a mistake introducing X-24 in such a fashion because it detracted from the emotional moment of Xavier's death. Instead of me being like ""Oh no Xavier's dead, how sad!"" I was like ""Wait, is that Hugh? Oh it's a dream."" then the scene continued and I realized ""okay this can't be a dream"". **So for me the moment of Xavier's demise was overshadowed by all the questions and thoughts going on inside my head regarding X-24 and what had just happened.** This could've been dodged if they revealed X-24's identity earlier.

* X-24 as a whole. He wasn't Deadpool from Origins bad but he was pretty lame nonetheless. I think having Liev Schreiber reprising his role as Sabretooth or as a clone of Sabretooth would've been much more intimate and intriguing than simply having Hugh play a younger, more feral and mute version of Wolverine. 

* Boyd Holbrook's characters death (Steve Murphy from Narcos). Wolverine said earlier in the movie something along the lines of ripping out his heart as a response to Boyd's comment of Logan breaking his heart. I think it would've been fun and fitting for Wolverine to actually rip out the heart, Mortal Kombat style. This death could've been really satisfying and fun while the one he got was just fine in my opinion, some of the kids looked silly.

None of these three things I brought up are big deals but I think that my adjustions would've made the movie even better, at least for me. Let me know what you think about my adjustions. 

Also there was no Deadpool preview/teaser/whatever when I watched it (I didn't even know there was supposed to be one) and now I'm kind of heartbroken, more reason for me to buy the Bluray I guess. ",5x7z96

This movie was one of those movies that the more I analyzed it the more I loved it. With action movies I can tell you almost immediately walking out of a theatre if I liked it or not. But some movies take hours or even days to marinate with me and for me to process them. In this case the more I analyzed it the more I loved it. First off yes there were things that could have been fixed, ex x-24 I wasn't crazy about.
/

The relationship between Charles and Logan was fucking beautiful the more I think about it the more you can see a genuine love between the two characters, though they do not like to show it. I also completely bought Logan as being as fucked up mentally as he is. Everyone he has loved died, he is 200 years old and the world is against him. The more I think about the relationship between X-23 and Logan I find beauty in it especially her reading those comics. She identifies with Logan because he has the same powers as her. She has no parents, is forced to kill and views Logan as a larger than life superhero who has the same powers as her which helps her cope. I also think it makes her view him as a father figure. She doesn't voice her affection because of her rough upbringing but I could see how distraught she was at the end. This is my own interpretation however.

This movie lacked grandeos special effects, Disney humor, and kept me guessing the whole time. It took big turns in the story line and sometimes went a horrific direction (Farm Family) I did not want the movie to end.

I don't want to shit on other superhero movies....but I am. I recently saw Dr.Strange about a week ago and I forgot it the next day. Logan stands out as a superhero movie that is one of the best of the superhero genre, because it is just as powerful of a story without the action, colors and special effects. It is sad that this movie will probably not win any awards and not make as much money. My theatre was dead on a friday night lol. Anyway thats all my opinion.

Logan was easily convinced by Charles to stay over at the farmhouse  because he was feeling sure of himself. When those ambiguously racist farmers came to harass Logan's friend, he instantly picked a fight with them and won. He believed he could protect all of them.

By the time Logan and the farmer come back, Logan's whole world is in shambles. Professor X has been stabbed through the chest by his mindless clone, an innocent family's eviscerated bodies lifeless on the ground, a child he suspects of being his daughter being cuffed away to be experimented on, or worse...And then the line: ""It wasn't me."" his last words to Charles. This scene totally breaks Wolverine!

**Something I also founded cool, he uses the [the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagrTsi5vsw&t=45) lunge move in the forest scene when he's juiced up. That's what Logan at a 100% is capable of.

On another note, Deadpool and Logan have been such a breathe of fresh air for the comic book genre. Don't get me wrong, some humor is appreciated in these Marvel films, but when it's pushed almost every second or when a powerful, evil character is trying to kill the protagonist, it feels out of place.

After decades of warring with each other, they're just two broken old men who were both wrong about the future of mutantkind. Magneto is captured by the bad guys and the bad guys attempt to force him to help fight one last time against the last X-men. But he sacrifices himself to help Xavier and Wolverine much like Caliban did. Imagine if Wolverine buried the two of them side by side.

While poignant, I was hoping he would either not die or die while fighting at full strength rather than his weakened state. It felt a like a weak death for a character who was so defined by his strength. Maybe I'm missing some character development here, but I just wasn't a fan of it.

I get that stories need to change and evolve and adapt to outside circumstances such as actors moving on an whatnot.

Furthermore, how does a wooden stick puncture an adamantium skeleton? And killed by a villain that was undeveloped and pretty much anonymous. I guess in the end the villain is not really that doctor dude and his minions, but their society and how it forced them to live shitty and unhealthy lives.

1. I guess both James Mangold films have that one little thing that doesn't fit the tone, like the giant Silver Samurai robot in the first one. In this one it is X-24. I know people will say it was Wolverine vs his dark nature, but I'm pretty sure that's the same theme in every protagonist vs evil clone story. It's kind of played out and instantly made me groan.
2. I wish X-23 and Wolverine had more conversations. They flesh out the Xavier and Wolverine dynamic pretty well, they should have done the same for Logan and the girl, maybe talk to her about his past a bit more and how life as an animal has been for him. Just so it doesn't feel like he ends up loving her because the plot requires it.
3. I wish the bad guy was more personal to Logan. X-24 should have been Sabretooth. It would have had the same effect as Wolverine vs his dark side, but it would have also been about his past. Plus X-23 and the kids could have seen a battle they have only seen in the comic books. I think that would have been cool.

Also, because the story of an ex badass at the end of his life coming out of retirement and on the run is kind of familiar, it was easy to see where the plot was going. But I won't hold that against it.",5x7z96

dekrqk9,"The whole X-Men comic book thing directly correlates with the final shot and what Laura does at his grave.

Logan writes off the comic books because they make him incredibly angry for 2 big reasons: 1) They are a fantasy, and don't really show the pain and hardship they went through and 2) he doesn't like seeing the X-Men considered ""superheroes"" because he believes he is no hero.

But Laura having the comics was significant for a reason: she had those comics because she knew her father was in the X-Men. And it was her only link to him; she never thought she'd meet him (or thought he was gone).

I see people say that Charles likely told her about their past. But he didn't through dialogue, and it wasn't shown, so it had to be telepathically. However Charles would have had to explain his gift to her (like he did to Logan in the first movie) and also Charles was well aware his power was not in his control any longer (and using it could harm her) so he didn't. The movie also told a lot of things (him killing the X-Men, the food being poisoned) so if he had told her about their history, I think it would have been said or shown. 

Which means that Laura knew her father was The Wolverine, part of the X-Men specifically through those comic books. And the movie doesn't specifically show or tell you anywhere that she has this knowledge until that ending. And again, while you could say that Charles told her, I like to think the comics were there for that reason. 

The significance of that also has a double meaning as well: because she knows of the X-Men, and the legacy of her father as The Wolverine, her turning that X tells the audience that the X-Men, and specifically The Wolverine, will return: with her taking the mantle and the other mutants leading the next generation.  

TL;DR: Laura turning the cross to an X at the end is the only acknowledgment the audience gets that Laura knew her father was Wolverine and part of the X-Men. Even though people say Charles likely told her, he would have had to explain to her (like he does to Logan in the original movie) that he can communicate that way. Therefor I believe she only knew about her father through those comics, and never thought she'd meet him. And her turning the X signifies her intent that the legend of The Wolverine (and the X-Men) will live on.",5x7z96

If you've ever been cautious about a movie then logan is definitely not the movie you should feel cautious about. Its a value watch. I regret nothing shelling out for this masterpiece send off. 

There are big gripes though. There is no context in the story as to how wolverine is suddenly so weak and why Charles is suddenly so afraid to use his power or just downright a cranky old man. If you've read the graphic novel/comics about old man logan(s) you'll understand why his powers deteriorated so far and what triggered it to be like that. 

Literally my only gripe with this movie is it kinda hopes you've read its source material its based off of.

Instead, ""Logan"" focuses on being a very grounded well acted, & well written character piece first & a comic book movie second. The action may happen with less frequency but when it occurs it's gleefully cathartic R rated violence.

deg77nh,"My brief synopsis: 

>*Logan* is a film where the titular character is a veteran with PTSD, working as a limo driver, trying to keep his head down to avoid a dark past, while also caring for his friend and mentor, a nonagenarian invalid called Charles. Through a strange woman, Logan is united with Laura, an 11 year old girl who he finds out may be his daughter and may herself suffer from a neurodevelopmental disorder. 

The best superhero film since The Dark Knight. A cut above anything else that's been done with the X-Men franchise. My former favorite, X2, simply does not achieve what Logan does. I actually think in terms of film form, this is better than some of what I've seen of the Academy award contenders. 

The gentle wavering between heartwrenching and heartwarming is something that most films can't do, let alone comic book adaptations, without coming across as corny. What's amazing is just how authentic it all is. It's raw. It's risky. I never thought I'd see a film where Professor X moans at Wolverine for helping him get on the toilet properly. It was a funny moment, in a good way. I never thought I'd see them make the magnificently noble and eloquent Charles Xavier regularly cuss at his old charge, in a state of mental deterioration. It was heartbreaking, in a good way.

Daphne Keen holds her own, both in the fighting  and in the quiet moments between the action. My only rants are that cathartic as it was to see Logan finally granted peace I swear I was hoping for a miracle at the end! I wanted the de facto leader of the kids to be a magnetism mutant like Magneto and rip the adamantium out of his body and watch him heal and then lead the kids into Canada, thereby becoming the next Professor X. And that would have made it a worse movie, but damn if I didn't want it all the same!

deigdmq,"I think that with Deadpool and Logan, Fox has proven that it understands how to make a successful single character movie. You can feel that each of these movies is precisely tailored to fit its character in terms of tone. This isn't something that necessarily shows through Marvel Studios/Disneys solo movies, where it's *somewhat* always the same recipe.

With regards to Logan, great movie which I think will go down as one of the best superhero movies of these recent years. Obviously loved its intensity and frantic action scenes, as you'd expect from Wolverine (got some Fury Road thrills at some point), but also and mosty the story, better than a simple ""save the world"" scenario and much more immersive.

Hugh Jackman & Patrick Stewart, top-notch performances to give these 2 characters a proper send-off. Shout-out to Boyd Holbrook for his interpretation of Donald Pierce, just the right amount of crazy and cunning, without going over the top (Hello Jesse Eisenberg)

We know by now that it's a different movie than the rest. the tone is different, the progression (they're running away from something) which I really liked. The action scenes have more impact for this reason even more so after you've done watching the movie that it wasn't a fun ride like you see in other superhero movies. There's a bit of post-apocalyptic vibe in there throughout (trying to not spoil) kind of like The Road, one of my fav movies. 

If you're a casual non-comicbook lover you'll love it. Don't even need to go to a theatre because you'll enjoy it in your home because of how ""indie"" it looks.

So I thought maybe it didn't take place in that timeline, and it was still part of the original timeline. But that also didn't tie in with the bad future we saw in days of future past.

dem8i71,"Just want to clarify some plot points I might not have got immediately on first viewing.   

- The fact they have Wolverine's blood is following on from the post-credits Apocalypse scene right? They just dumped the Essex Corp from it because Sinister wouldn't have fit in the universe they're trying to create.   

- I got the part about Charles killing everyone at the X-Mansion but wow so every character we knew and the ones we're getting to know from the current reboots are dead and gone. Wouldn't Jean have been strong enough to resist it though? My knowledge of X-Men comic lore isn't the greatest but still. Sucks to know that any future McAvoy/Fassbender films they make will have characters that we already know how they'll die.  

- On that note does the mutant situation presented in this film pretty much confirm that concept of they could change the future but not the outcome? Like they stopped the sentinels from existing but in the process something different came along to wipe out mutants. No matter what way it actually happens, the extinction of mutants is inevitable?

- That samurai sword that he has when he's resting at the hideout, is that from The Wolverine? I noticed it and I was just like ""Wait are they acknowledging that actually happened?""",5x7z96

The fact that it built on that past we've shared with these characters, but told us a story with that foundation in such a grounded way, is really a testamant to what can be accomplished when you are dedicated to telling a story like this in a film.

This film was great not because of the super hero elements... in fact, the heroes in it are far from being super.... it felt like a Science Fiction Drama to me, with of course well shot action scenes... and its a great film because of it.


Logan to me... diverted away from the Super hero genre and it was the best thing Fox did for a while. The dramatic elements really were well written and planned... this is the first film with a comic character I've actually teared up haha.... so touching that 3rd act of the film.

dejhdr4,"This was such a smart, assured film. Aside from the amazing three lead performances, a few of the other things I loved:

1. The original X-Men comics were an allegory for the Civil Rights movement, and the Bryan Singer movies updated that analogy to encompass LGBT rights (""Have you tried *not* being a mutant?""). Logan pretty directly draws a link between mutants and immigrants/refugees - the entire movie is one long border crossing. The X-Men mythology endures because it takes the side of the out-group and the underdog, and Logan continues that legacy.

2. Show, don't tell. Logan avoided both long expositionary sequences and flashbacks, aside from the cell phone video (which felt as organic as that kind of info dump can). That shows a lot of confidence by the filmmaker and trust in the audience.

3. Plot pacing and character development were in sync. Often in movies, characters' development gets accelerated or slowed down in order to meet the demands of the plot. Nothing in Logan feels inorganic or forced - even though the plot pacing hits the beats you'd expect, it does so in a way that doesn't compromise the character beats. ",5x7z96

Hacking off limbs, blood and gore, stabbing in the head; pure awesomeness.  I'm not sure if it's glorifying violence but I really felt it added so much and helped to make this movie great.    

The scene [in the forest at the end when Logan goes full Wolverine was intense and Hugh was perfect](/spoiler).  It made me wonder how we had to wait 17 years for this R rating.   I hope this movie does well (not only because it deserves it) and movie studios take notice.

Would give this movie a 10/10 if not for [the scene where the kids are trying to look tough killing the guy from Narcos.  Reminded me to much of X3 with generic non named mutants whose powers are anyone's guess.  They could have used their powers sooner too.

Wouldn't diet and exercise have been controlled?] (/spoiler)Small things can obviously be found and picked apart in most films.  Regardless, I'm impressed.",5x7z96
deg4byp,"Never would I have ever expected myself to say this, but here goes:

Marvel needs to take notes from Fox.

Prepare yourself, because this is more of a personal rant because I dont have anyone to talk movies with outside of the internet.

For years I have talked about how Fox has done nothing but make inconsistent movies and they should just stop and give the rights to Marvel so that they can fix it and expand their own stories. I was upset with Fox for keeping my childhood heroes from where they should be. Even if they made good movies it still upset me that they were making pretty good/safe movies when Marvel could be doing the same but in the same universe as the Avengers. 

They have never really made anything too amazing other than Deadpool, which I figured was a one time creative thing. The X-Men universe has been all over the place and I figured it was a lost cause and it should just be wrapped up and sold away, because all I really cared about anymore was Deadpool, which can be revived anywhere with no issues, because of his self-awareness. Especially after Apocalypse, which I thought was just a pathetic, soulless film. 

When it comes to comic book movies, I have, and honestly still think that Marvel is on top with their adaptations, and are faithful and do their characters justice, while delivering well made films with heart. I've definitely realized and acknowledged that they are formulaic and too safe, but I love seeing my heroes come to life and interact together on screen and even with formulas, they are still interesting and fun movies. Not until today have I ever thought Fox had any upper hand or that they should keep any rights to anything, especially from Marvel.

Logan has changed my mind. I am a bit too hyped on it at the moment, but even if my excitement for it dwindles, I still think it is probably the highest quality film in the genre since The Dark Knight. I also dont think Marvel has the capability to make such a film. Something I noticed is that visually, every one of their movies looks the same. While the direction may differ, most of their movies are using the same color pallet and just tend to have the same level of ""maturity"" in their movies. They all have mass appeal and dont really take risks. I'm not at all bashing Marvel here, because I do absolutely love their universe and am super excited for their upcoming movies, because they are extremely enjoyable, and I'd consider myself a fanboy.

But Logan is a movie that throws away any form of ""X-Men"" structure and doesnt have to worry about fitting in as a perfect puzzle piece in a planned out universe. It doesnt need to appeal to all ages for the mass market. It doesnt need to be uniform with the rest of the X-Men movies. It is a story about a character, that is crafted to do that character its full justice, while not really bothering with anything else, and it absolutely worked. I loved every minute of it and sadly, I dont know if I'll ever have the same experience with a movie. It took a character that has been in movies since I was born, and after 17 years of ups and downs, gave a proper, emotional conclusion.

I personally think that Fox should stop making X-Men movies, well, no more ""X-Men: Insert Subtitle Here"". I want individual stories about mutants specially fitted thematically to that character. I dont mean every movie should be a dark, Rated R movie, but make everything tailored to the specific character. I think if they can do that, then Fox could truly thrive and achieve something with their properties that Marvel can't, and probably will never be able to do. 

Marvel is great at what they do, but what has happened is that they've made their universe so uniform that its like making a comic universe where every seperate character's own series is still written and illustrated by the same people. Marvel has hit the sweet spot with their films for mass appeal, and will never stretch anywhere else. 

They are very consistently making great movies, but because of that, I don't think they have the possibly of ever having a standout movie that is absolutely exceptional, and truly special, which is exactly what Logan is.",5x7z96

denjrtr,"Can't say it's a great film, but certainly a good one. It suffers from a lot of problems that superhero films often have, generic villains, predictable plot line, development of side characters being too rushed and unnatural, etc.
What I do love about this film is that wolverine, character constructed through almost 20 years of films, gets a perfect emotional pay-off, which makes this film worth watching.

Through all the previous films, we got to know wolverine as a character. He is a person who does not undersand his own emotions, doesn't know how to express them, and intentionally isolates himself from others becasue people too close to him tend to get hurt. However, his personality serves as nothing more than a special character quirk in the previous movies. Wolverine always ends up just doing some cool shit with everyone else anyways, and his personality creates little emotional stake.

So it is satisfying to see that his emotions are what drives the plot progression in Logan. The character development in Logan adds a new dimension to his character, and he becomes complicated and interesting for analysis. Through the film, Logan slowly comes to a self realization, that what he truly wants is a sense of belonging, which he has always been neglecting by isolating himself. [The fact that he is able to die after he realizes that he has a family that lives on is a great emotional pay-off to his character. He realizes that what he has been looking for in life has been fulfilled. He gets the ending that he deserves.
Also, I feel like I should address the young version of wolverine that they have to fight off at the end. I thought the young wolverine was kind of stupid (in fact I still do), but I have to admit that defeating young wolverine serves some thematic significance too. Maybe I'm overthinking this, but the old, weak version of Wolverine, along with his daughter, defeats his younger, more energetic self, symbolizes that the sense of belonging and family wins over physical strength, suggesting that it is really the former that Logan seeks. The young wolverine is still kind of stupid though.](#spoiler)

My favorite scene is when [after Logan buries Xavier and his truck breaks down, he turns into this furious rage and smashes the truck into pieces. As I said, Logan cannot understand and express his own emotions that well. While he is experiencing strong sadness over someone who has brought him company and purpose in life, the only intense emotion that he is able to express is anger. My thought watching that scene was that he really is not able to communicate his emotions to others, which is why he is so lonely in the first place.](#spoiler)",5x7z96

des6zoz,"got a question for some of you nerds (first off, I really loved the movie, I have no personal complaints, but any rant I come up with raving on about the movie has probably already been said)

How would the lot of you explain how Stryker's .44 Magnum (Ruger Redhawk, THANKS IMFDB) only did a little bit of damage to Wolvie's thick adamantium skull and caused memory loss, but the .357 Laura uses (Smith & Wesson Model 386, ""Nightguard"", THANKS AGAIN IMFDB) to blow off X-24's head...blows off most of X-24's head? 


Did the adamantium in Logan's body actually detoriate over time? As far as the movie seemed to explain, the adamantium only poisoned his body over the course of time, causing his healing factor to get worse. Even so that doesn't make a lot of sense does it? Logan isn't the one in question here, X-24 is fresh, if anything, that bullet should've been like a BB Gun aimed at a metal post.

Perhaps X-24 was made with a lower grade of Adamantium? If this were True, wouldn't Logan's claws have sheered through X-24's? even [Old Man Logan](https://media.tenor.co/images/116d2a21c4a814f4bc959851c99af83b/tenor.gif) could still kick X-24's ass if the adamantium in its body was a lower quality form. 

Is it a game of physics? The angle? The Distance? Would Wolvie's leap towards Stryker not actually make the .44 bullet even more damaging? 

Or are we just sweeping this one under the rug (which I'm fine with), and blaming it on terrible writing for Origins?

Specifically, about slave's kids at the time, who would be born as a 'property'

Think about it, they move from the south border (well, south side of the border but we get to see that they come into Texas) to the north,

Canada's considered ""safe haven"" and that everything will be fine after they cross the border,

Children plan to split up and then gather after near the north border to cross it together,

They are hunted by people who raised them to work for them, even bluntly calls them things or properties in one point? I'm not sure of property but they are definitely called things by Rice,

During the journey they start meeting people that sympathize and try to help them like that doctor, 

How children seem helpless at first and we sit through them running away from hunters before they retaliate,

Only problem with this analogy is that south of the border thing but they made it very clear that the lab is American.

So what do you guys think?

dejll4p,"Saw the movie last night. While I definitely liked it a lot, I was glad when it was over. Though still good, there were points in the film where it felt like it dragged and it was becoming a little exhausting to continue watching. I was a little bummed that I had these feelings as I left the theater, as I was expecting to like it a bit more. 

However, as the day goes on, I love it more and more, and the feeling I had as I left the theater was undoubtedly what I should have been feeling. 

Make no mistake - this is not a fun movie. While many of the action set pieces are absurdly entertaining, the film as a whole is a miserable experience in the best kind of way. It's extremely depressing while offering just the right amount of hope. It's not something you can just jump into - you need to be in a specific state of mind in order to truly get anything out of the film. 

Despite me being the same guy who made an entire thread a few days ago about never seeing an X-Men movie, I really didn't need to see any to appreciate the film. 

As many have said, the ending is what really got me - it's a complete mix of emotions. I don't know whether to feel happy or sad, and that's exactly how it should be.

Despite a few very minor issues (mainly the entire X-24 subplot), this is an extraordinary film, and very much on par with The Dark Knight, which I consider to be one of my personal favorites of all time. ",5x7z96

Since it's danced around what exactly has happened in the past of the characters of this movie, my feeling is this film isn't exactly part of the continuity of the other movies. The X-Men movies we've seen up until now have all been ""based off"" the comics in this movie. Since Logan says ""maybe a quarter of it happened, but not like this"", I kinda liked the idea that yeah, maybe there was a fight at the statue of liberty at one point, but he didn't actually battle on top of it or spin around and cut off a piece of it when fighting Sabretooth. So really all the movies were just exaggerated stories of the more low-key adventures that Wolverine had when he was part of the X-Men.

So with Wolverine and the slow decline in his healing eventually leading to his death at the end. We've got a few pieces of information about the world they are living in that I base my theory on. First, most mass produced food has been co-opted to secretly deliver gene therapy to humans to prevent mutations from occurring. Second, mutants are no longer being born and despite the population levels seen in previous movies are now basically unheard of.

On the second point, there are implications that something happened to cause a fair number of mutant deaths (being hunted down, coerced into the military, fighting among themselves, etc), but one thought that I had is the possibility that those same gene therapies likely had effects on adult mutants as well. Slowly over time weakening their powers/abilities. Possibly itself leading to health complications of the mutant in question.

Given my theory, what I think was going on with Wolverine was that through the combination of this constant ""corrective"" gene therapy as well as his alcohol heavy diet resulted in the slow decline of his healing factor. In short, his body was spending just as much time fighting itself as it was wounds, made even worse by alcohols general effects on organ performance. Assuming that adamantium (I thought it was adamantine?) is actually somewhat toxic to the human body, what this could mean is that while everything is in perfect working order for Logan, his healing factor was able to easily correct the damage caused by the toxicity of the metal. However, when you take into account my thoughts on the lowered performance of his healing factor, this results in a fairly lethal combination.

Yes, it's just a movie, but it is still fun to analyze.

tldr: I think Logan's health issues were caused as much by (if not more than) the gene therapy in all the food than the poisoning of his metal bones.",5x7z96

Granted, they get credit for going in a very different direction, deviating from ""somehow, through the power of his friends/convictions/inner growth, he overcomes"", but the inclusion of X-24 even as a setup for that deviation made me roll my eyes a bit; I had a sort of eye-rolling ""oh, of course there's one of these, it's a superhero movie.""

deg7tku,"Phenomenal movie. It was a perfect send off for our beloved wolverine and professor X. The ending left me in tears. 

Also, as Logan was passing and the camera pans to the kids, I definitely got a future x-men vibe.

On a side note, the ending is a little bleak, no? Obviously Transigen, the company making the mutants is still around and kicking, and I doubt their loss at the end is going to stop them from making more wolverine clones and other mutants unless I missed something.

Overall, beautiful movie and this is definitely my favorite superhero film now. 9/10",5x7z96

deg9vlv,"I went to the first lunchtime showing in London on Wednesday and based on the trailers I was cautiously optimistic.  Mentioning no names but let's be honest, sometimes a great trailer hides a real stinker.

In this case, a good trailer hid a movie for the ages. What a ride. I clapped, I cheered, I got choked up and I was emotionally drained by the end of it and so were the other people coming out of the cinema afterwards.

Having followed these characters in the comics for years it was amazing to see them on screen like this. Jackman and Stewart deliver performances that would be great in any movie and the rest of the cast is on fine form too, especially Dafne Keen as wide-eyed, silent and rage-filled X-23.

The opening scene basically shows you this is not the PG-13 Wolverine we're used to and it is glorious. The action opens with an intensity last seen in the Raid movies. I can't fault the pacing and even though it's a long film, it never outstays its welcome (something I always felt detracted a little from that other epic, The Dark Knight). 

It looks like this is the last time Jackman and Stewart will be playing these characters and if that really is the case then I cannot imagine a better send off.

9.5/10 for me and it resets the bar in terms of what you can do with comic book properties in the movies.

They said in the movie they can't do anything of they make it across the border. Why?

Was terrified when I learned a kid was going to be a major character but she owned the role and hopefully there's more from her as the character in the future (maybe doubtful but would be nice). They could've delved further into what happened up to the start of the movie but it's not a major problem for me, sometimes they add too much exposition and completely fucked with the story they were telling (plus I have a theory below that I have on the subject). 9/10, maybe would've liked more with the big 3 and a little less of chauffeur Logan but oh well.

**The only things I knew about this movie going in was from watching the trailers. So I had no idea who the girl was supposed to be playing but during the second trailer maybe, Xavier told Logan he knew who she was, I guessed that she must've been his daughter or something. (Has nothing to do with the movie I just want to boast.)**

Heres the theory for the story: The thing that came to me after learning that Legion is a part of the X-Men movieverse is that the plot of the show is going to lead into what happen in this movie. I haven't seen the show at all so I don't know how close this may be but I've seen a lot of talk on this thread about how the movie didn't explain enough of what's happened between DoFP and Logan, so maybe Legion will answer those questions.",5x7z96

- I originally was wondering why transigen would even care that the kids escape to canada when they aren't interested in that experiment anymore (now they are focused on x-24), and the explanation I can see is that they don't want a force of mutants capable of fighting them out in the world.

Overall though, great movie. Like, holy shit. When I finished it, my eyes were swelled up, and I was practically straight up sobbing. Great acting by everyone.

degia2v,"Here's the review I wrote on my FaceBook movie group:

So went to see this tonight and wasn't in any way disappointed (other than by the fan boys who got a little too excited at some bits, but that's fine). I've not thought much of the Wolverine films, kinda felt like they were cashing in on the franchise and didn't have nearly the same investment as the X-Men flagships, but Logan really is Jackman taking this character for his own, but as a film it couldn't be further from the X-Men movies.

In fact it couldn't be further from most any superhero movie. I know some have compared it to Deadpool but, other than Deadpool making a weird appearance in the first Wolverine movie, I do not have a clue why that comparison is being made. Don't expect any zany quips here. In fact, don't expect any Superhero staples here at all. The action is tempered and small scale. Logan is not a powerhouse and unstoppable force. There is no fancy gadgets, blackbird planes, zappy powers or WhizzBangs. The mutants in this all have powers that are pretty lame all in all. I think it's fair to say in fact that this is a modern western redemption story on a very small scale in a tiny corner of America... and for all of this I think the film is an utter triumph.

Prof X's decay into senility is brilliantly done by Patrick Stewart. I know that interesting things have been done with that character with McEvoy, but he has never been this tragic. Logan is too broken, not only physically, but also emotionally. He is a man who seems to have utterly given up and Jackman does an amazing job of injecting massive amount of pathos into the character. The new comer, Laura, is great. Buzzing with anger and a slight weirdness that really suits the characters arc and I think Dafne Keen is going to be a name we're going to be hearing a lot more of. In fact, if you have seen the trailer, Hurt is the perfect song for of all these characters, and thinking about it, this film could easily have been simply about a man with a terminal disease trying to care for his aging and senile father and his traumatised daughter but knowing that he won't be around for them for long.

This is easily the saddest, hardest to watch superhero movie. It's not going to be one you'll kick on to get your through your hangover. It's melancholic, tragic, horrific, ultra violent in a disturbingly real way and genuinely touching. Think more The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Unforgiven, or The Proposition than any of the X-Men franchise. If you are someone who doesn't like the current run of superhero films, this may be the one for you.

deki89c,"Honestly, this movie was perfect start to finish. Amazing acting from Hugh, you can literally feel how jaded and bitter he is after all he has been through. You can see his body literally giving up on him. The contrast with X-24 was just stunning. I don't know who the double was but they must have spent ages perfecting their movements. Props to the make up team too, he looked significantly younger as X-24 too, similar to his first appearance. He really stopped aging around 2008.

The exploration of Logan's relationship with Charles was superb. It's very refreshing to see them as equals, which they are - it often feels like they forget that Logan is older than Charles and Erik combined and treat his like a child. ""I always know you, I just sometimes don't recognise you"" is such an amazing line - it's not just about Charles' memory loss, it's about Logan the person. The movie was missing its usual no stakes, funny scenes that they usually have. Here all you can feel is existential dread. It's not Batman like *man pain*, it's literal anguish. I feel that way it's similar to The Winter Soldier, where you feel like the characters are pushing through not for themselves but for other people. You don't see the quipping dude who lights cigars from car fires, you see a man who has seen too much. A thousand million yards stare.

I also loved the ""it wasn't me"" scene after 24 stabbed Charles. It's such a small moment but it felt so poignant. Logan wanted Charles to know that even if he himself felt like a burden, he would carry him no matter what because Charles carried him when he needed it. I was so glad Logan got to him before he died because I feel like he would have killed himself right then and there if he hadn't. **It's a crying shame that none of these amazing actors will get an Oscar nomination for their roles.**

X-23 was amazing too. I have very low expectations for child actors in serious films because they usually suck as mean as this sounds but she was breathtaking. As much as I wanted a happy ending, I liked that they kept it vague as to what happened with the other mutants and if the kids made it to the safe haven. ",5x7z96

He's not a nasty man. Not a villain who wants to murder everybody for the sake of being evil, not someone who guns down puppies for fun, and not someone who wants to take over the world.

He's just a guy working for some not-very-nice people who has to do deadly things to get the job done. Even when he threatened Caliban, you never got the explicit sense that he was some sadist who wanted to see everybody burn in hell. He just had a job to do, and he'd may as well have fun doing it.

The smartass bickering he had with everyone, even almost flirting with Logan, added a lot more to him than the average superhero movie villain. Hell, even when Charles had the seizure at the hotel, he looked genuinely angry to see so many innocent people being hurt, and just wanted things to end. 

All he cared about was getting Laura, and even if his faceless goons were deadset on shooting everybody in sight, he seemed like a decent guy who occasionally had to do some bad things because it's what he's paid to do.

Logan never learned to cope with the loss of a friend or a broken heart, he does it the only way he knows, violance, violance, violance. That's Logan mourning, while physically in agony.

degcyl2,"Thought i'd give some thoughts from someone who hasn't watched many X-men films. Thought the movie was very good. There was good characterisation throughout, with great performances from both Jackman and Stewart. I was also impressed with Laura. I thought the director decided to have her not talk throughout the first half because she wasn't a good actor, but she really gave some of the final scenes their emotional impact and her delivery was quite good.

Mainly I liked how human and grounded  this film felt. Even with wolverine jumping around stabbing people, i was easily immersed in the world and found myself relating to the characters and their plight. Recent superhero movies (suicide squad, recent superman films) never made me feel this way because of how outlandish their plots were and how the movies failed to have any convincing characters. It was nice to have a director who realised we dont need massively high 'the world is doomed without us' stakes to be able to make the audience care about what's happening. I also liked how this film slowed down a lot, to give more time to flesh out the relationships and develop the dynamics between the characters.

Technically the film was well made. It sounded great (expecting sound editing and mixing nominations) and there was some great fight choreography, particularly the finale that had some beautiful long tracking shots of Wolverine that reminded me of the Fellowship of the Rings final fight in some ways. I also thought there were some lovely panning shots in the film, and I kinda wish the director used more of them

Things I didn't like was the way the ending was set up, as I felt it kinda fell into the old superhero formula 'need to have a big action scene' ending, when it could have been something more special or unique. I understand that everything needed to be tied up but I saw what was going to happen a mile away. I also thought the main antagonists lacked motivation or development, as I wasn't sure what they were trying to accomplish with the kids or why they were such cunts to everyone they encountered in the film. However this may be based in the wider universe so I'm not sure. There were also some weird choices throughout the film in how the story was told, which at some points pulled me out of the film. 

Overall, it was an enjoyable film and there was a lot I liked. If I had to give it a number I'd probably give it a strong 7 out of 10.    ",5x7z96

Logan was an adult, but she's prepubescent, and this is the strongest metal in the world. You would think that those claws (her whole skeleton, actually) would normally enlarge and grow in length, at least into Laura's teens. But with that steel coating them, they're just going to be stunted at that size, forever - not to mention she's going to be incredible pain, for a long time. It's like Chinese foot-binding. And because of the healing factor, they're never going to ""settle"" - her skeletal structure's always going to be attempting to push outwards and mature, making shit hurt even worse.

I liked that it wasn't ""the world is ending and only these people can stop it"" like so many superhero movies are, but the plot itself felt a bit contrived. Logan's / ProfX / Caliban's backstory made sense to me, but the X project itself is what I had trouble with. 

They were breeding these fighting machines in a facility that had less physical security than a dog pound. Yea they had some muscle but why was this facility *less* secure than Stryker's facility out in the middle of nowhere under a dam with steel reinforced vault-door style walls, which proved to be not secure enough? 

Also near the end of the movie we see the kids all running through the forest. Why didn't the guards just shoot the kids? The order was to take them alive or dead. After my 3rd buddy got ripped apart by tree bark if I were being paid to take someone alive or dead, I'd start shooting. I get that we can't show a movie where a bunch of hired hands gun down kids (though one flesh wound to the shoulder of the oldest is OK), but it just felt a little contrived. 

Also why the fuck is their lead scientist in the field? Clearly the government has spent billions on this. It'd be like sending the head of Boeing to capture Osama Bin Laden because he helped design the tools.

dejzhcr,"Hi Reddit people!

For starters, I thought this movie was excellent. Not just as a superhero movie, but in general. One of the best I'd seen in recent memory. However, I have some questions after viewing Logan that I'd love to have some information on. 

1. What did Professor X do to be on the run? Did he kill all the existing mutants (except Logan and Caliban, of course)? I believe this was alluded to when he wakes up crying in the farm house.

2. Why was Logan not healing? Logan mentions the adamantium was likely poisoning him - anyone have insights on this? 

3.  What is the extent of Logan's healing powers? Is this explained in the comics? Clearly we see that an adamantium bullet to the head kills him but wouldn't it regenerate?  
       A. Why would being impaled on a log kill him when he seemed to take equally severe injuries before?
       B. Did taking the green medicine all at once weaken him and make him more susceptible to dying?

4. Could I get a little more background information on the Dr. Rice guy and the Transigen project: Why did he create the children as experiments again? I think they said they wanted to use them as weapons for war? What did the green serum do? Why did Dr. Rice care so much that the children be killed off? Why did he make a soulless Wolverine? 

5. How did all those children get to and find that secluded fortress? What happened to all the adults that brought them? 

6. Would the children actually be safe after crossing the border? Why? 

7. Are we supposed to assume all the previous X-Men/ Wolverine movies are in the same universe? 

8. I read that there was a theory about Dr. Rice suppressing the mutant genes through the water supply? Perhaps it was related to the corn syrup the farmer mentioned? Does anyone have an explanation for this? 

9. Did they make an adamantium skeleton for Laura or was it just her claws? Wouldn't having it as her skeleton stunt her grown?

Disappointed with a few things: the villain(s), the offhand radio comment about what happened to the X-Men rather than a scene showing us (would add more emotional impact) and I know this movie has nothing to do with the graphic novel but I preferred that story's version of what happened to the X-men, and am I the only one bothered by their blatant disregard at how much danger they were putting that family in and how fucked it was to stay?

That aside, every X-Men movie has its problems really, and this one probably cracks my top 3. Easily the best of the standalone Wolverine movies but that's really not saying much.

So again, I enjoyed this movie but I came in hearing about how it's now the best comic book movie, and while it's a good movie, it's not even close.

Logan, Charles and Calibal all had terrific eye-makeup. Bloodshot, cloudy, and just haggered looking eyes. I couldn't get over how well done it looked.

Compliments aside, I've got a bunch of questions to ask.

1. Why would an adamantium bullet kill X-24? How does it stop his healing factor?

2. In relation to my first point, did it even kill X-24? After Logan gets stumped and is on his deathbed, they switch to a wide shot, and there's no corpse. Did X-24 heal and run off into the woods, now memoryless, ready to start the x-men story all over again?

3. During Laura's fight with X-24, she landed hits on one if his ribs twice in succession, but produced two completely different sounds. Am i meant to believe this is some sort of magic rib? I sure hope somebody got fired over that blunder.

4. More of a grey area, this time. If Charles were to bodyswap, like he did at the end of X3, would he keep his degenerative disease or be cured of it?

5. Are we sure it's not just Dark Phoenix in Charles' brain causing the seizures? What if he imprisoned her in his mind and this is the result of that?

dhiav8m,"I am going to go against the prevailing sentiment and judge this movie ""not good"". Performances are mostly strong (not sure I feel that wayabout Patrick Stewart) but the plot is convoluted and choppy, hard tofollow, and the ultimate ending is massively disappointing. It starts well enough with previous characters having fallen on hard times but like the 2013 Wolverine movie it descends into an utterly ridiculous plot which i'm not sure I can even describe here - suffice it to say(#SPOILERS) that the last 1/3 is like watching MadMax Beyond Thunderdome with kids living in a treehouse before trying to make it across the border (Canadian) to a rumored Eden. It is hyper violent which would
not be a problem except the movie introduces lots of sympathetic
characters - kids (lots), families, maternal types, then kills most of them in disturbing ways with little rhyme or reason. We once again getan endless supply of gov't mercenaries as the meaningless bad guys then kill them one by one with lots of killing being done by a banshee-like screaming child.

- Laura's mother was somehow able to assemble a beautifully edited video about the mutants, complete with footage she shouldn't have been able to access at all... Why was she recording footage of her rescuing the kids even? — I think everything would have made sense without that video and it reminded me very much of the quicktime videos in BvS.

- Did anyone else get a real bad X-Men Origins vibe with the bad guy and turn at the second half? The Wolverine clone being the big bad guy reveal felt *very* Faux-Deadpool... And the fight was even somewhat similar, ending with Wolverine getting shot in the head even.

I think that it was a cool movie though, a nice change in pace until the third act. The cursing was a bit errr... excessive... seems like they just said 'fuck' all over where they never really cursed in the past movies so it stood out now that it's like every next word.

Some moments of botchy CG here and there but nothing substantially distracting.

I think I would have loved to see the movie live up to the promise of a mature resolution versus an all out Marvelized fight at the end, and the kids (err.. the ""Mex-Men""?) fighting at the end was sort of cringy.

deg2mi7,"I, like many of you, grew up watching Jackman. For me, he IS Wolverine. I loved every single one of his performances. He is to Wolverine what Robert Downey Jr. is to Iron Man. In my book, no one will be able to replace him, and as such, I wish his character gets this wonderful send off, and have it last for a while.

Onto the movie. I loved it. Not a single scene wasted, or a single dialogue forced, or a single shot dragged on. Everything felt so grounded, so real, so sad. Truly, you could smell the blood and iron in the atmosphere, and you felt how tired Logan was. 

I found it a nice touch how he went on calling himself his original name, James Howlett. There were so many small touches, that really made this world feel so real and tragic. 

After all the work they've done, all the tragedies, all the struggles, if it's not one bad guy it's another, these mutants can NOT get a break, and that truly stabs at your feelings. I have no idea what Charles felt in those last moments. He tried to show humanity a better way, yet in the end, Erik (Magneto) was right. 

When he took all the medicine, I knew this was it. His last stand. And what a battle it was. His and Laura's combos and how fluid all the fighting was. How gorey everything was. Even the cursing and language, all of it was necessary, because it built up a much more believable world. 

And of course, the ending. The death of the family mirrored the death of the farmer couple from X-Men Origins Wolverine movie. I think I saw the Katana from The Wolverine, and of course the death of Charles. 

I waited, and waited and waited. When Logan said ""so that's what that felt like,"" tears ensued. Hardcore crying. And the speech from the western movie that was given, and finally when Laura turned the cross into an X. 

I waited and was praying we would hear the snikt, maybe see him come back, but the ending was tasteful. We followed Wolverine from the first X-Men movie. We saw the world how he saw it, and with this, we see the ending.

I cried. I cried and cried and cried. 

And I'm going to see this again. It deserves all the praise it's getting. It was a beautifully shot, beautifully written, and beautifully executed movie. It still hasn't sank in yet. I was in elementary school, or even in kindergarten when I started my journey with Logan, and now it ends here, and I'm about to graduate college.

Also, I LOVED the cute chubby ""Static Shock"" kid. 

I hope to see more of these grounded and amazingly thought out movies. It sucked to see Wolverine's movies get such flack, I enjoyed them all. But I'm very happy to see him get such a beautiful send off.

It still hasn't sunk in man. These feels be too much for me man. ",5x7z96
deg43yz,"The main villain was a little annoying. There was nothing interesting about him. Just some cocky ex military guy with a metal hand running around, thinking he is some hot shit, surving through the movie undeservingly in a typical villain manner, only to be killed off by the kids in the end without ever achieving anything significant.

Other than that the movie was pretty good

deg6jjg,"10/10 for me personally. I absolutely loved everything about this movie. I'm still on a bit of a high from it so I need to give it a little more time, but this might be my favorite super hero movie.

Also I'm so happy to see that they finally 100% nailed Wolverine. Which I'm not saying he hasn't been great before. But I feel that wolverine solo movies suffer from the same issue Superman runs into. 

They are so unbeatable that even though you love the character it can be difficult to root for them within the movie as you always know they are going to come out on top. They were somewhat successful in the last Wolverine but you always knew he was getting his powers back plus you want to see him with his powers so him not having them ruined the movie a little for me.

But this movie he was so vulnerable throughout.  It made it feel like there was a chance he could actually fail. There was a chance at really any given time that he could die and I loved that he slowly stopped healing. The acting in this one was also top notch.

I'll also leave with saying I laughed my ass off when she finally spoke and he was soooo excited at first and then it quickly turned into him telling her to ""shut the fuck up""

The trailer makes it seem more gritty and emotional than the actual movie which dissapointed me a bit.

I feel like the ending could have been better too, more of a ""sacrificing"" himself to save the future of mutants or something like that, which it was but it was kinda an anticlimatic ending.

Still a great movie tho and i'm going to miss the wolverine

Apart from the whole ending the hotel scene where Logan gets angry at Laura over how the comics got the information wrong was just beautiful.

And not to be ""that guy"" but I felt a small connection to the last of us, probably a huge coincidence. But the hotel scene did remind me a but of the farm house scene in last of us.

Pretty good acting all around, even the kids, especially Keen.  I hope that this 'trend' of R rated comic movies continues after studios see that this is not a detriment to sales.

You'd think that if they were making soldiers, they would've given some of those kids a better super power than 'grass tentacles'.

Sad, that tigers are extinct.

dej4g57,"The one thing I would like to figure out is exactly what was killing him.  Now before you say ""adamantium obviously"", hear me out.

The following dialogs that I remember show something else.

*  when he was in that doctors office where he stated he knew what was killing him, which could be something was either implanted in him or something else.

*  When he was on that road trip with his daughter, where she says that she knews he wants to die because he refuses to get help to fix his condition.


* When they were at the base camp and that adamantium bullet was being discussed with his daughter that he states that the adamantium could be what is killing them.  Key thing is could be.

* When he states to the current doctor running that mutant factory that his father was the one who put that poison in him, I interpreted that as maybe that the adamantium was the reason why he couldn't just die as easily and that it took way more to kill him.


The first point in my opinion gets re-enforced more back in The Wolverine when that weird parasitic machine was implanted in him that did screw with him being able to heal properly.

So, in my opinion based on the above, it is within the realm of possibility that something could be engineered that he couldn't easily get out that he was aware of but didn't want to share it with anyone because he had a death wish.

I could also have forgotten some important dialog within the movie that completely destroys this interpretation.",5x7z96

I haven't seen ""R"" movies in theaters before, so it was unusual to watch claws going through bad guys' heads (and titties too). 

Dafne Keen is such a great cast choice. I believe she has a bright acting future.
The ending was a bit dissappointing for a movie like that, I expected some more emotional touches, just a bit.
What I liked the most was that I didn't see actors - I saw characters and that means a lot. 

I saw they replaced real actors with CGI in a couple of scenes, but I only noticed it once when [Laura was escaping on top of the limo which looked a bit unnatural. Also X-24 looked a bit odd, probably due to cgi but it even contributed to his creepiness.](#spoiler) 

But a few things weren't quite logical:

[- Why were the kids waiting just a dozen kilometers away from the border? Why didn't they just leave a guy or two waiting for Logan and Laura while others fleeing already to a safer place? They even had quite a set of abilities to confront soldiers, in order not to attack, but at least to defend themselves.](#spoiler)

I assumed this was either it's own oneshot verse in one like the original X-Men series + Wolverine or simply a continuation of that one somehow. My pal said it was after the good ending of DOFP however, which makes even less sense to me. There was a line about mutants not being born for several years in the film, I believe ~20, so it couldn't be 6 years after DOFP's good ending with fresh students going to the school. Plus that makes sense for [Xander Rice (?) to have program after the eradication of mutants to create his own, there would need to be time in between as the kids are all around 8-14ish.](#spoiler)

The story and progression as the movie went on did absolutely nothing for me though. About an hour and a half into the movie (Just after the farm/corn scene) I just said ""Where the hell is this story going."" It was aimless at times, and super-predictable at others [(Don't take this all at once = HOLY SHIT YOU'RE GONNA TAKE IT ALL AT ONCE IN THE NEXT 30 SECONDS)](#spoiler)

I think crying but saying nothing would've been better. Just a poweful, dialogue-less moment.

I didn't think it was a bad scene at all. Actually it's the opposite of that, the kid's acting in that part was like the cherry on top of an overall great job. It's just that maybe a simple ""papa"" would've sufficed. It'd have made a great scene even better.",5x7z96

At what point in the movie canon did he figure out his birth name?

I feel bad for any newcomers trying to make sense of his backstory if this was their first X-Men film.

Maybe it's just because I heard that this was loosely based on Old Man Logan but I felt the trailers made it feel like this was set in a post-apocalyptic world so I pictured more of a setting similar to BvS' future. The world seems like normal though aside from the first 15 minutes. Probably safer really without not much more mutants left too. Or maybe not because those automated trucks seem very accident prone. 

I've gathered that this isn't part of the main timeline. I like the MCU but it'd also be cool if everyone just goes this route once in a while.  Just take an interesting story and run with it. No worrying about continuity in the cinematic universe stuff.",5x7z96

deg7c5m,"I didn't like the movie.

The trailers made it way too obvious both Xavier and Wolverine are going to die in this movie (save Hurt by Johnny Cash for the credits, not for the debut trailer) and they do nothing to make it any less apparent at the start of the movie.  

The writers just didn't appear to give a shit after the first half.  Logan and Charles being ""the old cowboys who don't have anything to live for until now"" instead of ""superheroes who are grim and brooding because their lives are a constant maelstrom of pain"" is a great choice.  That said, grumpy old men aren't enough to carry a movie on them alone (The main trio do a great job of acting).  

Evil guy 1 and Evil guy 2 aren't memorable, unique, or even threatening.  If anything, their appearance makes the movie more annoying.  These are characters with a lot of baggage, personality, and even heart, they don't need action to make a good movie. 

The action starts off just like everybody hoped it would be, disgusting, gorey, visceral.  The subsequent action scenes do nothing to change the formula from Wolverine slices and dices and gets shot at, and Laura goes apeshit.   

Then comes the family part.  This is the part where we go from a strong character movie to FOX telling the audience ""I hope you had your fun because we're going back to your regularly scheduled superhero programming"".  I think they planned for the family's son to be about Laura's age, it would explain why she acted so strange around him.  They probably changed his age because he gets butchered.  Evil Wolverine is stupid, there are a million better ways to depict Logan's internal struggle, I already covered how bad the villains are.

After Xavier dies, Laura just starts talking now.  Instead of an explanation, we get angry Spanish, almost like we're not supposed to care.  Laura brings nothing to the dynamic that Charles didn't, almost like they only killed him off because this movie is supposed to be sad and ""main character dies"" is easy to check off a list.  

All of this sums up to an underwhelming climax.  Logan turning his back on the kids saying ""I never asked for this"" feels like a regression of his character at that point, and comes out of nowhere.  The bad guys show up and continue to be bad guys, and Logan has to use some science juice to keep going.  We've already seen Wolverine mass murder dozens of these armed men before, and he just had 2 days of constant rest and no fighting.  He should be rearing to go, but no it's time for suicidal roid rage.  This feels like a way to ass pull his death later on.  Instead of the adamantium bullet that was metioned twice, it has to get used on evil Wolverine, leaving Logan to just kind of bleed to death.  The action isn't even any bigger or better than it was back in the refinery or even the roadstop leading up to his death.

I couldn't see the movie for anything more than an attempt to make a sad cowboy movie that couldn't even do that right before going back to the tired old formula of your normal superhero movie.

For fifteen years I watched Hugh Jackman take bullets, knives, arrows, spikes, pipes, swords, etc. and just keep going.

It went beyond the physical identity of his powers, it spoke to the reliability and trust in his character. Obviously being the single most consistent element of the X-men franchise.  

And to see him old and sick, being utterly *butchered* by a younger version of himself, hopelessly trying to retain the viciousness of his youth...it was some of the most uncomfortable minutes I've ever had in a movie theater. X24 is one of my most hated characters in film, ever, simply because of those scenes.

I loved the blood. Finally, after 17 years, we finally see what those claws can really do (and hey we got to see boobs too)

Charles' speech before his death was truly tragic, as was Logans reaction. Also, when Laura adjusts the cross to an X....Dam here come the weepies. 

The ONE thing that would have been cool...When they get to Eden, I wanted Rogue to be running the show. Would have loved to see a reunion between Hugh and Anna, going back to where it began, and then Rogue leading the kids off into Canada. I know they hinted at her death with the comics but still.

deijcg9,"I really enjoyed this film. It's probably one of the best comicbook movies out there! It's a great send-off to Hugh Jackman.

I'm confused by just two things from the film:

The adamantium bullet is probably the bigger of my two confusions. Somehow, the because the bullet is made of adamantium, it just outright kills someone with wolverine's healing factor? I thought the whole deal with the bullet was that it was meant to pierce Logan's adamantium skull, become lodged inside the brain, and remain there in a way that keeps Logan from healing the wound. X-24 didn't seem to have an adamantium skeleton like Logan, so the the material of the bullet wouldn't need to be made from the super hard metal. The bullet also completely passes through X-24's head, killing him. We know that just the presence of adamantium in the body doesn't kill Logan outright. It slowly kills him through it leeching toxicity into his body and is therefore not an instant death like X-24's. I just don't quite understand what the bullet did that was any different than a regular bullet.

Also, I thought it was odd that in the hotel scene, Charles is freezing the Reaver team attacking him and Laura during his seizure. How was Charles still affecting the Reaver's after they were killed by Wolverine? Shouldn't they have fallen to the ground the moment their brains were fataly damaged?

Needless to say this movie is made and written by characters who love the Wolverine, especially Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The action was fantastic, the acting from everyone was really good, the story was simple by the character interaction elevated the story. If compared to the other Wolverine movies this one felt like a drama with action included. From what I know the girl who played Laura debuted in this film, so for new young actress I think she is great. The movie is full of great moments. This is probably my fav interpretation of Charles Xavier and feels a lot like my grandpa, which I loved. 

The only negatives I have are that the pacing is bit off when transitioning between the 2nd and 3rd act. The villain while intimidating was forgettable. 

At the end this the best Wolverine movie, one of the best X-Men films and Marvel's films.

So they had to kill him off so Wolvy would be forced to go with Laura with Charles dead and nothing holding him back. I don;t blame the writers. I would have probably done the same thing as I don't see how realistically Charles could fit into the finale, He was too powerful however his death felt like it only happened to move the story forward but at the same time it works but it just felt kinda sudden maybe its just me but it did feel a little anti climatic and that he was only used as a plot device

1.) Those kids were basically useless despite being engineered to be Billy-Badasses. I expected them to rally around Logan to fight off their attackers - but I think the way it was written is a little more grounded because they're frightened children. So I can give this one a pass, despite how much bullshit it was that a dozen of them all killed the same regular guy while Laura and Logan fought off X-24. 

2.) Professor-X was not a good character in this film. I understand that a large part of the premise was his diminished capacity, however there were things that he said in near-total lucidity that were just awful and decisions he influenced Logan to make that were questionable and made no sense...calling Logan a disappointment, despite how many times he saved the world and how he was the only one still there for the Professor was chief among them in my eyes, but also getting involved with that family and sending Logan (their primary protector) away from them were also horrible. 

3.) Logan also made very poor decisions at the expense of others. He assaulted those guys after trespassing on their land, knowing fully well that there would be repercussions to the farmer and his family as a result that he likely wouldn't be around to protect them from.

4.) Why did it take the corporation several days to get to Eden? You're telling me that in 2029, it would take an extremely wealthy corporation over 4 days to mobilize to EXACT coordinates? There was no more looking. They knew where to go. A forced inconsistency to give Logan time to recuperate. 

5.) What the fuck is going to happen to those kids? They're engineered killing machines - is the Canadian government just going to put them in a foster system, or are they pretty much going to put them back into a similar observatory to the one they just escaped from as a necessary precaution? My money is on the latter. Also, why the hell would they trust some random voice on a radio? It could have been their captors posing as the Canadian government. 

I wasn't satisfied with the ending. It actually kind of ruined the whole series for me - I can't go back now and watch any of the X-Men films without seeing Professor X and Logan and thinking, ""man, you die in really pathetic ways at the hands of a younger, better version of Logan after Professor X accidentally murders everyone else in these movies."" 

I think it would have been much better if Charles made it to Eden with them and had another, more powerful seizure during the final battle which killed much of the Transigen forces and severely crippled X-24, who stops the seizure by killing Charles. This way he dies with one last heroic measure, a small act towards redemption after his incident a year earlier, instead of a regretful old man in his sleep immediately after remembering the fact that he accidentally killed everyone he loved. 

The disoriented X-24 is still weakened by the seizure, although still stronger than Logan and healing rapidly. At THIS point Logan uses the serum to even out the playing field and fights X-24 on nearly-equal footing while Laura and the kids rally to finish off the Transigen forces. X-24 gets the upper hand on Logan, but before he strikes the killing blow, Laura shoots him with the Adamantium bullet. 

Instead of leaving them guardianless and at the mercy of monolithic Government entities, Logan survives by the skin of his teeth. With his dream of escape with Charles dead, his healing factor waning, and no mutants left to nurture them, Logan reluctantly becomes their new Professor-X like figure. ",5x7z96
dehyhlx,"The only complaint I have is the stupid children did jack shit.  They were raised as soldiers.  Meanwhile X-Men were raised as prep school students.  When you attack X-Men children, they go into team fight mode.  These little dipshits just ran around and got captured.  It was a missed opportunity to have an army of child mutants fighting (even if they're outmatched) the Blackwater dudes.",5x7z96
dej2llw,"I don't think the X-Men franchise has ever set a high bar.  That said, First Class was really good and I even enjoyed Days of Future Past.  The younger X-Men and delving into Xavier and Magneto's past was a good call and refreshing and McAvoy and Fassbender are great.  

I've always thought the original trilogy was pretty awful, maybe except the first one, but even then, never been a huge fan of the X-Men movies.  

I went into this one with low expectations because X-Men Origins: Wolverine was utter trash and The Wolverine was only decent (I think it helped that I love everything Japan and the setting alone is why I liked it/was intrigued).  Standalone Wolverine movies gave me very little to look forward to.  

So, again the bar was set low on my expectations, which I really think helped a lot.  This was, standalone, the best Marvel (despite being Fox) movie since Guardians of the Galaxy in my opinion.  It was very easily the best superhero movie to come from Fox's studios and maybe because it wasn't about superpowers so much as more of a human side of the X-Men.  Wolverine's vulnerable, Xavier's vulnerable.  It's not like the whole vulnerability thing hasn't been done before (the bogus promise of it in the Wolverine felt like he was never really vulnerable and mortal).  

I didn't feel like him ""slowly losing his powers"" was cheaply explained (it made enough sense that I didn't feel the need to question it or let it take me out of the experience).  The road trip aspect and the very The Last of Us vibe I got out of it all was cool.  Man goes across the country tasked to protect an important child that he initially could care less about but their relationship builds along the way.  

The action sequences were great and the bad guy seemed realistic: they want their prize and they're willing to kill anyone who gets in the way, but they still see themselves as civil and good guys even going so far as to try to reason with Logan.  

The only things that were glaring, without going into spoiler territory  was Professor X's seeming ignorance and inability to recognize that he was putting others in danger as if he wasn't aware of the situation they were in.  Xavier, even if slightly senile, is smart enough to know these things and selfless enough to avoid putting others in harms way.  Seemed against his character and utterly stupid.  You know Logan hates the idea of putting others in harms way and you know he has the intuitive sense to not do so.  So puzzling decisions were made.  

Secondly, knowing Wolverine's abilities and how the big bad was stopped seemed a little strange.  We know what stops the big bad would not really stop the big bad in the comics.  So that whole plot device made no sense to me.  

Overall, great movie.  The pace and the tone were awesome.  The action was not too over the top.  The villains were formidable and yet realistic.  The emotional weight of the film hits home.  You feel for the characters and their plight very easily.  

All in all.  Best. X-Men film ever.  Best Wolverine standalone yet and probably best there will ever be now that Jackman's out.  

Edit: Oh wait, spoilers are cool on this thread.  Shit. ",5x7z96
delqbaw,"Watched this movie today and it was worth the money, as mentioned below, get Dolby Atmos for the seizure scene in the hotel if you rewatch it.

X23's acting was surprisingly good, she carried her weight with two acting legends...

I loved the grit and the trailer, but some of the story was just a huge letdown. Mutants ceasing to exist because of GMO food? What a great story /s

Villains sucked major dick, literally the worst part of the movie. You had the dude that looked badass with the robot arm, but does nothing but chase them and send henchmen after them, seriously, he has no back story or cool abilities, just a strong arm and guns. The evil doctor shows up for a few scenes, and is only alive to say he ended mutants then dies. And the wolverine clone, feels so original after seeing sabertooth, weapon x, etc /s.

 And of all people they clone, it's wolverine, because the guy with claws, and Regen is clearly the best mutant..

The trailer is like 9.5/10 
The movie is like 8/10

dehsswk,"Did it strike anyone else how much this movie borrowed from Children of Men?

* There's a brief shot of a newspaper article where it says that the lack of birth of new mutants has baffled the scientific community. In fact, this is a major plot point: no more new mutants are born, very similar to the infertility crisis in Children of Men. In both movies an answer is never given.

* Our anti-hero was once a hopeful political activist who has descended into a disillusioned, nihilistic alcoholic who is brought back into action on an escort mission for a girl that is hope for the future.  Originally only in it for the money, he recovers the hope he lost. Along the way, virtually everyone dies. 

* Wolverine is portrayed as a Christ-like figure, much like Theo. Theo dies when he reveals he is shot in the side - an obvious reference to Jesus' side being pierced by a spear. Wolverine is metaphorically crucified in the same way - pierced on his side. They both die after having completed their mission.

* Wolverine's mission is similar to Theo's, he must take a girl to a place that he is skeptical even exists but is the one hope for the future.

* Both movies are ""road films""; the journey and what the characters learn along the way is not as important as the destination.

There are probably more, but I kept feeling deja vu while watching this, that's not to say it's a bad movie. It was a great closure to the X-men franchise. ",5x7z96

I don't remember much of seeing it back then, but I do remember I had a wolverine figure that was likely from that movie. It had claws that would come out if you moved his legs or something. I around five when X2 came out. I think I saw that in theaters with my dad, at least he thinks so. Wolverine was my favorite. 

As a kid, I liked Xmen 3. Wolverine was pretty cool in it, and I was happy to see a live action Kitty Pryde (I also was watching Xmen:Evolution on tv around then). When I X-men:origins came out, I loved it. It was an pretty cool to watch as a kid. I think I knew it wasn't all that good, but I was happy to see a wolverine movie. 

I did not watch the next three movies until a year or two ago. I had largely forgotten how much I had lived the Xmen movies when my dad and I watched through all of them, up through Dofp. Seeing the first two for the first time since probably the first time I saw them brought back a whole lot of memories. Still, Wolverine persisted as my favorite. I was kind of sad I didn't get to see The Wolverine or Days of Future Past in theaters. 

I just saw Logan today. I got home maybe half an hour, forty five minutes ago. I'm still in tears. Charles's death was sad enough, but Logan's death really impacted me.

Tonally, it had a hard time deciding if it was an action flick or an emotional treatment, so it split the difference in a way that felt as though it was a combination of two screenplays. 

I *really* loved the man vs self aspect of the film (essentially, fighting his own [newfound ability to die, even going so far as to have Hugh play the younger mutant weapon](#spoiler)), and how the film wove bad guys in and out to avoid detracting from that.

The relationship between Laura and Wolverine was underdeveloped. It's totally antagonistic until [Wolverine is burying Professor X](#spoiler), and then we're supposed to understand they are suddenly close and care deeply about each other. It went from a first act to a third act relationship in one shot (when [Laura reaches out to hold his hand](#spoiler)). Without proper development of that relationship, the entire journey and [Han Solo move of ""I brought you here that was my job so I'm leaving ... okay I'll come back in the final set piece""](#spoiler) feels forced and artificial to me.

The [other mutant kids and reavers](#spoiler) could have been given a more thought-out treatment in the film (and I imagine they had written and maybe even shot some scenes for it), but I don't think the lack of story for them *detracts* . . . it's just another bit of wasted potential.

At the end of the day, I had fun watching *Logan*, and that's all I can really ask for. If my expectation hadn't been so high, maybe I wouldn't be disappointed. But I don't think I'll be eagerly awaiting the home release like I do with other movies.",5x7z96

Sure, let's have them just 'cross the border', and they will be completely safe. From an extremely shady and rich corporation. Right.

Let's also have a chase through the forest. What was that? Those soldiers are trained professionals? Who should have all kinds of equipment to subdue the subjects? No, no, they would definitely have to catch them by hand. Those kids are mutants! We need to show that they have all kinds of cool powers, you know?

X-24? Sure, let's just kill him with that bullet. That has been fired before. With a gun that just happens to fit the bullet. Oh, and it's definitely should be Laura who kills him. Even though she's never used a gun before. Let's also completely blow his brains out, so the audience knows he's dead. Not, like, amnesiac. Definitely dead.

Main villain? Let's just have the kids kill him in the cheesiest way possible. Show off their powers again! Have them act it out! Like, twist their hands, grimace, all that. *-The audience actually laughed during this scene, I kid you not.*

Stewart and Jackman were both great, as was the kid. The action was really fun to watch too, blood and body parts and savage destruction everywhere.

However, the villain was not that good. The doctor and X-24 were basically the Winter Soldier and the military dudes were so generic I only remember that they call themselves the Reavers. Nothing stood out about the guy with the robot arm despite being the most prominent villain there.

Second was that the stakes weren't there. The action was good but after a while you realise the two main characters can't die, and after Xavier died you know nobody is in any real danger, Laura's the new Wolverine and Wolverine can't die until the end of the movie. I had hoped they would at least shoot a couple of the kids, but nope they actually made it out even though it makes no sense that these ruthless mercenaries don't just shoot on sight. In the beginning they understand that Laura can heal so shooting at her is pointless, but none of the other kids can right?

The grittier, more grounded story is an interesting take on the X-Men universe and particularly for Wolverine because his outings have been mostly ridiculous and cartoony. The problems with the movie are that the pacing is horrid, the script is lacking, the editing of the action scenes is mostly bad, the villain is forgettable at best and unfortunately, this has an awful lot in common with other Wolverine movies. Weakness in his healing factor? Check. The plot stops to deal with some local problem (trees, landlords picking on family)? Check. Wolverine is alcoholic and wants to die? Check. Plus, it really needs to be said that the movie does grind to a halt and does actually get pretty boring sometimes. I'm glad to see an R-Rated depiction of Wolverine, but I'm seeing too much circlejerking around Logan. Even comparing this to The Dark Knight is completely ridiculous - it's a good movie and the best Wolverine movie ever made, yet, it still lacks in a lot of areas. That's why I'd give it a seven at highest. Also, the motif that Wolverine is haunted by his violent past represented by X-24 is heavy-handed and uninspired because we're just retreading old ground and shoe-horning in another villain for the sake of it. To be fair, the fight between the two is fucking awesome though.",5x7z96
deg1c60,"I gave it 7/10 though in hindsight should be 8. Throughout the 1st and 2nd acts it felt like 10/10 but the 3rd Act was mispaced and missed many opportunities to make more of an impact. 

Hugh Jackman puts on a killer performance that makes you really feel like what it is to be the Wolverine - ""Everyone I know goes away in the end"". The trailer choice of song is so apt. Indestructibility does not mean you can't be hurt, and Wolvie is in a world of pain. 

Kudos to the producers for daring to buck the formula, putting a focus on characters with an intensity that hasn't been reached since the Dark Knight trilogy. The packaging of the story as a kind of  road trip/adventure movie is also compelling enough to move the story along without being heavy handed (and indeed it starts falling apart when the road trip ends).

I have to dissent from the prevailing opinion here that the show needed its R rating. While it's true that this shows the impact of having adamantium claws, and how lethal X23 is, it's not a necessary element of the narrative. I do wish kids could have seen this, so that they can understand that life is sometimes painful, but you live with it so that others may know hope and hapiness.",5x7z96

deprmih,"Overall, I thought it was a very good movie, but there were definitely some things that stood out/bothered me:

* The score was entirely unmemorable.  I felt like there was a real disconnect between the tone of the movie and the tone the music tried to set.  Not one I'll probably ever listen to outside of the movie, either.

* As others have said, it felt like there was excessive swearing just to say ""hey look, we're rated R.""  I don't have a problem with swearing-I'm not a goody two-shoes or anything.  I just felt like they threw in a bunch of it just because.  

* Related to the above point, I felt like Prof. X acted too much like Logan instead of Prof X.  Maybe all these years of being under Logan's care has rubbed off, but I felt like there was too little of caring, wise, thoughtful Prof X (despite his mental condition).  Too much swearing from Prof X.  Just too out of character based on how we've seen him on screen in the past.  

* I felt like they could have developed the relationship between Logan and X-23 a little more.  I think they did a good job of building Laura's affection for Logan, but didn't do a very good job of building his for her.  I felt like everything he did for her was out of duty/obligation (which was fine at first) but not affection/love (which would have made ""the moment"" near the end have a much bigger emotional impact).

On the other hand, I thought Keen absolutely killed it.  She was VERY good and I hope we get to see more of her in the future.  I liked that we got to see many instances of Wolverine truly unleashed.  The cinematography was very good and I liked the style they were going for.  It was well-written.

I don't think I was quite as taken in by it as I was expecting to be given the glowing reviews, but I still would say definitely among the best of the X-Men movies.",5x7z96

dehyn85,"Really, really good movie.  I echo most of the thoughts here.  One thing really bothered me.  X-24.  Absolutely awful that they made a clone of Wolverine.  I felt that if they made something close to him, but not a copy, it would have been better.  It just felt so cheesy to me.",5x7z96
deibcef,Amazing. Best movie experience since The Force Awakens,5x7z96
dej9jl8,"X-24 is the only thing that truly bothered me about the movie. In a movie that seemed a bit more grounded and measured than the rest of the X-men movies his appearance was jarring and took me out of it a little bit. Not only are clones a contrived enemy in general but it's a huge leap to go from impregnating women and raising the kids from babies to straight up perfectly cloning mutants who they raise to adulthood immediately. No cloning project is going to have full-term babies as the phase-one with perfect adult clones being phase-two, there's a ton of steps in between there that lead you from one to the other.

If they were only 10 years away from perfect clones why bother with the more risky and resource intensive Mexican lady impregnation? Just spend your time ironing out the kinks in the adult-cloning program given that you can just immediately deploy them without having to house, train and school them for ~16 years before they are useful to you.
",5x7z96
dejhrwm,"Overall, a fantastic movie. I can't be the only person though who found a flaw with X-24. I mean, I get he was necessary to have the house scene work, but I feel there still could have been better choices. 

Sabretooth or Daken, for example.

It's more of a nitpicky flaw, but it sort of took me as a ""why is this necessary"" type of thing. I guess they just wanted Wolverine to fight Wolverine. ",5x7z96

degdnh7,"While the acting was phenomenal, I found the story and plot average at best. The bulk of the film was a cycle of Reavers catching up to them, fighting then escaping. It could have made a phenomenal short film perhaps, but it really isn't much to go on for a feature length.



This is compounded by how unthreatening the villains were relative to Laura and Logan. I mean the main antagonist is incapacitated by a thrown object before the first quarter and very well could have, and logically speaking should have, been eliminated. He really isn't distinguished from the other reavers apart from the movie framing him as an important person and a slight leadership role. He isn't particularly cunning and is in fact slightly more cowardly than his colleagues. In other words the character brings nothing to the movie apart from an entertaining personality, again, thanks to the actor. 


Lastly, probably due to the limitations of such a barren plot, characters do inexplicably stupid things in the movie. The biggest offender being the sending of Caliban to I dunno, taxi a dangerous person without even restraining him, and endangering an entire innocent, kind, family AFTER expressing concern for harming bystanders, and then AFTER helping said family out of kindness in the first place. The only way these two actions could be explained satisfactorily is if Logan secretly hates Caliban and black people.",5x7z96
dehtju9,"Really disappointing for me and I'm not sure if its because I didn't think it was so brilliant like many reviews claim for it to be or because the reviews made me have too high of an expectation for the film which obviously it would not achieve and would ultimately be my fault for believing that.

But don't get me wrong, Logan was a great film. It mixed a great grounded story with brutal bloody violence in away that wasn't jarring and just complimented each other. I did feel that the R rating was too much at some points because it just seemed that they, Logan especially, would just say fuck for fucks sake without really needing too but when used correctly like [Logan's rage outburst on the car over Charles' death](#spoiler) it was fantastic.

I also felt that the ending was a little cheap with how it was trying to get the ""feels"" with [Logan's goodbye to his ""daughter"", and I use quotation marks because I never felt like that bond was built up over the movie to even culminate in that goodbye scene when X-23 was calling him daddy. I never felt Logan treated her as nothing more than a stranger until the last forest fight, but then again he would have gone to save anyone who was in his care and needed help. He had better father-daughter bonding in the first X-Men film with Rogue than his own ""daughter"" in this film.](#spoiler)

Overall though this was a solid film that I will be buying on Blu-Ray when it comes out. And my favourite scene had to be the [Vegas hotel when Charles had another psychic freak-out forcing Logan to claw his way to him, stabbing soldiers frozen in place in the heads as he goes;](#spoiler) brilliant!

dequ5mp,"Just watched the movie.

Cant help but feel a little dissapointed. Great acting by Jackman and Stewart, really enjoyed their scenes. The action scenes were great too.

However, I find the entire scene towards the end with the kids really ruined the movie for me. From their acting to them hardly using their powers, it just all felt really cheesy. To top it off, Dafne Keen was great when so and so happened at the end but her speech? I was cringing as she was muttering those words from the western. It was really odd.

Furthermore, the score was really, really stale. Nothing memorable. Was hoping for some good old Johnny before the credits. 

Just some of my thoughts. Too much hype.",5x7z96
dehn38l,"Am i crazy, feel free to attack me, but did anybody not like X-24? Like i get the symbolism but i wish it was a improved/weaponized Sabertooth. Maybe that would be too much for the grounded type of story",5x7z96
dessfs7,"I'm not sure how I feel about it. I expected to be much more emotionally invested than I was, and I think a large part of that is because I expected even more screen time between Charles, Laura and Logan. I thought the movie would have focused on the core 3 a lot more than it did. 

To put it simply, i'd have rather had double the amount of dinner scene moments and less of the action. There's only so many times I can see Wolverine go all slashy slashy before I get bored, and whilst the blood and the unique kills (that arm shatter after the icing was great) stood out, I zoned out for much of the action.

The movie gets bonus points for having the balls to show so much of child injuries. Maybe they got away with it because X23 was unkillable in those situations, but still, it was a nice surprise to see. Added so much to the atmosphere and tension, and they really pushed the R rating to its potential. 

Overall I feel i'll need to see it again now knowing what it is. But I do wish we got more character building moments and less of the action, just because the villains and action set pieces are so much less investing when this is Hugh Jackman's last on screen outing as the character. Give me more Logan, less of the slashy slashy faff.

That all said, it's still one of the better X-Men movies. I really hope that Fox can make the early year R rated movie slot their own. Deadpool last year, Logan this year, maybe Deadpool 2 next year and X-Force after that. They seem to have struck gold with this slot as long as the movie quality remains good.

Oh, and despite my issues, James Mangold is one of my top pics to direct The Last of Us. I think he'd do the game justice and Jackman would be my top pic for Joel. ",5x7z96

dej4g55,"I hate to be that guy but I just felt very unaffected by much of the film. I really enjoyed the initial aesthetic but found the plot and set pieces to be underwhelming. It should've been rather obvious to them to not stay with that family and they do so anyways. This was a  strange film where I wish they dwelled on certain things more (what happened to the xmen) and on other things less (family, wolverine falling asleep). It felt long but unfufilling as I wanted to experience more but less of what was being offered. Also rather obvious directing in terms of the bullet and ""x24"". They constantly reference it with Laura even panning to it before the kid crushes him with a car. We know that x24 isn't dead so the attempted suspense seems to not work here. Also - I don't understand why he didn't kill arm guy as soon as he was knocked out. I understand killing ""is hard"" for him but he does it constantly so it seems a bit inconsistent here. Honestly, this is nitpicky but so much of the plot detracted from execution of the film for me.

I thought the idea of a Wolverine clone was absolutely horrible and bought it back to being a really generic Super-Hero film.

Pros:

- First act in mexico + the first part on the run

- Bloody hell Hugh Jackman was great

- Patrick Stewart

Cons:

- Everything from the farm onwards (Except for the part where X-23 got Logan to a doctor)

At the casino, I was honestly expecting people heads to be exploded or something after Charles' seizure, but then everyone got up. Then when he says, ""I'm so sorry,"" I laughed. I wasn't supposed to, but there was nothing to show that he really is dangerous to others and himself. Sure the drivers are probably injured, but you don't see the drivers. There needed to be people who didnt get up, blood coming out their ears.

Then after almost getting shot in the face, they decide to go to someone's house and get them killed, but not before Logan leaves the two alone. I dont know if he expected Laura to defend Charles if anything happened but it was stupid of him to leave.

Finally, why the hell are bad guys so easily marveled by super powers? When the mercs were chasing the kids, they manage to knock one off her feet. She immediately takes 4 seconds to charge up her powers, enough time for a merc to take her down. Instead, they finally get the hint that they are fighting people with super powers, and start to question their reality, leading to their death.

It was a great movie, I loved it. I loved that the fight at Logan's home was the best extended fight sequence in the entire franchise and it basically featured only one super power.

dene0ev,"Before I begin, let me just say that I'm not the biggest X-men fan, but my expectations were very high for this movie. The trailer made it look so good! 

That being said I found the movie to be disappointing the whole way through. The idea that all the mutants were gone, except for Logan, Xavier, and Caliban and that they find this Wolverine-inspired experiment (Which has been done a couple times in the movies now, no?) and need to get her to this safe haven; That was a cool premise, but I found it to be poorly executed. 

The enemy finds them at every stop. Xavier being annoying and senile and suggesting the worst things when their lives are in danger. A random clone of Wolverine shows up, has little dialogue or importance, is killed off. Laura calling Wolverine daddy....she's like 10 and they barely knew eachother...not well enough for her to call him daddy imo. I could go on. 

The movie has it's good sides as well. It wasn't a terrible movie, but I think most of it's praise is coming from the fact that it's Hugh's last time as Logan/Wolverine. 

Also, I know the opening scene with Deadpool was just a promo and has no connection to the film itself, but doesn't Deadpool exist in the Fox X-men canon? Will future movies take place after Logan? Isn't their timeline now split with Deadpool taking place before the events of Logan.....gah. lkjgjkb",5x7z96

If I recall, I think her and Logan's first, and longest, conversation concludes with Logan yelling shut the fuck up over and over again. I know we skip over a few days of travel and maybe I'm missing cues or not considering her reaction was also one based on the culmination of all the parental figures she'd lost up till that point too.

[-Why did X-24 wait for Charles' speech to end before killing him?
-Why did the adamantium bullet kill X-24? It's been shown not to kill Logan (albeit make him lose his memory) and wouldn't his brain and normal skull just regenerate anyway?)
-Why didn't they shoot robot hand when they had the chance? Why risk him still being alive?
-Why did the kids run away from the soldiers? I know they're just kids and they can be killed by bullets, but I'm pretty sure X-23 and kid magneto could have taken them
-WHY DID CHARLES PUT THE FAMILY IN DANGER LIKE THAT?!?
-When Charles has his seizures, it freezes humans. However when Logan kills those guys in the hotel while they're frozen, they dont drop down until Charles' seizure stops. So is charles controlling the bodies of dead people at that point?](#spoiler)

dekb2oj,"The first superhero movie in a little while that managed to be good on the screenplay/developed theme axis and still got me a little tingly about the subliminal aspects.  I somehow missed that it was R not PG13 going in, but it was insanely violent and used the F word quite a bit.  The Shane stuff was amazing (the use of the word “brand” gave me chills).  I liked this a lot.

Basic analysis is that it was Age of Ultron inverted.  It is a generational anxiety movie by someone with a different set of issues about the transition between Gen X and what’s next.  In AoU, Tony, in order to keep the next generation safe from making his mistakes, brings on a catastrophe, the way out of which is to learn to let go and create a system with more input and step aside.  Logan abandons the next generation to be raised by the corporate hellscape, which causes a dystopia, and must step up to demonstrate masculinity and reclaim his suppressed righteous rage, then “fucking die, already.”  They both have a farmhouse in the middle to learn an important lesson.  In AoA they learn what they need from real America and set out to correct their mistakes.  In Logan, everyone in real real America dies except the predators - the black family struggling as farmers, the racist corporatist bullies, even the Haliburtonesque corporate/federal paycheckers. Tony lives on to forget everything for the next outing, while Moses Logan, having led his charges out of  Egypt Inc. and through the desert, dies in sight of the promised land, never reaching it. 

The best scene is the one in the Bronco where Laura talks for the first time (where she keeps repeating the names of her fellow escapees and holds the map upside down - the psychogeography of this movie is enough for a big effort post where Lacan will be mentioned - America as the desert of the real, Mexico as the unreal, Canada as the imaginary).  The southern-boy representative of the new lethal masculine will in thrall to the globalist ambiguously-national oligarch dies really funny with the multicultural kids using their weirdness to kill him.  The discussion of the foot claws was super intriguing for its talking around the idea of rape, which is central to the comic X23′s origin.   I couldn’t hear very well but I think Logan’s second to last sentence was something like “Ves como madre tu” (Look like your mother?)) and the actress look distractingly like Famke Jansen.  The drones were a nice touch.

Borders and immigration will no doubt be a robust read (those limousine passengers… Jeez). I’m more interested in Mexico as the subconscious where Logan must go to retrieve the memory of the past, who now has Alzheimers, and the borders as something of a metaphor.  Then there’s Canada as a destination he knows is a lie and must learn to believe in anyway.  Additionally, I feel like they changed New Orleans to Oklahoma City in post, but both make no sense since they could easily claim Vegas was on the way and run with that.  It would provide the same function.

Nice.",5x7z96

Days of Future Past: Same thing, hes a drug addict in the past, and in present times he doesn't do anything

Apocalypse: Not really professor X

Logan: I get it, I get that they are both dying and X is especially old/sick. Still though, during that initial get away scene... professor x just fucking sits there. I know I know hes old and weak and can't control it as well, but he doesn't even try? Just have him make ONE of the goons go insane or something. 


I really wish they had just one more IN CONTROL badass professor x scene. Not the hotel one where it was l maybe he did it kind of on purpose but also lost control.

Hugh Jackman was goddamned fantastic as the titular character and I wouldn't be surprised if he gets an Oscar nomination. The Girl was very good too, although her final monologue (not her writing I guess) was a bit silly. The death of Wolverine was such a gut punch I had to hold in the tears.

denkrr4,"So, I loved like 95% of the movie but I just can't get over the ending of it.  I mean, I had a better ending in my head keeping the entire rest of the story intact, walking out of the theater.  First of all, Zander Rice gets off way too easy.  [The gun was a great foil of course Logan doesn't like guns so no one's going to expect it, but c'mon, taking him out in one shot?  How much more satisfying would it have been to have Logan wound him, then take out Pierce's cybernetic hand like he did, and while strolling after him casually pop his claws and take a slice out of a wounded Zander Rice as he passed him, without even looking at him, to finish him off?](#spoiler)

And it's not that [Logan dies, he pretty much has to.  It's the fact that his death is utterly meaningless and his sacrifice is ultimately a failure.  Yes, he reunites Laura with her pals from the lab, keeps them out the hands of the Reavers and Zander Rice, and they presumably make it to Canada where it's ""safe"" (is it?) but none of that was really important.](#spoiler)  There's a lot of talk in this thread about ""what's killing Logan"" and while there's a technical explanation given in the movie the truth is, it's guilt.  Guilt over the people he's killed, the people he's hurt, the people he has tried to help and hasn't been able to, and guilt over those who he has outlived who may have actually lived a better life than him (in his eyes).  It's because of this guilt that even though his first reaction is still to fight, his heart isn't really in it anymore [think of how easily the gang members take him down at first in beginning or how easily he's subdued early on by the Reavers; it's only once his rage kicks in and he goes into berserk mode does his fighting spirit return](#spoiler).

This guilt comes to the forefront in a conversation between Logan and Laura where Logan talks about learning how to deal with hurting people.  Laura mentions that she's only hurt bad people and Logan says something like, ""You'll have to learn to live with that, too.""  [This conversation coming just on the heels of having buried Charles, after he was killed by X-24.  Which gets to the heart of Logan's guilt and isolation -  he does a good deed for the Munson family and accepts their hospitality.  In return his mere presence puts their family in danger and ends up getting them slaughtered when X-24 comes to kill Charles and collect X-23.  The scene ends with X-24 beat up and pinned between a truck and combine and it would be easy, from Laura's young and immature point of view, to say that the only person they (Logan and Laura) hurt was X-24, a bad guy, but the Munsons and Charles also died as a result of them being tracked there and that guilt weighs on Logan.  He knows that one day it will weigh on Laura too and more than anything else that's what he wants to save her from.](#spoiler)

[The final confrontation be X-24 and Logan is literally a struggle between a man and his inner demon, with X-24 representing Logan's younger, wilder self that he holds responsible for so much of the guilt that he feels.  It could have been set up as a wily, experienced master using every last bit of his expertise against his most physically challenging foe](#spoiler) - considering that Logan is (according to the Fox movies, as broken down by [CineFix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YGHDTIUt0s) 197 years old physically and 253 years old mentally/emotionally [he is considerably more experienced than X-24 and a strategic fight would be the smart one and the more interesting one.  Instead, the writers chose for a brawl which could only end in one way.  Don't get me wrong, there should be no circumstance in which Logan walked away from that confrontation - but there could have been one where he was the victor.  Instead his guilt and his fear and his rage from his younger self defeated him and it was up to X-23 to ""save"" him, but that's not what happens.  Sure, she kills X-24 but that does nothing to resolve his internal conflict.  His death is not a peaceful one, and maybe the filmmakers are saying that Logan doesn't deserve one - that after a life of such utter violence and turmoil his death should be just as such.](#spoiler)  I personally think that he deserved a better ending than he got.

[There are some who might say ""But by Laura killing X-24 she's killing that beast in her before it can do to her what it did to Logan"" and that may be true, but this isn't her story.  It's not called Laura or X-23.  I wasn't going in to this hoping that Logan would walk away.  But I was hoping that he would get some redemption.  Instead, by forcing Laura to kill X-24 - because that's what he did by being unable to do it himself - he's added another name to her kill list and piled more guilt on for her to deal with.  Honestly, of all the people that Laura has probably killed to this point, X-24 was probably the most innocent.  He was almost exactly what she was.  He didn't ask to be what he was, he didn't have a choice.  He wasn't evil - to anyone other than Logan, he was little more than an animal.](#spoiler)

The movie was good, and the violence justified by the story instead of just being tacked on as some sort of fan service or in order to justify the rating.  I actually thought that the violence was both appropriate and somehow not over the top.  I was just really deadened by the ending, it was like a sucker-punch.  Like they had treated this character so well for so long (even in the bad movies Jackman portrayed him so well) and then they just gave him that ending.  He deserved better.

I just thought he would at least get a little piece of the pie when this was all over for all the crap he's had to go through. But...nope. I just had the feeling that if he had gotten through this escapade he would eventually gotten involved in something else and the same fate would have occurred. There are other questions that probably won't be answered, but I guess that isn't as important since this was Logan's story after all.

My only criticism is that the runtime feels too long, like they're stretched a 2 hour movie into 2.5 hours. Highly recommended!",5x7z96
deg6b65,Does anyone know the song that's played on the kids phone? I swear I've heard it before ,5x7z96
deg7dm5,It's by no means perfect but it was the most I've enjoyed a superhero film in a long time. I've been so bored with the genre but Logan was still thoroughly enjoyable (probably because it strays from a lot of the normal superhero tropes). The violence was so damn satisfying and there were a few really great performances to boot. 7.5/10,5x7z96

The henchmen people, most of them had metal arms. The main one described himself as being 'enhanced'. But they don't seem to be super strong like the Winter Soldier's or anything. They don't even explain why so many of them have it.  

The evil doctor character...was that Stryker's son? In their final confrontation Logan said he killed his father, or something. But this doesn't seem to be the case, since his character's name is Rice.   

Why was Logan's healing going to shit? What was he sick with? ",5x7z96

Edit: yes, I do know that Daken is Logan's biological son who was stolen by the Winter Soldier and given to the anchient mutant Romulus (on the list of Storylines We'll Never See in a Fox movie) and returned to menace his father in the modern day. 

Side note: the Daken series was a nice subversion, or straight take, of the ""damaged love interest"" archetype. Real good magnificent bastard stuff.",5x7z96
degsw8t,"Loved the subtle nod the Old Man Logan, ""I remember what I made you do"". Charles being controlled to brainwash Logan into killing the avengers was heartbreaking in the comics.
Amazing movie and a perfect ending to Wolverine.

EDIT: just remembered in the comics it isn't Charles who brainwashes him. But I guess this is the movie canon version in order to keep it separate from the MCU universe.",5x7z96
degvclq,"So I thought it was interesting that they did the math right with the whole ""no more mutants being born thing"". The movie takes place in 2029 and at some point Wolverine (I think) says there haven't been any mutants *born* in 25 years.

That would be 2004, and since mutant powers don't typically manifest themselves until puberty, they would have started noticing that no more mutants were coming to fruition right around 2017. Nice touch, if intentional.

That being said, some of the young mutants in this movie were certainly pre-pubescent, and clearly they had their powers so I'm not sure if that was a result of the experimentation or what. I'd imagine the comics explained this a long time ago since X-23 has been around for like 10 years and I'm pretty sure she was pre-pubescent since her debut. I have those comics but I'm not about to dig them up to look for an explanation.",5x7z96

degwljz,"I think I may have completely misheard a part of the film because I haven't seen anyone else talking about it.  
During the scene where we see how the mutant children were living in the hospital there is a part which focuses on especially X-23 and I was certain I heard ""the Mexican equivalent of Deadpool"" which I thought makes sense as she has the younger, more potent healing factor similar to Deadpool's.  
But now I'm starting to doubt myself. Anyone else hear this, or correct me on what was actually said? ",5x7z96
degz7fc,"SPOILERS

Did anyone catch that asylum was across the border, 8-miles from a point in North Dakota? Did they pull from the original Old Man Logan comic and have the United States be broken up?

Also, it's kind of amazing how the movie flips the comic - a beaten down family man with a terrible past, in a world run to the ground by the bad guys, finally puts his guns down to rest, instead of picking them back up again. 

I love the source material, but it's a real testament of film-making and storytelling on how well they handled everything, choosing choice elements, and synthesizing them with other powerful Wolverine stories.

Sure Adamantium being indestructible and all is cool but now that we know the reason behind Wolverine's deteriorating health, Bone claws would have been so much better in the long run... We all know bones would naturally heal fractures and stuff,  become stronger in the process after getting damaged. With Wolverine's natural healing factor unbound by Adamantium, his bones would constantly become stronger, tougher, thicker and his healing factor, uncompromised. This way, we have a much faster, more feral, more violent Wolverine without all that Adamantium slowing him down.... Making an awesome action movie featuring Wolverine the beast unleashed.",5x7z96

One question if someone could help me out. I was not very clear on the male genes that were used for the young mutants. They said Mexican women birthed the children and x23 was Logan's child, but where were they harboring male mutant genetics, in particular Wolverine's? 

I had the side thought that she was na actual child of Wolverin'es and Gene's because she kind of looked like her, but that does not make sense with the info given.

Besides that, it was a beautiful, emotional film that closed out a classic Marvel character and if the Academy snubs either Patrick Stewart or Hugh Jackman's performance, they'd better have a damn good reason for it.

",5x7z96
deyxw6w,"I knew this had 94% on Rotten Tomatoes, so perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was sorely disappointed.

Almost nothing about what little plot there was made sense.

1) Logan is ageing because the adamantium is poisoning him. So even though he can instantly heal from being almost vaporised (X3)  the adamantium inside him, even though it had no effect from the 70's - 2015, has in the space of fourteen years effected him so badly that he's ageing and his powers are diminished. Why would this not have happened earlier and how could it happen at all given his healing ability?

2) Somehow none of the origin movies or X1-X3 happened, but they referenced the statue of liberty so... Some of it happened? Marvel can't even keep continuity for a single character let alone a franchise.

3) The only established characters (Charles and Wolverine) act pretty differently to their established characters. Charles refers to Caliban as ""that fucking albino"" when his most defining trait is seeing the good in everyone and speaking well about them. Wolverine abandons a small girl he knows to be his daughter to be killed by soldiers at least three times when arguably his most defining traits are bravery and loyalty.

3) The evil goons chasing down the mutants are like video game AIs, completely incompetent with no logic or care for their own wellbeing. These are the guys are supposed to have taken down every other mutant and they can't take down and old, dying Wolverine and a group of ragtag kids.

4) Logan is supposed to take place in the Days of Future Past timeline. In Logan, Wolverine says no mutant has been born in 25 years, yet just a few years before 2029 we see kids walking around the X-mansion.

There are plenty more plotholes like Charles Xavier being dead and at least not having any hair or being paralyzed if he's alive, but even despite all that the whole thing seemed like a high budget heavy handed student film.

When the farmer said that, he meant soda and candy are poison and we should stop drinking and eating it.

Instead the last scene we get is Logan dead in the ground and the kids running off. Normally I wouldn't mind as it was truly a great ending, but I think wolverine deserves for us to know that he did not die for nothing.

* This movie is show, don't tell taken to an extreme. Pretty much the *entire* backstory to the plot is in half-finished sentences and little asides. I got a little annoyed with it during the movie, but after thinking it over I've come to appreciate it and would prefer other movies took this approach (fingers cross Ghost in the Shell).

* Gabriela says all of those children were born from (probably) kidnapped Mexican women inside of a Mexico City laboratory that they never left until their escape. How come only Laura seems to have the accent? It's possible that it was due to differences in caretakers or scientists, but it seems like all the nurses the kids were close to were Mexican.

* I know a lot of people seem to be big fans of this, but the X-Men comics being real thing was a terrible plot point. The only reason it's really in the story is for the revelation that Eden is made-up. What really gets under my skin is that they look exactly like real life comics, AKA made for a younger audience. If we're supposed to take the franchise seriously, didn't Apocalypse kill an *enormous* amount of people? Millions upon millions dead. but around 40 years later they turned it into comics for children? What if, today, we had comics geared toward children that were based on the Jonestown Massacre?

* Not a fan of the Beyond Thunderdome shit with all the mutant kids. It devalued the emotional impact of seeing our main characters struggle when you add in a bunch of poorly-introduced side characters that are supposed to be gravely important to X23.

* Piggybacking off the last point, super unsatisfying death for the villain. Should have given that honor to our actual protagonists. Plus, felt weird to have the villain's death be completely obscured by malevolent grass.

* At the beginning, Xavier's one-minute seizure seriously distressed Caliban, and looked quite painful for Logan. We're also told Logan (and X23) are more resistant to the debilitating effects of the seizures because of the healing factor. It seems like having a seizure so long that Wolverine and X23 are nearly incapacitated by it would do much more than daze the non-mutants around the area. Hell, when they were leaving I saw a grandma holding her head by a wall. With what we're told and shown, it seems like her brains should have been dribbling out of her ears.

* Poor farm family. Did *not* expect them to just kill off that teen. The father trying to shoot Logan before dying from his wounds was a fantastic way to end that plotline.

* Considering adamantium has slowly been poisoning Wolverine's body since it was put in (late 70's), and only just now proving fatal, would the adamantium bullet really kill off an in-his-prime Wolverine clone *instantly*? It didn't even get lodged in, it blew off the side of his head and came out. If this has been used in the comics before, please chime in.

* The movie succumbed to the faceless baddie thing by having some mercs using gas mask helmets, which to me really took away from the brutal fight scenes. They avoided it in the first fight scene and the slaughter at the farm, and having non-mooks worked well there. I wish it stayed in all the scenes :\

* Turning the makeshift cross into an X is possibly the cheesiest thing I've seen in a long fuckin' time. Just having the grave with the kids walking across the border in the background would have been a great ending, but we had to get a quick reminder that it's an X-Men movie before the credits rolled. I've seen a lot of love for the X headstone in this thread, but I won't pretend that it wasn't groan-inducing.

Despite how all these points might look, I really did love the movie! In the end, all the nitpicks did nothing to sully my final view of the film. It's hard for me to decide what's the best X-Men movie, this or Days of Future Past. Until I rewatch the latter and get to my answer, I'll settle on giving this movie a 9/10. I'd recommend this to pretty much anyone, even those who haven't been fans of any of the previous X-Men movies.",5x7z96

dep857w,"I'm in the minority here I'm sure, but this didn't do much at all for me. It was filmed incredibly, but I couldn't emotionally connect to Logan, or any of the main characters really. The dialogue just felt forced to me. Giving it a 6/10.

degmh9h,"I never comment my own opinion and this is going to get burried BUT this is the only movie where even 12 hours after watching it, listening to hurt by johnny Cash or just thinking about the end of logan makes me choke up and I hold myself from crying. 

A story I've followed since X-men 1, is finally laid to rest. Hugh gave it his all during this movie and I fucking thank you, I thank you for making me feel human during the end and making me realize.... that in the end, so was logan. 

I fucking love this movie, it's going to be a classic, and I'll cry as a grown ass fucking man every time I re-watch it. 

Fuck you Hugh for making such a perfect character. You nailed it, be proud of that !

Edit: I also realized, the ""way down we go"" song was foreshadowing the movie. ""we're going to get what we deserve"" (both feel terrible about the things they've done, they feel like they don't deserve this life) and ""Oh way down we go"" just was foreshadowing the deaths. ",5x7z96

Unfortunately these building blocks of what made the movie unique from other marvel movies don't get resolved organically.

deg2qvs,"What can i say about this movie. I wanted to write about everything i loved, what i liked and what i didn't. However, it's tough for me to put my thoughts into words so i chose to just list them off;

What i liked

* Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Boyd Holbrook had to be the stand outs for me. The scenes between Hugh and Boyd felt really intense and the back and forth between the two in the Limo outside the hospital was fantastic.

* The violence. It didn't feel over the top or out of place, they did the fight scenes well and did the gore 

[X24 and Logans fight. Amazing to watch on the big screen. It felt so vicious and violent, just like how Wolverine should've been all these years.](#spoiler)

* SPOILER [The whole situation with the comic book. I figured from the trailer it was just going to be a throwaway scene, but they made the comic book a central part of the story and i felt like it was fun and unique.](#spoiler)

* Logan IS Logan finally. Foul mouth, angry and violent. It looked like Hugh had a blast playing the character this way and i had a blast watching it. It's a shame it's all over now when they really just got started.

What i didn't like

* I didn't dislike much about this movie and this is a small thing, but it is something that has bothered me since leaving the theatre. 
SPOILERS [Logan never got his chance to be happy. It was only misery on top of more misery. His heroic moment was fine and one could argue his moment of happiness was rescuing X23 and her friends while dying in the process. Everything Logan went through in this movie and his reward was his own death and the death of his friends. Not even Charles or Caliban got their chance of happiness. Once again, you could argue Charles was old and wanted to die and that Caliban got to choose the way he went out, but they never really had their moment in the sun. Even the poor Munson family got butchered after being so kind. As a consequence of that, i think the movie really lacked any kind of hopefulness at the end. I didn't feel much of an attachment to X23 or any of the kids and the ending just kinda missed for me.](#spoiler)

I also have a quick question for those who have seen the movie. Just as a warning it's a spoiler. SPOILER [Is Eden real? The way i see it, is that it wasn't real because Charles and Logan argue over bringing X23 to North Dakota because Logan thinks it's stupid taking a kid to a place that isn't real, while Charles thinks it's important to let her believe it's real so she has hope. However was Eden ever real? Sure the kids have that small shack in the middle of nowhere but they still had to cross the border. What will happen to the kids once they cross the border if Eden isn't real? are they on their own? If Eden is actually real why wouldn't Logan want to go with the kids to see what's going on? I'm pretty confused on this point.](#spoiler)

Overall solid movie that i think is probably going to be slightly over hyped due to the emotional aspect of it all. I think it's a solid 8/10 and definitely up there as my favourite CBM of all time.",5x7z96
deg6cy7,"Typically I don't care for superhero movies for the same reason I shouldn't have cared for this. It was formulaic.

1) It really didn't feel like it was set in 20XX (whatever year they said). Given Logans age it's clearly a few years in the future, but technology/aesthetics (apart from the trucks) seems to be almost 90's.

2)I felt it lacked a main antagonist. There's one-hand-guy, who kinda served as the big-bad, but you also never find out his name or anything about him, and doesn't really seem very powerful. There's the scientist, who is implied to be the main villain but has almost no screen time. There's X-24, who's basically just the machina for them to put a 'boss fight' in, so you can have someone strong enough to kill Logan",5x7z96

 I feel like I must have missed something, because I could never tell what Logan was trying to accomplish until the incident after the farm. Until that point he seemed to be doing things because the movie needed stuff to happen.

dehy0xt,"Nice film apart from the inconsistencies.

Kids are ""raised to be machines/killers"" - they all just run away from men with guns while being helpless because the plot demands it. Even X-23 starts running for no reason. They have a psychic/magneto kid who for some reason can't do anything until the end because plot.

&nbsp;

They say the in the middle of the movie that the experiment was over and all the kids started getting terminated. But now all the bad guys wanna do is re-capture the kids / not actually kill them. 

&nbsp;

In the first real action scene with X23 all the soldiers are basically storm troopers. She kills like 2 or 3 of them from being majorly close and manages to some how run away with only like 4 bullets being fired and all missing her.

How is X24 dead when they already established the premise that he cant die to an adamantium bullet.

deihv5v,"I enjoyed the movie very much and prefer it to most superhero movies (never liked the overly clean and quippy Marvel movies much but loved the Nolan Batman movies). But I was feeling very excited for this one and felt just a little let down. Many will disagree with me, but I feel it would have been much better with a couple of changes. 

1. Take out the other mutant kids. First of all, the stakes would be much higher if Laura was the only chance for mutant-kind to continue, instead of there being a whole group of kids (plus the potential for scientists to breed more). I also liked how this movie mainly focused on only the brutal, more physical mutants (Wolverine and Laura). It felt more human and somewhat real. Introduce a girl who can breathe frozen air, or a kid who can levitate things, or whatever other powers there were, and it starts to drift back into campiness. Laura needed to be more important, rather than just one of a bunch.

2. A lot of people seemed to like it, but I wasn't fond of the X-24 Wolverine clone. It just seems like such a worn out trope in comics to have ""an evil clone"" to fight the protagonist. I also think it would have been more emotional and tragic for Logan to have been killed by regular people or in some other ""normal"" way to show how far he has fallen, rather than being beaten by his evil clone. Also, it took away from the emotional impact of the nice family at the farm dying when they were killed by evil Wolverine instead of just brutal people with guns. That was another one of those ""normal comic book movie"" elements that I wish they had left out to make this movie feel more original.

3. Take out Caliban. He served little purpose other than being a plot device, and took away from the bleakness of just Xavier and Logan being the last original mutants left.

Further than that, I had kind of made up in my mind what the movie would be like from the first trailer (which may be one of the best trailer's of all time, the one with Johnny Cash's version of ""Hurt"").

In the trailer, I was under the impression that Wolverine was the last mutant on Earth (due to his line about all of the mutants being gone). No Xavier, no Caliban, etc. This made sense to me and seemed very tragic and impactful, that all of the mutants are gone, and the only one still alive is the one who is cursed with healing power and essentially immortality. Logan is truly alone in the world in my mind. 

But then we see and hear Xavier talking in the trailer, which, for some reason or another, I wondered if maybe he wasn't physically there, but was more ""in Logan's head."" Imagine how interesting it would have been if no one could see Xavier except for Logan, leading the viewer to wonder if Xavier is just a figment of imagination or ""conscience"" for Logan, or if Xavier's body is gone but he still exists in some other way and can still speak to people telepathically. I wondered, ""Maybe the Xavier we see in the backseat of the car saying, 'Someone has come along, Logan."" is either Logan's guilty conscience, or just a guiding voice for him on this final journey.""

I did like that Xavier was a feeble old man who could not control his powers anymore, but I can't help but think about how much more artfully done it could have been in the other way...

Also, from the trailer I got the impression also that Laura was the last mutant after Logan, and that he needed to protect her to continue mutant-kind. No other mutant kids, just Laura. And I hoped she would have been a natural ""mutant"" not created in a lab. That makes Logan's final mission so much more important, because they aren't necessarily running to some ""safe Eden"" but instead he's just trying to protect the last mutant on Earth from being killed. I feel it would have been much more emotionally impactful had there been no other mutant kids, and Logan sacrifices himself just to protect this one girl.

devexjz,"I loved the first 80% and liked the last 20%. 

I think that there were some missed opportunities that took the last bit of the movie off for me a bit, and there wasn't much that they would have needed to do to take it from good to great. 

Here's my thoughts:

[I thought the comics were actually a very interesting plot element. It helps to lay the groundwork for an important theme: fantasy or reality. The people that realize what Logan is either interact with him as a character of legend (thinking he's *the guy* from the comics* or taking the mutant prejudice that has made the world what it is today) or out of who he actually is (Professor X, Caliban, and Pierce are some of the only ones that actually know his history). When Logan realizes that Gabriela has made this plan based on the *fictional* comics, he concludes that this entire mission is a sham. I expected them to continue to pull on this thread throughout the movie, continually asking these characters to question whether or not this ""safe haven"" actually exists (not much needs to change from what's already in the movie). **However**, once Xavier dies, Logan realizes that it's up to him to teach Laura--to guide her, teach her, mentor her--just as Xavier has done with him for the last 30 years. At this point, he chooses to get Laura to this safe haven--accepting the fact that he doesn't know if it actually exists. There would actually be very little that would need to be re-shot, actually--they could just switch around a few sequences. At some point, Logan and Laura get chased through the forest--the whole fight sequence still takes place, and ends essentially the same way. Logan's fight to get Laura to the safe haven isn't just that he cares about her--it's founded on his choice to believe. When he eventually dies (which I think needed to happen), he dies never seeing this place. This could have made his death so much more meaningful (not that it wasn't already)--while he would never know if she makes it, he would know that he has given her something that he never got growing up--hope, belief, humanity, humility.](#spoiler)

I was actually a little disappointed, because i felt that the film was planting the seeds to lead up to a moment similar to this. But I still really liked the movie.

Something else I think they could have done without much extra effort: [As he lay on the ground dying, we could have had flashbacks to meaningful moments and people in his life: Jean Grey smiling. Xavier saying something wise. Rogue giving him a hug. Cheesy moments, but would 100% would increase the impact of these last moments. We would see that this is a man that has lived a long life--we've seen the dark past, these flashbacks would show the bright spots.](#spoiler).

EDIT:[the whole flashback thing could have been used throughout the whole movie, actually. There were several sequences where Logan was trying to fall asleep but couldn't... we could have a few instances where he starts to doze off and there's a quick flash of Jean Grey that starts him awake. Or even doing flashbacks of memories of him savagely killing someone. This would add a haunting depth to his character.](#spoiler)

That's just me. In general I think this is one of the better ""superhero"" movies in the last few years and will be a significant film in the genre for a long time. And maybe someday I'll try my hand at re-editing the movie. ",5x7z96

delt0sc,"Loved the movie. I would like to say however that it kind of made me hate Xavier. He was fully aware that they were being tracked by violent, armed, dangerous men. Logan even told him, these people are at risk around us. And Charles is just like ""But dinner was so nice and I'm having the best night."" Fuck you Charles, innocent people are dead now ",5x7z96
desz89w,"Maybe I'm spoiled by some of the great action seen in recent films, but I felt like Logan's action was just okay.

the best action scenes imo were the non-Wolverine scenes. The clone getting impaled, the nature girl attack, the paralysis scene were all solid as fuck.

It's a shame they didn't make the fights between the two Wolverines more substantial. As it was, the fighting of Logan was very Skyrim-y since it was basically hack and slash with very rudimentary camera work at times. Plus the novelty of X-23 wore off towards the end. It lacked the substance and grit of Winter Soldier's action, which is sort of understandable since Jackman and the girl can't exactly meticulously train to give every punch and kick the impact a film like John Wick could give, hence the use of too many jump cuts and shaky cam.

Ultimately the director confuses brutality and hyperviolence with quality. There's a point where gore becomes gratuitous and is used as an excuse to cover up clichéd action, instead of being used to add something to the sequence.

For example the use of the harpoon gun was gory but also created an element that both X-23 and Logan had to fight around. On the other hand, Logan and his clone were basically taking turns stabbing each other in the chest.",5x7z96
deggc5c,"I dare say this tops out over Dark Knight as best comic book movie. It's probably even further removed from the term ""comic"" than DK though. Aside from the mutant angle, this truly is a chase film, centered around family. The way they walked the line with Prof X and 23 being both comic relief and heartbreaking (X) and terrifyingly lethal (23) helped even out Wolvy's constant brooding (which was perfect done in this movie).  Everything about the film was done perfectly and you could fee the heartbreak in the silence as the film ended. 
Deadpool cameo crushed as well but damn would it have been better at the end to soften the blow instead of being the funny lead-in. There's a bunch of men that would have been able to cover up the tears with laughter waking out of the theater. ",5x7z96
defzxq8,"Just got back. Great film. I thought for the most part the pacing was good. It was story, action, story, action. 

Really pleased with the way they did their R rating. Was worried Fox execs would go overboard after the success Deadpool had. They didn't. All of the violence, swearing, and gore fit the tone of the movie and those characters. ",5x7z96
deg54dp,"I guess I'm in the minority here, I thought it was only pretty good. I liked the action and I liked the slower pace driven by character moments. But I felt like Charles was the one holding those moments together. The transition Logan makes from ""I don't care about you, little girl"" to ""I will die for you, daughter of mine"". It wasn't there for me. I also felt like the pacing got a little bit slow in the second act. Introducing the entire farmer family and setting up all of those puzzle pieces was unnecessary IMO.

The sheer strength of direction and acting and action though was more than worthwhile though, even if the script needed another draft or two. Solid movie, but not my favorite X movie. ",5x7z96

dej2c34,"I can appreciate the well acted movie and how perfect of a fit Hugh Jackman was, but this movie is so joyless. I don't mind a sad or bittersweet ending, but the whole thing was depressing. Why did Logan and Charles have to be fucked up throughout the whole thing? Why did they have to randomly introduce a nice family and then proceed to show them all getting butchered one by one? Why did so many grunts have to get sliced to bits, all the while Logan is getting painfully riddled with bullets? How is Charles even alive? Right, they resurrected him just to show him getting heartlessly killed by the person he cares for. Non-stop barrage of pain and anguish and needless killing.

Spoilers. 

OK. 

Two things bothered me.

1) When they had the funeral for Logan at the end and the girl said her piece. None of the children seemed to give two flying fucks that the guy that just saved all their lives, Laura's (was that her name) fucking dad, is dead. Not one of them seem to support her or do anything to comfort her. I know that they had a hard life, but that's just hard to believe that they'd just be like, ""whelp, time to go"". They just...didn't respond.

2) We never actually get to see if they make it or not. This, I think, was a mistake. Now, we don't need to see them settling in to their new life and a happy ending, but it would be nice to see them actually make it to their destination. The entire movie is the X-men team bringing her to Eden. They go through hell and we don't even get a chance to see the fruits of their labor. 

I realize that there are plenty of movies that leave it open to the viewer, but this isn't that kind of movie. This would be like watching A New Hope and never seeing if they blow up the Death Star or not. 

That, to me, is the only thing that ruined the movie. Otherwise the movie was super gritty and another perfect example that the R-rated superhero genre has a place. ",5x7z96
dgpyh1c,"Good movie, But constantly seeing how a little girl with knives on her hands kill highly trained soldiers like unarmed civilians really throws me off, like kind of ruined the movie in a way.

Kind of sucks getting a violent movie finally but he's old and weak and dying so it isn't prime Wolverine. I don't feel like he accomplished much in the movie either, he was mostly just present for a lot of plot points. He didn't defeat any of the lead antagonists. It kind of just goes from point a to B to c to D and oh hey we're done now. The whole thing was really carried by the acting by Jackman and Stewart. Didn't like how Xaviers death came out of nowhere with no real resolution. I don't know man, I'm really mixed about this movie compared to all the praise everyone else has for it. 

Hopefully a costumed wolverine is in Deadpool 2 in a cool fight scene. ",5x7z96
degblgf,"""Logan"" is a gritty film about Wolverine's final days. It tells a story about parenting, legacy, and finding value in life. James Howlett^1 (*aka Wolverine and Logan*) is a dying 200 year old man. He chauffeurs for a living in hopes of removing Professor Charles Xavier, his mentor, from society. ""Logan"" shows how ageing affects a person. James, Charles, and their pseudo-caretaker, Caliban, are all senior citizens. Charles' dementia endangers people, James healing factor is wearing off drastically, and Caliban is simply tired. Their lives change when a mutant girl named Laura encounters them in hopes of fleeing to North Dakota. James eventually discovers his relation to Laura, and they develop a deep bond throughout their journey. 

I'm not an avid X-men reader or fan. However, I found this movie to be quite emotional with a relevant message. The importance of having a family is explained very well in this movie. Other themes touched on include elder care, automation, legacy, and illegal immigration. I appreciated how this movie develops James and Laura's relationship. Once Laura's revelation and the main villain are revealed, the film becomes a character analysis of Wolverine. James battles are just as self-reflecting as his opponents and his ward. 

James Mangold does an excellent job directing ""Logan"". The acting is on par as well. Both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart return to form and deliver their best interpretation of their X-men personas. With all that said, Dafne Keen steals the show. ""Logan"" is her movie. She's the star, and how Hugh Jackman got top billing is beyond me. One issue I had was with the cinematography. There is a scene where the framerate and resolution noticeably increases. This also occurred in X-men Apocalypse when Stryker imprisoned Mystique, Cyclops, Jean, and Quicksilver. It took me out of the film for a moment. 

Overall, ""Logan"" is the end of Wolverine's tale in the X-men movie universe. It tells a relevant story about family, legacy, and relevant issues like illegal immigration. The movie's crew did a great job but the cinematography can be off-putting. I highly suggest this film be seen in theatres. 

Notes (spoilers below)

* Laura's move to Canada becomes more heartbreaking once her relation to James is revealed 
* The children were very reminiscent of ""Hook's"" Lost Boys. The character of Rictor resembled Rufio's a bit
* Reaver inductees will have to lose an arm in combat before they are accepted into the group
* The ""X"" grave marker ended the film on a somber note
* It's unsettling to think about how this film's portrayal of the future may actually occur  

^1 - James is used as to not confuse the film with its titular character",5x7z96

degng4h,"Really enjoyed the film, but one thing did bug me.

[spoiler How did all the other mutant kids make it to Eden alone? I didn't see any other adults there, and the manpower and effort they threw at just catching one kid in Laura was huge. Why didn't they just use Caliban to find the other twenty kids first rather than just the one who happened to have the protection of two of the most powerful mutants ever?](#spoiler)",5x7z96
degoetg,"MOST OF THIS MAY BE SPOILERS. 

I was hesitant in seeing it when people were like OMG it's like the Dark Knight. Uhm, not a selling point for me. 

BUT...I'm glad I saw it. It was good. It wasn't like the Dark Knight to me. 

I, however, wanted more mutant powers at the end. Not enough for me. Nice used of Donald Pierce (Hellfire Club...right?) and interesting use of a brain disease for Professor X. 

I don't like that he was used as the reason some of the X-Men died...though I understand they needed him to feel guilty, but it's just weird when you read the Comics. The X-Men are well trained in dealing with mental attacks. Meaning I don't understand how they would suffer death by Xavier. 

I didn't like Caliban being so weak. I don't like when people are in a world that's harsh and they have no way to defend themselves. It's weird. It's like watching the Walking Dead and people are all like Father Gabriel....weak. You're so far into this how can you not be stronger than this?

Anyway, I liked the film over all. It was very good. I teared up a few times. Professor X dying and when Wolverine died and X-23 said Daddy. Love the way it looked when Professor X would have a mental moment. visually everything was grating...as it should be. It was awesome feel and look. And Wolverine feeling pain was felt through the screen. Loved that as well. 

I would recommend anyone who loves The X-Men comics to see it. It is as serious as one wished the other films to be and funny as the comics allowed.

Fox is finally learning what they actually have. Finally.... ",5x7z96
degomff,"Tbh they missed out on an opportunity to get Logan to say ""STAY AWAY FROM MY DAUGHTER!"" As he lunged into that final fight.

Xavier killed 7 mutants at his school and a bunch of civilians, most of the mutants in the world are gone (dead? impotent?), a bad guy plan seems to be working at a massive scale to make sure no mutants exist.

1) [Donald Pierce](#spoiler) - the whole aspect of him and the [Reaver's](#spoiler) having [robotic/cybernetic implants](#spoiler). I get from a standpoint of callbacks to his character in the comics, but in this specific movie was there any real significant point to him have the [implants](#spoiler). At least in the comics those [implants](#spoiler) seem to grant them superhuman abilities. Does it necessarily do so in the movie? I just felt like they could've been just a bunch of dudes with guns. The [implants](#spoiler) didn't seem to add anything to those characters.

2)[X-24](#spoiler) - I really wish the character has OTHER powers aside from [Wolverine](#spoiler), because I feel like I've seen this exact same [fight](#spoiler) in 4 of the other X-Men movies. **X-Men** [Logan v Sabertooth](#spoiler) **X-Men 2** [Logan v Deathstrike](#spoiler) **X-Men Origins** [Logan v X-24 ;)](#spoiler) **The Wolverine** [Logan v Samurai](#spoiler). I get that those are slightly different [fights](#spoiler) but, I wish that this movie did something a little different. I get the point of [X-24 being a clone](#spoiler), but I still was personally unsatisfied

3) [Dr. Rice](#spoiler) - now here's a guy I wonder why I should give a remote shit about. Why not just make [Donald Pierce the genocidal maniac that he is in the comics](#spoiler) and leave this guy out? In the last bit of the movie he [passively mentions Logan killing his father](#spoiler) and then is [shot unceremoniously](#spoiler) almost immediately after. In literally all the times we've seen [Logan's origin](#spoiler) was there ever a time were a specific [Dr. Rice](#spoiler) was ever mentioned or seen? Wasn't it always [William Stryker](#spoiler) that lead that program? This was one character who....I just didn't see the remote point in.

When you let your animalistic side take over."" It just felt like ""oh, wouldn't it be cool it Logan fought a YOUNGER version of himself?!""

Imagine if it had been another member of Logan and Laura's ""family"" instead, like Sabertooth or even Daken. Then you could even have them try to talk to Laura and tell her let to cut loose and come with them, while Logan continues to try and show her that there's a better way.

delggsj,"I really enjoyed most of the movie, but didn't like the movie as a whole by the time it ended. Logan fell short in the third act so hard, that I fell there must have been production issues. I can't really go on without spoiling the movie so...

[The last third of the movie felt like stringed along ideas rather than one cohesive movie plot. Even without the heavy handed political commentary, there was just so much that didn't make sense, that it took me out of the story, and honestly disappointed me greatly. I think everything until right after the farm house incident was very good, and it kept my expectations very high.

The scene in the casino was absolutely riveting. That was the high-point of the movie. The tone softened, and lead to the farmhouse scene that outlines a life Logan could theoretically have. Cool. Then the corporate baddies come and ruin it, political, but still cool. But after that... What the hell? Just a list of things that don't make sense right off the top of my head. Eden is where all the kids are supposed to team up to avoid being killed. Directly south of Canada. This is a multinational corporate juggernaut that is hunting these kids, right? Unless Canada became some crazy superpower, those borders wouldn't mean shit to the people hunting those kids. Hell, they made them in Mexico, were in cahoots with the American law enforcement, why would they suddenly stop at some magic line? I was hoping Eden would actually be some sort of physical presence and not so much just an idea. Something that would actually deter the persecution of those kids. 

Also, they say the X-gene is no longer naturally occurring, but how? How did they get it to stop....everywhere in the world? Was it as an indirect result of what professor X did? If so, maybe they should have elaborated that further. Where are the rest of the old mutants? Why is Canada now magically safe? What the fuck was that green stuff Logan injected into himself...it was like he already knew what it was... What the fuck are those kids going to do while in Canada? Why aren't all the kids speaking broken English with a Spanish accent? Why was Logans kid the only one being hunted down? How the fuck did the other kids make it all the way to the Canadian border without the help of one of the only mutants left? Why did it matter that these kids were hunt down if they already have the product they wanted? (The other Logan) So much didn't make sense, and didn't piece together, that it just frustrated me at the end. I wish that Eden was actually a safe haven, that an explanation was provided as to how the kids got to where they are going safely, that a motivation to recapture these kids was actually outlined, (this could have been neatly tied together with an actual Eden in Canada) that the political heavy-handedness was more subtle, that Logan died actually handing these kids off to a sustainable future of the X-gene. I wish they had redone the end, or if the ending was redone, an explanation as to why they shat all over the ending.](#spoiler)",5x7z96

Though I have to say I think it pulled a Suicide Squad on us in a way. The trailers made it seem to be a quieter movie than we actually got. I have no problems with it at all since I enjoyed it. But between Hurt and the slower tone of the trailers and the talk of how it was influenced by westerns I just thought it was going to be a quieter film. 

At the same time though I have to say James Mangold did a fantastic job of trying to balance the tone and the over the top violence. I understand them doing what they did because it was their one chance. They nailed it.

However, Logan kills several of these people and they don't fall down, implying that Professor Xavier is freezing them by telekinesis which is not one of his powers in the movies.

delxaur,"Probably my favourite Marvel film. It was a 10/10 up until the kids game. They were completely trash. Also, Logan's sickness was ex machina, but I guess they needed that to kill the series. Still left with so many questions, but again, they just wanted to finish things.

8.7-9/10",5x7z96
deg2sxf,"I liked it a lot. A LOT. Action sequences were awesome, the gore was amazing, x23 actress was fantastic, it was heavy, deadpool scene was awesome, writing was very sharp and tight, directing was great as was acting. Even the editing was amongst the best i've seen in a blockbuster. BUT, it has story problems.

For one, x24 sucked. I was really let down when he came out, and although their fight was really cool, it was anticlimactic. I'm glad they didn't go the route of another monster or robot but this wasn't much better.

Next, i thought both deaths were handled poorly. Charles especially, they just threw him away bc they needed to further the plot. Logan's healing factor not working wasn't properly explained imo, and the fact they kept bringing up the adamantium bullet kept bringing forth the doubt that he couldn't die without it. And then a fucking tree branch kills him. 

The cross --> X was perfect, but I think the death would have had more weight if it had more value. In the comics, i think he dies of having liquid adamantium harden over him. It assures that they will stop making clones of him and he gets his final wish, to die, without it feeling like a cheat code where he can't die except when he can. 

Overall, i would say its an 8 or 8.5 out of 10 but it was so close to being a 9 or 9.5

I think its a perfect sendoff to hugh jackman the actor, but not wolverine the character.

* Violent and brutal. Even uncomfortably so because of the children.
* Set pieces borrowed off of Mad Max was well done and still unique.

* I don't really care to watch a nihilist lead for 2.5 hours of my life. The movie put an end to the Xmen, had a heroic ending or whatever, but I was not happy with the film. Basically, there is a reason that stories like Macbeth/Hamlet sticks to your mind, and being a nihilist old man isn't part of it.

delpj3u,"First of all the film was brilliant and i loved it despite any critique. i still think its the best wolverine we've ever seen and everyone did an amazing job.

The GOOD:

Dafne Keen was adorable and perfect, Patrick stewart as an amnesia ridden guilty xavier was painful and touching and Hugh Jackman was weary father personified. 

it was a despair ridden movie but very cathartic and i'm so sad to see hugh and patrick not play their roles anymore.

Hugh and Patrick are so damn fantastic and i really had hoped for them to continue with the movies, though this was moreorless the best xmen ending we could ever get.

the fights were vicious and subject matter darker than sicario

The story was brilliant and there was so many touching scenes that really caught my throat.

The BAD: 

politics. lots of politics. the film is literally about a mexican illegal immigrant that spent her entire life in what seems like a detention center with no rights. she's broken out and flees across a leftists nightmare of america and only gets freedom in the oasis of canada. Its not enough old man logan to be old man logan and its too hyped up fears of real world for me not to notice that. i felt uncomfortable in the sense that it was like a worst of all worlds depiction but they didn't take it far enough. They should have shown the tragedy of xavier or logan destroying the school for mutants. That would have given some cathartic release to that tension of just not knowing what happened. same reason i couldn't continue with leftovers. it just too tense not knowing why.

The UGLY: 

bad guys weren't really all that, besides x-24 (shades of superman 2 where logan is fighting with his nihilistic self) both the doc and boyd holbrook were okay but forgettable. i didnt get why the reaver team all had shitty prosthetic arms instead of just being normal humans as it didnt seem like the metal arms conferred any advantage. 

For some reason the most terrifying bit in the movie alzheimer's and child detention scenes not withstanding, was probably the bit where laura gets her stomach pierced or the bit with the freeways and the automated driverless trucks. 

that really freaked me the fuck out because its so close to being a reality, its like that i-robot bit. cargo just plowing into other drivers without a care in the world and going super fast.

the GM crops thing i get, and the idea of the population being ""vaccinated"" against being a mutant with gene therapy from eating corn syrup was a hugely interesting take on how a population could get forcibly sterilised from mutant variation.

the biggest and ugliest travesty though was that there was no hope at the end. they buried wolverine but they didn't give that moment for x-23 and the rest to see their eden and show it. they gave a children of men ending which really fucking hurt. 

you don't know if those kids will even survive on their own out there or if its a trap giving canada was origins of weapon x program. 

thats the painful bit i wish they cleared.

dehsxaj,"After watching the movie I have a few questions:

- Why did Logan and Xavier degenerate so much in this timeline as opposed to the Days of Future Past timeline? Sure, the events have changed but their biology is still the same. The explanation in this movie is that Logan's sick due to the adamantium, but obviously he also had adamantium in DoFP and it didn't affect him the same. There's no explanation for why Prof X's mind has gone so downhill.

- X-24 is killed by an adamantium bullet to the head, which essentially blows his brains out. Logan is shot in the head the same way at the end of the first Wolverine and his head is obviously still intact, he just loses his memory.

- Where are the rest of the X-men? AFAIK Prof X ages the same as everyone else, and he was already fairly old in (the future portion of) DoFP so all the other X-men should still be alive, right?

- The technology in Logan is mostly identical to ours today. DoFP had flying ships and very advanced robotics (sentinels).

dektoof,"Loved the film but came away with one big question.

Was Logan being poisoned by the adamantium or what ever wiped out the mutants?

**Admantium**

Personally I don't like this explanation. It feels out of place for the regenerating abilities we have seen from Logan. He has been able to fully reguvenate as he is being burned, survived bullets to the head etc but his body cant stop a slow poisoning effect? It feels like a bit of leap.

**Transigen virus**

I may be getting it wrong on what this actually did but the film seemed to hint that transigen released a virus in the corn syrup that weakened and then eventually wiped out mutants powers as well as stopped them from giving birth to mutants. Could Logan have been infected like everyone else but his healing abilities slowed the process down. By the time we see him in the film his healing is close to gone. I know in the film at one point he looks at his claws and says I know where this poison in me has come from. But couldnt that mean the people who did this, not the actual metal itself? When he sees the business card for transigen security head he knows about the company and freaks out, so he knows who these guys are and that they have a connection to some shady anti-mutant stuff.

Just as a side note to this, does Canada use corn syrup to the same extent as America? This could be why there are rumours of Mutants still being in Canada?

It makes perfect sense too, because his character is based around him trying to get away and no one leaving him alone. It would be pretty fitting that, even in death, no one can let Ol' Wolvie rest.

Plus they never really explained his illness, and we have the mysterious Canadians.

deg24b0,"**Some major notes:**

•	As a male in his mid-20’s I have to admit I find female characters, when they’re written and acted properly, to be far more compelling and interesting. Males only have so many roles they can fill (the lovable rogue, the man with a dark past, the wise and kind old man) but I feel women have so much more room for development – maybe because there is such a deficit in developed female characters. The movie was as much about Laura as it was Logan and I was so drawn in by her character and found myself missing her when she was off-screen.

•	The R-rating was absolutely warranted. I was a bit apprehensive about it at first, but I don’t think there was a moment that felt glorified, gratuitous or overstated. The violence – which was in abundance – was impactful and necessary. By the end I didn’t really ever get used to it, which is how you know they did a great job with it.

**Some criticisms:**

* The film is probably too long at 141 minutes. I don’t think any of the scenes were unnecessary but some sections definitely overstayed its welcome, and one of the reasons was because Logan was constantly passing out. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare relied on this technique a lot.Towards the third act, Logan literally passed out and woke up at least six times in half an hour. Whenever this is used in movies, it forces the audience to reset – this probably a good reason why the third act felt so flat because it wasn’t given the opportunity to ramp up to a satisfying conclusion. This is no way means it ended poorly – far from it – but the landing was a bit bumpy.

* Dafnee Keen is such a fantastic child actress, right up there Eleven from Stranger Things and Abigail Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine. I try not to be too critical of child actors, but the other children paled in comparison compared to Keen (whose parents are industry veterans).
Villains are always such a disappointing part of superhero movies, and of Marvel movies in particular. While the parts were played admirably, the two antagonist were your typical amoral or evil for the sake of it cookie cut outs. Unlike others, I didn’t particularly mind Jackman playing X-24, something symbolic about it I suppose and it was a genuine shock when he appeared in the farm house. It also made farmer’s last moments really meaningful (see standouts)

**Standouts:**

* I think my favourite scene would have to be when Laura first spoke to Logan outside the doctor’s office. The two arguing in the truck, her finally speaking and Logan telling her to “shut the fuck up” before she repeatedly punched him in the face was genuinely funny.

* When the farmer’s father rammed X-24 with his truck and unloaded the shotgun into him and then turned around and tried to shoot Logan, I thought it was brilliant. The fact that he tried to pull trigger – even though the audience knew it would be futile – was heartbreaking. ",5x7z96
deg2lxd,"7.5/10

A lot of great scenes and it was great to see how X-Men powers would look if they weren't in a PG-13 movie. Very brutal.

The middle section was kind of slow and I had some problems with the explanation on what happened to the rest of the mutants when there's no way Xavier could have taken out every uber powerful mutant in one go when there are definitely more than 7 of those. 

I wish they had also made it clear if Logan's problem was treatable if the X-Men were still alive and if he cared to get it fixed. But that is a self complaint.

As a whole a good movie and it was worth watching.

I dismissed the death thinking it was just a nightmare till i realised it was X-24 and then it hit me like a train that he actually was killed. The fact it was done by the wolverine clone also made sense since any other time Professor was in danger he paralised everyone around.

In almost every aspect conceivable it was a retarded item,both from a logical standpoint, for being an obvious mcguffin, and from being a really shitty way for a guy who can be killed by normal damage now to commit suicide.  As soon as X-24 appears you know exactly what the bullet is going to be used for, which makes it a pointless story tool. More, it makes no sense at all from even the most basic level. Up to a certain point a bullet being harder helps transfer more energy into the thing being shot rather then deforming the bullet, but at the end of the day the actual power of that bullet is going to be pretty close to any  other bullet you can fire from a hand gun. That it magically blows clean through adamantium is rather silly. I am willing to suspend disbelief over a lot of stuff, but that bullet on every level was a bad idea to include in the movie.",5x7z96

deg0vos,"Alright, I'll post half of this here and half on an answer to this one because my review got too long.

In short: I almost liked this movie completely, but some things ruined it for me.

Okay, I went afraid to see the last of us movie for the same reasons I was afraid to see where the story of the last of us game was going, was it better than I thought? Actually, in a lot of ways, yeah, but that was for around half of the movie.

Before anything else, I'd like to say that the dubbed version was INCREDIBLE and rewarding, and I also saw no problem with the kid's acting, though to be fair there was very little of even the main girl. It is definitely a must see from Wolverine as Hugh Jackman could really act the shit out of the burden Logan carries from emotional scars to the pain he feels on every hit, it is enough to carry 75% of the movie alone and worth seeing just to that, but the other 25% almost ruined the experience for me, there was a moment that if I wasn't with my friends I would likely walk out of the theater because my writer side got literally offended. Also the action is pretty good, when Wolverine jumped with his claws it made me almost moan like a little girl that learned the wonders of masturbation.

The director's intention was to write a close, personal history, which it was REALLY FUCKING WELCOME after the spectacle creep of X-men Apocalypse, but the thing is, whenever the writers at fox attempt that, they fuck up because they don't know how to blend super powers with emotional issues save for Wolverine, and wolverine is always a cheap card on the character angst box, if you fuck his struggle you're dumb.

You have an almost immortal being that loses his loved ones through the passage of time.

You have bad things happen to the people he loves.

One of his super powers was put to him through pure torture on what might as well be a nazi experiment... TWICE on this fucking series.

""You poor... poor man""

Seriously, Logan is so easy to sum up and summon those feelings that scenes of a minute can be heavy and emotional through continuity. That is why the scene in days of future past weights so much just from flashbacks when the professor is seeing into his head, that is why despite the whole thing about Project X coming out of nowhere in Apocalypse is paid off by a wild battle of a rebel wolverine meeting Jean Grey.

But they still fuck up on this, because the x-men are made to deal with epic levels of threat and shit, but the writers can't link this to characters that symbolize oppressed minorities and have disturbing pasts because ""people are the real monsters"".

So to tell this personal history that could happen at any time in the x-men history (considering they didn't die), they choose the end because they need to limit the number of characters saying ""there are no more mutants"", which is bullshit.

There is a saying in writing that comes a lot, which is, ""people don't care about unlimited power, they care about the person with one bullet"", so they get all those gods and have to limit it. Which is why the x-men franchise always writes itself into a corner, or it is a brand new world where new mutants are introduced to the school (X-men 1, 2, Apocalypse, first class, Wolverine...) or it is one where the mutants are going to be extinct (all the others, I guess), there is no fucking middle term with those people, and if they thought they could get away with it by placing it into the far future with little kids, good fucking luck.

If the point of the other kids in this movie was to make them with limited power, all they needed was for the evil corporation to reinvent the ""cure"" from x-3, this gives the guards an actual threat level AND as the effects where clearly not permanent in none of the movies, say that they have a medicine (like in this movie) that allows to force their powers, but not much, so say, Scott has only 5 shots every 1 hour or whatever.

But no, they made the adamantium start killing Logan slowly and Professor have a brain disease, WHICH WOULD BE FAIR GAME, if they didn't kill all the mutants because of reasons. They did try to imply that Professor accidentally killed the team, which would be fair, and actually a nod to one of the comics this is based on, buuuut no, they needed to do it with ALL THE MUTANTS.

And that is a heavy issue for me. The antagonists... are horrible. They're generic Ajaxes, which is quite weird because they could link both characters.

The first one is hilarious, he is actually great as a character premise, he has a great wit that comes toe to toe with Wolverine in conversations.

""...And then you shot her?""

""I didn't shoot her! Did you!?""

""Heeeey I asked first XD""

He actually idolized the X-men, yet he thinks he is in the right side, kind of, and he is extremelly afraid of X-23. he has a robotic arm, you could perfectly throw away in one line anywhere that the reason he has a robotic arm is because of her. Yet they didn't.

He is just there to send more and more red shirts to be sliced by the Wolverine, and the writers are aware of that, that is what annoys me the most. ""That is how dumb they are!"", professor X says.

And it doesn't stop here.

The evil scientist dude that looks like Christopen Walken in the dark somehow made mutants stop being born or something, when he starts to try to explain his backstory on the third act Logan just shoots him. It is comedy, a nod to the fans to take ""Yeah... you didn't come for that, you came because the main characters and they had to need an opposing force because super heroes"", but if you think even a little about you see them looking away trying to admit ""Yeaah.... we didn't really know why we put him here...""

The ONE reason why he was needed was because X-24 only listens to him, and they... ""tried"" to make an emotional connection between both of them, and I truly gasp at saying ""tried"" because that is a movie that should have emotional connections more than any other in the franchise at its core.

If I sound pissed, it is because there was barely any. But let's take the elephant shit out of the room first. Remember how this movie got R rating because Deadpool? Well, you would be glad to hear that Deadpool IS in this movie.

Fox decided to pay a tribute to the Deadpool from the first Wolverine movie, you know, the one that has no personality whatsoever, and is there only because the writers ran out of ideas of how to actually be able to face Wolverine.

Now, I know what you would're saying, ""Why should I keep listening to this guy beating the best Wolverine movie when I could be masturbating to the screenshot of that one girl that shows her breasts in this movie?""

BUTT

Keep with me for one more second: I'm aware the clone was supposed to represent what Wolverine was in physical strength, the beast only magneto could tame, or Colossus... or Xavier... or Jean Grey... or Hank... or... anyone that could be in this movie instead of him.

X-23 already represents the emotional AND the physical point of wolverine could be... if the adamantium in her skeleton allows her to grow and not let her die in less than 5 years. It is even a fucking theme in the movie, that Xavier says there is no reason why she can't be better than Logan, and that is a nice point. Logan suffered so much, maybe he can avoid that in her, they both don't trust anyone but she in this movie is his daughter, she may live a shit ton of time or may not due to the adamantium.

Why a clone? Didn't project X had an adamantium claw lady in x-2? Didn't we have sabertooth? Deadpool? Or even a Rogue if her powers fucking work.

There is no reason why you can't find opposition by not using other mutants, especially since in this movie and deadpool they talk a lot about controlling them, or that they almost did with Wolverine in Apocalypse. There is no reason why they couldn't use it in there.

Imagine how epic would have been beast or any other x-men out of a box being controlled going after them.

If you want emotional connection, why don't you throw Rogue in it? Say the X-men scattered after the even Charles caused. Rogue now has her own family, she deals with taking away her power with the medicine Hank never bothered to fucking use on her.

deib2kh,"Great sendoff for Hugh Jackman's iconic role. But thinking of it as a part of the role's legacy, something that feels weird is that it doesn't really add anything other than finality to a franchise that will continue in a time before it.

As a standalone film, it was very good. Not great, because there were certainly flaws, but still very good. But it's hard to look at it as just a standalone since there have been eight movies that have come before it that (kind of?) directly connect to it that are hard to ignore. So I think that it just felt a little off to me because of the lead in and setup, or lack there of and this having ended with such a strong sense of finality. One of the things that makes stuff like Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad so great is that their (season) finales come after fantastic penultimate episodes. The last we saw of the x-men was mediocre at best. And within that, the last we saw of Logan in Apocalypse showed him becoming Wolverine again, and yet now we jump to all of this, not really know what happened in between. If what happened in between was just one or two events, that'd be a little easier to ignore. But for decades to have passed and nearly everything we knew about eight movies worth (nine if you count Deadpool) to be gone, this seems to have come and gone at such a strong halt.

Again, though, I did enjoy it a lot as a standalone. The only thing I had a problem with in the confines of this one movie was that Charles was so far removed from the character that we used to know that it just didn't make sense. Everything up to the hotel scene was great for someone like him, but then stuff like carelessly putting a nice family at risk and then being killed off seconds after realizing what he did rather than getting a chance to redeem himself didn't do justice to the character in my opinion. But besides him, most of the rest of the film was solid.",5x7z96

All the other children grew up in the same Hospital and were only speaking English. Why were they going to Canada in the first place?

deg4xam,"I loved the movie as well. I only have 2 complaints and one of them is very big for me. I´m usually not very picky with plot holes or anything but since Wolvie is a character that i love since i was a kid and in many ways shaped the way i see and face the struggles of life, it almost ruined the movie for me: [Before Wolvie dies at the end, the kids use their powers to kill Donald Pierce and when they see Logan fighting his clone x-24 they could have used their powers at least to ""delay"" him but they didn´t. That´s the thing that almost ruined the movie for me. I understand they had to have Laura kill him with the adamantium bullet and maybe they wouldn´t have been able to stop x-24 or even save Logan but at least they could have tried because seconds or minutes before they had dispatched of Donald with ease. Why not at least try the same when X-24 was dragging Logan through the floor? This could have been easilly avoided by having the kids run and either Laura staying to help Logan despite him telling her to run or have her come back so that they could have her and Logan alone with X-24. Then the kids could have come back to help her and Logan since he was helping them or she could have ran to meet them again or something. Maybe i am exagerating but it´s such a major flaw that i can´t stop thinking of it. The other one isn´t so bad and can´t really be considered a plot hole or an error which is the fact that the scientist died but they probably still have clones from Wolverine in the lab(unless x-24 was the only one) so the bad guys can still come for them cause in such a big organization they probably had members communicating with eachother at all times. But that one it´s perfectly forgivable and you can see a way out. The kids not using their powers when Logan was being demolished by the clone when they had just used them a few seconds or minutes ago is just awful and could have been fixed so easilly. I am surprised they let that escape in such a solid movie.](#spoiler) Anyway on a more positive note, hope Hugh gets an oscar for this performance and the next actor who replaces him in a few years does half the good job he did.

The characters are perfectly acted and the action scenes are excellent, but the story beats are like an unoriginal rehash of so many movies before it. For example, I think that with one minor difference, this is the exact same story as Mad Max Fury Road. I couldn't really get emotional about it because every emotional story beat could be seen from a mile away. Once I knew the goal the characters had to achieve, I knew the ending.

What I thought worked very well, aside from the action scenes, was the setting and the actual setup for Logan himself and how he is incredibly tired of life. The bleak, weary Charles was a more interesting character for me, though, since the only emotional connection I did feel from this movie was [seeing Charles in his dementia-addled state, reduced to a wreck of his former self. but that was completely thrown out the window once he needed to be a character.](#spoiler)",5x7z96

I love Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the Wolverine, and Sir Patrick Stewart's portrayal of an aging Xavier. However the rest of the movie seems flat and empty.

Maybe it was the intent, but most of the ""important"" deaths in the film were unceremonious and without much gravitas.

It was my understanding that the main bad guy in this film was the doctor who started this obscene child soldier project - Instant death with no follow-up. The one-armed enhanced solider, Pierce, seemed to get the worst bad guy death even though he was just the Right-hand henchman.

I feel like this film was just a flimsy excuse to take the training wheels off wolverine, and give him one last slashfest before retiring Jackman.

[Throughout the movie the children who escaped from the Alkali/Transigen facility are attempting to get into Canada where ""it's safe"".  This implies that whatever government/corporate entity in the States that is attempting to harness the power of mutation and use it towards the ends of creating soldiers is unable to operate over the border into Canada.  This is further supported later in the film when both Dr. Rice and Pierce are attempting in earnest to get to the mutant kids ""before they get across the border"".  We also know that these are the same people that engineered the veritable extinction of naturally occurring mutation through use of gene therapy in products available to consumers](#spoiler)

[So, if this is the case, why are there no more mutants in other countries?  If Alkali/Transigen people can't even send operatives or get Canadian governmental cooperation to kidnap/extradite/kill the Laura and her friends, how in the hell did they convince them to administer secret gene therapy to the entire world?  Shouldn't there be, at the very least, a few Russian, North Korean, Iranian, etc. mutants running around?

I was really excited for the new Wolverine movie and got really pumped about it when the first ""Logan"" teasers and tidbits started dropping. The first reviews came in, and I was really happy that they were great, as I had been waiting for a new, really good superhero movie for a long time.

This last sunday, I finally went to see it with a good friend of mine, who is a big fan of the X-Men series as well. We even went out of our way to go to a screening in English (I'm German), just to experience the movie how it was really meant to be.

We were both utterly disappointed by the movie. From very early on in the movie, we were giving each other looks of ""Jeez, why is this so bad?"" regularly. There are a lot of things we had issues with that made the movie very un-enjoyable for us. Just to name a few:

- We felt like the movie lacked a proper setting. [You just get kinda thrown in the situation where Logan and Dr.X are dying, with no explanation as to why they are, how that happened or how it is possible for Wolverine to be in the process of dying at all.](#spoiler) 

- What I heart a lot about was how the movie was very ""emotional"" or ""emotionally straining"" and brought people to tears. Now, usually I'm a very emotional person myself and I enjoy movies that put emotions and relationships of whatever kind well in scene. But every scene in ""Logan"" that I guess was meant to be emotional felt really fucking cheesy to me, to the point that I was cringing really bad, [for example at the scene where Laura turned the cross on Logan's grave sideways such that it was an ""X"".](#spoiler)

- The acting wasn't that great, if not bad. Of course, Jackman and Stewart both deliverd solid, above average performances, but nowhere close to what they have shown they can perform in the past. And Laura was really hard to watch, sometimes I felt like I was watching a parody á la ""Superhero Movie"" when she was on screen, for example in the scene where [Logan wakes up and she is standing on the rock waving.](#spoiler) 

There are a couple more individual scenes I found really painful to watch, but I'll leave them be for now.

Now to my question: What in particular made the movie enjoyable to you guys? Did you maybe perceive the things I listed in a whole 'nother context that puts them in the right place? In general, why did *you* like the movie? I'm genuinely interested in your opinion because this is the first time my opinion about a superhero movie  heavily differs from the general consensus and I would be happy if I could rewatch it with your guys' point of view in mind, maybe so I can enjoy it myself then.

8) how were all those mutant kids not able to take down a few of those pussy army guys on their own in the forest?

dek1st1,"The movie was on another level till the moment they all have their last supper together.  From then on I felt it got rushed to a predictable ending. I think they should not have killed Charles abruptly like that. They could have emotionally sunk us, if Charles bleeds out in the van, during their escape act and commit Logan into making his last promise to take Laura to Eden. They should have shown the rage and then some bonding between Logan and Laura , instead of Laura taking the wheels and rushing it through to Eden in a blink of an eye. It would have been much better than to show all that treatment Logan gets from the kids. Of course in the climax, show the final rage and despair of Logan and end him.

dehrlns,"I liked it, but I'm still not exactly sure how much. One thing I can say for sure is that the action improved significantly with a bloody R rating, which really did need to happen. I enjoyed the mostly serious tone, but the moments of levity often seemed kind of strange and out of place, and honestly unnecessary. I want a brutal and dramatic film, if I wanted jokes I'd watch every Marvel Studios film so far. I also must say I loved the focus on character over being a pure action film. The performances (specifically from Jackman and Stewart) were great as well. Unfortunately, it had a lot of problems. First of all, I felt next to no legitimate developed connection between Logan and Laura at all honestly. He distanced himself emotionally from her for most of the film and then out of nowhere he's willing to do anything to save her. Didn't feel all that well developed in my opinion. One of the criticisms I have isn't really the movie's fault, that being that one of the primary praises I heard was that it stand on it's own just as a film, rather than being a comic book film. I have to say I disagree with that a lot, specifically with the clone villain, (whom I will bring up again) and all the sci-fi elements involved with Alkali labs. It didn't hurt the quality of the film but clearly I was seeing something else from the people who were saying that. I didn't really know if I was supposed to laugh at some things or not. When he's going up the elevator and his face is pressed against the buttons, I thought that shit was hilarious, but it was part of such an intense scene, there's no way it was supposed to be funny, right? My entire theatre also laughed when he started hitting the truck with a shovel, which comes literally right after Charles' burial, so I really doubt that was meant to be a moment of comedy. Once again, not necessarily the movie's fault per se, but it definitely didn't help.

One thing squarely set on the film though is how bad the villains are. Donald Blake? He's some military guy with a robot hand. Dr. Somethingorother, some scientist who was responsible for the eradication of mutants (?) and is the father of the doctor who put the metal in Logan's claws? (which is the dumbest reveal ever and had no point to exist and added literally nothing of value to the character) And X-24: A younger clone of Wolverine who's angry 100% of the time. Utterly stupid and tacked on just so Logan could have someone to fight in a one on one who's actually a threat. They could have just had this pseudo-military research group be the villains but they added this stupid clone thing. If you're a fan of the X-Men movies you probably now that Alkali Labs = Alkali Lake, where Logan was turned into The Wolverine, which is completely good enough. But also adding that this doctor guy is the son of the original dude, that's just silly. 

Now I'm not sure if I just missed something, but what was up with those coordinates from the comic book? They used those coordinates from the book, but is there actually an Eden location there? Or is Eden fictional but they used those coordinates in order to meet up with each other after escaping? Not completely clear on that.

Even with all these complaints (along with the fact that it felt it dragged on near the end) it was worth a watch and a more than fitting send off to the old X-Men cast that people actually care about",5x7z96

Keen(Laura),Jackman, and Stewart's performances were great, but the story had so many plot holes. The trailer of this movie was better than the movie itself. We've seen Wolverine killing people nearly every single movie, and I really thought they would've made this a story about him swearing off violence until the third act. The gritty violence and gore was what people wanted, but certainly not what they needed. I wish they would've made this a story where Logan was battling the theme of suicide more heavily than just a bullet in his pocket. The film would've been so much stronger had the villain been a telepath that made Logan kill Xavier and by the end after rescuing everyone, he'd tell Laura to leave, and load the adamantium bullet into the revolver and with tears in his eyes ""I'm sorry"" BAM cut to black.

deju4w2,"Small nitpick regarding X-24 (the Logan clone). In my opinion, unless he was just temporarily down for the count, the notion of only needing an adamantium-tipped bullet to kill the clone makes progressively less sense the more I think about it. I'm disregarding Wolverine being shot with the same thing in Origins, and merely ""losing his memory."" No, it's mostly regarding just how long Logan's been alive.

A coated bullet implies that the only thing preventing someone from killing Wolverine is getting through that steel skull. But Logan has been alive since before the Civil War - and only had implants since the 80s. With all the wars he's lived and fought through, with how many deadly situations he's casually thrown himself into, there is no way that in 200 years he wouldn't have taken damage to the head at some point in time. And if that were the case, he would have died way back on the beach at Normandy or something.

However, in fairness, I can't think of a good way to remedy this in the context of the movie. I get that it's a liberty taken for the sake of the story. It's just a little nagging detail that's been at the back of my head since seeing the movie.",5x7z96

Charles berating of Logan was annoying and kinda confusing. He is full of compassion to the ponit where his best friend almost destroys the world 3 times and he still hangs out with him but Logan not caring; that is too far for him? There is a lot of eluding to what happened to all the mutants but nothing was explained which is weird since it is such a large plot point. Laura going from mute, to Spanish only to fluent in English depending on the whims of the plot was nonsensical. X-24 was just stupid. What was that shit? Also it is redundant to to do back to back films of logan losing his powers as a major plot point as well as losing the will to live. Especially since the last movie made him decide he had a reason to live. Furthermore, the green goo of power was there so that Logan can kill a bunch of people for a few minutes. I do not know why Logan says that the goo makes you go crazy when we don't see that side affect at all.

On the movie side of things, Logan's character arc makes little sense. He really just randomly decides to save the kids. A lot of the film felt pieced together and I felt like I watched an 8 episode series that was fan cut into a movie.

On the positive side of things. The acting great, the music is upfront and good. The action was solid even though it was kinda brutal for brutal's sake. Laura was a fine actress which, for child actors, shows that the director knew what he was doing. You can see the passion that went into this film. The scene where Logan is destroying the car with the shovel is extremely well done. Set pieces were well done and overall okay film. Nothing great, nothing terrible. Just fine.

I'm a casual X-men fan; I've seen every movie, but have not read the comic. I didn't think this movie did a great job of developing a believable relationship between Logan and Laura.

He was a mind reader. And he's really old. I thought he would say something like ""Oh, death is finally here. Oh, never mind. I lived my life and I have no regrets.""

And I have to say, I'm less satisfied watching Wolverine dies. Yeah, I know he will, because it makes no difference if he survived and move to Canada with the kids. He's been living for almost 200 years. He knows quite clear that shits happens on anyone he cares about. That death is his only destiny. Unlike Rambo, he has nowhere to return to when the war finally ends. He doesn't have families waiting for him. When Rambo walks down the road leading to a house, I was really happy for him for he finally has his retirement. He's got to reunion with his loved ones. The camera is not following him, just like the endless nightmare letting him go. But when Wolverine dies, he just dies. I don't feel he and X-23 are bonding like father and daughter. It was a sad ending. Yet it was the only possible ending.

Another thing bothers me is Dafne's (X-23) high pitch voice. I thought she wasn't going to talk the entire movie. When she started screaming names, her voice sounded weird to me. As mind twisted as she is, at least like the setup is assuming, she sounded to much like a grown up. Her characteristics is not well developed in the movie too. Performance is OK though. Does the actor speak Spanish? I can see that mouthing is not 100% correct.",5x7z96

In fact, I think his final performance as Logan is admirable. I've always loved his performance in the films. 

So why don't I give a shit about Logan? I left the theatre kinda numb, like I just saw a car accident and didn't get out to help.

Problems with the film:

The script. It wasn't perfect.

A large portion of exposition is told through the nurse's iPhone. She's not only a nurse but also a master Adobe premiere pro editor. That video had so many shots where surely she would have been shot for filming such said events. this threw me off.

Wolverine relationship with x-23. It never got a chance to really breathe. I wanted more out of their relationship. Not just those last moments.

When professor x dies. It had no weight. I mean I guess we find out that either he or Logan killed everyone at the mansion but I didn't really find it all too encompassing. He went out unceremoniously.

Bad guy. Who is the bad guy? I mean cute blonde boy doesn't really do much of anything except look like a cute blonde boy. The doctor that's layer revealed to be big baddie, I couldn't give a shit about. Too late in the script. In my opinion, cute blonde boy should have had more to do, rather than ultimately becoming BANE part 2.

When Logan finally dies, I didn't cry like I thought I would. I wanted more. 

Sadly, this is Hugh's last time as wolvie and I'm pretty bummed.

I'm prepared to be crucified or Branded with the cross turned to the side.

I also never felt any particular bond between Logan and the girl, largely because she barely says a dozen words (in English anyway) throughout the entire course of the film, and a mute girl who spends 95% of the film doing nothing but snarling and looking angry doesn't create a strong emotional connection.

Logan just met up with someone chasing Prof X - next scene lets drive straight to him, X sometimes randomly explodes but then doesnt take his pills [what are they anyway, anti explosion pills from any hospital?], X takes pills seemingly to subdue his talents but they still work], Logan lets the kids just run into the arms of unknown people, etc.), the world was just a backdrop without reason (why is Prof X south of the border if crossing the border is seemingly no problem at all? Why would crossing to canada make a difference?), the timeline is a mess (Are we after DoFP [where everyone was alive and well, just 6 years ago], or in a different one?), the Universe is down the shitter and noone seems to care (Weapon X project is alive and well, Logan just doesn't care, no more mutants and none of the existig ones notice/care [e.g. Cerebro/Caliban before Logan]), Character motivation was all over the place outside of 'i am drunk' (Why did Logan change so much from DoFP to now? It is hinted that X killed some mutants, but why did that change Logan? Why didn't X-23 & Mini-Magneto look for medicine for Logan? Why didn't Mini-Magneto use his powers to help himself or stop X-24?)

I want to like this film, but let's be honest it is riddled with problems. Starting from trailers and other marketing materials, it was shoven down our throats, that Logan is going to be SAD! And I think they overdid it with the tragedic aspect of the film. I would say it was pointlessly tragic. 

There are characters that are just shoe-horned in, for example the evil professor - WTF? Why was he there? 

Talking about this Laura character - the actress did a fine job, I really started caring about her from the first minute, but I just can't cope with the fact, that she miraculously started talking in the last third of the film. It seems like screenwriters could'nt come up with dialogue for Laura, so they made her mute.
But overall, I liked the main characters, chemistry between them, the dialogues, monologue, the setting and the morale of the film:

degpckc,"The sick part of that is more than likely caused by the adamantium poisoning, it's even referenced in the film. 

In X-Men #25, when Wolverines adamantium get's ripped out by Magneto, his healing factor subsequently improves, so it's implied that his healing factor is constantly fighting the adamantium poisoning. 

So I think in Logan it's just gotten to the point where his long exposure to it has pretty much worn down his healing ability.

Then him being suicidal is, as you've said, the mental strain of being alive for nearly 200 years and all the terrible shit that has happened to him during that time.",5x7z96

dek5bl4,This is the sort of info I came to this thread to find.,5x7z96
dened71,"I think this movie is set in a different timeline that pretty much ignores every movie past X-Men 2 (to my knowledge the only events in previous films mentioned in Logan is the Statue of Liberty fight from the first film and Stryker being killed in X2) and instead substitutes a ~~darker~~ *less dark* (remember in DOFP a near-apocalyptic war which not only killed off most mutants but also a good number of humans was supposed to happen by this time) timeline where bad stuff starts happening soon after that movie. Logan himself mentions stuff being bad for the last 25 years (or something along those lines), and seeing as the movie is set in 2029, that would put the divergence at 2004, just after X2's events.

So the Logan in this film never saw the future war where the Sentinels kill off the X-Men and anyone else they're sent after, he never killed Jeanne on the Island, and he never woke up in a perfect 2023 where everyone he saw die is alive and well in Professor Xavier's school (who is absolutely perfectly healthy himself).

Sent back in time to 1973 as of 2023. Age: 191

Lived 1973 to 2029 (56 years).

Died age 247 (accounting for time travel) or age 197 (not accounting for time travel).

The time travel method used sent back Wolverine's consciousness (not his body) and dealt additional mental damage, possibly physical damage as well (unclear). So you're correct that his body was physically 197. However his mind was 247 and god knows what a consciousness transfer from your 191-year-old mind to a 141-year-old mind (50 years backwards! 50 years of changes added!) does to your brain, which controls regulatory systems all over your body and presumably the healing factor is going to be affected by mental age to at least some extent... So because the mental likely affected the physical significantly and there's a 50 year gap between mental and physical, his physical age isn't a perfect measure of his condition.",5x7z96

dehd8a6,"I think that's one of the stronger points of the film that some people can just reflect on. As sad as it is, the ""villain,"" who was pretty much a product of the world's crimes against him and his family, wasn't really wrong, but he was still a threat. It really depends on how you look at him, though, because while he's certainly an antagonist, he's not entirely to blame. Still, the whole sad thing is that Logan's just struggling to get by as a limo driver of all jobs to get money to buy a boat and sail out to sea with his only two mutants that he can call a family. The way he struggles to help Xavier run away with him, even going as far as to fold and pack his wheelchair in the middle of danger, just emphasize somewhat of a father-son bond between the two, which we really didn't see. That dinner scene emphasized it. I guess after the ending, you realize it wasn't what you'd expect from a comic book superhero movie, at all. There's no saving the world; it's just a man trying to save what little family he has left while struggling with his past catching up to him. Getting a boat wasn't going to solve any of their problems, as Caliban stated in the beginning, but it's all Logan could do. In the end, we see that the heroes *did* kill the enemies, but the end is still unclear. Xavier died, pretty much all the mutants are dying out, Caliban sacrificed himself, and even Logan finally met his end. Arguably one of the strongest X-Men, he finally died, and it wasn't to change all humanity or really make the future better. All he did was save the one world that actually meant to him at death; Laura. While their future is unclear at his death, that's the end of his legacy. Logan did all he did up until the very end, and he can finally be at peace knowing he won't have to mourn for anyone, anymore, and that it's his turn to be mourned.",5x7z96

Maybe it has something to do with knowing that the villain will fail to destroy the world. I don't know. Dr. Strange was fun but I definitely feel like it was lacking in the villain department.

degodaw,"This was mind-blowing for me. Your comment opened my mind up to entirely new reason to appreciate this film!

This plot element is all only implied, meaning that no one open-monologued about how mutants were slowly wiped out through unknowingly ingesting a chemical inside their foods that ""castrates"" their abilities. We, as an audience, are allowed to infer that from casual genuine conversations that the characters share. The same exact thing happens with the small hints at what happened with the X-men. No one ever shouts the plot reveal for the audience's benefit. No. All we get are vague news reports, Logan's restrained guilt-ridden disgust for Charles, and then the therapeutic, weeping coming-to-terms moment from Professor X, which he never even fully has.

To me, the simple nuance this movie was allowed is incredible! They were finally able to ""show"" the audience the stories that make up this movie, ""not tell"" them through the usual, cheaper means. God! This movie really is brilliant! ",5x7z96

Thats free money right there. I can see them trying to convince Jackman and Steward to at least allow them to use their likeness.

Knowing that he destroyed everything he worked for, the xmen, and not even of his own volition.

In my opinion, it was probably the most accurate depiction of a near future. Not too much has changed, but there are slight changes that make the world just a little bit more mechanical and grey, from the self-driving lorries and the crop field equipment, to the augmented limbs.

I thought that he'd pass away somewhere away from danger, or he'd die after intentionally releasing one of those seizures so that Logan and X-23 could kill the Wolverine clone while he was pinned down somewhere. 

Dying peacefully or sacrificing himself. Although it was a terrible way to die, it was one of the most realistic deaths for a superhero to go. I almost cried when I thought about him in the First Class-Apocalypse films, we knew him from the start. ",5x7z96
deife1h,"Choked me a tad when she called him ""daddy"". Because you go into it knowig that there's the emerging dad/daughter dynamic and that their relationship as such will develop throughout the film, but it actually happens very slowly and spikes sharply at the end. She doesnt even talk for the first half of the movie, and only when she does can any sort of bonding really happen. And so the whole movie goes by with their relationahip not really establishing, but it does at that moment when she loses him. It fast tracks it, jumps over all of the small print of human bonding and cuts to the chase. And that's why it's so hard-hitting, I think. She only gets to have a Dad as she loses him. ",5x7z96

You would put wire frames into the molds and pour this gel substance into them and ""bake them"". Out would pop X-men figures.

I am praying to every being I don't even believe in that we see Daphne Keen come back as an incarnation of Logan. If she can bring it in future films as hard as she did in this one she will be a crowd favorite for years to come. So don't fret, I have a feeling the ride isn't over yet",5x7z96

dehqigf,"Dude this part might have hit me the hardest. 

It wasn't confirmed that she knew during the film, and I was waiting for some kind of reveal. But the fact that she just knew the entire time makes it more emotional for me. It's like they both knew, and were both kind of skeptical and getting to know each other and actually learn to care for each other.. I mean, she takes after him lol 

And then she calls him Daddy and it's the only time you see her cry, and then Logan says ""Laura, this is what it feels like"" and has the first actual genuine smile he has in the whole movie. 

I think it's one of the first times I've cried in a theater. ",5x7z96

- Prof X killed the last of the X-men. It's implied that was his first ""seizure"". The irony of a man who uses his mind to bring mutantkind together developing a mind disease that becomes their ultimate demise is palpable and heart wrenching.

- The symbolism behind Logan fighting his former weapon X self is awesome. It really shows he's been battling his own demons his whole life, even to the bitter end. I also think his acceptance of death at the end and trying to save the children...it helped him realize that he *did* change.

They have Logan's DNA to create clones, so i doubt Laura was the first nor the only one. It seemed like Laura was the one they were trying to raise and develop to be a weaponised mutant they could control, as opposed to just straight cloning wolverine from scratch who might be unpredictable.

It was left slightly ambiguous as to the specifics, but generally yes it's implied Charles had a psychotic episode and must have killed anyone in the vicinity except logan.

While I'm fine with X-Men being more kid friendly all the Wolverine's should have been dark and violent since the beginning. I think they really lost a lot of money and opportunity with this franchise.

I think the trilogy would have been better with it STARTING with this movie, followed (how he dies), then followed by finding his origins vs. Sabertooth and Lady Death Strike, followed by the Japanese version (Silver Samurai) where he finds love only to flash forward to remembering holding hands with X-23 and he says ""This is what it feels like."" and he dies.",5x7z96

Laura and the mutants were dehumanized all their lives and Transigen tried to turn them into weapons. But the comics taught them that they were worth something, that they were people, not things. The comics taught them about heroism and gave them hope. And that's the message of the X-Men comics in real life too. The X-Men are about people who are oppressed and persecuted because they're different, all coming together, trying to build a better world, and becoming heroes.",5x7z96

So Laura turning the cross was a final message that to her, he was the Hero that she read about in comic books.

Her friends are all she knows in the world with Logan gone and they're all going to be gone much earlier than her even if they last a full lifetime. Do you think they're going to bring in Sabretooth or Daken? As far as I know, Sabretooth had no rapid-healing children and Logan had no others in the same universe aside from Daken. Even if Laura doesn't get along with Sabretooth or Daken, at least she wouldn't be so alone. I do know that they were originally thinking of bringing Liev Schreiber back for a brief cameo in Logan to help them out of a tight spot after Xavier dies but they dropped the idea because they decided that would take the focus off of Logan and Laura.

deke5tn,"Except they are two separate films that try to do completely different things. Logan is a film that draws from the laid multifaceted groundwork of the X-men movie universe and grounded it with finality and tragedy. It succeeds largely thanks to its focus on the character dramas and its more mature approach to comic book violence. 

BvS on the other hand had to work with much more ambitious objective. Unlike the Marvel movie universe, which built toward its hero assemble film with individual hero films, DCEU needed BvS to lay the foundation for which it will build its individual hero films around. Snyder had the difficult task of trying to achieve multiple goals. He had to set up a much darker approach to the universe in which its hero populates to distinguish the DCEU's identity from Marvel. He had to make a Batman film that's different from the already immensely popular Dark Knight Trilogy, making it different yet somehow try to remain true to what's well known. He also had to make a film that had to manufactured a fundamental conflict between the DC's two most popular characters, and somehow make it substantial enough to cause a ripple through its subsequent individual characters' films. To this end, I felt like Snyder was mostly successful. 

Logan is about finality, while BvS had to build a beginning. So if Snyder had to take notes from this film, he would have not succeeded what he was tasked to do. So when you said ""This is how a character with decades of character development is subverted to make a redemptive story. This is how realism is done well in a dark and gritty film."" I agree with you, but it would not have been the appropriate approach to BvS. ",5x7z96

Uh, you do realize Wolverine was almost 200 years old, right? Is this the first X-Men/Wolverine movie you've seen? He was born back in the late 1880s. He has extended longevity and aged physically very slowly due to his healing factor. It would be the same thing for Laura. She'll aged physically normally until she's a certain age, her 30s maybe, then she basically won't age *much* physically anymore only very *little* once she gets up to her 100 somethings and basically the same thing may happen to her because of the adamantium in her body. But it's only in her hands and feet, not her entire body so it may not affect her as much if at all. If you're wondering why the adamantium poisons them it's because it's metal and it would poison anyone who's body it's put in. Their healing factors are so strong though that it is constantly able to heal from it and have it not affect them, until they get really old and it gets weaker so it's not able to fight it off as well anymore until they succumb to it. That's what happened to Logan in the movie. Laura may live a bit or a lot longer than her 200s, because it's not in her whole body but it's still in parts of her body so we can assume it eventually will kill her too but a bit or much later. Even if neither of them had adamantium put into their bodies, their healing factors would still get weaker eventually and they'll die from a what a normal human would die from like 300 years old or something like that. But the adamantium was put into Logan's body in the first place to guarantee that no one or no thing can kill him in by blowing him up, decapitating him, cutting him in half, etc I assume. Their healing factor is superhuman longevity not immortality. ",5x7z96

Made it more heartbreaking IMO. Like it was so devastating that even Wolverine didn't want Charles to know about it or that Charles was so wrecked with guilt that he felt a good night's sleep was something he didn't deserve.

A real super hero movie wouldn't be wrong by trying to have more drastic world ending events. That's why they are super heroes and why in the comics there are often world ending villains. 

While I sympathize with the whole Reddit view that there shouldn't be Conquer the Earth plots, that's what comic books are. Ignoring that would be a betrayal to the characters themselves. 

After all, Old Man Wolverine (Comic this movie is based on) was Logan dealing with the aftermath of a post apocalypse setting. All the heroes killed off and villains conquered the planet.

That aside, Logan was a good film. Grounded in a more personal view. While it doesn't follow the comics exactly, it's a real treat that can pull in viewers with its heart and history of the Wolverine character. ",5x7z96

dettslu,My understandint on why that shot even killed him is that the flesh can heal but the adamantium can't. So the bullet fucked up his metal skull and it would just stay that way. And the reason why the claws didn't do enough damage is that he just doesn't have enough power in his hands. Compared to a gun. It reallly is like trying to pierce plate armor with a sword compared to a gun.,5x7z96

Therefore with no serum he stays dead. ,5x7z96
detyzya,"The idea of an adamantium bullet killing him is based around pretend physics. The idea is that even though adamantium is the strongest substance on Earth, Logan is still limited by his own muscles - he can only hit things with the strength of his body, which is not enough to cut through adamantium, so he could never hurt his double with anything other than stabs or cuts. A bullet on the other hand hits with more force than Logan ever could.

However, Logan regularly cuts things that would be impossible for human muscles to cut through anyway. Also, the way adamantium acts in the movies means it should be hard enough that a bullet shouldn't be able to penetrate it, no matter what it's made of. It was fired from a revolver, not some fission powered super-gun. *Normal* bullets will sometimes bounce off of a skull, never mind indestructible bullets and indestructible targets.

It doesn't really make sense but it's necessary for the plot.",5x7z96
detpo05,"Maybe it has more to do with the explosive force combining with the Adamantium in the bullet that causes it to do more significant damage than simply stabbing with a claw?

If they want him to stay dead, then yes.  He healed from the adamantium bullet, because his healing factor was still working at full power.  Adamantium poisoning over 50+ years eventually weakened his healing factor to the point where it could no longer heal him and the green juice overdose overclocked him to the point where the healing factor fully gave out.  Also, X-24 was dependent on the green juice (maybe intentionally), so won't be resurrecting from that headshot.

If they want to bring him back, then they could handwave it any number of ways.  He was only mostly dead, and his healing factor very slowly brought him back to life.  Magneto finds his grave, rips his adamantium skeleton away from him, and then he heals.  Etc.

degii68,"Considering they're all dead (in this movie) and Logan is pretty much done and only has 1 thing on his mind (get that boat, wait for Charles to die, and then shoot himself with an adamantium bullet), I'd say it isn't out of character for this Logan to be reluctant to help Laura.

Also Logan realised how big of a shit Laura is in (Reaver dude comes by his car and pretty much threatens him), I'd say he's justified in not wanting to be a part of anything that'd get Charles or himself in trouble. 

Also he does protect Laura in a way. Instead of handing her over near the beginning at their warehouse (the part where she's eating cereal) he keeps saying she wasn't there. If he really didn't care, he'd have just turned her in right there and then.

dei1rym,"I agree. Each characters is portrayed well by the actors, but it's the development of their relationship being a bit lacking. Logan was quite distanced from Laura nearly the whole time, it feels forced when they are bonded as father and daughter in the end. Still, it's a decent movie though, I was just expecting a little more. It was definitely a right decision to make it a R rated.",5x7z96
dehxcz0,"I agree with your criticism here. The lack of a true bond between Laura and Logan really makes the movie lack the pathos it needed. Also, if you think about it, Logan feels *almost* pointless as a character in a movie centered completely around him. Laura is so self-sufficient that she can easily defend herself against a handful of armed guards, she can drive cars, and most importantly, she doesn't seem to need any kind of emotional support like you usually see with the father/daughter archetype. Sure, she kind of seems to kind of get attached to Logan and regard him as her father, but it's unclear exactly *why* she feels this way given that Logan himself shows absolutely no warmth toward her until the very end. And if you imagine he wasn't there at all, from an emotional perspective Laura's journey to Canada would not very be challenging because she isn't emotionally vulnerable (like a little girl who had never been in the outside world *would* be).

I think what they needed with Laura was completely tone down her badassery. Like maybe portray her wild action scenes as some kind of latent combat training that activates automatically, and then once the action dies down she panics as she looks upon the horror of what she's done. Then they could've gotten Logan to care sooner and try to shield her from the carnage and attempt to comfort her, etc.

Overall I don't think the movie completely falls on its face; it accomplishes a handful of things it sets out to do, but I'm really disappointed that it could've been so much more.",5x7z96

difuf1w,"Days of Future Past retconned Origins so take Origins with a massive grain of salt. There isn't really a good explanation for why an adamantium bullet kills a dude who tanks nukes, it just does. 

The question I can answer is the Adamantium poisoning, having a heavy metal, especially a fictionally heavy literally indestructible metal covering your bones is fatally toxic. Logan's healing factor had been fighting it every second of every day. Notice how he didn't age a day for decades upon decades until they put it in him and suddenly he starts getting old? He was born in the 1800s but stayed 30 until like the 80s when they adamantiumed him up.

If he didn't have it in him he probably wouldn't have aged and died, or maybe he gets killed earlier by something he can't handle without an indestructible skeleton.",5x7z96

3. Old British Doctor explains, again the final battle sequence, that he did something to the DNA of GMO food to stop new mutants being born.

1- The gene therapy, distributed in drinks and foods, was not only suppressing the mutant gene on reproductive cells it was affecting already born mutants with the gene. Xavier brain deterioration was a side effect from losing/weakening his powers. 

2. Adamantiumis poisonous Wolverine and X-23 are some of the few that can handle the coating because they are constantly healing himself. Again as he was also exposed to the corn syrup on drinks, specially whiskey he was weakening his healing factor and dying as a result.

If you can make perfect clones why are you impregnating Mexican women? I get that X-24 is hard to control but it seemed like they were doing well enough with dealing with that given that. 

EDIT: I understand X-24 came later and I'm not saying that the movie didn't tell us why the plot was happening. My point is that from the perspective of storytelling it stretches disbelief. It's a huge leap to go from impregnating women and raising the kids from babies to straight up perfectly cloning mutants who they raise to adulthood immediately. No cloning project is going to have full-term babies as the phase-one with perfect adult clones being phase-two, there's a ton of steps in between there that lead you from one to the other. 

If they were only 10 years away from perfect clones why bother with the more risky and resource intensive Mexican lady impregnation?

Not only did they do a solid job with this film, but set up X-23 in an interesting and compelling fashion. I won't pretend to be as interested in seeing Dafne Keen compared to Hugh Jackman, but if the next film is an X-23 character film, I'll come out without any real reservations.

I think Logan is the best X-Men film so I'm not sure how to recommend them... But all the original trilogy (X-Men, X2, X3) were retconned, so they're not necessary viewing to get a bigger picture.

My favorite of the new trilogy is still First Class; if you like that one, Days of Future Past is pretty good and follows FC chronologically. Apocalypse is the final one in that trilogy but it was pretty objectively awful. 

I thought all the Wolverine movies were terrible except Logan.",5x7z96

The best movie you haven't seen is Days of Future Past, in my opinion. But you need to watch First Class to be introduced to the ""Past"" X-Men, and a movie from the original X-trilogy to get familiar with the ""future""/current day X-Men. I strongly recommend X2 for that purpose. Watch those before Days of Future Past to give it context and for you to have some emotional attachment to the characters.

Apocalypse is a fun X-Men adventure, as is The Wolverine 2013 is a fun Wolvie adventure. Both films could've been much better, and suffered from uninteresting and cliché villains, but were they're really good ""take your thinking hat off and grab your popcorn"" movies. Much like the majority of Marvel movies.

X-Men (2000), X3: The Last Stand, and X-Men Origins: Wolverine are all quite skippable. Most people would say these are not good movies, but I would defend them as competent popcorn movies. The first film gets more praise though, but that's mostly because it was the introduction, the first competent attempt at a modern superhero movie, and for launching the franchise. It's a bit dated by now, so if you watch it inherently, and out of that context, you'll find a more film like Apocalypse more fun. X-Men started it all, but it's a bit dated, especially the effects, which were actually good in Apocalypse.

Watch X2, then First Class, then Days of Future Past. You must. If you feel like adding in any other film to the list, watch it in release order.",5x7z96

That was the end of that timeline.

The new timeline which branched off 1973 when Mystique sparred Trask, is the timeline where Apocalypse happened in the 1980s. This also must be the timeline where Logan takes place, because it's the only timeline that actually reaches 2029. Wolverine could have visited Japan in both timelines. Who knows just what Wolvie was doing in the 50 years between Apocalypse and Logan.

He was going to be there for help. Now that you mention it! I wouldn't swear to it, but we thought that would have been an interesting thing to do. And then for whatever reason we didn't do it.""[116] Director James Mangold explained the decision to cut certain characters from the screenplay, stating ""There were times early on in the story where I played with the idea of Hugh coming along, and I don't want to give away anything, but I played with there being an underground railroad where there were a couple of other mutants that he met on the journey.

That Professor X is suffering from a degenerate brain disease is ironic - his extreme power is also an extreme vulnerability. It's this vulnerability against something so ordinary, so natural, so...uncaring and pointless that matters.

The point is that the driving force of both Professor X and Logan's demise is not some baddie or serum with a super evil plan but just simply time and their own humanity. 

They succumb to the forces of nature that will eventually take us all. 

They are more like us than the previous X-films (and the in-universe comics that are referenced) have led us to believe.

(Yes Logan is suffering from adamantium poisoning but both X23 and Logan himself say that he's given up - that's what's stopping his healing factor from overcoming the adamantium.)

The film looks at this uncaring, unfair, void of a universe and follows Logan's attempt to create meaning for himself. The real battle isn't with Xander Rice but with the meaningless and cruelty of life, and the importance of the meaning we hold in family, each other, our own caring.

Yeah I agree, I mean I enjoyed it but felt it didn't live up to the hype - if a movie has adult violence, then it should have adult plot details.  Some complaints:

 - first is why the FUCK are all the bad guys carrying guns, when they are trying to CAPTURE these ""assets""?  They all should have powerful tasers or net-guns or something, I mean what the fuck how stupid are these guys?  Oh but then they couldn't have had the ""cool"" body-count cause those action scenes would have been much shorter.  This really hurt the movie for me more than anything else.    

 - how fucking long could that train have been?  Even if it was an above average they are out in the middle of nowhere it couldn't have been hard to follow them.  

 - as you mentioned, Logan's caution was completely random and seemed to just be whatever level was necessary to move the plot along or add content to the script/set up a cool scene - why would he not ditch the car ASAP?  Why did he let Laura out immediately, like at the gas station right after they were attacked ffs.  Why did they go do a major casino (and fucking made that asinine joke about ""parking it in front"")?  

 - his injuries seemed equally random, like we are shown massive exposed wounds on the skin that obviously penetrated very deep, but he's pretty much ok?!  

 - the baddies were just so generic, stupid, and boring - there are so many idiotic moments for the heros to turn the tables, from the opening scene where they have a shotgun to the back of his head and there's like a 1 second pause, why isn't the trigger pulled?  Or during the ending fight how does no one see Laura approaching from the side when there are like a dozen armed guards completely focused on Logan?  AND then when he fires the gun at the doc they just fucking stand there for a second or two instead of immediately lighting him up?!    

 - Logan seemingly teleported from the observation tower to the woods, he was looking at the convoy that was at least a mile away then suddenly he's alongside it slicing up people?

dejposn,"1. You don't need the spoiler tag in this thread.

2. He's 200 years old, just as we age our metabolism slows down, as he ages, his healing factor slows down. It was established in either X2 or Xmen origins that the adamantium bonding would slow down his healing because his body was constantly keeping him alive from the adamtium. It was poisoning him so part of his healing factor is dedicated to just keeping that at bay. Now fast forward 150 years and his healing factor is slowing down that it can't even keep up with the adamantium poisoning anymore which is why he isn't healing from his wounds as fast, his one claw looked infected when it got stuck and wouldn't come out, and they kept referring to a poison inside of him. 

Thats why the kids gave him that potion and told him to take it in small doses. That would give his healing factor the boost it needed without overdoing it. It wasn't properly explained why taking all of it was bad but I imagined it'd basically get him up to 100% immediately if you take it all at once, but then really slows down the healing factor afterwards as a repercussion. The kids intended for him to extend his life with the potion until he could find a way to get the adamtium out of just accept death but he went rage mode, took it all, basically became himself in his Prime but suffered the repercussions when his healing stopped after that. Logan basically knew after he takes the full potion, that was it for him, either the adamtium poisoning gets him or he dies from his wounds. ",5x7z96

Edit: Clarification

Edit 2: corrected numbers after watching film a third time since an arrogant twat below keeps denying this happened. Link with clip down this comment tree. ",5x7z96
denmmuz,"1. They're beaten and broken down, and Charles sees a chance for some normalcy again. I need to watch it again but I don't think they know at that point that Caliban is tracking them either. When Logan asks about him he's told that he was left in a ditch. It's been hours since the Casino and they weren't followed (Or at least they don't think they are). I think they all know the risk, which is why Logan tells them that they have to leave first thing in the morning. But it's a human decision to make, even if it's not the 'right' one. 

2. Xavier's powers seem to come and go. If he's sedated I don't think he can really use them. Either way he's an old man with dementia, I don't think he can just switch it on and off. 

3. I don't know, except to say that they've clearly been together as a group for a while before Laura gets there. I believe the nurse implies that everyone else got out together, with her and Laura being separate. 

4. This is just Cinema Sins territory. If they did there wouldn't be a movie. 

5. Xavier seizured under threat. He tells Logan that it was all he could think to do and hoped that Logan got there in time to do something.  ",5x7z96
denkjdz,"> Why didn't Xavier use his telepathic powers during the car chase?

Xavier was very ill on the brains, so it is possible he could not use his powers on command anymore.

> Why do the kids not act as silent and standoffish as X 23 given that they had similar circumstances?

They had each other to talk with I guess, X 23 was alone for the most of the movie with strangers.

> Why couldn't Logan and co just not get drive thru instead of putting a family at risk?

> Why did Logan and co. knowingly go to a family when they knew that killers are after them?

Xavier convinced Logan to do so. As mentioned already he was very ill, he probably could not think straight very much. He just longed for the food they would provide with the dinner.",5x7z96

The movie is based in 2029, and there has always been the time travel aspect that just makes everything else not even matter.

But this would have also sent his healing factor out of control, and again you have an unstoppable rage monster. They deliberately reduced the affects and controlled his healing with a serum, making him dependent on Zander Rice. That's why he listened to only Zander. Once Zander died, he was just a monster with no purpose, exactly what Logan used to be, that's why the final confrontation is more than just an action sequence, it's Logan facing himself which he's been running from all along. For the first time in front of Laura's eyes, he was the protector and the X-man she saw I'm the comics. Weapon X (Logan) is famously one of the most feared creations in the X-men universe being neatly unstoppable once he flies into a rage. Why would you want an exact copy of something that killed your father?

He spent the entire move denying himself, and that final battle he faced his greatest fear, himself and his nature. To me, that ending scene is one to remember. The X-men weren't bullshit, they were the line between mutant kind and extinction. Logan writes it off the entire movie because he doesn't feel he deserves that praise.

1. We saw a glimpse of what he once was once he took the serum. It was very temporary but it showed how powerful he used to be.

2. The reason he died in the first place was because his body was so weak. He wouldn't die at full strength because then his regen powers would have been at full strength too. He would and could only die once he was back to his weakened state.

3. His death was not a beautiful one. It wasn't a romanticized version like most movies make it. I actually liked that about it. Logan was a remnant of what he once was, and he died in the weakened state he was. Similar to the way Xavier died. I wanted to see Logan be more powerful for a fight scene as well, but I could appreciate that we never got to that apex. Reality is, Logan was a shadow of his former self (combat wise), and we can't wish it otherwise.",5x7z96
dh5pag9,"I agree with you.
Logan/Charles Xavier/Magneto were the trio that made the movies great.
Simply because Magneto was the villain, and Charles needed Logan to help him and they grew with such a great dynamic.

Also, to answer these questions. How many bones do you have near your stomach area? You really only have your spine. So it literally stabbed him through the kidney/stomach area, and because he took such a high dose of the medication.. he basically overused his powers and he wasn't able to heal his wounds. 
Yes, the villain who was chasing them was awful, he seemed to be more of a military in charge commando rather than anything. The real villain is the doctor who was trying to suppress mutant genetics in the general public by putting it into the food and then to also manufacture mutants and make them as weapons. It's fitting Wolverine killed him because Zander Rice's father was the person who helped put the adamantium into Wolverine, and he seemed to be the head of the project. (As only weapon X-24 would listen to him) So I suppose Wolverine killed off that project's lead.

But I suppose he was killed technically.. by the X-24 project. Not by anyone else, and that is because they kept trying to perfect Wolverine to make the perfect weapon. (Yay Deadpool?) Anyway, they obviously kept trying over and over again. Well they eventually killed Logan off. He wanted to kill himself anyway, he was honestly planning on in with that bullet. 

But to be clear ""The most interesting characters in X-Men"" is over.
No more Wolverine with Hugh Jackman. No more Charles Xavier with Patrick Stewart, and no more Magneto with Ian McKellen.

We're moving onto the next phase of the X-Men franchise, with The Dark Phoenix Saga. So be prepared for James McAvoy as a young Patrick Stewart, and Michael Fassbender as a young Magneto.. with Sophie Turner (God she's awful) as a young phoenix.

dehlhyw,"Just throwing Sabertooth in there would require a fair bit of screentime to develop to hope that it could have the same symbolism of Wolverine fighting his past to save his future. That could be good or bad and would involve cuts elsewhere that can instead be spent on our hero and his pathos directly.

Fighting himself rather literally is not only does this instantly but ups the symbolism to the max by having Logan fighting his own reflection. ",5x7z96
dehmemz,"(im not spoilering shit because the comment is spoiler. and this is a spoiler thread. read ahead at your own risk)

as for 2 i personally foudn it enjoyable, and unlike what another commenter said about it being like Deadpool in Origins, I didn't think this was a bad move. 

The way you want it would be kinda corny. I mean we know what life was like for Logan. it would just be a device to explain to audience that maybe didn't know. 

The way it was set up, she was a shy girl, who had gone through some shit. some shit we had seen throughout the movie. when she finally talks its like ""oh right..she's mexican...she speaks spanish"" 

And so the little english she does speak holds great meaning to the plot as a whole. Especially in terms of Logan doesn't want anything to do with this girl. 

You spend the whole movie thinking Logan is a cold jaded old guy. He doesn't want to have anything to do with anyone and I think the line towards the end perfectly explains WHY that is. 

""Bad things happen to people I care about""
""Then I'll be fine""

And he does fuck all about it. he just lets her go. And it tugs at your heart strings and it lets you continue to think ""okay yea, he's an old fuck who doesn't want to get someone hurt again"" and that's fine. and you feel for Laura.

and then when he sees her in danger, it clicks to him that's his daughter. And he does everything he can to protect her and the other mutants. And so it's not until the final moments of the movie that we get to see Logan truly give a fuck about her. And I  think it wouldn't be as meaningful to the audience if he had opened up to her before hand and had given a fuck before hand.

The accident at Westchester that injured 600, those were 600 students, likely kids because Westchester is the location of Charles' school for the gifted a.k.a. mutants. The 7 killed were the X-Men, and throughout the movie she clung to the hope that the X-men were real. That book was the hope she had in Logan that he hadn't had in himself. Branding himself an animal and running from his nature, X24. That's why he didn't confront him and take Laura back at the far, instead he thought of Xavier first. It wasn't until that final moment he told Laura to get behind him, I know it was ""cookie cutter action"" but in that last fight that was the first time he'd ever been her shield. Which is what the Wolverine always was in the comic books for the X-men. He jumped in to protect her without worrying about the danger, because it was right. She learned at the end he didn't do it for the money after offering it, and confirmed he'd sacrifice himself for her and her friends, regardless of what harm came to him. Confronting his demon killed him, but he died the last X-men she always believed he was.

deg920p,"I've never read that source material.  But the film made it clear, along with hints in previous instalments, that the adamentium was slowing poisoning him.  The time jump gave us the chance to skip the slow process.

As for Xavier, he is clearly cranky because he is partially aware that his brain is failing him in the form of dementia/Alzheimer's.  And this caused him to basically kill a ton of people...including the rest of the X-Men.  The meds keep him from losing control but his brain was still able to function at times.   ",5x7z96
deg8tr4,"I can answer a few of those questions, and they were mentioned in the movie. The year is 2029, so Logan is a bit older, that may be an affect. He's also mentally not there, and this hinders his problem. In a scene in the movie when he's in the doctor's office, the doctor says he needs to get checked up because something inside is killing him. This could be him mentally being unstable, which affects his powers, or the Adamentium, as Logan said in a scene it was poison that was put in is body.

Xavier is cranky because he's got Alzheimer's so that takes away a lot. He's afraid to use his powers because of his condition, and whenever he has seizures they're dangerous, and he was the reason the X-Men got killed off in the past. ",5x7z96

Yes, admittedly it's a bit of a stretch that a) they all made it there and b) it took Pierce and his crew so long to arrive, but I'm personally willing to let it slide. 

I think the third point can easily be explained by Logan not wanting to draw any attention whatsoever to himself or the Professor, so that when they retired to sea, they would be safe in the knowledge no-one would be looking for them. Stealing yachts or robbing banks is not really compatible with that. Though, he could definitely have gotten away with ripping off a few gang bangers like those in the start of the film!  ",5x7z96

1.) It was simply a story happening in another, seperate timeline. Perhaps one where the X-Men became celebrated heroes after the New York incident. This theory would mean that this is a true stand-alone story from the main storyline, and it would mean Fox could in theory bring back Wolverine if they wanted to recast him. 

2.) At some point, Xavier read Logan's mind and got so deep he found Logan's memories from the alternate timeline. 

3.) Xavier was actually mentioning the Liberty Hotel, the one that X-23 was hiding out at. Logan forgetting that he is in an alternate timeline, assume Xavier is just having a senile moment and is mentioning the incident from the first XMen movie.

If this is a metal that's basically indestructible, it wouldn't actually be able to poison him because it would never let loose any particles. It's not like if he had a lead skeleton and lead particles leaked into his blood. Lead poisoning only happens because lead is soft. Adamantium is the opposite of soft.

Also, from previous movies we know that Wolverine can heal fast enough to survive even (something like) a fire storm ripping his flesh off. Is this incredibly slow poison more destructive than fire?

The idea that the [food supplements are slowly wearing him down seems more reasonable. If the supplements suppress the mutant gene in new-borns they might slowly affect adult mutants the same way. This would also explain how most X-men are dead (beyond the Westchester thing) -- they might have been able to fight in the beginning but years of the supplement weakened them until they could be hunted down. The same thing essentially happens to Wolverine but it takes much longer because his healing factor fights even this until the bitter end.](#spoiler)",5x7z96

All in all, we'll probably see more of this future playing out with X-Men.

He has sort of a suicidal wish, so he might want to go there to die with him, in some sort of hermit way. Or maybe he thinks he'll outlive Charles and then he'll come back. Since he's been around for so long, he might not care as much about spending some time away from civilization. ",5x7z96

Long answer: Logan has his adamantium removed in X-men #25 by Magneto, at which point his healing powers increase. Obviously the adamantium in his bones was poisoning/slowing him down with it's weight and properties. X23/24 are the attempted revival of weapon X. They intended to correct the problems they had with the other. Laura however, is very much like Logan. She cannot be controlled, and her rage made her unstable. So instead, Zander engineered a clone dependent on him. He could heal general injuries but not traumatic ones to the organs. They do not kill him, but do leave him in a suspended state. His skull is the only other part of his body coated in adamantium unlike Logan. Without the adamantium infusion, he did not need quite such a powerful healing ability, that and healing too fast makes them uncontrollable when they fly into rages. So that is the long answer, control. Zander wanted to castrate mutant powers if necessary to bring them into subversion.

dek01kq,"1. It's intentionally vague. 

2. Answered your own question. 

3. It's basically up to the writer but in the logic of the films he can regenerate from a lot. Adamantium is one of the strongest metals in the Marvel Universe, so it being able to kill Wolverine makes narrative sense and it ties into his Adamantium skeleton nicely. 

4. He wanted to control the mutant population and have them be bred for government use rather than pop up all over the world randomly. He wanted to be the one controlling the bottleneck. The green serum isn't really explained but it just increases Wolverine's healing factor like a steroid or something, also watching the movie kind of answers your question about taking too much. There's a sign on the bottle that says ""not all at once"" hence warning him not to take it all, he does, bad things happen, it's not that confusing. Dr. Rice wanted them killed off because they ""had a soul"" and couldn't be convinced to fight if they really didn't want to. There's actually a line in the movie that says that specifically, so he bred a Wolverine clone that was mindless and would be a rage machine without a conscience. 

5. It wasn't explained in the movie. Also kind of inconsequential IMO. 

6. They're crossing the border into Canada, a completely different country. It's implied or explicitly stated that the mutant related stuff that's going on with the government is an American thing, so crossing the border means salvation from that regime. 

7. Yes. The X-men continuity in the movies is fucked up anyways so it's best not to think about it too hard. 

8. What? 

9. It's not really stated explicitly but I would assume she probably has the skeleton too as Wolverine did say ""Adamantium, the stuff they pumped in us"" when talking to Laura about it. About it her stunting her growth, that's one of those ""suspension of disbelief"" type of questions. Who cares? 

",5x7z96
dek0im8,"1. He has dementia or some sort of degenerating brain disease that made him lose control of his power. At some point they say his brain as classified as a weapon of mass destruction and he did kill the x man at the mansion.
2.  Adamantium is a foreign material on his body , the healing factor keep fighting it forever, also that scientist has been putting a chemical in food supplies that suppresses mutant gen and maybe makes current mutant weaker
4. using the corn/food supplies they wanted to repress random mutant emergence so they can create and control any mutant to serve their purposes, they tried with children but they lack the rage to fight  so soulless wolverine was the awnser. also they seem to be made weaker then regular mutant and the serum act as boost to their powers
5. no ideia
6. maybe canadians think they way the us is treating mutant is wrong ?
7. some were made not canon/different timeline but to an extent yes, logan lives thru 300 y plus saw everyone die, stopped the sentinel program in the past changing the future, then saw everyone die again when charles lost control
8. yes
9. huh that's right, nice point
",5x7z96
dek11xr,"1. I don't think Charles was on the run from anything. Early on in the movie, Pierce( Guy with the artificial arm) clearly states they knew where Charles was kept, but he did not care for it as it was not his objective. The reason Charles was kept secluded is also stated early on, ""a degenerative brain disease in the most powerful brain"". Which resulted in the seizures. Isolation is Logan's solution to keeping them and the general populace safe. 
2. Logan is still healing except at a much slower rate then his prime. Adamantium is a toxic substance to humans and cannot be implemented into a human without them dying. However Logan has a healing factor which constantly keeps the poisoning in check. However as with most things, age starts taking a toll on logan and subsequently his healing factor to the point that the healing cannot keep up with the poisoning. 
3. I believe, logan once had a bullet lodged in his brain at one point rendering him effectively dead. However once the bullet was removed his healing factor kicked in, and revitalized him. The aftereffects of the medicine didn't necessarily weaken him but reverted him back to the norm of the movie. The medicine put him back into his prime for a brief period allowing him to kick all sorts of ass but once it wears off he is back to his severely weakened form along with sever injuries. The log is the finishing blow. 
4. Humans have used gene modification to enhance themselves. So obviously having mutant powers can lead to incredible insights. As for the weapons, the children didn't like violence or lacked the aptitude for it which is why they made a clone of wolverine at his most violent.
5. Plot
6. Who knows, its one of the reasons I like the openness of it. Its unlikely everything is going to be okay after they cross the border but one can imagine.
7. Watch cinefix video on the logan timeline. 
8. Its the reason why mutants seem to have died off. THe corn syrup eliminated the mutant gene preventing new mutants from being born.
9. No idea here.",5x7z96
dek3io7,"1 Apparently, Professor had a degenerative brain disease that caused him to have seizures. Add that up to his brains power, and well it could actually destroy people. Which is why Professor X's brain was marked as a fucking dangerous weapon of destruction by the Department of Homeland Security. 

He wasn't really on the run but he was way too dangerous to be kept in the country. Rather being killed by the government, Logan put the Professor where no one can know where he was. No one can find him, nor no one can hear the vibrations. It was really convenient but well adjustable and useful at that. Regardless, Caliban the other caretaker and mutant tracker can feel the seizures. 

2 

Logan's adamantium has been known to poison him and deteriorate his healing factor indefinitely. It's been known to the comics. 

3 

To basically state, Logan can survive almost anything. The bullet to the head would not kill him but actually, do a major damage. If it was shot multiple of times, it actually is a serious wound. 

A Because of the serum that was injected into Logan's body, it was stated in the lost children's camp that if taken it would cause the person to go enrage and also deteriorate other abilities. If Logan took a bit, and not the whole. He probably would have survived. 

5 

Honestly, I'm not too sure about the kids finding that fortress, but I assume that the adults basically died like Gabriella. 

6 

The children actually got to safety because of a particular group on the other end of the receptor radio that the leader of the lost kids was speaking to. I forgot their name but they are well known as the Canadian Avengers to some fans. Alpha- Force or something.

Yes. They did. ",5x7z96
dek0eqy,"Mr. Sunday Movies just released a Logan Easter Egg video that may share some insight. I recommend viewing it otherwise here is best I can do:

1. Doesn't seem so much that he is on the run as he is unable to control his powers and therefore is a danger to everyone. It seems he was responsible for some tragedy that haunts him and while he is on the run, even though there are actual comic books about his activity, it doesn't appear that he is particularly famous/infamous so I don't think ""on the run"" is right term. Moreso, he is in hiding by choice.

2. Age and yes the adamantium poisons him and has always reduced his healing factor. It seems in his age, the adamantium poisoning is now winning the fight.

3. Without adamantium it is very high, very fast almost immortal. With the adamantium it is reduced and seems to have reduced him to the point of normal mortality. 
A. After using the serum for an extra boost it leaves you weaker than you start. So basically he is too weak for his healing factor to jump in and save him from deal from his wounds.
B. Answered in A.

4. He is son of a former Weapon X science and as in comics is part of team that makes X-23. Apparently the company had figured out a way to stop mutants and cunningly introduced that gene theory into the food supply (High Fructose Corn Syrup). They were making kids with powers cause they wanted powered people and figured if they grew them from kids they could brainwash them into perfect soliders. Seems the compassion of the nurses plus kids will be kids made them shit soliders. Thats what made them try X-24 which was to grow an entire adult who was mindless and only took orders.  Basically in Marvel world, the 1st Super Hero was Captian America and the Super Soldier program. It seems since then every scientific endeavour has been an attempt to replicate that. So far, across all movies and tv the following people have origins tied to trying to make Super Soldier's: Deadpool, Hulk, The Amazing Spiderman, Nuke, Luke Cage, Director Mace, probably Ant-Man. Everyone wants Super Soliders.

5. They have super powers. Who says they had adults? I think the issue was X-23 was the biggest threat and why they went after her instead of the others. They new only thing to stop their Super Wolverine would be another Wolverine

6. Cause Canada. Apparently Eden is real.

7. Yes and No. They have fucked with the timeline so much you should just assume that all the events happened but other events probably fucked up how they happen. Whats important is that in this time line at some point there were no more mutants meaning Xaviers School for Gifted Youngsters had to shut down.

8. They figured out a gene theory that stopped Mutant X gene and figured out a way to get it into food supply.

9. Looks like they only did claws from bandages. It would have been possible to do like segments with extra treatments in future as she grew. Rememebr it was all an experiment so the skeleton/claws probably a proof of concept that they got Logans healing powers correcly.",5x7z96

It's a shame they didn't make the fights between the two Wolverines more substantial.

It lacked the substance and grit of Winter Soldier's action, which is sort of understandable since Jackman and the girl can't exactly meticulously train to give every punch and kick the impact a film like John Wick could give, hence the use of too many jump cuts and shaky cam.

Ultimately the director confuses brutality and hyperviolence with quality. There's a point where gore becomes gratuitous and is used as an excuse to cover up clichéd action, instead of being used to add something to the sequence.

This alongside Professor X's seizures and failing mental health make me wonder if the virus in the food supply not only wiped out the mutant gene and prevented mutant children but also affected existing mutants powers.

The mutants we see (Caliban. Logan and the Professor) are all having issues with their abilities as well as age.  Perhaps the tainted food + adamantium are whats killing Logan's healing factor.

About your second point. For one thing they wanted to capture them preferably, as we can see when they get the order not to shoot Laura at the beginning. I guess while they failed to turn the children into soldier, they still want to use them for experiments. Also it seems they can't fully control X-24.

And, in, that context, it's a *fucking downer*. Xavier's dream did not come true in the end. The X-Men failed in their mission to save mutantkind and then died at the hands of their leader, and the man who brought them together (under a promise to Logan no less).

The X-Men aren't complete failures, of course. They saved the world from race war, nuclear war, Cerebro-gone-mad, a giant evil blue guy, and destruction via giant-robot. Mankind owes them its existence; but it repaid them by destroying their species. The X-Men's greatest victory was making the world a better place for their oppressors, and then they all died and only two of them survived and then they died trying to help some kids.

That is *stunningly* tragic, and as much as I can respect it for how bold it is, part of me feels it's a bit jarring given the tone of the movies before. Part of me also realizes it's going to be retconned away before we know it so I don't know. ",5x7z96

We catch a glimpse of the brutality to come from Wolverine, and it delivers. Wolverine's slashing through out the whole film is perfect, and for me it'll probably be unmatched for a very long time (as far as action/fighting scenes are concerned in superhero movies). 

I liked X23/Laura at the beginning. But then she began talking too much. There's a lot of emotion and understanding that can be extracted from a silent character, and I feel that was ruined about halfway through. Her fight scenes were cool and the connection she developed with Xavier was nice though.

The backstory of the children was unnecessarily told through Laura's caretaker's phone. The audience could have eventually figured out what was going on with them. There were a lot of missed opportunities for bonding moments. As an example, Laura could've showed Logan or Xavier the picture of her friends. From there, a few clues here or there could have given the audience enough information.

The Xavier / Logan relationship suffered due to the silly directing or script, or maybe both. Don't have to dig too deep into this one. Some parts were cheese and other parts were poorly executed. 

The main villain was okay. I thought it was a great scene when he gets into Logan's car for the first time and they discuss the women and Laura. But then he goes down the path of generic villain. Also, I think having X24/Clone was a bad decision. I guess one can argue that Logan was finally facing himself. But I felt that a stale character with only one purpose, in the context of the film, felt cheap and didn't really serve the plot. 

I wanted a slow and brooding western-esque  film. One that would take its time to build up to the climax. One with a tinge of thriller elements in the style of No Country for Old Men. Instead we got one with a promising start that goes down that all familiar path",5x7z96

It had the attitude of an old soldier who wakes up and realizes he doesn't wanna do his morning workout anymore.

I gave this film around a 5 - 6.5 (but I must make it clear that I am NOT saying that it's getting a 50% on a test, so-to-speak...in my book a 5 means a PERFECTLY FLAT measure. Not bad but not good, literally BALANCED).

>Logan and Charles being ""the old cowboys who don't have anything to live for until now""

Yes, an overused cliche and not done well here...not properly explained why they had lost such hope and will to live until pretty decently into the movie, and even then just not very impactful in my opinion. 

>Evil guy 1 and Evil guy 2 aren't memorable, unique, or even threatening.

Ya they sucked...didn't really care much for ANY of the bad guys really.

>The subsequent action scenes do nothing to change the formula from Wolverine slices and dices and gets shot at, and Laura goes apeshit.

LOL! Good summary...and the choreography as well as the filmography of it was 'cheaply done' too. 

Was kinda obvious that they just resorted to cheap camera angles and video editing to cover up the fact that the actual fighting didn't really LOOK all that kewl for the most part...little kid screaming actually got annoying after a little while.

Like listening to stupid little kids rage on Xbox Live. 

>I think they planned for the family's son to be about Laura's age, it would explain why she acted so strange around him. 

Ya that was kinda weird...looked like she had a possible crush or something on the guy...but maybe not...or is it...so much pointlessness there??

>Evil Wolverine is stupid, there are a million better ways to depict Logan's internal struggle, I already covered how bad the villains are.

Going to HAVE to disagree here...a WOLVERINE movie absolutely NEEDS some kinda badassery.

It was badass to see crazy wolverine fighting original wolverine PISSED THE PHUCK OFF B/C HE JUST LOST THE ONLY PERSON LEFT THAT HE CARES ABOUT...you can REALLY feel the pure RAGE when he went after the clone initially. Also, for some reason that clone actually looked BIGGER than wolfie...like WAY bigger...IDK maybe my eyes were screwing with me...?

>and he just had 2 days of constant rest and no fighting.

That's actually a good point...he was not only rested but they HAD been giving him light doses of the healing drug.

He surely should've been AT LEAST up to where he was prior to the first encounter with X24, and really he should've been BETTER off honestly...although I can make a compromise on 'just being the same'.

>I couldn't see the movie for anything more than an attempt to make a sad cowboy movie that couldn't even do that right before going back to the tired old formula of your normal superhero movie.

I think Imma use that particular phrase from now on to describe this move...a little bit of my own personal flair injected of course.

And really that's kinda what the movie was.

""Oh hey we gotta kill off these 2 MAIN characters of this franchise b/c of reasons reasons reasons...so let's settle on a Cowboy theme (sorta like how a frat party settles on a 'costume party theme' when they throw a costume party...it honestly feels like that's what the filmmakers kinda did), and now let's bring it back full circle to 'superheroness' b/c we don't want to go TOO far into Western territory or else it may backfire"".

At first I thought the clone was Daken, Wolverine's son, and that they had found a way to work him into the film as well, then I realized it was just a generic non speaking clone.

Wolverine is a rage filled guy. A short temper is a core part of his character.

>4.) Why did it take the corporation several days to get to Eden? You're telling me that in 2029, it would take an extremely wealthy corporation over 4 days to mobilize to EXACT coordinates? There was no more looking. They knew where to go. A forced inconsistency to give Logan time to recuperate.

Yeah, that was silly. They should have simply put the scene where Donald found the coordinates later. 

>5.) What the fuck is going to happen to those kids? They're engineered killing machines - is the Canadian government just going to put them in a foster system, or are they pretty much going to put them back into a similar observatory to the one they just escaped from as a necessary precaution?

I also found that the premise that Xavier wiped out the X-Men and corporations wiped out mutants with GMO food was weak. Idk if it was some kind of political anti-GMO statement (which would be dumb).

I am fully expecting the downvotes, but I thought this film was too bleak from beginning to end to really give you that satisfying feeling that great films give you. I don't mean every film has to have a happy ending; I felt satisfied at the end of *Gladiator* and *Saving Private Ryan* for instance. I think the difference is the relentless misery. It felt like too much, like they were overdoing it. I left the theater completely and utterly depressed. I feel like if your premise is that all the X-Men are dead, mutants are a thing of the past, you should have some kind of a swelling of hope at the end. Maybe Wolverine goes off with the kids and starts a new X-Men instead of dying. I don't know.

But really, how fucking lame is it that of all the great villains Fox has access to under the X-Men license, it was a fucking Wolverine clone that kills Wolverine *and Charles Xavier*?

1. There's more of answer in this movie than CoM. In CoM, no explanation was given whatsoever. At least in this, the Dr. explains he had a hand in eradicating all mutants so that he can control their birth. Mutants are no longer born - they are made.

2. I'd call Wolverine *anything* but a hopeful activist. Theo's character, along with Julianne Moore, were actually politically active. Wolverine was always being pulled into things until he started caring halfway through the movie.

dejur9b,"You have to know that this isn't a typical superhero movie, it's more of a personal story of great men far past their prime, both of which gave up having a family of their own due to shared circumstances and for the greater good. One has given up on people and is just surviving, the other is suffering from unspecified mental degradation in his advanced age.

The Logan you see here isn't The Wolverine. Wolverine was an unstoppable, unkillable force that sacrificed everything to save people. He is now a jaded old man suffering from the physical and mental abuse taken over all those years. He can no longer heal as fast as he did in his prime, so even exposing his signature claws hurts him long term.

He has given up on himself and the world. He's just waiting out the days until something finally ends his centuries of suffering. Logan is far older than Charles but doesn't appear so due to his previously miraculous healing factor.

You can still see hope in Charles Xavier, but he is frustrated by his inability to help as he once could. He's emotionally supportive, but a liability in all other ways. He has long been a father figure to Logan but taking care of Charles is really all that Logan has left to live for, his last real attachment to humanity.

The mental degradation is especially problematic since Charles' telekinesis and telepathic powers made him one of the most powerful mutants known. He still has the power, but without full control of his own mind he could easily do more harm than good, making him potentially the biggest threat in the movie.

This felt more like Watchmen than the average super hero movie. It's not about physical prowess.

There are some amazing action scenes, so it's not all dull and boring, but that really isn't the point of the movie, just icing on the cake.

Wolverine is a mutant who can regenerate wounds (has lived for hundreds of years), and during the 1970s (I think?) was kidnapped by evil scientist dudes who filled him up with adamantium metal (hence his famous metal claws).

They were the only two in the vicinity who actually had a psychic link with Charles (save for Caliban who could do nothing because he was locked up).

1.) He has known Charles longer

2.) He had a longer (possible) psychic exposure to Charles

3.) He has been the caretaker of Charles during his degenerative years, thus being exposed the psychic effects that could come about.

I'm not sure but i think there was a poison created to target the mutant gene. which is why they are all dead or dying. logans healing is whats kept him alive this long but the poison is winning over the healing. tho this would not explain why the tracker or Charles are still alive. maybe they found out about the poison before they ingested it? maybe Charles did ingest it which is why he is so f*cked up thru out the movie(most likely just old age)?

There is a story in the comics that this movie took insperation from regarding the death of all the mutants prier to this movie. here is a link to a youtube video. this guy is a huge comic fan and he explains his theory as to what happened to all the mutants. it is a longer version of what is just said about the poison theory but in more detail. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neBmu8VL7nk

dehuxrx,"But then again you need to take into account the differnce, I'll put everything into spoilers just to make sure.
[When it came to rogue he had no memories of his past. It was a different Logan, one that only lived for few years. Logan who didn't loose as many people. This Logan is different. He lived for 200 years, fought in war after war, everyone he knew and cared about died. A normal soldier starts to mentally crumble after just 30 days of fight time. Logan was way above that, he probably spent months or even years of fight time (I mean the time in combat, not simply when he was in war, the real combat, murdering, etc.). He went through worst wars in history. That is what you see there, he is not the same Logan you have seen in any other movie. Before he had Xmen who even after he remembered his past, saved him. But now they are dead. All he has is Charles and his past. He is slowly dying, he wishes to die, but he can't. Actually if you watch his reactions to Laura, it is not him not caring, it is him ignoring her. In the very first scene with him and Charles talking about her in the car, he says ""I don't want to talk about it"" and leaves. He intentionally avoids her. And you can see this through out the movie. When the clone kills Charles, after he get out of his shock you can see him stopping for a moment. Yes, he leaves her and goes to Charles, but before that he stops. He wants to help her, he wants to save her, but he can't do it. He can't allow himself to care. He wants to help her, but he forces himself to go after Charles instead. Yes, Charles is more important to him, but the very fact that he froze means he actually wanted to help. And later on when she touches his hand, you can see that he becomes vulnerable. He is being comforted by her presence. You don't feel like that when it is someone you don't care about, he actually felt like she was there. And then he couldn't handle the fact that he wanted her there and went into rage instead. That wasn't just sadness. Also also that forced sounding line about how everyone he cares about dies is actually not exactly what it might look like. It is more like an excuse for him. He is trying to justify his own fear of attachment to her. 
And last thing, this time about Laura. You are forgetting that it is not same type of relationship for both of them. For Laura, Logan was probably a hero. She read the comics, she believed he will help her, and she was dissapinted by him. Logan might have only known Laura for a short time, but Laura ""knew"" him for most of her life. What they suggest is that the nurse shown her the comics and she probably idolised Logan to be the great hero. It is even further shown by how angry she gets when she sees what he became and the fact that she calls a man she only met some time ago her father. It's the thing i liked the most about this, her reaction to real Logan. And the ending was even that more exciting for me because at the end, she got to see the ""hero"" Wolverine. All her life she believed that Logan is this great hero and now she seen him as someone who only seems to care about himself. But at the end she gets to see the hero, the person she read about in comics, guy who charges in to save her.](#spoiler)

dehu1pt,"I think the ending was fine because she knew the whole time from Charles that Logan was her father.

dehulse,"Overall, I have to agree with you. I think some of the hype behind this movie may have raised my expectations too much, especially with lines like ""This movie transcends the superhero movie genre"". It was a great film all in all with fantastic acting and some beautiful cinematography.  

And although I'm glad that we were shown how Logan is old and tired instead of constantly being told by other characters, I do feel like it was overplayed a little too much. I guess I just would've liked to see this R-rated Logan at his peak more, but that's not the story they were going for so I can't really fault them for it. Yet I still feel like Logan [went out with more of a whimper than a bang and while it was still emotional, it wasn't as satisfying as I hoped it would be](#spoiler). And yeah, I felt that they played up [Laura's relationship with Charles as father and daughter more so than Logan, and the end wasn't as emotional as it could've been because of that](#spoiler).

And from that point on, it felt like the studio took enough risk and decided to play it safe. They stayed with the generic evil scientist villain and when Logan takes the serum to go beast mode, nothings happens that we haven't already seen already earlier in the film. He fights the same Wolverine clone and it's completely anti-climatic. I wanted to see Logan go out as a raging warrior.

To me it seemed out of character for the Stewart version of Charles because we always saw him when he had his shit together. But the implication was that his mind had regressed to this lesser state and that he was all messed up on drugs.

dej66p6,Actually they both needed the serum thingy to heal up after they fought one another.,5x7z96
dej6pyz,"I admit the way X-24 carked it didn't sit right with me initially either.

But your question is delving deep into the fictional science that governs Wolverine, mutant healing factors, and adamantium (three things that don't really exist).

I think the lore on adamantium on adamantium is, in its solid form, a draw when the force is equal. Neither Logan nor X-24 would be able to produce enough force to pierce either adamantium skeleton, and if they were able to produce that force they'd more likely separate their flesh from their bones and kill themselves in the process (or re-grow their original bones I guess).

You'd have to tear the heart out whole (protected by an adamantium ribcage, remember) to possibly prevent the healing factor from replacing the missing tissue.

But now you're thinking about how the healing factor actually works. Like, is it just REALLY fast healing (which means that decapitation or the removal of the heart in one piece would prevent healing), or is it some stem-cell fancy bullshit where the DNA just rewrites the missing piece from scratch? I favour the former for this X-Universe, but if it's the latter then chances are X-24 might wake up in the woods in a month with a new brain and a whole lot of missing memories (and Logan will be punching his way out from under some stones soon after a long nap).

But the science would suggest that the explosive adamantium-tipped round would have enough force to pierce the adamantium skull, and the destruction of a significant portion of the brain would be enough to kill him.

Of note is that the adamantium itself doesn't heal, so even if X-24 gets back up, he's going to have a massive vulnerable part on his head where it's just normal bone, which gives Logan the upper hand in any future fight (he just pierces that part of the skull with his adamantium claws and puts X-24 down for another month/repeat process forever).",5x7z96

The Omega and level 4-5 mutants (The X-Men) were the 7 inadvertent deaths that we heard along with 300?  injured just before Logan shut off the radio.

*3 yeah that was a bit silly

*4 it was already established that the kids didn't want to fight and really other than Laura didn't have much of a fighting instinct.

*5 yeah that family dying was pretty gut wrenching. I mean the guy was a Geriatric on meds, he probably wasn't making the best decisions but thought wolverine needed to experience family

deikkws,"1. He's a sadist. He's Wolverine in full berserker mode with no normal mode. Probably just to fuck with him. 
2. Adamantium can only be pierced with adamantium. So at this point, the bullet is just a normal bullet through through a normal person. If the bullet has enough propulsion, it can pierce through the brain, or blow it off. In Origins, it pierces slightly through his skull, but doesn't go deep in it. 
3. Logan's thing now is not to kill. He regrets killing the cholos at the beginning because he doesn't want to be a killer. The kids are still scared, and he tries to make them not kill, which is why they run away. Plus, they were outnumbered, I mean they all got caught. 
4. I don't know. He's senile and in his 90's, so who knows how he thinks? Also, his seizures don't freeze them, but slow them down to the point that they appear frozen.

deibvuw,"It wasn't perfect, but it was a very enjoyable blockbuster, and it had a solid and recurring theme. Both Logan and Laura were bred to be weapons, and struggle with being anything *but* weapons. Calliban struggles with his past as a not-so-great guy, the Professor struggles with the horrors of all the people he hurt and killed in his mistake at Westchester, and they all try to learn to live with it. 

I agree that the kids jarred from the tone of the film, but i think that they were still necessary, and weren't done badly. The film needed that spark of hope, that there were new mutants out there who were working toward a better future. Otherwise, everything Wolverine did for Laura would have lost some of its purpose, as he's no longer fighting for all mutants, but now just for his daughter. 

Wolverine's arc is to expand his view of family and the people that he lets into his life. He had Charles and Calliban, both of whom he kept at arms length because he didn't want to get too entangled with them. He's clearly lost friends and faith in the world. Laura works her way into his heart (and everyone's heart, I think) and he starts to care about her and, by extension, the people she cares about. 

But yeah, X-24 was weird and I didn't care for it. Made sense storywise, but the visual style wasn't great, and my mind instantly jumped to the Terminator remakes when he showed up. I'll give praise for these things, though:

- Didn't reveal it in the trailer
- Younger makeup/CGI was convincing (the beards really helped to distinguish them)
- they didn't overuse it. One fight to show that X-24 gives zero fucks, one fight to show he can kill Logan, one fight to use Chekov's Adamantium Bullet to kill Logan's past and prove that he's more than the weapon he started out as. ",5x7z96

denuojd,"I think you just totally misread the ending.

My favorite thing about the film is exactly what you say is lacking in Logan's ark (redemption, emotional resolution, justification for all of his suffering), and I'll explain how the film achieves these things in my eyes:

[For me it all comes back to the in-film comics. I didn't realize it at first, but I think the reason those are in the movie is mainly to show how much Logan hates this positive, idolizing representation of himself because he's never seen himself as a good or admirable person. And on the flip-side, it's there to show that Laura (who is a fan of the comics) does see him this way.](#spoiler)

[Now whether or not Logan ended up killing X-24, there's absolutely no denying that without him the mutant kids wouldn't have escaped, which leads me to my final point: By sacrificing himself and allowing them to escape, Logan finally did something that even he himself could perceive as noble and good, and *that's* when he can finally die. His entire ark of self-loathing and regret is resolved by allowing him to ensure (to the best of his ability) that the next generation of mutants can *themselves* lead normal lives.](#spoiler)

[One last thing, I think this whole perspective on his ark is really re-enforced when you consider what Laura did when she turned the cross on it's side so it's an X: It's her marking Logan's life as one that ultimately had purpose, given the way she sees the X-men (a term she would only have known about by reading the comics).](#spoiler)",5x7z96

As others have said X-23 is slow to pick up the gun and save Logan, which perfectly mirrors his inability to let her in and save him.",5x7z96

denwwqa,[deleted],5x7z96

diebypn,"I think you kinda missed an important point that the movie drives home. 

One of the reasons for Logan's depression are the burdens that come with being a ""hero"" - ""because in the real world people die.""

* It's why he feels guilty when Professor X accepts the families invitation to spend the night there and why he hikes out to repair the water station with the farm hand. Deep down he knows that staying there will make the family at serious risk for trouble but he does it anyway. Helping the family out with the water and the jerk ranchers is the least he can do.

* It's reinforced when Charles remembers the people he killed when he had the seizure years ago at the Academy meant to be a safe haven for mutants. He tried to do good and did, but good people still died.

* It's again mentioned when Logan is in the Ford Bronco and explicitly mentions how him trying to do the right thing has only brought pain and suffering to his friends. ""Hey, I never asked for this! Alright? *Charles* never asked for this, *Caliban* never asked for this! And they are six feet under the ground!"" (So yes, they are spoken of afterward.)

* Finally, the overriding theme is summed up in monolog from *Shane* that Laura quotes. Having the family survive would undermine this theme. There is no living with the killing - innocent or otherwise. It is a brand that sticks. Thats why this movie needed to be rated R and had to have violence that is grusome. It emphasizes that point.

The movie subverts the many tropes present in standard superhero movies (and westerns for that matter) by highlighting the grim reality that comes with being a hero -- whether a superhero or stranger-turned-sheriff -- people will die when the hero comes to town. Whether the people who die are innocent or evil this is not something that should be celebrated. (Logan tell's Laura this when he says ""All the same..."" after Laura points out the people he purposely killed were ""bad guys."") 

After spending much of the film deconstructing the trope of the arrival of the hero as an inherently virtuous thing, the movie reconstructs it by reminding the viewer that there still must be a hero. Despite the sad reality that the hero will need to endure sacrifice and people will end up hurt or dead, *someone* has to stand up to evil and *someone* has to be the hero. (For if the only thing needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.) It's why Logan abandons Laura to the Reavers at the start of the film only to rush in and save the children from the Reavers at the end. 

Once that evil is vanquished, once there are no more guns in the valley, and, in the movie, once the Reavers are dead and the mutant kids are safe, Logan no longer has to be the hero, and he finally understands what it feels like to be free of the burdens that come with being a hero. It's why his final words are meant to be multi-layered. 

First, he says to Laura ""Don't be what they made you."" definitely means don't be a rage filled weapon like X-24 but it also could be interpreted as Logan telling Laura not to be like him. He doesn't want his daughter to shoulder the burdens that come with being a hero.

Then, he says ""So this is what it feels like."" On one level he saying the obvious, ""So this is what it feels like... to die"" but beneath that it could also mean ""So this is what it feels like... to be free from the burdens of having to be a hero, to be loved again, and ultimately, to be happy and recognize why life is worth living.""",5x7z96
di2y7am,"I also felt the way Xavier died was a bit strange and in the end he didn't really end up adding to the story.    It's like Xavier being present was basically just to add to the background of there are no other mutants and they missed a chance to explore the Logan + Xavier relationship at a deeper level.

I enjoyed the movie I am just disappointed.    The movie was really marketed as exploring the trend of making darker and more adult superhero movies in the same vain that TDK did, but I felt that the outside of the darker cinematography the story line itself felt a bit flat and like they were selling us the same old story.


The actors all showed up, but the actual material they were working with just wasn't all that it COULD be, and with Hugh Jackman giving us his final performance as Wolverine I thought they could have really given him a more heartfelt and deeper goodbye.   The script felt like it was trying to be something grittier but ultimately was still shallow.

I don't want to see them reboot the X-men the way they do spiderman every 2 years and I couldn't imagine anyone playing wolverine after Hugh Jackman being the wolverine for the past 17 years.  

I do however, hope that they continue THIS timeline with Logans daughter in a standalone film next.    I would interested to see how they could continue to explore her story, intertwining her own past and that of Logans.   The aftermath of the events that took place here, the events in Westchester, the safezone across the border...they have a lot of material to work with and a lot of mutants she could come across that connect with Logan and her (Sabretooth pls).

But (and a big 'but'), it will deliver a whole lot more emotional payload if you watch the earlier movies.

Essentially, the movie is a culmination of Logan's long life, everything that he's done so far, everything he's done so far, and all the suffering he's gone though. Knowing his pain and loneliness accumulated over many human lifetimes, and knowing that everyone he's been really attached to have died horribly, lets a viewer understand why deep inside, he really, really wants it all to end.

Professor X killed 7 mutants (presumably core X-men) when he had likely his first seizure.

Contemporary Western[edit]
Also known as Neo-Westerns, these films have contemporary American settings, and they utilize Old West themes and motifs (a rebellious anti-hero, open plains and desert landscapes, and gunfights). For the most part, they still take place in the American West and reveal the progression of the Old West mentality into the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This subgenre often features Old West-type characters struggling with displacement in a ""civilized"" world that rejects their outdated brand of justice.  
  
Revenge story. The plot often involves an elaborate chase and pursuit by a wronged individual, but it may also include elements of the classic mystery story.

Having read her in comics for fifteen years, I really didn't like the changes to her origin story with the other kids. Laura is grown to be a cold, killing machine with no remorse until Logan teachers her different. Having a support system for her with the kids worked against her characterization and ruined her character arc potential with Logan. With X-24 as well, it just became too much. Too many clones and X-23 could've served the same purpose as well. Have her be a Winter Soldier-esque character who, like X-24, gets sent to capture Logan who is harboring Xavier.

degh286,"Logan is based loosely on the Old Man Logan series, with a dash of the Death of Wolverine, and X-23's origin story thrown in.  It takes place in an alternate future in which the Marvel universe villains band together to take out the heroes.  In Logan's case, Mysterio (a Spiderman villain) makes him think he's fighting a horde of X-Men foes, but he's actually slicing up his teammates.  After that, Logan wanders for a while, getting his revenge, and then eventually settles down and starts a family.  After the Secret Wars event, he's thrown back in time to the main timeline (616) and joins one of the X-Men teams.  

The main Wolverine, meanwhile, had founded his own school (the X-Men left the Xavier School some time before for the West Coast, Wolverine founded his school where the Xavier School had been).  I forget why, but some point after that, his healing factor stopped working.  This eventually led to Wolverine dying as he tracked down one of the Weapon X researchers.  He was killed by being *covered in molten adamantium*.  Laura takes up the Wolverine mantle.

So to answer your question, the X-men always have always been tied into time travel plots, so really, anything is possible.  Also, Logan probably should be viewed as a *possible* future, not a definite one, much like the comics.  More to the point though, this movie takes place significantly later than any of the other movies (save maybe the future segments in DoFP), so there's plenty of space to fill in.  Any further Wolverine roles won't be filled by Jackman, however.  The post-credits scene from Apocalypse supports that, or the introduction of a version of Dakken or another Laura, in the main movie timeline.",5x7z96

deixcdp,"I don't entirely agree but I appreciate the perspective. As a *superhero* movie I might call Logan a failure, too bleak, too grounded, and not enough genuine fun to be had. Never mind comics themselves have told plenty of bleak stories, that isn't really near the core of the concept which is more like All Star Superman or JLA/Avengers. Superhero movies are a different breed still but they thrive best on being fun popcorn movies where drama can and even should be present but isn't all you're getting. That's why Marvel's in house films succeed so often.

However yeah throw that out and treat Logan as a regular movie with a stand alone premise that happens to be ""near future western with light superpowers"" it is pretty damn masterful.

It's set 22 years in the future, and in the intervening period there have been no new mutant births. You don't discover why until the end -- it turns out Transigen's been spreading chemicals through the population to prevent the expression of mutant genes.

There are other mutants left, but not many. They're dying off, and no new ones are being born. Doesn't explain why there aren't lots of older ones left -- that's left to the watcher's imagination. Worth noting that only a minute number of mutants actually had visible characteristics or notable powers. Many of the older ones might be hiding their natures for fear of being seen as ""God's mistake"", as Logan put it.

The X-Men themselves were killed by Xavier a little while before the events of the film.

dezh9ix,"1. No, the adamantium wasn't affecting his healing factor. The virus that the bad scientist Zander Rice created was destroying his healing factor, and because of that, the adamantium was poisoning him. His healing factor was the only reason he could survive the adamantium injection process to begin with. With it crippled by the Transigen virus that wiped out most other mutants, his adamantium was finally killing him.

2. I'm not sure why you think none of the other films happened. Although even if this was some alternate reality, there's no reason some events didn't remain the same. But none of this is ever stated.

3. They're old and tired. They're clearly supposed to be exhausted, frustrated old men. Xavier has a degenerative mental disorder that apparently caused him to kill many of the other X-Men, btw-- they hint at it with his comment before the X-24 stabbed him as well as a radio broadcast immediately following the casino attack. Apparently Xavier's condition led to him killing a lot of the people he cared about, so maybe he's not exactly happy-go-lucky anymore. Remember that once upon a time he got shot in the spine and got pissed off at the entire world for a good number of years, and that wasn't even his fault. Logan has never been a stalwart, stand-up guy himself, either. How many times did he run off and abandon everybody at Xavier's mansion to go looking for himself? And the last time we saw him he was living alone in the woods with bears and trying to avoid all contact, so he's not exactly a family guy either.

4. Is it? You just said in [2] that none of the origin movies happened. We don't know what reality Logan is set in. The comic that it's based off, ""Old Man Logan"" was a one-off. Not to mention that even *if* this was following the DoFP timeline, we never see much of the new future after Wolverine wakes from the past. Sure, there are students, but how old are they? That was 2014. This was set in 2029, so he's suggesting that no new mutants were born starting in 2004. That means that there could very well be 11-year old mutants in DoFP, but none younger than that. Fact is, we don't know.

I'm not sure what you mean about Xavier being dead as a plot hole. He was very much alive at the end of DoFP, assuming that's the timeline we're going with, and if you're talking about the fact that Logan *said* he was dead, that was clearly a lie to try to keep people from hunting him. I don't know how Charles not having any hair and being paralyzed are plot holes. He's been bald and paralyzed for years.",5x7z96

I don't quite agree with everything you wrote but this, definitely. They are so laughably incompetent it felt really contrived to me, in most of the conflict sequences.

dez0ajz,"It sounds like most of your issues are with the X-men movie universe as a whole, something that this film cannot, and really isn't expected to, solve. Many of the plot hole issues (Timelines, powers, etc) stem from the other movies not being coordinated and this film having to pick up at some point of one of the messed up timeline. Try to view this movie as an alternate reality, where it is loosely connected to the other films but has its own history. 

As far as your issues with characterization, I think it's pretty important to remember that people have layers. Bad times bring out different parts of us, and our outward appearance doesn't determine who we are on the inside and how we feel. Xavier is still a hopeful, caring person. He's just frustrated that Logan has effectively given up and that he's pretty much trapped. Logan has had many ups and downs, and I don't know where the idea that ""Bravery and Loyalty"" being defining traits came from. Wolverine is often an anti-hero, and while he is ultimately a good person, he often exhibits very negative traits. He runs and hides from his problems, and has commitment issues. They show, however, that Logan is willing to lie to protect Laura and Gabriel. This leads to the conclusion that him trying to leave her may have been, in his mind, for her protection. After all, he tells her that everyone he cares about gets hurt. He probably thought that leaving her would best for everyone, since he doesn't want to get caught up in stuff anymore. Not to mention that X-23 proved that she can hold her own. Logan wants to help people, but doesn't trust himself to do it.",5x7z96

Erm, because it fits the storyline now (esp when Hugh wants out of the Wolverine character).

> how could it happen at all given his healing ability?

Healing power heals healing power?

2) Blame Fox for this. Disney/Marvel has its issues too, but the X-men movies are purely on Fox.

3) Bravery and loyalty, to someone whom he trusts. Charles is one of them. Which is why when X-24 took Laura away, he ran back to the house to check if Charles was alright. Laura was just a girl he knew barely a week ago. And he's not really his daughter per say, only someone whom he share genes with. Laura was born out of a mother's womb with Logan's DNA, not someone Logan had intercourse with. There is the a distinction between these two. And towards the end (final act), Logan probably trusted that Laura had more than enough to handle the rest of the soldiers, while he took on X-24.

edit - to add more to Charles' behaviour, I'm thinking they deliberately had him swear at Logan, swear at Caliban, and then turn around and told Logan to watch his language (in front of Laura when they were in the car, I believe).

That's why he kept asking Logan why he was there. He didn't understand it was to keep people safe from Charles.

As to the Adamantium? The plot isn't about curing Wolverine. They repeatedly state that something in Wolverine is killing him. Wolverine keeps brushing it off. Of course we understand he does this simply because he knows that the metal can't be removed.

I thought it was brilliant and it's even canon. The Fantastic Four in their stories had comics of themselves as well as other merchandise.

The comics are used for revenue, PR, excuses for their absence and to make screw-ups by the heroes into some villainous plot.

There may be a little bit of an inconsistency with First Class as the other poster mentioned that it only gives him amnesia in that movie, but I also don't remember the context of that encounter at all.

To me, that means that before she met him, she was under the impression that her father was the Wolverine, this great hero who always helps people and stands for justice. Can you imagine her disappointment in meeting this drunk, grizzled old man with contempt for everything? She probably was incredibly let down, culminating in that amazing moment where Logan tells her that everything he cares about goes to shit and she says, ""I should be fine then."" Logan is too proud and grizzled to admit this and just decides to let her go until he sees that Pierce and Rice are after her. Yet again it appears that he has fallen short of saving the people around him and he is forced to spring into action. Finally he becomes the man that Laura always thought he was. Then he fucking dies. Up until that climax, he wasn't her daddy, until he rose to the occasion and then he is ripped away from her.

[First of all, we already got that in Wolverine, it worked fairly well in that movie because in that timeline he killed Jean so that's why he kept hallucinating about her. And it could work in this movie as well, but I feel like it would be too distracting. Especially during a moment like his death.](#spoiler) 

[I thought his death was made very well. I loved the double meaning of the ""So this is what it feels like."" I think that's more powerful than what any flashback could do. So is Laura calling him ""Daddy"". A lot of this movie worked so well imo because it kept itself very grounded, very focused, almost simple. Instead of some ancient mutant shooting laser beams into the sky and murdering people by the millions, while screaming cliche villain lines, all because he is evil; Logan is is a very personal movie about... well Logan.](#spoiler)

[The death scene is very simple if you think about it, it's him dying while his daughter is holding his hand. But there is so much emotion behind it. You see him accept death, you see him finally embracing Laura as his daughter, you see him learning ""what life is about"". That's the emotions he was feeling, I think flashbacks would totally ruin that.](#spoiler)

[As for his nightmares. But you already said it, he is having a nightmare about brutally killing someone. We know that that's what he is dreaming about, so do we have to see it? Even before he straight up says it, we know enough about him that it's pretty clear what is going through his head. Flashback would be unnecessary in this aspect. And as for Jean, she doesn't get a single mention in the entire movie, him dreaming about her would be shifting the focus tto much.](#spoiler)

deg64bo,"I see where you're coming from on your points, but I disagree.  I think the transition from ""I don't care about you little girl,"" to Logan sacrificing himself was tempered sufficiently by his admission, ""I suck at this.  Everyone I care about ends up dying or getting hurt.""  That's basically him saying, ""My behavior has been a front.  I don't want to get close to you because our life as mutants, mine in particular, necessitates that there is pain.  Loss.  Hardship.  But it doesn't mean I'm completely devoid of emotion.""  I didn't see it so much as a quick transition from apathy to sacrifice in addition because of the scene where they showed him watching the drones/Reavers from the cabin window; he realized he had to act.  He couldn't just let the Reavers hunt the kids down like animals before they reached the border.  He didn't know unquestionably what he was doing would be a sacrifice, but he couldn't justs sit idle.

What I think the farmer family scenes established was a way to both reintegrate/give Charles and Logan one last glimpse at family living and present the idea of the three of them, ""Chuck,"" Logan and Laura, as a family unit.  As mutants who might seek the same thing these farmfolk have were they not being hunted down for the mere fact that they're mutants.  ""It's not too late for something like this,"" Charles suggests to Logan, with the hope that Laura, essentially his daughter, might finally be that crucial puzzle piece that Logan needs to find some happiness in his life.  The dinner scene is also highly sentimental; Charles and Logan reminisce briefly about their time at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.  They remember one last time.  They actually smile and laugh.  It's a much needed scene of poignancy and emotion, considering the rest of the film is so grim and violent.",5x7z96

It's a great adaption of Old Man Logan, it's probably the third best in the series but the hard on for it is going to be like that for a while and people are going to claim it perfect for a while.  The flaws will become apparent a couple of months later.  If it makes you feel better, my theory is that Cable is from this future and the events of this timeline prompt him to go back.  Thus possibly saving Xavier/Logan/Mom&Pop so as a what if storyline it works well.  As an ending to an entire series? It's kind of terrible.

They used modified corn (processed to corn sirup, used in stuff like softdrinks) to distribute some sort of ""vaccine"", possible also other every day products like shampoo or other stuff. They it in the movie to the eradication of polio with the invention of a vaccine against it.

>Was it as an indirect result of what professor X did? If so, maybe they should have elaborated that further. Where are the rest of the old mutants? 

Charles remembers his first seizure where he killed/hurt a lot of people. At one point in the film after the casino Logan is listening to the radio and the news compare the accident to one that happened in  Westchester where seven/several people where killed and over 600 injured. Westchester is where Xavier's School for Gifted Youngster is located, so it is implied that the professor killed at least part of the old X-men by accident. Also some where probably hunted down by Transigen (or similar corporations/military). It is mentioned that Caliban helped track mutants at some point in his live, like they use him in the movie to track Laura.

>What the fuck was that green stuff Logan injected into himself...it was like he already knew what it was... 

He didn't know what it is or what it does, but the children knew at least what it does. Transigen (the corporation that made the children) used it on them after fight training to make them regenerate faster and to make them stronger. One of the kids tells this to logan. We as viewer also see it used on clone Wolverine (X-24) to make him heal.

>Why is Canada now magically safe? What the fuck are those kids going to do while in Canada?

First of all i don't think we actually know it is. They have the hope that they will be save there and live (that's what they hope to do there). How much of this is imagination of children (they used the coordinates from a comic book as a meeting point) or actual reality is not sure. I read somewhere else here in this thread that said that the sanctuary is something run by mutants. Although i don't remember any hint in the movie about this, just because we are told there are no muntants anymore doesn't mean this is a fact. I mean Logan, the professor and Caliban where left alone because they where simply hiding and it was probably easier than hunt them down. Also that whole weapon X program was something that started from the US military and Transigen is probably an american company. In the US they were protected and in Mexico you can probably just pay authorities, that won't be as easy in Canada.

>Why aren't all the kids speaking broken English with a Spanish accent?

My guess: the whole research lab was located in mexico. The staff (like Gabriela) who take care of the children will speak mostly Spanish with them the researcher will speak English. So it would be save to assume that's why they speak both and Spanish better than English.

>Why was Logans kid the only one being hunted down?

She is X-23, which makes her a bit more special. They always had a special interest in Wolverines mutation, since the regeneration makes for a perfect soldier. They straight up cloned a mindless Logan for X-24.

>How the fuck did the other kids make it all the way to the Canadian border without the help of one of the only mutants left? 

Gabriela could pay Logan 30k, the kids also had probably quite a bit of money. You can assume they weren't quite hunted like Laura and therefore simply could pay some normal smuggler to help them.

>Why did it matter that these kids were hunt down if they already have the product they wanted?

Because what they did was highly illegal, you don't really want to have that running around. Also their product wasn't perfect either, so they probably still want to do research of them. They probably simply only have given up on them becoming the soldier they want.

>(The other Logan) So much didn't make sense, and didn't piece together, that it just frustrated me at the end. 

Can you elaborate that a bit more

To the end i personally really liked it. Logan wasn't so much about setting something else up, it was about giving mainly Logan and to some extent Charles Xavier a proper closure. And i think it succeeded in that regard. Now i still hope we will see more of Dafne Keen playing Laura, since she was phenomenal. But i think they can set that up in another movie.",5x7z96
delj4ek,"> Also, they say the X-gene is no longer naturally occurring, but how? How did they get it to stop....everywhere in the world?

They said it was Rice's doing. He discovered a way to wipe it out and put it in people's food/drinks. 

So technically, if this is true, there are some remote places on Earth would have been untouched by Rice's genocide attempt. Mutants were wiped out from the first world. But I guess it's just easier storytelling to say ""the whole world""",5x7z96
deli1t9,"Those were not just any corporate baddies at the farmhouse. It is later revealed that the gene-manipulated corn they grow and make into syrup is the reason that no mutants developed their powers. It was subtle gene therapy. Xavier killed most of the older mutants in his own school in his first seizure attack. 

It is not the government of Canada that is saving the kids. It is implied that it is a secret group of surviving mutants. The coordinates were of the meeting-point but the true Eden is beyond the border. 

The serum and many other details are part of the comic this was based on. What other explanation do you need beyond ""old weapon X drug"".

The kids are all different versions of the experiments they were running, Laura being X-26. So it is possible that they were all raised differently in terms of language contact. The later the models got, they reduced human contact to the point of reaching X-24, the Logan clone which cannot speak at all. Reducing language and emotional contact was part of raising a weapon ""without a soul"".

The kids were ALL being hunted, but they were divided. Not all of them made it. The ones that did were the strongest. Logan was only part of X-23's story. They had to find and euthanize the kids since they are living evidence of the crimes they committed.

>- Why did Logan and Xavier degenerate so much in this timeline as opposed to the Days of Future Past timeline? Sure, the events have changed but their biology is still the same. The explanation in this movie is that Logan's sick due to the adamantium, but obviously he also had adamantium in DoFP and it didn't affect him the same. There's no explanation for why Prof X's mind has gone so downhill.
>

So, as far as I can gather, the general idea of this timeline is the mutant gene was all but killed off. Xavier's deteriorated state appears as a brain disease. For Logan, his healing factor kept a significantly reduced state of his powers in tact, so he probably started aging due to the healing factor not being able to keep up anymore.

>- X-24 is killed by an adamantium bullet to the head, which essentially blows his brains out. Logan is shot in the head the same way at the end of the first Wolverine and his head is obviously still intact, he just loses his memory.
>

Uh... Plot device? I got nothing here..

>- Where are the rest of the X-men? AFAIK Prof X ages the same as everyone else, and he was already fairly old in (the future portion of) DoFP so all the other X-men should still be alive, right?
>

In the comics, this was called House of M and everyone lost their powers. If we kinda roll with that idea in this movie, then this future is a dystopian one where mutants lost their powers and either went into hiding, started normal lives, were captured, or killed.

>- The technology in Logan is mostly identical to ours today. DoFP had flying ships and very advanced robotics (sentinels).
>

Okay, so I think there are actually three whole timelines going on here. There's the timeline containing the first 3 X-Men movies, there's the new timeline created from Logan going back in DoFP, and there's a third, more contained timeline that was another spin off dystopian concept if the sentinels took over. 

This is just me trying to make an educated guess though.

Not a gun expert myself but Laura uses a revolver to shoot 24, and those should have more impact than a hi-caliber rifle or modern handgun (happy to be corrected). You could also argue that because the bullet didn't kill Logan, he learned his lesson and had a different type of bullet made to make sure it killed him this time.](#spoiler)

> Personally I don't like this explanation. It feels out of place for the regenerating abilities we have seen from Logan. He has been able to fully reguvenate as he is being burned, survived bullets to the head etc but his body cant stop a slow poisoning effect? It feels like a bit of leap.

Disagree. In this explanation, his body has been fighting the adamantium poisoning *constantly* for almost what 70 years at the time of Logan? Meanwhile he's been alive for ~200 years, not taking any semblance of care of himself... including drinking heavily and barely sleeping....

Add in the wounds and such he sustains during the movie (and before)... it makes sense to me that his rejuvination abilities simply were wearing down to the point that having a poisonous metal inside his body 24-7 started to become too much for his mutant powers to fight off.

Wolverine's ageing was greatly slowed by his mutant abilities... but never completely stopped. He still aged. Look at Professor X in the film... his source of power (his brain) also betrayed him in old age...

These mutants aren't Superman... they're mutated humans, and thus as with everything else, it stands to reason that their powers would diminish or fail with age.",5x7z96
deku9qy,"The adamantium is poisonous to the body. It requires a body with an incredible healing factor. Logan is nearly 200 years old, and his healing factor has been severely slowed, to the point that his body can only expel foreign substances not close the wounds.

this is by far the best explanation. Admantium may be a fictional metal that has basically indestructible physical properties, but idk if i have ever heard anything about its chemical properties.  More than likely it oxidizes/corrodes like any other metal; it may have taken 60+ years to start but its seems like that is what its doing and some sort of admantium oxide is leeching from the implants, and slowly poisoning him.

We can assume here that as he gets older, his healing factor isn't working as well. Keep in mind Wolvie is REALLY old. He ran with Captain America in World War 2 (pre-freezing). He still has his healing factor, but its not working as well (hence him not healing instantly from wounds anymore). At the end, he just took too much damage. ",5x7z96

Then nightmare scene comes along and he opens himself up a bit, even talking about how he was saving the bullet to blow his brains out.

Personally I think their bonding came from something more quiet and primal. Their similarities + cooperative struggle to survive allowed Laura to bond and grow to like Logan, which by the end allowed Logan to finally open up to someone.

I believe the movie changed it. My impression is that Xavier murdered the X-Men via his super powerful seizures. For starters, while in intense 
 pain Wolverine was always in control of his actions during the Professor's outbreak. So I doubt he'd go crazy. Likewise, Wolverine seems very protective of Xavier being reminded (or even remembering) what he had done, hence Logan making the radio be silenced. I figured the ""Logan what have you done"" line was probably based on Logan essentially keeping Xavier in a vegetative state where he no longer could help anybody, all while also turning his moral back to the world.

Everything up to the hotel scene was great for someone like him, but then stuff like carelessly putting a nice family at risk and then being killed off seconds after realizing what he did rather than getting a chance to redeem himself didn't do justice to the character in my opinion. But besides him, most of the rest of the film was solid.

That's the brilliant part of the movie though! In Logan, things has consequences. Charles doesn't get to redeem himself because that's how it works in comic books, not in reality. That's really what is perfect to me with this movie compared to every other super hero movie out there except for maybe The Dark Knight and Watchmen: Damning consequences. ",5x7z96
deicdxp,"Charles was senile and going a tad insane. The medication screwed with him, but at the end of the day, he was still a bit outside of his element. He couldn't control his powers, and he was selfish enough to want a nice meal and a warm bed rather than leaning against the window of a truck. It was a bad call, but it was an in-character bad call. 

The other thing to keep in mind is that he was a supporting character, not the star. His role is to drive character development, and while he has some, his development (or unresolved issues) are not the focus. 

Charles (through no meaningful fault of his own) hurt a lot of people and never had a chance to make it right. Logan makes it clear that he feels conflicted about all of the people he's hurt and killed, and he has that opportunity to make at least some of it right by getting Laura and the other mutants to safety. Charles's regrets are Logan's driving force.

In discussing her weirdness at the gas station, she had only recently been out in the open for the first time and had very little experience with it.

Marvel was only in the comic business at that point and their business was struggling. Sony similarly licensed rights to spider man. Marvel didn't get involved in making their own movies until the hulk (with Edward Norton) and Iron Man.

A condition of that licensing was that these studios retained the movie rights to these intellectual properties as long as they kept producing content. As long as Fox keeps pumping out movies, they keep everything involving mutants.

It's my understanding they even keep the term ""mutants"" which is why quicksilver and scarlet witch are never referred to as such.

I like to consider myself a movie snob.  I typically don't rush to rave over superhero films but Logan is a clear standout and imho, will mark a change in tone for the future and open doors previously unavailable to prior franchise efforts.

2. Because the black farmer's entirely family just died at the hands of a mutant. Heck maybe he was just racist towards mutants. His entire life was destroyed in the space of about 15 minutes. 

3. It's a clone, so it probably scanned as a mutant/human. Plus he's ancient, Alzheimer-riddled and drugged up. 

4. The harpoon would kill. Quite Sufficiently. The person that they harpooned had super healing powers like wolverine. Net guns don't work super well due to aerodynamics, tasers against moving targets isn't ideal.

5. Correct. 

6. They continue running towards the border. I don't recall anything about them having no fear. In fact I'm pretty sure the whole motivation behind their escape was they were still kids and basic human emotions couldn't be programmed out of them.

7. They killed everyone and they had *a few* mutants capable of digging a hole and filling it with rocks. They had access to comics and literature presumably, Most children would understand the meaning of a cross at a grave.

df15rbr,"> Also, it didn't feel like the future it was describing? Somehow it was apocalyptic and yet not at all?

There was no need to. They weren't trying to showcase the time period. It was no different than making a movie today and setting it in the past but they went forward. Some of the cars were different, there were different UIs for the dashboard and phones, many of the military people had robotics/ cybernetics. It was a setting they were not trying to turn it into a character like many scifi movies, which this isn't heavy scifi in the first place. It looks post apocalyptic because of the color palet and where it took place. Even in the future the mid-west is still the mid-west. They go from Mexico and an abandoned shack to a farm and wilderness. The casino is really the only urban environment they show at all in the movie. In those settings trying to shove the year would be intrusive. It was all about being subtle. Take those farming machines in the distance, they mention them but we never see more than that. If this was done with a tone more like X-3 or Apocalypse then we easily could have seen a fight seen on one of them.

Even as things progress into the future there are always places that won't look like it. They're not hard to find.",5x7z96
df1xdd6,"What didn't feel like Logan to you? My only critique was that the character of Logan seems to go through the same arc in every film, but it's a great arc for the character (lone wolf, doesn't care about people---> does care. But then clearly get's fucked over by it and goes back to not caring). I agree that it was a ""superhero"" movie second, if at all.    
I also really liked how they depicted the near-future. Slightly sleeker cars, self-driving freight, and giant corn harvesting machines seemed like the only real changes that were overt.      

Also, this film was, to me, about Logan to the extent that it didn't really need a strict ""villain."" It wasn't about Logan stopping some particular villain, is was about what made Logan, and what he has been struggling with ever since the Weapon X program. To get campy here for a second: he was his own worst enemy (sort of literally).
      
And lastly, just to share my opinion, I appreciated the action. Unlike some films [*cough MichaelBay/Zach*](#spoiler) where the actions gets dragged out and repeated, I felt that while there was a lot of slashing none of it became over played.    Curious to hear your thoughts.",5x7z96
df3fn69,"One thing I would ask you to consider when thinking about this movie in terms of it being apocalyptic is who experiencing the Apocalypse. In other words what does this movie look like from different characters points of view. Let's look at three different points of view in the movie, Logans, the family that took them in, and the doctor that tried to help logan.

From the point of view of the doctor that tried to help Logan the world hasn't changed very much. Obviously he lives in the same world where people are now taking more supplements to make them feel better as alluded to in the scene where they're walking through the cornfields. In this world ominous mega-corporations seem to also have taken over a large majority of things. We also know that he is aware that mutants have been dying out but this is just a fact that he knows not something that he's necessarily concerned with. So if this movie had been about that doctor then the tone of the movie wouldn't have been as apocalyptic as it would have been perhaps depressing at the lack of opportunities that he perceives available vs. when he was younger. He is more an outsider to the Direct effects of the changes of that world.

Next we can look at the family that took Logan and his crew in for the night. This too is a family living in the same world as Logan and the doctor but for them the realities of the change are a little more apparent. Because of what they do they have a slightly clearer View of what goes on behind the scenes. They also face some of the realities of not conforming to the new way of things. The whole interaction over the water is a clear indicator that the life they had before is being changed in a negative way due to the new circumstances of this world. They are likely aware of all of the same facts that the doctor is but the changes hit closer to home. The future for them is more uncertain and the possibilities they face in that future could be seen as closer to apocalyptic.

Then there's Logan. From Logan's point of view,he lives in a world in which he has fought for and sacrificed to improve, but which  has only ever gotten worse. The professor was always a shining Light Of Hope in that world has begun to succumb to it. and as far as we know just about everyone that Logan has ever known is dead. We are also aware, as is Logan, of how little of an effect his previous exploits have had in improving that world. From Logan's point of view the world is pressing down on all of them. Because despite the fact that Logan has always had a pessimistic View of the world he has always fought on the side of Hope and throughout this movie we see that hope diminish. The battle is no longer making the world safe for mutants as a whole, the battle has now turned to one of pure survival. And that, I would argue, is the epitome of living in an apocalyptic world.",5x7z96
df11iqp,You should read a comic. This film felt very much like some of the more recent Wolverine stuff. ,5x7z96

I found most of the emotional parts cringey as well. The parts where Laura calls Logan Daddy, the X-men comics and figures, the cross at the grave in the end.

dekp12w,"I was kind of getting the impression they went brutally gory as kind of a sub-theme of how screwed up real violence actually is. Wolverine straight up said, life isn't like the comics (movies), people die.

So, yea I think the violence was kind of shocking, and was numbing and made it hard to relate to the other emotional developments they were working on.

I don't know if it took away from the other elements of the movie though or was just a different message you could take away from it (particularly with the ""You can't come back from killing"" lines). They basically demonstrated that being shell shocked from violence can make it hard to relate to people.

I actually wasn't able to connect that well with the characters either but I'd like to see it again and see if I feel different the second time.",5x7z96

degl1ou,"So my problems with this post start with why it exists here in the first place? You are in the Official Discussion of the movie Logan forum, posting about how you are disappointed by 3 movies of which you have seen two, and then admit you haven't even seen the movie you are in the forum of? Something is wrong here. Anyone who expresses disappointment of a movie without actually seeing it while in the forum of that movie is either trolling or very confused.

Secondly, I recommend you see the film, it shows Wolverine in his true glory like he was always supposed to have been shown. I am not going to argue that the past films have neutered him in terms of the visceral brutality of his character, because they absolutely have, but they and he did the best they could with the rating they were given to work with. This movie finally shows how vicious Wolverine is, both young and old. How they do it, I won't tell you, but it is very well shown to us.

As for the rest of your points, Wolverine is an insanely hard character to write a convincing movie villain for. He can heal from a nuclear explosion, and his skeleton is indestructible. He is like Superman level cheap but without the weakness of kryptonite, so they have to find a way to make us fear for him and make a movie where he doesn't just quickly slice and dice through every bad guy he comes across. He needs to find something to overcome. Origins is awful, but The Wolverine was actually really good, and losing his claws made perfect sense if you know anything about adamantium.

But to address your main point, no, there hasn't been a solo movie at all with him in his prime because it would be boring as hell. He needs weakness otherwise every fight would be over in seconds.",5x7z96

demdwit,"> Like the movie lacked a proper setting. You just get kinda thrown in the situation where Logan and Dr.X are dying, with no explanation as to why they are, how that happened or how it is possible for Wolverine to be in the process of dying at all.

Personally I feel like this is the issue with a lot of modern movie audiences and films. You need everything explained for you, it's why movies like Batman vs Superman happen. Where we see Batman's parents die for the 8th time on the big screen. Logan had a long runtime as is and it didn't need anymore useless exposition to try and explain away a meaningless backstory. It makes no difference how they got there, what matters it the arc of the characters from the beginning of the film to the end.

Personally I found the way they told the ""backstory"" to be perfect. It wasn't contrived dialogue, it was the radio broadcast, the water issue, and when they did try to do the ridiculous villain exposition Logan just blew his head off almost immediately. Leave the rest up the imagination. 

The setting was some of the best I've seen in a comic film TBH. It was like a cyberpunk-western. As for your issues with the acting I'd say you're clearly in the minority. 

>What in particular made the movie enjoyable to you guys? Did you maybe perceive the things I listed in a whole 'nother context that puts them in the right place? In general, why did you like the movie? I'm genuinely interested in your opinion because this is the first time my opinion about a superhero movie heavily differs from the general consensus and I would be happy if I could rewatch it with your guys' point of view in mind, maybe so I can enjoy it myself then.

I mean just read through the reviews and this thread. Like I said earlier, you're in the minority. I'm sure more people would be interested in hearing about why you didn't like the film. Most people are saying it's one of the best comic book films of all time. I'd say it's up there with TDK(not R)*, Deadpool, and Batman Begins. 

As for your cringing at the end of the film. It's a movie about a guy running around with metal claws in his hands. Seriously going to get hung up on the cross at the end? They made it as serious as they could within the context of the comic book world.

demf49d,They told you specially why he was dying. The adamantium was poisoning him.  ,5x7z96
deme2ld,"I personally thought it was more powerful not really knowing how logan and professor X got into the situation that started the movie. 

It is hinted at throughout the movie, but you don't know for sure. [What happened to all the other x men? was it logan? was it charles? Who knows! and ultimately it doesn't really matter. Not spelling out exactly what happened felt more powerful to me. It seems like Charles might have killed everyone with the onset of his illness and logan was the only one able to survive it. Logan's mutant powers are also finally slowing down which means his adamantium is poisonous.](#spoiler)

I enjoyed the movie as it was grounded in everyday issues. Logan is taking care of his mentor who is suffering from end-of-life diseases all the while suffering from illnesses of his own. They weren't faced with a supreme villain's scheme or trying to save the day. [They were motivated at the hope of providing kids with a chance at peace, even if that peace was unknown. I think the connection between Logan and x23 could have been built up more though. x23](#spoiler)",5x7z96
demb1m8,"Re: your second point, about the emotional scenes.

For me, i thought they were great because of their complete attention to detail. For example, [when Charles is stabbed by X-24, and Logan comes back to the home and realizes it, he runs up the stairs and carries Charles down, all the while repeating ""It wasn't me."" That seems like a strange thing to say, even when a clone is right there, except that Logan has a history of going berserk and completely losing control. To him, it wouldn't have been a stretch if Charles DID think it was Logan that killed him, especially since they'd been arguing that day.](#spoiler) It was that small detail that really resonated, and personalized the scenes, because for the first time in almost any comic book movie, it felt like actual people were speaking these lines. There were other examples, but that's the biggest one that comes to mind.

The setting and acting that you mentioned, I just had the opposite reaction. I didn't care that there wasn't 'one specific place,' as much of the movie was spent on the road. And the acting, particularly from the main three characters, was more than fine to me throughout. I'm no expert though. Just watch a lot of movies.

I'm sorry you didn't like it as much as I did, but everybody has their preferences.",5x7z96
demc5kg,"To your first point, [I thought they sufficiently explained both Logan and Professor X dying as poisoning from the adamantium skeleton and a neurodegenerative disease respectively. No, they don't immediately address the situation, but by the middle of the movie it is explained for both of them.](#spoiler)  They didn't really go into long infodump expositions for either, and for that I appreciated the movie went with a more subtle method of relaying that information.  Another example of this approach being used is that there has been a mutant born in 25 years.  We don't get an explanation for the situation until almost the very end of the movie but the lack of new mutants is explained.

demcl3p,"Everyone's entitled to their opinion and I hate when people downvote genuine, well argued opinions, like you've done. 

I enjoy 'superhero' movies but purely as popcorn fodder usually, X-Men and Wolverine included. Logan blew me away. I knew it was going to be different going in - that it was going to be a more grounded, dark affair - but nothing could have prepared me for the brutal and raw emotions that the movie utilized so effectively. 

I'm not even usually an emotional movie goer. The only movies that ever really brought me close to the brink of tears were Schlinder's List and maybe Downfall. I'm not saying I was close to tears in Logan, but it was a sucker punch of a movie. 

I don't know, maybe it's more the radical departure from the norm that's so jarring - previously, we watched these characters on-screen as we munched popcorn, safe in the knowledge that ultimately, the good guys would inevitably win the day. 

To see Logan and Xavier in such pitiful, depressing states in Logan, to see them beyond rock bottom, at their most tired and vulnerable, with no hope to cling to, to see that everything that's happened since the first movie seventeen years ago was all for absolutely nothing and everyone they both loved is dead - it's just heart breaking. 

I respect that the movie didn't connect for you and it's a shame, because for me it's a Wolverine movie I always wanted (more than I even realised, until I saw Logan) and that it offered you no effective closure is a bummer. 

I saw it on Thursday and I'm still dealing with the feels thinking about it, wanting to re-watch the older movies but almost afraid to because knowing where their fate ultimately lies is like a suffocating blanket that clouds my enjoyment of what I once considered mindless, popcorn cinema! ",5x7z96
demgzk1,"I thought the final cross to X re-positioning was a little cringey.  But it was done by an 11 yo, who loves xmen comics- so it made sense she would do it that way. Her eulogy also was partly absurd, a random bit from a movie she watched in that hotel room, I think. But again its an 11 YO, who was sheltered. It fits together in the context of her character and the movie. 

The movie to me was a good example of ""Show and not tell"" in terms of how the characters are where they are. To me it really allowed me to focus on their emotions and became a very personal look at these damaged people.  I think the movie would have been far worse if there was a prelogue, or flashback sequences etc. to try to bring everyone up to speed. Its R-rated and meant for adults, who generally don't like being plot-explained to boredom. ",5x7z96
dembgl6,"> We felt like the movie lacked a proper setting. You just get kinda thrown in the situation where Logan and Dr.X are dying, with no explanation as to why they are, how that happened or how it is possible for Wolverine to be in the process of dying at all.

Movies often ""throw you in"" to a situation and explain it as the movie goes on. And we did receive explanations. 

> What I heart a lot about was how the movie was very ""emotional"" or ""emotionally straining"" and brought people to tears. Now, usually I'm a very emotional person myself and I enjoy movies that put emotions and relationships of whatever kind well in scene. But every scene in ""Logan"" that I guess was meant to be emotional felt really fucking cheesy to me, to the point that I was cringing really bad, for example at the scene where Laura turned the cross on Logan's grave sideways such that it was an ""X"".

Guess it wasn't your thing. 

> The acting wasn't that great, if not bad. Of course, Jackman and Stewart both deliverd solid, above average performances, but nowhere close to what they have shown they can perform in the past. And Laura was really hard to watch, sometimes I felt like I was watching a parody á la ""Superhero Movie"" when she was on screen, for example in the scene where Logan wakes up and she is standing on the rock waving.

She hiked ahead and was waving him over? Can we linger on this topic a bit? How is that like a parody? 

",5x7z96
dern9pc,"This is where I had to do some reading. If I get any of this wrong, someone feel free to correct me. 

1) The bad guy, assuming you mean the doctor, is Zander Rice. Years prior when Wolverine escaped the Weapon X facility, Zander's dad was killed by Logan. 

2) Hiding out they need a source of money. Pretty easy to follow. 

3) Remember from the earlier movies, specifically the 2nd one, when Xavier is kidnapped by Striker and is forced to concentrate very hard on mutants in an attempt to kill them while connected to Cerebro? He's a psychic. He had Alzheimers. When he has seizures he loses control over his power and can't keep that contained. Magneto also tries to get him to kill humans by rearranging the panels. 

4) X-24. Born of Logan's DNA, and focused to one particular emotion: rage. Supposed to be ""a perfect weapon"", though it appears he only obeyed the doctor. How many times have they now thought they can control a ""Weapon X?""

5) Donald Pierce. Part cyborg. Was not a direct blast and therefore did not kill him. In the comics he is a part of the team known as The Reavers. 

6) Not entirely sure, but it appears to be a chemical that forces the regeneration mutation to activate and allowed Logan to fight the poison temporarily, as his healing factor no longer allows him to heal from the adamantium. It was being rejected by his body by this point in his life. The Logan clone, X-24, it allowed him to heal as well. (Need more info if anyone would like to elaborate)

7) They hadn't yet? Not sure.

8) If you notice earlier on there is a scene with a bunch of soldiers lying on gurneys. I believe these are the same soldiers and are genetically altered to be stronger and faster. Also, think as if you're a kid. A big scary man is chasing you with a gun. You would run too being that outnumbered given you don't have the healing factor of Wolverine. 

9) I would assume hiding as I stated above. They are big scary men, and seriously outnumber the kids. Seeing him fight to his last breath must have encouraged them to take a stand as well. Laura also had grown attached to him, so if she was in danger or went to help him, her friends would also help. 

10) She's angry. She is Wolverine's genetic daughter. If you think of anytime Logan is pissed he also roars. It's basically them going berserk with rage and tapping into unhinged, primal anger and rage in order to increase their strength and speed.

11) Imagine again. You're a kid. Wanted by a top secret organization and chased down and hunted. This same organization has killed your friends and you've had to witness it. You wouldn't really trust someone at first glance. Logan earns her trust when he saves her from being kidnapped at the farm by X-24. 

12) The reason they were able to track them was Caliban, the albino mutant. He is able to track down individuals with mutagens and detect their presence. After he died, the reason they found Eden was the one soldier finding the photo with the coordinates on it. It is safe to assume that after the final battle, with the head of the company dead and most of his minions dispatched, that nobody else would know of their existence. They could be found again, but it wouldn't be so easy without a means to track them or a location in which to locate them.

Before his implant, Logan was shot in the head by execution squad and came out of it just fine. After his implant, getting shot in the head wiped his memory, and a long time later (during the times of Logan the movie), his healing's shit and needs the 'serum' to work.

From the comic she new Logan as some sort of idolized version of wolverine and as a young child that grew up with out parents it isn't too far fetched she was looking to find and meet him.

I think we also shouldn't underestimate how young she really is and the fact that she grew up in a very unfriendly environment (besides the mexican care personnel). 

So for me it is very plausible that she bonded relatively quickly and in the end he was also one of the only adults in her life that fought for her.

degjtqv,"Caliban killed himself and tried to take Pierce with him, but failed. Logan and Laura burry Charles by a pond. Logan wants to drive away, but the car doesn't start and he starts beating it up with the shovel he just buried Xavier with. It was pretty tragic, but somehow very comical at the same time. 

Laura steals a car from a fisher and takes Logan to a walk-in clinic (off-screen), where he wakes up. The doctor is intrigued to finally meet a mutant, but tells Logan that he needs to go to a hospital, as there is something inside him killing him. They get out and Laura finally says her first words, convincing Logan to bring her to the coordinates on the envelope. Pierce finds the picture of Laura with her friends, it has the coordinates on the back. 

On the way there Logan falls asleep at the wheel multiple times and in the end Laura drives for the last miles. When they arrive there is a hut up on a cliff where the children from the research center are hiding out. Logan gets out of the car, blacks out and they pull him up on a pulley with a litter. 

They inject him with the green serum and he heals, sleeping for two days. While he is asleep the children cut his beard giving him his classic look. The children plan on crossing the border at dawn. The night before that Laura and Logan talk, with Logan not wanting to come along, saying ""Everyone I care about gets killed"", Laura replies ""Well, then I should be fine"" and leaves.

At some point before this (I think when he was sleeping) Laura finds the Adamantium bullet and tells him Charles said he wanted to die and that she shouldn't let him. IIRC that was what started the discussion that lead to the exchange earlier.


When Logan wakes up he finds the Serum next to his bed with a note, telling him not to take it all at once. He hears drones passing by and runs up to a stationary binocular-thingy (used earlier to show the pass they need to cross). He sees the Reavers chasing the children.

He starts running, but soon is exhausted. He injects the whole dose of the serum and continues the chase. They start fighting, alot is happening, some children show off their skills but in the end all, except for Laura, get captured. The serum wears off and Laura and Logan are watching them from the woods. He grabs a revolver and tells Laura to free her friends. 

Logan comes out of hiding and they talk for a short moment. They think they are safe, but Logan pulls out the gun and shoots Zander and some other henchmen in the head. Laura starts freeing the children, more mutant skills and Pierce releases X-24. 

This should be where you woke up.

dehkwdu,"So, I'm not gonna say you are wrong about the movie (though I personally loved it) because a reaction is a reaction, good or bad. And maybe I'm seeing things that aren't there because I like the movie. 

That being said, a lot of what you complain about in this post was answered in the movie. (What follows is a really long post answering a bunch of the questions you posed in your comment. It got a little out of hand. I still fully support you in disliking this movie, but if it was just these plot inconsistencies that did it for you, and not the tone, theme, style, visuals, story, etc, maybe there is some value in a second look.)

* For instance, in the scene where Logan meets up with Pierce, Mr. Robo-hand isn't chasing after Prof. X. He's chasing after X-23. In fact, he tells Logan to his face that he knew about him hiding the professor. 

* Professor X's random explosions are explained as seizures, causing him to lose control of his psychic powers. (IMHO, it's actually a neat little call back, since it's clear that Prof X is using the same basic power he used to freeze the president and his staff in place at the end of X-2, and the whole airport at the end of The Wolverine.) The pills he takes are to stop the seizures and subdue his powers so that he can't hurt people. These things seem to be linked, and there is a running theme in the story of the mutant's gifts being their own downfall. 

* By the time this movie is supposed to take place, Logan is ~150 years old. Nobody knows him by James Howlett, and it hasn't been the name he was primarily known by in probably 50 or 60 years. It's shown that the X-Men's adventures were turned into comic books, and since Wolverine was known as Logan throughout the movies where those were supposed to have taken place, it seems like nobody in the outside world knows what his actual name is. 

* Weapon X isn't actually alive and well. The bad guys in this were a similar, privately funded project. I can't recall the name of the corporation, but they definitely weren't part of the Weapon X program, or even the larger Weapon Plus program (though the lead scientist guy was the son of one of the big Weapon X scientists). 

* Asking why the death of the group of people he'd come to view as family over the years seems to be a bit of a strange ask. It wasn't just ""some mutants"" that Xavier is implied to have killed. It's the X-Men. All of them, except Wolverine. One of the major themes of Wolverine's character arc over the entire series has been that you can find purpose and home in people. Logan had finally managed to find that, and then had it ripped away from him. That's gonna leave anybody in a bad mood, semi-immortal superbeing or not. In fact, it seems to have been worse for Logan since it seemed to confirm his worst fears.

* Crossing to Canada seems like a fool's errand for pretty much the first 2/3rds of the movie, maybe longer. But it's made pretty clear by the voice on the radio that the new mutants had been granted asylum in Canada. Now, things might be pretty different in this strange, run-down version of the world, but I doubt the U.S. is willing to go to war with Canada over a couple of stray kids. 

* At one point, Pierce calls Xavier ""America's most wanted octogenarian."" But it's also clear the Pierce and his Reavers don't work for the government (but instead this big multi-national corporation), so he seems willing to look the other way on a pair of old, dying relics out in the middle of nowhere, until they start getting in his way. As for why Logan drives across the border to work in the U.S.? I'm honestly pretty stumped there. 

* I'm not sure what you thought the various character's motivations were, but I found them to be fairly clear. Hell, at one point, Laura and Xavier explicitly tell Logan what his motivations are. He wants to die. But he's unwilling to leave Charles alone, he still cares about him more than anything, so he wants to take care of him. Charles is the only family that Logan has anymore, until Laura shows up.

* Mini-magneto actually wasn't a Magneto at all, he was Rictor (see, cause his name was Richter? Eh? Eh?), a character who can control the ground (or technically in the comics, seismic waves). I'll admit, I probably wouldn't have gotten that if I wasn't paying attention for easter-eggs. However, if you watch closely during the scene where he ""throws"" the truck, you can actually see a spire of dirt burst out of the ground and fling the truck. 

* For the world going down the shitter, everybody seems to care, but just nobody thinks they can do anything about it. Xavier still seems to think there is some good to be had there, but Logan is pretty adamant that they aren't able to help people any more. Everyone is so busy scraping by that they can't really focus on fixing the world. Logan seems actively bitter that there are no more mutants, while Xavier holds out hope and Caliban seems resigned just to survive. 

* Logan *does* let those kids run directly into the arms of some unknown people, but that seemed to be a big part of his arc. He's also ready to just leave a family stranded on the side of the road until Charles intervened. He convinced himself that he didn't care. And beyond going with them (which he might have done had he survived) what else could he do? Start up another school? ",5x7z96

While Logan itself is more about the story of a couple of people, the X Men franchise itself has always been allegorical: you have themes of LGBT rights, staying hidden vs coming out, institutional discrimination and whatnot. Any X-men discussion trying to cull politics is like trying to discuss Full Metal Jacket or The Hurt Locker without discussing ""war"" because ""it's controversial"".

The theme of a persecuted people seeking safe haven is older and existed long before Donald Trump existed. (Hell, I was thinking of Mad Max as I was watching this). America has always been such a safe haven, and in that sense I think Logan was about how much that timeline had decayed, to the point where they had to escape from it. Could it be a Donald reference? Maybe. Shooting was over in August 2016, and no one really expected him to win then. 

What I find funny is that every time a movie about authoritarianism comes out, it will be considered ""political"" and ""anti-Trump"", in the current climate.

The part with the water was important for a couple of reasons. One, it delayed X-24 from making off with X-23 and ending the movie. Second, it made it so that Logan wasn't in the house when X-24 showed up, and thus Charles was easy to kill.

detqvpb,"My mother had a form of dementia (Progressive Supranuclear Palsy) and this movie hit home during the Charles scenes. There were days when she could remember everything about me and days when she barely recognized me. I was really overweight growing up, but had lost it during her sickness. So, about once a week, she'd say I was ""too skinny"" to be her son. That line Charles said to Logan was honestly a little too hard for me to hear. I was also with her when she died and watching Laura tear up and say ""daddy"" at the end was also very powerful. 

I will admit that I'm not the biggest X-Men fan. Don't get me wrong, I have a ton of respect for it, but I guess I never got into it as a child and now there's so much out there, it's kinda hard to pick new things up. That being said, I thought this movie was fantastic and I intend on going back and watching all of the movies so I can fully appreciate this movie. 

I'm very glad I didn't miss this one. ",5x7z96
devju2a,"Yea, this was a tough scene to watch.

He's been alive mentally for *247 years*, physically for *197 years*. Given all of the incredible shit he went through, no wonder his mind was a *complete wreck* after all that!

This is just a completely personal theory, but maybe the anti-mutant-breeding additives in the food happen to suppress existing mutant powers to a limited extent? If they do, that could have pushed him over the edge.

What sucks is that if he could get rid of the adamantium completely (hasn't happened in the films but happened in the comics), he'd be fine physically for a while longer once his healing factor was no longer fighting the adamantium. Also, if he had access to the serum that was used to accelerate X-24's healing along with cautious use of whatever drug the kids introduced him to that accelerated his healing factor, he could probably do extremely well for quite a while longer. Mentally he'd still be a wreck, but he could live longer, be in much better shape, and not even have to loose the adamantium...but he'd be dependent on some rather unique medicine to stay alive, and he probably wouldn't want that, especially since he had already given up.

What sucks even more is that Laura (X-23) and anyone else with adamantium in them is fated to die a very nasty death from adamantium poisoning due to a overwhelmed/failing healing factor (to be fair, after a long life) in the absence of a method to remove the adamantium, or access to enough of the serum+drug to compensate for the healing factor failing... And I guess Laura is never growing any further, because adamantium bones aren't going to grow, are they?

degel9p,"In DoFP after Logan fixed the timeline, Kitty Pryde no longer existed in the future to be sending his consciousness back, so for Logan's brain it was kind of like pulling a usb stick out of a computer mid-transfer and his brain got 'corrupted', causing memory loss. 

Then Jean Grey released Weapon-X in ~~1973~~ the 1980s and we can assume that his path was almost the same as from the original timeline. He lived his life with no memory of the events of DoFP, or anything before it. His memories start from when Jean ""found a piece of his past and gave it back to him."" Professor X knows, as do some of the Brotherhood of mutants, but no one tells Wolverine beyond little hints like ""Alkali Lake"". 

One day in the bright future of 2023 Logan wakes up *remembering* ~~everything all at once~~ only the dark future. He remembers living a life from the mid-1800s (he's like 12 at the start of The Wolverine in 1845) to the dark future of 2023 (that's about 190 years), ~~getting sent back in time, and reliving the last 50 years into the bright future~~. So he's got ~~240~~ 190 years of memories by my count. 

At least, that's how I understand it. I had to write this out a couple of times over 15 minutes to get my own head around it! 

Edit: as a few people pointed out, by the end of DoFP he doesn't remember *any* of the last 50 years starting from when he drowned in 1973. This is evidenced by him not knowing he's a history teacher and being shocked to see Jean and Scott alive.  ",5x7z96

One example of theater fuckery, though: [spoiler text here](#spoiler) As Logan attempts to eulogize Xavier, in his way, the people sitting next to me received a dessert they had ordered, which prompted them to talk about it to one another, smacking their fingers of whatever dessert residue they had accumulated as they started eating it, and so on. After their interaction ended, they both tuned back into the film--Logan is now smashing up his car in a fit of rage. They both loudly chortled and saw it as a bit of comedy.

There are two allusions to the event. Once on the radio in the car, where the the incident in the hotel is being discussed. They compare it to a previous event in Westchester that killed many people, including seven X-men. Logan turns the radio off. 

The second is just before Charles is murdered. He's just recalled the event, and that he killed all those people.

As he said bad things happen to people logan care about. So far it is completely true. All the chacters logan interacted with has met their end within the span of the movie.

That he feels loved and loves someone back.

Coming from a parent of a young child, l took as this and made me think of my kid (which I one day want to enjoy this movie with my kid).  It also why I started to watch my health, exercise and generally take better care of myself.

But, in lieu of having an ""inspired by"" soundtrack for Logan, it fits very, very well, especially since it ends with Cash's cover of [""We'll Meet Again""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KodNFsP6r88), which fits very well since we all know that while Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart won't play these characters any more, we'll meet Wolverine and Professor X again.",5x7z96

We'd either have less X-men movies or less of the other movies about smaller characters or both if Disney had the rights. Plus, I can't imagine Disney ever making an R-rated X-men spinoff so say goodbye to Deadpool. ",5x7z96

I would be okay with a reboot after the 90s xmen series movie. I also would be okay with forging ahead. They have some of the best comic book movies (xmen, x2, first class, dofp, logan, deadpool). They arent cookie cutter even if the details are inconsistent and timelines odd.

MCU can't give X-Men the time and risk Fox can. ",5x7z96

Didn't Zander say that they inserted some kind of vaccine in the food? I might have misundestood here but I assumed that it not only prevented the birth of new mutants, but also partially affected the existing mutants which could be the reason for the death of most mutants. Logan gets his regenerating factor reduced, so the adamantium poisoning becomes too much for his organism to deal with; Xavier develops a neural sickness (don't remember what they called it) perhaps because his brain can't keep up anymore with his powers (instead of the opposite: gets sick->can't control his powers any more).

Also regarding the x-men, they were together with Xavier when he had his first seizure and got killed by it (at least some of them; the rest might have died for the same reason as the other mutants).",5x7z96
degx2pj,"Keep in mind that Days of Future Past could have easily been preceded by two other X-Men movies.

dekbh3i,"This is true, however when people state something they often imply the inverse as well.

For example:

This is a nice jacket, it keeps me warm.

Logically, a 'not nice jacket' may keep me warm as well, as it doesn't logically follow that a not nice jacket doesn't. But we can infer by context that the person is implicitly stating that a not nice jacket wouldn't keep them warm.

So when Logan says ""Bad shit happens to people I care about"" it can be inferred that be believes ""Bad shit doesn't happen to people I don't care about"", otherwise he has no point in saying anything at all - ""Bad shit happens to people that I do or do not care about"" - ""here go shoot yourself"".",5x7z96

* The male protagonist is a miserable, jaded survivor who has lost sight of any hope in the world

* A wounded woman tries to get the male protagonist to escort a girl with a mutation (who she raised) to a safe zone because the woman wasn't able to; the male protagonist initially refuses because it's too risky

* The male protagonist's friend constantly urges him to take on the girl

* The male protagonist's friend eventually gets killed as a result of the escort mission they picked up

* The male protagonist tries to resist getting attached to the girl because of his past; they eventually get attached anyway

* Meets a black family who helps them halfway through the story, but they all end up dead (really stretching with this one)

* The girl isn't an useless follower but actually contributes in taking out the people hunting them; she uses stealth, mounting, and copious amounts of stabbing to get the job done

* The male protagonist eventually becomes incapacitated, and the girl ends up taking care of them both. She gives him medication to help him recover.

* The male protagonist tries to leave the girl with a group of people, because he already fulfilled his duty taking her that far; the girl confronts this by bringing up the male protagonist's past

* After recovering from his wounds, the male protagonist pursues and unleashes hell on the girl's hunters, because he didn't want her captured and/or killed

I'm not knocking the MCU and we all know Fox's track record with Marvel movies is spotty at best, but that doesn't change the fact that this was--to me--one of the finest ""films"" I've seen in a long time, and easily one of the greatest movies based on a comic book property. 

Credit to Fox for getting out of their own way and letting Mangold make the movie he and Jackman wanted.

When I watched it again and saw them shooting at the back of the Limo getting away, I saw her very quickly push Charles' upper body forward and her get in between him and the backseat.

Main issue for me is how Snyder crammed so much into it. Who needs that Knightmare BS, JL set up, DOOMSDAY, WONDER WOMAN.

A much better movie could have been made where it took more time to really develop the Batman vs Superman storyline, and them as individuals. Think about it - actually giving us time with Batman as Batman, maybe showing us some of his villains.. along with showing us Superman actually being Supermany. And have them have a much bigger scale fight.

All in all though, it was honestly interesting, and I liked the way it was all handled.

But generally that's what I don't like about the CBM's they do today - so much cramming and set up!

The reason I think Wolverine had a hand in it is because when he is talking to Laura about her (and his) nightmares he says that his nightmares are different than hers (where she is killing bad people) which implies that his nightmares are a reliving of him killing good people, maybe even his friends.

df9sz14,"I thought this was brilliant actually; sad and heart breaking, but brilliant.

You have to consider the characters.

Charles was always the visionary. He wanted to see the best in everyone. Once he became aware of Laura he was back to being the Professor, as much as he was able to. He took on the role of grandfather and tried to provide Laura with the support she needed. At the same time he was trying to groom Logan. He wanted Logan to step up to a paternal role and carry on the dream. Hence why Charles insisted they stay at the farm house. Charles was trying to make it a learning experience. He was trying to change him.

Logan has convinced himself he is damaged goods. Everyone he cares about dies. Love interest, dead. Good friends, dead. He sees himself as a kind of opposite of midas touch. Everyone he touches, dies.

The farm house scene only cements Logan's fears. Anything he cares about will die. So he rejects Charles attempts to get him to change and he rejects Laura completely in a perverted logic to protect her.

They saved her, both in her mind while captive, and literally once she escaped.  What greater honor could her give someone than considering them an X-Man?

On top of that though, the cross HAD to be an X for Logan himself.  They were his family.  Charles found him at his lowest and gave him a home.  That's why all of his roads ended up leading him back to them.  Logan might not have accepted that fully until the end, but it was true the whole time.  ",5x7z96
dfi8uqb,"And once again, this is entirely distanced from Old Man Logan, or what I perceived was the general inspiration that was somewhat taken and also completely distanced from in the movie, which is also probably online but I tried to ignore everything for this. So I guess if they want to take that character into the future they will require all new squad a la X Force or this will be another one off.

So you damage their brain?  Charles is still in charge.  Even though it's being retconned out, Charles was able to move his consciousness into a body that was otherwise braindead at the end of X3.  So maybe having a fully functioning brain does not limit the abilities of Charles Xavier.

Another possibility is that while Charles froze people in place when he had his seizures, he only affected the part of their brains that controlled their body, notably the brain stem.  Remember that Caliban was able to remember that he couldn't breathe in the first seizure in the movie?  People remember what was going on, so their entire brain isn't disabled, just this portion.

When Logan killed them, if he didn't destroy that part of the brain, which is still keeping them locked into their last position, it would make sense that until Charles released them or until that portion of the brain dies, they will hold that position.

Mangold compared Logan to sort of like a one-off comics, like a specific story, not tied by constraints having to do with world-building; I like that, granted, it only hits so hard because you've known Logan & Professor X for decades, but it really has that standalone flavor. 

I don't like to imagine a rebooted Wolverine, Hugh just owns that role, it's his flesh & blood, they very well could just leave it be, and somehow convince Hugh to come back in a couple of years, but they need it to be worth it narratively speaking, what more can you do with his character?

",5x7z96
dei11k5,"I should have clarified that yes, in this film, it's explained why, I'm just saying, technically, he should really be invulnerable. It's when writers need him to die or get really hurt, they bend the rules like with every superhero. 

But yeah, plenty of ways you can bring him back, I know all too well Hugh said this is the last time, I also know all too well that saying, he might just change his mind in a few years, like Stewart implied he would were he to be paired with Deadpool. 

I think at this point, they should just really part with the timeline concept, and just be able to do whatever they want like on Logan. World-building is cool, but like Mangold said, it really limits you in what you can do. ",5x7z96

Literally the whole fate of the corporation hinges on stopping these kids at the border. They failed to catch Laura and kill Logan on multiple occasions. They even tried to kill Laura in the first encounter outside of Prof x's tank. Instead of just killing them all at the end, so close to the border (which was clearly called out by the bad guys at the end again to illustrate how important it was), calling it a win, and moving on with their experiments, they try to capture them for some reason and not only failing, but all DYING in the process.",5x7z96

Obvious plot spoilers

[Initially, I saw the premise of his character ""Prof X has Alzheimer's"" as novel, the comic relief grandpa to Jackman's gritty nihilism. I even found the part after they escape the casino where he's in a daze, apologizing to people cute and funny. But it all changed when he was unknowingly talking to X24 and he confessed that he had the most amazing night but at the same time did not deserve it. He was shaken by the acknowledgment of the fact that he was no longer in control of his faculties. The longer I thought about his character, the more it stuck with me. In their universe, he was legitimately a superpower that could shape the world in whatever way he wanted. He could transfer his consciousness from body to body and live forever if he so pleased. He seemed to be just as immortal and lasting as Wolverine. But here he is in the bed, a fragile old man, confronting his morality. He doesn't get to die in a blaze of glory, fighting some villain, sacrificing for the greater good. Patrick Stewart made me see that Prof X was as human as any of us, he made me feel the pit of fear, guilt, and uncertainty that someone losing control of his body has, he showed me what it is like to die not a loud and glorious death, but the slow and quiet one.](#spoiler)",5x7z96

dekeeyb,"Yeah, u probably missed a few things",5x7z96
dekh0vw,"Since you mentioned life, human condition and political messaging for the Dark Knight (which is in my top 3 comicbook movies of all time), ill start with those :)

Life - ""this is what life looks like....you should take a moment, feel it"". In a nutshell, this film is saying the meaning of life is about love, family, a home. Logan's been missing that for years, which is why he feels suicidal. His journey with depression and dealing with horrible things from his past, is something that a lot of us can relate to, and shows us that there's always the chance to come back, if we only have the courage to let people in and help us. That no matter how bad it might seem, we still have time.

Human condition - growth, conflict, morality. One of the biggest themes in Logan is the conflict and morality of killing. Logan's nightmares, unlike x23's, is not about people hurting him, but Logan hurting people. Killing has much to do with Logan's depression. He simply cannot live with the killing, which is why the movie ""Shane"" is used so perfectly in this film. Previous superhero movies have no problem wiping out entire cities and murdering innocent people without taking the time to discuss the morality of it. Logan is a film outlining the consequences of not only killing (which is hard for a lot of us to relate to...i hope), but other misdeeds. That all the guilt and pain can cause you to end end up like Logan, destroying your life and your humanity. 

Political Messaging - i don't know if you missed the entire last act of the film, where there is a minority in the United States of America, in this case mutant children, who are being hunted by corporations, so they decide to flee to another country for safety (Canada), by crossing the border.....sound familiar?

Now i'm not saying that Logan is better than the Dark Knight, but it's so much more than just ""every other marvel movie"". Being ""the Dark Knight of the X-men universe"" isn't necessarily saying it's better than it, just that it is the gritty, dark, emotional, grounded and the best film of the series. ",5x7z96

dehsf5u,"1) Xavier doesn't know about X-24. He triggered flashbacks because Xavier is going down memory lane. X-24 looks like Logan and that is it.

2) Well the most powerful we've seen him(albeit enhanced) was in X2 when he with cerebral could kill EVERYONE on the planet. This is just the first time we've seen how out of control he could accidentally get. Really shows you how powerless he musty have felt against the future Sentinels. 

4) Charles and Logan do understand each other, but they are old dying men and heavily stressed in the film. Given his final words in death I think Charles understood.

5)  Charles seizures almost did put down OML. Yeah X-24 would have a better time but barely.

Charles is just mentally ill. There was no setup. Simply a bad combo. ",5x7z96

Just as a 20 year old can brush off an injury that would lay a 40 year old out for a week, Logan's healing factor would also diminish as he ages. He can still heal, but it's a much bigger strain on his body to do so. It's slower, less efficient and weaker. ",5x7z96

The adamantium bullet from *X-Men Origins: Wolverine* was ridiculous in that the only difference between firing it at Logan's head and a regular bullet would be the former zinging off in a ricochet with no pancaking like a lead bullet would have. You'd need a LOT more velocity than a gun can provide to pierce one piece of nigh-indestructible metal with another.",5x7z96

That was the end of that timeline.

The new timeline which branched off 1973 when Mystique sparred Trask, is the timeline where Apocalypse happened in the 1980s.

- I disliked how kids kill that one guy and then behind them Logan is getting killed..  I was thinking ""what happened to all the kids?""  Are they just standing there watching?  I'd rather have seen some frantic attempts to help him, even if unsuccessful because the two guys are like on top of eachother with claws in eachother.

- Logan is basically dead, but how do they know for sure he's dead...  they know he had bottle of stuff to help him heal, they know all these bad guys showed up in trucks and any of them could potentially have more of the blue stuf to help Logan heel.

I get in the context of the movie it might be wrong but when you take a gander at all the movies or just the timeline in general it makes no sense that Adamantium poisoning would be capable of single handedly destroying wolverines healing factor when hes withstood insane amounts of damage at once multiple times. Especially since wolverines healing factor has never weakened throughout the other movies or even parts of the timeline when he was exposed to his adamantium skeleton. Its only constantly strengthened due to the massive amount of trauma he takes on average.

Look what happened to the motorcycle when he sat on it. His skeleton is mostly isolated from the rest of his body. Which means how does his bodyproduce bone marrow, muscle/tendon adhesion? Remember before Logan got his upgrade he only had to heal when hurt, now with the new skeleton, his body has worked 24/7 since then to keep him from dying. Which i believe was a constant strain on his powers and eventually his mutant gene was exhausted from constantly healing him from the strains of having a foreign metal in his body. In a comic issue (i forget which one) when his adamantium skeleton is removed his healing factor was pretty much instantaneous.  Well, thats the way i think of it.

But then...if you really think about it, the setting, and the no-mutants context was pretty superficial. I don't know why people are giving it a free pass on not adequately explaining its pivotal backstory. If you use such a colossal contrivance as fuel for your story, you have to pay for it. The movie wants to be a drama when it feels like it, and a cliched Hollywood superhero movie when it feels like it, and then be praised as more than the sum of those parts. 

There were moments when we saw something new about Logan, and moments when there was some authentic/earned emotion. At the beginning of the movie, we see a few scenes of Logan working as a quiet, depressed limo driver. *That's* the side of Logan we haven't seen, that challenges us an audience, to believe this grizzled indestructible raging beast is capable of acclimating back into society, that the world broke him, that he turned into one of us, not a hero or antihero, just a normie. Those scenes made me uncomfortable. Seeing Logan as a driver while obnoxious college kids chanted ""USA!"" That's a more complex moment than seeing Logan physically weak. But the will-he-won't-he be the good guy seemed to be Logan's entire character this movie. Immediately we see Logan is still a hero, taking care of Xavier in his own way. Then he saves the day. Then he saves the day again at the casino. Then he saves the day again at the farmhouse. Then he saves the day again in the climax. His whole character was reluctant hero, just the same as we've always seen, in Wolverine, and in so many Hollywood movies. Yet the movie pretended it was profound and unpredictable since he was *so* reluctant all the time. 

I'm not saying I didn't like this movie. I thought it was above average. Xavier's character was definitely taken in a completely new and complex direction. Hugh Jackman's acting/the make-up/filters all came together to make the Wolverine look grizzled in a really cool way. But c'mon folks, think a little deeper about why you like a movie. If you still like it, then great. When you see the green bottle of super-juice (ex machina) with a note on it that says not to take it all at once, and you think, *hell yeah! Logan is most definitely going to take that all at once and just go total beast mode! Ohh it's going to be so awesome!* and then that happens, does it mean it's really so great? Maybe. That might mean it's a great fun action superhero movie. But you have to work harder than that to transcend the genre. ",5x7z96

depfbns,"There are things they could have done with an R rating, but the Nolan trilogy is still my favorite....and what's terminally underrated is Michael Caine's performance in all three movies.

Not judging you if you like those more, but personally I think the more serious drama focused on the characters really took the film to the next level. I loved the dystopian part, seeing a hero broken and defeated, and it hit all the right notes.

It was most likely adamantium poisoning.  But Logan isn't a scientist or doctor, so he's not going to get over-technical about it, is he?

It was most likely an Xavier seizure that killed the X-Men, but it also could have been a version of the comic explanation or a combination.  Xavier's mental health issue triggered Logan to kill everyone.  We'll never know, because Xavier was confessing to X-24, not Logan.

It was implied that Logan always planning to abandon Calaban eventually when he got his boat, so we know he's not particularly attached to him.

deo7owi,"I think they confused it with Carbonadium, which in the comics CAN harm Wolverine.

They've gone back and forth over the years on can adamantium stuff hurt wolverine?

dei34xr,"1.) It's not necessarily that they sucked at killing - it's that they sucked at doing so indiscriminately. The project lead told Caliban that they didn't posses the rage and amorality that he hoped they could incite from youth - hence why they pivoted to the adult cloning program that yielded X-24. 

Which, I also just realized, the actual corporation still exists and still has the requisite DNA and equipment to create more clones of Logan, so there's that. 

2.) That still doesn't explain the careless way that he endangered that family. Logan protested, and seemingly in control of most of his faculties, Professor X told him to shut up and deal.

3.) Fair enough, but it goes to show that after 150+ years Logan still hasn't learned a thing lol.",5x7z96
dei2uq8,"Which is completely valid, don't get me wrong - and in my first point I also conceded that it may be a bit more realistic that children may be too frightened to fight back...but there's a huge difference in the sort of rage and aggression Transigen hoped (and ultimately failed) to foster in the children in order to make them killing machines to be used against unknown entities, and self-preservation instincts that are inherent in all peoples.

dehyt0m,"Yeah, but it also made the point that they were good fighters.  We saw Laura's skills quite a bit, and in their training video we saw them using their skills against training dummies.  They weren't terrible soldiers because they sucked at fighting; they were terrible soldiers because they didn't follow orders and had emotional problems.

Like I doubt a tiger would be a very good soldier since it would probably just maul your own people, but if I were to attack it, it would certainly fight back.",5x7z96
delt31n,">  Maybe Wolverine goes off with the kids and starts a new X-Men instead of dying. I don't know.

I really don't think it was that bleak of an ending. And I think the movie would have been made worse off by having old man logan going off with the band of kids.",5x7z96
dem81nl,"I think Logan going with the kids would be lamer. But I agree that the villains and their plot was pretty weak. So they're chasing a mutant kid who regenerates like Wolverine, and they just shoot at them? With regular guns, which basically do nothing? Why not bring shock weapons, nets, poisoned darts or whatever? Also the deaths felt anticlimatic indeed. Still a good movie, but not one I feel like rewatching",5x7z96
dem912x,I think they went low key with the villains on purpose to leave the focus on the main three.,5x7z96
dely86y,"There *is* a swelling of hope at the end. That was the point. All the way through the film there was this tug-of-war between Charles' unreasonable hope and Logan's bitter pessimism. And then at the end, when he knows he's dying, he finally realizes that there *is* hope. That the children are the hope, and the hope is that they don't have to let fighting define them the way he did. It's the hope of an old man. Not a hope to survive, a hope that the next generation will be better. Personally I thought it was a very optimistic movie given its subject matter, just as much so as Gladiator and Saving Private Ryan were.",5x7z96

dem0bzk,"> But really, how fucking lame is it that of all the great villains Fox has access to under the X-Men license, it was a fucking Wolverine clone that kills Wolverine and Charles Xavier?

This right here was my biggest problem with the movie.

And I kinda agree about the bleakness thing as well.  I think my problem is that it pretty much rendered all the other movies in the series pointless.  Everything they've done (including going back in time) to try to save mutant-kind...and it's dying out anyway because of GMO crops?  Are you fucking kidding me?!",5x7z96

They are both pretty subdued characters played by arguably polar opposite actors. 

Laura doesn't have as much to say in the first half of the film and she's introduced early on in action sequences. So we get this hardcore view of her right of the bat which really pins her down for us even after we start to warm to her its already established that she's quite violent and uncontrollable, like a wild pup, and this will always be the case. 

Eleven is fragile as fuck but as the show goes on we want to see her 'get better' and see her using her powers to do so. They both have different journeys but both start out as fucked up abandon youths who don't communicate with others until bonds are formed.

To some extent, I can see how X-24 may bear some resemblance to a generic third-act villain but I think the parallels between him and the real Wolverine make him worthwhile. Plus, his surprise introduction was a great twist, and it's not like they just threw him in there for the final battle.

Additionally, I also liked how the evil doctor mirrored Xavier, and this character also justifies X-24's existence (he'd been trying to weaponize mutants and so far this was his best solution).

I think you're being unfair with the grounded universe of Logan. Much of the action before X-24 had been introduced was very heightened (motorcyclists getting tossed around on the chain link fence, Logan using one of the Reavers' vehicles to take the blow from the oncoming train), and you seriously didn't enjoy X-24 going ape shit on those rednecks?

The bigger question from him getting shot in Origins is whether he's had some Achilles heel type weakness in his head for 7 years. The bullet went into his brain, and then presumably his brain attempted to heal itself but ran into complications because of the bullet still being in there.

Basically the movies most influential to this are:

The Wolverine > Days of Future Past > Logan


He gets confronted by Xavier and Eric in an airport after his time in Japan. They recruit his help in fighting Bolivar Trask which leads to all of the events in DoFP. The ending of DoFP Logan wakes up in the school in present day (early 2010's) and sees all of the original mutants still alive and well, including Jean and Scott. This movie is assumed to have picked up after Logan went back to life at the school until Xavier caused the destruction of the school, leading to this post life where Logan is Xavier's caretaker.

I still think it's a drawback to the film because other films have portrayed violence in a similar light but executed much better (particularly the Revenant recently). 

In this context, it actually reminds me of Unforgiven. They both feature grizzled former killers who don't want to be defined by their past, but ultimately have to re-embrace the brutality of their youth. Hell, Morgan Freeman's character in Unforgiven is even named Logan.",5x7z96

because it came in a myriad of quick cuts and poor lighting and clacking of claws and shaky cam. I understand the director wants it to look raw and savage, but look at how the Russos did Winter Soldier. The sound mixing, the crisp takes, the framing,    the fight choreography were all so well executed and made the Winter Soldier seem just as powerful and rage filled, if not more so, than X-24.

I just find the concept of Wolverine's claws so intriguing and open to all sorts of innovative fighting styles that seeing the same basic pummelling (which was contextually very emotionally heavy, don't get me wrong) just left me disappointed.

",5x7z96
dej2wia,"I guess I'm on the opposite side of you, both in opinion of this movie and knowledge of the xmen universe. I have only see the other wolverine movies and a couple of the main series films. So, I pretty much went into this viewing it as a standalone film with a couple characters I knew. From that standpoint, the movie excelled at portraying parent-child relationships, with Logan very briefly trying to be that Charles, father-like figure to Laura. Taking her in, trying to prepare her for the life ahead since he has experienced it. The ending was perfect in my opinion because Logan (literally and figuratively) died to his own hands, something he had wanted for a long time. I don't agree the ending was sad or depressing. His death is exactly what he wanted and he saved all those mutant kids. I understand the character people are so attached to is dead, but Hugh Jackman would been done either way, so a proper send off for the character was so much better in my opinion. This film might not please xmen fans in the way they are used to/expecting, but I can't believe this isn't the best Marvel film to date. Actually, the reason I liked Civil War from the MCU was because they scratched the surface of real drama in a comic book movie that Logan really dove into.

I enjoyed the film and FOX has learned so much (slowly) over the years on how to create a world for the X-Men. BUT what they have not learned is to create a story that is a story that isn't based on the powers of the characters within the story. 

They had slots that they needed to fill and filled them with characters and when those characters didn't fit what it was they needed they altered the character to fit it. Like Caliban. He's not that weak in the comics. They had to alter it to make him fit. 

Onlsaught was a combo of Professor X and Magneto's meanness. An unrestrained not merged with Magneto Professor X should be tolerable. 

Wolverine's healing factor was dying but he was able to handle it far better than X-23 and her rapid healing. That's the story or it's based on his training. I'm saying that someone like Cyclops would be able to withstand a similar attack as well. His mind was far more adept to fighting off mental attacks due to his connection with Jean and most any female telepath. That's why Onslaught had a hard time fighting the X-Men as a whole.

2. When old Charles and young Charles were talking to each other in DOFP, older Charles was able to transfer a lot of his memories into his younger self in sort of the same way he was able to transfer his mind into his twin in X-3 (dumbest plot element ever, by the way).

Maybe the US have restricted/banned communication so most people don't even know of the mutants int he other countries.",5x7z96
deg3wi1,"Disagree with you very strongly there. Xavier's near the end of his life. He's breaking down mentally and physically, and he's unknowingly killed those closest to him. An inglorious death in a farmhouse is a sad twist on his character, but it played very well into the theme of mortality and loss that the film was pushing.

But the death had another narrative purpose too: protecting Xavier was all that Logan had left to live for. He's basically self-destructing while he waits for the professor to die. Xavier's death forces Logan to look to the future. His moment of truth comes when he sees the children being pursued across the border. He makes his choice, and gives all that he is, all that he has left, to rescue Laura and her friends.

I thought Xavier's death made perfect sense in the narrative. It wasn't a fate he deserved, but the movie itself had very little to do with what people deserved.

Your idea about the different caliber is good, and I am definitely inclined to believe that Logan improved the type of bullet to kill himself better.

Those two events take place before *Days of Future Past* when the timeline changed, rendering the events of X1 - X3 having never happened (at least to everyone except Logan).

The Adamantium bullet to Wolverine's head happened in the 80s, so that definitely would have been erased.

No reason for the rules that were set up to work differently, though. No reasons other than the fact that the plot demanded so, of course.

The reason it didn't bother me, though, is that they didn't break the logic of the universe willy nilly. They took the time to set up that these rules will not apply to this movie, and that an Adamantium bullet *would* kill Wolverine, regardless of what happened in any other movie.

The way you saw things it´s perfectly fine and now that you provided me with that logic i can also see things that way which further proves that maybe if it was another movie it wouldn´t have bothered me as much and my criticism is due to my attachment with the character, which kind of blinded my analysis of that scene. 
I can rest my OCD now stop being bothered with that massive detail =)
It was still a very good time and a very solid movie tho. Let´s hope Hugh was trolling us all when he said he wouldn´t the role anymore and appears in Deadpool 3 maybe? Perhaps Fox will show him what is called the Robert Downey Jr money to convince him lol  That would be the most amazing thing ever. ",5x7z96

deg8avi,"Apocalypse was weird in that regard. It seems to me it should have been a good movie, but fell victim to executives and committees in the early writing stages. You can just tell they approached the script with a checklist of items the studio wanted in there:

* Apocalypse and his four horsemen  
* Stryker capturing the mutants, the Weapon X program, and Wolverine.  
* Jean Grey/Phoenix  
* Magneto's family and evil => good arc.
* New generation of X-men 
* Quicksilver scene  

With the exception of Quicksilver, most of those points would warrant movies entirely to themselves. But Apocalypse had BvS-style schizophrenia, where the movie itself became a sacrificial lamb to establish the greater franchise. 

Weirdly, I think this makes me more confident for Fox's future outings. The blinding success of Deadpool, and now the big Logan sales everyone's predicting, are the result of studio non-intervention and a narrow cinematic focus. The talent's still there at Fox: Apocalypse only suffered because of questionable decision-making at the top.

Hopefully Fox learns its lesson and carves out its niche as a more experimental superhero studio, with a reduced focus on movies by committee. Keep attracting passionate people and giving them wide latitude to realise their visions.",5x7z96
degb8wh,Oh definitely not this film. This one was completely gritty. Would have been out of place unless it was tattered ones but it would be an Easter egg at best for him to have it around.  Yeah and that inevitable recast will be tough to swallow for me as Hugh is my wolvie,5x7z96

1. Why is Logan dying?  Logan is dying because the adamantium has slowly been poisoning him for about 60 years. He has cancer.

2. Why does Xavier have a brain disease?  Because... sometimes people get diseases. The seizures a side affect. 

3. About the antagonist and why there are no more mutants.   That scientist that Logan blew away with a pistol created a gene (or something along those lines) that wiped out the mutants. After they made sure that no natural born mutants were occurring they began abducting and impregnating women with mutant genes they have collected. They then harvested the children and were raising them to become weapons. 

4. Why is Logan so suicidal? Literally all he had left was Xavier. He just planned on offing himself after Xavier passed. Everyone he knew has died. Just like he said to Laura ""I'm bad at this shit. Everyone I care about dies"". Prime example, the innocent family that took Logan, Laura, and Xavier in for a nice meal and warm bed.  Or another example, the elderly couple that took him in in X-Men Origins.

-Adamantium poisoning

>In more detail, Why does Professor X have brain diseases and seizures?(I understand he was old and his brain was the most used muscle in his body, but still would have liked some closure)

>I would have liked to see more on the antagonist side of things and more about Logan, like why he was going by his original name

-He's always gone by ""Logan"" in the films; ""Wolverine"" was really just his code name with the X-Men, which seems to have been disbanded.

>why there are no more mutants?

I can definitely see where you're coming from and totally agree that ""Logan"" is way better and more mature than the other ""Wolverine"" movies (I hope I interpreted that correctly). 

The darker and less...hmm, how do I say this...less hopeful (?) atmosphere ""Logan"" is seeking to create is definitely the strong selling point here in comparison to, say, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", however to me it felt like they were trying really hard to achieve that atmosphere, but got lost on the way there. Also, I guess having seen Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" trilogy, which employs the same atmosphere and does so perfectly (in my opinion), makes it really hard to appreciate the same kind of setting when its realization is not quite up there.

As a film, Logan is wonderful. As an X-Men spin-off, I wish we could have had some more closure outside of, ""oh and by the way, everyone else is dead and there are no more mutants because GMOs yadda yadda"". It would have been nice to see Apocalypse in the new timeline instead of the First Class timeline, being fought by the original x-men, and that film concluding with the presumption that the X-men will continue to fight the badguys. And then Logan should take place way further into the future, in a world that didn't need the x-mem anymore because there was relative peace. And THEN you can say, sometime in the past, prof. X started having seizures and then killed the x-men.

As far as strengths of the film go, the chemistry between Xavier, Logan, Caliban, and X-23 was incredible. The 1st half was the definitely the strongest part of the film, and I found the first hour and a half to be the most compelling hour and a half of any movie that I have ever seen.",5x7z96

>The villian was entirely important

The villain was a complete nobody. 

He was NOT a good villain. 

Good villains = Magua from The Last of the Mohicans, Vader/Emperor, Mads Mikkaelsen in Doctor Strange, Negan from Walking Dead

This weirdo who we literally have NO IDEA who he is even??? 

That's NOT how you write a villain character.

>X-24 was the weakest part of the film (and least subtle metaphor in X-men cinema history).

No he wasn't!

He was literally the ONLY single (keyword here is actually SINGLE) person that was any threat to Wolverine. 

Everyone else was just cannon fodder and generic henchman. 

And the 2 fight scenes we have with him aren't exciting at all...there are MUCH better fight scenes out there. 

>Not a whole lot of action... You did watch Logan right?

A lot of action = Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, even fucking IP fucking MAN, Rogue One, John Wick, Avengers

This movie was not one of them.

I did not feel the same feelings of complete satisfaction after Logan. It was just a meh feeling. This is in comparison to the other films of the series though. I thoroughly enjoyed Logan, but it just didn't feel like the others. I would put 'The wolverine' in the same category as well. Neither really added anything to the series as a whole.

dehv4yz,"First of all, thank you for taking the time to respond, i appreciate it.

> By the time this movie is supposed to take place, Logan is ~150 years old. Nobody knows him by James Howlett, and it hasn't been the name he was primarily known by in probably 50 or 60 years. It's shown that the X-Men's adventures were turned into comic books, and since Wolverine was known as Logan throughout the movies where those were supposed to have taken place, it seems like nobody in the outside world knows what his actual name is.

I don't think the people that hunt Prof X care about age, as soon as his name is in any Database as known alias it would be a big target on his back to still use it. So either Logan never used it before (which means they could only get his real name from his brother) or he is extremely careless.

> Weapon X isn't actually alive and well. The bad guys in this were a similar, privately funded project. I can't recall the name of the corporation, but they definitely weren't part of the Weapon X program, or even the larger Weapon Plus program (though the lead scientist guy was the son of one of the big Weapon X scientists).

Isn't the clone called X-24 in the movie? I don't remember. Either way, the company is still around and they have more people working on genetics (see last scene with Caliban). There is nothing stopping them from creating another Clone or any other new Weapon.

> Asking why the death of the group of people he'd come to view as family over the years seems to be a bit of a strange ask. It wasn't just ""some mutants"" that Xavier is implied to have killed. It's the X-Men. All of them, except Wolverine. One of the major themes of Wolverine's character arc over the entire series has been that you can find purpose and home in people. Logan had finally managed to find that, and then had it ripped away from him. That's gonna leave anybody in a bad mood, semi-immortal superbeing or not. In fact, it seems to have been worse for Logan since it seemed to confirm his worst fears.

It is a big difference if Logan killed them or if he was just present while Prof X killed them. Also according to the movie ""only"" 7 mutants died, who where they, what happend to the rest? 

> At one point, Pierce calls Xavier ""America's most wanted octogenarian."" But it's also clear the Pierce and his Reavers don't work for the government (but instead this big multi-national corporation), so he seems willing to look the other way on a pair of old, dying relics out in the middle of nowhere, until they start getting in his way. As for why Logan drives across the border to work in the U.S.? I'm honestly pretty stumped there.

Lets say you are hiding americas most wanted and someone tries to blackmail you with that information? Would you continue to go to work or run as fast as you can? Logan has at least ~40k in cash, as indicated by the call to the boat seller. (And why he would buy instead if steal, no idea)

> I'm not sure what you thought the various character's motivations were, but I found them to be fairly clear. Hell, at one point, Laura and Xavier explicitly tell Logan what his motivations are. He wants to die. But he's unwilling to leave Charles alone, he still cares about him more than anything, so he wants to take care of him. Charles is the only family that Logan has anymore, until Laura shows up.

Yes, he said he did think about it. But now he could have a real family. It's not like X-23 is safer without him around, he knows they are chasing her, not him.

> Mini-magneto actually wasn't a Magneto at all, he was Rictor (see, cause his name was Richter? Eh? Eh?), a character who can control the ground (or technically in the comics, seismic waves). I'll admit, I probably wouldn't have gotten that if I wasn't paying attention for easter-eggs. However, if you watch closely during the scene where he ""throws"" the truck, you can actually see a spire of dirt burst out of the ground and fling the truck.

Yeah, but even then he could have helped more. The entire group of mutants seemed really weak compared to X-23, who we see kick ass the whole movie.

> For the world going down the shitter, everybody seems to care, but just nobody thinks they can do anything about it. Xavier still seems to think there is some good to be had there, but Logan is pretty adamant that they aren't able to help people any more. Everyone is so busy scraping by that they can't really focus on fixing the world. Logan seems actively bitter that there are no more mutants, while Xavier holds out hope and Caliban seems resigned just to survive.

And not even trying is why i think this movie is a bad x-men and a bad superhero movie. Heros are heros because they improve the world, even if they are antiheros like deadpool. This movie is just bleak and depressing.

> Logan does let those kids run directly into the arms of some unknown people, but that seemed to be a big part of his arc. He's also ready to just leave a family stranded on the side of the road until Charles intervened. He convinced himself that he didn't care. And beyond going with them (which he might have done had he survived) what else could he do? Start up another school? 

He could settle down, have a family. Just like Professor X suggested. Also sitting on the side of the road is kinda different than potentially running into a death trap. The scene with the family is less important anyway, because at that point Logan didn't know they could/would be tracked down so fast.

-----

Funny sidenote now that i think about it. People say The last Crusade would have turned out the same if Indy wasn't involved (which isn't true). But in this movie we see that the other kids could escape just fine without Logan, it is his involvement that even leads the bad guys to them. Not that it is Logans fault, more Gabrielas / whoever set her on Logans tracks.",5x7z96

Ledger's performance as the Joker elevates that film in every way and when you mention the Dark Knight the first thing anyone thinks about is the Joker. Not Batman, not even the plot itself, just the amazingly acted version of the Joker.

This was brilliantly acted all round and there's no one character this movie depends on like TDK relied on the Joker (which I'm sure was no one's intention but at the end of the day Heath stole the show and his death soon after added some mystique to that movie). 

Did Logan have a plot with several layers/sub plots like TDK? Nope, it was a fairly straight forward but well executed movie. I still love TDK but it's not as great as most make it out to be. The Joker is phenomenal, the rest of the movie is alright.

* Logan's relationship with Laura doesn't really feel like it developed properly and left me wondering why exactly she had much more grief for him than for Xavier who had been talking to her for who knows how long.

",5x7z96
detxcb8,"Well it's clear that while the Mexican/American governments have been heavily involved in the whole Transgien business, so in one sense the idea of the kids crossing the border is a huge deal because it puts them beyond the (somewhat legal) reach of the American reaver forces. And the US invading Canada to kill mutant kids who were created and treated as science experiments and weapons, in a way that horrifically violated every human rights law in existence? That is one hell of an incentive to stop the kids from crossing the border without crossing it in the process. It may be an incentive to illegally cross the border to chase the kids as well, but only to the extent that they feel they can legally get away with. Catching any of the kids via illegal crossing guarantees that any surviving kids who crossed will get extensive exposure as a side effect of the major international incident you just caused, while not chasing any kids past the border lessens the risk of as-extensive exposure since there's no major international incident involved. The kids talk via radio with someone on the other side. If that transmission was intercepted (quite likely), than the reavers knew that someone on the Canadian side was almost certainly watching in some capacity, so risking an armed and highly illegal crossing for this purpose would be an *extremely* bad idea *especially* given the lack of knowledge on *who* was watching.

I mean let's look at the evil deeds. He put mutants on the brink of extinction...by widespread insertion of an essentially harmless (in theory) chemical into the food supply, backed by government resources. This is likely an international conspiracy with a lot of different governments involved to different capacities given its scope of effects. It's not really something that anyone knows about, because they've very deliberately avoided putting any attention on it.

He cloned kids in Mexico (and much worse)...which is a violation that he's trying to cover up to the maximal extent possible here. There comes a point where a tradeoff has to be made between the risk of greater exposure (invading Canada to kill the kids means that if even a single kid escapes, you're utterly fucked when the publicity is focused on that kid's story) and the risk of letting the kids get away (ideally kill them on the US side and silence them forever, but it's not a complete disaster if they get across as they'll likely lie low, avoid drawing attention, and their stories won't be forced into a very bright spotlight like they would if they were the reason the US *invaded Canada*).

He sent a killer into a family home...on US territory, where he has the backing of the government behind him to cover things up. And it's not as if he killed particularly memorable people either - the fallout will be minimal.

He (and his reavers, and literal Mexican police if I'm remembering the movie correctly) did various other illegal deeds...on US and Mexican territory, where again they have the backing of the government behind them.

I mean make no mistake, he's a royal bag of shit, but he's a smart royal bag of shit, and he knows crossing the border isn't worth it unless they're absolutely guaranteed to get away with it (which they are not with unknown persons watching) AND kill every one of the kids in the process (which they are also not guaranteed). Any tiny flaw in the execution of this will kill them. Heck, even a simple video feed of his troops killing kids next to or across the border would utterly destroy diplomatic relations between the two countries. We don't know the political situation in 2029 and if there's sanctuary for mutants in Canada the government is likely aware of that and would not approve of kids getting killed, and it's far worse if they know the backstory. There is already a notable gap today between Canadian and American social policies. How wide would that gap grow in a world with mutants, where Canada may be one of the few remaining countries with a significant mutant population? What would it look like?

Remember, while Rice has the support of several world governments, support only extends so far. Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't they already bitching at him in one scene for at least X-24's murder spree, and possibly the casino incident (among other things)? The US government will support and tolerate only so much. Unlike in Mexico, Rice doesn't appear to have direct support from government troops, he has a somewhat-shaky relationship with them, and really all they're doing is various mutant-related coverups (for reasons that could easily benefit the US government) and giving him permission to operate freely within US borders to hunt down mutants (again benefiting the government). They also are complicit/involved to some extent in the whole mutant-extermination thing and very likely Transigen - the former is a minor involvement that furthers US interests, and the latter is a major involvement that they'd want covered up as well as possible to avoid the massive issues that would arrive if the program's atrocities were brought to light (hence why they still tolerate covering up for the reavers and allowing them to operate on US land). But if the reavers illegally cross the Canadian border to murder kids and at least one survives, or even just footage/observations from the Canadian side survives, then the backlash would be *massive*, and it would be incredibly stupid for the US to go to war against Canada (or to refuse to back down) - their best bet would be to appease them, because at that point you've not only potentially started a war with Canada, you've also very likely alienated many of your allies, and we don't know what countries would side with Canada due to the US's deeds or simple outrage over the US sending armed troops over the border to murder kids. If major countries (China, India, Russia, South Korea, certain middle eastern countries, various European countries, etc) side with Canada (it could even just be a single large country like India) for any reason, including taking advantage of the situation to settle a pre-existing grudge with the US -- again we don't know what the situation looks like in 2029 -- and war subsequently breaks out, the US is rather *fucked*. If countries just throw their weight behind Canada than war could be deterred quite effectively and the US could be in a rather tough spot, especially if a kid escaped to tell the whole story.

My point is, crossing the border is immensely stupid. Sure, the US military can kick Canada's ass in a one-on-one fight, but why would the US government sanction that? Better to avoid war, especially once you consider the huge issues that come into play when Canada has any kind of dirt on the kid killings or Transigen (which practically guarantee other countries getting involved). I can certainly guarantee that Rice knew the US would never tolerate an illegal border crossing by the simple fact that he was so insistent that they do not cross the border.

And you have to remember, an illegal border crossing by armed troops doesn't trigger immediate war. Canada isn't going to send their troops to invade the US - they'll start a shitshow in the international political arena before any military action (which is unlikely) would occur. If the US did absolutely nothing to appease Canada, then maybe war would break out, but as I said, there would likely be allies involved that would make this a very bad situation for the US and could even trigger WWIII under the right conditions.

I liked this movie quite a lot and I think they did a good job overall with the political factors. The only real sticking point (at least in a closely related topic, there were plenty of other sticking points in other topics) was that I don't think it's all that realistic to eradicate mutants worldwide using a foodborne chemical in the way it was described. I suppose that if I assume they were literal in their comparison to immunizations than that would make the task easier, but it still requires a huge amount of cooperation in a large number of governments (and major corporations). Getting rid of mutants is a goal certain elements in many governments may be fond of, even if other elements are not, so I guess it can be done, but it still stretches the bounds of credibility for me. I can see them being successful in large chunks of the world, but not to the extent that the entire world's population has been immunized. They would need to spread it via a highly-contagious viral vector to see such a high level of coverage, and even then there are a few remaining holes in the plot.

Even right now, as I type this, I can't really recall any obvious digital face-mapping, or body swapping. Like, with the Young Arnold appearances in Terminator, it's pretty obvious. The audience is asked to buy it because we are supposed to. But this was obviously different, because they had the actor there who could physically portray both versions in-camera. Even knowing that, though, doesn't take away from how truly mind-blowing those fight scenes were! 

In fact, I can't really think of a comparable cinematic example to this that so effectively pulled off an epic battle where an actor fights himself so believably. To pull this off, the pre-production, shooting, and post-production teams all had to be completely on the same page, with no deviations from that original goal.

deg859x,">I was hoping for a more epic fight between Logan and his clone instead of Logan getting his ass beaten completely twice but I understand the entire point of the movie was too show that these were the last days of Logan's life 

This takes place in (if memory serves correct) sometime near or a little after 2030 in the movie. Logan is like late 40's or mid 50's. 

The movie isn't per say about Logans last days as wolverine. Its the story of the wolverine preparing reluctantly for one final mission.

Logan's healing factor was slowed massively. They never really explained why. Beyond hinting to the triggers of old man logan. (so people who haven't read the graphic novel or comic is basically completely in the dark about why logan is suddenly so fucking weak)

The clone is literally logan in his prime. 50 year old man dying of Adamantium poisoning and being slowed down immensely by his own adamantium skeleton doesn't have shit on a clone that was bred to be able to carry the weight of a adamantium skeleton + lift a truck. 

Logan got chucked around like he was a pebble and logan's limp is clearly a result of his deteriorating strength. (notice how after taking the enhancement drug that limp completely vanished until it wore off then the feeling of pain and weight came back and suddenly his limp was 5x as bad as before)

That being said Logan's normally a savage but somewhat smart bugger. You'd think after running into laura he would start slashing instead of stabbing like crazy. ",5x7z96

On the radio after Charles's seizure at the hotel, the newscaster says that this is similar but not as bad as an earlier incident in which hundreds were injured and several died. 

In the moments before he dies, Charles tells (who he thinks is) Logan that he finally remembers what happened. Charles remembers what *he* did all those years ago, and he understands why Logan kept it from him.

Nobody says it out right, but the picture painted is that Charles' seizure killed his family. He murdered his loved ones though he had no control over it. His deteriorating brain became a danger to every one around him. Logan was so forceful with the seizure medication so that it wouldn't happen again. He didn't tell Charles what he'd done because he doesn't want to bring that pain back to him needlessly, but he now has to protect not only Charles (the man who saved him but was also responsible for the deaths of everyone Logan loved), but also everyone near him from the possibility that it would happen again.",5x7z96

To be honest, most superhero movies don't care about Oscar nominations because they're going to maximize box office revenue during summer/dead times like February.

degohh7,"I think this is the first time I've EVER seen someone say this, and it's kinda relieving. I've been wanting to admit this for a while.

X3 definitely was a mess of a story, but it wasn't ""bad"" in the sense that it was full of bad acting or embarrassing moments or anything. Like, you can't really *make fun of* anything in that movie (besides maybe the Golden gate bridge sequence, but I thought that was pretty fun). It felt just like a comic book ""event"" that revolves around a battle royale. The real problem was that it lacked a narrative focus and rushed too many moments into such a short time frame. But that doesn't necessarily make it frustrating to watch or less entertaining. 

I honestly like it more than Age of Ultron. Like, they're both ""empty spectacle"" movies, but X3 has the decency not to drag it out for two and a half hours, and has way more unexpected/risky moments. And I know a lot of people have problems with the comic inaccuracies, but I appreciated that I didn't know what to expect because of them. Wolverine killing Jean was a fantastic creative liberty, and packed a bigger emotional punch than the comic-accurate alternative would have (in my opinion). ",5x7z96

It isn't an apologist position to recognize that much. Sure DC could have done exactly what Marvel had done, which is take their time, but it wasn't what they wanted to do. DC recognize that they were late to the game, and wanted to replicate the success of Marvel as quickly as possible, to cash in on the trend. 

Snyder was tasked to do that, in one film. With all of that considered, I felt that the finished film was mostly successful toward that goal. Whether or not this resulted in a good film is very debated. Narratively the film was a bit clumsy. But the reality that they built I found enormously compelling, and the conflict between Superman and Batman I found was convincing. Anyway BvS has been debated exhaustively, by others and myself.

Not all heroes are on the scale of Superman thus a story like Logan works well for Wolverine. That's not to say Wolverine isn't a larger than life character as well having survived a nuke in the comics and movie.

They experience two deaths.  What made that person someone they loved is gone, or only appears erratically. So everyday they are reminded of what once was and the cruelness of the present.  When the person does pass they are usually the first ones to bounce back which can be unsettling to other family members but its because they did their mourning in guilty resentful silence, months or years before the body gave out. 

It was a very real portrayal of a situation that plays out everyday all over the world. The biggest sure sign of Logan's love for Charles that he never, ever, ever, no matter how dire the situation gave a moments thought to leaving that wheelchair behind.  That was love in action, that was Logan making sure that Charles had what he needed no matter where they ended up.

There are few hints. First, there is this mystery of wtf happened to the X-Men, did they all get killed by the bad guys or something else? Then after they leave the hotel where Xavier freezes all those people, they are driving in a car and in the radio they say something like ""The incident is similar to the one that happened in Westchester where 600 people were injured and several were killed including a few X-Men."" Or something like that. Logan turns it off right before they say X-Men but it's pretty clear thats what they were going for, since the X-Mansion is in Westchester. 

Later when they are at the farm, Xavier is in the bed and he recalls the accident, he never explicitally says that he killed some X-Men, but he says that he hurt people and that he doesn't deserve this night. Right after the X-24 kills him.

What makes it highly profitable is that it is a modest or even *small* budget film. Had it cost something more typical in the mid or upper hundreds of millions (so roughly thrice the budget) then you'd be looking at something only in break even territory or maybe even a mild failure. 

Once one accounts for the hidden marketing budget, the domestic split with theaters, and the various reasons overseas is less profitable still. 

Even by raw number Deadpool isn't quite so remarkable anymore. Domestically [35 films](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic.htm) have done better and one probably has to do over 400 or 500 million to hope to shake things up.

The villains needed more character development, is all I'm saying. Especially Dr. Zander Rice since he had an actual complex motivation that's just brushed over. His father was experimenting on mutants and he died in an experiment gone wrong, so now Zander wants to kill all mutants and grow mutants of his own. That had potential.

Unfortunately, though, we get told all of that, but shown none of it. And his motivations are never developed in the movie, rather stated. He had the potential to be a deep villain, but he needed to be way more fleshed out. They should have given him more than 3 scenes, considering he's the mastermind, don't you think? And we only learn about his motivations mere seconds before his death, so he was not very impactful throughout the movie, character-wise.

By casting issue I meant that (what I explained below) is that Laura had to speak Spanish and English with her being a main character, where as the other children having little to no lines in the film wouldn't have had to have the language abilities.

Now why do you have to talk out of your ass?

EDIT: also this can only be loosely ralated to previous x men movie in japan because of the Katana easter egg that he got from the japanese guy he saved from atomic bomb explosion. And it is also confirmed that the wolverine movie set in japan was its own thing too. Solo wolverine movies are not part of any on going xmen universe ",5x7z96
degh57k,"Yea, exactly. When i saw the phone. I thought the same thing.",5x7z96
deh235h,"Either/both.  ""Not over-explaining"" seems like a key feature of this movie.

For instance, why are almost all of the bad guy minions missing only their right arm?  Was it an initiation right of passage?  Were they all test subjects forced to shake hands with X-24?  Was the prop guy just really bad at doing left hands?",5x7z96

deiw1lt,"DOFP is Timeline #1. Logan and his *older* friends managed to survive right to the bitter end regardless of the situation.

Logan is Timeline #2. Logan watched all of his said friends die brutally at the hands of Xavier's first seizure and suffered mental trauma.

deo0yqo,"I don't actually know, and someone better versed might have a better answer....

But I took it as him effectively bleeding out at the farm. He's stabbed so many times, he can't recover because he's constantly being damaged and he can't close up the wounds quick enough to heal properly before new ones are being torn open. He's just in a constant state of bleeding and then when he's at a very low level of health he gets impaled. His powers of recovery are still strong enough to keep him alive. I imagine that had he been pulled off what he was impaled on, he would have recovered *eventually*, but seeing as he was in such a poor condition it would take time. But with the serum the process is sped up significantly. 

In contrast, he doesn't incur as much sustained damage in the final scene. He has enough time between injuries that he can regenerate. By the time he gets crushed by the truck he isn't in the same state of serious trauma that he was when he was impaled at the farm. I also assume that the ground gives way a bit, it's earth rather than concrete. Once crushed he can recover because he's not actually incurring further damage, he's just stuck under a pile of rubble which he's strong enough to burst out of. Whereas at the farm he'd suffered more serious trauma and was literally impaled... So he couldn't recover because there was something rammed through his torso, which he wasn't strong enough to pull himself off of. Had he been in better condition when he was impaled, maybe he could have pulled himself off it and started to heal. That would also explain why there is a bit of a time gap between X24 getting crushed, and him bursting out from under the truck - he was hurt badly and stuck lying under the truck, but wasn't incurring any further damage. Therefore he can heal, it takes him a few minutes before he's recovered enough to muster up the strength to burst out from under the truck again.

But that could be nonsense from me haha, just my take on it!

EDIT: a few words for clarity",5x7z96
deo0hla,"He does heal, just not quickly. Scratches and cuts close quickly, organ damage heals more slowly and brain damage will actually kill him. Inconvenient wounds heal themselves, traumatic ones requires Zander. He's a clinical psychologist I'm sure he takes X24 like an animal to obey commands and come to him when harmed. Could even maim him intentionally and then give him the serum to build that trusting relationship. But again all these things are left to your imagination in the film. We get a glimpse of what Zander is capable of with his treatment of the children.

X24 was made to be a  weapon, but a controllable one, which also makes him killable if you know his weakness.",5x7z96
deocuu3,"I know there have been plenty of attempts that have slowed him down, if not killed him outright. But he's come back from being little more than a charred skeleton, so it's not so simple, I guess.",5x7z96
depd498,"Under normal circumstances, Logan's healing factor can heal from virtually any injury except, apparently total destruction of the brain. The adamantium coating of his skeleton means his brain is pretty much impervious to any serious damage, in addition to stopping things such as decapitatin and loss of limbs. But having so much metal in his system poisons him. This slows down his healing factor, since it's constantly busy healing him from the adamantium poisoning, but the loss is small enough that he is still nigh impossible to kill.

The adamantium bullet is the only thing that can pierce Logan's adamantium-coated skeleton, which means it can penetrate his skull and destroy his brain. Normally, that would be one of the few ways - perhaps even the only one - to kill Wolverine. If it were to hit Logan anywhere else, he'd probably be able to heal from it.

However, between the genetically engineered mutant-weakening food, the old age (Logan's about 200 years old) and the adamantium in his skeleton poisoning him, Logan's healing factor has deteriorated to the point where injuries that once healed within minutes at most now need days, weeks or even months to heal and some don't ever fully heal (as seen from the scars he has).

And then the movie happens and Logan sustains a series of grave injuries, many of which would have outright killed anyone else, over the course of no more than 1 or 2 weeks. And he dies because his healing factor just can't keep up any more.",5x7z96

The aftermath of Schism then creates about 5 more years of character development for Scott and Logan and the rest of the X-men. Virtually all the good story lines and character development from the last 8 years of X-men comics have revolved around leading up to or in reaction to the events of Schism.

We can imagine that there could exist such a rule, e.g. ""adamantium is magical and cursed to be poison by Odin"" or ""pure adamantium is unbreakable but the curing process introduces radioactive pollutants"". But right now I don't think we have anything like that so we have to work with what we have.

demf45j,"Alternate to whose perspective?   

From what I understand, X-Men 1-3 were standalone films, with Wolverine's *Origins* movies taking place in the same timeline. When X-Men: First Class came about, it was simply a telling of how the X-Men got started back in the 60s. This was sorta a ""prequel"" to X-Men 1-3. Then Days of Future Past happened, sending Logan's mind to the 70s, and that changed everything, making the grim DOFP future not happening. X-Men: Apocalypse happened after that, in the 80s. As was heavily implied at the end of DOFP that Weapon X/Alkali was still a thing. At the end of Apocalypse, we indeed saw Logan violently escaping Weapon-X/Alkali. This was back in the 80s.  

From what I got, it's implied that Logan happens at one end of the same timeline that the rebooted X-Men continuity happens. Problem is, we have one X-men movie coming up, and if it continues the pattern, this will take place in the 90s. After that is anyone's guess, but if the pattern holds and there's yet another X-Men movie, it will take place in the 2000s. Keep in mind, the scientist from Transigen mentions that they have been pushing the mutant suppressant in the food supply since 2004. So it's definitely still possible the next X-Men movie(s) will show these events developing in the background.   

So bottom line: no, it's the new continuity begun in DOFP, we just haven't seen the events come to bear yet because the X-Men movies are a few decades behind. ",5x7z96

Logan is unlike any other Marvel Super hero film, including MCU. The difference in directing and acting was completely opposite of the quality usually given for a Fox movie (IMHO). While I was ""eh"" about the first X-Men and enjoyed FS a bit more, I generally despise these X-Men films. I'm one of those annoying purists at heart with X-Men. I've been reading their book for 30 years. So knowing how I feel about the past films should tell you how it's changed my opinion of Fox when they want a movie done right. 

I think it started with X-Men: Apocalypse when he cut loose in the Weapon-X facility. The director keyed into that, and delivered a violent and somewhat heart-wrenching film that does Wolverine some proper fucking justice. Hugh, PatStew and Dafne should be proud of what the delivered.

I've been reading the comics since I was a child, and I remember my friends and I talking about ""If they ever made an x-men move, who would be the actors/actresses casted"" and things like that. When the first x-men came out, those very same friends and I watched it, and were VERY high on the anticipation of Wolverine and were not disappointed. Hugh, simply, was as perfect a casting choice as Christopher Reeves was for Superman.

Nearly two decades later, and after a half dozen appearances on the silver screen. And with the same friends. Hugh Jackman brought it all together with Logan, and to see him in a withered shadow of his former self, yet still takes on the same amount of physical and emotional damage is just brutal to witness. The guyt just cannot catch a break.

When he finally died, the tears were partially for the loss felt by Laura, but mostly joy for the fact that Logan no longer has to suffer. To take what he has and still remain good? My friend, this takes much more than a mutant power and an adamantium bone upgrade. His goddamn enormous amount of love and respect he has for life is truly what makes him so freakin powerful.

The thing (at least in my opinion) is that that between the children (for example Laura/X-23) and X-24 there was a change in design philosophy. They saw that they couldn't control fully independent and self conscious mutants, so they went with a more ""limited"" approach.

And there certainly are scenarios where someone like X-24 would be useful. In actual war there often wouldn't be the need for secrecy. It is often times a tactic to limit casualties, but if you are a ""unkillable"" mutant (at least against most things besides adamantium bullets) there is no need to be sneaky.

Do recall that Wolverine was experimented on in a secret facility in Canada, by the father of the doctor running the current program!

Really, that line was added to let the audience feel the kids are somehow safe and the story can be wrapped up. You gotta end the movie somewhere.

Not sure where I'd rate it as a superhero movie. I tend to do my ratings/reviews/thoughts as films and not give them any special place for being any specific kind of film.

If I was to show this to most of my friend that aren't into X-Men I feel like none of them would be giving it the praise its getting here. Thus as a film, on its own, it's not that amazing.... And thus my rating of about a 7.5

degxkkk,"> personally I think the more serious drama focused on the characters really took the film to the next level.

If we are talking drama and seeing superheros worn out/defeated I think Civil War did it **much** better and had much more interesting/engaging writing, scenes and acting. There was so much more going on and almost every character has equally as much of a deep rich story/history as any other that comparing it to Logan just is not fair. Logan tried something on a much smaller scale and failed in various other aspects that Civil War got right.

Of course Civil War is not something I would call being set in reality, but it wasn't going for that. It was living in its own world and that's perfectly fine. It's the closest I can say a superhero movie has reached masterpiece level, especially in the interesting drama department.

I also did not like The Dark night as much as most (I gave it an 8) nor Avengers (Gave this one a 6) for various reasons, so those would be bad examples for me.

I respectfully disagree :) If you think Logan is better then that's fine, I'm not here to tell you you're wrong and my opinion is a fact. I just dont share the same view and respectfully disagree on it being an amazing superhero movie. I can give it unique, for now, but that's about it.",5x7z96

Logan is supposedly around 200 years old by the time this movie takes place. In this timeline, his powers have decayed to the point where he has aged significantly.

dfi9ic2,"I was a bit annoyed by the whole ""kids are being experimented on"" trope and the adobe premiere video. The kids, for obvious reasons, didn't have much acting ability. I guess I knew Proffesor X was inadvertently killing off the farmer's family. Logan really didn't want to stay, and since they strongly hinted at the family getting butcherd it bothered me. X is an interesting character, but with all the movies and going back and forth in time I wasn't really sure I knew who X was anymore. I'm sure there's some elborate explanation as to what exactly happened though between now and Days Of Future Past. I didn't know anything about the movie beforehand, but it was just too easy to see that truffle pig, X and Logan were dead men walking from the very start. 


 Also a lot of the Mexican accents were off, but to be honest if it's years away from our timeline then that might be passable with the mixing of cultures. Accents are lost as generations go on in different countries/cultures and Logan lived closed to the border so it's possible there were a lot of people who didn't speak Spanish well.


It was still the best super-hero movie ever made though, and Logan's death hit me pretty hard, but I couldn't care less for the little girl (who was suprisingly good in her role until she spoke) or her group of bad actors.


I'm also finally getting Superhero/X-men fatigue. Half the movies are great, and half of them are just bad. I'm a big comic book fan, but I honestly can't see myself going to anymore with the exception of Infinity War. Hopefully it'll tie up lose ends and give the people a somewhat proper ending like Logan did. I'd rather see heroes retire/die in that film and have the younger generation (Spider-man, Black Panther, Guardians of The Galaxy, Scarlet Witch) continue their legacy after Infinity War.


I guess my point is that after seeing all these Superhero movies, inlcuding seeing the X-men movies various times, I've just grown tired of characters like Professor X. Good thing happens. Terrible thing happens. Good thing happens. Horrible thing happens. Time Travel. Accidently kills off half the mutants. Dead. It just felt like all the time (and time travel lol) was for nothing in the end. It's more realistic, but after almost two decades of X-men movies I have to say I'm disappointed with its conclusion.


It's just the endless franchises themselves that have gotten me tired. Maybe I'm just out of touch, no, it's the kids who are wrong.

When Xavier got stabbed by X-24 I started to cry a little (cause I can't believe there's any part of Logan - hostile clone or not that would gank Xavier - he's an X-Man goddamnit!) and when Logan died there were tears in my eyes. Maybe it's because I'm 19 now, but I was barely 3 when I saw the first X-Men movie. It was the first proper live action movie I saw of superheroes that was modern, visceral and not set in a dank city like Burton's Batman films. I've grown up with this series and yeah, I know, the young cast is technically still *this* series, but it's over. The one movie series that I could always count on being with me is over now.

dekszky,"Logan takes place in 2029, and no new mutants have been born in 25 years - so any movie with a scene with a mutant in it who was born after 2004 would be out of continuity. This includes the epilogue scene in Days of Future Past - the mansion is still seems to be working as a school for mutants and there are still kids running around.

There's no sign of Moira MacTaggert - who in the X3 continuity is teased as possibly important later but never shows up again, and who in the X-Men First Class continuity appears to be Professor X's wife or life partner for a long time. The lack of any mention of Moira or sign that Professor X was ever married would indicate we're more likely to be in the Patrick Stewart continuity than the James McAvoy continuity. Yeah, maybe Moira died in the mansion or at some other point, but she's never mentioned in a lot of situations where she would likely come up with a dying old man with dementia.

Then again we have Zander Rice, whose father was killed by Wolverine in X:Men Apocalypse when Sophie Turner Jean Grey restored some of Logan's memory and set him loose. Of course Logan could have also killed Zander Rice's father in another timeline. Did he do that? The movie's answer is ""probably,"" kind of hand-waving it away. 

In X:Men Days of Future Past, there's also this weird loop where Mystique finds Wolverine after his future consciousness has left him, and between then and X-Men:Apocalypse she appears to hand him over to the Weapon X program so he can be set loose by Sophie Turner Jean Grey later after having his memory wiped. Why would Mystique do this? And if Sophie Turner Jean Grey did restore his memory (how much of this does she do?), does he remember meeting Mystique? In Logan, his first introduction to any of the main characters from the X-Men movies seems to be the cage-fighting scene in the first X-Men movie, which isn't consistent with all this happening to him in the past, like him fighting a Sentinel in broad daylight in Washington D.C. and then 20 years later nobody recognizing him or knowing who he is.

James McAvoy Professor X has a bunch of stuff going on in his continuity that doesn't really make sense for the current continuity - he had a serum in the 1970s that would suppress his telepathic abilities, and he took it for *years*. One would think it would be useful to treat Professor X's condition, but there's no sign in the movie that it exists. He also is capable of traveling in the Astral Plane, which one would think Professor X might try to use if he were locked in a water tank in Mexico having a panic attack.

Also, and this is really nitpicky, Patrick Stewart as Professor X seems to be bald because he is a bald guy. James McAvoy as Professor X is bald because he got alopecia from fighting Apocalypse. Professor X in Logan has a beard. James McAvoy as Professor X liked to grow beards before he fought Apocalypse. He does keep his eyebrows, but the point is that it seems more feasible for Patrick Stewart Professor X's hair-growing pattern to be from Patrick Stewart Professor X and also this whole conversation is kind of trivial and stupid next to the scale of Logan as a movie.

Speaking of things that are trivial and stupid, it doesn't quite make sense for the Transigen Corporation and the Essex Corporation to coexist and both be going after similar but contradictory evil schemes at the same time. The Essex Corporation was set up in X:Men Apocalypse - and they're run by Mister Sinister, who experiments on mutant genetics, understands the mutant gene, and wants to steal mutant powers for himself. In X:Men Apocalypse, the Essex corporation gathers Wolverine's DNA after his escape. Is Essex the same as Transigen, and there was just an acquisition or name change at some point? Maybe? But Zander Rice's goals are very different from Mister Sinister's goals. It seems pretty clear just from his feel if you're familiar with the source material that Zander Rice in the movie is a sort of combination between Zander Rice in the comics - who creates Laura and is trying to recreate Weapon X, and Mister Sinister, who is more of a world-conquering sort of supervillain who would do things like inject chemicals into the world's food supply - although he wouldn't do it to eradicate mutant genes, I don't think, though he might do it so he controlled the only ones...

At any rate, it all gets confusing and is not consistent between X-Men movies and especially not reconcilable in this movie versus the other two main-line continuities.. The point is that there's a lot of stuff in Logan that disregards other things that are set up in other movies as possibilities or as things that are going to happen in the future at some point, and it seems to swap in some characters or relationships from different continuities, though not a lot of them, in ways that don't quite line up.",5x7z96

""And all the ""these kids are made to be weapons of destruction"" stuff when they clearly weren't showing any characteristics of that.""
- Yep that was the whole point.  [Showing that one kid jumping off the roof showed they were not good weapons so they were all going to be killed.  At the end of the movie it shows that they will fight for themselves and what they want though, not for someone else telling them what to do.](#spoiler)

"" they talk about ""Eden"" all movie long""
-Yes they do!  To emphasize it as a major plot point. [That way when Logan sees it in the comic book, you feel the big let down that he feels.  That it's fake and a kid's dream.  It leaves you guessing as to whether or not someone snuck it into the comic or it was just convenient.  Kinda crappy, I get it.  His death is a metaphor for him finding Eden, or finding peace.  He has to fight his rage, in this case his angry angry clone, to get there.  The best part is that even he can't win against his own rage and it takes Laura to do it.  Going back to the start of the movie, he doesn't give in to his rage to kill those cholos and it's a messy crappy fight.  But when he starts to get angry he wins.  This sets up that rage conflict.  He doesn't want to give in to his rage as it causes him the most problems, but it's how he gets stuff done.  Crappy explanation, sorry.](#spoiler)

""The fact that Professor X, the saviour of mutant race pretty much""
- [Showing Prof. X as this weak old man with mental problems that could kill everyone around him is showing how much he is not the savior.  There are no saviors left until the end of the movie with the kids escaping.  You hear about a lot of events leading to this to show that all of that is in the past.  This is the now and it's depressing and without heroes.](#spoiler)

""but can't even tell Logan the whole story beforehand?""
- Yep!  [She can't tell him, because she knows he will refuse.  He's given up on himself and everyone else and is back to the Logan he was before the X-Men.  He's not The Wolverine that can wreck it up anymore, but she thinks there is enough of him left to get Laura where she needs to go.](#spoiler)

Sabretooth would've been very personal and befitting, since he's one of the few recurring antagonists in Wolverine's mythos and his arch-nemesis, so to speak. I wouldn't have minded seeing Sabretooth, but I enjoyed the fact that it was X24 because of what AssGapeLover said, that it was ""the personification of what Logan had always been fighting.""  Also, with Wolverine being a rundown version of himself in Logan, to see essentially a version of himself in his prime as the villain -- it's a reminder of what he could have been had he not deliberately held himself back from the killing instinct his whole life; had he not kept that final tether to humanity.",5x7z96

deip2uk,"I get where you're coming from if you're saying they were slow. They truly were, but it did serve dramatic purposes.

Regarding the scenes where they *show us* how bleak things are, and how weak Wolverine has become, they add a sense of stakes to the story. The bleakness and the weakness weren't just a background to the events, and they weren't secondary to the story. Not only do they complement the story, but they are an integral element of it. The filmmakers didn't just want to tell us that things are bad, they wanted to show us, and to truly believe it.

As for the farm sequence and the lead-up to it, it served dramatic purposes as well. First of all, Wolverine agreed to help those farmers, which showed him softening up. That's character development. The dinner scene was essential to give Xavier a proper send off. The subplot as a whole leads to the introduction of Dr. Zander Rice and X-24. They had to set them up before we see them again in the third act. The whole thing with the dirty soulless corporation and the water problems set up Transigen. It showed us their reach, their MO, and their dirtiness. It also introduced us to the hill billy rednecks canon fodder, who are later thrown in front of X-24 in a [massacre](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight) to set him up.

1. No new mutants had been born in almost 30 years because of the gene therapy that Alkali had been putting into corn syrup, which is used in almost every modern food product.  

2. The Reavers had used Caliban in the past to track and hunt down mutants, and their efforts had been going on for quite some time. ",5x7z96

deubjx1,"> The details are all there if you actually listen and think critically.

To be fair, there are a lot of details that are so barely touched on that people wouldn't know they were there without a second viewing of the film or having prior knowledge to look for it. 

A prime example of this is the radio talking about what happened to the xmen. They touched on it for like 5 seconds in a small ""radio"" chatter.

I went into the movie knowing what to look for, and i was still barely able to catch it. i went to the theater in a group of 7 people, and no one else knew what had happened with xavier and the xmen.",5x7z96
dettyza,"But all of that information was there. It was hinted at, the events were explained by other characters, the characters themselves said it.

It just wasn't blatant exposition where the movie stops for a minute or two to tell you exactly what happened through a flashback or a character explaining it in detail.

Charles Xavier is very old. He has Alzheimers or ALS or some degenerative brain disease. He's also an incredibly powerful telepath who, when losing control of his mind, causes violent telekinetic mindquakes.

These happened TWICE in the movie and were brought under control through medicine.

Professor X seems distraught by something he had done earlier but couldn't remember. He desperately asks Wolverine what he did. Wolverine brushes him off and goes to talk to Caliban, who is scared shitless of the Prof vaporizing him with his mindquake. He says that unlike Wolverine, he's not indestructible and even a minute of the mindquake almost killed him.

After the second mindquake at the Casino, which leaves almost everyone in the building severely injured, Charles is again visibly distraught as they wheel him out and is chanting ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry"".

A few minutes later a news cast reports on the mindquake in the casino that left hundreds injured, and says the incident is similar to one that happened a year ago in Westchester, New York, killing 7 mutants and injuring hundreds. Westchester NY is where the X-Mansion is.

At exactly this point everyone who's been paying attention knows what happened. Charles went senile and lost control, killing every X-Man who's not Wolverine. My wife and I both looked at each other at that moment, with the identical progression of facial expressions that said ""oh shit"" and then ""poor Charles"".

In a later scene at the farmhouse Charles finally remembers what he did and expresses remorse. This is mostly for emotional closure for the character, but also to explicitly confirm that yes, this is in fact what happened.

I didn't get any of this knowledge from outside sources. In fact, I have read a single X-Men comic in my entire life, as a kid in the early 90s, and I remember nothing about it except Magneto was in it and so was Wolverine, whom some people called Logan. The only backstory I have is what I've seen in the previous X-Men movies. I saw the movie once in a theater and am recalling this from memory.

I can't think of a more tactful way to put this, but basically you shouldn't blame a movie because you didn't or couldn't pay attention to information that was clearly there for all to see.

I can only hope that you are very young, and will at some point learn to understand basic narrative and figure out how to spell monosyllabic words like ""heal"".",5x7z96
detmxek,It's better for a story to leave you thinking than to spoon feed you every bit of exposition. There are hints in the dialogue that tell you what's happening and what happened. You don't need more than that. This is coming from someone who's never touched an X-Men comic.,5x7z96

So don't worry about it. And this time they specifically said they did not try to fit the movie in the timeline and made it its own thing. Just go and experience it for what it is, and forget this even takes place in any universe other than its own.",5x7z96
deh28po,"I see what you mean. There's like *one* easter egg from The Wolverine and it's not really anything special (we see a samurai sword in his bedroom, that's about it). And IIRC The Wolverine had a romantic subplot more than a ""daughter"" theme right? I mean the first X-Men had a ""daughter"" theme so I guess it ties in with that.

Considering that this is (allegedly) post-DOFP I don't even think The Wolverine is in the same timeline as this one. 

Idk, the closest I can think of the two is that The Wolverine introduced the notion of Logan hating his immortality which I think is explored a bit more here. You could also argue the post-credits scene leads into this one a little bit (it mostly leads into DOFP though). Personally I don't think you need to watch The Wolverine to get this one. The only ones I really think you need to see are the first two and maybe DOFP to really understand Logan's relationship with Charles, and even those aren't that necessary.

EDIT: A word",5x7z96

Spider-Man had a similar situation with Sony. But the Amazing Spider-Man movies started to crash and Sony saw the writing on the wall so they struck a deal with Marvel to share the movie rights.

Fun fact: the reason Marvel sold these rights off to begin with is because years and years ago Marvel had to file for bankruptcy so they were trying to get as much money as possible.

At the very end of the movie, [it is explained that the x-gene has been suppressed by manipulating the food supply.  I think they specifically mention high fructose corn syrup.  Once they had eliminated naturally occurring mutants the next step was to design new mutants they could control in a lab. ](#spoiler)  This is the explicit explanation for why there have been no mutants in 25 years, and the heavily implied reason for why the few remaining mutants have waning superpowers.",5x7z96
demfeus,"[Logan addressed it a few times that adamantium in his body was killing him. When speaking with Rice he says,""You're father was the one who put this poison in me"". That's a paraphrase of course, but that's just one example of when they addressed him dying. I don't recall them outright saying that he had lung cancer, but it was heavily implied. The combination of adamantium poisoning his body, the lung cancer, and his wounds from fighting were just too much for his body. So he died.](#spoiler)

You mentioned earlier that you're German so I'm guessing German may be your first language. It may not be a bad idea to watch the movie a second time in your native tongue and then reconsider your position; or at the very least, rewatch the movie and look for these points. ",5x7z96
demf0xa,"[Logan was dying because the body was rejecting the adamantium. I think they had Pierce mention something along those lines as well as Caliban mention that there is something poisoning him at the beginning of the movie. There is actually a more thorough explanation but it involves the comic lore and I'm sticking strictly to the film.](#spoiler)

[As for Xavier, he is the most powerful telepath in the world and he has been developing Alzheimer's (such as how he doesn't seem to know who Logan is at the beginning and has forgotten what happened to everyone until the scene in the farm house) as well as Seizures which can happen with no outside cause at all and are probably related to his degenerating brain. Couple this with being unable to control his powers (and the last time that happened he was rendered weak and before that lost all of his hair) and it isn't much of a stretch to see that he is being killed by them (the powers). Plus the guy is easily over 90 years old.](#spoiler)",5x7z96
dero4tq,"I'll give you that much with the chemical. The only thing I could figure out is that it enhances mutations? But in the case of Old Man Logan, his healing factor would have sapped him of most of his energy by using it. Hence why they said to not use the whole bottle? 

The other possibility I've come up with is the solution IS his mutation. In mutants without the mutation it would allow them to heal, though slowly. With Logan it may allow him to temporarily have full healing factor but at the cost of having nasty side effects after it wears off. Or, that it only allowed him to heal as much as was in the bottle.

If someone wants to jump in and correct me or add more please do. 

Edit: So the chemical allowed him to heal, but the doctor who he saw shortly before they fled to North Dakota also said he couldn't take anymore wounds. I'm assuming that once it wore off, he simply had become too mortal, and succumbed to his injuries. ",5x7z96
desflfv,"I searched around a bit on the internet and apparently this is cannon... dort off.

The process used to bond adamantium to Wolverine's skeleton was a crude and incomplete one, a beta test if you would. A side effect of this is that the adamantium became poisonous to its host.

delrzjv,she was raised as a killing machine but as we saw the nurses did things to try and give the children some humanity. giving them names and birthdays etc. also remember that Laura read a ton of xmen comics and that she already knew Logan was her father(this can be inferred bc the nurse knew and probably told her and also laura would see the resemblance between her abilities and Logans). Laura wasnt just a killing machine and a week is definitely long enough for a strong emotional bond to develop(esp for a child). ,5x7z96
delrg0u,"Okay sure, but she had never been shown compassion by anybody other than the nurse. Having X and Logan show her that, she probably attached pretty quickly. Also, the nurse made a point to say that the children didn't want to be soldiers. The whole point was the she WASN'T just the killing machine they wanted her to be. They had failed.",5x7z96
delq36v,"Yeah Logan clearly always has been someone who tends to run away and stay on his own. But if you think about it he actually always comes back for her in the movie. Regardless whether his intentions may be the right ones and she clearly pushes herself onto him.

* He comes back to the motel, although money is the motivator here

* he comes back to her (admittedly by basically running her over) when transigen first shows up

* he saves her in the process of saving Charles in the casino 

* Yes on the farm he first ignores her and goes to try and save Charles, but in the end he still saves her. 

* He tries to leave after Charles funeral, but can't and she drags him to the doctor, but in the end they are both on their way to north Dakota. And once they arrive there he actually refuses the money that should have been his sole motivator at that point if he didn't care about her at all.

* He leaves the children alone once they are united and want to cross the border, but still comes after them once he sees they are in danger sacrificing himself at the end.

But yes, the movie clearly left a lot of blanks to fill in for the viewer. Which in some parts may be bad, but in others clearly something good (compared to the usual pg13 movies that spell everything out). And it is also the end of a very long saga with wolverine, so the movie while still working as a standalone draws a lot from the viewer's knowledge of the previous ones.",5x7z96

delomcq,I was thinking the same thing until I remembered all of the comics she was reading. She idolized Wolverine. ,5x7z96
delp3xj,"I would see it as a parallel for wanting a family. The nurse probably talked about Logan to her giving her hope for a family. She has a killing instinct while she still has her child traits that the nurse helped her develop (Birthday cake, Comic books, etc.). So Laura maybe had this idea for more than a week. Like kids meeting their parents for the first time in person and experiencing an act of love they've been longing for (in Logan's case: saving them)

Like a father away from home. Maybe, the nurse tells Laura she has a father to give her hope and chance for happiness with a family to cheer her up so she doesn't try killing herself. The nurse knew nothing about Logan's true personality except he did good before. 

If Logan didn't come back for her, I don't think she would be upset. The turning point was that Logan did come back for her. She felt that love and connection. That hope of a possibility family with Logan is crushed. 

This coupled with all the crap they went through with seeing what happened with Professor X. She was visually upset.

TL:dr... it wasn't so much the father-daughter relationship as much as the hopes of reuniting with a family. (Like Professor X telling Logan what a family is supposed to be like.)",5x7z96

I could almost feel the pain she must have felt. The longing... almost tasting it and having it snatched away so violently.

I'm sure others have made the following connection. Sure Logan just met her and was told that she's genetically his. He was at rock bottom. He was a really bad day away from using that adamantium bullet.

But to Laura, he was her father. She knew him. Even if it was just stories there was a connection there for her. I'm sure that she somehow found out who her father was and read the comics so that she could learn about him. I could also empathize with Laura on the feeling of loss she must have felt.

(I left this tab open for like a day and am just now finishing this)
I just watched CB19's review of ""Logan"". She made some fantastic points on just what was wrong with this portrayal of the Wolverine. I highly recommend  [checking it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4JzxAeHwjs). 

I think the biggest thing I took away from CB19's thoughts is that, male and females are taking this movie in totally different ways. So for her, Logan not stepping up at all was a huge let down. And after a few days of reflection, I would say that it's a critism that I share with her. Every time we saw Laura get just a little closer to Logan, he pulled away, or pushed her away, which is understandable in my book. I felt let down that it took him to be dying to show her love.

dehn7xv,"They leave things purposefully unexplained early on because the explanations later in the film are the ""reveal"". And everything you say was not explained WAS explained, so maybe pay more attention to the movie if you watch it again.

1. It shows how crappy Logan's life is, how he's an alcoholic, a former superhero who is relegated to driving a limo for lowlifes. It's building up the world and developing the character for the viewer.

2. Xavier took over his twins body at the end of X3, I'm not sure if you caught that. The end of Days of Future Past also shows him alive and well.

3. The movie says Xavier has Alzheimers. His seizures caused him to lose control of his telepathy and injure 600 people and kill seven in what is called ""The Westchester incident"", so he and Logan had to go on the run to Mexico.

4. Logan's healing factor has started to fail and the adamantium on his bones is poisoning him. He says this in the movie in a conversation with X-23. None of it is ""cheesy mumbo-jumbo"".

5. You don't like family ties. It's not a plot hole that she wanted to save the children she helped take care of for years from being euthanized/murdered by Transigen. She had 20k to pay Logan, she lied about there being another 30k when he got them there.

6. I agree, that's a bit of a stretch that they seemed so focused on running at the end that they didn't use their powers.

7. Again, you're annoyed by the character development that is getting this movie near universal praise with fans and critics.

8. X24 is not a ""mystery"". Gabriella said he was ""a monster without a soul"" and he is the reason they start killing the kids off. Zander clearly said that he was created by Transigen after the kids they had born were ""failures"" in that they could not be controlled and started to lash out against their captors.

dety524,"The radio audio is actually a bit garbled in the movie but **it actually was** ***7*** surprisingly enough. I checked a screenrip's audio (replaying that section over and over, even slowing it down to 0.75x/0.5x multiple times to try to hear it better) and they say this exactly (not the full quote, just the part relating to Westchester): ""many are noting a similarity to the Westchester incident over a year ago that left over six hundred (600) injured and took the lives of seven (7) mutants, including several of the X-Men"" (Wolverine turns the radio off at exactly this point). The ""seven mutants"" is garbled together somewhat like ""sevenmutants"" yet with a more partial/light ""n"" involved, so if you heard it quickly it isn't really clear that it's ""seven"" rather than ""seventy"". After what must have been literally 20-30 replays of that particular segment I'm having difficulty trying to deliberately hear it as ""seventy"" in any way and am absolutely confident that it's ""seven"", but on replay #1 I definitely thought ""seventy"" was significantly more likely than ""seven"", and it really took the repeated playthroughs combined with the slowing it down to make it clear that it was definitely *not* ""seventy"" (the ambiguity present initially faded as I kept replaying it, and the ""n"" with the lack of a ""ty"" became very clear, especially at 0.75x).",5x7z96

demxmqq,Actually in the comics x-24 loses his memory and takes up the wolverine mantle.. ,5x7z96
dewh6l8,"In X-Men Origins, Wolverine's real name was James Logan. In this movie, the X-23 documents list him as James Howlett (which is the comicbook accurate name). I took that, the in-universe X-Men comics/ action figures and Charles saying Logan was a barbituate addict when they met as a means to convey that the X-Men movies were fictional movies in this universe, that ""Got about a quarter of it right"" as Logan says. As such, I think the adamantium bullets in Origins were a Hollywood plot device (especially since it is also not comicbook canon at all).


Or this was just a larger/ more powerful round.",5x7z96
deioads,"It looked like X-24's adamantium skull got bent out of shape badly. I reckon X-24 or Logan's healing couldn't bent it back into shape and he'd be left with a hole in his head from where the skull can't regenerate.

If this doesn't kill him he'd definitely be a vegetable and the scientists would probably just make another X-24 rather than find a way to heat up his skull enough to bend it back into place and allow the bone to regrow properly.",5x7z96
demagzn,"Maybe not. Depending on the caliber of the weapon of there was nothing left to heal, it's possible it could have worked.

X-24 was shot in the back of the head, and it blew off the upper portion of his face/skull showing Laura behind him as he dropped to his knees. It's my belief that this killed X-24",5x7z96

deuicoh,"It's implied in a lot of the comics that if Wolverine's head is damaged beyond repair he could logically be killed. The only reason it hasn't happened before is because his spine has adamantium on it, so it's extremely hard to sever a neck covered in an invulnerable metal. I choose to believe Logan had that adamantium bullet made at an extremely high caliber in order to make sure he was 100% dead and couldn't revive from it.",5x7z96
dekvcv4,"X-24 could still revive from it and probably will, but like in Origins it takes him long enough that the children could get away and be untrackable",5x7z96
df0oi80,"I don't know, as far as I can remember he's never suffered a brain injury before - at least in all the movies... thing is, he's been shot in the head before but that's basically just a flesh wound because his bones are covered in adamantium. ",5x7z96
df7ixl4,I had seen the difference coming down to the gun and bullet used. In Origins wasn't it a less powerful caliber used on Logan? In this movie it was a pretty big bullet and a pretty powerful gun,5x7z96
dhw5c1e,It's possible they also gave him less adamantium which is why the bullet tore such a massive hole through it,5x7z96

delpyq9,ah okay so that has pros and cons i guess,5x7z96
deu7kba,"Ah, okay, that's interesting. Is this true in the comics as well that Laura doesn't have the full skeleton of adamantium? Wouldn't that make her really dangerously vulnerable in a number of ways? I mean when Wolverine is covered in adamantium, nothing short of adamantium can penetrate that. If someone shot Laura in the head, she'd presumably loose her memory like Logan did when he was shot in the head with an adamantium bullet. Major weakness right there. Plus this means her bones can be shattered, her limbs can be cut off (even though they'll regrow it's worse to loose the limb), she isn't immune to nuclear bombs (lol), she's much more vulnerable to having her head cut off (no adamantium-reinforced vertebrae makes that far too easy, plus it also makes her super vulnerable to spinal cord damage (even though it would heal) which adamantium would have been able to protect almost completely -- in both cases with adamantium you basically have to use a slim blade at exactly the right spot, while without it you can just slice through or shatter the vertebrae), etc...",5x7z96

One, she and the other kids she's with are the last of the mutants. Not literally the last, but none have been born for ages and they're relatively young. They are weapons but they're the last of them (or soon will be) so they need to acknowledge their own power and responsibility.

Second, there is no need to be afraid anymore. No more guns in the valley means no more sources of danger. Presumably across the border is a safe haven like they said it would be, and for that reason they can rest easy and 'go home to [their] momma.'",5x7z96

They were able to do all this because Charles inadvertently killed the X-Men when he had a ""brain attack"". Since Magneto never turned extremist since what happened in Apocalypse, there was no Brotherhood of Mutants to protect mutant-kind either, in fact he might have been at the school when the attack happened and Charles got him, too.

Reenable the potential for mutant births by reversing the effects of the foodborne ""mutant vaccine"". 2. Permanently immunize the host against the foodborne ""mutant vaccine"".

(it's strongly implied that the foodborne suppression acts very much like a vaccine, so even if they immediately stopped distributing the foodborne suppression agent, the entire world population would still be unable to have mutant children until the mutant birth suppression effect either wore off sufficiently (could take years or decades, might never wear off) or a sufficiently large generation of unexposed new births had grown to maturity (any lingering food supplies containing the suppressant will delay this further, and if the suppressant was designed to modify genetics in a heritable fashion, it's actually possible that it would be impossible for even unexposed children to have children of their own with the mutant gene unless the heritable genetic change was directly reversed).)",5x7z96

However the question sort of becomes where does *Logan* fit? I've heard it is supposed to be in the new-timeline, meaning everything we see the younger cast do eventually ends up at *Logan*. Kind of neat if they stick to it.

More likely they will say that *Logan* occurred in the other timeline or they will do some more time travel to hand-wave it away. Sad to lose the connectivity of it all, but fine I guess.",5x7z96

As soon as Logan was sent back in time in DoFP, it created a new timeline, so the past part and the very end of DoFP, and Apocalypse are a part of that new timeline.

It is assumed that because there is no more dystopia that Logan is also a part of that new timeline (or it could be a part of the old timeline where the dystopia of DoFP never happened).

He takes two more of professor X's seizures by the end of the movie and he's healing significantly worse after each one, until he gets that final impaling which he would have laughed off in the earlier films. ",5x7z96

After watching this, and really thinking about X-men as a 17 year franchise whole, Wolverine was a wasted character. Honestly, most of the franchise was wasted, but Wolverine especially to me.

Also, the lack of a cohesive full on franchise solid continuous story line really fucks this up for me too.  It's like scooping peanut butter and jelly on a plate with out bread.

In general to cut something you have to have a harder material. Cut iron with steel, etc. Adamantium being the hardest material means that Weapon X/Stryker had no way to manipulate it other than when it was in its liquid form. 


I don't think they ever really established in the movies that Magneto can manipulate electromagnetism on a molecular level. If they had he could have just shredded everything like Jean did in X3. They basically just had him use magnetism to pull on Logan's skeleton in multiple directions, hence [why the claws spread in X1 on the train.
](https://youtu.be/zS_szvIxbAo?t=46)


A normal lead/steel bullet doesn't work on Wolverine because it's a much softer metal so it can't penetrate adamantium. An adamantium bullet vs an adamantium skull just means the special properties (hardness and therefore strength) of adamantium are cancelled out and simple physics applies. It's no different than shooting a lead bullet at a lead target. The speed/force and (therefore kinetic energy) of the bullet in a tiny area overcomes the strength of that tiny area of adamantium it hits. It has to be a hell of a force difference though like a bullet, not just another piece of adamantium slicing it.

Think of it as a timer he got to reset everyday for all of his life and only when he got affected by the ""cure"" did his ability to reset that clock disappear. It's still slower than everyone elses clock but no longer infinite.

""is he going to be okay?""  And then they make him a nice burial and continue on to Canada.

Doesn't seem super consistent for them to suddenly be useless when its convenient.. not just 1 of them all 20 of them switch from being useful killing guy with power to useless standing there doing nothing and being mute while watching Logan die.

deocxax,"He could I think. In theory it would just bounce off and really hurt. 
In the comics there are various stages of Adamantium. 
First there was Proto-Adamantium the mystery metal that makes up cap's shield but a guy made it one time and it can't be recreated.
True Adamantium is what Wolverine is laced with, an attempt to recreate proto, but then his body changed it into Adamantium Beta because it doesn't interfere with his body's natural processes. Which also makes the concept of him being ""poisoned"" by his skeleton rather weak imo unless you buy his healing factor slowing with age but by that point Logan should be around 139 since via Origin (comic series) he was ambiguously born in the 1890s somewhere. So he was in his 90s and past that in his ""prime"" with the X-Men but there was no decrease in his performance or healing other than the normal handwaves to make him beatable or weak (like the several times his healing has been ""short circuited"") so what changed in 30 years or so that didn't affect him the last 100+? 

TL:DR
-Other than narrative reasons to tell the story the way they wanted there's no real reason that Wolvie should be slowing down on healing, and even with the precedent of Wolverine: Origins using adamantium bullets to make him amnesiac there's no real reason I know of that such a bullet would be able to kill him (or X-24 for that matter)

The things you point out are minor and easily resolved. Why not mention Moria? Because maybe she is dead and Charles obviously didn't have his full memory for the entire movie and maybe he actually killed her. Seems like a good enough reason...

Where was the serum? Maybe it didn't work because he developed a tolerance to it. Or perhaps they just don't have a top secret lab to synthesize serums anymore.

Every film where someone is being chased, the viewer would only get a completely vague explanation where they are going to escape. Like, yeah, we are going to run to the hills over there, but why there, hey who cares. Nobody told you why the hills are magically the place that saves them and why the people chasing can't get there. It would definitely be easy for the writers! It is not expansion of the story, it is part of the story. Just like it's a part of the story why some major character dies. Or maybe that should remain unexplained as well. Who cares, someone just died, it's not relevant why, where or how. Just come up with whatever you like, right? It was cancer, no diabetes, actually it was bullet. Who shot it?

Days of Future Past definitely doesn't work. Logan says that there have been no mutants born in the last 30 years--the movie takes place in 2029, Days of Future Past is set in 2023, and it ends with Logan teaching at the school (with mutant children running about), so it obviously hasn't been 20+ years since a mutant was born.

And yet still wanted a supervillain, leaned on the lamest tropes of Wolverine fighting himself. This shit happens in every lazily written action movie. The hero fighting his former teammate or basically a carbon copy of himself. You seem to want to assume I don't like this movie for reasons that aren't valid when I could give you plenty.

The bullet hitting more adamantium likely resulted in a shower of adamantium being spread all throughout the resulting wound, which directly inhibited the healing factor. Since it was a huge part of his brain taken out, that's likely going to lead to death, as he's not getting any more green juice out there to kick-start he healing.

On the other hand, if X24 does recover, without his puppetmaster, he's going to have a similar origin to Logan - lost in the woods and basically feral.

As the viewer, we know Logan's history of being flighty and so we understand that what can be seen for some people as a lack of care is actually Logan going out of his way in some instances to save this girl.

As for the story of the second half there were just so many loose ends. Not killing the head-scientist, the soldiers not just surrounding the camp during the night, the guy with the gold tooth surviving two military-grade hand grenades under a foot from him.

Further, I just never got invested enough in the girl and the kids to see it in any way justifiable that Wolverine, Professor X & Caliban died because of her/them. In addition to that, all the innocent people getting murdered in their wake (not least the family at the farm). I found myself agreeing more with the scientist in the end, because what the hell are the kids going to do in Canada and how radically changed is the world that Canada and the US' relations are like that.

It would have been better had they just used ""intellectual property"", but they decided to use some hot topic keywords that people love to tirade about without even understanding what they are talking about.

You do not ""copyright"" a weapon. You do not own something if you patent it (you own the right to exclude others from using it). The government puts fluoride in your water to protect your teeth, not to weaken your will. GMO foods are safe. Chem trails are not what you think they are.

I mean, sure she'd be more vulnerable but she probably wouldn't be as gun-hoe as Wolverine as a result, and she still fairs much better than any character without a healing factor.

Also, the memory loss thing from Origins only applies in this universe if you want it to. AFAIK it's not canon, and to be honest that movie is such a mess I wouldn't be too quick to pay much attention to what they established.

The Nimrod Sentinels were a hell of a lot more lethal than the Reavers and each had a built in X gene detector.

Thinking about it... If DoFP starts off at the same timeline as X1-3, and X3 showed a sentinel in the Danger Room, that would imply that the Nimrods didn't appear until years after X3 and probably not long after *The Wolverine* as well.  That puts them at around 2012-2013 or something.  Then DoFP starts off at 2024, I believe, which then gives us about a 10-12 year time span for the Sentinels to kill off all the mutants.",5x7z96

Like, it's great at what it does, but at no point in the film was there any real sense of loss or impending doom. Nothing is fundamentally different about the MCU than before the film, and Zemo's plan has no real sense of dread to it because we know for a fact the Avengers are going to reunite and do 5 more films together.

I didn't say that is what made it good. What I am saying is smaller threats raise the stakes for audiences because the potential for loss is possible. Avengers is not a bad movie but we know the world isn't going to end, we know no one is going to die. Its a fun ride, but there are no real consequences.

But I'd be lying if I said I didn't want Logan to shove his claws into Xavier's skull on more than one occasion. **Not only did I want Wolverine to give Charles a quick, clean three-pronged death to his skull during several points in the movie, but he should have done it long ago before the events of the film**....

.... unless Charles happened to have had ""the"" one and only  episode that killed off all of the mutants in the world -- which could have ***only*** come as a result of Charles going through his first ever seizure while being under Cerebro....  with zero previous medical hints or symptoms to display even a year 0.1% risk of him going through a mutant holocaust-inducing seizure. 

Like a famous superhero once said, ""if we think that there's even a 1% chance then we have to treat it as an absolute certainty,"" which makes a lot more sense here regarding Logan's treatment of Charles than of Batman's treatment of Superman, who had shown zero threat to Earth and had only intentionally kill one life form, which was in Italy and threatening to kill a family of four -- which, by the way, qualifies as transferred self-defense since he used the  lethal force proportionate to the lethal threat being imposed upon the family. 

It really makes me wonder why he didn't kill Xavier off after maybe the 3rd or 4th incident of Xavier killing mutants, since he kills only in bunches (before the events of the film, leading to the meager population of mutants) -- especially after even one episode where Charles goes Sandy Hook at his own school and kills dozens of children-students. 

It's not in Xavier's character nor Logan's character to let Xavier continue to live if he poses a threat of ***piecemeal genocide*** every time he simply happens to pull a regular ""old man mistake"" and forget to take -- or god forbid, bring/have on him -- the medicine to still his fits. 

Nonetheless I don't believe that he killed all the mutants *in the world* simply through one episode, which absolutely means that Charles had to have thought about killing himself for the greater good and safety of the mutant race. Instead, he put them on the brink of extinction and set mutant-kind back to the scariest stage of humankind where there were literally maybe 7-8 humans. 

I'm pretty sure that Days of Future Past Charles wasn't a mentally frail, unstable old man properly described as being a living weapon of mass destruction.

If he doesn't slaughter the fuck out of these guys, everyone he cares about is going to die. So he goes into full primal rage mode. He wasn't thinking logically, it was all fight or flight.

""gl, 24! it was him who did it!"". so stupid. the doctors evil speech: everybody just standing, talking, it looks like some theater stage, that complex situation is reduced to that. a possible solution would be the kids helping logan to fight x24. another that the kids are struggling with soldiers who are, say, duly equiped to deal with them. i dont know, anything, you working with an interesting scenario, high stakes, powerful kids, security forces, berserk logan, and you come up with that unimaginative, linear, boring final fight? it makes no sense, but yeah, the movie was excellent up to this point.",5x7z96

As for Suicide Squad, piece of shit movie. Wasn't such a disappointment because I wasn't expecting much, but it does go to show that WB are desperate for the money making MCU formula, so they try to replicate their ""funny and friendly"" style with SS, and it sucks. 

That's also why I believe BVS was crammy, we can't put it all on Snyder because I think he has potential (I for instance think MOS was amazing).

Plus Batman doesn't dance like ass for 10 minutes.

Only the big directors such as Spielberg, Scorsese, Fincher and Nolan have that kind of role in big movies. Even marvel doesn't give their directors that much power.

>The second is just before Charles is murdered. He's just recalled the event, and that he killed all those people.

They did mention that the tracker was used to hunt down other mutants, but it didn't sound like they exterminated every single one.

Ok so first we have the first 3 X-Men movies and first two Wolverine movies(First 2 X-Men movies are pretty good, third is bad, first wolverine movie is pretty bad with a few bright spots, second is good with some bad spots). This universe ends Days of Future past which I'll get to later but this is where Patrick Stewart is Prof. X, and Ian McKellen is Magneto.

Then the reboot starts with First Class which takes place in the 60's, and in Days of Future Past evil robots kill most of the mutants in the first timeline, and Wolverine leaves that timeline alters the past and the reboot timeline becomes the main one, and in the old one Wolverine is a history teacher at Xaviers school.

Now placing Deadpool and Logan in these becomes difficult, Logan is in the future, however the Sentinal war doesn't look to have happened, it doesn't look like there was a genocide in America in Logan. However the ending of Days of Future Past there are new mutants in the school. I think officially that's where they lie though even if it doesn't fully make sense but they were OK with that to tell a good story.

Overall if you liked Logan, I recommend in order:

Deadpool(a comedy, though great and unique), X-Men 1 and 2, The Wolverine, First Class, and Days of Future Past if you want to get more into the franchise. The others are a bit more mediocre and X-Men Origins Wolverine is bad, almost schlocky so it has some funny moments at least. ",5x7z96

When did he spend two hours trying to leave her behind? Also, she was literally forced on him. He isn't bad for not being enthusiastic about going on a dangerous mission as an old and sick man to get this girl who was created from his DNA without his consent to where she wants to go. 



> Charles does a better job of quickly improving when Laura shows up, but he still is confused and selfish and dangerous.


Not sure how him having a degenerative brain disease and having seizures that although can seriously injure and kill people, are out of his control makes him not a good man. Also, how is he selfish?

I just don't feel like as a movie it's that good. The two big issues I had with it (Acting and pacing) already disqualify it from being a highly rated for me. Genre and settings are not relevant for those issues.

I've got 315 movies rated on IMDb [Here](http://www.imdb.com/user/ur45804867/) and only 11 of them are 10/10's, and from those there's only one there I would not stand by (I'll be revisting Doctor Strange soon and most likley dropping it.)

It takes a lot to get a high rating from me, a 10/10 in my world means it's a **classic** and you should be able to watch the movie at any time period and still love it.

My 9s and 8's are also reserved for movies that are 80-90% good with few faults.

I felt like Logan is neither of these, even on superhero movie level. I know I think Civil war is the better movie, it was going for a certain theme, style, acting skill, story and it **nailed** it. This movie nailed the theme and story but was lacking in 2 very critical areas. I'm not going to give it a high rating just because it did one or two things right that have yet to be done in a superhero film.

He says that what's in the water, food, everything ingested globally is something which inhibits expression of the gene (which means that the gene is there but the proteins it would ultimately express are shut down). In theory (and I doubt they thought this out or looked it up) something that could do that would probably do the same thing to constantly regenerating tissue.

Easiest question to counter my point would probably be:
But why do Caliban, Xavier, Laura and all her friends have powers?

- Caliban and Xavier's powers are brain based - once your central nervous system forms that's more or less it. So their powers are good.
- Laura and the kids were raised like live stock and probably given special food without the contaminant chemicals in it. Artificial selection like you'd do with cattle. They were out in the real world for a week or so - not long enough for powers like Laura's to be affected like Logan.

Logan probably would have been fine if it wasn't for the adamantium in his skeleton: that definitely didn't help - but it can't be the sole contributing factor, because Logan takes place in 2029 - only 6 years after Days of Future Past (2023).

There's multiple storylines for most comics. This just happens to be one of the darker alternate timelines. This happens to be along the same timeline as the reboot, where Wolverine returned to the past and effectively ended the eradication of mutants by Sentinels. (Days of Future Past)

This began in First Class and continued after DoFP with Apocalypse. This story takes place in 2029. 

Wolverine is 200 years old. Xavier is around 90-100 if you go off the timeline given from First Class. Which was in the 50s/60s. They're still human, and always have been. The only difference is they mutated in the womb and came out as superhumans with unique abilities. 

Wolverine was born with his mutation. He is one of (if not) the mutant with the highest healing factor in the series. The reason he even has adamantium infused onto his skeleton is because of a program called Weapon X, developed by William Striker. Without his ability to heal at a rapid rate, he would have died during the procedure. The other notable recipient of adamantium infused onto their skeleton is Lady Deathstrike. You see her in X2, but she is mostly known for her appearances in the X-Men comic books.

I won't pretend that Charles' powers, just like Logan's regenerative abilities, aren't often stretched or cut short as much as the plot needs, but those sorts of long-range uses of his powers are mostly seen used with help of the Cerebro.

For Logan specifically, it's interesting to see what it pulls from the original X-Men movie continuity and what it pulls from the subsequent reboot continuity in crafting its story.

I prefer to think of it as a sequel to the original timeline since they mentioned the statue of liberty in it from the first x-men movie.

This is like saying you don't understand the words ""They put food in the refrigerator so that it wouldn't spoil"" because you're not an engineering major and don't know how refrigerators work on a technical level, and you're not a microbiologist in order to understand spoiling. You don't need to, you just need to understand that refrigerators keep things cool and food left out goes bad.

You don't need to understand genetics to make sense of ""we used genetically modified corn to stop people having mutants"", when in an earlier scene another character points to giant fields of geneticially modified corn and says ""They are putting the syrup in everything people eat and drink"". 

Both of these bits of information were a single 5 second bit of plain English embedded in exciting scenes. You can't possibly have been ""bored"" by them. You just weren't paying attention to what people were saying.

Here's a tip for future movie watching - no script writer ever has a character refer to something like this for no reason, complete with CGI shots of freakishly large corn plants and towering auto-harvesters.

delll96,"Ok, plot holes isn't the proper term.  The plot didn't have any major holes in it.  But I definitely paid close attention and there were a bunch of things that just didn't add up for me.  Here are my beefs, in no particular order:

Why was Charles in the oil tub in the beginning?  They said it was to limit the damage he could do with his seizures?  But then fifteen minutes later in the movie he's completely coherent and under control because of the medication.  He had medication the entire time.  I know Caliban mentioned the dosage was too low but then why didn't we see any seizures in the rest of the movie?

Why did Charles' attack at the casino paralyze the entire world besides Logan?  If it's due to the healing factor, why was the X23 paralyzed as well?  Maybe he was trying to exclude Wolverine from the effects but that would imply control that I don't think he had.
 
Why were they speaking to Laura in English the entire movie when they assumed she only spoke Spanish?  Then she starts yelling at him in Spanish in the truck... but she heard him speaking in English the entire time up to that point.  This is a pretty small nit but it just didn't make sense to me.
 
Why did the bad guys continue to send soldiers after the kids when Laura single-handedly killed like 20 of them at Logan's home in Mexico?  Why would they continue to pursue the kids on foot when they could just drop a bomb on them?  They weren't trying to capture them.  And they already had heavy weaponry, I don't think lack of availability would have been an issue.
 
Why did they have to get to the kids before the border?  They already attacked Logan's home in Mexico so clearly they have no qualms about crossing national borders.
 
Why did Logan stop drinking?  This one really bugged me.  They went out of their way to play him up as an alcoholic in the beginning and then just dropped it halfway through.  I'm guessing that it was due to him realizing he had a daughter but they just kind of glossed over it and I feel they missed a really important piece of character development.
 
Why didn't the kids just fight in ND?  Laura alone could kill like 20 guys at a time, why not just team up with the rest of the *highly trained killing machines* to fight back instead of running?
 
Why didn't Logan smoke any of the cigars he took from the gas station???  I was really looking forward to an iconic scene with Wolverine chomping on a stoagie getting geared up to gut some bad guys.  Obviously this has no bearing on the plot but it really drove me crazy that they missed such an easy slam dunk after they set it up so well.

Why didn't they harvest any of Charles' genetic material?  The wold's most powerful brain or a sun-burned mutant sniffer?  Ehh let's go with the bloodhound.  Especially when mutants don't exist anymore?  That made no sense.  On that note, why did they have a gymnasium full of dead mutant bodies?  Are they X-Men corpses from the Westchester incident.. a year ago?  Or just random mutants?  Or just completely random bodies?  In a high school gym?  That just made zero sense to me.
 
Why would Logan agree to stay over at the farmer's house?  The bad guys were like two hours behind them and he agrees to put the family in danger?  That was ridiculous.
 
Caliban was only in the movie to hunt them down later.  That just felt lazy, like there was absolutely zero other reason to have him in the movie.  He was a pretty weak character too.  I didn't like him very much.

So these may not count as plot holes, per se.  But there are clearly a bunch of oversights that just didn't add up for me.  ",5x7z96

And while most of the hints are small/subtle, i think the end where he refuses the money and sacrifices himself to save them is very clear even to a child.

I mean, she is a kid with combat training and some very useful mutations that likely enhance her reflexes as well, but I was expecting her to get hit at least a few times - it's not like it would kill her given her extremely strong healing factor (the little bit of adamantium in her claws/feet is unlikely to inhibit it much, and she's young, so it's probably like Wolverine's insane natural pre-adamantium healing factor on overdrive).

It was also odd how when they captured the runaways they didn't just shoot them immediately. Most of them presumably didn't have healing factors. And even for Laura, why wouldn't they have some sort of field-deployable method to kill her ready instead of just capturing her? From a brutally pragmatic stance, well, they were killing all of the kids off anyways after X-24 proved to be superior, they had no continued need for them and wanted them dead, so why the mercy? Why capture them instead of kill them? Heck, did they really shoot at the runaway kids much at all during the final chases in the woods? They were certainly quite happy to riddle Wolverine with bullets every chance they could get...

I prefer to try to integrate all of the movies whenever possible - they are technically the only established canon since comics are only semi-canon at best in the film universe.

deu6qbu,">Well I did says 'plausible and possible', not 'definitely happening right now this very second', and we do have GMO's and all sorts of biotech advancements in the pipeline I believe.

>Far-fetched? Maybe. But there's been an uproar in the past about companies such as Monsanto bio-engineering crops to force farmers to buy their product, so adding things to the food isn't exactly a total fantasy.

We've had commercialized transgenic crops in the US since 1994, although 1995 is the year that approvals of transgenic crops first exploded. Almost all of the soy, cotton, and corn grown in the US is genetically modified. The Hawaiian papaya industry was literally saved from extinction in 1998 thanks to genetically modified papaya varieties that were resistant to the papaya ring spot virus, which had been destroying the industry's papaya  trees at an alarming pace. The major variety used was called the ""Rainbow papaya"", and a less frequently used alternative variety was called ""SunUp papaya"". Today 80% of all Hawiian papaya are genetically modified varieties that are resistant to the papaya ring spot virus. There are numerous genetically modified variants of a plethora of crops, and globally, adoption of genetically engineered crops has been embraced at a rapid pace over the past few decades.

No biotech company has *ever* commercialized so-called ""genetic use restriction technology"" (GURT), also known as the ""terminator gene"" or ""terminator seeds"", which is what you're referring to by ""Monsanto bio-engineering crops to force farmers to buy their product"". This technology was developed by a company that Monsanto purchased at one point, but Monsanto has clearly and repeatedly stated that they have no plans to commercialize the technology (and no need for it). Why? Because every major commercial biotech company selling GM crops (Monsanto, Syngenta, Bayer, BASF, Dow, and DuPont being the largest) requires every purchaser of GM seed to agree to sign a technology usage agreement first, which primarily specifies that the farmer agrees not to reuse the grown crops for seed (i.e. each seed may be planted and harvested once, the product of the seed may not be replanted). This has been enforced via a relatively small number of lawsuits against the few farmers who decided to intentionally violate their agreements. The technology usage agreement is a standard agreement. There is nothing nefarious about it. GM seed caries these restrictions because of patent protection efforts. Not all GM seed requires a technology usage agreement - in particular, the genetically modified Hawaiian papaya that saved the domestic industry from extinction was produced and distributed for free by the University of Hawaii, with no agreements involved. Universities do quite a bit of biotech research, but they rarely have the funding and ability to bring the fruits of their research to market (which requires a long and extraordinarily expensive regulatory approval process that is very similar in terms of length, difficulty, and cost to the FDA drug approval process), which is why most GM varieties are commercialized by major biotech companies, although a number of notable exceptions exist, and in certain cases major biotech companies have granted unlimited-use exceptions for some of their patents, most notably with Golden Rice where Syngenta provided an unlimited license free of charge for the project's humanitarian purposes to a number of patented technologies belonging to Syngenta, Monsanto, Bayer, Orynova, and Zeneca Mogen.

You may think that it's odd to require farmers to purchase new seeds every year. It's a common misconception that farmers still save seed. This is no longer a widespread/common practice, and it's not because of GMOs - it's because of hybrid crops and a little problem called hybrid vigor. Hybrid crops were first introduced in 1924 and enjoyed an explosion in popularity since then thanks to their vastly superior genetics, which in turn caused a subsequent explosion in crop yields, especially so in combination with a number of other modern farming techniques that were being commercialized alongside hybrids. Hybrid crops are not genetically engineered - they are selectively crossbred for certain desirable traits. Hybrid seed is a F1 hybrid, and when planted, it will produce a crop with the optimal and uniform characteristics that it was designed for. However the offspring of this crop (any seed from the crop) is a F2 hybrid, and this is an impure offspring that does not retain the consistency and number of desirable traits of the F1 hybrid, and it introduces additional unwanted variation. For these reasons once hybrid crops became popular (they quickly dominated the market), farmers stopped saving seed - there was no point to saving it anymore, reusing it would only provide a whole lot of negatives that easily outweighed any money saved from reuse. So when GM crops came along with their technology usage agreements (something that was not entirely new, as these were not the first patented crops), the vast majority of farmers were quite fine with formally agreeing to continue doing what they'd been doing their entire lives in exchange for the substantial benefits available with genetically engineered traits. The ones that weren't okay with it were free to refuse to sign the contract. A few farmers signed the contract and attempted to reuse seed through various means, while a few others attempted to isolate and use seed via other means without signing a contract in the first place - and they were all sued for violation of contract and/or patent infringement.

Patenting crops sounds like a scary sinister thing to some people, but I've already noted that GM crops were not the first plants to be patented. In fact, it's been possible to patent plants in the US [since 1930](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_Patent_Act_of_1930), with the patent rights extended further to cover more plants in the [Plant Variety Protection Act of 1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_Variety_Protection_Act_of_1970). GM plants are a little different because there are often multiple patents involved and a slightly different patent type is usually used as one of the patent protections that, among other things, specifically allows for the restriction of seed reuse rather than merely restricting seed reuse to the licensee only (as is the case with the more traditional plant patent protection methods). As with all patents, patent protection is strictly limited in duration, and after 20 years (for US patents), the patent protection expires and the material protected under the patent enters the public domain.

The kind of effects caused by the fictional mutant suppressor food additive do not exist outside of a few especially nutty conspiracy theories about GM crops. Gene transfer from genetically engineered crops is a topic that has been studied, and it has been proven that it is not a concern due to the fact that our digestive tract destroys DNA and thus the hypothesized potential for gene transfer is impossible in anyone with a normal digestive tract (if you have an ileostomy than DNA is not completely destroyed and gene transfer can occur, but it is completely nonselective (i.e. gene transfer occurs indiscriminately from anything you eat), limited to a very specific set of intestinal bacteria, and has not been demonstrated to reoccur during attempts at replicating the only observed case (which did not occur during the course of the study but occurred prior to study initiation)). Any attempt at gene therapy with GM crops would be relatively pointless based on the current research - there are better possible vectors out there. I've speculated about some of them in this thread. Let's not loose track that we're talking about fiction here, and if we want to compare it to the real world, we must be careful to make realistic and informed comparisons. Genetically modified crops are not a useful vector in the way you describe, so it would be most logical to assume that the mutant suppressor was designed in an entirely different fashion. Perhaps it was a very special fictional chemical/protein/etc that magically turned off the mutant inheritance - that's something that could in theory be self-synthesized by genetically modified crops during growth, although it would likely be much easier to just produce the chemical/protein/whatever in a factory and dump it into the food supply chain manually - it's rather difficult to modify a crop to reliably synthesize useful quantities of *arbitrary* chemicals or proteins, far more so than it is to make the modifications used in modern genetically engineered crop traits.

From the way it was described on the radio, it was the size of the hotel incident. But we can also assume that it went on much longer -- nobody would have known what was happening, or have had a sedative close at hand. We can assume that everyone in the school was killed, and quite a number of ordinary people beyond. The X-Mansion was the base for the X-Men, and the X-Men collected exceptional mutants from around the world. When everyone at the Mansion was killed, it would have been an extraordinary blow to their kind.

2. Most mutants were barely mutants. In X3 Magneto meets with a convention of mutants. He writes most of them off as barely mutants at all -- no visible characteristics, and very limited powers. There were very few mutants on the same level as the X-men. When new mutants stopped being born, you might imagine that the stigma against them would return -- Logan wonders if they were ""God's mistake"". The mutant acceptance movement would have lost a lot of momentum. Minor mutants, who comprised the vast majority, would probably have tried simply to blend in with the rest of the population.

3. Mutants seem to have high attrition rates. Those that don't learn to use their powers often endanger themselves, and even those that do seemed drawn to dangerous situations. 22 years with no new births -- the population would have whittled itself down. You could imagine Magneto, for example, doing something dumb when he realised his race was dying out. And getting many mutants on both sides killed as a result.

4. Zander Rice was murdering and collecting the exceptional mutants that remained. When Caliban dies, they put him in a room with a great many other dead adult bodies. They start analysing his tissue for its unique traits. It seems Zander was collecting dead mutants to clone into his child-weapon program. It's Trask all over again, but with more authority, more power -- and an aging mutant population that is unable to mount a coordinated defence.

It does seem unlikely that mutants could disappear in 22 years, especially considering the size of the population as it's presented in X3. But most people involved in the franchise appear totally happy to ignore or rewrite X3 when it becomes inconvenient. And given the elements described above? I don't think it's implausible that you'd see mutants disappearing, both from the public eye and from the face of the world.",5x7z96
dege1ni,"There were 600 other victims in the Westchester incident. So it sounds like all the students were killed, along with the then-current X-men.",5x7z96
degd1er,"The movie alludes to it happening at the school so he probably killed everyone there and anyone nearby.

degawfe,"I wish they would've showed it,  like how they did in the comic.


I also was hoping the movie would follow the comic closer in how the xmen died,  with the twist on it being that charles makes wolverine kill the xmen (charles making logan think their intruders to the mansion) with charles being manipulated by Dr
Rice. Charles is then given the disease as a way to control him from having a violent out break, and logan tries to drink it away but can't.


I think it would've followed the comics story better and made for a better pay off/reveal when you witness the events unfold it's a huge payoff like in the comics. ",5x7z96

 When the story has a hero make a blatant declaration of some specific principle (""i don't like guns"" said by someone who has no big compunctions about killing, for instance), they are doing it to set expectations and establish how the stakes can rapidly increase. What's a recurring and central theme in superhero fiction is how the hero can maintain their principles in the face of crisis. 

 Logan using a gun after we see that his physical power is in a rapidly diminishing state demonstrates that he is desperate; a superhero that sacrifices their principles do so not out of choice. It is usually anathema to the core of this kind of genre fiction. In such a situation it is merely to demonstrate that he's running out of options. Why are his options running out? Because he's dying. He can't pull a superhero hat trick in this situation. A Logan in his prime would have figured something out without using a gun. But Logan is out of time and life. ",5x7z96

That was the end of that timeline.

The new timeline which branched off 1973 when Mystique sparred Trask, is the timeline where Apocalypse happened in the 1980s.

degaj6f,"Destroying or heavily damaging the brain at once is the best way to kill wolverine if you have the means of breaking adamantium (the slug Laura shot that wolverine carried was made of pure adamantium) Edit: both of their skulls are encased in adamantium.

Its fair to say that wolverine lost like 40% of his brain at one time. That much trauma at once is impossible to recover from. Especially since there are probably shards of his skull stuck in his brain. 

Wolverine in origins was shot in the head with an adamantium slug but at much farther range (like 80M i think) and it only damaged his part of the brain associated with memory. (that eventually healed around the bullet im not sure if it was ever removed or not.) 

At the range the girl was in (literally like 3 meters from the poor guy at most) and the angle it was shot the clones head just popped like a bloody balloon. If there was significantly less damage x-24 probably could have healed (as wolverine did when he was shot in the head with an adamantium bullet) but laura would probably have dug his brain out if she sensed life still honestly.

Movie wolverine is not like comic wolverine. Movie wolverine can suffer extreme amounts of trauma but the brain basically being destroyed will put him down no matter what. (hell if you erased logans entire torso in the movies chances are he would die because his healing factor isnt comic book level powerful. It can heal massive amounts of trauma quickly but it cant repair basically every major organ + 70% of his blood volume missing before he would naturally expire i imagine)

The only way to kill wolverine without adamantium is literally split between drowning him, Dropping a powerful bomb on his head capable of instantly destroying a massive amount of his body at once, or be raiden and literally decapitate him in the spaces between the Vertebra. (this isnt possible with movie wolverine IIRC as the adamantium coating in the movies is really messy and doesn't cover 100% of his skeleton).

In the comics there are more ridiculous ways to kill him but its basically the same. with the exception of that ""bomb"" has to be a nuke and he have no forewarning of it.

Super heroes are about real life. That's what Marvel has always been about. Mixing real life with heroes. X-men did it when it came to social issue and family and acceptance. Spider-man was about how life didn't always work out, and power comes with responsibility. Ect ect.

The point, which I guess you missed, of Logan was that *SPOILERS Logan died finding the Super Hero inside himself again. He died taking a stand protecting people that needed protecting. That's a pretty big deal for such a tortured character that we've lived with for over a decade.

On sleeping on it, I think it may simply have been that I just wanted to see more of the actual people, less of the action (though some of it was definitely earned) and actually liked it more than I initially thought.

I thought the scene with the family was really insightful, but outside of that they had few interactions with normal people - it would've been interesting to explore that a bit more.

If they had used the Reavers to harpoon Wolverine from different locations and start to pull him apart and the children saved him and then X-23 ran up to him as he is slowly dying...that would've been better.

My point is that in most post-apocalyptic media where the main character begrudgingly has to take a younger character he doesn't know to a certain place because of a really significant reason. Many of the story beats are the same because the story arcs all reach the same or a similar conclusion.

Eg the black family they meet is along the lines of, remembering what it's like to have friends and be normal, right before it's taken away from you and your thrown back into reality.

Prison Break was only for the 1st Season. If I could somehow specify that I would, I dont think its possible. I would defend a 9 for the 1st season only. Every season past that would be a huge drop.

Flash is corny as fuck and has cheesy acting, but I have enjoyed it. I dont think that's actually that high in quality objectively, it's a guilty pleasure. I would never defend that rating.

> Good God. Drop that shit fast.

All I remember as I came out of the theatre was: 

* That 3D was fucking amazing, the best 3D since Avatar. Maybe the best 3D special effects I've ever seen actually, huge props for that. I know for a fact once I rewatch it this aspect will go away and will drop a point just for that.
* The ending boss battle had some really cool little details and you could assume so many things the filmmaker might have wanted you to see. Seeing the character progress to that point compared to earlier in the movie was fantastic.
* I just generally enjoyed the hell out of the movie. I was laughing with the jokes, completely sucked in its world, cared for the characters, stunned by its visuals and it got me interested in more Dr Strange stuff.

I'll be rewatching it soon™ and taking a more objective/critical view on the film, but for the time being it's going to stay a 10 until I do. I don't think it's as good as my memory suggests.

I believe he was scared to tackle the responsibility due to people he loves always getting hurt. Xavier being the perfect example. It's why he has always been a loner, and has always left the mansion to be alone.

I'm stealing another dude's comment because he explained it so damn well.

To me, that means that before she met him, she was under the impression that her father was the Wolverine, this great hero who always helps people and stands for justice. Can you imagine her disappointment in meeting this drunk, grizzled old man with contempt for everything? She probably was incredibly let down, culminating in that amazing moment where Logan tells her that everything he cares about goes to shit and she says, ""I should be fine then."" Logan is too proud and grizzled to admit this and just decides to let her go until he sees that Pierce and Rice are after her. Yet again it appears that he has fallen short of saving the people around him and he is forced to spring into action. Finally he becomes the man that Laura always thought he was. Then he fucking dies. Up until that climax, he wasn't her daddy, until he rose to the occasion and then he is ripped away from her.

It seems we agree that X-3 was erased by DoFP. I still say that the general events taking place in The Wolverine could have happened since the catalyst for him going to Japan hasn't changed because of DoFP. He still saved a man from a nuclear blast during WW2, and in the early 2010's that man is still dying and remembers the POW who could heal himself. Just because Jean is alive I don't think it means they never tried recruiting Logan to visit Japan.

Clearly it was.  You demonstrated it.  You can't seem to understand the character's motivations, then base your complaints on your own misunderstanding.  That's not even a matter of opinion, it's a plain and obvious scene, and you manage to completely misinterpret it.  End of story.",5x7z96

Like the scene in the casino where she sees the father/daughter mannequins holding hands and later when she tries to hold his hand the same way. Even her speech over his grave at the end was nothing more than the speech from the end of Shane; she still had no idea how to verbalize her feelings, she probably didn't even understand them. I thought  the end wasn't so much about a sudden bond that had formed between them but more about two broken people finding a tiny little speck of something other than rage and misery.

Yes there may have been room for improvement, but I think many of the flaws would not improve the movie if they were gone - it'd even ruin the plot to fix some of them. Hence while there were numerous flaws, it doesn't mean that the movie wasn't good.

I mean, we got an R-rated X-Men movie with a great budget and a good to great plot (in broad terms) that is overall an amazing send-off for Wolverine. Lots of action, lots of emotion, and some thought-provoking themes/ideas. Plus a bunch of new X-Men movie series canon reflecting the new timeline.

I've read most of the X-Men comics featuring Laura since posting my original comments in this thread and I feel like the movie did a good job with her character, although some of her personal conflicts didn't get covered well and they obviously modified things quite a bit. While the film isn't perfect, again, it's 9/10 if not higher for me. You don't usually get perfection in any story, especially so with film/TV, and you can't fairly judge it directly against books/comics or idealized depictions of what the movie ""should"" be like.

Spare parts? They bred their own test subjects. Genetic code? They had everyone's genetic code. And they had the DNA for the mutant characteristics too (which they used for the kids). Reprogrammed is the only possible answer but they would have been better off starting from scratch with a new method then trying to work on the same kids again. They literally grew X24 in a tank. No reason why they wouldnt try growing the kids from scratch the next time around, rather than breeding/raising them like before, or trying to get the same ones to comply.

The years of X-men movies is what that impact is built on and Logan uses its history masterfully.  But I don't know if it earned it.  It sure didn't really earn the ""Daddy"" line.  What it earned was everything Jackman and Stewart gave to that script.  Those two nearly single-handedly made that movie feel depressing and sad.  But the kid felt like they got the minimum of interaction needed to ""earn"" the death scene.  To compare it to the story I think does it better.  Its like if The Last of Us Skipped the whole Ellie saving Joel and killing the cannibal and expected us to get the desperation Joel feels in the end of the game.  

The emotional impact that this movie alone built (AKA everything with the kid and nothing to do with the past) just doesn't hit as hard as it should've.  What does hit hard is watching Stewart who was so commanding as Xavier for years fall apart.  Jackman destroying himself and wearing his exhaustion and pain on his sleeve is powerful.  Wolverine giving everything for one last shot at saving someone he cares about is powerful.  But its not him saving the kid its that he failed over and over and over in every movie that Jackman has played the role is why its so powerful.

How about instead of having the final fight be between Logan and himself (both metaphorically and literally), it's between man and him, like it always has been. You don't need a super villain type character, or something for Wolverine to stab.  The film is also filled with tons of cliche plot points, now being cliche doesn't make them bad, but  when you are dealing with the Old Gruff Father figure has to find redemption in a daughter figure, you HAVE to do something completely different.

Prof X was growing old and from the outside it would make sense that someone with insane telepathic abilities might lose control of them through either old age or an advanced disease such as Alzheimers where he would forget and maybe start to seize. That might be hypothetical but from the movie where he is said to have most likely killed some people accidentally, I dont think its too much of a stretch. I am convinced that it is adamantium poisoning, which is almost stated in the film.

I dont think that its just some coincidence that just ~3 or ~10 (I don't exactly remember the time frame) years later Wolverine is degrading due to the fact that he wasn't refitted with adamantium until around 2001 in the movie universe. It's not another leap to think that he's suffering from something different than the professor.

The hero arrives at their goal, having completed their task, and now wishes to go his own way. It was painfully obvious that he would have a change of heart when he saw his companions in danger. 

How could Logan have impressed me? The line that got me from the trailer was 'Logan, what have you done?"" spoken by Charles. I really felt that the movie was going to be a moral examination of Logan, and that perhaps as the pressures of the dystopian world around him closed in he would lost his moral restraint and commit a horrible act. Perhaps instead of dying in the end his conclusion to his story would be either to find atonement or to live with what he had done. As I am writing this, I find it bears resemblance to the character Jackman played in Prisoners: a movie that defied story conventions by examining human morality. I was hoping that with the smaller budget, Logan could have been much more experimental in its storytelling rather than rehashing a kinda stale version of the Hero's Journey.

Genetically modified maize (corn) is a genetically modified crop. Specific maize strains have been genetically engineered to express agriculturally-desirable traits, including resistance to pests and to herbicides. Maize strains with both traits are now in use in multiple countries. GM maize has also caused controversy with respect to possible health effects, impact on other insects and impact on other plants via gene flow.

Tell me this: why the hell would they be putting those kids into cold storage at the beginning of the movie if they didn't have any use for them?

We can have this discussion all we want about how ignorant it is for OP to not know what language they speak in mexico and make fun of him for thinking it is called ""mexican"" but until we know where OP is from it is all moot.   Given the things we do know there is a good chance OP is from an english speaking country in the western hemisphere and if that is the case they should probably know that they speak spanish in Mexico...and basically the entire central american region. So until OP fesses up and tells us where he is from this is all hypothetical, but like I said, the evidence points more towards OP being an uninformed english speaking north american rather than an english speaking Kazakhstani who, to be fair, probably doesn't need to know shit about Mexico.

He has done several things to malign and discriminate against legal immigrants, even before we get to to the idea that his making some people illegal immigrants is itself discrimination.

This is why Trump *says* he is doing it, but as I said, that does not explain the total lack of movement towards a more nuanced, case-by-case system that we can both agree is the best solution. All the defeat of the first immigration block did was cause him to chastise the judiciary.

Germany's issues are not great, but among the few that have come from the most recent wave of immigration, whilst the rest of Europe also takes immigrants without much incident. Beside that, Gemany has taken several waves of immigration happily.

A higher rate of immigrants are on welfare due to that including asylum seekers. Immigrants immediately going on welfare is not great, but the problem is grossly exaggerated, monetarily insignificant and does at least protect the 'American jobs' that Trump is rallying support towards.",5x7z96
