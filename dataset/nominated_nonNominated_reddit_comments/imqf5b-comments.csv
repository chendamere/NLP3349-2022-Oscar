g45j5v9,"Not having read any other comments, my wife and I came up with the interpretation that the whole movie is the wandering mind of the janitor while he cleans the school. There's definitely a lot being said, but the structure of the movie falls into place. He still lives at home and takes care of his elderly parents. His thermos is at the front door. His work clothes are in the laundry. 

He's imagining or remembering past girlfriends as an idealized woman who is a painter, poet, biologist, physicist. The paintings and poems are all from his house. Her name always changes. He knows all her references, she knows none of his. These relationships always fail. At one point after he is done watching the movie at work, she is replaced by the actress. However these relationships are never comfortable and never work out. 

He was a diligent young man, but never had the acumen to get away from the brutal, lonely life on the farm. Every day he stops at the ice cream place, where the girls in high school make fun of him, to bet a Brr and throws it in the trash when he gets to work. He imagines a dance number, accepts the Nobel prize while sweeping the stage, then sings a beautiful show number. 

He thinks of committing suicide from hypothermia in his car, but then comes back after sleeping in the school and starts up his car to go home and start it all over again.",imqf5b

It's times like this that I appreciate how out of my element I am as a movie fan or even an art appreciator. I'm reminded that I'm just a random pleb who watches a couple more movies than the average person, not a true film connoisseur or cinephile.

Spoilers ahead:

I never read the book, so I have no other context other than the movie, but I think it became clear towards the end that that everything outside of the some of the scenes with the Janitor are the complete fantasy of the Janitor himself, who is in fact Jake at an older age. Apologies if this is obvious to most people.

The Janitor's life is shown in a few quick snapshots. We see that he is aged. We see that he lives alone. We see that he works as a janitor at a High School where the students don't respect him, make fun of him, or are creeped out by him. He is not living a satisfying life, and as his life approaches its end, it becomes clear to him that there is little he can do change things.

Instead of trying to change things, he does what he has probably done for most of his life, which is to use fantasy to try to construct a potentially better life. It is hinted at in dialogue that Jake/the Janitor has probably been lonely and socially awkward for most of their life. His mother says that he never had many friends in childhood or adulthood, and it seems clear that he is not comfortable around people.

This brings us to his fixation on the Young Woman, sometimes called Lucy or Louisa or Lucille. I think that a portion of the story that she tells about their first meeting at the dinner table is accurate. It is likely that Jake did go to a a trivia night and did see the young woman and maybe even exchanged a few words with her. I doubt there was anything beyond this, but it was enough to begin a fixation within Jake. He probably first admonished himself for not asking for her number. This grew into something more and at some point in his life, he began to think of this moment as the last time he could have done something in order to have a happy life. If he had just asked for her number, or if she had asked for his, everything could be different.

Everything we see of the Young Woman and Jake's relationship in the movie is Jake creating elaborate fantasies about how the relationship could have worked out. This accounts the various changes in the Young Woman's character throughout the movie. He always fantasizes that she is intelligent and creative. Sometimes this means that she is a poet, sometimes a painter, sometimes a physicist, but she is always idealized in some way. In a monologue near the end, the Young Woman addresses this. In the fantasy Jake is always smarter than he is, and the Young Woman is always perfect, not necessarily because he wants her to be perfect, but because he wants her to be respected, which in turn would bestow respect on him, something he dearly desires.

It also accounts for the name changes. He never actually got the Young Woman's name so it changes throughout the movie and as his fantasy develops. It also indicates how little Jake actually knows about the woman he has constructed his fantasies around. She is a complete blank slate that any characteristics can be applied to.

I think it's interesting that even deep within Jake's fantasies, the relationship is still imperfect. He imagines fights and even that the Young Woman may not want to be in a relationship with him at all. This is likely the insecurities, depression, and anxiety that have plagued Jake for all of his life coming through in his fantasies. He is a person who feels unworthy of other people's love and affection, and it is likely these feelings that have stunted all of his relationships throughout his life. Even attempting to create a fantasy in which he is happy is difficult for him to do.

Throughout the movie the phrase ""I'm thinking of ending things"" is thought by the Young Woman in reference to their relationship. At the end this takes on a new meaning, of Jake/the Janitor ending their life. I think it is very likely that he does in fact do this at the end of the movie, ending his unhappiness and regrets.

What I'm less certain about is what the overall theme of the movie is. It could be about missed opportunities, but I think that's too simple. There is no indication that had Jake actually asked for the Young Woman's number that his life would have been any different, or that he would have somehow been saved from a life of unhappiness.

I think more generally it is about allowing depression and anxiety to take control of your life, which in turn makes life unfulfilling and full of regret.

This is a deeply sad movie and the Janitor is a truly tragic figure. Unfortunately I think there are far more people like the Janitor than we realize. People who suffer inside of their own heads day in and day out while never letting anybody else in.",imqf5b
g42lp0e,"Imagine being the unnamed girl from Jake’s fantasy.

g42dwyo,This was by far a movie.,imqf5b
g4mdk39,"This really hit me hard. I'm not sure if what I'll describe below was the precise intention of the movie, but the film reminds me of how I used to exist in the world when I was younger. Getting over this type of thinking was basically the most important feature of becoming an adult for me, as well as escaping from frequent anxiety I felt when I was younger.

Up until around my early/mid-20s, I basically performed my life for an imagined audience. I didn't think of it in this way until I started recognizing it and trying to force myself to stop doing it so much. It sounds cheesy, but I had to force myself to ""live for myself"" in order to stop being anxious all the time and feel comfortable enough to pursue what I wanted to do in life. The first time I noticed it was when I studied abroad in Argentina in college, and I was going to fly from Buenos Aires to Ushuaia (southern tip) and backpack toward BA for two weeks with my roommate from the US. My roommate canceled last minute, so I had to decide whether I would fly to Ushuaia alone or also cancel. I couldn't explain to him why I was so anxious to go alone. After a few days of backpacking alone and feeling very eerily ""alone for the first time ever"", I kept noticing that I was behaving as if people I knew were watching me, even though, I literally knew zero people for 1,000 miles in any direction. It was the first time I was not with someone I knew for more than a day or two, and I was surprised that I was still inventing or imagining the people in my life to watch me in order to judge whether my actions were worthwhile or not. It's not like I literally imagined them, but I non-linguistically sort of guessed what ""my people"" would think about everything I did or thought. Actually being alone gave me a lot of anxiety at first, because I kept feeling like ""what the hell am I doing?"". But after a while I realized that the source of that feeling was stemming from my interpretation of my life through an imagined ""my people"". I didn't notice it until I was actually alone and could separate actual people from this imagined version that I used to harshly judge myself. I think doing this is inherently human, and nobody gets over it all the way. But I did it way too much, and the shock of being totally alone at the southern tip of Argentina was what allowed me to identify it and start to work it out of my system over the following years.  


This process of imagining some observer in order to interpret oneself to judge oneself is how I understood the film until I read some articles after. The ""my people"" I passively imagined were a sort of ""normal people soup"" that my brain came up with from popular or likable classmates (especially women), as well as characters from books and movies. I felt like the young woman was basically an imagined person that the young man was using to assess his life in order to determine whether he should kill himself. I recognized the negative self-judgement through the imagined eyes of others as something I did to a great degree when I was younger. I think if I hadn't started working on it I might have ended up being an unhappy person like the main character.  


(I apologize if this comes off as a humble brag that I traveled in Argentina. I imagine the realization could come without access to privileged and bourgie experiences, but that's how it happened for me. I hope this post might help someone who needs to do so come to the realization I came to, actually.)",imqf5b

g47nxbt,Hi I have a few questions first of all what the fuck,imqf5b
g42c873,"

To me, the book and also the movie are about lost chances. 

He lost the chance of talking to the “Young Woman”. 
He lost the chance to be a teacher and eventually became the janitor and stayed in that job, well, obviously until very old. 
It seems to me that he also lost the opportunity to see his parents getting old and also lost the chance of supporting them when they needed him. That’s speculation, because it’s not really implied, maybe just a little when he’s in his truck and remembers very briefly a scene with his parents. 

I don’t think he has a disorder per se. It seems to me that he’s just really lonely and everything happened in his head. That makes everything only worst and very, very, very depressing.",imqf5b
g424gxn,I watched Tenet the other day and actually understood the plot so I was feeling pretty smart. Then I watched this and remembered I'm a fucking idiot. I still really liked it though.,imqf5b
g431gvt,"I found this movie to be incredibly sad and heartbreaking. It’s basically an old man both reflecting on his life but also bombarding his own thoughts with a made up fantasy. Jake is a sad, lonely janitor with nothing going for him and no one in his life. Everything happening in the movie is just him creating this fantasy life with a woman to help cope with himself. She’s the only thing keeping him alive, and her reflections on their relationship is basically his own self-reflections on his life. Shes starting to not see any reason to stay with him, and that’s basically just Jake not seeing any reason to continue living. The scene close to the end with the girl speaking to the janitor about how she didn’t remember the guy from the bar and how he was basically just a mosquito was Jake throwing out his last shred of self-worth. When she hugged him and left, he was recognizing her for what she was, a fantasy. The only thing that was left was to end things (his own life).


The saddest scene in my opinion was the janitor sitting there alone watching that lame romantic film, because it’s basically just fuel for his continued fantasies, hence the actress in the fake movie briefly replacing Jessie’s character in one scene. To anyone who’s been in a real relationship, that film clip came off as corny and dumb, but to Jake it’s something he admired and craved (hence the actresses appearance in his own fantasy). I kind of compare that to how certain people interpret “500 Days of Summer” *very* differently.


I also think that whole scene with the father talking to the woman about paintings and how literal he needs them to be was Kaufman taking the piss out of the audience.",imqf5b
g43sh1o,"I really hated all the changes they made from the book. 

They made the protagonist one of the many oddities in the movie instead of the book which made her a normal character reacting normally to all this strange shit going on around her. We think she’s a real person and that this is really happening, in this film it’s pretty clear halfway through that this is either some warped dream world, or that she’s not real. We the audience cannot relate to her or feel scared for her in the film, as she’s just another piece of symbolism. She was the only normal person in the book, and thus she acted as a conduit for us into this strange world, because she felt like a genuine person. 

They sort of abandoned the slow build up of pure dread the book gave you. In fact, they basically took most if not all of the scary parts out. The phone calls she receives are a big deal in the book and scary as fuck. The girl at the ice cream stand with the rash is creepier because you believe her when she says they’re in danger, you have no idea this woman is just a piece of symbolism, you think she’s an actual person actually living this. In the book when they’re in the car and he sees someone watching them, it’s really fucking creepy and unsettling, because these felt like real people in the real world who were in danger. Knowing that it’s all symbolic and not real halfway through just abandoned that sense of dread and fear the book built. It’s pretty clear he had no interest in adapting the scary sections, which is depressing because they’re SO creepy in the book. 

Up until the very last pages in the book are you convinced that all of this is really happening, in the movie you sort of realize halfway through that it’s all mostly imagery and symbolism, and that most if not all of it isn’t actually happening. I have no idea why Kaufman sort of gave up halfway through in trying to convince the audience that this is all real, and sort of just shrugs and says ‘yeah, it’s all symbolic and/or not happening the way it looks’, as evident when Jesse Buckley sees her poem in one of the books in the house and sees the parents aging 30 years within segments and shrugs it off like it’s nothing. It makes her less relatable and makes the situation less creepy when they’re basically telling you she’s not a real person from the start. As someone else here said, it loses all sense of stakes and danger. 

It’s clear Charlie Kaufman didn’t want to make something that was scary or dread inducing and instead wanted to make something more strange and symbolic. Which is fine, I’d just probably like it better if it was closer to the book in that regard. Maybe if I hadn’t read the book and expected the same horror and dread I’d have liked the movie more. It’s not terrible just not great imo",imqf5b

g4hjkyt,"A few days late watching it, but my girlfriend and I just finished it and here's our take. Neither of us have read the book. 

We got the vibe that he's a sad, lonely, creepy old man, and the events in the film were in his mind while he sits in his truck poisoning himself via the fumes from his exhaust. The fantasy changes time period a lot, and her name and job change too, likely because of the fumes. Smell is mentioned twice (the dog and the varnish). And what solidified this for us were the voice messages she received from him, not lucid, in his truck. He's calling a girl who timidly gave him her number because she doesn't know how to say no. 

Unrelated to the above, but I also noticed that he told his dad that he had snow chains in ""the bed"", but he drove there in a car. However the janitor had a truck, presumably with chains in the bed.",imqf5b

I don't think it was bad, all the performances were good, visuals were beautiful, and I loved the theme of time and how it washes through people. I think I would've liked it more had I been more interested in trying to figure it all out from the get-go, but I did find myself pretty bored for most of it once I realized this was just gonna stay pretty bizarre throughout. 

I like the idea that the woman is just imagined by Jake and he's just placing her in different situations in his life like a science experiment, imagining how his parents would act, what they would talk about on the drive, etc. Explains her clothes and what she's studying changing constantly, as well as how he can seemingly read her thoughts and always conveniently interrupts her as she's about to say ""I'm thinking of ending things."". As it all goes wild in the end, it's as if his idealization is crashing down on itself as he follows it to its logical conclusion. Does that make any sense or am I just being deliberately obtuse? I don't know.

I'm not a huge film buff, and the only other movie of Kaufman's that I've seen is Being John Malkovich (which I loved), so I just felt pretty outta my depth watching this. I think this is one of those movies where my opinion reflects more on me than the quality of the movie itself, just not my thing. Honestly as I was writing this I realized that this movie is more fun to think about than to actually watch, imho.",imqf5b
g4604ga,"I just watched it. I liked it a lot. 

I felt that Kaufman’s spin on the book was making Jake a lonely old man who has defined his entire life by the media he has consumed while living a very lonely, meaningless existence. 

We see Jake at work, lonely, watching a movie. He even imagines his own death as an adaptation of a Beautiful Mind and Oklahoma. He has spent his life consuming media and trivial knowledge, and his dream partner was someone with varied expertises capable of discussing these areas with him. I don’t think it’s a coincidence they “met” at a trivia night, and Jake’s mom even emphasized Jake’s mastery of trivial knowledge. But he himself has not made much of himself. His art is hidden in the basement as his only creation, and he’s ashamed of it. 

I feel like this movie had a lot to say about critical analysis and the vapidness of defining your own existence by the works of others without experiencing life yourself. It’s a very lonely existence. Multiple discussions in the movie were about consumption of media being like a “virus,” and the essay referenced by DFW in the movie has a similar theme. I could be missing the mark here, but I felt there was a strong theme about the isolating nature of media consumption here.",imqf5b

g430l5u,"Chiming in about the references to Oklahoma the musical, for those who aren’t familiar. Spoiler alert. I’ve read the book so some of this might not make sense if you’ve only seen the film.

You may want to do a quick review of the [Oklahoma Wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma!_(1955_film)) if you’re unfamiliar.

The song that plays on the car radio in the beginning scenes is [Many a New Day](https://genius.com/Richard-rodgers-many-a-new-day-lyrics), sung by the main female protagonist Laurey. It’s a song about unrequited love - Laurey has been falling for the male protagonist Curly, but catches herself when she sees him flirting with another woman. She tells herself she doesn’t need him, there are other fish in the sea, but it’s kind of obvious that she still has feelings for him. (One of the other fish in the sea is Jud, a farmhand who’s interested in Laurey. Laurey doesn’t reciprocate Jud’s feelings - he’s a bit obsessed with her and is portrayed as lowly, dirty, and immoral. Jud asks Laurey to go to a dance with him and Laurey agrees, mostly to be polite but also to spite Curly. More on this later.)

In later scenes in the film, the play being rehearsed while the janitor is cleaning the auditorium is Oklahoma - same for the two dancers practicing in the hallway as the janitor walks by. 

Now for the ballet: when the girlfriend finally finds Jake in the hallway in the school, their doubles walk into the scene and begin the ballet. This scene is a replica of the [Dream Ballet](https://youtu.be/2D1loAVwiMc) sequence in Oklahoma. It’s a really dark scene, especially for a musical. The dry farm atmosphere in the musical’s ballet contrasts really nicely with the snow falling in the gym in the film. If you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend watching that clip - it’s eerie how closely they replicated the choreography in the film. Even the veil falling down on the girlfriend’s head. 

In the ballet in the musical, Laurey dreams about marrying Curly, but Jud arrives and disrupts the wedding. Jud ends up killing Curly, and he stalks off with Laurey thrown over his shoulders - i.e. an extremely possessive gesture. (As many have commented, there are many other references to men possessing women/women as property of men throughout this film. The argument about Baby It’s Cold Outside, for instance.)

In the film, the girlfriend‘a doppelgänger/dancer is Laurey (the heroine), dancer Jake=Curly (the hero) and dancer janitor=Jud (villain). The ballet scene (kind of?) acts as a supplement for the final scenes in the book. /// Spoiler alert for the book /// Dancer janitor kills dancer Jake, and if the janitor is interpreted to be an older version (or alter ego) of Jake, this scene essentially shows Jake killing himself. 

Then the final scene of the film shows Jake singing [Lonely Room](https://genius.com/Richard-rodgers-lonely-room-lyrics) from the staged musical. The lyrics here are pretty clearly interpreted, but there’s one additional song from the musical (not mentioned in this film) that is interesting to look at through the lens of the film. 

It’s a song called Poor Jud is Dead ([clip from the 1955 film](https://youtu.be/Euq8Z4l6Iwk), and [lyrics if you just want to read them](https://genius.com/Richard-rodgers-pore-jud-is-daid-lyrics)). It’s a pretty messed up message- basically Curly tried to talk Jud into killing himself - under the guise of “I’ll show them / they’ll all be sorry when I’m dead.” As soon as I saw the ballet scene in the film, I immediately thought of this song. If we continue on with the film’s insinuation and view Curly as Jake and Jud as the janitor, it’s basically an off-camera allusion to Jake trying to convince himself to kill himself (“what are you waiting for?”)

(The musical ends with Curly killing Jud to protect Laurey, and to assert male dominance/stake claim to his wife i.e. property. The film adheres to the bizzaro world ending of the dream ballet rather than the actual end of the musical.)

It’s actually a pretty brilliant connection Kaufman has made. I hope some of this made sense - I figured much of this would be lost on those who aren’t familiar with the musical.",imqf5b

gpfc4ly,"Throughout the entire movie, there was this one thought niggling at me. Usually in a movie that’s a thriller or psychological horror, there is always the voice of reason. There is always something bizarre and unsettling happening, but there is always a character(s) who voices and acts as the person the viewer relates to. In ‘Get Out’ it was Kaluya’s character who knows from the beginning that there’s something unsettling about it all. In ‘Midsommar’, Pugh’s character is thoroughly freaked out initially.

But in this movie, ‘Lucy’ seemed to be just as complicit in the weirdness of the narrative as the rest of them; Jake, his parents, etc. You can tell that she’s nervous, but she’s never entirely surprised. Even when the mother gets nervous ticks during their dinnertime conversation, even when the old version of his father hands her a nightgown with a stain on it, even when she sees her supposed paintings on the wall in the basement. She’s low-key weirded out, but never stunned or shocked. 

Then I realised that this all comes from inside a single head. She _is_ complicit in the weirdness of her narrative.

Also, Jake’s mother seemed like someone who neglected and constantly mocked him for his low intelligence, who he gets back at, in his fantasy in which she obsessively makes comments about what a ‘good boy’ Jake is and about his diligence pin. In the fantasy, she’s the stupid, neurotic one, who cannot tell the difference between _genus_ and _genius_.",imqf5b
g425por,"Im bad at reddit and don’t know how to mark spoilers on mobile so here’s my *SPOILER WARNING* for the movie AND the book. I’m having a really hard time separating the film from the book and wish I was able to momentarily erase my memory of the book so I could experience the film with no preconceived expectations. I overall did like the movie, in fact, I thought Kaufman was really nailing the tone up until the school. I was fully ready for him to go into the dread inducing horror of the book, the girlfriend being stalked by the janitor, finding clues of Jake’s disappearance and slowly working up to the suicidal revelation that everything happening in the story thus far is in Jake’s mind, including the murder (which is actually suicide). It was my favorite part of the book probably. What we got instead was an interpretive dance sequence. It just didn’t work for me. I’m going to copy something I posted in a different thread here, and would love to have a discussion with both book readers and non book readers.



It felt like from there Kaufman kinda shyed away from going as horror as the book does. From my understanding, the interpretative dance scene is Jake/Janitor playing out in his head what would have happened (essentially what does happen in the book?) their courtship, marriage, and eventual death at his own hands (janitor stabbing Jake in the dance) But then, does the janitor go out to his car and die from hypothermia? Everything after that with the pig is him on his way to the afterlife, with the stage performance by Jake being him reflecting on his life and all the players in it before finally passing on.

The big tip off she wasn't real for me was that she never knew anything he didn't- he was always able to pick up and add to her references.

I'm not saying meanings aren't there and you can't interpret things, but I think it's important to watch these types of movies more emotionally or viscerally and not worry about ""getting it"" because if you're doing that you can't slow down and might actually miss the ride.  If you chill and allow your subconscious to connect I think you'll find you 'get it' in the moment and its not trying to be crazy intellectual.

The experience is in the pacing, the anxiety, the confusion, losing your direction and fighting to stay on track, boredom, seeing horror in something that's supposed to be 'normal', having strange conversations where you can't believe what an asshole you sound like, weird ticks, fearing and wondering what's beneath the surface of the people around you, nostalgia for the past, fear of the future and of death, feeling worthless and wanting approval, feeling like your best days are gone, its all part of the unedited human experience that I think Kauffman is more interested in capturing here than a hard narrative.",imqf5b
g69a70a,"I really loved this movie.  
The way they represent the internal dialog/fantasies this ordinary man creates to avoid contemplating (or finally commit) suicide is heart breaking. Love how the quirk and close to nonsense dialog and behavior at the beginning becomes so dark and charge with emotion at the end (let alone after a second view). Same goes to the performances.

The final moments of the film where his fantasies turn into delirium due to the hypothermia, and he has this hallucination with the pig, which tell him that basically he got to be one them, one of those who die and lived alone with no one aware of his suffering, just like the pigs eaten alive by maggots due to abandon... Man, if that isn't an existential tragedy!

Charlie Kaufmann is such an original and genuine writer. Those doubts, fears and fantasies are so elemental and universal (at the end, must of us are going to be one of the pigs). The representation of this struggle, of the fantasies we create to ourselves in order to accept our existence is devastating. 

In the final frame of the movie they let us answer the aforementioned question: how a painting  can be sad with nobody looking sad in it? Well, like the young woman said at one point: it is sad if you imagine yourself in it. Genius.

My friends were watching this through Netflix Party together (2 Psych PhDs, 1 Speech Pathology, 1 Film Editor, 1 Engineer) and we all had no idea wtf was going on! *We felt high even though we weren’t* and had to watch a YouTube video explaining to us what the hell we just watched for the past 2+ hours...

Our theories were 1) she had dissociative identity disorder and each person was a manifestation of her personalities 2) she was kidnapped and grew up in that basement and that’s why her memories are off and her picture is on the wall 3) there was some crazy time traveling plot like Donnie Darko 4) Jake and Lucy were the same entity... but we didn’t understand how her interactions with his parents seemed real like meeting them for the first time if she didn’t exist, why Jake flinched every time his mom tried to touch him, why the unnecessary zoom on his dad’s gross ass toes, why the dog shook uncannily, why the girl in the ice cream place had blood on her arm (which apparently was a frostbite rash??), and why the movie busted out into a theatrical musical towards the end... and how the janitor/woman in the diner (aka Ashley from The Boys) came into play as she was flashed as Lucy a few times.

g42tjfn,"First Kaufman movie I didn't love. Was on board after the wonderfully surreal dinner scene, but after that it went off the deep end and seemed to be trying to be as incomprehensible as possible. I went from thinking ""I can't wait to see how this all fits together"" to ""I'm pretty sure there's no way this will all fit together"", and at that point I started to lose patience with it. Sure enough, there's no real resolution and you're just left with a bunch of scattered puzzle pieces and not much incentive to try and put them together.

I love Being John Malkovich and Synecdoche because there's a narrative throughline with all the weirdness. You get a plot you can follow plus a bunch of oddball philosophical themes to chew on later. This movie just felt designed to keep you completely off-balance for the whole thing. 

I've read some of the theories and how the book ends, and I'm sure there's some profound stuff in there but by the end I'd just lost interest. That's the cost of making something more confusing than intriguing, I guess.

Will definitely give it the benefit of the doubt and rewatch though.",imqf5b

g53ujty,"This is going to be a long but thorough analysis of some of the scenes in the movie, during my second rewatch. I've tried to avoid or skim over things that have been already mentioned in a lot of your posts to avoid repetition. If you can make it till the end, please comment and let me know your thoughts. 

Part 1:

- Lucy was thinking about wanting to meet Jake's parents to know his origins because ""the child is the father of the man"". Jake interrupts her thoughts, as if they are his own, to refer to a poem by Wordsworth that - upon Googling and reading the poem - begins with that same line: ""the child is the father of the man"". 
Jake then goes on to say that this poem means a lot to him but doesn't get a chance to say why. The poem itself talks about seeing things as beautiful, magical, imbued with a ""celestial light"" when we are young, and then grow disillusioned and lose sight of that light as we get older. This reflects on how Jake felt hopeful in the past and how he feels now as an old janitor.

- Jake also says says that Wordsworth has written a series of poems to a woman named Lucy, described as ""ideal"". He then goes on to add that she resembles HIS Lucy, not only by having the same name, but by being ""ideal"" too. Lucy laughs at the compliment but this dialogue forebodes the rest: Lucy is an imaginary girlfriend that Jake has conjured up, perhaps an amalgamation of different women, an ideal creation of his mind.

- In the janitor's house, which seems to be the parents' old house (?), we have a brief cut of a swing set in his backyard. That same swing set appears in front of an abandoned house during Lucy and Jake's drive. Lucy sees the swing set and comments on it. Jake says he didn't see it. Maybe Jake is blinding himself from things that remind him of his lonely childhood (an empty house with an empty swing set, devoid of fun and warmth) and current loneliness. 

- Are the phone calls Lucy gets an attempt at snapping Jake out of his fantasy? We learn later on that it's Janitor Jake on the other end, expressing his fear and repeating that there is only ""one question to answer"". Maybe the question is: ""Do I want to die?"". Those phone calls are avoided many times; it's Jake putting off having to answer that question. 

- Lucy and Jake often interrupt each other and seem to know what the other is going to say before they've finished saying it. That's because Lucy and Jake are the same person and we are merely watching his stream of consciousness, with overlaps. Jake already knows the dialogue: he's the one creating it.

- The two high-school girls (later seen as the mean girls in the ice cream shop) laugh at Janitor Jake and how he walks. Right after, we see Lucy looking at a spot on the corner of Jake's mouth. His self consciousness makes its way into his fantasy due to his encounter with the two girls and he wipes the corner of his mouth and tries to hide it, worried that Lucy was scrutinizing him or judging him. 

- Jake has ""Oklahoma!"" on the radio because that's the play the students were rehearsing at the school. Same happens when he watches a movie and Lucy morphs into the heroine of that movie for a few moments.

- Lucy's recited poem in the car is about loneliness and aging. Jake says: ""it's like you wrote it about me"". We later see that poem in a book in Jake's house. That poem is resurfacing in his fantasy because it resonated in him when he first read it and because he is now contemplating suicide and so remembered it. Maybe he wishes that he was the one who wrote that poem. 

- The basement is mentioned often in the movie. We later discover that it's where Jake has hidden the paintings he's made when he was younger - because he's ashamed of them maybe, because they represent his broken dreams and failures. We notice that Lucy's paintings are there too but signed by another artist. In comparison, Jake's paintings seem small and bleak; he's painted the same scene over and over again. Maybe trying to get it exactly right, maybe because he felt stunted and didn't have anything else to paint. He imagines Lucy to have been a more talented painter than he was (and yet his parents don't seem to be impressed). It's a contrast of how Jake felt like he worked hard but couldn't get very far because he didn't have a lot of ""natural talent"".

- Jake jokes about the basement being scary and says ""He's hiding in there"" ==> He is himself, hiding his dreams, his failures, his shame.. We also learn that he is washing his janitor costumes down there as well.

- Jake's young mother is painted by Jake as being someone who doesn't respect Jake's privacy and who thinks of him as being a controlling child. She's the one who pushes Lucy to go into the basement to wash the nightgown; a place that Jake wanted to keep locked away.

- ""Even ideas want to live. They grow in your brain, replacing real ideas"". ""Like a Virus"" ==> this is what Jake is basically doing, living through his fantasies because his real life is too empty.

- Jake calls his parents for ages when he first arrives home and they make him wait for a prolonged time before coming downstairs. This hints about how empty the house felt for Jake, how his parents were so emotionally unavailable. A lot of signs point to that emotional unavailability throughout the movie such as the pig infested with maggots that was left to die in the barn or the food spread that no one eats.

- Jake's attitude towards his parents changes as they age. From hostile and standoffish, he turns nurturing when his parents both fall ill. He resented his parents when he was younger for neglecting him  (the way he'd cringe away from his mother's kisses and touches for example) and for being cold and distant towards him. Additionally, the reasons why the parents behave in such an eccentric exaggerated way is because we are seeing them as Jake remembers them, as caricatures of their former real selves. He remembers his mother as a loud shrill woman, who comes off as uneducated - saying Genius Edition instead of Genus edition multiple times or referring to quantum physics as ""quantum psychics"". As for his father, he remembers him as a critical, lewd man who is too simple-minded and ignorant - ""Even I have heard of that"", he says when talking about Pierre and Marie Curie. 

- Jake's parents' reaction towards Lucy's paintings mirror how his parents must have acted when he showed them his own paintings when he was younger. Feigned interest, polite ""ah!""s and ""mm!""s. The father doesn't understand the point of a painting without a person in it telling us how to feel. He says he prefers ""sport photographs"". Jake uses Lucy in his imagination as the painter; perhaps his psyche cannot handle reliving the rejection of his work. 

- Lucy tells the story of how they met and Jake imagines it as he wished for it to happen. We find out later on that what really happened was that Jake just stared at her in a bar while she was with her girlfriend. In his imagination though, she portrays him as a very smart, big-worded man and herself as a kind of enamored ignorant groupie who didn't have the nerve to go up and talk to him. She ""messes up"" twice in her story though: 1) by confusing events, something pointed out by the father and 2) referring that her ""girlfriend wanted to leave"". We assume then that it's her friend who's a girl but Lucy/Jake is just slipping up in his story. When relistening, the story sounds made-up and forced, almost movie-like.

- Jake's mother says that Jake didn't have a lot of friends growing up. She sadly says that ""friends are important cause life can be difficult"". This mirrors Jake's loneliness and complete lack of any social support. 

- There's an urn with Jimmy the dog's ashes in Jake's room. Explains why Jimmy pops in and out of existence. He's always shaking himself because maybe this is how Jake remembers him; a dog that's always wet and always outside. 

- Jake is an educated, smart, albeit socially awkward man with a childhood of negligence and a tense relationship with his parents. He seems to want to underline his superior intellect, his potential (we can see this through the many cultivated conversations he has, and how he often corrects the people around him, especially Lucy). He mentions people from school (such as himself) who were full of potential and then turned out to be nobodies. We are led to believe that he also missed his chances in life because his mother drilled into his head that he was not ""as naturally talented as other kids"". Maybe he ended up being a janitor because he spent his time taking care of his two ailing parents instead of furthering his career - because he still wants to win their love and approval. 

- For Jake, having a woman in his life means being validated by her and through her being validated by society (as smart, pretty, etc). We see this as Lucy validates Jake when he's taking care of his sick mother, calling him a ""devoted son"". Jake replies by saying that sometimes it feels like no one sees the good he does. We guess that even though he took care of his parents, they never really were grateful for it or expressed it. 

- Jake tries to delay his suicide for as long as possible: staying in the house, offering to return to the barn while they're in the car, stopping for ice cream, stopping at the school to drop the cups.. We see a lot of cups in the bin; this might mean that Jake has been down that path lots of times before and couldn't go through with it.",imqf5b

g4x5yud,"I haven't read all 3,000 comments here, but have seen none that explain the long dialogues the way my wife and son and I interpreted them after watching this last night. 

We saw them as iterations of a creative process. Like the janitor or Kaufman himself was trying out versions of dialogues. So what we see are the writer's attempts to find the right tone or make choices about what happens in a scene or interaction. 

""What age should the parents be? Maybe middle aged? No it's better if they are older.""

""The father's bandaid is on the right side of his forehead. No maybe it's on the left side.""

""I like opening with the young woman saying to herself 'I'm thinking of ending things.'. Maybe she's waiting on the sidewalk to be picked up. No maybe they are already in his car on the way to the farm. Maybe the opening line goes like this. No maybe like this...""

So we get many versions of both car rides strung together.",imqf5b

g46hila,"One of the most compelling shots for me was the overflowing bin of ice cream. As many have pointed out, it reveals how many times Jake has played through this fantasy. 
Something else that came to mind for me is the fact that some cups are less filled than others. Jake and the young woman comment in the car about how the ice cream is too sweet. Can it be that as he constantly replays his fantasy, he finds this play through becoming too “sweet” or too easy, causing him to take the detour to the high school to confront himself, despite trying to hide the real him from the fantasy him throughout (I.e. the washing machine filled with his janitor shirts).",imqf5b
g8kyg3r,"I didn't like the movie when I started watching, and I didn't finish it. It just seemed the kind of movie where everything is a mystery with lot of layers and multiple intrepretations, but I really had no desire to solve everything in the movie, so I just stopped watching. I read the story on Wikipedia, it made no sense, then I came here, read what the movie was really about and I am a bit intrigued. 

I caught quite early that the Janitor and Jake were possibly the same person, but I did not get in my limited viewing that the all the scenes in the past were fantasy. What REALLY bothers me, is the choice to frame the past events/fantasies from the point of view of the girl. It makes no sense, even when you know the twist, and it just makes the plot and especially the first viewing that much more obtuse and frustrating. 

Why are we watching these events unfold from the point of view of a semi-conscious figment of imagination, if the point of the movie is that they are subjective memories of a real person? If it were from the pov of Jake, which makes more sense, it would have made the story more accessible, which I think is a pro in these kinds of movies, not a con.",imqf5b

g46iokz,"There were so many tiny hints to the janitor's suicide peppered through the film. There was a moment in the second car journey where Lucy kept making raspberry noises and jerking her hands toward her face and it made me so uncomfortable given the end of the book. The nature of ""the question"" seemed like an odd thing to leave out of the film, even though it's introduced by the caller, and the ""answer"" the book provides is alluded to, right down to the red coat hanger on the door behind Jake in the final musical scene.

There were a couple of cool elements. I liked how he was portrayed as a pseudo intellectual and was slowly beginning to accept that fact.

Idk, the whole world as a manifestation of a crazy person's mind is so dull and overdone.

g4244cn,"First off, the Directed by Robert Zemeckis got probably the biggest laugh I'll conjure for a movie this year. 

Man, this movie is a fuckin trip. I expected nothing less from Kaufman but even with Synecdoche being one of my top five movies this still unsettled me and took me by surprise in a big way. 

I think what's different is that while Synecdoche gets into the weirdness right away and tells you up front you're in for some shit, this movie almost feels like a normal movie for the first 40 minutes or so. There's a 20 minutes dialogue scene in the car to start it off and even though there's some oddities like Jake seemingly stepping on the toes of her thoughts, this could easily be like any other relationship drama up until after dinner. I felt it was much more unsettling when things started getting weird later because we'd been introduced to this relatively normal story up until then. 

Enter David Thewlis and Toni Collette, the real gems of this movie. I loved everyone involved but their portrayal was ""universal in the intimate"" for me. Really felt like we were dealing with an old and isolated couple. They got a chance to shine in that dinner scene and even moreso once the rapid aging/de-aging sets in. 

Overall, I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this movie. The themes are strong and the reveals are interesting, but it's definitely going to take a few watches to get everything out of it and I'm looking forward to it. On a single watch I got the idea that a lot of this revolved around Jake more than the girl. 

It seemed like this movie was exploring two or more possible timelines at once. One in which they are in a relationship but she is thinking of leaving all the time, and one in which they maybe never dated, like she said when she spoke to the janitor that describing him would be like describing a mosquito that once bit her, and he is a janitor in his old age who is mocked by the kids and watching dumb love stories in his spare time. Each one revolved more around Jake's insecurity so while she was the center of the movie I have a feeling he was the one at the real focus. 

There are lots of clues and I'm not sure what to make of them yet. She seemed to be studying everything depending on the scene. Ageism, art, poetry, genetics. They each fit the theme but I think this works towards the idea that she is more of a creation of his, flowing in and out of professions as needed for his ideal girlfriend. Similar to how her name is a little fluid, the specifics seem to change a lot. This kind of tells me that they may have never even dated and a lot of this movie is a hallucination or creation of a sad and lonely man. In that way it reminded me of Synecdoche, how the whole thing can be seen as a tale of regret. 

This could arguably be reinforced by the stage performance at the end. He was putting on a show for the people and even the people watching were obviously fake shown by the stage aged makeup. He's entertaining himself and dreaming of the glory of appreciation. At least that's how I read it. 

It's hard to say for sure. This movie oddly felt more straightforward than Synecdoche or Anomalisa, but I think after watching it is actually much less so. Those movies are odd but their plots are very straightforward and in the present whereas this movie feels very abstract. I'm excited to read some interpretations in this thread, that's for sure. 

I'm feeling a solid 7/10 on this one. I think the step more towards the abstract was an iffy move for Kaufman, as if his movies aren't already abstract enough. BUT I am excited to rewatch this down the line and I can only see that score going up once I do.

Edit: worth mentioning that the song Jake sings at the end is called Lonely Room and it's from Oklahoma! It's a song where the antagonist of the show, who's main motivation is that he wants the woman that is in love with the protagonist, sings about how lonely he is and how much he thinks about having her.

giu10r3,"The difference between this movie and another movie like Fight Club or American Psycho is that in those other 'psychological thrillers', even if a viewer watches the film one time and the true meaning goes right over their head, the movie is interesting enough to enjoy even if the true meaning is misconstrued or overlooked. If you watched this once and didn't get it, you'd think it's a terrible movie as it is terribly boring - the only way to enjoy this movie is on the second time through when you know what to look for, meaning you have to spend 4 hours of your time to get any enjoyment out of it, and 2 of those hours on the first watch are spent in disinterested boredom. You need to watch American Psycho at least twice to understand it, but that first watch through is intriguing even without comprehension of the true meaning because it's about a chad business man who seems to be a psychopathic murder - not about people going to dinner. Same thing with Fight Club - on the surface it's an interesting action movie and can be watched as one, even though that isn't what it's really about. On the surface, I'm Thinking of Ending Things is a movie about meeting your boyfriend's parents. There is no action, there is seldom horror (which is also boring. somehow the horror is even boring), there's no.... Nothing!

Maybe it's supposed to be boring because it's about the janitor and the janitor is boring and has lived a boring life. Then they should have done the same concept with somebody else! You could make this same ""reflecting on my life while contemplating/justifying suicide"" with anyone. What about a Vietnam vet? Or a prisoner with a life sentence? Or anyone whose life experiences would have made the 'reflection plot' not so tiresomely mundane?

I understand why people both like and don't like this movie. The concept, message, story, and themes are sort of interesting, once you finally understand what's really going on. Even then, it's still way longer than it needs to be. Overall, I think it just tries to hard (and too long) to get across what is really not that complicated of an idea.",imqf5b
glwkmn3,"okay i want to hear people’s opinions on this, but i thought in this movie there was an underlying theme of pedophilia, jake says that younger is better, throughout the movie there are scenes of students in his school looking disgusted by him, the reference to the song ‘it’s cold outside’ & how jake defends it, and the part that stood out the most to me, when young jake sees janitor jake looking at him kissing the young woman, and calling him a ‘pervert’ then saying he is ‘very familiar’ with that, the young woman is confused by this. i cant work out what he meant by his familiarity with the topic.. maybe childhood abuse either? let me know your interpretation",imqf5b

Another detail is that there are lot of continuity errors, such as characters switching clothes, and I acknowledged how a phenomenal filmmaker like Kaufman wouldn’t do something like that on accident.

g4sfr68,"It really helps to know Rodgers & Hammerstein's 'Oklahoma!'

Potential Spoilers:

I interpreted the janitor as Jake realizing that he has been the villain of many women's lives. He goes to the ice cream place for both nostalgia, and because he likes to flirt with the staff. He is slowly realizing that they no longer find him cute, he is a creepy old man. 

The ballet sequence is taken from the finale of the first act of Oklahoma! Basically, in the play, Laurey is in love with Curly, but Jud, a large, simple, and angry man wants Laurey for himself. He is willing to attempt to take her by force. The first act ends with a nightmare ballet in which she is dancing with Curly and is about to marry him when Jud enters and kills Curly. In I'm Thinking of Ending Things, he sees himself as Jud, the one who has barged into these women's lives. 

It ends with him imagining that he's a brilliant physicist accepting an award ala A Beautiful Mind. In having everyone in clear stage make-up, I think it's him realizing it's only ever going to be a fantasy. He then sings Jud's song ""Lonely Room"" accepting that he is, in fact, the villain.

This is of course my subjective opinion. I really enjoyed the whole thing overall and I want to watch it again!",imqf5b
g4sqj7m,"Did anybody else get a serial-killery vibe from Jake when he drives down that road and she didn't want him to? He beats the wheel hard. And then she gets out of the car and the big trash can is full of ice cream cups? Like he has done that before, many times, taking women to an isolated place to murder them or something?

Maybe that's Kaufman just playing tricks on me.

I would have checked that first trash can, though.",imqf5b
g4uzbsy,"Finally watched it last night with no background info or context (haven't read the book and I didn't read any reviews or watch the trailer).

I enjoyed it, but I can also see why its audience rating on RT is 49% last I checked. It's like weirdo prog rock or surrealist art/literature. Not for everyone, and I don't mean that in a condescending ""if you didn't like this then you didn't *understand* it"" sort of way.

The movie is far more concerned with exploring moods/characters/ideas than providing consistent entertainment value, and that's not going to click for everyone. It reminds me of David Lynch's stuff or maybe something like Enter The Void (the latter of which I did *not* like). 

At its core it's really just a character study of one man's mediocrity, regret, and collapsed ambition. One of the criticisms I'm seeing in the comments is that there's no cohesive point and I don't think I perceived one exact central message on first viewing, but it created a sensation similar to a child lifting up a rock to see what kind of strange critters are crawling beneath the surface, except in this case Jake is the rock. Over the course of the film his life is laid bare and you can maybe connect with some of the lessons, experiences, and mistakes.",imqf5b
g5rwy9g,"This is a late comment. I really love this movie, just want to add my own mental notes on top of everything that's been said:

1) The way the movie progressed is like sleep to me, like the beginning car ride in winter lulled me into a relaxed state and then the REM stage and full on dream logic commenced. Also some elements jumped out to me like wanting very much to go somewhere or being late for somewhere and being constantly prevented (Lucy wanting to go home). Like, Ive had this kind of dream before

2) at the beginning, they were talking about writing and Jake said he was writing about this woman named Lucy who was beautiful and ideal

3) bonedog, the lines about going home  moon-landed and having special powers. The janitor was frustrated about not achieving more in life or being tied down by his farm life because he has full knowledge of what is out there, that there was more to life he missed out on. Jake even commented that it was like it was written about him. Really sad, really relatable

4) while watching it for the first time with no prior research done, I slowly realized it was happening in *a* mind, but it only dawned on me later on whose mind it was. It was *a* mind to me because the people would often talk in a similar way without reason, using the same words and phrases (for some reason some words standout sometimes like Treacherous use din different instances)",imqf5b

The whole thing is about him thinking about missed opportunities. The good looking Jake is who he thinks he should have been but the Janitor is who he became. So the Janitor is the one who wins the ""fight"" and good looking Jake dies. Just had this on my mind, dunno if it's been posted.",imqf5b

gey9tb4,"My initial interpretation was that Jake was suffering from early Alzheimers/Dementia, he's losing track of his memories and is contemplating ending things because he saw how badly his father suffered. 

Jessie Buckley was Jake's wife or girlfriend, he can't remember anymore. He can't remember how they met which is why we're given multiple versions of their first encounter. He can't remember her name which is why she's referred to as Lucy, Louise, and Ames throughout the film. He's even starting to forget what she looked like and is getting her appearance mixed with an actor (Colby Minifie from the Robert Zemeckis film). 

This would ""explain"" why Jessie Buckley's costume changes through the film and why the film appears to be set in the '70s but characters have iPhones. It's also why the dog randomly appears, and it's also why characters randomly quote poems and literature. Jake is losing track of fiction and reality. 

However, I think the interpretation that Jake is a sad, old, and lonely man who's recounting his life through the lens of his attractive ""girlfriend"" is more accurate. He basically making up all these bullshit scenarios to keep on living but deep down he realises how pathetic it is. ""I'm thinking of ending things"" refers to Jake deciding to end fantasy.",imqf5b

gdmxi2w,"For me, the movie is Jake's story and Lucy is the vehicle for the audience into his world and his mind. I don't think the movie is set at any specific time or follows any linear track of time. Throughout the movie we see many characters at different points in their lives, often shown out of order. It is a window into Jake's mind and his life; his desires and fears. 

Jake wants Louisa to be with him.. Throughout the movie, Jake tries to direct and control the people around him, including Louisa, and is upset and sometimes angry when they do not do as he would want. At dinner, he gives non-verbal cues to his parents on how to act around Louisa. He tries to keep her out of the basement where his paintings were sitting and janitors clothes were washing. His mother told Louisa not to let Jake control her because that was his nature. But Louisa didn't really fit into his fantasy. They would get along for a moment but it wouldd devolve into arguments where they throw pretentious monologue at each other. They stop at the school where Jake thinks they're going to have sex but they are interrupted by the janitor. Who is the Janitor? Possibly Jake. The Janitor's clothes were washing in Jake's basement. At several points in the movie Jake is trying to tell Louisa about a book or movie he read and she ignores what he is saying and he is visibly upset. That is what he is shown to be afraid of: disapproval. He won the 'diligence' button as a child which to him was the inferior one. 

When he sings his song at the end and everyone applauds, Louisa applauds with them. Aged but happy. We know this isn't, this can't be the same Louisa we knew at the beginning. She was thinking of ending things. Maybe this is his idealized version of her. Or maybe she just never said no. But when everyone applauds he his happy. The alternate ending is he never ends up with beautiful Louisa. He instead becomes a lonely janitor. He fantasized about a different life. But someone has to be a maggot infested pig. So why not him?

I liked it because I like movies with ideas to unpack but I see why someone wouldn't like it. The dialogue is wordy and the imagery is jarring and the narrative is non-linear. I liked the technical aspects as well. Nice camera movement and framing and the music and imagery were stellar, in my opinion.",imqf5b
gpfaqfm,"In the beginning of the movie, she says that he says something along the lines of how he believes that thoughts are closer to reality than actions. You can do and say anything but you cannot fake thoughts. 

I thought about this after the movie ended and I figured out (partly with the help of this thread), that it was all the fantasy of the janitor to while away the pointlessness of his life. Him telling Lucy (an offshoot of his own mind) that you can’t fake thoughts was a desperate attempt on his part to convince himself that his fantasy was real. That his thoughts were real. 

Him speaking as her when she said that she was thinking of ending things goes to show that ultimately, he knew she wasn’t going to stick around. He knew that she wasn’t even going to tell her parents about him. His self-worth was at the baseline from the beginning of the fantasy even though he *attempts* to become the hero of his fantasy.",imqf5b
g4ega3s,"The rewatch watch of this film is actually brilliant. The detail in the writing just blossoms. Pairs well with The Caretaker's ""Everywhere at the end of time"".

The fragmented, impulsive dialogue at the dinner scene is simply incredible and chilling - Kaufman constructs the damaged psyche of Jake perfectly here. You can map the way his mind jumps to fill in the blanks of this idealized conversation using the neurosis of his mother and the judgement of his father. What felt bizarre yet somehow lucid on first watch is now heartbreaking and constantly deteriorating.

Everything just completely falls into place. 

Also love the almost subliminal level of the reveals: Audio suddenly spikes on specific speech/breathing inflections, the parents' dialogue literally looping at times. More obviously: The actress for ""Lucy"" completely changes in the car for brief moments to the actress in the Diner movie, or his media collection being a table of contents for all of the car conversation. There is a ton of work done to illustrate Jake's mind with such detail I can't but be flat out astounded.",imqf5b
g68h3uz,"I know the janitor ending is supposed to be the explanation but I think:

The story she tells at dinner is true, they did have an interaction at trivia night or a bar but she got a call from her friend and went outside to take it or that friend played some role in intimidating him. He never got her number and they never started dating.

Even though she’s the narrator and we hear her internal monologue the movie is actually from Jake’s perspective. Her paintings turn out to be the work of a  painter he idolized. She is an imagined version of what he thinks a relationship could have been like. Shea great painter and poet and scientist and he is stuck on his own shortcomings and imagining how she would never accept him or his family with all of their quirks and negative attributes. 

The monologue from her perspective when she’s talking to the janitor ends with “40 years ago” and okay so this is Jake the janitor dwelling on a girl he wanted to approach at a bar when he was 30.

Obviously the title has a double meaning I’m thinking of ending the relationship or I’m thinking of killing myself. 

Families develop weird internal dynamics as they are isolated from outside influences. The farm is just to illustrate that isolation and show how grotesque meeting someone’s family can seem and how much responsibility and expectation is built into that interaction. Janitor Jake watched his parents age and die for real, but meeting someone’s parents creates the expectation that you may have to watch these people in their decline alongside your partner.

Incredibly depressing and beautiful experience.",imqf5b
g42xem4,I don't know about you guys but Toni Collette might as well be my early pick for Best Supporting Actress. She nailed this role as usual.,imqf5b
g5bh7tc,"This is maybe the best movie I’ve ever seen that examines loneliness and sadness. He can’t figure out why he is what he is: a janitor in a small town. He’s intelligent, as is evidenced by his interests in poetry and art as well as the conversations he imagines with the women he wishes loved him. His mother even mentions that he was smart as a child. But he is caught in this small town, first as the caretaker of his parents who have dementia and health problems, then as a man who has never been anything other than a janitor. He gives up because his loneliness eats him up and as he dies and imagines a world of people that applaud him the real truth is what the pig says to him, someone had to be this person so it might as well be you. 

The component of being smart but not especially smart and then having an elaborate fantasy life is really insightful. I think there are a lot of people like that. People who were never special but not dumb and can’t escape the feeling that they should be more. They live in fantasy because it’s better than living in the now and that fantasy is also painful because eventually they have to return to reality. The dance where he kills his fantasy self with the reality of himself is so beautiful and sad it honestly hurt to watch. 

The components of the fantasy life really captures something about living in your own head that I don’t think I see very much in film. The sudden changes in conversations he imagines. The intrusion of things that make him angry (real memories, I suspect, of things that did frustrate him at the time). Then his imagined meeting with his family wandering to his parents as elderly and faltering, as middle aged and doting, as strong and doing housework. It has a weird, unique quality of a mind wandering as someone imagines something. 

There are a lot of details that really stuck with me but maybe the biggest was when the girl walks into the school and sees a dumpster full of Blizzard cups. Like J Alfred Prufrock measuring his life in coffee spoons, Jake has measured his lonely life in blizzards that he has purchased and eaten as he left work.",imqf5b
g4vtddy,"I felt like while it was certainly well made and well preformed, it wasn't one of Kaufman's strongest films. At least in my view I feel like David Lynch handles these sort of films>! (where the protagonist is basically unable to cope with their own failures/inadequacies and creates a imaginary world around themselves) !<a lot better, with films like Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive.

The performances are definitely great and the film is shot, framed, lit and edited very well, but I found myself becoming less invested in the characters as the film went on>! as they continued dissociate with their original personalities and Jake's memories and fantasies got garbled up with poetry,5 minute long spoken essays on John Cassavettes  films  and prolonged ballet sequences etc.  !<At least in my view while the tone and atmosphere were very good at making me feel what the film wanted me to, it became difficult for me to remain invested in the main character or their struggle.

I've loved most of Kaufman's work, but I think that this film is probably going to be the least accessible film he'll ever make and probably the one that illicits the most mixed reception from it's viewers.  For me, this definitely isn't a bad film by  any stretch, but at the same time, I'd probably put it as one of Kaufman's weakest films in my personal opinion, probably giving it a 6/10 because at least for me it felt un-involving.

That being said. I wish more filmmakers were able to have the balls/artistic freedom to make the kind of movies they wanted to and be willing/able to go out there and take risks. Even if the film didn't really work for me, Kaufman gets points as usual for his willingness to be out there and not play it safe, mainly because I'd rather see writers/directors like Kaufman attempt something and fail rather than constantly have their visions butchered by studio interference. Currently I'd say my favorite Kaufman movie is still Adaptation.",imqf5b

You know those nights where you dream so much, you have so many dreams switching one after another after another but they all take place in the same room  and almost have the same narrative, but the environment and people differ just slightly (something out of place or different colored walls, same people wearing different clothes but doing the same actions etc.). I loved that aspect of it as someone who dreams a lot, it was like watching a series of dreams in motion, and sometimes you just can't make sense of dreams.

g4qt3e5,"I found reading the synopsis and explanation afterwards to be far more compelling than anything the film itself provided.

The film introduces itself as being in the mind of the girlfriend who is thinking of breaking up with her boyfriend.  How in god's name is any reasonable person supposed to make the connection that this is actually a fantasy on the part of the male character?  The clues given are far too few and vague, and I really doubt any more than an extreme minority of film watchers (who haven't read the book) would actually be able to correctly interpret the plot.  It's extremely poor execution, but since it's Kaufman it will largely get a pass because people will not want to appear to be ""dumb"" or ""unsophisticated.""  Not ""getting it"" isn't a failure on your part, it's a failure of the filmmaker to convey a remotely coherent theme/narrative.

I say this as someone who has absolutely adored a lot of Kaufman's work.  The difference in those films is that you have something compelling on the surface while watching, but with way deeper themes and meaning that you may miss the first time around.  I don't believe rewatching this film any number of times would have lead me particularly closer to its actual meaning, and I don't think what is presented on the screen consistently supports what it is supposedly about.",imqf5b

g57ghlk,"The basement door was one of the things I found most intriguing. I interpreted the scotch tape as a fragile and final attempt by Jake to keep crucial secrets locked away from other fragmented personalities. Fragile because Jake is nearing death and doesn’t have the strength to create a stronger boundary against the part of his psyche that is wondering around and making discoveries: Lucy. 

Prior to Lucy entering the basement, we see the most vibrant version of his mother. She tells Lucy very revealing information: “Jake can be controlling. I think it’s the other side of his type of personality. He needs to control everything. There are so many, many things that make him nervous.” I’ll come back to this in a sec....

The moment this version of his mom enters is a brilliant interpretation of someone suffering Dissociative Personality Disorder. In this case Jake. 

Jakes mother at dinner constantly looking to him in fear, him forcing her to eat the baby food, or him deciding to show Lucy the barn first while his mother notices are just a few indications that Jake is the primary personality to the various fragmented personalities we are seeing interacting in his head. However, this begins to change. 

When the vibrant version of Jakes mother comes into play, you’ll notice how abruptly she enters. This is also the only time we see her without Jake in the scene. Something in the conversation with Lucy and his dad right before triggered Jake, causing this energetic and young version of his mother to swiftly take control. 

Obviously this mother was from a time when Jake was a child. She tells Lucy: “I’m probably to blame” referring to his need to be in control and for the few people in his life to follow his rules. She must have caused some serious trauma and is a version of his mother he worked hard to keep suppressed.
Something caused him to slip up and you LITERALLY see her slide into the scene like she was waiting for the right moment. It’s fascinating. 

Now we have a fragmented and dominant version of his mother in control of imagined and unaware Lucy. His mother tells Lucy to “take the darn nightgown to the basement.” She does this in a hushed voice to not trigger Jake in taking back control. 

Seeing Jake inaudibly panicking and banging on the door as Lucy descends down, shows that Jake is losing the power to keep those in his life to follow his rules...referring back to what his mother mentions. These fragmented personalities schemed against him to reveal secrets. 

I think that’s why the next interpretation of his mother is her dead.

g64idio,"I had mixed feelings about the film. On a first viewing I didn't really like it much at all, I thought it started strong but lost me from the long car conversation onwards. I thought the pacing was pretty bad, like I said the aforementioned car conversation for 20+ minutes slap bang in the middle of the film just seemed so indulgent and unnecessary. I thought the ideas could have been communicated better than through a long rambling conversation. It seemed so self-indulgent and really tested my patience.  And the end confused me - more on that in a second.

It reminded me of a few things - Eraserhead, with the awkward meeting with the parents at the start. Except in this it seemed to be more about anxiety surrounding relationships than becoming a father.

Also reminded me of the Todd Solondz film Dark Horse, with the theme of a loner character who has wasted opportunities he's had - and fantasises a lot about what's happening in his head.

And the last thing it reminded me of was the game Silent Hill: Shattered Memories. It takes place during a snowstorm, you end up at a high school and there's a twist about the games plot being a collection of fragmented memories. There's also a change in character perspective at the end that makes you rethink things.

I read a review saying the whole film is from the perspective of Jake, not the girlfriend, which is never made very clear. I like surreal films and odd narratives but that just seemed willfully obtuse in a way that was off-putting, which can be said for a lot of the film.

Having said all that though, I do want to watch this again. I think it's a really interesting film and I'll probably watch it with a totally different perspective the second time around. I keep thinking about it.

On the other hand, I dunno. It seems to be a super depressing film about a guy looking back on his life and imagining what could have been. It just seemed like an excercise in bleak nihilism, I don't know what else I'm meant to get out of it.",imqf5b

Jake’s direct words would be the main thoughts, the point of the iceberg.

Lucy’s words are a part of his hidden consciousness, the rebuttals to the main consciousness’s theories, the devil’s advocate. 

Then on a deeper level, Lucy’s thoughts, mainly “I’m thinking of ending things” that represent the Janitor’s suicidal thoughts, are the subconscious layer of his mind.

gkve884,"I think i understand the movie for the most part now. Clearly the main girl represents Jake’s idealized relationships & I think the progression of the movie illustrates that he has narcissistic, grandeur tendencies.

However there is one part i am very confused by. The part in the ice cream shop where the woman working says that the smell is NOT varnish. I had no idea what the significance of this was. Obviously everyone in the movie is some type of personified branch of Jake’s thought processes, and therefore this is something that he is saying to himself. So what exactly is the significance of this?

One of my friends interpreted it as Jake in present day is slowly dying as he is recollecting all these falsified memories. She argued that maybe he is killing himself in a running car in the garage, which would line up with the fact that the smell is “not varnish”, and the fact that the movie seemed to get slightly more absurd as it progressed which would be explained by carbon monoxide poisoning. It would also line up with the fact that Jake was mediocre at best in everything that he tried, even though he desired to be exceptional.

g46xods,"This film seems to me shockingly difficult to understand without the literary background of all the media referenced. I've loved Ice since university. I genuinely don't think you can truly get this film without reading it.


""Ice is set during an apocalypse in which a massive, monolithic ice shelf, caused by nuclear war, is engulfing the earth. The male protagonist, and narrator of the story, spends the narrative feverishly pursuing a young, nameless woman, and contemplating the overwhelming but conflicting feelings he has for her, that slowly end up being intruded by the worsening atmosphere of the setting. Initially he must negotiate the presence of the girl's husband and later he faces more serious opposition from the Warden who seeks to keep her under his control. Christopher Priest, in his introduction to the novel, writes that the book is ""virtually plotless"" and ""told in scenes of happenstance and coincidence.""[2]

Is this some greater truth that I have not transcended far enough to fully realize? Or do we just like it’s vibe?

g4m4jsm,"It’s one of those movies I knew would leave an impact on me while I was still watching it. I could also tell the person who made it was in total control of their intentions. Kaufman is a confident filmmaker. Though his films may feel like brain puzzles, he always has us emotionally invested even when we’re trying to rationally make sense of the plot and its meanings. He never stops thinking the most of us. He trusts us to follow his train of thought even if the path isn’t easy or pleasant. And I totally understand how some viewers might think this film is not for them - it’s a deeply personal experience that will resonate with some people more than others. Even those who enjoyed the film seem to be loving it for very particular reasons and getting different things out of it (and that’s great!).

To me, this is a story about our inner lives, about the fantasies we create in our internal worlds (minds) to cope, to feel less lonely and more worthy of love - and about the harsh contrast with a reality of buried aspirations, forgotten dreams, and the countless possibilities we renounce with every choice we make. You can either be a Broadway star or a renowned physicist, but life doesn’t give you enough time to possibly be both. You can have all the intellectual resources and highest ambitions at you disposal, and still get to the end with no real opportunities and the persistent feeling you didn’t live up to your potential. You can get caught up on a far-fetched concept of success and forget to cherish what you have. You can let the unresolved issues of a distant past linger on to the point they will define your present (psychologically, time is not linear, but unpredictable and chaotic). You can get so self-absorbed you’ll disregard the most important people in your life and never resolve the complex relationships between you (notice how Jake acts aggressively towards his parents - even ashamed of their “intellectual inferiority"" - but is shown to be devastated at the moment of their passing, or how important it is for him to make them proud of his achievements in the – clearly imaginary - final scene).

At the end, the hints that the three characters (Jake, the girl and the janitor) are the same person pay off in a big way. It’s like Kaufman is telling us that we are not alone in our loneliness, that our inner thoughts are shared by countless people, and that we are all united by this great human experience. But this film is not a downer, even though I initially felt pretty low after seeing it. The more I think about it, the more I get the sense that the Kaufman is saying that we have a choice. That we can use our time here to truly connect with each other, to be open and show our true selves, to appreciate those we love while we still have them, and to have the courage to face our reality. Because the comfort of fantasy, he argues, will only takes us so far until it crumbles around us. Sure, it can hurt. But like the characters of Eternal Sunshine... realize when they choose to stay together (fully aware of the pain of an inevitable break up), the rewards of living it and taking a chance are worth it.",imqf5b

g4dot8b,"Here's my take on some of this.  Lots of great posts in here, especially talking about the plot of the book (which I haven't read), but I see a sort of meta-level to this that Kaufman added which I found very interesting and very sad.

""Janitor recalls a girl he tried to get with and fantasizes about whether it had worked out"".  Okay, sure.  That's technically the plot, but what really stays with me from the movie is the depression and dread.  I see the narrative as the internal struggle between ""this is what you want"" and ""this is what you deserve"".  This is exemplified by how Ms. Dream Girl, literally a fantasy, is constantly trying to end their relationship, to knock down his ego, to literally leave his family.  Every time things get too ""perfect"" in the fantasy, the neuroses creeps in ... over-correcting details of how it ""really"" is, changing minutia when they aren't ideal or he hits a dead end, etc.

So on the meta-level, very similar to Adaptation actually, we are seeing Charlie's neuroses and depression about his own abilities and worth.  Every ""ideal"" beat ends up being corrupted by a depressed self-doubt.

Ideal: ""they're intellectuals and they have this great conversation about cinema"" -> self-doubt: ""you can't write good criticism, you're just going to end up pasting in some Pauline Kael review that you read once""

Ideal: ""there will be this great 'meet this family' scene"" -> self-doubt: ""you'll have to keep inserting quirky weirdness out of nowhere to keep it interesting"" (shown by Jesse Plemons literally nodding to give 'permission' for a conversation to go down a new path)

Ideal: ""you can subvert the book ending and do a self-referential Kaufman thing"" -> self-doubt: ""they already do that in Oklahoma, you're just literally copying Oklahoma into the script""

I see Kaufman and sort of throwing his hands up and saying ""why can't it be better"" constantly.  There's a universe in which you can just adapt the book - ""it's just a fantasy!"" (not to diminish the book, again I haven't read it) - but by trying to ""Kaufmanize"" it, he is doubting his abilities to deliver and then puts that right into the screenplay.  You can almost hear him going ""aha, but the fantasy girl will meta-fy the story by not playing by the protagonist's rules"" and then thinking ""oh you're just getting that because you over-analyze how that type of device even works, you're anticipating your own Pauline Kael review before the movie even comes out and you're just trying to cleverly acknowledge and get ahead of it"" and then THAT makes it into the script.

I'm rambling but, basically, this really struck a chord with me because I've always related to Kaufman's ability to make you feel internalized doubt and depression.  I think about Eternal Sunshine, where Joel thinks/writes ""why do I fall in love with every woman who shows me the least bit of attention"", and the camera reveals that Clementine is sat much farther away than we initially thought.  This movie felt like he had characters start ripping apart that scene and criticize why it's a cheap device that uses narrative cheats to manipulate your emotions.",imqf5b

g66tkim,"I liked the movie, or at least, enjoyed the first and second part. The ending (last 20-ish minutes) left a lot to be desired.

There is a lot of room for interpretation, which some people enjoy and other dislike. I watched this with my mom, we both were entranced by the trailer. I ended up enjoying most of the movie while my mother hated it, when we started to notice nothing made sense, every theory we shared, random detail we noticed that assumed were ghosts, soul reincarnation shenanigans, psychological issues, relationship issues, disassociation, alucinations, etc, where all discarded by the 3/4 part of the film, only to turn out to be ""imaginated by the old janitor guy"".

All in all, I think the ""reveal"" could be a little clearer. (I honestly had no idea what kind of movie we were getting into, and a clearer end could help with, well, helping the viewer observe and understand the whole two hours that they saw in a different view) I think the last part of the movie should have focused more on revealing that our main character is the guy, and that she doesn't exist. Neither my mother nor I understood that while watching nor in our ""after-movie-talk"". I disliked the final dance secuence. I felt it added nothing substantial to the movie. I felt the same with some of the conversations they had in the car, but I also understand how those were necessary to set the mood, show the characters and how unnervingly eternal the journey was.

He wanted his conscience to be okay with it by showing how he cared for his mother but why do we see him flinch every time she touches him or kisses him on the cheek? Also, I think the scabby-armed ice-cream girl was his object of affection because she was ""attainable"" and he made her prettier in his fantasies but even she didn't want him (which she admits to the janitor in the school hallway). Ugh, this film is too much (haven't read the book).",imqf5b
g4ertvw,"I didn’t read the book but the whole premise for the movie clicked around the midway point (when Jake says they met at a cafe where the young woman works and he ordered the Santa Fe burger), so if someone could give me my Diligent Super Genus award it’d really make my day.

I enjoyed the film and appreciated that it tried to literally embody a lot of the themes it was grappling with (namely issues like identity, presence, and reality in an era where so much of our attention is spent in fictional worlds or on symbolic representations of faraway people that we’ll never meet). I liked the idea that “objective reality” is a lonely old janitor in a high school but we spend so little time with him because so much of his life is spent daydreaming. The characters talk about movies like a mind-virus that take up more mental real estate than they maybe should, but a lot of their conversations are still about the ideas or works of other “highbrow” people, to the point that the young woman’s personality (and even the woman portraying her) pivot dramatically while she’s reciting an old film review verbatim.

That being said, I wish that the ending had gone a more traditional horror route. I liked the choreography and all, but I don’t understand what the movie gained by subverting expectations and, after learning about the original ending in the book, I think it would have been more effective. I’ve seen other people write that they absolutely loved the dance sequence, that it was their favorite part of the movie, etc. but my experience was mostly one of, like, Brechtian alienation where I couldn’t help but notice the artifice of the film and became emotionally distant to what could have otherwise been a gut punch of an ending. Idk, maybe I’m just a sadomasochist and Charlie Kaufman has good reasons to play against that impulse in viewers, but I was hoping for more of fever dream descent into hell ala something like Heredity.

I watched it with my roommate last night and *hated* it right after the end credits rolled. Then, we both explained what we thought it was about (and were pretty much completely wrong), and hopped on reddit to look up what it all meant. 

After reading the analyses I started to understand more, and after waking up today I've found myself going back through random scenes and matching them up with the ""janitor fantasy"" explanation — the allegory in each scene makes sense!

The way his father was always too close to the young woman, the way she she trembled when he hugged her (he had the wrench in his hand and I felt like it was a clue), he was just always in her bubble in an unsubtle way. That tied with the scene when they're kissing and Jake stops because he knows they're being watched and mentions he's all too familiar with it. Also the way the brown haired girl pushed about being scared for the young woman. The fact that Jake talked about the messy ice cream as if it we're a burden he needed to get off his chest because he can't go on with it. I interpreted the dance scene as him having the opportunity to form a strong bond and marry this young woman, only to be stopped by the evils in himself which he now must relive over and over (thus the accumulation of brrr cups in the trash) leaving him contemplating suicide with only the question of ""what if"". What if I had been more intelligent and confident that night, what if I was able to make her see me for who I am, what if I didn't hurt her because she didn't.

g4t3hho,"So, I didn't enjoy this as much as I'd hoped. When I finished watching, I read the synopsis of the book and was like ""oh wow, they should have made a film out of *that*!"".

My understanding is that, while the book is similarly weird and twisty, it is ultimately quite unambiguous as to what's really going on by the end of the story. The film, however, does all of the weirdness but doesn't tie this together with a concrete, unambiguous ending. The most damning indictment of the film is that I actually figured out what was actually going on halfway through (>!that this is basically the dying dream of Jake as he kills himself!<) but dismissed that hypothesis because I couldn't believe that the twist would be so straightforward! 

So yeah, I was a bit disappointed. As a story, it ends up being a bit too ambiguous to really feel satisfying. As a mood piece, it's fine but it needed to be a bit 'more': a little more horrifying, a little more funny, a little more awkward. The long conversations in the car might be more interesting on a repeat viewing but without a good idea of what's really going on, it is a little hard to stay interested in them; you don't really know what you're looking for the first time to watch it. 

I have to say that all the actors involved did a really good job. I have a hunch that they shot a lot of the same scenes but with different direction. For example, the dinner scene. I think they probably shot it multiple times but in different ways (""this time you're all sad and awkward, this time you're all getting along well, this time you're suspicious of each other""). But I'm just guessing here, if they were changing tone in a single take, that's very impressive!",imqf5b

I thought she was an actual girl he stalked and kidnapped off the streets to take to his even elderly-er parents farmhouse in the middle of a snowstorm with the intention of sleeping with her. I thought the ice-cream place scene was actually happening and there was an actual young girl trying to warn her that something was wrong.

g429xm9,"When I watched the film last night, I had nothing but questions. Most of this movie went over my head on initial viewing. I haven't read the book, but I've seen everything Charlie Kaufman has made. I've since done a lot of research and filled in some of the blanks, so hopefully this analysis will be helpful to others.

First off, I didn't understand whose perspective this movie was being told from. In the end credits, Jesse Plemons gets first billing, and he is also the only one named (Jake). Jessie Buckley is only known as ""young woman"" and her name changes throughout the movie (Lucy, Lucia, Louisa, Ames???) which leads me to believe she is an amalgamation of women throughout Jake's life (that would also explain why the story of how they met keeps changing). The janitor who is seen throughout appears to be an older version of Jake looking back on his life and considering suicide (the true interpretation of the title). However, I was curious why so much of the film's point of view was told from Lucy's eyes. Is this whole movie about Jake stuck in his head or did Lucy actually exist?

There were several clues that suggested Lucy wasn't a real person (or perhaps a product of his imagination, or festering mental illness). Jake is always interrupting Lucy, as if he can hear or anticipate her thoughts. Or maybe he is interrupting his own train of thinking during long, lonely drives to work? Then there are the missed phone calls she keeps getting from herself (is this Jake trying to break through his delusion?). And of course the obvious things like Lucy seeing herself in Jake's childhood photo and finding her own poem in Jake's journal in his old bedroom.

After reading a few articles, I came upon an extremely helpful Slate column which clarified and contextualized many points from the novel. Here is a brief summation:

>Both versions of I’m Thinking of Ending Things, in the broadest possible sense, are about an imaginary couple on an imaginary road trip dreamed up by an elderly high school janitor who is contemplating suicide. Imaginary isn’t quite the right word, though, because Jake, the man on the road trip, is a younger version of the janitor himself, while the woman is loosely based on a real woman the janitor briefly encountered in a bar decades earlier. The narrative is a sort of thought experiment about what it might have been like, from the woman’s perspective, if the janitor had dated her and brought her home to see his parents. In the book, the janitor explicitly spells out what’s happening and why, writing: “We had to try putting her with us. To see what could happen. It was her story to tell.” ([Source](https://slate.com/culture/2020/09/im-thinking-ending-things-twist-explained-movie-book.html))

So while most of the film is told from Lucy's (imagined) perspective, it is ultimately Jake putting words into her mouth. It's like an elaborate fantasy sequence pieced together from scenes in books, movies, poems, musicals and observations from life. This includes all the feminist rhetoric that permeates throughout, which is especially ironic since she's not even real or three-dimensional in that sense (though Jessie Buckley is clearly the standout of the film). He's basically an unreliable narrator regurgitating what he's hearing all around him in a school setting. That idea embodies the Oscar Wilde quote: “Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else’s opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation.”

The time shifts throughout reminded me a lot of Synecdoche, New York, except in that film, time was always skipping ahead, whereas here the past is fluid and malleable, which is why the memories and details keep changing. Is it Alzheimer's and dementia at work? When old janitor Jake is snowed in in his truck, is it a deliberate act of self-sabotage? Is the whole movie told in these final moments, as he succumbs to hypothermia, synapses firing wildly into the night?

There are still a lot of things that remain unclear to me. Like how Lucy keeps getting missed phone calls from herself (the voice at the other end of the line appears to be the janitor himself). The fact that the basement is kept off-limits and has scratches all over the door (that's way too high for a dog to reach; is it a metaphor for Jake's locked subconscious?). Jimmy's uncontrollable shaking tic (we see the dog's urn in Jake's childhood bedroom, so he's clearly a phantom of the past.). The parents' erratic behavior (although I can explain away the rapid aging and de-aging as a product of unreliable memory). The pig being eaten alive by maggots (heavy-handed symbolism?). The ending which culminates in a ballet sequence and a musical number, even though Jake claims to hate musicals (and yet is proficient in many of them, maybe not even consciously so). And of course the whole blizzard scene at Tulsey Town with the ice cream being too sweet (all those empty cups in the trash seem to indicate he's a regular at that particular stand, as well as being overly familiar with the women who work there). I initially thought the 15-year-old girl at the counter with the rash on her arms was supposed to be a representation of Lucy at that age, since she recognized her. But maybe she was just another one of Jake's many unrequited crushes.

As someone who has also been alone most of their life, I can attest to know exactly what it's like to fantasize about women and create elaborate scenarios in my head. At one point, Jake talks about Wordsworth poems (which may be the catalyst for Lucy's inception) which are about ""a beautiful, idealized woman \[who dies young\]."" Maybe there is something to that.

After giving it considerable thought, this is probably my favorite movie of the year so far. To me, it's more powerful than traditional horror because it represents the horror of life; getting older and obsolete and ugly. There is a conversation they have at a certain point about the value of being young, which really resonated with me (""old people are the ash heap of youth""). The hopelessness of life is scarier than any tangible monster.",imqf5b
g431buf,Entire movie is just Jack Torrance reliving his past as he freezes to death in the hedgemaze.,imqf5b
g4v5ilw,"I'm a huge Charlie Kaufman fan and I hated this movie.

So I came here and read people's thoughts. Read the synopsis of the book. Thought about it a bit.

I still think the movie missed the mark, but less so than I did before I started poking at it.

One random thought: I did notice that Buckley's coat changes color several times during the movie. Her hair did too I believe. She goes from sort-of a waif-ish trope to a more hardened character.

Anyway, there's a cognitive disorder called \`catastrophizing\` and one of the manifestations is such:

\`This kind of catastrophizing occurs when we look to the future and anticipate all the things that are going to go wrong.\` ([https://psychcentral.com/lib/what-is-catastrophizing/](https://psychcentral.com/lib/what-is-catastrophizing/))

Upon further reflection it felt like the janitor, who is looking back and fantasizing about taking a trip with a fantasy girlfriend, was stuck catastrophizing and couldn't stop. He was looking back, and imagining taking a road trip with a girlfriend back to his childhood home. He was seeking some sort of validation of his background. He has a girlfriend, she accepts him, his faults, and his past.

But even in his own fantasy, he can't stop things from going wrong. Right away, the girl wants to end the relationship. The dog isn't right. The parents aren't right. The girlfriend wants to go. The snowstorm won't let up. They even stop for ice cream in what (I imagine) was supposed to be a quintessential American moment, and that goes wrong. The whole thing is maddening to people who catastrophize . The person can't even \*imagine\* or \*dream\* of a happy time without the brain diverting into catastrophe. 

And all the cups in the garbage showed that he's been doing this over and over and he can't get it right.

So, to me it's now quite a sad movie. An old lonely man, trying to imagine what could have gone right, can't even do that without having horrible things happen. Some people can't stop and they get exhausted from it. And it can't go on.",imqf5b

g62eah7,"So I’d never read the book before I watched the movie and I apparently absolutely misunderstood what this movie was about. I was convinced it was feminist analysis of patriarchy. The idea that she was scared to break up with her boyfriend. The fact that she’s always wanting to leave but he won’t let her. The time passing by as her being trapped in this relationship. The other woman telling her that she was in danger. Her name and job title changing as a sign that she was disappearing into an abstraction of womanhood. The picture on the wall that she swears is herself, but is actually him is the sign that he is beginning to consume her, she is nothing outside of him. 

I’ve seen a lot of people comment how they didn’t like this movie because they didn’t get it, and clearly I missed the mark with how I interpreted this movie, but I still loved it. There’s something eerily compelling about art that you know is saying something very clearly but you can’t quite put your finger on what exactly it’s saying.  Also this movie is just so eerie and ethereal that I think that makes it a compelling watch even if I didn’t fully understand the plot.",imqf5b
g922p3f,"Every person who is saying it is so flat and messy is just proving how important art is.

True art doesn't give a shit about the viewer, it only cares about expressing the lies helping us to realise truth.

Most modern films have a very linear narrative and are mostly based on superhero comics that have a formulaic structure. So much of modern cinema is about telling (instead of showing) and I can appreciate why some people find this film extremely challenging.

Enjoying this film has nothing to do with intellect, but it has everything to do with whether you are willing to give yourself to the art, and truly put in the work to understand what this film is communicating. The film has an inherent message, and to some it may seem like mayhem, but every part of this film holds meaning to the overriding message.

I felt as though the message of this film was intensely haunting and also rewarding. The book it is based on is alot less cryptic than as projected through the lense of CK.

I agree with the view that there are more challenging and perhaps better structured films, but I still feel this in no way takes away from this incredible artform.",imqf5b

His touch, the conversations, the story, the ending, they all show that being a narcissist doesn't always mean being an asshole. Sometimes it means getting caught up in your own ideas and being defeated by them, and for his brutal honesty in admitting that defeat, his films, for me, revitalize the idea of tragedy as a genre of film that is meant to disappoint, to startle, to horrify, if only to stir us to deeper consideration and greater action.",imqf5b
g42aow6,"I like Kaufman, but I'm sad to say that I think this is his one of his lesser works. While I'm sure that I am missing some details, on the surface what we see is the janitor/Jesse Plemons coming to terms with his own failure of a life. The janitor is the older Jesse Plemons all grown up working at the high school, looking back to a fictitious moment when he was younger. Jesse Buckley (who is the best part of the film along with David Thewlis) is the janitor's ideal and beautiful constructed love object. She clearly fulfills all the intellectual requirements that such a man would desire, which are mapped onto the bookshelf in his childhood room. See her competence in many fields (textbooks etc.) and her ability to string off the essays from Pauline Kael when driving in the car. Jesse Plemons/the janitor continuously creates Jessie Buckley for himself, and he also falls into his own delusions, such as the speech taken basically word for word from A Beautiful Mind or all of the many Oklahoma scenes. There are definitely more things from the bookshelf, but I'm not going to bother with allusion searching (but do look back at the bookshelf moment if you want to get deeper into this film). The girls from the High School that he continues to see while doing his janitorial services also manage to invade his psyche. Ultimately, the janitor is unable to keep the facade going at the end of the film, which ends with his inevitable suicide after following the pig, hence the 'I'm thinking of ending things'. While probably not all of this analysis is 100% correct, the pieces do seem to fit in pretty well. So the question then is, what are we left with? Well, we get the imagination of a smart, but not brilliant, man who wasn't quite able to succeed in life. The best moment of the film is the actual realization of this truth, when Jesse Plemons breaks down in the car around an hour and twenty minutes in. Ultimately such a realization is simply too much. We're reminded of when David Thewlis says that he is looking forward to the stage of dementia when he can't even remember that he can't remember.

The issue here is that, as someone who generally ""gets it"" on the first viewing of a film most audiences find confusing, I never realized that the young woman is a fantasy. Not even once the credits rolled. I don't even know at which point I'm supposed to officially realize that. I know she speaks with the old version of Jake at the end and claims that nothing ever happened on the night they met, but the film was so focused on her supposed mental deterioration from HER perspective that I figured she was just serving as an unreliable protagonist. This except from The Guardian's analysis article sums up my feelings quite well:

""You can kinda-sorta intuit that there is a connection between the janitor and what’s happening at the time-shifting farmhouse with William Morris print wallpaper (his clothes are in the washing machine), but having the movie told, with voiceover, from the perspective of Buckley’s character, only to *actually* be from the mind of the janitor is a leap my puny mind never made.

There were times when I even felt it's some kind of thriller where Lucy's mind is being trapped/ manipulated by Jake in some weird Quantum Physics timewrap way.

As much as I like the explanation of it all now, I am undecided if a run time of this duration effectively captured Jake's misery and loneliness. A large portion of the film goes into the philosophy/ intellectual discussion space and if we did not know then that it's all Jake's monologue, then the relevance of those discussions are lost on us when they happen. In fact, it felt like a stretch and I was tempted to forward those parts.

 I haven’t seen anyone discussing this aspect, I’ve seen a lot of comments that the janitor is just fantasizing about taking a girl that he never had the nerve to speak to home to meet his mom and dad, but my impression is that the young woman, Lucy, is a personification of his diminishing lucidity as he considers the ramifications of action vs inaction.

The janitor is challenging his mind. He studied poetry. Recite me a poem, Lucy. He takes walks down memory lane with her. Remember the rotting pig, remember Tulsey Town? Remember Oklahoma? He’s trying to use these lucid moments to remember things about his life, his parents, his interests, his fears, his accomplishments, his failures. But Lucy always gets back to thinking about one thing. “I should end things before it gets too bad.”

The janitor took care of his parents as they deteriorated, but who is going to take care of him? He’ll be warehoused. Left to rot in the barn while still alive. He creates this character of lucidity, this Lucy, but can’t control it anymore. It tours through his house, his life, he catches it and has to explain what it’s seeing.

It gets confused, it gets left by itself. In an empty house or trapped in the cab of a vehicle while the janitor is off doing God-knows-what. Lucy is losing control, as well.

The janitor may not have been in control of his own life, but he at least had the illusion of control, and that is leaving him now too. Was he really a successful physicist? Maybe, maybe not. Did he really bring women home to his childhood home to meet his parents? Did he discuss art and movies and poetry with smart, young women in his youth or is it all made up and he’s dying an 80 year old virgin? Real memories and real emotions seem to be tied into this image he’s created of a young woman, but they’re all jumbled up and the truth of his past can’t be determined with any sense of confidence, just as his own image of his past can’t be trusted anymore. He’s losing it. 

Lucy can’t stay here, this isn’t where she’s supposed to be. She has something to do, but can’t remember what. No, not back to the farmhouse. Why would we ever go back to the farmhouse? But that’s the janitor’s life. She doesn’t want to go to the janitor’s school. She’s got a bad feeling going this way. Why is this route to the school a one way road?

Lucy senses what the janitor is planning, maybe they’ve been planning it together, but in secret from one another. The janitor talks about how suicide becomes the headline of the life. Even if you don’t know the poem, you still know the poet killed himself. She’s thinking of ending things. Planning to leave him. But he can’t let that happen. He’s seen what that’s like. Living in a bed, dying in a bed. No poetry, no art, no memories. No dancing down the halls. The janitor can’t let that happen, so he goes on one last trip with his lucidity, then sits in his truck on a cold, cold night.",imqf5b

6/10

I found the first act boring, the second act interesting and the third act super obvious, you figure out what's happening by at least half of the movie, and I'm so fed up with the cliché plot twist ""It was all in his head"", I probably hated it because of that, the movie is too pretentious and has little to offer at the end other than another ""It was all his imagination"" movie. Which is sad, because all the actors were really good in their roles, acting 10/10. You can also analyze the particularities of each character, of course, but if you think about it too much, they're not that deep either, they just have crazy quirks or mental illnesses, and that's it, that's the character (mainly the mother and father) or they're over the top like the blond girls. There's no real depth in the characters, other than Lucy and maybe Jake. And I say maybe because I don't think Jake is a character by himself, he's more like the context for Lucy's character (this is another different discussion).

For me:

1rst act: 3/10

2nd act: 8/10

g7031io,"I did not see the old man as a sympathetic character. What I saw was a series of versions of young women he frequently emotionally abused, was rude or controlling with them and idealized them in the relationships he had with them over his life time. Perhaps it was a number of women he was with and each time his parents aged, we were getting a new version of a new relationship played out by his same fantasy dream woman. 

I think he wanted love, desperately, but was unable to respect the women in his life in order to get the love he wanted, which tormented him because he is unable to see his own narcissistic ways. Giving the young woman a sense of her own agency while need to fulfill a role ""for him"" is a duality in an abusive relationship. She also briefly mentions, ""He doesnt beat me,"" which is a frequent justification by both victim and abuser as to why what they are experiencing is not abuse. 

In the dialogues, I feel he creates a perspective of her that seems overwhelming, maybe demanding at times or argumentative and seems to ""put him down"" yet when he attempts to put the moves on her by quoting a ""rape song"", after she explains to him the idea of coercion he immediately coerces her into making out in the car despite ""telling him 40 times he wanted to go home"". 

In the scene at the ice cream shop, the waitress has the same rash as Jake and she tells the young woman that she is ""worried for her"" and that she ""does not need to go forward."" I take this more as Jake potentially stalking the women at the shop, potentially an old girlfriend, who is warning the new woman of the damage Jake has left her with. 

In the end, the pig seems absolutely literal to me. His father did not notice ""for days"" that the pig was rotting from the underside until he turned it over. The pig is Jake, and his rehashing of this story to her is the occurrence of a red flag early on in the relationship- once Jake reveals his full picture, he is nothing more than a maggot infested pig. 

Now, this may be his own guilt for how he treated others and he is projecting his self worth into the image of a rotting pig. Or perhaps he has lived his life selfishly ignorant to what he has done and at the end, the pig informs him of the truth but it did not matter because we all go to the same place in the end. He just chose to live as a pig.

I know this movie is adapted from a psychological horror and that people feel there are a lot of details missing and that's fair enough if you expected a true to the source adaption. I believe this is an interpretation of that story which seems extremely convoluted and layered and puzzling which can leave it open to interpretation. Given the nature of Kaufman exploring the male psyche in the past, I really think this was a perspective of the horrors of reality and not a mental illness or supernatural force. He was an asshole because he was an asshole, and they even discuss this at some point when he says, ""it would be nice to be able to blame it on someone"" - he wants to blame his parents for his abusive behaviors destroying his chance of love to which she responds that he is an adult and at some point just take responsibility for yourself. 

I dont think you can take this movie completely at face value as another, ""it was all in his head"". It was but it wasnt. All of those things likely happened in his life, he just retold them from his own perspective - perhaps like a high school musical or play that he was used to watching. He wanted it to be as fantastical as these scripted scenes from a play but the reality was not like that because ultimately he wanted to control the people in his life which led to his depression and isolation. He never left his parents home, he never married, he never achieved anything career wise despite an education most likely because he was just a shitty person to a lot of people and ended up taking what he could get, which was a janitor in his old high school. 

As a survivor of abuse, I guess I can find these relations a bit easier but it was actually cathartic in a way to see someone who was awful just die alone. I had no empathy for him, he was short tempered and controlling and manipulative and degrading to his mother who likely suffered some kind of mental illness he never fully understood but as many children, still felt obligated to care for them in their old age or even used this as a way to seem more endearing to women he briught home, given the dialogue the young woman says before the trippy stair sequence about how good he is for taking care of his parents.

g42tade,"
My take on the film is that it tries to portray time as perceived by our subconscious in the most accurate way possible. 
There are 4 storylines/realities/layers:

1. The Young Woman and Jake traveling to his parents; where the characters live through the events as if everything was normal and where Y.W. Is convinced “things are gonna be over”
2. The Janitor contemplating his life; where a man goes through his entire life story and finds a reason to live
3. The Young Woman trying to make sense of it all; a mixture of the two, a figment of imagination that tries to make sense of the events and the people around her to understand whether “things really need to end”.
4. An External layer, the Film itself, where Kaufman uses the situations and dynamics presented by the story to indulge in various reflections on life and the human experience.

The first layer portrays the Janitor already convinced he has no reason to live. He conjures this fake girlfriend that is made of all the girls he never had the courage to approach and forces her on a trip throughout his memories. The Young Woman is an entirely different persona created to have an external outlook on himself. He imagines what “the perfect love of his life” would think or say about his existence; but this journey is constantly contaminated by external inputs and emotional responses. 
He sees a swing outside his house and it appears in his imagination, distracting the conversation. Meanwhile, his Younger counterpart and the Young Woman make all kinds of digressions on art and poetry. This is, in my opinion, the strongest focal point of Kaufman’s tale; that the Janitor wasn’t just a man without hope or talent, but a cultivated, artistic soul who couldn’t find anything good about himself. 
Maybe the parents had something to do with it (“There comes a moment in every adult’s life where they have to take responsibility for who they are”) or maybe that was just how his life turned out.
There’s very little inside the plot that can help us make sense of Jake’s real life. We never know what’s his fantasy self job, his parents are constantly switching between different attitudes and he never takes an actual position on almost any argument.
His basement is the only non-place where actual references to his real life can be found: Janitor suits and paintings.
The Future Jake and the Past Jake, locked away from the inner world of Janitor and out of reach from Younger Jake. 

Jake’s Parents are both criticism and warped perceptions of the real parents. They’re overbearing, dumb and delusional when introduced, but they constantly switch attitudes whenever it suits Jake. 
Father begins as Dumb, so it can be used as an excuse for jake’s artistic failures (“Why is it supposed to look sad if there’s no one looking sad in it?”) and Mother as Awkward and Constantly under the thumb of her son. Then, Young Woman is reduced to a sexist variation: nothing but a waitress like in the fake Zemeckis movie, that is subservient to the family and Jake’s view of how his parents would want his girlfriend to be. 
After that the parents slip away from Jake’s control. His father turns nasty and inappropriate with his girlfriend. His mother returns to her glory days and complains about life with “little Jake”, going as far as directing young Woman to the basement.
When we catch the parents again, they’re both reduced as older versions of themselves, cared by Jake and his desire to look like a good son to Young Woman.
We probably only get a sliver of real Father when he awkwardly hugs Young Woman, a man that was loving but didn’t know how to express his feelings to his son.

At this point, Young Woman has received several phone calls from contacts that bear her constantly changing name: the Janitor reminding her of her purpose in the story.
Jake eventually decides to leave but Y.W. begins to act as she KNOWS she’s not real but living inside Jake’s world. Her sense of self becomes slippery, she changes accents, is played by another actress and switches attitudes toward Jake, who still doesn’t let her talk about the reality he’s escaping from: That things have to end.
They stop for something sugary, served by fantasy counterparts of people Janitor doesn’t like, placed as mere clerks in a remote place. 
The girl who serves them seems to be someone who used to be close to the Janitor, as she’s seen substituting the YW in a few shots later.
The woman serves the couple and tries to warn about something in the back; a strong chemical smell that is probably another reference to the Janitor and his cleaning products.
The woman warns YW “not to go forward” and stay there with them. Whether she was warning her of not following Jake or not going through with “ending things” is up for interpretation.

The sugary treats start to melt. Whatever distraction they could conjure between them to keep talking is coming to an end and Jake tries to keep things going by going after his real self inside the school. He’s trying to find a culprit; he doesn’t want the fantasy to finish, keeps finding reason to keep it going and now he’s trying to keep reality away from this world.
YW goes searching for him and slips away from Jake’s control. She seems to know to be just someone’s imagination and finds several containers of the milkshake; this is not the first time that Janitor has made this reflection.
What we’ve seen from the beginning might be several different instances of different realities played through Janitor’s mind to find a reason to keep going; and maybe we’re witnessing the first time where he actually gets to the end.

YW finds real Janitor and he’s unusually warm and sweet with him; he’s the real Jake and, far from Younger Jake, she tells the truth. There was never a relationship to begin with. This is all fake.
But Janitor still wants to help her get to the end and see things for what they are.
The storylines collapse into the same; the reality of the Couple and that of the Janitor, forced to witness school plays he could never take part in.
Lovers begin to live a perfect life but a Janitor (Reality) kills the Younger Jake. Now everything is lost. There is no longer a Jake that is escaping from Things.

Janitor commits suicide in his car by hypothermia and hallucinates a maggot infested pig that leads him to his final fantasy; a fantasy where his dreams and desires are the same. Taking the Nobel speech straight from A Beautiful Mind (which is present inside his bedroom) he becomes the star of his own theatre musical in a rendition of his bedroom, witnessed by all the people of his life who have aged in theatre makeup.
And he tells the worst thing of all; that his life was nothing without someone that loved him; an obsession that made him neglect everything good about himself.
The final shot shows snow covering the car with the Janitor’s body inside.
Things have ended.",imqf5b
g4iht2r,"I thought it was beautiful and tragic. I feel like, in old age we may all look back and wonder how our lives would have been different, had we talked to that one person or taken a risk.

g5c6nd2,"It's interesting to see that lots of people (men and women alike) find themselves relating to the loneliness of the Jake/Janitor character. For me, his psychosis is so stereotypically male that it's interesting that women are saying they feel the same.

I posted this as a reply a little further down:

""I think Jake's/the janitor's constant worrying about being perceived as a ""creep"" , ""rapey"" is a uniquely male experience. Think of Lucy's cruel rant about how he's just a mosquito who couldn't respect her space. That's male neurosis on how women see them, 100%.""

I think actually Jake's psychosis is at its core completely caused by his inability to talk to women. Starting with his bizarre relationship with his mother and proceeding through a succession of ""Lucy""s, "" Louise""s and ""Amy""s all of whom are cleverer than him, disdain him and squirm in his presence.",imqf5b

I actually would have very much have seen the film take that horror/slasher feeling turn that the book did, even though I didn’t like that part in the book so much. If that makes sense. 

It was the same for the movie. I enjoyed the things Kaufman did with his adaptation of the book, constantly imbuing the lead actress with different talents and personalities to see Jake’s thought process on trying to find a personality that would be a match with his and always failing. My personal favorite was her taking on the personality of film critic Pauline Kael (one of the books in his childhood bedroom, of course).

g464blv,"The movie seems not very thematically related to the book. From Kaufman's interviews, it definitely seems like he was interested in the book for very formal, technical reasons. It has few characters and is very minimal in its set locations. From there, Kaufman builds up a world not so much of Jake's loneliness or mental illness but of the total mediation of life by images, motifs, and fragments of social products and comments on those products. The reference to Debord is pretty key here.

In the end, the film ends up being less about the impossibility of Jake's fantasy and more about the impossibility of the form of a fantasy that belonged to a previous century. Here, film seemed to directly provide the sense for our experience--Jakes obsession with Oklahoma as an archetype for instance. But that mediation by culture itself enters into a crisis by the reflection of culture in on itself. The scathing review of A Woman Under the Influence (a film that marks the end of an era of film Jake would have grown up with) is a turning point. The recitation of the ""Baby It's Cold Outside"" controversy brings us up to our current time. The fantasy Jake has created which was sourced from popular culture has reflected and turned in on itself and against the dreamer.

The film also felt like meta-commentary on Kaufmann himself. The fantasies of Adaptation, the recursive formal nature of love in Eternal Sunshine, the inseparable relation of personal life and cultural objects of Synecdoche.",imqf5b

So as much as his art is his gift, it pains him, which they talk about how a painting can have pain without people. So he grows up, gets out, and marries someone. He’s successful. Then later in life he begins to start to get early set dementia (based on at dinner they talk about genetics and one in a million, so their dementia gene would pass to him) and he became like his parents. He killed his wife in the snow (ballet scene) which essentially killed his life. He burns down his house to hide the evidence. Maybe even his wife has a miscarriage or something where he loses it (pig with maggots). He gets caught and goes to jail. A billion years later he gets out of jail crazier than ever. The only job he can get is a janitor because of his record. All the students look at him because they know the rumors (because he doesn’t really do anything bad to them at school to make them give him dirty looks).

g4kimqw,"Honestly, read the book. I read it in a day and it’s probably my favorite reading experience ever. I would be very disappointed if I were Iain Reid.

There is a cop/detective narrative weaved between each chapter that I thought was essential (for some reason that was cut). The publisher insisted on this narrative being in the book (it was not in the original manuscript) to bring some sense of grounding to the story.

The movie was nonsense and trash in my opinion. Went from being art to random shock value quickly. The book has no musical, no naked man. The song is also an old country western tune (not Oklahoma), and has a twisted way of reflecting the character’s thoughts.

The characters are also switched in the book - the male is generally the one who rambles to the point of annoyance. The female is generally very quiet, and not nearly as cynical. She’s also being followed and creeped on throughout.

The biggest change to me, which was the main appeal of the book, was that the last half took place entirely inside the school. It was a *very intense* man hunt from the janitor who is trying to trap and capture the couple.

When the book ended I stared at the wall for 5 minutes, it just hits you and you rethink everything you just read. The whole book has you debating whether the title refers to ending a relationship or suicidal. I don’t think the book have you that eeriness that stemmed from the title.

The movie leaves you thinking “wtf?” but out of pure shock value. It didn’t provoke thought the same way the book did.",imqf5b

g429dfb,"It’s definitely not the best Charlie Kaufman film, but the more I sit with it, since I turned it on directly at the midnight release, the more I like it. The 4 major performances, the mystery, the awkward creepiness is amazing. The aging makeup on Toni Collet and David Thewlis is amazing, and at the bare minimum of awards contention, the makeup deserves to be the frontrunner. 

Charlie makes a smart choice to not follow the book to a complete T, but the interpretive dance doesn’t seem to be as good as the original way it was told in the book. That’s really my only flaw with it though, and is nothing that a quick plot summary reading of the novel can’t fix. I really love that a lot of the movie seems to be playing out in real time, with the very realistic 20 minute commute at the beginning, and all to painfully real. 

Just as other Kaufman movies do for me, I think it will only get better with more viewings.",imqf5b
g42i2pu,"I so want to give this a perfect score, and honestly I might anyway just for its artistic merit and it's possibly the most singularly original film of the year. And when it's on its streak, it's a flat out masterpiece.

The only thing holding it back is the second driving sequence, and with all that goes down in the book's ending, I wanted more of that instead of an extended dance sequence (that I still loved on its own). 

So I'm conflicted. Need to re-watch it this weekend. It's really not hard to understand at all if you read the book first, not saying that to be pretentious, but most of what the film doesn't explain makes perfect sense in the novel. 

So, the first hour is a flawless masterpiece and some of the best work of Kaufman's career, as well as an excellent adaptation of the novel without being word for word. 

The second half (or once they leave the house) is when the pacing kind of goes out the window, and some of Kaufman's indulgences/additions don't really add much to the story other than adding to the strange atmosphere (like the woman under the influence review verbatim, can someone explain why we needed that?) It's only when they make their stops where the story finally gets going again and then it's back to being great. 

So first hour- 5/5

I feel so much like the janitor, so insecure and awkward. But what hit hardest was the protagonists line about how Jake just wanted a girl who was respected so that other people would respect him.

It is all in his head, so we can ascertain that this is how he views himself, which is, I assume, why he was thinking of, well, ending things.

By the end I really felt bad for the guy: no friends, girls finding him creepy, a nice but clueless dad, an exasperated mother and a low wage job as a janitor in the same school where he was bullied.

Plemons is continuing his streak of choosing roles in spectacular movies, it's scary to think he's only 32!

Charlie Kaufman is a madman. A day spent inside his brain would kill me. I don't know what he does on a daily basis, at this point I don't want to. Perhaps his movies are overwhelming on a first watch as you try to grasp what he's going for, yet that's the magic of a Kaufman film. Nothing but hits from my man Charlie.",imqf5b
g4540i8,"Kaufman is the Radiohead of filmmaking. Was an easy 9/10 on first watch that I think now is a ten. I’m not sure how I’d rank it with his other tens, probably like;

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (all time favorite movie and score)

Synecdoche New York 

Being John Malkovich

I’m Thinking of Ending Things

Anomalisa 

Adaptation 
 

This isn’t a challenging watch for people who like films like Her, The Lighthouse, The Holy Mountain or Synechdoche- But I’d not recommend it to the impatient

What I gathered from the movie is that this brilliant mans whole life was wasted due to social anxiety and feeling sorry for himself. He never was able to meet the people he wanted or get the help he needed so he just lived it in his head. 

Also, does anyone know who sings at the end for the voice of Jake? I don’t think it’s  the original Broadway Cast?",imqf5b

If it’s that, the scene at dinner she calls herself six times (as Lucy and Louisa) with the time listed as “now” for all of the missed calls. Perhaps the remembering of his parents make him push himself closer to wanting to commit suicide. I’m not sure I can understand why the calls are from “her” and not somebody else and why she would act like it’s a friend calling and not some ominous message.",imqf5b
g46v2fe,"I love a lot of Kaufman's movies, but I found this very frustrating and ultimately didn't enjoy it. I am glad I watched it, I'm glad someine is paying Kaufman to be creative seemingly with zero concern for marketibility, and I know this will be the divisive kind of movie where people think it is genius or are irritated by it. 

Up through the dinner scene, i was really invested and felt this incredible sense of mounting dread and uncomfortableness. But after that I increasingly struggled to stay invested. Another user here said they found it hard to be invested once they realized the female lead wasn't ""real"", and I had a similar reaction to the movie: as things became more intentionally disjointed and obtuse, I felt more and more like whatever the conclusion or explanation was, none of it mattered. Maybe I am too literal of a person, but there was so little concreteness to hang all the metaphor and philosophy on that every scene was like a vignette, which made it hsrd to feel like it was building to anything. Some of the individual scenes were compelling, but even though I came away with a gist of what happened--that the janitor was Jake, that he was dying or choosing to die in the parking lot, that he had imagined a life with a girl he barely met based on what he had learned from fiction--I didn""t feel emotionally connected tk any of that, nor did I come away feeling like I'd taken in anything meaningful about any of the the topics Kaufman was discussing. When a movie is this dense, usually you need to rewatch it with more context to appreciate it more, but I don't feel like watching it again with that understanding would make me feel more satisfied with it. I found it very rambling, hard to take seriously, and purposefully obtuse. 

I wish I'd gotten more out of it, but it really just wasn't a hit for me. Technically it was brilliant and I appreciate that movies like this are being msde, but I was frustrated more than I was compelled.",imqf5b

I enjoyed this movie though, felt a little too long imo but I thought it was a really interesting take on just the shitty parts of being a person--regret, aging, watching the ones you love age, never being 100 percent certain what is going on in other people's heads and how other people perceive you, etc.

g4ikoyj,"I remember watching Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind (did I type the title correctly?) when I was about 13 yrs. I remeber thinking how amazing that movie was. I had watched it a few more times during that year, and then rewatched it in my early 20's admiring the creation of the story and the way it was directed. Felt scary how emotions, space and time intertwine. 

This movie felt scary at certain moments where certain shifts in persona or time could make you feel vulnerable...

However, the movie got confusing. One main aspect is how the film felt focused on the lady the whole time as if it was her story. With so many ""what's the mystery to solve"" types of movies I have seen, my mind was set - from pre-conceived notions - on how there is a mystery to be solved. It's building up; you think there are clues that will eventually say he is about to kill her. I mean the title says ""I'm thinking of ending things"" and the lady says it first in the film. I'm thinking because she didn't, there is regret and now she will die... I was thinking throughout the film that maybe it's a film that is rooted about the works of psychology - about a lady who suffers from her mind unable to form a bond with her liver, needing to escape (as a defence mechanism to not feel hurt?)

Talk about getting mind-fucked when you realized it is about a man's insecurity of needing to have the ideal woman but fears of losing her. Well, that is what I think it is. The comments in this reddit post helped me clarify things about the movie. But, because it felt the movie was focused on that lady's mind, I had a hard time figuring out it was all about the portrayal of the man's mind from his insecurity built from his past...Anyone with a bad experince in life can have a tough future. To have a constant battle mind os the scariest shit...

In the scene with the young woman and Jake in the car where they kiss it has a sudden cut of a shot of the janitor looking though a hole in a wall. You hear strange urgent whispers as well. Then Jake says he saw someone spying on them. 

I can’t come to an explanation that makes any sense to me. It’s dark in the shot and it’s nighttime at the school so I think there is an implication it’s something in the real world, but I don’t know. I can’t figure no matter how much I turn it over in my head.",imqf5b

g57sdz4,"I looked forward to watching this film, but it failed to live up to its trailer. The car trip to Jake's parents and the scenes at the farm are perfectly tense and creepy. The dialogue is just strang enough to keep you on the edge of your seat; always trying to figure out what's going on and where the film is trying to take you. Everything after this feels drawn out and self-indulgent.

This film's fatal flaw is how it mishandles the reveal. Kaufman said that he wasn't interested in building up to a big twist and woud rather focus on the characters' psyche. I sympathise with the motivation, but I think he overcorrected by focusing nearly exclusively on 'Young Woman' instead of the janitor. Young Woman is the protagonist of the film, so if the reveal and the ending are going to be meaningful in any way, they have to be meaningful to her. Instead she disappears as soon as Jake and the janitor merge back together. The ending seems to be completely disconnected from the rest of the film: why woud we care about the janitor if we haven't once been asked to care about him before? If anything he's the antagonist: most of the tension of the film comes from Young Woman being too afraid to end things with Jake and feeling physically trapped by him (first at the farm and then in the car.) In the book, Young Woman and the janitor 'end things' together and I think this would have been more meaningful and more cathartic for the audience. It would also have cut the runtime down like 30 minutes and that certainly wouldn't have hurt...",imqf5b
g5uoqi8,"The 2nd half if this film ruined it for me. I had already thought that they were going too hard with the abstractism and weirdness in terms of edits and unacknowledged time changes of characters/actions but stuck with it.

Then it just became a mess and seemed to boost the pretentiousness to the max without trying to tie it to any semblance of a plot.

I was expecting something akin to David Lynch meets Wes Anderson and I got something where the actors gave it their best and performed amazingly but the material they were given was disintegrating and becoming increasingly vapid the more it went on.

I'll probably get called dumb and that's OK but I didnt know this was suppose to be wholly about Jake until I read other peoples thoughts and reviews. I thought it was a tale of two individual beings who have entered a strange interwoven symbiotic tale but the woman was the dominant protagonist while the bf and his family/world was the dominant environment.

This movie definitely feels like it was made with love. So detailed and well made.

Really didn't know what was going on by the end. The musical fight sequence threw me off quite a bit. I think the theory that it all was in the head of the genitor fits like a glove.

g4oz0w5,"I wish you all would stop calling yourselves “too dumb” for either not liking it or not understanding its message. 

I have such mixed emotions about this movie. I watched it on a whim, knowing nothing about it. I didn’t even know what genre it was. The only thing I did know was that it had a high critic score and a much lower audience score, which always translates into some artsy, self-indulgent, deliberately confusing to reward critics for ‘getting it’ kind of movie.

(Spoilers ahead) I’m not sure I would classify this fully in the same class as above, although it definitely walks the line. I was completely captivated all the way until they reached the high school, then I was flat out disappointed. There were so many directions it could have gone, and the direction they chose was seemingly the most unsatisfying of them all. We spend the whole movie seeing and hearing from the girl’s perspective, only to realize it’s not about her at all, and that she (or at least her role is Jake’s life) is a figment of his imagination. That he’s a sad, old janitor contemplating suicide, probably huffing fumes (I’d assume that’s what the whole varnish bit at the ice cream shop was about?) and trying to get hypothermia. Up until the end, we’re left with far more questions than answers. That doesn’t make for a great viewing experience. I even paused the movie during the interpretive dance to check how much time was left (thinking there’s no way they’re going to wrap this up).

Someone else wrote that this movie is much more fun to think about than it was to watch. I couldn’t agree more. I was flat out annoyed watching the final third of it and thought it was pretentious, deliberately obfuscated, weird for the sake of being weird garbage (right about the time the interpretive dance started). Yet here I sit today, still thinking about it, admiring the more clever aspects of it, and thinking it is a prime rewatch candidate. Any movie with that power is worth the price of admission.",imqf5b

g42r6ci,"First off, the only other Kaufman movie I saw was Being John Malkovich, which I saw for the first time yesterday. Hope this helps with my perspective on this.

I have a lot of mixed feelings about this movie. The dialogue and visuals are amazing. All the scenes with the two leads in the car are absolutely fantastic and were really fascinating to watch. They both give A+ performances and I loved it. Then when they get to the home and everything is just so fucking off, but in a very interesting way to watch. The dinner scene was the obvious highlight for me, and there was also some beautiful shots during this. I really enjoyed watching this movie for those things. 

As for what the hell was going on, that is when the film starts to disappoint me. I caught on that the Janitor and Jake are the same person, that was clued in pretty seamlessly if you're paying attention. And the fact that the girlfriend doesn't respond to some of the surrealism, like the constant aging, let me think something was really off, like she was in a hospital and was having dementia or another disease like that, which was mentioned in the movie as well. Something similar to Time's Arrow from Bojack Horseman. Then the movie kept going and I thought maybe it was Jake who was having issues. Some of their dialogue alluded to this, which once again the car scenes were my favorite part of it.

Then we got to the end and I was waiting so patiently for the shoe to drop, just to kind of wrap everything up. I don't need like everything spelled out, but I just needed like one thing that would make everything click. I think the movie tried it when the girl explained to the Janitor how she never actually met Jake, but on first watch it went over my head. At this point it was the 3rd time her story changed, and right after she said she was going to go look for Jake. Instead we got a very nice dance scene and a very weird ceremony/play right after Janitor Jake walks around the hallways naked. I think he died but only because it was the end of the movie at that point. 

I read online what was going on, and that everything was in his head. And I just felt like...sure that does make sense but it isn't super satisfying. The aesthetics and characters in this movie are stellar and I loved watching it, but I do wish it just made things a little clearer at the end.

That was heartbreaking stuff. Watching Plemons trying to feed her in that bed... my god that was some soul shattering work. Very similar vibes to what Scorsese was doing in the back half of *Irishman*. I love films that meditate on aging and the pain it spreads all around. “Wife shaped loneliness,” what a stunning line. 

It lost me in the second half but I think that was because I wasn’t connecting the dots. I knew nothing of this story and my mind just couldn’t understand the intentions behind the character.

I watched this in the context of currently being in the exact same state of ""Thinking About Ending Things"" as the protagonist and I really REALLY connected these exaggerated instances. I'm really disappointed to hear that this is all the janitor's fantasy? Like that sounds so dull. Lonely men glorify their past relationships, I mean yeah?

But the way I initially indulged in this film was that this film is nothing but Thoughts. And the nucleus of her thinking in all of these moments and in every situation is: I'm Thinking About Ending Things. It's an ode to the urging feeling to leave someone with no action upon these thoughts and the decision your emotions have already made. It is the many trains of thought that mould and intersect into each other and reform amidst the emotional limbo between decision and action. I love that there is no reason to leave her relationship apart from this feeling she has that she is thinking about ending things all the time. This movie recognises that the process of thinking and the concept of thought is so constantly unfinished, that there is no justified cause to take action just yet. The result of this forever delayed ending of a relationship is being permanently stuck in exploring the nuanced variables of making that very decision. Swirling between distance, distain, dramatic victimising anger, worry, blind care, bubbling love, uneasiness. This is an unfinished film of unfinished moments and instances and thoughts because this film is a culmination of simply and only Thinking About Ending Things.",imqf5b

I went into _I'm Thinking of Ending Things_ neither having read the source material nor having seen any of Charlie Kaufman's other works (I know, I know).

I thought it was SO clever how it all unfolded like a fuzzy memory that needed prompting...like Jimmy phasing in and out of existence when needed (the urn was a nice touch) and the camera panning to the living room and record player before the characters, as Jake needed time to recall those details. 

There was just one thing I picked up on which appears not to be the case at all, and that's Jake's potential homosexuality. I feel like the clues are all there. Jake's Dad using a homophobic slur at one point, perhaps signifying a household that was very hard to 'come out' in; he and Lucy discussing being gay in the car; followed swiftly by the encounter with the high-school bullies who say something like ""two of the same"" while staring at Jake and snickering. I even wondered whether perhaps Jake always longed to be female (which I know is a separate issue) and Lucy was his desired self, hence the childhood photo flitting from girl to boy.

g4by1ua,"Re: ""Lucy""/the woman, I actually took her as a symbol of many different women in Jake's life, as well as an extension of Jake himself. That's why she changes names and accents and backstories. Jake brings these women from his attempts at an escape home, but they escape him, leaving him behind until he's a lonely janitor. I think that the movie-within-a-movie we watched might have been, in fact, another memory. Notice she has one of the woman's names, and is a waitress. She also holds his hand in a sort of resigned forgiveness, another doomed relationship beginning. Maybe Jake feels these people stayed with him because they knew he meant well, and tried to make it work, yet it never did. Or it did, but they weren't happy. Is this true? Who knows. Another comment supposed all the calls were his ""real"" wife frantically trying to reach him.

I found Tulsey Town interesting. It's built up as a sort of amazing ice cream store, but in reality it seems to be a roadside ice cream stand. Then in the end, we are shown a 1950's-era ad for it where it's once again a magical place. Did Tulsey Town turn into something smaller and sadder over time? Or was it always lackluster and miserable, something Jake realized as he came into adulthood?

I also notice that his father had Alzheimer's. Perhaps Jake is dealing with this as well, which would further explain the confusing memories and sequences. In fact, if viewed as a movie about aging and dementia, then it is a masterpiece in my opinion.",imqf5b

This movie punishes you with metaphors and small changes that almost make you question your own sanity.

Must make him want to relive some fantasy after seeing and hearing kids with futures ahead and love to be had where as he will never get to have that mystery again.

I was on the fence of whether I thought I liked this movie because I thought that I should because it seems clever, or if I should not like it because it’s trying to be too clever. But I can’t often sit through movies but the dialogue hooked me in even though I didn’t really know what was going on at the time. When it got to the scene in the high school it all clicked into place (later than some). Still took some unraveling mentally but that was fun to do which I don’t often get from movies.

Also really like the idea that Television and movies not are a way in which is we see the world which then in turns creates a world and society. You can see that with all the bat shit crazy people you see ranting on all social media’s in supermarkets and stuff. Now that we see it and know if it, it becomes almost normal to have these things happen, we expect chaos because it’s what we watch through the lens of camera phones. Idk good movie.",imqf5b
g4pdpc1,"Never read the book, but saw the trailer and thought it was going to be scary having watched the visit recently and thought it might be along those lines. One of those ""something is disturbingly wrong under this normal looking life"". Of course it was just that, but different than how I thought it was going to be, so I of course went in thinking the worst was going to happen and on edge waiting for a jump scare and the tension. What I found was, in fact terrifying and just a total sense of unease throughout which left me satisfied in the unease tense sense but in a completely different way. Maybe some of you felt this too. 
   
  The title was of course immediately in my mind about suicide. Never did it cross my mind that she was talking about breaking up until she was in the car looking out the window and I thought, well, maybe but, no that can't be right. Therefore because of this I imagined she was already dead, just reliving this point in time. When I finally got to the end of the movie, I'm waiting for it to keep going, feeling unsatisfied. Confused, but trying to piece it all together for actually quite a while for the next day and night, this movie was constantly on my mind, and I just kept repeating it all back in my head over and over so much so that I dreamt just as unsettling dreams all night. 

   The piecing of it all together and really understanding what I just watched and that ""aha"" moment, where it finally makes sense was very satisfying to me and going from me wondering what the hell I just watched to, wow, that really hit home so damn hard in so many ways and, wow, that movie was genus. The attention to detail in the film was my favorite because I love finding things like that in movies. Subtle, and also in your face details that really make it enjoyable. The changing of their clothes, the changes in the car such as the seat she is sitting in changing back and forth from the car to the truck, the unfastened seat belts, the view out the window from a standstill to moving, or the amount of snow on the windows. I really wanted to discuss the details more than anything because I was just fascinated with them and it is what really made the film stand out for me. Also the fact that I have contemplated suicide and that I watched both my parents die at young ages so the feeding of his mother really struck hard with me. 

   All in all I enjoyed it, but what I really wanted to say is that I didn't realise how much I truly enjoyed it until seriously reliving/rewatching it in my head.",imqf5b
g4r069d,"I'm glad this thread is full of interpretations that actually fit the movie because I suck at figuring this sort of stuff out while watching and usually tend to be completely wrong. Which is exactly what happened this time.

The fact that we're introduced to the woman first, that we hear her thoughts and literally look into the camera several times in the car gave me the impression she was the main character and I kept thinking that for the majority of the film. The details of everything constantly shifting and things not making sense made me believe that she was having a dream about her unhappiness with her relationship that would at some point turn into a nightmare. Mainly because we hear her think the titular line several times.

It wasn't until the very end that I realized Jake and the janitor are the same person and I believed the movie is about Alzheimers and that's why the details all don't line up and his memories are all flowing into each other or get vague. Turns out that that wasn't exactly what was going on either.",imqf5b

I do completely understand how people can enjoy films like this though. It's one big pile of symbolism, open to interpretation, and an end that screams ""alright, I've handed you all the puzzle pieces,  have fun creating your own narrative"".

I feel the film made me care about the wrong person, namely the girl. The focal point of the film is a girl >!that turns out to be an impossible character. To what degree she was real, imaginary or an amalgamation of experiences with various girls is up for grabs, as almost everything in the film is.

g5ow0f7,"I don’t watch many films like this, or at all really, but I really liked it. Even if the first watch I didn’t understand it, I was still interested in each moment. There are lots of things that nicely tie together that you can discover on your own or read about online: the cups suggesting he’s done this many times (reminded me of Triangle) , the radio quoting the bible about sin being white as snow, the little inconsistencies that make it dreamlike, etc. And then the ones that I still don’t understand. But I think I’d like it less if I understood it all. The dialogues (monologues?) in the car can drag on a bit, and my brain visually really wanted to see something different other than the car and that endless snow, but I’m sure the guy did too. 

One question I had is, why her? The old janitor revisits this time in his life, with her, over and over. and even though it was a random encounter that went nowhere, she never got replaced with anyone else. No other random people he saw since, to invent a new story? It’s not even like he knows anything about her to make her special, her traits are copied from his own life or misremembered each time. maybe the question is not why her, but why then? Maybe that’s when he really gave up and the next 40 years was just his life playing itself out from there.

g4gr2db,"i'm thinking of turning off this movie

My issue with ITOET might be unique but I still think it's valid. Early on I figured the film to be about the troubles of staying in a relationship too long, losing individuality, the dangers of inaction, allowing time to pass, and gaslighting all through the lens of the woman. I was wrong but right enough to never really be sure until late in the film. By the time I realized everything was about Jake's escapism I was saddened to have wasted empathy on a fictional fictional character. 


There's also a number of horror movie tropes (snowstorm, bad relationship, dead farm animals, basement door) that I was worried for Jessie Buckly's well being, these never pay off. 

I respect the meta of the film. You don't need to see someone being sad to know it's a sad painting but I could've used a little more hand holding.

That Jake was using the idea of a woman to justify his own life's actions, gaslighting her existence to fit his own desires and ease his guilts. 

Lo and behold upon reading an explanation interview I learned that it was the director bending the idea of a woman into the utilitarian shape he needed to make his story complete. 

It took the film from poignant to masturbatory and I officially hate it.

Edit: after reading through this thread I'm wondering: did no one else see Jake flailing in attempt to vindicate himself of rape or else sexual cohersion? I saw several hints at his own controlling behavior towards Lucy, whether she was imagined by him or not. Even in his internal dance, the youthful, hopeful self cannot enter into marriage with Lucy because the janitor self takes her against her will. She often calls him out for a misogynistic attitude. Even after he apologizes for the Baby It's Cold Outside reference - he still uses emotional manipulation to get a kiss from her. Then we see a lucid janitor voyeur for only a moment before the idealized self takes over again. This is the confrontation of self that instigates the climax of the movie. Jake cannot erase or face his views towards women. The idealized self disappears and the true delusional self's journey begins. 

If this was intentional direction, I take back my hatred.

But since I have a frail heart, I appreciated it. I still adore it though. The references, the dinner scene, the dance in the end, and the score - are simply amazing.

Jessie Buckley's performance in this, is sublime. If Rene Zellweger can win an oscar for a below average biopic about Judy Garland. Then Jessie certainly deserves a nomination. Her delivery and her subtle facial expressions while everything just gets weirder around her. The face she makes when she finally musters the courage to say - I'm thinking of ending - to just be interrupted with Tulsey Town. Is akin to Joaquin Phoenix's acting in the Master. I won't be surpised if she was inspired by him since she is a PTA fan (the joy it'll bring me if they work together). Well, at least from what I've heard from her past press tours.

g45ekdr,"For the first hour or so I thought this was a meditation on relationships. I thought the convoluted flow of time (praise the sun) in the house was meant to explore how when you spend a life with someone you might only see their parents once or twice a year. Every time you see them they’re older and before you know it their faculties are fading and eventually they pass away. You know these people for decades but might only spend a combined total of a day or two with them. The time jumps coupled with her saying “we need to leave” made me think of someone who spent years in an unhappy relationship, contemplating leaving but getting dragged further and further into this family. Or, it was all just her imagining her future if she stayed with this guy.   

The surreal and unnerving weirdness of their dinner conversation felt like an exaggerated depiction of the anxiety, self-consciousness, and awkwardness people like myself feel when meeting a partner’s parents for the first time. As for the flashes of the janitor, I thought these were about the girl (forget her name) picturing what the future had in store for Jake. Which seems fitting since she’s meeting his parents for the first time and thinking about leaving him. At the same time I also felt they were actually depicting a future Jake looking back on these memories. So sort of a duality there.   

Basically it seemed like a movie about relationships and the rapid passage of time. All wrapped up in commentary about the artificial depiction of relationships in conventional Hollywood films, and cultural pressures we all feel to “win” someone. But then the movie kept going and a different meaning came into play, with this all being some sort of fabrication of Jake’s mind that I guess you could argue still touches on everything’s just mentioned. Anyhow, I did not enjoy this movie. It was at times intriguing and unnerving. But I was mostly bored. And the monologues drove me a little crazy. The whole house sequence was my favorite part. I really loved the look and tone of this movie. It was haunting and unnerving. Great performances, too. It just got a little too lost in its symbolism for my tastes.",imqf5b
g45v1m4,"I think my opinion on Kauffman is that I wish he would like try evening out a little as a writer/director by sticking to something a tad more coherent for once.

If this movie HAD been more committed (or at all)  a ""horror"" movie, maybe it would have actually been psychologically scary.  I dunno who decided to label the movie as ""horror."" I think that was one thing I didn't like about it, waiting for any horror to start.

If there was anything else in it even remotely as funny as the Zemeckis joke (hilarious, watched it twice - and I don't even get fully why it's there), maybe it would have been funny. Or it could have been funny and scary. Instead it was just a mess.

I don't hate the movie... after seeing some people online talking about the book, I just went and read it last night/today. It's short and it's more ""horror"" than the movie. I liked it much better. It's a lot different and has some fantastic writing. But even it gets mind-fucky in a way that's a bit annoyingly dense (must have been what Kauffman responded to) - though not as much as the movie.

I just find the movie kind of pretentious and a bit boring I guess. I like weird movies but more so when there's something there that makes me feel like it's warranted and more artful, and not just the filmmaker stroking himself off. Though that said, I love like 'Mulholland Drive' and if someone else hates it for being ""weird"" and pretentious and ""boring"" I kind of get it.

g43jmz4,"SPOILERS BELOW

I LOVE Kaufman’s movies. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of my favourites ever, Anomalisa is probably my favourite movie of that year, and I really liked Synechoche New York as well. I think he captures emotions and themes of death, age, and time better than almost any director working today. There’s a certain sense of delicacy and patience to his movies that just stick with me everytime I watch, or rewatch, one of them.

But, that being said, this is the most conflicted I’ve ever been on a movie. 

The first half had me absolutely hooked and excited to see where it was going. Jessie Buckley’s performance was so great and I loved the style of writing. especially with the parts of two main characters conversing. Toni Collette and David Thewlis were absolutely incredible, and honestly I think Collette should get a supporting actress nod. I thought the dinner scene was absolutely hilarious and uncomfortable to watch, and made me feel so tense and curious to where it would go next. I knew that Kaufman would twist it into something else and I was excited to see how he would do it.

Unfortunately, and I hate to say it, the rest of it fell completely flat for me as it took everything I liked about the first half and just stretched it for too long and too thinly. Having not read the book, I had a slight theory that all 4 characters were the same person going through some kind of time loop, and since the majority of them (particularly Jesse Plemons’ character and his parents) were getting details wrong about certain things, it would tie into a story about aging, memory, dementia etc. While there are definitely those themes evident in the movie, where the story went after the main characters left the house is such a sudden dip in quality.

The great writing he had in the drive up to the parents house was nowhere to be seen and the exploration of time within the house felt tense but inconsequential. I WANTED to feel something, but I was just confused (obviously).  Strangely enough, I found the more relatively surface-level, immediately rewarding elements of the movie to be the best, which is something I thought I’d never say about one of his movies. 

All tension was lost for me, and the conversations they had in the car nearly put me to sleep. It felt like Kaufman was just listing off some of his big influences for the characters (again, I haven’t read the book, so they may have played a more clear role in the source material), with no real connection to anything else. 

I understand that the movie really took place in the janitor’s head, and that it was all essentially imagined by the janitor (being an older version of Jake), which made things a bit more clear. But even though about 75% of this movie’s details and plot points went directly over my head, I have almost no desire to truly find out what they meant because they were expressed in such a disconnected fashion. 

I hate to do this because again, I love Charlie Kaufman’s work and his style of writing, but I personally give it a 5/10. I still cannot wait to see what he does next, and I commend him for presenting such a bold, brave, COMPLETELY unique vision, but almost none of it stuck with me at all. Maybe I’ll
enjoy it more on a rewatch, who knows.",imqf5b
g47d96s,"I liked it when it was an unnerving and surreal commentary on dying relationships. Once the naked elderly man started following a cartoon pig around, I basically checked out. The last 30 minutes of this completely disappeared up its own ass and I challenge anyone to explain the meaning with a straight face.",imqf5b
g47smpq," It starts as a treatise on relationships, with a girl thinking of breaking up with her boyfriend during a long car ride to meet his parents. It’s intriguing enough as her thought process is relatable. Then it dramatically shifts gears as they arrive and reality-bending stuff starts to happen during an awkward and creepy dinner scene featuring a fun performance from Toni Collette. It’s by far the best part of the movie because it’s well made, well acted, it has an atmosphere approaching horror, and at this point the viewer still expects a good twisty movie to come out of this. But then the couple hop in the car once more and what follows are endless ruminations and lofty monologues on a variety of unrelated pretentious topics, all shot in the same three camera angles, in the same grayish snowstorm scenery, and occasionally peppered with strange occurrences that will never be explained and will never have a discernible purpose. And one dance number later, the movie is over, none of it mattered and Kaufman is smarter than us.",imqf5b
g4egclb,"So I watched this a second time, a lot slower and pausing and rewinding to get missed details. I also watched a good explanation video which I’ll link below for those interested.

- “Lucy” or the girlfriend is an extension of Jake’s consciousness, that’s why the baby picture in the house changes between her and Jake and she sees her art in the basement. Also why her name and clothing change so much.

- The phone calls are from a Lucy, Yvonne, and Louisa which are all separate contacts ringing to the girlfriend’s phone which is actually the women Jake was in love with at various points of his life that he was too afraid to ask out. 

- He comes from a troubled home. He’s around a lot of death on the farm and he tells Lucy about the pig that was neglected by his father and died (throughout the movie Jake is characterized as the pig). This shows that Jake’s father never accepted anything he did or showed any affection a la the awkward handshake when they first arrived, the criticism towards Lucy’s art, the awkward hug with Lucy, his parents saying he won the diligence pin because he was hardworking not because he was smart. Jake’s parents fought a lot, but his mother was the more loving one. His mother eventually died of alzhiemers or dementia (father said he loved mom’s humor but that faded as she aged and he said he missed her when the mom was dying and Lucy and Jake were leaving.)

- The basement signifies Jake’s childhood trauma, regret, and fears which is why it looks beaten and concealed. The mother tells Lucy that Jake is always nervous and would never go in the basement, she tells Lucy to live a little and go in there.


- (this is my idea) The dog, we see the ashes in the urn for Jimmy in Jake’s bedroom. Lucy says she likes the dog but Jake apologized for the smell. This is because the dog is dead.

- The interpretive dance scene illustrates Jake’s fantasy life. It’s theatrical and soft music is playing when young Jake is dancing with Lucy. The janitor then comes in to stab young Jake signifying that he killed the hopes and dreams he had when he was younger as he was too afraid to live his life.

- Jake is a caretaker to his parents the same way he’s a caretaker of the school. When he follows the pig, we see the scar on his chest in the same place the actor Jake was stabbed. The pig leads Jake to the auditorium where another Jake accepts a Nobel prize for his life’s work in front of his high school class. He desired to be recognized and performed a song from Oklahoma, his favorite musical which is referenced throughout. The scene turns blue and we see the car covered in snow, which meant Jake died of hypothermia.

- When Lucy meets janitor Jake, she detached herself from Jake’s consciousness and remembers that she did not have a relationship with Jake and that he was just a weird guy staring at her (in the beginning of the film we see janitor Jake looking out the window at Lucy as she gets in Jake’s car). 

- The girls from Tulsi town are Jake’s peers who ridiculed him throughout high school. 

- (my own idea) The girl with the rash confuses me. I think she’s Lucy’s real girlfriend which explains why Lucy said she went out with her girlfriend to celebrate their anniversary when Jake’s parents asked how they met. The rash girl thinks Lucy is pretty and Lucy recognizes her from somewhere. It’s possible they both went to the same high school and dated later or were just friends. The rash girl also apologizes for the smell. Now this could mean that like Jake, she is dead. If Lucy is not real at all, even outside of Jake’s consciousness, then it’s likely the rash girl empathizes with Jake because she’s one of the ones Jake said was depressed at the school. I think the latter possibility makes more sense.

- The swingset, Tulsi Town, and the show Jake was watching represent things that brought him comfort and gave him the hope to keep living.

*Bonedog*

Coming home is terrible

whether the dogs lick your face or not;

whether you have a wife

or just a wife-shaped loneliness waiting for you.


--


Coming home is terribly lonely,

so that you think

of the oppressive barometric pressure

back where you have just come from

with fondness,

because everything’s worse

once you’re home.

--

You think of the vermin

clinging to the grass stalks,

long hours on the road,

roadside assistance and ice creams,

and the peculiar shapes of

certain clouds and silences

with longing because you did not want to return.

Coming home is

just awful.


--


And the home-style silences and clouds

contribute to nothing

but the general malaise.

Clouds, such as they are,

are in fact suspect,

and made from a different material

than those you left behind.

You yourself were cut

from a different cloudy cloth,

returned,

remaindered,

ill-met by moonlight,

unhappy to be back,

slack in all the wrong spots,

seamy suit of clothes

dishrag-ratty, worn.


--


You return home

moon-landed, foreign;

the Earth’s gravitational pull

an effort now redoubled,

dragging your shoelaces loose

and your shoulders

etching deeper the stanza

of worry on your forehead.

You return home deepened,

a parched well linked to tomorrow

by a frail strand of…


--


Anyway…

You sigh into the onslaught of identical days.

One might as well, at a time...

--

Well…

Anyway…

You’re back.

--


The sun goes up and down

like a tired whore,

the weather immobile

like a broken limb

while you just keep getting older.

Nothing moves but

the shifting tides of salt in your body.

Your vision blears.

You carry your weather with you,

the big blue whale,

a skeletal darkness.


--

You come back

with X-ray vision.

Your eyes have become a hunger.

You come home with your mutant gifts

to a house of bone.

Everything you see now,

all of it:

bone.

I got that Jake was the Janitor but what I didn't get was that the time skips and delusions were of his own fantasies and imagination. I figured these were just splashes of real moments being interjected into a linear timeline. Like oh here's a flash of his mother on her deathbed, his dad losing his mind, etc. I think what really threw me off was how the girl feels like the main character. Both from the advertising and marketing but also through the dialogue and story. It's supposed to be about how she's ending things with him but they were never a thing to begin with and it's instead about how he's ending things with existence.  The play they're referencing is supposed to tip you off that it's a lot more so about being the unlikable unredeemable one and ultimately ending up dead, but having no idea about the play this too is unhelpful.

I feel pointlessly conned, the revelation after I finished is not rewarding, it just feels like wasted time. I don't know what Kaufman wants us to think with these bait and switch style plots? The idea is interesting, it's shot well, acted well but why force your viewers to either, pay close enough attention to figure it out on the first go or watch it again?

It's clever, it's very clever. But I just don't know when I will ever feel compelled to watch it again. Synecdoche and Anomalisa I had 0 problems with, they were great, this... it just felt like a huge missed opportunity.",imqf5b

First half of the movie was really unsettling and kept me engaged. Second half of the movie began to get annoying to me when Lucy was trying to get home and Jake wouldn't go home. I was wondering if them driving was about to get drawn out for an hour because Jake refused to go home. I thought the last 20 minutes were horrendous and here's why.

I noticed changes in the characters throughout the movie, like the dad's bandaid changing sides on his head, Lucy's overcoat changed colors numerous times, then her dress, then her sweater, and I thought there was going to be some weird time-warp reveal especially because the main character wonders about it while in the car with that line about ""time passing through us"". I didn't think the big reveal was ""I made it all up"" because what a lazy idea that is. 

I thought there were a lot of unexplained things even with the reveal, but based off some comments here it seems like they were addressed more in the book but Kaufman didn't flesh them out to completion in the movie: phone calls, scratches on door, and girl with rash and varnish excuse. Those were 3 things that were super creepy and just didn't get explained. 

I thought the actors did a phenomenal job, Kaufman created a very eerie atmosphere in the first half, but wrapping up the ending was messy and the dance made me mad lol I don't think you get to have some avant-garde dance sequence followed by a musical when the ending feels so disjointed.

g42nlbj,"I have a fundamental problem with this film.

It is beautifully crafted and acted, and for a while, quite ""thrilling"".  In particular for me, the pacing of roughly the first half was good, ramping up from quiet eery incongruities in the initial monologue and car drive, with the tension ramping up massively when we hit Joel's parents house and Lucy's character starts to shift and change inexplicably but in a way where we can't tell if she's being manipulated or if something else is at play.  However after that, once I realised this wasn't a horror film, the tension began to deflate rapidly, and once I realised Lucy wasn't real I no longer felt there were any stakes: fundamentally because I didn't care about Joel (and I struggle to see how anyone could), and don't know enough about his parents to feel much aside from a little sympathy for his mother (and a vague fear that the father is a major pervert).

The idea that Lucy is essentially a figment of Joel's imagination (based on a girl he met once in a bar) is interesting.  The trouble is, if Lucy is not real at all, then (a) what is the point of all her interactions with the mother and father, and perhaps more importantly her time alone in the house?  e.g. What indeed was the incredibly uncomfortable exchange between Lucy and the father about the nightgown...?  This is an incredibly vivid and disturbing and elaborately imagined third-party ""adventure"" for Joel to be internally coming up with.
(b) if the entire film is just the musings of Joel in his old age working as a janitor presumably after his parents have passed, Christ is that just a totally depressing bunch of musings i.e. he is not even capable of fantasising about a genuinely enjoyable experience with the woman of his literal dreams?  If not why not?  Why is he so damaged?

To dwell further on this Joel:
assuming we can trust the objects in his house and Joels interactions with other characters to be genuine reflections of reality, it seems that Joel is a somewhat widely read but extremely antisocial oddball.  He has interests in some art and poetry and *famous critical reviews of films* (which is obviously just of interest to Kaufman himself), which don't feel particularly realistic for a janitor but can be put down to being absorbed piecemeal over the years working at the school.  But who is *he*, what are his values, his strengths and weaknesses?  What is at stake for him aside from his extreme loneliness?

I'm afraid I don't recall any behaviours which reflect well on him or give me any feeling for him at all, and his temper with his mother is concerning.  Yes he does care for her and cried when she was ill/dead.  Not much else though...

However the thing that sticks out for me (which I've seen little comment on yet) is the bruising and cuts which grow over time on the dark haired ice cream store server.  Is this inflicted by Joel himself? (The bruise on his hand might suggest he bestowed these though it's very unclear).  she talks about them not varnishing out back but I cannot parse what that means... Please tell me there is another interpretation...

So, to sum up, the premise, an amalgam of fantasies into one character carried out by a single actress, which reflects on the character of the fantasiser, is very interesting.  But the implementation here is wholly dissatisfactory for me, because once the fantasy is stripped away there remains no empathetic character or struggle or stakes, aside from perhaps a hint of a true horror story lying underneath.  And fundamentally I find it horrifically depressing that this messy fantasy was what Joel found himself focussed on in his final hours.  So I have to ask... Where's the fun here?  I ended the film feeling cheated that I'd been hooked in by the tension of the first half, only to find I'd invested so much energy on something which had so little emotional core to justify my attention.",imqf5b

g43b9mx,"Weird, conflicted feelings about this. 

A lot of parts were really well executed, basically everything at the house is great. Tons of great images, like the dog that just *will not stop shaking.* The stop at the ice cream shop, the fake movie (with the hilarious cut to credits), the minor details that seem off and briefly come back up many scenes later (genus/genius, “treachery”), etc. 

This is, in some ways, the Super Smash Bros. of Kaufman’s filmography. It plays with aging and the passage of time in ways similar to Synecdoche, New York. You’ve got the Adaptation-style internal monologue. There’s some Eternal Sunshine style scenes of really ugly moments between the couple. And some very Anomalisa breakdowns in communication. But it still feels fresh for him, with a horror movie creepiness that isn’t present in his other work. Early on, it feels like it might be his take on Hereditary, complete with Toni Collette.

But man this movie gets self-indulgent whenever the couple is in that car. Obviously some very important themes and elements of the relationship come up, and the movie is interested in the idea of feeling trapped with somebody. But the first 20 minutes are almost entirely in that car! And there’s a similarly long car sequence in the second half. It’s got Hateful Eight energy in the worst way. Some of the discussions about various works of art and media add a lot, but others feel entirely up their own ass, go on for far too long, and depend on an existing knowledge of the source material being discussed. Some of this, I’m sure is intentional - you’re supposed to be irritated by what characters say during some of these scenes. I still feel it results in a pretty bloated runtime. 

Still one of the better things I’ve watched this year, but maybe my least favourite Kaufman movie of all the ones I’ve seen.",imqf5b

The plot is really good , and the way he shows it on screen is amazing. Didn't go for too much narration and went the - Show , not tell ; rule of screenwriting. 

It was a slow burn even for a 2 hour 14 minutes long movie and I don't understand why he kept it that way. It could have been easily cut down to less than 2 hours and it would be a much better film in my opinion.

Except for the slow pacing , I really don't have anything against the movie.

All the actors , did a great job! The parents played by Toni Collete and David Thewlis were outstanding in my opinion. They really made the film good instead of just another slow film. The best part of the movie was when they were on screen.

After Tenet kept me guessing , another mind fucker of a movie this one turned out to be tbh. 

And that's good. It keeps you engaged , but yeah I didn't like the slow parts of the movie. 

The whispering in the ears part is the big clue here, and I don't wanna spoil it more.

To me the movie is about a lonely old janitor who is “thinking of ending things”(committing suicide). The whole movie is essentially one long delusion stuffed with real memories. It’s about regret that he didn’t become the things he wanted to be (a quantum physicist) or do the things he wanted to do (get a girlfriend, get married, etc).

I'm aware that this movie is a visual adaptation of a novel that I've never read, but I feel like this movie is nothing like the novel. It's too poetic, too focused on emotional responses in the moment (rather than causality) for it to be a film adaptation of a novel.

I kept waiting for the ""AHA!"" moment at the end but the credits rolled and I was left feeling pretty clueless about what the hell all of that was.

Either way, when I finished the book I told my wife the book was really good except for the over exposition of an ending but was excited because I knew Kaufman was going to take the premise and run with it.

g42fskh,"Absolutely the closest we have got to a companion piece for 'Synecdoche, New York', but whereas that focused on *not* experiencing life even as it is presented directly in front of you, this is more experiencing life *exactly* as it is presented to you as a form of emotional locked-in syndrome. Of course, that is as broad as a description for a Kaufman movie can be. It is almost impossible to analyse everything in this without writing a fucking thesis. Or sounding like Benoit Blanc during his doughnut speech. 

""A sponge in a sponge. But we must look a little closer. And when we do, we see that the sponge absorbs another sponge - it is not a sponge at all but a smaller sponge with its own absorption, and our sponge is not whole at all!""

So if 'S, NY' was absorbing nothing but your own self, this is about absorbing everything but yourself. Two sides of the same sponge, and like the entirety of Kaufman's career he is asking us once again why the fuck can't we just stop absorbing everything, anything at all.

The more knowledge we collect, the more questions we end up having. The great irony of life, huh? Just don't forget to step outside yourself and, you know, live.

As a footnote, this was the first time his directing matched his interior thought process and therefore, of his characters. Immediate cuts as blink to blink moments. Slow tracks as lost in thought bubbles. Camera wandering off out of focus before snapping back into the scene. All there, and perfectly in sync with the conversations. First 30 minutes are an editorial joy.

He would've loved nothing more than to be seen, to be recognized. That's what we all want, in some way or another. Also, the part where Jessie Buckley's in the basement, and she's having an inner monologue about how few people get to create, and most people just have other people's thoughts. How much of this man's little fantasy conversations are intertextual? How many conversations have we had about something someone else wrote? We're having one right now, after all.!<

People who dismiss the movie bc ""oh! [snaps fingers] i guessed the big twist within five minutes! i already found these twelve crazy things in the background! neat fuckin' trick chuck, can i go now?!"", they see not just movies but any story as an intellectual puzzle that the individual audience member has to put together, and the quicker they do that and the less cheating they use to finish, the greater the sense of accomplishment. What this is is vulgar positivism employed as a mechanism to avoid talking about how we connect to what is ultimately a story meant to bring emotions out of us, and on top of that it puts media consumption in a competitive framework, which is how we get Rick & Morty fans throwing shit at minimum-wage fast food service workers.",imqf5b

I’m a happy person and love life but after watching this movie I would rather die a slow death than watch it again. Literally anything is better. And I did 10yrs in prison and that was better. The fact ppl got paid for this makes me question reality as I know it !! If you think it’s a “smart” movie = get the Fawk over urself. If u think it’s artceee = u really suck.

g44gx6f,"It's a hard watch but a very rewarding one, especially you're a Kaufman fan. He brings in his surreal game but instead of hitting with it all, he does it gradually till the last minute of the movie. It's one of his bleakest films aided by unforgiving atmosphere and nihilistic talk. A bit meandering but never boring and that's one of the strongest takeaway that a talky, confusing film is still somehow engaging is the mark of a genus (you'd know if you see the film) filmmaker.

Jesse Plemons is perfectly cast (in fact all of them are). He is capable of being both wacky and humane and this character needed that. Jessie Buckley is wonderful too. I particularly loved her performance after they leave the house.

g5kkiae,"In recent years there has been a rather disturbing trend of movies going the allegorical route at the expense of making a good, congruent movie. It seems lazy to me, and I'm seeing it more and more recently: Lighthouse, Mother!, Midsommar, etc, and now this. You have the first half of a fantastic, tightly written and directed, character-driven story. Then the second half the director just says, ""You know what, screw all of this personal growth and subliminal conflict nonsense! Let's take this it to the absolute extreme. Horror, fantasy, throw it all in.. and, oh, the ending? Ehh, we'll figure something out when we get there."" 
    
This movie had the opportunity to tell a grounded story revolving around the extreme discomfort we have when meeting our S/O's family for the first time. The fear, the clashing of personalities, the revealing of the S/O's true self (which is what the basement should have been). An insight into who he will be and what he will look like years down the road. Not at all indifferent than Mother! (I don't know the man I married) or Midsummar (heartbreak and coming of age). Why pop a tab of acid halfway through...Why is this necessary? Suspension of disbelief can only go so far, IMO.

It’s a large investment of time and energy (to try an understand while you’re watching) ((more than one monologue is too much imo)) for almost zero payoff. 

Then going online and hearing there *is* some sort of objective narrative that was supposed to be communicated to me is just very upsetting. I’ve seen ambiguous movies that are up to interpretation and this came off as that but also isn’t that, and I think that’s why I would call it functionally a failure.

Seems like a bunch of self-indulgent bullshit tbh. Weirdness for the sake of weirdness.

Non linear subjects are really hard to depict as movies.  I think this movie needed a better editor.  The scenes in the car where he is just talking to his girlfriend were too long.  

The mental health aspects and the whole thing being the delusions of the Janitor who is Jake don't come up to the surface.  

I just felt the movie was too long.  In many places it was a chore to get through.  

I think the audience needs to be rewarded every now and then and there wasn't enough of a reward.

I have seen what some people have said about the young woman being Jake's imagination, but I have a different interpretation. It's kind of clear that they're the same person, but I think this could also be someone struggling with being transgender, or even just having a complicated personality that society obsessively genders every aspect of.

I noticed when the young woman shows the mother her art, it's the same art in the basement of Jake's house. His parents don't understand the expression as she explains it, yet it is still Jake's art- his name is on it. It could be a metaphor for not being able to explain his feelings about being transgender to his parents... I also recall the father using a word like ""sissy"" to describe feminine men. 

The janitor is who he becomes when he buries these feelings, which explains the hug in the hallway as him finally coming to terms with that part of himself.

I know not all of it fits, and there's a lot I'm leaving out, but there's so much. I really enjoyed it, multiple interpretations, complexity and all. I'm going to start reading the book soon to go through it more slowly.",imqf5b

I gotta say I thoroughly enjoyed the movie up until the school, it was very creepy, unsettling and sad leading up to it. The awkwardness between Jake and The Girlfriend was spot on in the car. Same with the tension between the family dinner or anytime they were together. 

You can see the small similarities between Jake and his characters esp the janitor, but beyond that ending I feel even knowing the story I was left way more confused than before. The weird long winded ballet scene just took away from the mystery and eeriness that lead up to it. 

Overall I just wasn't a fan of the end of the movie, everything else was great. If you're confused, I highly recommend reading the book or just looking up the last couple chapters to really round out the story.",imqf5b

g42r3h3,"The Goethe quote is the key to unlocking the film

&#x200B;

“Colors are the deeds/ and sufferings of light.”

&#x200B;

We are watching the film through the lens of a glass prism, and light (or people and situations) are being bent (or refracted) at different angles depending on the wavelength (mood coloring the scene/memory).

&#x200B;

I originally thought the 'young woman' was the 'old man' reflecting on his life - the film seems to signal as much from the outset when she appears to hear his thoughts before being picked up by Jake (and continues to be in contact with him via mobile phone).

&#x200B;

But it seems as if Jake's 'deeds' are been refracted and/or colored from the first moving image. The lonely  - and lowly - old man (aka Jake) appears to be taking a trip down memory lane prior to taking his life, and the film is asking us to make the painful journey with him.

&#x200B;

To now quote Memento

&#x200B;

“Memory can change the shape of a room; it can  change the color of a car. And memories can be distorted. They're just  an interpretation, they're not a record, and they're irrelevant if you have the facts. (Leonard Shelby,)”

g42yh38,"A few observations:

Jake avoids meeting his parents right away. Possibly it's too painful to remember them considering their ailments later on.

Small changes creep up during the scenes. The father's hair changes as soon he leaves the stairs. He has also a bandaid over his eye or not. 'Lucy's' outfit changes completly several times usually in color. Same goes for his parents between dinner and desert, to show the unreliable narrator right from the start.

Jake hands her his janitor glasses to look at her phone.

Jake does wear his dilligence pin during one of the scenes.

I think Janitor Jake meeting her in the school is basically the memory of her suddenly crossing his mind. That's why she is so bitter (and a lesbian) at first. But he softens on her which leads to the whole fantasy.

His fantasy plays in three locations he knows best from memory. That's why there aren't any inconsistencies there, unlike the clothing or hair.",imqf5b

We actually expected a horror film, but came away with a thought provoking film about time and all of the missed shots we don’t take. Brilliantly done.

She was a painter, a poet, or a physicist. He often forgot what name he gave her, or what name he thought about giving her. The house we see at the beginning of the film is basically the same as his. Weird wallpaper, a dog bone, same stairs. That’s just what he sees as normal for people. An “of course she likes dogs, everyone does” kind of deal. However, this bleeds in with his actual reality. She has similar mannerisms as him for example. From her telling him to look up something, to him telling her to look up something and that getting mixed together. He forgets her face at times when he sees another girl in a movie. It’s basically a movie where we are in his fantasy leading up to his death.

The first half is like “Get Out” from a woman’s POV, and has a lot of brilliant, horrifying insight. 

Then, it sort of becomes a horror movie from an introvert’s POV? And you’re kind of meant to sympathize with him, but then it confirms his fear that his fantasy woman wasn’t interested and thought he was a creep? So... what’s the takeaway there? The one character that’s real and we’re meant to sympathize with is also a creep? Coool.

If she’s essentially a projection of his mind, why would she have such a rich interior life and despise him so much? I don’t get it at all. 

And a lot of the surrealism felt too cute and self-satisfied by half.

Even Synechdoche NY had kind of a message of uplift. This and Anomalisa have so much to say, but end on such depressively bleak notes.

g4bgust,"If it were not for the Janitor and this whole thing being in his head, I think it would make for a great film on this woman and her feeling of being stuck in an unfulfilling life that becomes less ""her's"" the more she lives is. She's thinking of ending the relationship for the whole movie. She just keeps saying that this is the last time X or Y will ever happen, and yet we keep seeing more and more of her life with Jake as she stays with him while his parents pass away and he becomes a janitor at this school, and more and more of herself becoming Jake from the photo to her paintings. And she becomes more and more resentful of that day that she decided to take his number. He morphs from her boyfriend to this mosquito that she should have swatted. And her name keeps changing and her profession changes for him, and she keeps following him despite people saying she doesn't have to and laughing at him. 

And Jake isn't even really a bad guy. He's just not for her, but she doesn't know how to say ""no"" and break it off. So we see her stay and be unhappy, and she sees him grow old and become this Janitor at his old high school and she's just in the crowd as an old woman watching him die of loneliness even though she's there. Because the thing is that Jake isn't happy with her either. He's with her because she doesn't laugh at him. He doesn't even know her name or what she does. She's just someone to be with because he's scared he'll never find someone else. He wants someone to be there as his parents die. He wants someone to be there while he dies.

And the Janitor is a physical manifestation of this stagnation. 

I know that's not all there, but the elements of that hit harder for me than the message of an old, lonely man telling himself a story of a false relationship before he dies.",imqf5b

However, I liked very much the way that it describes a failed relationship. The way the people think, speak or express themselves. Everyone looks like lunatic.

When you see some people everyday in their jobs, and they become more and more depressed. It's like the life punches them in the face.",imqf5b

g4ibf7s,"Man I mean I like to think I’m the kind of moviegoer that’s doesn’t absolutely shit on a movie unless it’s truly warranted, but god damn was this bad. It’s a shame because the first half was really intriguing, even if I didn’t understand what was actually happening. The acting, the dialogue, the sharp shifts in tone and tension, it was all really interesting. 

Then it all went downhill very fast. Talk about ending up a dud. What the hell was Kaufman thinking?",imqf5b

g5cgg6s,"Couldn't resist watching this the second I saw the cast list. I was entirely uneducated about the book for what it's worth.  


Did not like this movie at all, even though I loved the acting and the weirdness. It feels like a bad attempt at David Lynch's style. The monologues (many of which are lifted wholesale from other media) are often jaw-clenchingly pretentious. The plot can be stated in a single sentence. There is no room for character growth due to the story being a string of fever dreams.  


The movie did make me uncomfortable though, and the opening scene in the car was building up so much mystery that I was really thinking my mind was going to be blown away by the end. But after the opening car ride I just felt like I had to throw up the entire movie (not in the fun horror movie kinda way) and I still can't entirely place my nausea - was it intended by the movie's design or was I uncomfortable because the movie just wasn't as good as it was pretending to be?",imqf5b
g44ewwz,"People on here will try to act smart and like this movie was a subtle masterpiece, but it flat out does not hold up. If the movie is just a fantasy of the janitor’s, why would he be fantasizing about the female character wondering around his house, lost, and stumbling upon all the books and art that he projected onto her? Why would he fantasize about her stumbling down into the basement and finding his work clothes? Masturbatory pseudo-intellectual hogshit",imqf5b
g4hoixc,"I HATED it. I wanted to watch a cool surreal movie, but it's so awkward and I increasingly hate Jake throughout the movie just to find out it's all about him. What a waste of my time. The girl that I was sympathizing for turned out to not even be an actual person. Reading some analyses here is sadly not softening the blow at all. The dude is pathetic, which is fine, but wasn't compelling to me at all. 

I liked the beginning at first, with the little ""glitches"" happening in the house. My dislike started when he started to break his promise. It reminds me of playing a video game called Braid. I know most people enjoy the ""amazing"" plot twist, but it rings a similar bell of being unpleasantly pathetic and I just really hated it.",imqf5b
g5y9y5s,"Two hours of my life wasted. What a pretentious film. Trailer made it out to be some thriller and it was not at all and I felt robbed. A wank of a film centred around completely obscure conversations.

If I knew it was going to be a ""you have to look at the deeper meaning to get this"" type film I would have stayed away. Any movie that requires an essay to understand is not a good movie.

It was long, boring and doesn't live up to any of the ""hype"". I sincerely hope anybody reading this comment who isn't in to abstract/surreal films to stay away and watch some guy play bongo drums for 2 hours instead. You would be more entertained.",imqf5b

g5443cq,"Everything made sense to me going through the movie, and I really loved it. The only part that wasn’t clear was the girl at the ice cream shop. The arm and reference to smelling varnish was apparently more of a book thing and was fuzzy in the movie.

But yeah, everything else clicked in a sad sort of way; it’s a love letter to suicidal thoughts. I can see who here also has more introverted awareness than others, given the divisive comments.",imqf5b
g57q48f,"The movie was definitely very thought-out, with Kaufman going very deep into his ideas and incorporating it into the film. However, I found the movie to be extremely unapproachable and that's saying something as a person who enjoys ""critic-movies"" or those that are usually branded as boring.  


For me, the movie was not just boring, it was too unapproachable as a viewer. I felt like it works better as a concept but its incorporation into a film is too constricting to Kaufman's psyche and it doesn't feel like he lets his audience in it. For me, movies can **definitely** be very abstract and in the best way, this can lead to multiple interpretations about it.  


In this movie's case, almost all the symbolism lead to a certain point of view which Kaufman already made without leaving much room for additional interpretations.   


To fix this, I think there should be another cut of the movie which can showcase its symbolism better as the acting, the cinematography, production, etc, was absolutely stunning (special shoutout to Buckley's amazing acting). The script, though, especially for the car scenes could use some toning down.",imqf5b

g45mm9x,"I'm going to get wrecked in this thread for this and after some Googling, I realize I'm in the minority, but I thought this movie was an awful adaptation of the novella. I feel like this movie is a classic case of a skilled, artistic person having too much freedom in doing what he wants and needing to be reined in.

Half (more?) of this (long!) movie was extremely visually boring to watch, spent in that car with just two people reciting poetry and arguing, but it didn't do anything to drive up the tension or claustrophobia that the 4:3 aspect ratio also was trying (and failed) to induce. The aspect ratio was just pointless. There's no real way to tell >!it's all in his head!< without having read a summary or the actual novella. Random cartoons and 20 minutes of interpretive dance were unnecessary fartsy stuff. So much of the movie had little details that didn't lead anywhere and were basically for reasons only in Kaufman's head: the million ice cream cups in the garbage, the rash, the varnish smell (*maybe* >!he's varnishing the floors as he's fantasizing!<?), etc.

I like some of Kaufman's earlier stuff, but this one was just so far up its own ass and didn't even try to be coherent. Even Lynch interrogating a monkey is more coherent.",imqf5b

I've watched this and Synecdoche and while I think they're very well made films, there's just something that doesn't click for me. Its not that I find these weird and cerebral films unattractive... Just something with Kaufman that I find frustrating.

Can't love em all I guess.",imqf5b
g4g6vc7,Idk if anyone else noticed or if it’s just me but that speech at the end that he gave before he sang reminded me a lot of Russel Crowe’s acceptance speech in A Beautiful Mind.

g4hzhut,"I honestly would have liked this movie more if it ended with the girl walking away from the janitor. That to me felt like the purpose of the film - Jake being able to let go of this fantasy girl he created, learning that people aren’t just there to be his wish-fulfillment, and from the girl’s perspective that it is okay to leave people even if they aren’t mentally okay because it isn’t fair to you. I felt everything after that point was just too depressing for no reason and didn’t have anything else to say.",imqf5b
g429pad,"Probably Kaufman's coldest film and my least favourite film of his since Modern Nature. Still, one of the best films of the year and a great continuation of themes I feel like Kaufman has tried exploring his whole career (specifically longing for human connection). It's certainly a lot closer to Synecdoche NY (my 2nd favourite film of all time) than I expected but not as ambitious, heartbreaking, or self-reflexive. I also did find some of the movie references in here quite hilarious too. And holy shit, Jessie Buckley's Pauline Kael impression was on point. 8/10 or 9/10 (can't decide until a rewatch I think)",imqf5b

The ending wasn’t even worth it, wouldn’t recommend to anyone and I don’t understand why everyone is raving about this.

g44vti7,"I read the book a few years ago and felt like it was well written and had loads of atmosphere but ultimately wasted some interesting characters on a third act “twist” that’s been overdone to death and negated everything is enjoyed about the story to that point.

I felt the same way about the movie but even moreso. Kaufman ratcheted up the weirdness to such a degree that it was obvious none of what we were seeing was really happening and it devolved into camp. Also, you can load your movie with references to Cassavetes etc. all you want but “time washes over you” is an idea I’ve seen before and it wasn’t all that deep the first time. Even worse, the movie took almost as much time as reading the book.

I like movies that are dreamlike and surreal. I’ve had it with movies about characters that aren’t really characters doing things that have no consequence because the events are only happening in someone’s mind. Especially when the movie is pretentious and overlong by a country mile.",imqf5b

g4552ut,"Having watched Synecdoche, New York, Anomalisa, and now this over the past three days, I find that Kaufman’s films which he wrote and directed seem to delve into the same substance just contrasted with different characters to question the protagonist along his journey.

Having only just seen his films recently and not knowing his place in the film world entirely, is this something that other have caught onto as a flaw and something that seems to be Kaufman just treading in similar waters?

His films are all interesting, despite needing to be heavily researched afterwards to fully understand the deeper meaning, but I’m surprised he hasn’t tackled similar themes hidden beneath something entirely different.",imqf5b

I'll probably watch it tonight just to see, but what the heck. They really seem to have abandoned the atmosphere the book laid out. Either that or the trailer is incredibly misleading. The quirky music makes me think its the former.

g493c1j,"I didn't put it together until it pretty much laid it out for me in the end. At first I thought it was some time travel thing because they mention she's a physicist but I think that was an intentional red herring. Then I interpreted it was a metaphor for abuse. The way he was dominating and manipulating her thoughts, making her dependent on him in a dangerous situation, gas-lighting her so she wouldn't believe her own memories, his seemingly calm demeanor that erupts in anger at times, etc. Every time she got close to thinking about leaving he would interrupt the thought process and redirect.

It also the first Charlie Kaufman work I seen too (writing or directing) and I really like it 

one of my favourite scene is the dinner scene, it remind me of Yorgos Lanthimos movie awkwardness but the character acting it everything around them in instead it's different kind of disturbing

and I was surprise that i able to understand quite lot of it, watching video on Everywhere At The End Of Time help me get it quite quick when they mention dementia, same with the dialogue while i didn't understand everything or the reference it's quite mesmerizing, I mean the character, the story and the commentary is just in all of the dialogue it's amazing and if i'm actually fully understand what they saying I probably enjoy it even more",imqf5b

I also think this film wants you to find out what it’s trying to say or at least find your own interpretation all along early on. I believe when The Janitor is staring out his window at the beginning, one shot looks like Plemons is the one looking out the window. I also adored the final dance number - an interpretive dance showing Jake as the hero as he defends The Young Woman from the creepy Janitor that the students mock.",imqf5b
g4a6v6c,"I love this claustrophobic Lynchian nightmare of a film.  Both Jesse's were fantastic especially Buckely. She was amazing in Beast and Chernobyl (let's forget Doolittle shall we?), but she blows those out of the water. The shifting accent for Young Woman was a particularly great touch; in other movies I might have been taken out, but it added to the early mystery. The whole was wonderfully creepy and offputting. I mention Lynchian as it feels horror in the same way many of his works do (or just some scenes like Wild at Heart).   


While anyone reading this knows what is ultimately about, I spent most of it thinking a different path, along with trying to figure exactly how. Even down that alternate path, what I thought I was experiencing, I believe, is just as valid and meaningful.    
I thought for most of the film, she was an amalgamation of disastrous first-meetings with the parents. I thought that was the explanation of the shifting names, backstories, jobs, and parental changes. I figured early he was the Janitor, sliding into his memories. Or she was one person, but his memories are so fuzzy (for some reason I was very moved when old Janitor runs into Young Woman and they tear up). 

Hell for a moment, I thought it was a time loop with endless variations of the same nightmare scenario. 

Either way, the film speaks to emotional inertia, the sickness of memory, the sheer uncomfortably of meeting parents or other figures the person you came with has a long history with. I always feel like a outsider and very uncomfortable in this things, especially when essentially trapped. But we've all been in Jake's position too.",imqf5b

And now watching like 10 videos explaining it.
Amazing.
So many different interpretations.

It was basically the janitors fragmented memories of his ideal relationship that did or didn’t happen.
Specifically when he went to his house bc his mother was sick & dying.

The girl is real or isn’t.

But he goes to visit his daughter(s?) at the ice cream shop before he kills himself at the end.
So he did have a relationship?

Or was that his dream too?

Or were the phone calls from his real wife?
Trying to stop him from committing suicide?

At the beginning we see the old guy looking outside at the swingset.
Then when hes driving to his parents, the house is demolished.
So why do we see him in present old age day in that house getting ready for work?

Ugh fuck so many questions lol

Such an incredible movie

Edit :

Oh shit so just realized him getting ready in the house with the swing was a memory.

He then moves in to the parents house?

And when hes in the parents house, he relives all those memories/fantasys.

His mother dying.
Him bringing a girl to meet his parents.

His parents are dead by the end, and hes in the farm house.


So who was the girl at the ice cream shop?

Why did she have scarring?
His hand had scarring to right?

g4bdzpt,"So many threads in this film have been previously explored by Kaufman.  It's interesting how he was able to use the novel to express his own ideas.

Anomalisa - blurry conceptions of external people that aren't differentiated in the male protagonist's mind, and a chance encounter with an idealized woman.

Being John Malkovich - transference into the perspective of another person, without understanding the true nature of their character.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind - unstructured memories surfacing like fragments and jumps in time.

Adaptation - there is a sequence shoehorned in there where a man fantasizes quite intensely about a random waitress.  Kind of a male trope, but very much in keeping with the ideas expressed in this film.",imqf5b

I wouldn’t worry about it though, I don’t think a director’s goal is for a viewer to be able to critically analyse and breakdown their film, like solving a puzzle. As long as there’s an emotional reaction I think that’s the main thing.

Honestly, maybe I just didnt know what I was getting myself into but when a movie is trending on Netfliz you assume it has to have at least SOME kind of broad appeal, right?

Wrong. Not being hyperbolic: personally it was the worst movie I've ever seen, without contest.

EDIT: no disrespect to those that enjoyed it.

g425jnc,Immediately ordered the book after it ended. How does it compare?,imqf5b
g42ufjz,"I absolutely loved this movie but damn it needed maybe one more scene of resolution. 

As someone who read the book: Kaufman absolutely nailed the tone. The uneasiness and the uncertainty of who these characters were and why they are how they are. 

As someone who knew what was going on I loved it. I loved knowing that I’m watching someone’s perception of everyone in their life; whether those people are close family or complete strangers. 

My wife had no context and honestly didn’t really get it until I explained it to her. At that point she totally understood what was going on and liked it that much better but without a more definitive resolution I don’t know it had as powerful of an impact. 

Overall I just think it needed one extra scene to really become an all time great.",imqf5b
g4262q2,"So I read the book and watched the movie. While the Book was interesting and gripping throughout, the ending is we've seen before in movies like Fight Club and Sixth Sense etc. I think Kaufman's vision is something much more than the mental illness from the Book, while the Book becomes like a thrilling ""chase"" in the last 20%. But the Kaufman took that concept , twisted it and turned it into a fever dream. 

While I still need to rewatch it few times but on one watch I think Charlie represented the human psyche and constant mental battles better than the Book which was very hard to top. 

Book - 4/5
Movie- 4.5/5",imqf5b
g42frsk,"Having read the book kind of spoils it. Though I think it’s necessary to know from the get-go that >!everything’s happening in the janitor’s mind!< (or at least that’s my interpretation)

I could talk days about the performances, the eerie-ness of the dinner scene, the sounds that keep going after the scene ends, the main character’s >!multiple names!<, the dialogue overlapping, sound mixing, etc

On the third act I think >! that the dances signify the romance the janitor once had with this young lady (who is very similar to the main character) and basically, in my opinion, this whole movie is the janitor remembering past experiences before death (Suicide? Hypothermia?)

I still have some unanswered questions though, like >! the Robert Zemeckis movie, the final “act” with Anomalisa- like people or the paintings in the parents’s house, which is something I didn’t get in the book either. Maybe they were drawings the janitor once painted??? Idk!<
Honestly I think this is a pretty masterfully made movie in every sense. So glad Netflix picked it up",imqf5b
g42w0ad,"I watched this with my mother, and she was convinced that the janitor had at some point abducted and probably murdered the young woman; I didn't think so until the interpretive dance scene where he grabbed her aggressively. We figured she was dead and this was an abstract retelling of her abduction and murder because of things like Jake ignoring her pleas to go home, the janitor watching the play and focusing on the lead actress/using a peephole, the young woman complaining about how men won't leave women alone unless they say they're taken/complaining about ""Baby It's Cold Outside"" being rapey... Now that I've read more discussion on it and understand what was happening, I'm relieved (!) to find out that the actual intent was just depressing and not creepy, hah.

During their drive ""home,"" I thought the young woman was being played by a different actress in one shot and figured I was just imagining it but, nope, she was [briefly played by the actress in the fake Zemeckis movie!](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/09/im-thinking-of-ending-things-ending-explained-book-oklahoma) That was cool. 

I have watched some stuck-in-a-time-loop movies recently, so the dumpster full of identically discarded not-Blizzards and the ballet actors appearing behind the characters made me think it was going to turn into that for a moment until I saw the Jake dancer didn't look like him outside of the clothes.

Overall, I liked it! I was expecting more straight-up horror, but I liked the quiet uneasiness a lot. It felt more than a little long, but I imagine on rewatch, knowing what I do now, it'd feel less bloated when you know what purposes everything serves. This was my first Charlie Kaufman movie, but now I'm going to track down more of his stuff.

My sister has been telling me to listen to the *Oklahoma!* revival for the past couple of days, and I'm kicking myself for not doing that before watching this so I could be like ""hey, I know that song!!""",imqf5b

g47o0vq,"*Eminently* tedious. Excessively repetitious.

The characters and characterization are nonexistent, partially on purpose and partially not. The ""two"" main ""characters"", who serve to pseudophilosophically converse for the majority of two hours, go by the names of Charlie and Kaufman, and never stop loquaciously bickering until the last act (which was extraordinarily predictable).

From the first fifteen minutes, you have an expansive understanding of what the film has to offer and where it will end. Unfortunately, the film continues though for another two hours, beating you over the head with the meaninglessness of the main character's name, or their intertwined identity with Jake, or the apparent misogyny that perpetuates in society. It's as though the film is screaming at you, ""**EXISTENTIALISM**"". Rather than allowing any themes to naturally boil to the top, the themes consume the entire pot's contents from top to bottom.

Nothing about the film stands out except for how boring it is. It's another derivative, stagnantly directed, surrealist ""horror"" film in the vein of *The Shining*. However, it lacks all of the character, performances, and identity that earn *The Shining* its acclaim.",imqf5b

g42nnd3,"My first Kaufman film, never felt more thrown in the deep end lol. Enjoyed it overall, still trying to wrap some threads together. My understanding is that the Young Woman is a construct of Jake's mind (her backstory keeps changing, her original poem is something Jake read earlier, Jake can seemingly hear her thoughts), and the movie is either:

1. Jake as the janitor plunging himself into a fantasy of what his life has been, fuelled by the romance of musicals and fiction (the rom-com), or...
2. Jake in his late-20s (or however old he is for most of the film) grappling with ageing and recognising that his best days are already behind him, and creating the Young Woman as a coping mechanism (the bit where he talks about how old people are just tossed on the ash heap of life etc.)

Ultimately I have no idea. Great cinematography and score, and excellent performances. Jesse Plemons is much more likeable when he isn't murdering kids and fucking up Aaron Paul. Wished there was more Toni Collette, but I get why the film moved along as it did.

8/10 overall. I feel like I should rewatch it but honestly I'd rather watch Eternal Sunshine or Synecdoche, New York and get a better understanding of Kaufman before I do.",imqf5b

g431nyq,"This was my first Kaufman film so I went in completely blind. I thought the movie was interesting. What I gathered from it was that Lucy starts to lose elements of herself at that dinner with Jake’s family and questions her want to end the relationship, but her seeing his family transition between old and young conveys her perception of what the future would be like for them. I think when things went wrong like the dog glitching and the mother prodding her to go into the basement to live dangerously where she found the janitor’s clothes, it was her misremembering details of that night when looking back. She started the movie confident in her thoughts but as she let Jake get in her head, she began to forget and just take his word for how the night was going. I got mostly everything up until she and Jake reunite in the school and two other versions come out and begin dancing. Everything after that was strange because it shifted the focus to Jake (and the janitor which I assumed was older Jake). Lucy who seemed to lose her identity throughout  becoming Lucia, then Louisa, then Ames, seemed to be completely discarded, which we then see when Jake accepts the award at the end for his work in physics even though Lucy was always said to be the one good at physics working on that geriatric research. The mother said Jake would work hard, but was never talented or bright, which Lucy was. Jake griped about receiving the discipline pin and nothing more so for him to get that prestigious award at the end makes me think he assumed her identity somehow:

- he seemed to be able to read all Lucy’s thoughts

- Lucy asks who that kid in the picture was and Jake says it was him, while Lucy claims it was her

- the girl at the ice cream place said she worried about Lucy if she kept going on the road with Jake

- any time Lucy got close to figuring out that something was wrong with Jake or that he was reading her mind he would snap her out of it and she would become slightly forgetful

- She asks to go home and he says her home is the farm. She also mentions later that she knows farm life is tough because she grew up on one making me think that Jake’s parents may be Lucy’s, which is why they don’t seem to remember anything about him without his prompts

A few things I don’t get that if anyone wants to explain to me are:

- Why is there baby food on the cloth that she puts in the washer in the basement? We never see them get any younger 

- Who was Yvonne the second person to call Lucy (while she was at the farm)? Was that the girl from the ice cream shop with the arm rash? 

- Why does the janitor not look like old Jake if they’re the same person? Is the janitor someone else? Lucy’s relative? Is that why she feels safe when hugging him even though Jake claimed he was a pervert? If they’re the same why do they exist in the same timeline? I get we don’t see the old janitor and jake at the same time but that just feels off.

- what is the significance of the mom’s ear ringing?

- Kaufman seemed to love using doors in this film to represent time. Did the janitor die by freezing to death and then walking into the light at the school with the pig?

- what does the jake that died in the dance signify? Why was the other janitor battling that jake?

- the rash girl from the ice cream place said it wasn’t actually varnish in the back. Was she referring to the school being cleaned? What was that supposed to mean?

- When Lucy answers the phone from herself the third time her phone rings what does that message mean? That message was also given when Yvonne called. 


I feel like I watched two entirely different movies and I’m trying to connect the two together. I understand that Jake made it all up. I’m just trying to justify motifs and themes because at the interpretive dance part everything that was built just seemed to be thrown out. Maybe that’s the intention.",imqf5b

g445ycb,"This lady's voice is so soothing, I'm not usually susceptible to ASMR but it really calms me when she talks. Perfect voice over voice. Also I love this type of movie that just focuses on the writing and the characters interacting as action in the story, it's like a visual poem or a play. Any more like this, besides Kaufman's other stuff? I can only think of Glen Glengarry Ross, or The Man From Earth, maybe Linklater's stuff.",imqf5b
g44amkd,"I found it unbelievably unsettling. There are so many cuts and shot compositions that play against what you'd expect, and the effect is as close to a nightmare as I can remember a film feeling in a long time. Maybe *Mulholland Drive*. The framing of conversations, which sometimes leaves characters alone staring off-camera but often puts characters uncomfortably close to each other, was effective. So were the occasional breaks in the fourth wall or complete ruptures in what we were seeing (like the Young Woman turning into the movie character for a brief moment).

Like, there's a cut to David Thewlis as an old man which shouldn't be terrifying, and yet because the film keeps changing and warping in front of us, it made me feel really uncomfortable. Similarly, the scene where the Young Woman is hiding from the Janitor shouldn't be frightening, given it's just an old man mopping, and yet I had so little idea what was about to happen, I was incredibly anxious.

I don't think it's perfect - the finale with the musical number may have pushed things so far into bizarre territory that I got a little less invested, and I wonder if there are some things that are lost in translation from the source novel. Still, I'm always looking for films that feel different, something I have never seen before. This film is unique. It might also be the weirdest film I have ever seen.",imqf5b
g4751f2,"Wow I had no idea what the book was about or what the writer’s intention for this movie was before I watched. 

I pretty much thought it was all about the little horrors of dating from a (straight) woman’s POV - the extreme dread when you question whether you should end it when you no longer want to be in the relationship but it’s not that terrible (“he doesn’t beat me”), feeling like you are just a prop to make a man feel better, being stuck in awkward situations with weird family members, being a slave to the whims of a man who has you captive (in this situation at least  she relies on him to get home and I felt dread the whole movie thinking something would go poorly and she’d end up dead or something), slowly realizing the guy you’re dating may be kind of crazy (as told by his temper tantrums). I was able to rationalize some of the absurdism through this interpretation (not all of it of course because when do absurd movies like this ever make 100% complete sense). Like all those Oreo brrs in the dumpster were the “red flags” or thoughts about ending things that she ignored; all of the phone calls from herself were her trying to get through to herself what she actually feels about the situation; the parents jumping around in age were her realizing all of the things she would have to put up with by staying with this man and his rapidly aging parents; the mom’s monologue about the Jake’s personality was her realizing what was wrong with her boyfriend (and often other entitled men as well).

g4gd3wk,"Bit of a mess of a film innit? 

I think there's a lot to unpack, it's obviously not a traditional narrative. You've got to really focus to understand what's going on and I'm sure reading the book would help and having a good grasp on the musical Oklahoma. Two fairly obscure things that bring up a barrier to actually enjoying the film - never a good start. 

It has lot of cool philosophical points. Kaufman as always brings up a lot of insightful remarks about the human condition - our lives, what our insecurities are. More times than one someone would say something and I'd think ""fuck I felt that"". I also like its dream like aesthetic, feel like he's channeling Lynch a lot in this movie. Very Inland empire, just with a bigger budget. It's like a freaky child's picture book at times. The fucked up dreams of a dementia patient. It's also genuinely off putting, uncomfortable, and scary in moments. I actually wish it pushed it even further and gave me a fucked up jump scare or something. 

I did like the acting. First time seeing or noticing Jessie Buckley and I think she's really talented. Toni Collette I think was under utilized but did her part well. 

I just think overall though it's bloated, nonsensical, too many ideas at once, and doesn't have a good enough narrative that's worth putting in the time too. I miss the Kaufman of old, where he had the interesting stories and narratives that had a clear beginning and end. They were dark, but there was something refreshing about them and original. I really think he does better as a writer than a director. Working with a director that'll push back on some of his ideas. I'd love if him and Jonze or even Gondry teamed up for another film. The shit he's making now feels like stuff he'd be better off unloading in his next therapy session. I'm genuinely concerned for his mental health. 

I think i'd get more out of repeat viewings, I just don't think I can bring myself to watch this again. Cool dance scene though.

g43qeb5,"I’m wondering if Jake might have been gay and part of the tragedy of his story was a life of repression. 

First, he seems to take offense when the girlfriend says “sissies” in her line about getting old. Then later he is a bit defensive when she ropes homosexuality in with personality disorders. He goes on to talk about how coddling mothers were once perceived to be the cause of homosexuality, which seems to correlate with Toni Collette’s character picking up toys as a young housewife and telling the girlfriend how she coddled Jake as a boy and possibly enabled some of his neurosis . Then I suppose, if we’re reading into stereotypes, you could see his love of musical theatre as a possible indicator. I don’t know, what do you think?

I found it interesting that “Jake” seemed to be more eloquent and lucid at dinner with his parents while “Lucy” was stuttering and forgetting words. But in the car both times she was the more intelligent, expressive person and Jake seemed out of his element. Not sure what that means.

\- The spit on the corner of Jake's mouth. I know they were talking about rabies right before this happens.

\- The young woman staring at the camera as she recited the poem. She stares at the camera for like 30 seconds.

\- A barn door randomly opening in the background as they walk into the barn.

\- The dead lambs. I feel like it might have something to do with how Jake fantasizes about his younger self in these fantasies & how it leads to his demise.

\- maggot infested pig(s).

\- Some reflection of something in the car window as the young woman takes the last drag of her cigarette. The camera focuses on the cigarette and moves to the right a bit, then it looks like there's some silhouette being shown. Looks kinda like someone standing on a big rock. Reminds me of the painting, [Wanderer above the Sea of Fog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanderer_above_the_Sea_of_Fog), that is shown in the beginning of the movie.

\- Why did Jake get so upset about the ""Brrs"" in the car? and why didn't he throw them away in the trash can by the car?

Based on the title, I was expecting a depressing drama about suicide, but was pleasantly surprised to find a psychological horror. Then, I researched even further to find out it's technically both.

My two favorite genres, horror and drama, were intertwined beautifully in this movie. Horror upon my viewing and drama upon revisiting it in my head.

I found the interpretive dance scene of the big reveal in the book to be a bit of cheeky criticism of how it could have been handled by a different writer but amplified to an extreme degree. I burst out of laughing when he threw the little rags of blood. 

I think it takes a very horror themed book and makes it about pondering our own lives and how they could have turned out if we were a little less brave. I can see how it's infuriating to some people who read the book though. I wouldn't want Kaufman to adapt any book I genuinely like as is. 

I like how so many parts of her personality were derived from his own interests. It reminded me of something I read once about the strangers in our dreams being people we have seen in real life.

The movie feel apart for me at the end. I guess Kaufman was just too cool to do a clear ending like in the book? Or he felt he had done such a good job with the girlfriend character, that he decided he didn't want her to just be a figment of Jake's imagination, and was willing to throw away the entire plot of the movie and just make it ""a bunch of weird stuff that happened"" instead?

This is one of the few times I'd say, read the book BEFORE you see the film. If you identify with mental illness, suicide, and psychology, then the film will certain connect with you, but you'll definitely have a lot of questions. 

But this is a masterpiece. I wouldn't mind if Kaufman adapted every novel, because what he adds to this both respects the spirit of the novel without distorting the message, his additions actually enrich the experience and central meaning. 

This is an all-consuming experience, psychologically and emotionally. 

You're appreciation of the film will vary depending on what kind of person you are, and everyone will have multiple interpretations, which is why reading the novel is imperative to truly understand it. 

It's been both interesting and frustrating watching youtube critics give analysis' on the film (Grace Randolph, for instance, completely missed the point entirely, and interepreted entirely wrongly interpreted nearly all of it), but if you are a Kaufman fan you will adore this, if you loved the book, it's a respectable and satisfying adaptation. It stays true to the source material while translating it to cinema as only Kaufman can. 

It's not a horror film, but it's psychologically distressing. Especially if you've dealt with suicidal tendencies or have been unable to connect with the world and people around you. 

Of course, the performances are uniformly excellent. Buckley continues to prove what a great actress she is, Plemons continues to seemingly channel Philip Seymour Hoffman, Thewlis is all-consuming in a brief part, while Toni Collette continues to be one of the greatest actresses of her generation. But the great thing is no actor 'steals' the film, they are all great and add to the rich tapestry. 

Many will hate this. But if you're willing to open your mind and your empathy, it will knock you flat once you piece it all together. 

It's akin to Mulholland Drive, and Kaufman's own Synecdoche, NY. It may be one of his best films as a director. 

I'm absolutely consumed by this story and film and novel, it speaks to me, and I relate to it on a spiritual level. Just amazing. 

If you need any answers on specifics, just hit me up. It's really not that hard to understand once you realize what it's truly representing. Just amazing.

1) Didn't the dance sequence give rape vibes? This other man was trying to kiss the girl and remove her shirt. There is also a discussion about a rapey song just before that, Baby it's cold outside. So is there any background related to that? Who are the three people in the dance sequence? All Jake? I read in the comments how the father looked weird with the girl, can it be that? Or is the basement freakout and the scratches on the door? 
2) What was the old person going on about one question one answer?

g42v0f7,"Watched it last night, undoubtedly one of the best films I've watched this year. It was both heartbreaking and beautiful.

Here's my interpretation of the film, with a lot of spoilers:

The film is entirely from the Janitor's perspective, whoever he is. With a fair share of trauma in the past, introspection in his life (the most prominent symbol of these is the maggot-infested pig), and a very imaginative mind, he sees people beyond their current present point in time. This is also an introspection shared by the unnamed Jessie Buckley's character (whom I will refer as the ""Female Protagonist""), after the meeting with Jake's parents:

> People like to think themselves as points moving through time. But I think it's probably the opposite. We're stationary, and time passes through us, blowing like cold wind, stealing our heat, leaving us chapped and frozen. [...] I feel like I was that wind tonight. Blowing through Jake's parents. Seeing them as they were, seeing them as they will be. Seeing them after they're gone. When only I'm left. Only the wind.

The entire plotline of Jake and FP is definitely unreal, and just a figment of the Janitor's imagination. A possible future of them, many possible variants of FP, and many possible futures of Jake's parents.

My remaining questions:

* **Where does the Janitor meet Jake or FP to have this story**? It's possible that Janitor, is simply, well, a janitor at the high school Jake, at some point of time, attends, and the Janitor foresees his possible rocky and near-marriage relationship with FP (which is somehow interfered and never becoming, as shown in the dance scene). The other obvious answer is from him meeting FP upon entering the school while looking for Jake. Or even better yet, answered by my next question.

* **Who is the Janitor**? I was mostly interpreting the Janitor as a third party random bystander, until I realised that Jake and the Janitor were never in the same scene. It's highly probable that Jake is the Janitor himself, seeing going through his memory with someone whom he did not know very well, hence the extremely shaky and inconsistent information about FP. I have seen theories proposing that Jake never asked for her number, and hence ""murdered"" the happily-married Jake as the Janitor, as shown in the dancing sequence. It makes quite a lot of sense.

* **What are the phone calls**? My analysis is, these are the remaining part of herself, trying to get information to her and compelling her to do something. This is why their names are similar in someway, such a Lucy and Louisa, and her real name most likely starts with L and is somewhere in between. I have no idea what the callers were trying to do, though.

* **What does the basement represent**? I have no idea.

* **What is the final scene**? I did not expect this scene at all, thinking the film was ending. My guess is, the final scene represents Jake's ultimate fantasy, if they marry, in which Jake has a ambiguously successful career, something between physics and musical acting (both of which Jake has expressed passions about in the film), accepts a prestigious award and dedicates it to an elderly FP.

* **What the heck is Robert Zemeckis doing here?** I can imagine this movie-within-a-movie contributed to this film in some thematical way (a man, out of love, causing the woman he loved to lose her job, like how Jake is taking FP back to the city late), but other than that, it was a bizarre moment. I'd just take it as a free advertising moment for Rober Zemeckis, whom I actually want to see returning to filmmaking.

I think I do have an idea of what is going on and the thematic elements in it, but of course, there are a lot of shaky details that I cannot fully flesh out, which, having been a David Lynch enthusiast at some point of time, I fully understand that they are not always meant to be fleshed out.

On a side note, this film has a lot of common themes with Jaco Van Dormael's **Mr. Nobody** (another film I dearly love), in case someone enjoys this and would like to find something similar.",imqf5b
g42wf8h,"I watched this film completely sober but the film made me feel as though I was very very high, misperceiving reality, doubting my own senses, second guessing myself, type of high.",imqf5b
g42avp6,This movie is amazing when you are high,imqf5b
g4323ri,"Copying my other comment here:

> There is no figuring it out. I legitimately think that was part of Kaufman’s point. We enter into movies/stories with a certain expectation of cohesiveness, linearness, and orientation; this movie violated that expectation. It was a surrealist painting come to life. To try to “get it” isn’t getting it.",imqf5b
g436vrn,"I quite liked it. Probably could have cut down the runtime(and kept my gfs attention) if they had trimmed some of those car conversations down a bit, but that's my only gripe.

How the film actually turned out was great too, although more abstract storytelling techniques like interpretive dance and musical numbers from musicals that I don’t know lost me a bit at the end. I would’ve prefer they wrapped it up purely with acting, but that’s my personal preference I guess. The performances were amazing all round and those god damned too-long pauses Toni Collette and David Thewlis take when speaking make my skin crawl.",imqf5b
g43zgkt,This film gave me a major Mulholland drive vibe. Anyone else?,imqf5b
g449cqu,"Just finished it last night. Needed to collect my thoughts. 

Holy hell. The script. The editing. The performances. It’s so meticulously crafted. There are so many layers to peel back. Perhaps it’s right to say this may be one of Kaufman’s more inaccessible pieces, especially if you haven’t read the book, but I’d argue it’s also his most daring and satisfying. As a filmmaker, the man’s craft is unclassifiable. 

I’m confident that—while yes, there admittedly have not been many new releases this year—*I’m Thinking of Ending Things* is a contender for one of 2020’s best.

I haven't seen Jessie Buckley in anything before (from what I can recall) and she was *so* good.",imqf5b
g45oe0q,"Well.. My interpretation of the ending was that he was actually a rapist murderer that took his own life.  
But seemingly that's false.  
So I guess I completely missed the point of this one.  
  
But I mean.. There were so many signs.  
Like, being made fun of girls, developing resentment towards them, the young woman just describing him as a creep that stared, discussing the rapey song, the dance where the janitor murders her boyfriend (even though it was obviously himself, but.. It was just confusing), singing about wanting to stop dreaming and going to take a woman for himself.",imqf5b

g48fuof,"I interpreted it actually differently than most people seem to be doing so, probably not as intended. I thought it was all told from the girls perspective as she is struggling with dementia and alzheimers. She constantly thinks she is still on that first trip that they took together when she was still weary of their relationship. This could explain why the scenes are so fragmented and confusing, it would explain why the guy keeps getting annoyed when she keeps wanting to go home. Sometimes he plays along with her stories about her being a poet a physicist a painter or whatever. Also it gives a different meaning to the scene where she confronts the janitor in the school. It is actually the moment where she stops recognizing jake as her husband and he has to just accept it that they are now forever strangers.... Would like to hear what you guys think of this?",imqf5b

g4391oa,"great movie, as the credits rolled i knew i liked it but also had no idea what the fuck i just watched so immediately googled the ending of the movie to have it explained. so looking back, a lot of it makes sense knowing it was all a fantasy of the janitor’s. but there are still some things i’m confused about:

1. if the girl was a fantasy of the janitor’s, then why did he make her so intent on leaving? if it was me and i had made up this whole backstory for some random girl i met in passing, and i was fantasizing about her coming to visit my parents and spend time with me, i would make her be like “noo i never want to leave i wanna stay here forever with you xoxoxoxoxoxooxoxox...” so why, in the fantasy, was she so intent on leaving?

2. what was with the girl at the ice cream shop warning the girlfriend about moving forward? what was the varnish smell she apologized for, then later admitted wasn’t varnish after all, and what was the smell anyway? (btw, noticed a connection between this girl apologizing for a smell and Jake apologizing for the smell of his dog earlier, wonder if that’s significant...)

3. what was with the swingset the girlfriend commented on earlier on in the movie? Jake seemed kind of perturbed that she brought it up. 

overall great movie, worthy of a rewatch to parse out all the details.",imqf5b
g43aegm,"So zany and so different. Only Kaufman could make something like this. I felt like this was his take on a horror about aging, memory and aging. To even begin to grasp what he was going for you’ll have to watch it at least three times. Yikes. Tulsey Town was a perfect creepy mix of McDonalds, Burger King, Wendy’s and Dairy Queen.",imqf5b
g43gk3l,"Wow. That was quite a film. And I realize that ""wow"" is an all purpose reaction.  


I honestly don't know how to feel. There were so many great parts of this movie and incredible ideas. But overall, I left feeling a little cold. Maybe because I figured out the ""twist"" half way through and spent half the movie trying to figure out what it was all building to. Then we got three different endings.  


I think my problem with the movie is that ""The Young Woman"" feels like the strongest and most compelling figure. But then we learn she's not real, or she's imagined based on a real person. Then she sort of disappears. Like I said, we get three different endings, but she doesn't play an active role in any of them.   


I guess the start of the movie pulled me in with the mystery of what exactly was Jake's relationship with the woman. But then it turned out the woman didn't exist, and it was all about Jake or the janitor I guess. It's definitely interesting, but it leaves me a little cold.   


I still think it's a real marvel of a film and I'm so glad it was made. It's wonderful to have a movie that inspires critical thought. We need more movies like this. But I'm not sure how I can recommend this movie to friends and family given its strangeness and my own mixed emotions.  


Then again, I also didn't know what to do with  Synecdoche, New York  when I first saw it but after further reading and rewatching it's one of my favorite. I'm interested to see how I'll feel about this movie in a week.",imqf5b

If the girl is just a figment of Jake's own mind and Jake then how/why did ""the girl"" (AKA Jake's mind's depiction of a girl he met decades ago) have that SJW reaction to him singing Baby it's Cold Outside? The ""that is a rape song"" theory was not topical when they met nor does it seem like something a mild-mannered 70-year old school janitor in some small midwestern town would had heard since and subscribed to, and even if he heard it why would he assign that SJW thought process to this girl he's been holding on a pedestal for years?

Aside from that this was the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting, directing, cinematograpy, set design, etc was all great but the script was so bad that it was excruciatingly painful to sit through.

The pig was simply a hallucination he had when he was close to death, almost leading him to the other side if you will. You’ve got me thinking , though. I also thought the rotting pig was symbolic of depression. Depression eats at you from the inside.

g4amdzk,"There are many types of movies. This was confusing, weird, tedious, a little smug and definitely divisive. And for me this is Kaufman's least accessible to date. I appreciated what Kaufman and especially Buckley did here but it was pretty esoteric and I thought at times I as a veiwer was supposed to be solving a puzzle, and not in a good way.

If I hadn't of read the book I would have completely been like wtf is going on, I just don't think it was a great movie. It was great film making...but as a whole not a great movie.

Since they're familiar to everyone as (most) people watch their parents age and die. But then I realized I was wrong after the ice cream scene and I am in the same boat as you. I just try to interpret movies and enjoy the art in them but rarely get the message on my own without researching other people's perspectives/interpretations. 

But, remember this: art is for the reader to absorb, appreciate, and take whatever message speaks to them. I try to take away whatever it is that speaks to me any time I'm enjoying art and almost always learn something new about myself. Aging may not have been the main point of this movie but I am now processing the thoughts of how scary aging is, inevitable, and the fact that humans have the ability to knowingly watch it happen.",imqf5b

g4gjde3,"This is a really great analysis of the movie, very well written.

I would add to that also that the young woman is simultaneously his ideal woman version of the one he saw at the trivia night and never got her number but she also at the same time himself as when she says ""I'm thinking of ending things"" this reflects his suicidal thoughts/intention all the while making it seem as if it's just her thinking of breaking up with him. This is also suggested by the moment at the house when she sees a picture of a child that looks like him but also as herself and even thinks that it is a picture of her as a child. 

It's interesting that this idealistic fantasy woman he imagined for himself is super smart but not as smart as him (frequently he references things she doesn't know, books she hasnt read, she didn't know certain words he used when they supposedly met etc). She's also a feminist who calls him out and makes him rethink certain ideas (the ""Baby it's cold outside"" moment), and finally even in this fantasy she is thinking of breaking up with him and he is aware of it.

I think the overall theme of the movie can be so many different things from time/ageing, lost opportunity, the ideal version of ourselves that we will never reach, loneliness, etc etc. I will admit though I only got some of it while I was watching and definitely had to go online to understand it properly but it is a very interesting movie, definitely makes you think.",imqf5b
g4nvglx,"“It’s more about letting depression and anxiety take control of your life.” 100 agree.

When she explores Jakes childhood room there are a bunch of black dvds with labels on them: futile efforts at success, lost/abandoned friendships, lasting memories of sorrow, unforgettable mishaps, the ways people have looked at, missed opportunities, humiliation, lost hope, recurring dreams of failure, and two others that move too fast for me to read. 
The father after says that his memory is going so they’ve taken to labeling around the house.
In Jakes brain these are the “dvds” in high rotation, easily accessible, and marked.
Jake says he watches too many movies and she says it’s a virus changing us into itself, replacing real thoughts with false ones. 
When someone struggles with depression, the memories that are more easily accessible are the painful ones, usually playing without permission, because our emotional state is unearthing memories of similar emotion, like a smell or taste would. This feeds the downward spiral. As his memory starts to go, he only labels the bad “dvds”. The first memories to be lost are positive ones, never revisited.
So now he has a life tinged to be that of a failure, someone mocked, someone looked at, someone forgotten and isolated. 
He also talks about an artist committing suicide, how that becomes their legacy, they become cautionary tales. He literally becomes one by the end of the film. By the end credits he’s about to be discovered by a plow truck, his art soon to be discovered as well I assume.

Anxiety probably had a lot to do with the missed opportunities and the reoccurring dreams of failure dvds. But I just focused on the depression part to stop my rambling.",imqf5b
g4tjb37,">how the relationship could have worked out. This accounts the various changes in the Young Woman's character throughout the movie. He always fantasizes that she is intelligent and creative. Sometimes this means that she is a poet, sometimes a painter, sometimes a physicist, but she is always idealized in some way.

To add onto this, in the scene where they’re explaining how they met, the young woman (who has seemed very intelligent and quick witted up until this point) uncharacteristically starts stumbling over her words and has trouble explaining how they met, and also starts taking on the mannerisms of the mother which makes Jake extremely uncomfortable.

g4khr8o,"Honestly, read the book. I read it in a day and it’s probably my favorite reading experience ever. I would be very disappointed if I were Iain Reid.

There is a cop/detective narrative weaved between each chapter that I thought was essential (for some reason that was cut). The books publisher insisted on this narrative being in the book (it was not in the original manuscript) to bring some sense of grounding to the story.

The movie was nonsense and trash in my opinion. Went from being art to random shock value quickly. The book has no musical, no naked man. The song is also an old country western tune (not Oklahoma), and has a twisted way of reflecting the character’s thoughts.

The characters are also switched in the book - the male is generally the one who rambles to the point of annoyance, the female is generally very quiet. The biggest change to me, which was the main appeal of the book, was that the last half took place entirely inside the school. It was a *very intense* man hunt from the janitor who is trying to trap and capture the couple.

When the book ended I stared at the wall for 5 minutes, it just hits you and you rethink everything you just read. The movie leaves you thinking “wtf?” but out of pure shock value. It didn’t provoke thought the same way the book did.",imqf5b

But of course, Jake was/is an old man fantasising, or perhaps his synapses were firing off in the last beats of life. So he was in his past, the ""girl"" was modern as he is, as a janitor, surrounded by young people who use modern technology. So I don't think this was an aesthetic Kaufman was going for, it was a wonderfully clever blend of two lifetimes.

Again, this is probably so obvious to most people. But I finished watching it about 20 minutes ago and I'm really digesting it... Loved the beginning so much. Felt an almost horror vibe, even, with a touch of comedy. Then wondered if the girl was hallucinating or drugged by the family dinner...

Then it dawned on me, we've not heard a single personal insight from the girl. We see everyone around her, Jakes family, warp and change ages and time lines but she stays the same

After realizing Jake and the janitor are the same person and everything was his last fantasy before he killed himself, all the scenes with the old janitor being alone watching a romance movie and a musical just makes me feel so sad and I think that’s what movies should do, to make people feel for the characters, and I really didn’t care for fantasy Jake at all but he took up the majority of the film.",imqf5b

g45758i,"I was fine with those changes because I thought ending of the book landed really poorly the way it was written. I like that Kaufman abstracted the reveal and kind of diffused it throughout the whole movie to make it less of a capital-T Twist. ""This character was a figment of their imagination all along"" is a pretty boring twist when the twist is the point, or when it's a big reveal or gotcha moment, so I appreciate that it isn't really meant to be absorbed that way in the movie version.

100% this movie isn't aiming for horror in the same way as the book, so it's hard to call it a failure of living up to what the book delivered...if he wanted it to be a horror finale, he probably wouldn't have included the interpretive dance or cartoon pig. He just definitely had different goals. I totally get not enjoying that version as much, but personally I thought it was a more interesting conclusion than what the book gave us.",imqf5b
g48xkhm,"That's a great take on the film. I haven't read the book and I still had the same thought halfway through, which was that all the unsettling stuff would have hit way harder if Jessie Bucket's character was acting like a real person and not just going along w/ the symbolic stuff like it was nothing. Being a Kauffman movie, I guess it's to be expected that the traditional storytelling elements of the book were thrown out the window for the film. This is the same guy that made a movie where a woman lives in an apartment that is on fire for years and never seems bothered by it (Synedoche, New York).

I love Kauffman and I think he's one of the most creative, interesting screenwriters of all time, but I do think he needs a producer/director/creative partner to pull his head out of the sand at times and force him to compromise *a bit* in his scripts. Not *everything* about traditional storytelling is bad and must be subverted, and some concessions have to be made for the sake of drama/stakes/etc if you want an audience bigger than yourself and your 3 most die hard fans who don't mind sitting through an hour long monologue about John Cassavetes where you can barely make out the actors faces because of the amount of snow falling on the car.

Kauffman's best movies for me are the ones he didn't direct (Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine, Malkovich) and presumably had someone to keep him from going full Kauffman. This one ranks along with Anomalisa and Synedoche, New York as 'filled with brilliant potential, but too inaccessible to actually be great'.",imqf5b

g4b4nh9,"I didn’t read the book and only saw the film.. and I definitely empathized with the girlfriend character, and while I did note that we were in a surreal world since the beginning I was not aware of what was real or what wasn’t and really the only thing keeping me grounded to some sense of reality was her. 
It’s pretty thought provoking and a bit sad... I enjoyed it.",imqf5b
g4cg23b,"For me, when the creepy nonsense elements occurred with little to no reaction from the girlfriend it fucked with my mind more. Yes, it makes the eventual truth more obvious—that the girlfriend is in the guy’s mind. But it gave me goosebumps to see her navigating all this crazy shit to sometimes be bothered and sometimes be blasé. I think that with more shuffling of the book’s story elements the movie is less predictable and more unsettling.",imqf5b

g4ax3w7,"I totally agree! The whole time the main character is discovering oddities and coincidences going on around her which puts the reader on edge. Even the long monologues in the book are a bit better and you can look back and see the thread that is being teased. 

I like Charlie Kaufman movies, but I really wish this had a bit more of the terror/dread from the book.",imqf5b

g4b1q0m,This is an incredible analyst and I couldn’t put it any better as someone who has also read the book. I purposely didn’t start this movie last night at 11 PM because the book terrified me so much at points where I stopped reading it at night but the movie chose to drop that aspect,imqf5b
g4b9bix,"The entire movie I was either scared, uncomfortable, or confused. I feel this strange psychological horror still succeeds in being horror even though I was looking for the meaning of each scene extensively. I very much feel that he was looking to make something dread inducing, scary, strange, and symbolic, and I feel he did just that.

While I did not relate to the protagonist, I did feel scared for her. I don't relate to her because she doesn't act how I would act in pretty much any scene. She's a weird, strange anomaly, but I could always be scared for her and worry for her safety. I wondered if Jake was going to kill her at the school and dread filled my body on the car ride there.

I don't know. I felt Kaufman sacrificed her relatability and groundedness for utter confusion. I don't think that's worse than what the book did, but I feel it's different and I understand greatly preferring the book's take.

That said, I would love to see another film adaptation that more closely resembles the book.",imqf5b

g4th0n7,"The movie just became a commentary on mental health rather than a mostly straightforward horror like the book was. We still get the sense of not knowing what was real, but in more of a “David Lynch/we’re not going to get a real answer out of this movie” kind of way.",imqf5b
g4ybmgp,"This is definitely a fair issue to have the film but I’d like to share my thoughts on certain things you brought up. To me it makes sense that she would appear as an oddity because she’s not real. She’s the culmination of women from Jake’s life that he’s fantasied about. The audience shouldn’t really be able to understand her character because it’s not one who has a set background, job, name, clothing, hair, glasses, or even accent. The protagonist should really be viewed as Jake/the janitor since we’re in his head for pretty much all of the movie. Every character, despite how different and nuanced they might feel from him, is really him thinking or remembering.",imqf5b
g5b9dt3,I got halfway through the movie and was struck by the fact that she seemed to be fine with all the bizarre shit that was happening. I figured I just wasnt suspending my disbelief enough. Would have been better if it was closer to the book as you describe it.,imqf5b
g8452qi,"Just to expand on what the user said below, Kaufman felt having a big ""twist"" was really cheap and felt like a ""dated"" trope. I believe he states as much in his interview.

So I also understand how the twist was broken up into digestible pieces and was really more of a slow understanding than a ""OH GOTCHA"" and suddenly it's all stabby.",imqf5b
g8rrxvz,"I think we get Kaufmans take on that with the whole ""if there isn't a sad person in the painting then how am I supposed to feel sad"". We relate to the woman to an extent, but it's not about that, well this film version isn't about that. It's about this broken fantasy, a deteriorating mental state that we can only sit back and watch, we don't think its real because the janitor KNOWS its not real. That's just my initial take anyway having just finished it.",imqf5b

g4xhex5,"FWIW I don't think she really shifted into a bunch of different mannerisms? I'm pretty sure it was intended to be a Pauline Kael critic from start to finish. When she gets interrupted she kinda falters, and goes back to her more ""typical self"" (whatever that means in this movie), but I think her ""act"" in that scene was basically just a specific imitation of Kael's distinctive mannerisms.

It's a genuinely funny impersonation, and yeah, once it clicks that basically he's just a dude who liked that movie, and feels kinda cowed by this aggressive critic who tore apart a movie he likes,  and all he can say is basically ""Well, I dunno, it resonated with me"", and it's been bothering him for decades since... weirdly relatable. Like sometimes people have a brutal analytical argument you can't really rebut, it's just that the movie works for you anyways.",imqf5b

gevt7dk,"I know this is quite a late reply, but I only saw the movie recently and wanted to get out some thoughts.

After Jake and his girlfriend left the house, I kind of stopped enjoying it and found it too vague/surreal (although I was prepared to an extent after seeing *Synecdoche, New York*). I lost my patience a bit and found it a little pretentious.

But thinking about it afterwards improved it a bit - I already had the sense that Jake was actually the protagonist, and that he was the janitor with the movie taking place inside his head. And after I learned that the dance scene and ending song were from *Oklahoma!*, the dialogue about 'crappy movie ideas' infecting people's minds and the Oscar Wilde quote both acted like keys of sorts to unlocking what the movie was trying to say.

I think it's a good movie to watch, and I'd like to revisit it. Just wish I had seen/heard *Oklahoma!* beforehand to offset the feeling of 'WTF is this dance?' and 'Why is he singing?'.",imqf5b

ghreevt,"For me, that was the point in the movie that I realized that the young woman is a projection of Jake. She's just spitting out things he has already read and taking on careers he once dreamed of. Going back and watching the movie again, I saw in Jake's childhood bedroom all of the books they discussed and realized that the young woman isn't a real person. I definitely agree it could have been shorter, but it did help me understand that the young woman was just an imaginary projection of Jake.",imqf5b
g42tga8,This was so painful and uncomfortable to watch. This article helps to clarify some of my confusion. I guess.,imqf5b
g477h2b,"I'm really frustrated with this movie! The reveal feels like kind of piddling and inconsequential versus the deeper themes of aging, identity, and memory being explored. And it leaves many of the weird elements free to dangle with no specific explanations, to the point that I feel cheated for being led to look for meaning in them.

I'm really enjoying reading about a lot of hidden meanings, but I don't feel there was a reasonable setup for the average intelligent viewer to appreciate them while watching. Like the only way to enjoy this movie is to consume a lot of external material after. Which is arguably a clever innovation, if it was intentional. But I still find that inferior to making a movie that leaves the audience satisfied at the end—or even after a few minutes of reflection, without having to consult outside sources.

Kaufman feels much more powerful to me when his premise is also inherently interesting: ""What if you could erase your memories, and the experience felt like living each erased memory over again in reverse order?"" ""What if you could spend some time inside someone else's POV?"" ""What if an adaptation was about itself?"" And here the fundamental premise seems to be ""What if you fantasized about someone?""

I'd say the premise is not ""What if your fantasy became self-aware?"" Because while that seems to happen, the self-awareness is not the cause of major events in the movie. Lucy doesn't rest do much about her situation. She's stuck as an observer. And so we don't get to see the implications of realizing you're someone else's fantasy. Which is a shame, because that's a premise I'd like Kaufman to more fully explore.

I feel like Kaufman has taken the opportunity to get less commercial, and has taken that too far, becoming inaccessible and losing the tidiness and ""sensicalness"" that makes his weird creative moves pay off so well.

But I'm happy for everyone who liked this more than I did. It's certainly a Charlie Kaufman joint.",imqf5b
g431s3l,"I appreciate your take, I watched this with my wife tonight and felt largely the same. I was close to hitting on what Kaufman was going for while watching it but never quite got there, that article helps a ton. My wife hated it, and I've subjected her to some very strange films over the years. I still think it's worth the watch but this isn't going to be a film I recommend to just anyone.",imqf5b
g455h6f,I really enjoyed the part at the parents house but found most of the car bits to be pretty dull but after reading this it gives me a much better appreciation. It was obvious Jake was the janitor but If I’m honest I had no clue the entire thing was a desperate fantasy in old Jakes head (I’m also a bit of an idiot). It honestly makes me look back on the movie in a much better light. It’s interesting to think back on the weird shit going on and realize it’s Jake trying to make everything in his fantasy perfect and failing.,imqf5b
g4318pq,"It was definitely confusing. I haven't read the book, but I believe where the movie has an interpretive dance scene the book has a large amount of exposition with the girl figuring out that she doesn't exist and the story is made up in his mind.

g42zsjm,"I feel it could have been a lot better, honestly.

I'd love to say this one just wasn't made for me, but it kinda... was? Or should have been?

I read the book and it remains one of my all-time favourite reading experience to date. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, another movie Kaufman wrote, is #1 favourite movie. And in general, I ***love*** slow-burn, mindfucky, weird, creepy films (like Midsommar or the Lighthouse).

Yet this movie just didn't do it for me. So I don't know what to think lol. By all accounts, this movie should've worked for me, but it really fell flat.",imqf5b
g42yb0y,"I am going to be harsher. This movie wasn't my thing either and I think you hit the nail on the head with the statement that it's a movie that's more fun to think about than actually watch. Cause it was a boring movie. I had an inkling to the true story but felt that it was too simple and started to try and grab something more interesting from the scatterbrained symbolism. Only for it to really be the thing I first thought. 

Here I was thinking it was gonna go horror with an abusive boyfriend, or a house stuck in time travel nightmare or maybe this is the girlfriend combing through the janitors fragmented memories as an advanced form of therapy? But nope, just an old man thinking about suicide. Does he do it? Who knows, choose your own ending! And I hate that. You just spent two hours jerking me around for the most brain-dead and unexciting explanation possible. Pretty much ""It was all a dream"" and the majority of the plot didn't matter. Of course you can dig into all the cryptic nonsense and try to formulate what the meaning behind it as to make your own interpretation of events but here's the thing. I don't care, cause this film never gave me a reason to care. So I ain't putting in the work to make a crap movie seem less crap.",imqf5b

g43ga05,"I really like most of Kaufman's stuff, but yeah this wasn't really up my alley. I had heard it was based on a book, but I didn't realize it would be one of those movies that you would need to have read the book beforehand to really understand.

I really enjoyed the first bit. Just them driving up to their parents house and then things getting weirder and weirder, but I was expecting it to be a horror type thing where they just never leave the house despite constantly talking about it....And then they just do, and it gets weirder but in a lot more of an abstract way that the longer it goes on just starts to feel more and more shallow. I understand that there is a reason for everything done here, but so many sequences just kind of felt weird for weirdness' sake, especially the interpretive dance at the end. I guess it fits the character thinking of himself as a very artistic and intellectual person, but just the way it presented with everything else it felt kind of bland. 

I found myself just wondering how much longer the movie would go on for by the time I got to the half way point. Compare that to Synedoche New York which was really long and surreal crescendo in a similar way, but what kept Synedoche more immersive to me was that no matter how bizarre things got, the core of the story was always effectively about a man trying to write his magnum opus while reeling from the loss of his wife and daughter...With this movie it was like it lost any semblance of a core story less than halfway through, and then it just became more and more abstract - which is fine, but just didn't suck me in. Reading about the book it's based on and what it all means is interesting, but I don't know I wish it was a movie I didn't need any supplemental material to really understand...",imqf5b
g45bljg,"I’m with you. I thought the whole sequence at the house was brilliant. The rest bored me to tears. I was dying for them to get out of that damn car and stop quoting poets and critics and such. I was so disappointed when they left the house after 20-30m and got back in the damn car. Great performances. I liked the tone. I just wish it had been more engaging.   

Kaufman didn’t direct Being John Malkovich, by the way. Charlie wrote, Spike Jonze directed. Same with Adaptation. Charlie’s directorial efforts tend to be a little more “out there.” I admire his work but it’s not for me, if that makes sense.",imqf5b

But the amount of essays that are being written here make no sense to me - I mean, they make sense sure, but I don't think this is the high art that people are claiming it to be. It's taken in with all this high dissection and it feels so alien to me. 

I don't want to be that guy but as soon as the janitor shows up I instinctively said ""oh it's all in his head"". And yeah, that's what it fucking was. 

When lesser directors/writers do this shit it's called out for what it is, but when Kaufman does it it automatically warrants paragraphs upon paragraphs of intense discussion. 

I wish it was more like the book. I wish we got some sort of pay off, but everything about this thing was alien and down right frustrating.",imqf5b
g442wlf,"Same. But I did enjoy 'mother' which was similar in tone

g4efegd,"This is a lot of how I feel. It’s very frustrating that with movies like these you’re very pressured into having to love them or else you can instantly get tossed into the “you just didn’t get it” category. 

It could be quite the chore to watch, there was a large large chunk of the movie that was just essentially two close up shots with the screen obscured by falling snow. Regardless of your analysis staring at that for an extended period of time is not exactly enjoyable. I feel like people think it is either one or the other in terms of artistic or “entertaining” but Kaufman has proven in the past that he can make movies that are abstract art pieces open to analysis while also having it be engrossing to watch and an enjoyable entertaining experience. So to act like these are somehow mutually exclusive ideas I think is silly. 

Right from the jump I thought that Jake and the old man were the same person and the during the parents visit caught on that they were all the same person, yet I feel like the pacing of the rest of the movie was as though it was slowly revealing those facts despite the film having already shown it’s hand much much earlier. There are additional details revealed about his life and these sort of daydreams, but ultimately I was expecting a more profound unraveling towards the end with all of that slow build up.",imqf5b

I guess I appreciate how many different interpretations people are having for this movie, but I really enjoyed how instead of grounding the crazy visuals and inexplicable fantasy occurrences in reality (like Eternal Sunshine did, it was all in the ""dream"" world) you're meant to just sift through and piece together reality from fantasy the entire movie. With no big payoff.

This mirrors the janitor perfectly. His entire life has been trying to piece together and separate fantasy from reality, which in the end he fails to do essentially, and there is no big payoff because there isn't one for the character either.

A life of consumption and no creation is hollow. His shyness and regret of not asking the girl out on trivia night matches his shyness of not sharing his own work with the world. In his mind he touted himself as a greet artist, poet, etc., but only in that he never shared his work with the world to be critiqued. His fear kept him from living the life of those he adored.

g5c2w6m,"My only disagreement is Curly doesn’t “kill” Jud in the end—or at least saying it that way makes it sound like Curly is the aggressor. Jud attacks Curly, typically starting with fists (depending on the choreography) before Jud pulls a knife and tries to kill Curly. Curly evades and Jud falls on his own knife. The town has an immediate “trial” and proclaims Curly not guilty of killing Jud.

Why does this matter? There is extra resonance in the use of the ballet in the film because in the musical, Jud is also a “dreamer/poseur” who keeps saying he’s going to get his life together and get the the girl and achieve his dreams—but then he does nothing except fantasize about his success. In the film, the young Jake represents the hero Curly-archetype who is successful, while the janitor represents the Jud-archetype who is just a fake dreamer with no real future. So it’s another parallel that the “poseur” Jud later kills himself on accident when he falls on his own knife after picking a fight with Curly—which lends credence to the argument that the “poseur” janitor also kills himself on accident by getting hypothermia.",imqf5b
g42nehd,"She absolutely does turn into the Robert Zemeckis movie girl, I had to rewind it to make sure I wasn't going crazy.

Maybe because the whole trip was just in the janitor's mind, it was just a misplaced memory of a swing set that was actually in his backyard?",imqf5b
g42menl,2  There is one scene with the janitor looking outside seeing this swing set at the beginning.,imqf5b
g42pcn6,"At the beginning of the movie, Jake seemed upset that the young woman questioned why the swing set was there and before I realized what was going on, I thought he had bought the abandoned house and was sad that she didn't seem to like the house. Now that I've watched the whole movie, I think that may still be true, but that it is a fantasy house. 

It may also be related to how stuck Jake is in his childhood, yet he himself is old and ""abandoned.""",imqf5b

2. I haven't got a clue either.

Still trying to figure it all out",imqf5b

g43u4l6,"The film jumps around in time of the janitor's memories.

I assume he remembers driving past that house when he was young and it was lived-in with a nice swingset but as time went on it became abandoned.

So it's an early hint that the movie is a mish-mash of his past and present memories.",imqf5b

g45i9t6,"The girl from the Zemeckis movie does turn up in the car, connecting to the David Foster Wallace theory about “beautiful people in television” which Plemens quotes as a projection of his insecurity. Jake sees his relationship with Buckley as a romanticized form of a Zemeckis movie with a happy ending, or like the characters in Oklahoma! That’s also why his and Buckley’s characters get replaced by more attractive actors in the dance sequence, until Jake’s actual self (the uglier janitor) battles with his fictionalized self and disrupts the dream. The song Jake sings at the end of the movie is also from Oklahoma!, but in the play, it’s sung by the “evil” character who’s being rejected by the woman he wants (at least that’s what I read from the synopsis of the play, not entirely sure that that’s 100% what happens in the play).",imqf5b
g4bc79k,"so Lucia and Jake are the two voices inside janitor's own head. when you followed their dialogue closely you can tell that Lucia is the voice of pragmatic(reasoning) while Jake is the voice of  romantic(more emotional), like right brain vs left brain.

ib972dd,Jakes mother’s comments mocking him is just jake mocking himself basically. There all his own thoughts constantly demeaning him. Sometimes the father would say jakes a nice boy or something but mostly his thoughts were negative which makes sense,imqf5b
i84jzt1,"Well and the whole time he was basically saying no one is different from each other, but at the same time everyone is living their own narrative. So crazy.",imqf5b
g427br6,"(Book spoilers below!!) So glad to read a comment from someone who has read the book, and I completely agree with you! I loved how everything was handled up until the school, and then like you I expected the school to be terrifying, because it is in the book... but it just wasn’t. I was honestly really disappointed in the movie’s ending as I’m one of the people who really loved the book ending! 

I’m also curious why it wasn’t more obvious that it was all in Jake’s mind with his multiple personalities etc. Obviously schizophrenia was hinted at - it was mentioned a few times, and the ending speech is from *A Beautiful Mind*, but I still don’t feel like it was as obvious as the book, and because of that I’m seeing a lot of people interpreting it as something else, like a time loop etc?? 

Finally, since Jake/The Janitor didn’t commit suicide, the constant line “I’m thinking of ending things...” doesn’t have that amazing impact that it has in the book, which again was a bit disappointing. I loved that moment when you realise it’s about suicide, and not a relationship ending.",imqf5b
g426lbu,"Suicide makes sense, or maybe dying from hypothermia inside the car? Meaning that the whole movie is a hallucination in his dying mind. It also explains why the old man got naked in the car, a common thing people do when dying from hypothermia because they feel extremely warm before they die.",imqf5b
g4295nu,"I also thought it was great at channeling the tone of the book up until the school, but from there I was just left disappointed. I'm usually not one to bitch about how film adaptions are handled, but I really enjoyed this book and I'm having a hard time not comparing the differences. I loved the dread I got from the school and the ending when reading the book, it's the only book that's unsettled me while reading it. But this didn't have that energy at all and it greatly disappointed me. And maybe it's because I was caught off guard by not being unsettled but I didn't think it was all that clear that the woman and Jake were in the janitor's mind. It also didn't give me ""ending things"" vibe as much as just a giving up vibe. I was very excited to recommend this movie to everyone like I do with the book but it left a bad taste in my mouth. Now I understand what my partner feels with him always complaining about how the GOT series ended lol, completely let down.",imqf5b
g42pj07,This is exactly how I felt. I was super let down. Everyone should read the book. The book left me thinking about it for weeks. The movie was disappointing. I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't read the book but I am happy to have read the book first because I loved it.,imqf5b
g427mt1,"I both read the book and just finished watching the movie. In my opinion, the book ending was cheap, and translated to the screen would’ve dropped the whole thing a few tiers making it just another run-of-the-mill thriller. It’s the “TWIST!” you’d expect from a thriller of the early 2000s.



In fact, the book wasn’t all that great to begin with, stylistic and writing-wise. I almost always like the book better than the movie, but in this case, it’s the opposite. The book was just very simple. Kaufman’s take on it leaves you pondering a lot. It’s much more thought-provoking because it is subtle and never cheap. This is the kind of work that you’d get different things from the more you rewatch.",imqf5b
g42rkir,"I think when the pig leads the janitor into the school, the janitor is still alive at this point and is being brought to the auditorium, where I assumed he commits suicide on stage. The whole acceptance speech and singing sequence is both absolutely what you said and also an abstract representation of him killing himself.",imqf5b
g430j2h,"As somebody who hasn't read the book, I would have probably liked the movie more were the school more like what you've described. The interpretive dance thing really threw me off and I didn't understand what had happened till reading a synopsis of the book. The whole movie was very unsettling, but the hallway dance scene felt kinda tacky.",imqf5b
g43b4q2,"Totally agree. I was so disappointed in the basement scene in the house. The way the basement and the painting area is described in the book is terrifying; one of my favorite parts, but there was none of that. I figured Charlie Kaufman would do his own thing with this adaptation, which I was excited for, but it seems like he just told the same story in a more pretentious way. I thought the book was fine on it's own.",imqf5b
g466kns,"This encapsulates a lot of my feelings too, having read the book before watching the film. I get the feeling that Kaufman either wasn’t comfortable with the gory turn of events at the end (I’ve only seen *Eternal Sunshine* and *Anomalisa* so idk exactly if he’s done other visceral films) or for artistic reasons disagreed with the book’s ending and decided to go a more abstract route.

In some ways I think both the book and the movie present examples of how to do conclusive and inconclusive endings well. The book is very tight and satisfying with how it wraps up, revealing everything and even introducing a bit of metanarrative. The movie teases out a lot of potential endings (suicide, death by exposure, he lives) and thus gets people talking. I suspect the movie will likely outlive the book due to this, even though I agree in preferring the book more.",imqf5b
g42hbnj,"Haven't read the book, but I looked up the plot summary on Wikipedia after finishing the movie and I'm glad Kaufman stayed away from the book revelation here. I'm sure the book executes it in an interesting way It's, but reading it as a summary just seems like a cheap trick. It's funny in a meta way since the book ending seems exactly like one of the script ideas ""he"" makes fun of ""his brother"" for in Adaptation. The dance scene seems like an elegant way to include that revelation without making it explicit.",imqf5b
g42vh6o,"I liked the book and film, but the book has a lot of pros the movie doesn’t have (flashbacks, the stalker, a glimpse at their “relationship”, genuine scares, a neat explanation, consistency) and the film has a lot of cons the book doesn’t suffer from (annoying abstraction, monotony). 

Overall the film is around a 6.5/10, while the book is a 7.5/10. Neither of them I loved, but the book is better imo.",imqf5b
g439q5l,100% this. The tone and atmosphere leading up to the school were great. I found myself able to appreciate the innovations and nuances he took with the story and characters. Then everything just went in such a bizarre direction with the last third that I didn’t experience anything close to the same ever-ratcheting sense of dread and anxiety that the final third of the book instilled. The entire performative dance piece totally undercut all the build up of the first two thirds.,imqf5b
g4krphm,"I hated the book's ending, but as a horror novel, the school was terrifying and easily its most memorable segment, so I was also very let down that the school in this psychological horror movie was nothing scary, and didn't go for that vibe at all. 

A part of why it worked in the book is that by the time we reach the school, there's only hints at things being wrong, but otherwise, we're in a real place, a real world, with humans, real stuff. In the movie, very early on there's too many cues that this whole world isn't real and it's a fantasy, and it's hard as fuck to feel fear for characters that you're constantly reminded are just characters. You don't even think they're gonna get scared, or that they can get scared, as their emotions don't follow logic, but only follow the fantasy that they're in.

As the book ended with a predictable gotcha plot twist, I get why, to be comfortable with it, Kaufman decided to make it more vague, more heady, to hide it under several layers of symbols, but I think the only actual solution was to ditch the plot twist outright if you think stating it at all would ruin your version of the movie, so you don't have something you're dancing around during a whole movie, and instead, dance to your own beat freely (which he does in spots, still constricted by a story he seems to want to shy away from but can't).

As much as I think the book's ending kinda ruined the good parts of it for me, at least it felt like a cohesive, constant story by a single author. The movie feels like a remix of how Kauffman would want to ""fix"" a story that's fundamentally incompatible with his style by removing the best aspects of it and treating the rest with a makeover that just works halfway for fans of the book, and halfway for fans of Kaufman, but that doesn't add up to a whole.",imqf5b
g42p1x4,"I agree with you wholeheartedly, the dance sequence was cool and all, but I loved how the book just amped up the dread even more with the school sequence. The whole drive to the DQ, then the school, and just how isolated that setting was, it was incredible. Here, I dunno, just felt like the air was sucked out in terms of atmosphere. Of course, it's not a surprising direction coming from Kaufman, his love for theatre and performance ultimately take the replacement",imqf5b
gj688b0,"With you on the boring part - in my opinion there is no reason for a work of entertainment to be boring, and this movie did get there for me, so that sucked.

However, I do think the movie came together at the end in a cohesive way. I was able to pick up (without checking the internet, as I sometimes have to do) that Landry from Friday Night Lights was also the old man at the school, and he was having memory problems. The main character is made up/pieced together from his shattered memories. All of that worked for me and made sense, so the movie ultimately was enjoyable for me, thought there were definitely boring parts!",imqf5b

>I really loved this movie.  
The way they represent the internal dialog/fantasies this ordinary man creates to avoid contemplating suicide is heart breaking. Love how the quirk and close to nonsense dialog and behavior at the beginning becomes so dark and charge with emotion at the end (let alone after a second view). Same goes to the performances.

>The final moments of the film where his fantasies turn into delirium due to the  hypothermia, and he has this hallucination with the pig, which tell him that basically he got to be one the pigs, one of those who die alone, who lived alone with no one aware of his suffering, just like the pigs eaten alive by maggots due to abandon... Man, if that isn't an existential tragedy!

>Charlie Kaufmann is such an original and genuine writer. Those doubts, fears and fantasies are so elemental and universal (at the end, must of us are going to be one of the pigs). The representation of this struggle, of the fantasies we create to ourselves in order to accept our existence was devastating. 

>In the final frame of the movie they let us answer the aforementioned question: how a painting  can be sad with nobody looking sad in it? Well, like the young woman said at one point: it is sad if you imagine yourself in it. Genius.

ghrdhq9,"I do think that in the end, the janitor does kill himself. He locks himself in a freezing car and stays there until he dies - the symbolism with the pig at the end was to demonstrate that he had, in fact, died and was ""joining the pigs."" Additionally, the body can trick itself into feeling very, very hot when hypothermia is fully setting in, which is a further demonstration that the janitor is dying. Maybe that's not how he dies in the book, but I think it's an interesting and unsettling way to tie back to the frozen, dead lambs used as a plot device earlier in the movie to represent Jake's inability to process his traumatic childhood filled with death and decay. From what I've heard, I agree with you that the movie and book are very different, and perhaps if I had read the book I would feel differently about the movie.",imqf5b

g42o5bv,"Jake can seemingly hear her thoughts, to an extent. This happens so often that I'm pretty sure it's indicating that he has some metaphysical connection to her (i.e. that she's a construct of his mind).",imqf5b
g43hwk8,"I feel kind of the same way. I was picking up on all the ""hints"" throughout, but to me it never became clear that she was a version of some girl he wanted to ask out. The bit with her picture on his wall and him trying to say it's a picture of him seemed like it was going in a different direction. I don't really get why her being this idealized version of this girl he fawned over would symbolically translate to a childhood picture of her on his home. I also think the big focus of the farmhouse and how the parents sort of traveled through time as they stayed there gave off a different impression to me. Again, why would this idealized version of her experience this time skipping parents all in that one night. It came across like it was trying to go in a different direction, and that the movie was more just about aging and dealing with commitment issues expressed through this nightmare scenario of being thrust into an overly intimate situation with a soon-to-be ex-boyfriend while their parents unravel. It almost to me felt like that part of the movie went on too long and was focused on too much in the trailers for what the actual point of the movie was. I think in the back of my head, I was trying to piece together everything that happened afterwards with that first sequence in the farm house and that's why I missed this supposedly obvious idea of her being a fantasy.

Also on top of all of that the movie is primarily told from her point of view, which is an interesting choice and totally ""fine"" but because of it you don't really start to consider what's happening in his head until basically the last quarter of the movie (if that) where it finally shifts to be more of his perspective.",imqf5b

g47acmn,"I think it's safe to say everything was in Jake's imagination.

The only character with an origin and development is Jake/Janitor Jake everyone else exists to flesh out the figments of Jake's memory and to antagonize the viewer, mostly.

Ultimately, I think the film is about becoming old, forgetting, and eventually being forgotten told through a man with an inherited mental illness. Its like a really good Cortázar or Borges vignette.",imqf5b

g4d97kz,"TBH a lot of it seemed like nonsense to me. 

So she was supposed to be an invention of old janitor Jake, we can tell this because of hints like: he isn't allowing her to exist as a person, he is interrupting her, correcting her, repeating things - like thoughts in his own brain. The conversation is never about her and her past. A good example being never answering the phone from the friend. He doesn't know her friends or anything about her life, so she can never answer that phone, the call only exists so he can imagine himself telling her its okay to take it, right? 

Well then why have wierd traditional horror movie SPOOKUMS like his parents having a picture of her on the wall? The point is that she is an invented woman, a made up acheivement. She doesn't have childhood photos, she doesn't have a memory. So that shit is a total nonsense red herring. There were a lot of bits like this in the first half of the movie that I think really pointlessly threw you off the scent, and it all sort of seemed to lead to nothing. 

I guess its an inherent part of the film that its an anticlimax, but at the same time, who wants to watch a film that is essentially like a dissapointing dream? You wake up and the point of what FELT like something important seems to fall away, and you just sort of get on with your day and stop caring with maybe 20 minutes while you take your morning shower and shit of ""hmm, that was wierd lol"" before brushing your teeth feels more interesting and you forget all about it.",imqf5b

All the talk about seeing each other’s pasts, being unable to be in the moment, constantly reminiscing about failures and regrets, hoping and planning for better futures. Man, I was totally sold on all that shit. And when they got to the school dance scene I was like, oh, this is their ideal selves. This is what life could be if we were perfect. But none of us are and nothing is. I did piece together the Jake/Janitor thing and I saw that being woven through as self sabotage and regret or reality tainting fantasy. So, guess I was kinda close.",imqf5b

g53wb42,"Part 2:

- The nervous girl at the ice cream place tells Lucy to stay, that she doesn't have to go ""forward in time"" and that she's scared for her. This is Jake's mind trying to dissuade him from dying.

- Imaginary Lucy seems to become progressively more independent from Jake's thoughts as we near the end. She's become aware of her own odd existence. She recalls the visit to Jake's parent's as a blur; doesn't remember Jake helping his mother with the dishes, and doesn't feel like ""Ames"" is her name or nickname. This could also be a manifestation of Jake's own jumbled thoughts. His fantasy can't hold up for long against reality.

- Lucy and Jake finally disagree when talking about the movie ""A Woman Under The Influence"". While Jake has always corrected her before, he loses the argument for the first time and admits that Lucy is right; once again revealing Jake the Janitor's unraveling psyche.

- The movie mentioned reflects Jake's personality and struggles. Lucy explains that Mrs. Cassavetes is someone who wants to please everyone. The people around Cassavetes lack dimension, are flat (like Jake's caricatural portrayal of his parents at different ages). Lucy goes on with: ""it's unclear if the characters are unconscious or whether it's Cassavetes who's unconscious of what HE'S doing (a slip-up in pronouns). This is a sign that the characters are a figment of his imagination and that he is unaware of what he's doing.

- Jake gets frustrated when Lucy refuses to tell him what she's thinking about. She was realizing at that point that she seems to have seen Jake's parents as ""they once were, as they will be after they're gone"". She's become her own thinking entity, separate from Jake, and is looking at this night with a fresh perspective.

- Jake finally opens up and reveals his feelings about life : he refers to society as being ""alienating"", that growing old is hopeless, ""your body is going, your hearing, your sight; you can't see and you're invisible, you've made so many wrong turns.."" = again pointing to his loneliness, to feeling unseen. His regrets at the choices he's taken that led him here. He's nostalgic about youth, being healthier, hopeful..

- Jake makes peace with the fact that a person shouldn't blame their parents for the way they turn out and should take responsibility for their actions. This is him preparing himself for the biggest decision of all. Lucy then says at one point that people blamed mothers for a child's schizophrenia, autism, homosexuality.. Was Jake on the spectrum? (Aspergers maybe; he's bright but socially awkward, prone to outbursts of anger). Or was he a closeted homosexual?

- Cold is a big theme in this movie: a raging snowstorm, a cold house (Jake says that the floors are cold and that Lucy should wear slippers), his mother, ice cream, the book ""Ice"" by Anna Kavan... The coldness he felt in his life is ironically what he uses to kill himself by dying of hypothermia in his car. Lucy alludes to his demise by asking herself when alone in the freezing car: ""How long until you die of hypothermia?""

- ""Suicide becomes the only story"": this is what Jake thinks he'll be remembered as; an old man who killed himself. 

- Seems like Janitor Jake is a peeping tom as we see briefly when Jake and Lucy kiss in the car. Jake gets angry and gets out of the car to confront him. This shows guilt towards this behavior; anger and shame that he directs at himself. Maybe Janitor Jake watches students change in the locker rooms? Or maybe he feels like he's a peeping tom in his own fantasies.

- Janitor Jake tries to give Lucy his slippers again in the school. She realizes they are the same slippers that Jake gave her at the house. She smiles at the janitor and tells him to keep them, that they're his to have. I think this symbolizes how Jake tried to get validation from taking care of the people around him, at his own expense (his sick parents, giving Lucy his slippers in his house so she wouldn't get cold, while not having another pair for himself). Finally, Lucy tells him to think about himself for once. 

- His last song before being applauded summarizes his story: when he's alone and lonely, he starts dreaming that every thing he wished for came true, that he's successful, that a woman loves him.. but then realizes he's still all alone. 

- He said in his last speech, his last fantasy, that his greatest achievement as a physicist is realizing that love is what makes things logical. At the end of his life, he discovers that lack of love in his life led him to his death and says to the audience: ""I'm only here because of you. Because of all of you""; a sentence that can be read two ways. Even as he died, his last thought is that of validation as everyone gives him a standing ovation and he sobs happily.",imqf5b

g43b2u4,"I’m surprised it took me going this far down in the comments to see something like this.

g4fst2q,poop edits?,imqf5b
g4xj5th,"I definitely agree about the ""iterations of a creative process"" with regard to the young woman, or, more broadly, it's just the way that our fantasies are constantly shifting, but I think it's neat to put it more concretely in the terms of an artist/writer, because art is so important to the movie. 

But while that can explain the ages of the parents, I'm not sure that's the first thing I'd point to. To me, it's more that ages work weirdly in memory. Like, I'm in my late 20s, and if I think back to my memories as a kid, I really struggle to ""age down"" my parents 20 years. In those memories, they still look like people in their 60s, not their 40s. We remember the people, and then we project how they should look onto that.

So I'm not sure the intentionality of the creative process is strictly necessary to explain the parents ages. Rather, it's just very fitting for a guy working through a weird mixture of memory and fantasy. He's thinking back to his 20-something self, and he's seeing a mixture of what his parents were like at the time, and the weight of the memories of his parents decline (recent memories he feels much more sharply).

And very broadly, I think you can definitely read the different ""narrative inconsistencies"" as the imperfections of an ever-changing fantasy, or more intentional iterations on the creative process. I think both apply, depending on the inconsistency (as you say, some of them feel like intentional revisions, whereas others feel like ""mistakes"", like when he ""notices"" his own continuity error in the first time the young woman tells the story of how they met).",imqf5b

g9b17yq,"Don't think of the movie as memory of the Janitor but as a fantasy of the Janitor. When you hear both Jake and Lucy as just the voices of the Janitor, it gives a lot more meaning to Lucy's thoughts and actions.

When Lucy is thinking of ending the relationship, it is the Janitor thinking of suicide. When Lucy is screaming about her distaste for Jake, it is the Janitor's self hatred speaking that is both pushing him to suicide but also interrupting his fantasy.

At some points the fantasy is working out and Lucy is comforting Jake about Jake's mother deaths. At another points the Janitor's negative thoughts take over and Lucy is ranting about how much she doesn't like Jake. It is just conflicting voices from self hatred and regret from the Janitor",imqf5b

gdmkxmc,"I dont think its a masterpiece by any means but it definitely made sense

The jake/lucy arc is the fantasy of an old, lonely, depressed janitor (the real Jake). Hes picturing some amalgamation of different women hes known, or just observed, or in many cases pulled from media hes consumed, and fantasizing about a relationship. In his mind, this ideal is bringing her home to meet his parents, and afterward heading to the HS parking lot to steam up the car- its implied that hes peeped on students doing that. However, even in his own fantasies, he cant give himself what he wants- even this fantasy version of a girl (who is constantly changing names, outfits, personality, etc) knows that he's a creep, he's self obsessed, he wishes he was talented and smart but knows hes not, hes pedantic, hes tiresome to interact with. In the end, as even his fantasy woman is thinking of ending things with him, he is thinking of ending things (ie, he kills himself at the end).

Anyway theres also a ton of references to different movies, poems, and plays that are prominant throughout but the most notable one is Oklahoma! the musical. Which is where the dance in the hallway and the final song come from, and itself is about a creepy guy who lusts after a woman he cant have which ultimately leads to a self-imposed demise.

Again definitely no masterpiece- was more than a bit masturbatory at times with all the ""clever"" references and extensive dialogue, could have easily cut it down to like 100m and gotten the point across. But to me it for sure made sense, and I felt it was an interesting approach to a character study and ultimately successful at telling its story.",imqf5b

They say your life flashes before your eyes in the final moments of it. That is exactly what happened to Jake. He saw that ice cream commercial, an advertisement that was from a happier, simpler childhood. He loved that song.

The pig guides him to his death. He IS the pig. He fed it, didn't check up on it for too long, and one day he noticed something was terribly wrong. It had an infestation, an illness that was too far gone, and the only humane choice was to put it down.

The dance scenes were just another fantasy of his, where he self inserted himself into one of his favorite mediums, musical theater. He finally gives an acceptance speech and song. His mind comforts him by allowing him true happiness and everyone to witness it before the black sky becomes blue again, fading away the existence of Jake.",imqf5b

He will wake up that day, go into work at the school, see more kids that are growing up and leaving the town while he goes on, week after week, throwing away ice cream that he buys for no one, cleaning the halls night after night, and sitting in his car after his shift until hes on the verge of death, imagining where things went wrong and what could have fixed it.",imqf5b

Hmm",imqf5b
ie8jlc7,"Honestly, I love this explanation",imqf5b
g427j5a,"I agree with you that it was all Jake's fantasy.

Adding to this: I believe Jake was the janitor who thought of himself as a rotten pig. The scene where she talks to Jake in the car just before he leaves, about the song ""Baby it's cold outside"" and how it's rapey, and then when she describes Jake as a mosquito and how there's just too many interactions like that with men bothering her at bars...

Plus the scene at the ice cream place with the girls laughing at him and the girl who serves them talking about the meanness of pretty girls. Jake never gets over high school and mean girls mocking him and that's why he won't even approach the window and makes the girl go order for them. It also takes us back to the dinner scene with his mom being so happy he finally have found a girl!

Also the dance scene, I think it's the janitor thinking of what it could've been, and day after day looking at the youth (that Jake in the initial car scene mentions how much he admires) he wasted and wishing to go back.

And yea, I think she never gets a real name and changes jobs with every scene, because she was never real, just a sum of all the fantasies he had with women and insecurities he had about himself which never allowed him to have a real connection.

Besides the story and and the great ambiance (the wind, the snow, the farmhouse), Toni Collette steals the goddamn show every time.",imqf5b
g42bcy5,"I started thinking about the dog and how the only times we see the dog,  it's constantly shaking water off almost like a glitch.  Initially when they first called for the dog,  it wouldn't come but after a few minutes it just magically appears in the room they were just in.  

I think that because this fantasy is being constructed by the old janitor/Jake,  his memory of the dog has faded and it takes him a little while to conjure what I guess may be his only memory of the dog.  Or possibly the shaking is to obscure its face because he can't remember what it looked like at all.

There is certainly a rewatch in order.  All these little nuggets and theories I've read today have me appreciating it more and more.",imqf5b
g42aeqm,"> In that way it reminded me of Synecdoche, how the whole thing can be seen as a tale of regret.

g42ixfm,"Feel like you nailed a lot of my tip of the brain thoughts. It totally feels like Jake’s fantasy, he interprets the peculiarities of his parents and growing up through how he interprets the feelings of his girlfriend and this happens most of the movie I felt. Jake seemed to really have intense feelings of nostalgia for his life and I was assuming he was janitor pretty early on. He has high ideals of what he wants to be versus who he actually is and views his girlfriend to be substantially more intellectual than he is, even though she has plenty of more down to earth moments. The thing is, you’re never quite sure due to how the plot goes from 0-100 only about 30 minutes in and continues course with the unreliable narrator. 

I loved how he viewed her viewing the longevity of the relationship of his parents. Thewlis and Collette are fantastic here and really get to stretch their range. Really the whole cast was great and I loved how everything was framed.

gmvedeu,"Jake's definitely a disturbed character, he's thinking of ending things after all (if you didn't get that point) the whole film is from his perspective, his whole timeline, all his memories and every person he's encountered throughout his life. His strongest memories are those with his parents, childhood trauma, the classic memorabilia in his bedroom that is referenced throughout (Wordsworth, Pauline Kael etc) and the whole pig-maggot story. The girl he travels with and is supposedly dating isn't real, shes a girl he stared at in a bar, her wishing her bf was with her (sardonically it must be said), Jake imagines she is Lucy, a girl with no faults, an artist/physicist/beauty, everything he respects from the society that has indoctrinated us all embodied into this one figure. His memories (or ideals) are intertwined with the present day janitor jake, who watches romance and the local production of Oklahoma! Wishing his life had turned out differently, but like the Maggot filled Pig said ""Its the luck of the draw"". Ultimately the film ends with our Ideal & successful Jake living his dream, receiving his nobel prize in front of all his peers in the same vein as ""A Beautiful Mind"" before singing his favourite Oklahoma! tune and receiving a standing ovation. In reality our Creepy Janitor Jake kills himself in his truck, exposing himself to the elements and ending is mal sordid life. Ultimately the film is Jake's suicide note, on how hope is a manmade entity and that humans take the hollywood romance lifestyle for granted, all whilst our main character lives a life of solitude and isolation, unloved and unwanted but who still plays into societies dreams and ambitions.",imqf5b
hnke4w2,"Yes!! So I interpreted the movie indicating that Jake was kidnapping and killing young women. I thought that since he worked as a janitor at that high school, the “girl” was actually a victim he felt the most guilty about because it would come to be that she had a fiancée (who he possibly killed too)

Some examples:

1. The swing set - maybe he would pick them up from play grounds?
2. Scratches on the basement door
3. Constant mentions of chains
4. The rashes on the girls arms at the ice cream shop
5. The girl at the ice cream shop haha

First of all, the scene plays out right after the young woman confronts the janitor and tells him in no uncertain terms that she never actually pursued a relationship with Jake and even found him repulsive. Immediately after, the young woman and Jake meet face to face and are replaced by actors who perform the dream ballet, because their entire romance has been just that: an act, a fantasy.

g437ie0,"There were some great scenes but all together I disliked it. I think I would have liked it more if not for that fluffy ending. I loved the books ending how it ramps up to that aha! moment. I'm not digging this Oklahoma interpretive dance deal, like what even was that. The weird high brow references to John Cassavetes movies and whatnot was so boring. But the middle of the movie I loved, dinner scene was great even though it was different from the book. And all the little details changing I enjoyed. So awful piece of shit of course not it was great film making, but enjoyable re-watchable movie def no. Also preferred book because it was so creepy and bordering on horror, like when she's talking about her dreams etc. But I'm a huge horror fan so I may be biased and thats swaying my opinion 5/10.",imqf5b

She says they never even spoke.

I've lived with depression, anxiety, and loneliness at some level throughout my life, and would often find myself falling back on fantasies as a way to cope. I would fantasize about what could be or what could have been. Things I could have done differently that would have made my life better, or how things could potentially be better in the future.

I think the problem I had with this movie (even though I did enjoy it overall) is that it included aspects of the book that the movie never explains, which just confuses the viewer. 

I hate being that annoying “WELL IN THE BOOK THIS HAPPENED” person, but the book didn’t have a lot of the surreal moments and the twist that he made up these scenarios with this girl all comes to light in a very creepy encounter at the high school at the end. Which I was very much looking forward to. Instead we got a weird (although beautiful) interpretive dance and a monologue from a different movie at the end. 

Overall the experience watching it was entertaining, but I was a little disappointed for how the story was told. Felt like the movie was weird for the sake of being weird instead of telling the story in a way people would understand.",imqf5b
g52lep3,">This movie suffers immensely from false expectations.  It's not horror.  It's not creepy.  So that's why I didn't enjoy it.  Things kept being framed as ""something horrible is about to happen"" and nothing ever did.

gbga2n5,"Don't see what being white or a man has to do with it. It's more than a woman letting him down. It's that he's been underappreciated and looked down on his entire life by everybody, no just a woman. You kinda missed the point I think.

ib95xzq,"She’s he’s thoughts basically. She walks into the school and jake says his goodbyes to her (he’s embraced suicide and let’s go of his inner thoughts, she was always there to not let him step over that line we see it in scenes where she asks younger him to talk about his feelings and he cuts her off) 

This scene cuts to the “dance performance in the school” the two actors are in his head and resemble what he desired out of life with the peaceful music and the wedding. Then it gets dark and violent when the janitor attacks them (this is basically his thoughts hating himself even more he’s ashamed of how he never achieved happiness and his goals) then the actor dancer dies after getting stabbed by himself. The two main characters young jake and jakes thoughts ie the girl walk away from each other, a somber goodbye. 

Now jake the janitor has accepted his fate, he walks outside in the snowstorm and dies in his car. Everything when the cartoon appears isn’t real it could be an afterlife (the cartoons are representations of his life, the one about the ice cream and the pig with maggots he mentioned at the barn farm in the beginning of the film). He walks onto stage where he is old but looks the same as he did when he was younger (the film mentions countless times that jake hated being old he thought that youth was far better your more attractive, healthy, full of life ect. this could be a way to resemble that) The scene represents what he could have achieved or how he wanted to be recognised. The film ends with a fade to a blueish whiteish colour, that could mean many different things a common one being some kind of heaven? Not entirely sure. 

Anyway hope this cleared something up.",imqf5b

His tragic family goes on about how smart he is, so in his fantasy his girlfriend is deconstructing classic films while becoming the personas she critiques - because he thinks he’s that smart.

g5hjfyy,"Watch out, because this about to get very rambly and very spoilery.

""Lucy"" isn't real - she's a figment of his imagination, a fantasy he's having as he's going through his day. Everything is from Jake's perspective - all of her thoughts, which is why it seems like young jake can hear them - because he's the one thinking them.
Notice all the small inconsistencies in the movie - the color of their clothes changing, their hairstyles constantly changing, Lucy constantly switching her major when asked about by his parents, the way the paintings she painted and poem she wrote actually exist in the real world, and are found in Jakes room. Those are all (save for the last one) minor details that are hard to keep track of when it's all in your head.
And then the bigger things - the parents aging and deaging as Jake struggles to decide on which rendition of his parents to actually imagine; the dog, which is only seen shaking - the only thing Jake actually remembers it doing.
Things get progressively worse - or, better put, more *wrong* as the movie goes on because even in his own fantasy Jake can't get his own way. The imaginary situation he built for himself doesn't make sense, and he *knows* it, which is why the woman keeps arguing with him, finding him annoying and boring.

These are all off the top of my head, so it's mostly incoherent, but I'll be glad to discuss more about it if you have any specific questions :)",imqf5b

I've written another longer comment, but it's basically this older Jake's last day as he succumbs deliberately to hypothermia, while we see his train of thought. Thoughts of fantasy and anger and sadness. Some of them are probably pieces of memories and others made-up but based on experiences.

The girlfriend is not real, the parents did exist, but this is all his thought process on the last day of school before the weekend. Hence things he sees around the school (the pair dancing in the hall, the dialogue of the movie he's watching) inform the kinds of things he says in his mind. The weird visuals are the result of hypothermia setting in as he continues to 'dream'.

That's my take. I wondered why them driving in the car looked kind of fake, and I realize because it isn't real.",imqf5b

Of course at the end I realized that was wrong and could easily rewind through the film editing how I interpreted the scenes. In the end though, doesn't change my opinion. Didn't like it, super tedious, not funny, not really horror, just frustrating and finally depressing.",imqf5b
g5jysqu,"It's probably Jake dreaming. In real life he is the old janitor. When we dream, our mind exposes what we wanted to be true in real life, but is repressed in our inconscience. For example, when Jake and Lucy ( who doesn't exist ) stop by the ice cream parlor, we see the girls who humiliate him in real life as clerks. We also see one dark haired girl as a clerk telling Lucy that she doesn't have to go forward in time. That's because according to Freud, when we dream, the time flows differently: we mix memories from a long past with recent memories, in our own way. That's why we saw his parents getting older and younger many times ( the interesting is that Jake and Lucy mention Freud and objective reality ).

As for the basement, Jake didn't want Lucy to get there because this is where his brilliant paintings are hidden, and so are his janitor uniforms.

So in the book, at the end it is heavily implied/revealed that Jake (the Janitor) wrote the story as his condition deteriorated over some time. He lives in his parents' old house and is mostly isolated from people. At work (the school) he's mostly nonverbal, but writes about this idealized relationship that never happened, trying to decide if things could have ended differently. But he ultimately decides that she would have eventually ""ended things"" with him (broken up with him) so he decides to end things for himself.

g8ze8b8,"The entire movie is a lonely old man's fantasy about introducing his ideal girlfriend to his parents. He wants this to happen because, just like the young woman says, Jake is in need of approval by others. Her role is to approve of Jake. However, she also needs to be approved of by other people to validate their relationship. Thus, she needs to meet his parents, and his parents need to like her. 

However, the fantasy always remains ""imperfect"" because Jake is unable to come up with a scenario where his parents and his ideal girlfriend would mutually like each other, because they are essentially from two different worlds. Jake's ideal girlfriend is cute but not a barbie, an academic, but also sensitive and artistic. His parents are simple uneducated farmers with very... Traditional values, shall we say. His dad in particular: He doesn't give a hoot about art or academic achievements, the only thing he is interested in is sports. 
I get the feeling that Jake's father's dialogue was once directed at Jake himself, who is also a sensitive person who used to paint. That's why he gets so upset whenever homophobic language is used around him, and that's also the reason why he cannot come up with an ""ideal"" visit even after cycling through many different names, occupations, childhoods and interests for his ideal girlfriend, and finally ends up rewriting the narrative and lying to her about the visit having gone well once they're back in the car.

The dog is just another aspect of the ""imperfect"" fantasy. I get the feeling he never actually had a dog, Jake just made it up on the spot to explain away the scratches on the basement door. But since he never had a pet (nor any friends who owned a dog), he doesn't really have a good reference for dog behavior, and is having a hard time inserting it into his actual memories. Therefore, it awkwardly pops in and out of existence and does nothing but shake, because that's a thing that dogs do, right?",imqf5b

gk1s4n0,"I have a pet theory that Jake was actually sexually assaulted by his father. I think the ""nancy"" comment is his father projecting his own homosexuality.

I'll copy and paste from a post I actually just made about this movie:

My evidence for this is the scene where Lucy is in his childhood bedroom and the aged father mentions fucking on the child's bed three times, and also mentions several times how it's not meant for two. These lines are very strange without context.

>His mother and I aren’t old fashioned about those things. Fucking and what not.  
I mean you won’t be doing any fucking on this bed, I imagine. **It’s not made for fucking. It’s a child’s bed.**  
I know this bed is a little small for two... (searches for word) ... grown-ups. It’s a child’s bed, after all.  
It’s a child’s bed. And just for one child. Not two.

Not only this, but twice during the dinner scene Jake's mother makes a bawdy joke about how Jake's father is good in bed, but her nervous laughter immediately after suggests that in fact, the opposite is true. Almost certainly a sexless marriage. Also, how Jake's father seems keen to convince Lucy that he and his wife ""aren't old fashioned"" about those things. Yeah, right. So how did Jake's father get his sexual frustrations out?

Even if I'm wrong about the sexual assault, clearly this dialogue is suggesting *something*. Maybe he was assaulted by another child? ""It's a child's bed, just for one child, not two.""",imqf5b

g5lo0i5,"I think the stripping was both plot and thematic?  In terms of the story he’s dying of hypothermia. People who die that way often strip as they start to believe they’re too hot not too cold. 

But I think it’s a metaphor about vulnerability as well maybe. He’s giving up all his fantasy and the barriers between his unachieved dreams and the world. He’s naked, vulnerable, and dying because of it.

The dance is apparently from Oklahoma, a play that clearly weighs heavily on his mind. It’s a dance between two lovers and a man who covers the woman and stabs his rival. Here the rival is an idealized version of himself, the him he always wanted to be. He can’t live imaging that person anymore and the real person is ending the fantasy. I think there is also an aspect of time in that moment: he “killed” the opportunity to be his dream version of himself by staying the way he is. 

The song is also from Oklahoma, sung by the man who stabs his rival in the dance earlier. It’s very thematic, as it’s about loneliness, unrequited love, and hating ones self. I think, also, that he is a person who’s never really had a lot of “life experiences” for lack of a better word so all his internal monologue is taken from works he likes. His art is imitation of other art, the poem that she recites in the car is a real poem from a book on his bookshelf in his childhood room, the review of the movie she rattles off is from a review written by Pauline Kael.  It makes sense that his last moments would be interpreted through art.",imqf5b
g5k6183,"I don't have all the answers but I think I got these. 

The interpretive dance I'm shakey on, but it's a way of saying Jake saying to himself ""I could've been so happy with that random woman, but I'm such a shitty person."" I think. At least that's where I'm at now.

The pig I think I got though. Jake talks about that pig at the farm that was eaten from inside out by maggots. At the end he says to the pig ""I'm just like you"" or something. It's him telling himself he's an ugly person who's depression/self hatred is eating him from the inside out. I'd say the stripping is a metaphor for him baring everything to himself. Like he's not conversing through made up metaphors anymore, it's his true, horrible old disgusting self. He definitely dies in the car freezing to death though, so this is all in his mind.

The Wave is close, but just kinda has an unnamed psychedelic. Really liked both of those.

I have to say I didn't really like I'm Thinking of Ending Things quite as much, but I think that's because I was expecting more of a horror movie from the trailer. I feel like I might give it a rewatch though, as understanding what's going on might make it more interesting instead of confusing. I had a similar feeling when I first watched the movie Donnie Darko (which kinda could be seen as another DMT trip before dying movie).

I thought the portrayal of the confusion that a person with dementia or alzheimers feels, with time not meaning anything was good.  I think that the movie is extremely hard to follow and confusing because that is what their life and minds are like at that point.  A series of random points in time tied in at the moment.

There are some definite existential crisis/nihilism themes present throughout, culminating with the seeming suicide at the end. 

I do however, think this film is pretentious because it intentionally obscures these themes and plot points. 

When audiences go into a movie, there are certain basic expectations that they have. Chief among them is that a basic narrative structure is followed. If a film seeks to break this structure for the sake of artistic creativity, a certain level of payoff is then expected as a result of the subversion of this rule. In this instance, the lack of narrative structure hinders the expression of the themes present in the film and detracts from its meaning. 

There have been many examples of directors disrupting the traditional flow of time in a plot while providing a satisfactory payoff in the end (Memento comes to mind) but for all of the non-linear segments that this film provides, they don’t ultimately resolve themselves into a coherent narrative that seeks to make a statement.

While the atmosphere was certainly fantastically crafted and definitely made me feel a sense of unease throughout its runtime, I feel like this could have been thematically stronger through the use of narrative and lacked a serious punch.",imqf5b

>In “I’m Thinking of Ending Things,” the character endures that same struggle when the fantasy fights back. It’s a storytelling gamble unique to the art of cinema: Within the “world” of “I’m Thinking of Ending Things” — one controlled by Kaufman as well as his protagonist — Lucy exists. “I needed her to have agency for it to work as a dramatic piece,” Kaufman said. “I really liked the idea that even within his fantasy, he cannot have what he wants. He’s going to imagine this thing, but then he’s going to also imagine how it won’t work, how she’s going to get bored with him, how she’s going to not think he’s smart enough or interesting enough.”",imqf5b
g4o4ux0,"My thoughts on ice cream girl:

I think jake was able to relate to the unpopular girl at school and so she was cast when his brain needed the lifeline, Jake and icegirl both had rashes on their arms, only time we see Jakes rash, I think this is to show that she is his true inner voice here. She shows up when his thoughts are lost in the anxiety of being mocked by the girls and not being able to face it. Ice girl then gets the fantasy back on track, complimenting Lucy heavily, calling the other girls mean, and giving Jake something to relate with them on: maybe they have their own kind of suffering. 


Since I see the ice cream girl as Jakes young inner voice, mostly untinged, then it makes sense she would be concerned for their wellbeing. She isn’t the voice of doubt, anxiety, or depression but a voice of concern and appreciation. So she mentions the varnish. She says “that’s not really what the smell is, you know that.” I know the book has him working with varnish in reality but I don’t think he has to be, just a smell he’s familiar with. A strong chemical smell is what it is, and I believe it’s the chemicals he uses to clean the school, chemicals that could leave burns like the ones on their hands, put into a mop bucket and splashing onto the hands or something. So she is breaking the fantasy, to say hey be mindful of the fumes your inhaling and chemicals your mindlessly handling atm. She only breaks the fantasy briefly though, as if concerned not to say to much. 

Once jake is making it to the car the ice cream girl is suddenly scared for them and told her they could stay they didn’t have to go forward. I took that as his subconscious voice trying to help and stop them from reaching the answer to the repeating question. Like the voice urging him to get off this train of thought was just as concerned with maintaining the fantasy because it was postponing reaching the answer. But they already reached the conclusion in the car that time can be like a train you can’t jump off of without dying.

That’s my interpretation of the ice cream girl at least. She is subconscious bubbling up as a defensive mechanism, but that defense mechanism is soft spoken and too late.",imqf5b

g4wnv50,"It was no coincidence that Jake recalls, but misinterprets, Tolstoy's wisdom imparted in *Anna Karenina*: 

>Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.

This parallels the concept of entropy, the amount of disorder in a system; there are very few ways in which things can go right yet so many ways that things can go wrong. We are therefore much more likely to end up in latter states than the former ones.

Notably, entropy gives rise to the arrow of time through the Second Law of Thermodynamics: entropy in closed systems inevitably increases with time.

Structured life thus disintegrates if an organism fails to actively preserve order by expending free energy or be nurtured by others. We see this with the pigs who quickly become infested with maggots after only a few days of neglect.

This makes their discussions in the car on the way to the farm even more salient. Life is defined by an active resistance to the entropic forces that attempt to perturb homeostatic conditions. Nevertheless, we cannot oppose these forces forever; we grow older, we get sick, we die. This is what she means when she says that we do not pass through time, but rather time passes through us. This is an important distinction.

If we were to cut out all the parts of the movie that aren’t happening “in real life”, we would just be seeing Jake (as his “true” self in time; an elderly janitor) going to work, and then committing suicide by letting himself freeze to death in his truck after his shift.

g5039dc,"Oh thank god, I'm not the only one that didn't feel the movie was great. I liked the acting and want to see more movies the cast are in (especially Jessie Buckley), but the rest of the plot was so confusing and then got boring halfway. The entire first half I kept yelling, ""WHAT?!"" in my head as it kept going. During the second half, I was on my phone while looking at the movie every couple of mins as I just wanted to get through the rest of it and hoped something was going to happen, but nope, it just became even more confusing. I'll probably read the book in the future, I don't know.",imqf5b
g55z13v,"Exactly, the book makes things slightly better given it has more of a creepy tone and isn't nonsensical for nonsensical value, but it's overlong ending and the twist is so poorly executed.

I liked so many things about it but I honestly couldn't recommend it to anyone. I was temped to fast forward towards the end when it started to go off the rails *again*.

I think what they were aiming for was clever.

g704zoj,"I actually want to add the scene with his mother as the perfect housewife and mother, where she herself says Jake is controlling and that she blames herself because she has to bow to his every whim because she feels guilty; she mentions that he is closing people off and then tells the young woman to take charge and enter the basement. The next time we see the mother, she is old again, which could imply that the young woman has once again changed to a new relationship. The old one may have ended when that particular woman ""took charge"" and went against his will. 

At dinner the mother is meek and scared of Jake, while the father was likely exhibiting signs of early on set memory issues years and years before this dinner, leaving Jake as head of the household and exhibiting more control via fear with his mother who he is very impatient with and wants to constantly correct her. 

I think Jake had trauma, and perhaps had to care for a mentally ill mother and sick father as a young man and that this left him with existential dread which projected into abusive behavior.",imqf5b
gctuppk,"Thank you for your review, I enjoyed reading your perspective.  However, I disagree with your interpretation mostly because the book has a lot of information that the movie left out.  The book makes it clear that Jake is a lonely, isolated person also struggling with regret, old age and a traumatic upbringing, and not an abusive person who took advantage of women.  Lucy is a part of Jake's fantasy world and is an extension of Jake's personality.

I don't want to spoil the book in case you're interested in reading it, but the best evidence the book gives to support my point is that Jake never even asked for the woman's phone number at the trivia night because he was too nervous.  She did exist, but never as his girlfriend, just as a person he glanced at for one night.  Her entire personality is based on things he's read in books, seen in movies, or experienced in his own life, which is why we see ""her"" paintings in Jake's room, or a quote that she read in the car ride in one of the books in Jake's room.  It's highly unlikely that Jake went on to have relationships with other women and abuse them when he couldn't even muster the courage to ask for a number.  

A second example from the book is that Lucy has a traumatic memory of a time when she was almost removed from her parent's home when she was a child.  Keep in mind that Lucy is a representation of Jake, meaning that this happened to Jake, not Lucy.  To sympathize with her, but not with him, when they are in fact the same person, reeks of a kind of prejudice that exists against the Jakes of the world, which is one of my interpretations.  This is why Jake wants to be accepted by a woman, to avoid being scapegoated, to avoid becoming an easy target for women who are looking for someone to blame, someone to hurt, someone to dump their own pain on.  His realization that he can't have this kind of acceptance or peace of mind, even in his own fantasy, is why he wants to kill himself.  He'd rather freeze to death in his car than go another day having to deal with people like the mean girls from school who mock the way he looks and walks (which is why he's afraid of them when they appear later in the movie at the ice cream shop, despite it being part of his own fantasy).",imqf5b

g4ebb1s,"Apparently in the book Jake had a disabled younger brother that would follow him around the house. Jake would lock himself in the basement to be away from him, implying his brother scratched at the door to get to him.",imqf5b
g4igq6l,"My take was that he made the dog up on the spot to explain the scratches on the basement door and he wasn’t quick enough to do it correctly. In the second scene where the girl is petting the dog you don’t see it at all IIRC. IDK though. 

As for the girl with the rash I think she was supposed to represent Jake as one of the kids who grow up awkwardly because of their baggage. The ones he tells the young women he “see’s later in life with a dark aura (paraphrasing)”, or himself basically. The girl has the rash because he had the same rash in real life.",imqf5b
g53y6fi,"Well, wow is an all-purpose exclamation.",imqf5b
g5bjqhz,"I think he was a lonely kid that got picked on a lot and then became a janitor at a school he hated. So he sees kids at the school who are also lonely and sad and sees himself in them. In the scene it’s somewhat literal. The teen girl says how he felt as a kid (that the good looking girls are petty and mean). She feels bad for the young woman because she is, in that moment, a projection of the janitor both feeling sad for those sorts of kids and also the sadness he feels for himself. She even takes on his traits, she has the same chemical burns he has for example. 

As to why she’s warning the woman, I think it’s because he feels conflicted about what he’s about to do, which is kill himself (or let himself die if you prefer). She’s saying “you don’t have to leave your fantasies. You can stay here and avoid this” but he still feels the pull of suicide and the press forward.",imqf5b
g6s47f6,"I felt the same way. I. Love. The. Book. It was one of the most disturbing stories I have ever read- tragic and scary at the same time. Absolutely genius. Iain Reid deserves all the credit. 
This movie though, what a disappointment. Kaufman was so preoccupied with his own creativity that he failed to keep the storyline together. There were major issues that were never resolved- and details that were left out to the detriment of the movie. Every time he went off on a tangent it lasted too long— this sacrificed any kind of concern I had for the character(s).  The ending fell flat instead of delivering the guttural reaction I had hoped for. There were beautiful parts, sure, but very little cohesion in my opinion. 
It was a little bit too much of the whole “it’s art if I say it is” mentality for me.",imqf5b
g8zp7od,They are coming from within the house. The “fantasy girl” is getting calls from herself. Each time she has a different name because fantasy girl is actually a compilation of various girls Jake has met in his lifetime. She isn’t real. She is Jake’s (or rather the janitor’s) idealized version of a girl who could have changed his life. I think reading the novel helps explain the film.,imqf5b

The scratches are from the dog as he did explains, he just has  an unconnected lingering childhood fear of basements that's playing out in his female avatar. He doesn't want to get the ice cream because the blond girls who work there used to go to the school and are mean to him.

g5ewxl6,"Now this is an interesting take that I failed to notice before, but it's true. Jake's relationship with his mother mirrors the reactions of women to him, they squirm when he looks at them in the same way he squirms at his mother being supportive of him, or touching him. He's only attentive to her when she's dying (dead?) and unable to move. This could be something else that's in his psyche as he comes to terms with his death, the regret of not appreciating his mother in life, but only in death.",imqf5b

g47s0zk,"My take on the Tulsey Town thing was it’s a place he goes to, or went to, a bunch (obviously lol) but he was scared of the mean girls and never went in or ordered when they were there. He’d only ever place an order with the nice girl with the rash, which makes sense since the other girls just laugh and are super unsettling and the rash girl was pleasant and actually takes the order. Other than that the girls kinda confused me, especially when she sorta breaks the 4th wall and starts telling Lucy that she’s scared for her. It made me think that Jakes imagination was like actually alive and Lucy was realizing she’s made up or some shit so that kinda threw me off. Also people pointed out here that the varnish is likely a real life smell going into his fantasy, cause he’s a janitor. Maybe the smell from the real world throws the imagination off and that’s when the nice girl starts talking like that? Cause like Jake looks at her and she goes back to normal, so maybe he was just distracted or some shit idk.",imqf5b
g46chy5,"Excelent analysis. Listening to Kaufman it's obvious he's very interested in art and how art impacts both individuals and societies. He clearly thinks that the ""lies"" of Hollywood and mainstream media as a whole can have a negative effect. He talks a lot about how even though his movies are surreal he's using it as a tool to try and get at something more real than most movies.   


Reminds me of the discussion about abstract v. representational art at the dinner table. Kaufman seems like he's going for the woman's approach to landscapes, where it's more about what you feel when presented with the art.",imqf5b
g46f7y5,"The backdrop of the movie is a snowstorm; a barren landscape that represents the mediocrity and meaninglessness of modern life. We are thrust into that landscape, from the perspective of a woman who has similar defense-mechanisms to modern life that most of us have - escapism under the veneer of a vague longing for a life that is ""better,"" though what that ""better"" life is, it often seems impossible to describe.

Charlie Kaufman's infatuation with this ""vague longing"" - a disease specific to the human condition - is visible in his other films as well. After all, in ""Being John Malkovich,"" the script Lotte sees Malkovich reading when she ""embodies"" him for the first time is from Chekhov's ""The Cherry Orchard."" What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to long, to pine after something? And how does popular media warp our expectations of what we should want, of what we deserve? All excellent questions explored in this film, which is grounded enough to keep the audience engaged, but vague enough to make it timeless.",imqf5b

g4gruuv,"I read somewhere that Kaufman expressed giving her character “agency.” In a sense she’s supposed to be both real and unreal.

All of his stories annihilate the fourth wall and serve as a meta commentary about his own psyche and the process of writing.

So, if we collapse the story beyond a conventional narrative to meta commentary, Jake is just as unreal as Lucy. Ultimately, they’re both characters manifesting aspects of Kaufman, and it’s well within his style to invite us to see them as such.

I get the sense that Kaufman dabbles or rather swims in idealism. Like, he sees his characters as real on some level beyond what you have to as a writer.

At the very least, she’s supposed to be something other than just a figment of Jake’s imagination. Kaufman also expressed that he didn’t want to give the film a twist ending, which is what it would be if there were a straightforward answer.",imqf5b

In his distorted past, he could have been like Jake if he had just asked for the girl’s phone number.",imqf5b
g7ss7vq,"I think this is the most sense anyone on this thread has made out of the movie. 

Personally, I thought it dragged and relied way to heavily on poetry, but I think Kaufman wanted to put a poem on film. So much of it was difficult to understand, but so much of it was beautiful.

The idea that this dream girl would be a incomplete character with no set features also really interested me and made me think about how I think. As for ending up like him, I have high hopes that you’ll far succeed him. Kaufman likes to present these flawed characters that end up being relatable because of how human their thoughts and wants are. The janitor has many thoughts that resonate to different people (The one that got me was “sometimes it feels like nobody notices the good things you do”), but there’s stuff to suggest that he’s had issues all throughout life that added up to his faith. My takeaway from the film is to not just keep letting time pass by, it’s time to make some stops.",imqf5b

Not sure about the wet dog but it could just be what he remembers most about his old childhood dog.

This is another instance of being inside ones own head I really connected with as sometimes thoughts in my head get looped or stuck and then I can’t stop thinking of them that way.

At a few points the themes of homosexuality, intimacy and shame are brought up so I think it's clear his own sexuality makes him angry at himself.",imqf5b

g5h2zrk,">I looked forward to watching this film, but it failed to live up to its trailer. The car trip to Jake's parents and the scenes at the farm are perfectly tense and creepy. The dialogue is just strang enough to keep you on the edge of your seat; always trying to figure out what's going on and where the film is trying to take you. Everything after this feels drawn out and self-indulgent.


Yeah this hits it right on the head. I was honestly invested in the first half. It was just the right amount of tense and creepy. I was as you said legit on the edge of my seat just trying to figure out where it was going. The way the dad cracks his neck when they first walk down the stairs coupled with how long it took them to come down had me thinking some sort of ""skin suit"" scenario. Somewhere between the 12th monologue and the 3rd hour of watching them through a snowy car window I lost interest. 

>Young Woman is the protagonist of the film, so if the reveal and the ending are going to be meaningful in any way, they have to be meaningful to her.  most of the tension of the film comes from Young Woman being too afraid to end things with Jake and feeling physically trapped by him

Yeah honestly I was even starting to get invested again when they were at the school and she was just desperately trying to get him to take her home. If somehow the movie could have resolved from there before it went completely crazy with some crazy ending actually *involving* her and maybe she actually manages to get home I could have forgiven so much else. Instead the only character I actually enjoyed in the film dropped like a brick.

I believe the bulk of the movie takes place inside his fantasy while he is sitting in his truck during a blizzard. Those phone calls Lucy keeps getting might be his subconscious trying to ""wake"" him up, but he keeps getting lost further and further into self-delusion.

While he's sitting there, thinking about ending things, life makes the cruel decision and does it for him. His truck is accidentally snowed under and he gets trapped inside. At the end of the credits, there is a faint sound like the car is trying to start, but the engine won't turn over. I think at the end he made his decision to live (perhaps best exemplified by the ice cream stand girl who pleads with him to ""stay""), but ironically, by that point, it's already too late.

And also, for three times the waiting for something or to get somewhere started to be awkward and annoying: while going to Jake’s house, while waiting for the parents to come down, while looking for the high school (I think it happened also with the ice cream store). All these times he interrupted her while she was talking (not sure if she was talking about things he didn’t wanna hear: marriage was one of these), making the event they were waiting for happening.

\--------------------------

I mostly agree with u/itsbeenaminuteyo's comment (above/below mine) and have some other thoughts. I finished watching it less than 10 minutes ago so I'm still processing some bits but I'd say, it's a movie about a guy's final day, dealing with the sadness he carries as he ultimately takes his own life by deliberately succumbing to hypothermia. We're watching his thought process that begins mostly as fantasies of a cool girlfriend and great career, which are interrupted and overtaken by anger and memories of being raised by his parents. Mental health is probably the biggest theme here.

It's a Friday, as the school closes down for the weekend. The thoughts are happening congruently because as he sees things around him at the school, they inform his thought process. (The pair rehearsing the dance was real, it's after school. Later at night, he has his fantasy) I believe at some point, in present time, he has gotten into his truck and decided not to start it, and his thoughts become weirder and weirder as he begins to experience hypothermia. My thinking is this begins around the time they park the car and he leaves, while she sits there talking aloud. It's him in his truck, and when she starts toget cold, he's starting to get cold, and he begins to go.

Discussions he and the ""young woman"" have are often him trying to work through his thoughts on life with his parents at various stages, dealing with their mental health. I think sometimes he's using it as a coping mechanism when thinking about his own mental health, like when he admits it's nice when you can pin the blame on someone. He obviously blames his parents.

All those moments where he interrupts her while she's speaking or thinking are him shaking off that looming thing, which some people might interpret as depression. When she glances over and see his aged hand on the steering wheel, it's actually a present day shot of him looking at his own hand.=""actually brilliant"")",imqf5b
g5csg5s,I believe it’s about a janitor who kills himself after a lifetime of sadness and disappointment. He never had any real relationships besides with his parents who he maybe didn’t even like and now they’re dead and he has no one. So he fantasizes about having a life with other people. The fantasies also make him sad and he finally decides to commit suicide.,imqf5b
g5g44ps,"Just saw this as well, left me confused. 

After reading around online, I think Jake is the janitor. The girl (Lucy) wasn't real. Lucy meeting Jake's parents was all in his mind. He was supposedly imagining what it would be like to have a partner during his life, such as being with him as his parents age, etc. 

In reality, Jake never asked for the girl's number at trivia night. He never met anyone else and got to be what he wanted to be, a poet, a physicist, a genius. He ended up just becoming a lonely janitor and imagined a great new life for him. 

I could be very wrong, and hopefully someone can correct me. I haven't read the novel, but as I mentioned, I started looking online for clues and supposedly the novel makes the ""Lucy wasn't real"" twist clearer.",imqf5b

The girl name changes because she's imagined, everything around her changes, her clothes, her name, how they met, she's a character in his fantasy, he doesn't even really know when she met him because when you make up a fantasy in your mind it's one of those details you don't really settle because it doesn't matter",imqf5b

g89ymv7,"I just finished watching the movie, but I had a thought about this. Looking at the wikipedia pages for the movie and the book, it seems like the book copped some criticism for portraying the main character as kind of ditzy and unintelligent--as someone who Jake could feel superior to. In the movie, though, the main character is written as someone with a lot of interesting and intelligent things to say, even if all those things are stolen from other sources (like her paintings and her poetry). This makes me think that the movie made an interesting creative decision here. Although the main character also seems to be a fantasy, she is *too real* for the rest of the fantasy she finds herself in. Her constant thoughts about breaking up with Jake are a kind of fault line in the fantasy. Even in a totally imagined world, real people have their own wants and desires (another reading: her feelings towards him reflect how he feels about himself). No matter how many times he resets the conversation, ""ta-das"" her, gives her a new name, artistic hobby, or profession, he can't even imagine someone that would want to be in a relationship with him.",imqf5b

I know that this is judging a movie based on what you think it should be rather than on its own terms, but I can't help myself. In the first stretch I was so interested to figure out her character and the relationship between her and Jake, so when it became increasingly clear that the movie was going in a different direction I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed, even if the direction it went in had some wonderfully inventive things.",imqf5b

g4fzhf5,"At the core, the movie is about the janitor, a seemingly normal, even forgotten guy, that dreamed of being a creative but was held back by his parents. So while the main story was in his head, it doesn't mean it was ""fake"". Also, it's an abstract movie, told very not subtly in the first dinner scene, so expect things to not make sense. It's more about the feelings you takeaway from it. 

The ballet dancing murder was him ""recasting"" his characters to be more conventionally attractive, as per the couples conversation in the car regarding audiences relating more too attractive people, despite that being detached from the norm and the 2 leads being attractive in their own right. I think the murder symbolized how the janitor has control over the characters.

The aging parents shows a glimpse into the really janitor's life, who self-inserts himself into his story with the name Jake. So you learn that perhaps his mother affected his upbringing in such a way that he was a good student but ultimately didn't meet his fullest potential (being awarded for being the most diligent student as a child and such), even feeling so guilty that he had to take care of her as she was aging and bedridden. The manner that it happened was odd, but one of the woman's occupations was studying quantum physics, where different points can be superpositioned and entangled with each other. The only things that relevant from that is that the age of the parents could change at any given time during the same visit to show a complete story. Remember, it's abstract art.

I'm not entirely sure what to make of the speech at the end. Apparently they're allusions to It's a Wonderful Life and Oklahoma, which I haven't seen. One thing to note is that as the parents were aging, the makeup department did a bang-up job, while the makeup in that scene was very amateur, almost like a high school production. Like the high school productions the janitor would watch often, especially near the end of his life. I think it's supposed to be his life flashing before his eyes, in a weird and distorted lens.

I don't know about the ice cream, I think it's supposed to throw you off. The purpose is move the story from the car ride to the high school, where Jake just NEEDS to throw it away into a trash can. There's no real reason to get ice cream in a snowstorm, but you discover some parts of Jake's life there. The trash can full of ice cream makes me think it's a useless tool to advance the story, but maybe I'm reading it wrong.",imqf5b

g5c23dd,"I think he's writing about ending things. We think its about ending a relationship but he's really writing about ending his life. This movie is his fantasy of IF he asked a girl out and what life would be like. The reason everything is so poetic, and a musical by the end is because he loves both of those things and its his fantasies.",imqf5b
g5iv3fv,"watch it again, you must've missed a lot of contextual clues on the front end. Biggest one happens less than 5 minutes in, when the young lady thinks ""I'm thinking of ending things. What's the point in carrying on like this? I know what it is, where it's going. Jake is a nice guy, but it's not going anywhere. I've known this for a while now. Maybe it's human nature to keep going in the face of this knowledge. The alternative requires too much energy, decisiveness.""   


Another early indicator is when Jake references a poem- ""Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood"" (hint hint)  

They are driving to the farm and discussing cinema and poetry. Around this time in the film, we see the janitor look out his window at a dilapidated swingset before getting in his truck to go to work. Within minutes, the same swingset is seen by the Young Woman through the car window, but it is in pristine condition and placed next to an abandoned house. She comments on how strange a sight it was.  Jake missed it. While we hear her inner monologue about ""feeling invisible"" and how Jake ""feels the same way, that he feels invisible."" we are not seeing them together as she is describing, but rather the janitor going through his mundane routines, thankless & unnoticed by any of the students in the school (except a girl who makes fun of his walk as he passes by) feeling invisible. Her voice, his life. 

  
Next we hear a song from ""Oklahoma!"" the musical that Jake knows best. Jake soon talks about seeing local kids who used to be in past productions and how they're ""older now.""   Again, we don't see this, but cut to the much older Janitor (just as Jake says ""older now"")  looking at the leading lady rehearsing her song in ""Oklahoma!"" and she notices him staring.  (we see that girl again, btw) It is the same song that's on the radio and there is no gap in the music between seeing the Janitor looking at her singing, and what Jake and the Young Lady hear on the radio. 

At this point they've hinted pretty strongly that the Janitor and Jake are the same person. He's wrapped in the nostalgia of the music. There are also clues that the young lady and Jake are the same person, or split personalities, or have shared thoughts, SOMETHING.

We're given a lot of insight during their drive to the farm, but one of the best hints is when Jake says ""yeah, i probably watch too many movies."" the young woman says ""we all do....fake, crappy movie ideas. They grow in your brain, replacing real ideas."" Seconds later when she imitates her head exploding, she says ""now we're both dead.""  She's an extension of Jake's personality, his imagination and collective fantasies from all the media he's consumed. She provides certain quips and charms, but can't think of the last road trip she was on because Jake can't develop that much of a backstory for his fantasy girl.    
Honestly by this point I'd figured she was in his imagination...

(Not only does her name change several times in the movie, her sweater is a different color by the time they enter the farmhouse, and again when they sit for dinner.)

  
Again, it's working off of an existing hunch but if you're looking for the details and clues, it's definitely not a ""web of confusion."" It's pretty in your face by the time the Young Lady looks RIGHT INTO THE CAMERA at the end of her poem about aging, ""the onslaught of identical days..."" and saying ""everything you see now, all of it...bone."" Of course, this isn't the poem she'd just finished writing, as we learn when the Young Lady turns to the open page of ""Rotten Perfect Mouth"" and begins to read that same poem again...  
The things that seem confusing make perfect sense, like Jake's decision to stop at Tulsey Town in a blizzard. He thinks it'll be romantic and charming, getting ice cream in a snowstorm, but he ends up wanting to leave immediately. One of the blondes behind the window is the girl he was gawking at while she sang at rehearsal, and he knows he creeps the girls out, that's why some won't serve him. The Young Lady insists on getting their frozen treats but they turn out ""too sweet."" - just as Jake's movie-like ideas of romance that have replaced the real thing. 

The last thing I'll mention is when the Young Lady discovers the lambs, frozen solid by the barn. She asks what will happen to them, and Jake replies ""They're already dead, what else can happen to them? They'll probably be burned next spring but they're frozen solid for now, so they're fine. No worries.""   
This says a lot about the ultimate fate of his character...   


I only saw it once, but I'd say it's definitely worth another view. I thought they did a great job conveying the themes of coping with aging, failing memory, the ""onslaught of identical days"" and navigating a life/relationship that is ""past its expiration date.""",imqf5b

g4u1jnz,"re: the movie trying to seem smarter than it is – I get what you're saying and it's something that annoys me in other movies, but I actually felt that was done purposefully here. 

Intellectual insecurity is clearly a big part of Jake's character: the girlfriend in the fantasy always has some sort of brainy or artistic career, she always comments on how she likes him because he's ""smart"" and ""educated,"" he fantasizes about winning a Nobel prize. But he didn't win a pin for acumen, he won it for diligence. Many of the ""intellectual"" conversations, like the poem or the Pauline Kael monologue, are just straight copied from stuff that he's read. 

Jake doesn't have have especially original thoughts and he knows that on some level – the Oklahoma! song at the end is a big tell. He wants to be smarter than he actually is. He craves the respect and validation that smart people get.",imqf5b

Apparently the book is more of a horror book. I do agree, I wish he would have stuck a little bit more within the language and structure of horror films while providing his own unique take. The parts that were a little more like a traditional horror film or psychological thriller were some of the best.

g47g4r2,"I AGREE. This movie is *really* bad and needlessly confusing. He didn't even try to imply what was going on. Even then, it's just littered with pointless pseudo-intellectualist dialogue. 

If they were trying to copy the manic pixie dream girl trope, they missed the mark. She ends up sounding like she just found existentialism or Nietzsche a week before. There's a way to make that work, but this is absolutely not it. The plot is also just nonsensical. 

A naked old man walking through a hallway with a maggot infested, bleeding pig? What is that supposed to be, artistic? It is disturbing and grotesque. You can make something macabre like the rapid life sequences of plants and animals in *Adaptation,* but this really doesn't work.

g44wi6l,"I feel like you hit the nail on the head. I usually love Kaufman's surreal approach to film making, but here I think it ended up overwhelming the characters at the heart of the story.   


Also, I think he might have gone too far in playing with audience expectations. I was expecting more of a psychological horror/thriller coming in and from reading what book readers are saying I think the source material had more of that. But here when the movie should be hitting the big horror movie climax/confrontation it turns into a ballet that is beautiful but emotionally confusing.   


Still, even after this i'm just as thankful as you are that he was able to produce the kind of movie he wanted to make, even if it didn't completely work for me. I love blockbuster action-fantasy movies as much as the next guy, but movies like this feel like a throwback to the 90s and earlier when a wide range of smaller films explored what movies could truly be. Really glad that Netflix took a chance with this one, hope it does well enough that Kaufman can make something else. I would honestly be disappointed if this was his last film.",imqf5b

g573vck,"The car scenes are interesting, but I'm not the best at articulating the point. I like the interpretation that the car scenes are all real Jake's attempts at trying to figure out the best start for his fantasy. Ways that he tries to dream up a demonstration of his creativity, his intelligence, and his sophistication. Except that he really isn't. The poems and creative comments are all pulled from books he read as a child. His intelligent discussions with the girlfriend are very one sided, because they're both characters in his daydream where he wants to be the hero. Like when you have an argument in the shower, obviously you're the smarter and more reasonable person compared to the strawman. And of course, all of the girlfriend's comments about ending it are Real Jake's own thoughts intruding on the daydream.",imqf5b

g66rkgc,">Always unfortunate when you finish a movie, have no idea what you just watched, feeling like you wasted your time then figure it out instantly with a quick google search and would have enjoyed it much more had you known the point throughout.

EXACTLY",imqf5b
g596ks4,"you didnt pick up on any of the clues? we picked up on some **heavy handed hints** in the first half of the film, like jake hearing his girlfriend's thoughts in the car or when they both identify as the child in the photograph. That wasn't exactly a sixth sense level bombshell, realizing they're potentially the same person.... or how about when they pull out the janitor's uniform out of the washer/dryer? 

you don't need a google search to start piecing things together. I don't see ""paying very close attention"" as too much to ask when watching a movie. I almost never enjoy anything i'm paying half attention to, so I have to imagine you were distracted or looking at your phone during the film",imqf5b
g6myz83,"Totally agreed. In the first half I thought it was going to be some thriller, it had tons of great scenes and dialogue and details and cinematography and was really creepy. I really liked it. But none of the creepy things that were introduced got resolved, and then the movie started devolving into this weird disjointed fever dream. I feel like it had a lot of potential to be a really engaging thriller and commentary, but it was too self indulgent and ended up just feeling like a mess.

Avant garde can be done well, I don't dislike that type of movie, but I think this movie did it poorly. It set up expectations, it made promises, but it didn't deliver on them. Nor did it subvert my expectations in any clever or creative way. It just disregarded the things it previously set up, in favor of pretentious dream sequences.",imqf5b
g61hyc3,"I just watched last night and I agree that the last 20 minutes were bizarre--too bizarre. There just has to be a better way to end it than that...way too pretentious. I'd say though, that the big reveal was a little bit more than ""I made it all up"". I wouldn't call it much of a reveal either since it's clear pretty early on that they're all in this janitor's head.

I would say that the movie is about a really sad and lonely man who is trying to fit this ""idealized woman"" in the timeline of his own life, which he does through his affection for entertainment (books, movies, plays, etc.).",imqf5b
g6im1p2,"I really don’t understand the hate that the ending has been getting in a lot of the comments. To me, it’s well established that Jake is a heavy musical theatre fan and we see the real older version of himself watching scenes from Oklahoma. Both tie into the main idea of the film (like the song he sings is about a lonely farmhead who’s only happy when he gets to escape from his lonely life into his fantasies). The ballet and musical number become the performances that his fantasies are.",imqf5b
g62kf7a,"I think a lot of things that you’re describing as unexplained are intentionally so because the answer is big and weird and complicated. The scratches for example can have a lot of interpretations and those can overlap and both be true. It’s also vague, I think, because it’s intentionally dreamlike and wandering. What the young woman is, for example, shifts constantly throughout the film. She’s an idealized vision of a women he wished he talked to, a nagging doubt demanding his attention and forcing him to return to reality, a driving death wish demanding he recognize that he can’t live like this anymore and has to end it, and a truth speaker who says to him the things he can’t say to himself. She’s all of those things because thoughts in a persons head are weird and overlapping and there’s not always an easy way to separate them out discretely. 

I think it’s a mistake to think of them as unexplained.",imqf5b

>""It's a very, very violent ending in the book and I didn't want to do that in the movie for a couple of reasons,"" Kaufman says. ""There's a reveal in the book that's kind of a twist ending, and I didn't want the whole thing to hinge on this reveal. So I basically planted the seeds of what the truth of the story is throughout the movie, and tried to treat the ending as if there was something more to learn and explore about this relationship.

g431rss,The fun is that there is no fun. It’s life. Kaufman’s work is heavily based in absurdism and it’s very clear here. Our narrator’s only purpose in life is to consider the what if’s. He makes it his meaning to go through the story of the girl he almost dated and reflect on that instead of his actual life. I think the Dairy Queen girl is him as well and he was abused as a child and has those scars from that. The varnishing is either the smell of the basement he may have been locked in as a kid or a way he was considering for killing himself as in she says “I’m scared for you”.

From [this interview](https://jumpcutonline.co.uk/2020/09/04/interview-im-thinking-of-ending-things-composer-jay-wadley/), he says:

>with regards to the ballet, the way that I intended that to work was for it to feel very familiar, as if you could have possibly heard this before. Maybe in a piece by Debussy or Ravel or a Stravinsky ballet – it feels like it could be from one of the those composers but it’s not.",imqf5b
g47u38n,"I didn’t read the book either but there’s mention of the pig earlier when Jake shows Lucy the barn and it’s kinda like a disgusting thing. Jake when he dies (I’m assuming he died in the car and walked out with the pig after he died cause like people who die of hypothermia strip before they die) walks out and meets the pig infested with maggots, and that’s kind of how he views himself; disgusting. After he talks to the pig the pig says, hey someone has to be a maggot infested pig, why not me? That’s kinda like Jake accepting who he was, or who he thought he was, for the first time. That’s just my interpretation though, I might be way off but I think it makes some type of sense.

Also yea, there are so many details to what’s going on, I first noticed when Jake said his mother was sick and there’s gonna be no food but at dinner there’s a feast. After that I was sure to be extra attentive.",imqf5b

g46e1ij,"Because it's clear that the story we're seeing is a jumble of past events, fantasies, and bits and pieces grabbed from fiction that the janitor is processing in his mind. We see him watch the movie with the waitress and then suddenly he's integrating plot elements into his fantasy/dream, calling the girl a waitress and changing the story of their meeting to include the Santa Fe burger. It's clear we're looking into a man who is lonely and fixated on media.",imqf5b
g464qvf,"I think that's intentional. Jake is living his life through the images that he's consumed and are in turn, consuming him.

g46g5p3,">Why was this movie rated R?

If you use the word ""fuck"" in a sexual context, like Jake's dad does several times when he's talking about fucking in the childhood bed, it's an automatic R. So I guess it's for strong language.  


In general it fits because the movie deals with some extremely adult themes. I know that's not super relevant to the MPAA rating it gets, but it's certainly not a movie that would appeal to teenagers, is it?",imqf5b

g495kxo,self loathing. He believes he would not be able to maintain a relationship.,imqf5b
g48fdei,"That’s my interpretation. An old man who’s spent his life isolated in his small farm town begins to lose his grip on reality as his sinks into dementia, an illness he watched ravage his own father. He cared for his parents as they aged and died, and having no one, is grappling with the decision to end his life before he loses all mental faculty.

He imagines the possibility of the lives he could have lived, and fixated on the memory of a woman he thought was pretty in a bar once when he was young. He spends a solid chunk of the movie imagining who this girl might have been and what it would have been like to take her home. The girl isn’t real, but rather an idealized version of the perfect woman - a poet, a painter, a physicist who grew up in the city. She’s basically his ideal self but as a woman (which some might call a heavy-handed jab at the fragile masculinity and desires of an isolated and mentally unstable man).

Every character in this movie is a reflection of himself, although the characters of his parents are amalgamations of his memories of them intertwined with his own subconsciousness.

The last thirty minutes or so - in my own opinion - are him dying and making a last reflection on his unfortunate life. Although the movie is intentionally vague as to whether or not his completes suicide.

It’s not meant to be enjoyed; it’s mean to be thought-provoking. And it is - I haven’t stopped thinking about it since I finished last night. It’s an art piece.

(I have not read the book, but am about to order it so that I can.)",imqf5b
g493vz8,Who is freezing to death inside his truck,imqf5b
g47pz7r,"I felt as if ""Jake"" could tell that the woman was going to ""end thing"" after the roadtrip ended so he wanted to extend the trip to postpone the end. He goes to the school because it's one of the centers of his emotional universe, along with his family's farm. I also think it also represents his physical reality and mental life colliding as things spiral out of control.   


 \> It's feels almost like he subconsciously brought her to the school just saw her can subconsciously speak to himself through the eyes of this unknown woman. But why?  


Good observation and question. I view it as the final moment where the fantasy of the woman shatters. She comes face to face with the janitor rather than his idealized ""Jake"" self. If I remember right she absolute shits on the janitor to his face. He can't even pretend that a woman like her could go for him. Even in his mind he's being dumped. Things are being ended.  


Here's where we come back to the importance of the school setting. We get the suggestion that the janitor really is at the school and he's clearly at the end of his rope. He's been ""thinking about ending things"" for a long time and he finally does, committing suicide at the school, the scene of his mental and physical destruction.  


At least, this is my take. It's definitely ambiguous and I'm sure there are many people with valid disagreements and alternate theories.",imqf5b

I also don’t agree with the theories that she’s a recollection of all the women Jake fantasized with. I think is very clear that they meet at trivia night and he couldn’t talk to her. But she stayed with him, she caused an impression on him.

Hence the ‘lets go for a walk first’ then delaying leaving, then ‘let’s stop for ice cream’ then ‘I can’t keep driving with this ice cream in the car’",imqf5b
g4fzras,"Another possible take.  He just had more stuff he wanted to say and do in his fantasy before introducing his parents into it.

g4potnr,To me it seems that it is a metaphor for them taking their time to come show interest in what is important in his life. Like they know he is there but take their sweet time to come greet him because there is no sense of urgency to acknowledge him.

Also, she mentions that she didn't think there was a dog (since the home looked pretty neat), so maybe he was fabricated by Jake for the purpose of keeping the fantasy alive and, therefore, was not a real dog.

Personally, I do think it can be a little self-indulgent. I just find that looking for a plot from it (the girl was real, jake was having a mental break, etc.) might be a wild goose chase. The main concrete break-off points from there might just really be 1) The janitor was Jake, and 2) the film is about Jake, and made as an inquiry into what his thoughts are (which is not necessarily that he is hallucinating diff people, just looking at how individual people process emotion and relationships w other people).",imqf5b

\>  Everything in the movie is old-timey except the iPhone.   


This could be because it's the janitor diving back into his mind. He could be projecting 20-40 years back into the past. Also, sometimes when you go out to rural areas it is like that, especially with homes of older folks who are set in their ways. 

  
\> Who was the man in the voicemails?

The man is the janitor. You can see him in the opening sequence, watching through the window and muttering the same sort of thing he says over the voicemail.   


\> Why was she getting calls from herself?    


I took it as a hint about the nature of their reality, where she gets a call from herself and it's the janitor. This is an area where it's pretty much up to interpretation. My guess is that it represents the way that his subconcious is crumbling and bleeding together.",imqf5b

The twist *was* revealed in the basement. The young woman pulled the custodian's uniform out of the washer.

Edit: It was revealed for a 2nd time when she looked through the collection of paintings in the basement - she had previously shown the parents pictures of the them, claiming they were her own, but the physical paintings were all signed Jake. It was also hinted at earlier in the movie, when she asked Jake about the photo of the boy on the wall - Jake said it was him, and she said ""I thought it was me.""",imqf5b
g5xdf3f,"I don't know that I could possibly see this movie as lazy. Kaufman will often ditch clarity and congruence in favour of expressing an experience or feeling more vividly. This makes it hard to read his intent and to describe the events in his films and their logical connections. 

I don't believe this is a weakness; I absolutely love how deep down the rabbit hole he goes. I don't watch his films for a tight narrative and a message I can sum up in a paragraph. I watch his films because they fuck me up, and because every time I watch them they facilitate intense and invaluable introspection.

It sounds like you wanted a different movie than what you got, and I can understand that. Just know that at least one person out here prefers it to the more grounded one that you outline in your comment.",imqf5b
g654klx,"Though I definitely understand what you're saying, I have to say I disagree with lumping this film in with The Lighthouse and Midsommar (I haven't seen Mother!, for the record). The Lighthouse was pretty clearly centered around themes of alcoholism- and isolation-induced psychosis. I felt that they captured that feeling extremely well, and although there were some very strange parts to it, I didn't feel like any of it was too ""out there"" or just added in for the sake of being weird. 

Midsommar, on the other hand, I don't feel belongs into this category at all. It was a very clear-cut story with incredibly strange and horrifying events/characters, but it pretty clearly billed itself as psychological horror, which it was. The storytelling was linear and didn't really have any of the jarring cuts without explanation that I'm Thinking of Ending Things (or The Lighthouse) had. 

Anyway that's just my opinion. I didn't love I'm Thinking of Ending Things, and I don't think it was an especially well-done ""fever dream"" type of movie, although I definitely can enjoy that sort of storytelling. It was definitely overly obtuse and self-indulgent at times.",imqf5b
g5lmb6t,"Midsommre ... isn’t especially allegorical?  Like it’s got a lot of symbolism but it’s a story with a beginning middle and end. There’s no playing with timelines or an impression that characters don’t exist or even just idea as plot. What you’ve identified aren’t allegories. They’re themes.

g5hjmg7,"edit: I forgot about the engine at the very ending. After the credits, before it fades to black, you hear an engine of a car starting. Did he survive, and is in his truck trying to start it? ...

To me, it's a guy who's reached the end of his rope, and is trying to cope with severe depression. The janitor is Jake in the present day and it keeps switching to his thoughts of a fake girlfriend and fake life where he's successful and well-off, which are interrupted by thoughts of his parents and life with them and life as an unliked reject. (Notice that he doesn't show off his girlfriend at the ice cream shop. He cowers out of fear)

He decides it's time to end things by succumbing to hypothermia on purpose. The weird trippy visuals are the result of hypothermia setting in, which begins when the woman is alone in the car and starts to really feel the cold.

also I think a lot of what they say in conversations is verbatim because it's part of him trying to use what he remembers to prop himself up and feel better, because he's smart and informed.

That's just my take — I don't think it's up to interpretation, I think it's fairly clear-cut. That's not an insult to anyone who ""doesn't get it"" - I Just don't think it's ambiguous.

also .. damn there i go again with the paragraphs lol",imqf5b
g62pk1a,"I just finished watching it and I think there's definitely a pretty clear and singular narrative as far as Jake being the Janitor and us getting glimpses of his real and imagined life.  I want to go back and watch it again later so I can spot more subtle clues along the way, but I think at it's core it's about this man who has seemingly wasted his life and is thinking about ending his life - whether he's successful is up for debate given the end credits.  I think part of the reason (although definitely not the sole reason) he's thinking of ending his life is because he sees how society treats the elderly and while he cared for his parents until their deaths, he knows he will be ""warehoused"" because he doesn't have anyone, so he'd rather kill himself than meet that fate.  He also seems like a pretty flawed individual - there are hints of misogyny, narcissism, and perversion - although there are some hints of shame and regret as well as glimmers of hope for growth and possible redemption.  He's also clearly depressed and lacks self-confidence, which is in stark contrast to how he envisions himself in his memories and fantasies.

There's a ton of references to films, musicals, and literature and while I wasn't familiar with all of them, I thought they were still used effectively.

There's clues throughout that Jake's girlfriend isn't real or at least that she's someone he saw in real life, but never got the courage to ask out and get to know (or perhaps just someone he spotted who was clearly not interested, but he continued to make them feel uncomfortable by eyeing them all night or just an amalgamation of different women he's seen or imagined over the years).  That's why things keep changing...her name, what she does for a living, what she studies, how they met, etc.  Add to that the fact that nothing is her own - the poem she recites is from a book in Jake's room; the paintings she proudly displayed on her phone were in Jake's basement studio, modeled after another artist; her criticism of the movie clearly lifted from a film critic's review. He even briefly substitutes the waitress from the movie he was watching into his fantasy of this woman he's dating.  At one point the girlfriend says something along the lines of feeling as though people are stationary and time moves through them, that she was the one moving through Jake's parents' lives.  That's because as he is reliving these memories and imagining his life with this woman, he's searching out places where she could have been introduced or what it would've been like if she had been there in those moments.  His mom references the fact that Jake is controlling, which is interesting because you can clearly see that he's given this woman independent thought and some degree of autonomy in his fantasy, but it only goes so far, such as when he interrupts her inner monologues or insists on doing certain things despite her obvious opposition.

Anyway, those are just some of my first impressions like a half-hour after finishing the movie.  I'm sorry you didn't enjoy it as much as I did or walk away with the same appreciation of it.  I really want to read the book now because from what I've read it's similar as far as the overall theme and story, but with some substantial changes made.",imqf5b

My biggest takeaways from the book and movie are: that you shouldn’t close up to the world and people, don’t wait for something to happen on its own, act to not feel regret and wonder what would happen if you did it. Or you’ll end up spending the life like Jake, alone, sad and full of regrets. It’s a cautionary tale.",imqf5b

The janitor imagines the young woman as a part of himself, his ideal partner which he repeatedly corrects and edits inside his own imagination. However, as the girl eventually becomes lost inside the house, it represents his imagination of his family and childhood home falling apart, his reality of being a janitor seeping through when she sees the janitor's clothes, and when the numerous artwork is revealed to be other artists'.

Maybe the rash wasnt rash, but wounds.. the Janitor probably works with varnish, the scratches on the door of the right side of the basement, the girl saying is not really varnish, the deppresing life of the Janitor, the girls mocking of him, the bag of the ice cream shop on the seat of his truck, he wanted to commit suicide, i think is pretty obvious what they meant.",imqf5b

His mum plays up his talents and intelligence when really his attempts at poetry and painting fail, and his greatest achievement his mum keeps repeating is being good at the 'genius' trivial pursuit - which would just require him to memorise all the answers anyway - and that he is diligent. He wanted to be a painter, he wanted to be a poet, he wanted to be a physicist or viral researcher but didn't. He was too up his own ass and blamed it on trauma throughout his childhood - which he argues with himself about with Lucy whether or not there is a time when an adult should take responsibility.

I've been binging Kaufman's films this past week before watching *I'm Thinking of Ending Things* last night, with the exception of Synecdoche, New York since I watched that last year, so can you jog my memory on how it's close to this and *Anomalisa*? I remember coming out of it not really understanding it.",imqf5b
g47tnty,"Im guessing the dog is an incredibly old memory (his ashes are in his childhood bedroom) so it either only shakes all the time because that’s the only memory he really has of Jimmy or just cause Jake can’t remember the dogs face and the shaking makes it hard to see. It kinda eludes to the whole we’re in Jake’s head and presents more inconsistencies. As Lucy points out, it’s very easy to tell if a dog is at the house (toys, beds, etc.) so it quickly shows that things are off at the house, and that’s also the location at the film where things are the most cluttered memory wise.",imqf5b

The movie also plays with that possibility when the fake janitor is killing fake jake, he is supposed to be an crazy serial killer or something, or thats what the spectator should conclude over the course of the movie.. he watching them from his appartment raving, at the end of the movie spying on them again.. is like a very obvious serial killer movie, but the characters in this movie are like awake from the paradigm.. scares me a little bit, was only hearing this on the dawn and i felt like the characters were talking to me, lol.. i mean in a lot of scenes the fourth wall is breaken.

Maybe she is like the part of him that doesnt want to kill her, she is constantly flattering her, like giving himself reasons to not kill her, saying she is different from the other girls.",imqf5b
g47umc7,"My thinking on it was pretty simple compared to a lot of stuff I’ve read. Jake mentions that he checks who’s working before ordering and gets super uncomfortable when the two ‘mean’ girls pop up. Lucy tries to order but they don’t really acknowledge it, they just act creepy and unsettling. The rash girl then takes the order and makes the ice cream. To me it’s obviously a place the real life Jake goes to a lot but never ordered anything unless the rash girl took it, which is why she popped up in the memory. She was one of two characters that wasn’t unsettling in Jake’s mind (the other being Lucy) so I think she made him feel comfortable whenever he ordered. As far as the wound and the “you can stay here you know line” I have theories but they’re kinda cluttered.",imqf5b

g49smxc,"When I first read in the book about scratches, I thought there was a monster hiding in their basement. In the movie, it looks like a big monster made those scratches too. Maybe the basement is a symbol for Jake’s most raw and real self. Inside, he thinks of himself as a monster- a loner, someone unworthy of love. Therefore, he persists that the girl must not enter the basement. Yet, as the house scene proceeds, she enters the basement. This can be justified through Jake’s spiraling mental health that is later explained at the end of the film.",imqf5b
g49s70r,"The inner monologue we hear from the girl is really an extension of Jake’s thoughts. 
In the beginning we believe she wants to break up with him when she says, “ I’m thinking of ending things” and repeats this statement over and over again. However, in the novel this statement actually reflects Jake’s “one question that needs to be answered (mysterious phone caller)” which is if he should kill himself. The-head-on-the-dads-shoulder is not explained, but my theory is that a part of Jake wants comfort from his father. When he first see the father, he shakes Jake’s hand and clearly ignores him. Later at the table the dad makes snide comments about Jake’s lack of athleticism, very much different from him. This proves that the dad and jake were distant; therefore, one can assume the girl awkwardly puts her head on his shoulder as Jake needed parental comfort growing up.",imqf5b

He’s reluctant to drive her home because when they get back he knows the relationship is over or he’s seeing it for what it is, a somewhat pathetic fantasy (this is when she starts being more overtly argumentative with him and starts talking about feeling exploited).

The comment about the smell of varnish I think is because Jake grew up on a farm, he likely often smelled badly, and claiming it was from varnish is an easy excuse. (EDIT: this also explains his irrational angry but apolagetic response to lucy saying the dog smelled, further showing his view on smell and the torment he went through as a child because of smell). I think he sees himself in the girl with the rashes, she isn't confident and has some noticeable difference on her body, similar to Jake's poor smell. I think her talking to lucy saying she doesn't have to go forward is another personification of Jake's self doubt; even in his own fantasy, Jake's idealized girl wants nothing more than to escape.",imqf5b

g433dzp,"- The baby food is confusing but it might be Jake’s memory from being a child or from when his mother died. 
- I am pretty sure Yvonne is meant to be the woman from the film the janitor watches. 
- The janitor is 100% old Jake, just different actor. She is just a figment of his mind so he can make her feel anything. I think it was more a reflection of his comfort in her presence if that makes sense? 
- Again, it’s his memories he’s putting into this story of a girl he almost dated. All in his head so he can put anything he wants in it.
- I think he’s the one that actually has tinnitus. So he reflects that onto his mother. 
- I don’t know if he froze to death or not. The pig felt like another metaphor for himself. 
- I think the janitor represents killing the part of Jake that thought it was possible to have a normal healthy relationship. Basically like the janitor part of him wouldn’t allow Jake to be happy with a women. Or like the idea of him being happy and married is murdered by the reality of his occupation and current life.
- Oooo I didn’t think it could be of the school being cleaned good catch! I thought maybe it could be a way Jake was thinking of killing himself, (gasoline and fire?) That’s why she says “I’m scared for you”

I had similar issues with the film ""mother!"" which only really works on the metaphorical level, but not on the primary level. I liked this a lot more, as the dialogue was better. Both are incredibly claustrophobic though. 

Think about it like this: The janitor is getting ready for work. He's lived a long and lonely life - probably never had a girlfriend, not gifted in any particular way (though he works hard to be intelligent and gifted by practicing his artwork and reading lots of nonfiction books, as well as reading about physics). 

As he's getting ready, he sees a pretty girl waiting for a ride. He imagines her as his girlfriend when he was much younger, waiting for a ride from him. They are going to meet his parents. This is a fantasy he's run through thousands of times in his life - taking a girlfriend to meet his parents. He knows that this won't work, though. He's lost a chance at a deeper connection or feeling of achievement (he's afraid of all women to the point where he can barely make eye contact, and he's never going to get a medal or anything in recognition of his non-achievements). His mind wanders as he goes about his work, so things are constantly seeping into his fantasy (the kids performing Oklahoma, the swing set, the cleaning fluid, the girl from the movie and her job as a waitress which work their way in, the thermoses in the entry, and the clothes in the washer). He's thinking of ending things. He is tired and can't even remember how long things have been this way. He's caught in an endless loop. The fantasy is a distraction, but he also knows it has to end at some point. He imagines dialogue with the girl as we imagine or predict our own interactions. All of the dialogue and subject matter is within our comfort zone. The books, movies, and poetry they discuss is strewn about his room. He grew up with it. Most of these things are 20+ years old. Her name changes throughout, but she (he) doesn't want to acknowledge what she (he) already knows. This is just a distraction until he can kill himself. In the end, the fantasy cycles through the only places he knows (the street with his home, his childhood home, the Dairy Queen he goes to all the time, and the school) and it has to come to an end. The truth is, he never had any courage to ask a cute girl for her phone number, and he thinks she was creeped out that he kept looking at her (we don't know that this is true, it's just what he thinks). The ideal version of himself that could have had this life was ""killed"" by his failure to develop into anything else. He's a janitor that still feels a considerable sense of loneliness. He can't fill that hole with anything. He dies, and imagines himself accepting an award and singing to the crowd the song from Oklahoma, a song sang by the guy who doesn't get the girl or win the day. The ""bad guy"" song. He's the pigs that never moved and so the maggots slowly ate away at him until there was nothing left. 

I think the film was beautiful and good overall, but it really needed to tie the concepts together at the end. Jessie Buckley's character, as a subset of the Janitor's psyche, needed a catharsis to close out the movie, and the connections needed to be made more explicit (but not too much so). 

That's my take on it. Hope this helps!",imqf5b

g4hgvwn,"Like I've said in another comment, one of my favorite movies is The Prestige and this film is the antithesis of that film. The Prestige is enjoyable to watch the first time, then there's a lot more to unpack on subsequent viewings. Great first watch, great to watch after the fact.

This film was was painful to watch the first time, then you realize there's more to the film which you mostly will not understand at full fault of the film itself, but then you also never want to rewatch it because it's so painful to watch. The fact that people only like it after reading X is a testament to how a great premise and meaning was ruined by such a dreadful execution.",imqf5b
g447gcn,"The first stance of the ""sissies"" comment was, to me, an indicative of him constantly trying to one-up the Young Woman in conversation, show that he was smarter than her (like how he tells her to ""look up"" stuff). Then when the second one happened, I feel like it was a little different. 

I don't think Jake's actually gay, but, if he was bullied in high school, there's a good chance he was targeted with homophobia (bullies aren't creative and many young men who don't fit standarts of traditional masculinity get labeled as gay in HS regardless of their actual sexuality). Which makes sense when you think about his line right after the defense of homossexuality, about how we label and isolate people in society - he's not gay, but he knows a little of how that feels like.

Also, someone brought it up in an earlier comment that the Young Woman's conversation with the dad could suggest Jake was sexually abused by him (the part about the bed in particular). If that is the case it explains why he's so defensive over the gay comments - male victims of sexual abuse feel emasculated, and often fear ""turning gay"" as a result of their assault.",imqf5b
g4wxauk,"I think I interpreted Lucy forgetting words as dinner as a sign of Jake starting to lose control over his fantasies. Instead of a nice conversation, his fear and insecurity (about himself and his parents) takes over and he forgets to keep his fantasy conversation going.

I'm not sure about their car ride to the school. It was like he was (thru her) proving to himself to be outmatched by a proper scholar (her). His analysis wasn't as sharp as hers, and he even ""lost"" when discussing ""its cold out side"" where he accualy had a point.",imqf5b

g42ic34,After this first comment I started making dinner and I just wanted to add that as I was chopping vegetables I found myself reflecting upon the movie. This is also what Jake is doing as an old man as he's doing the tedious work of cleaning a school. Anyone who's worked manual labor jobs before knows you find yourself daydreaming to pass the time. I think that's also why he wants to stay in one time for longer than he does in each scene because he knows his life ends at the school and in his decision to commit suicide. He is cherishing moments in a life he never had. It's also extra sad that even in his daydreams he can't imagine a girl liking him for very long before breaking up with him.,imqf5b

g56usi3,"I disagree megamuch. As an individual with a schizophrenic-type disorder, who grew up with negligent parents and has had suicidal ideations throughout my life, this movie almost feels like it is speaking to me. The portrayal of the will-less lucy is wildly close to my regular day-to-day experience during flare-up periods. Prone to disorganized thinking, paranoia, misinterpretation of affect, and unwarranted affect- she exudes the lived experience of her disorders. Every relationship i've been in has been for others. Lucy asking ""is this it? Am I just going to get married now? Do I even have a choice?""- that is how I've felt with every relationship because of my lack of presence. And Jake's parents, who are 'nice' but also totally distant, are how my parents have been to me. 

I agree, it is self-indulgent, the references are inconsiderately esoteric, and the logic of the movie is frumble-schrumble. That being said, what it portrays is an experience which is irregular, disorganized, hard-to-express. As for the niche philosophy and contemplations: intellectual hypertrophy is very common among schizophrenic type disorders.

To be perfectly honest, I have never known what I sound like when on disorganized rants until this movie. My past partners have told me I rant terribly fast, hard to follow, hypercomplex speeches. Jake's animal traumas feel like mine but reworded. His suicidal visions are exactly the emotional sentiment behind the moments before an attempt. The moments of heightening psychosis are all too familiar to me.

The movie isn't for everybody, because it mirrors a life experience which is astoundingly irregular, absurdly strange, and heartrendingly anticlimactic. But it's exactly those reasons why it is the perfect film-wise representation of life burdened by serious mental disorder.",imqf5b

g45pugw,"1. The three people i think they are what a romantic tragic movie suppose to be with this characters, the cliché, the topics, the ideals.. The good guy, the princess, and the bad guy, the tragic dead, the perfection in all of them compared with the original ones. They are all the Janitor, and Jake is probably young Janitor. 

She looked terrified in that hug... if you see the characters like an unity and you related the scratches in the basement.. maybe the father wasnt a very good one with Jake.. but i dont know, that scratches can be from the girls from the ice cream shop too, the frontal ones are probably from the dog trying to open the door, but the ones in the right seems to be a person trying to hold it while being pushed inside; i remember too that Jake had anger issues, maybe when he was a child and had that problem he was locked over there. Also when they just arrived at the house, the greetings between Jake and his Father are so cold, i know the father represents some kind of neck issues, but he didnt even look at Jake, so there is some conflict over there. ALSO the scratches... the frontal scratches in the door didnt had patches, instead the ones in the right it did, so probably the right ones were more recent, so probably considering that this movie doesnt give a fuck about time, and considering the Janitor the center of the movie, and probably a serial killer, the scratches were caused by the girls from ice cream shop.. this movie is just like a puzzle, i love it.

2. The question in the book was: What are you waiting for?.. i guess he wanted to commit suicide and he was asking himself why dont you do it?.

3. Yes, i think the autor wanted to express a conflict between certain cultural movements, romanticism (or idealism is how i see it), modernism and postmodernism. The ideal couple was romanticism (the duo dancing), the zemeckis couple was modernism (the film inside the movie), and jake and louisa were postmodernism.

4. If you see the movie like an unity, an that unity is the Janitor, you can see why she seems so familiar. He sees her in the school, when he goes to buy some icecream, and there being Louisa, because the Janitor is all of them.",imqf5b

There's a theme of lack of respect or the jettisoning of ""the aged"".

So they factor into his journey; he is afraid of ""some"" of the girls, but he's willing to pay the brunette who didn't laugh at him in the flashback, just smiled kindly.

g4uvy2i,"The poem that Jake/the janitor has her reciting is a pretty recent one - honestly, the janitor is more tuned in to the modern poetry scene than about 95% of the population. If he's reading that sort of modern poetry, it's no stretch at all to think that he's read a few of the thinkpieces about Baby It's Cold Outside -- it's become pretty much a cliche at this point. 

Of course, that take on it wasn't topical when he was a young man in the 70s, but a big feature of the movie is how he's remembering different eras and sometimes they bleed into each other (the old car and the rabbit ears -- but the girl has a smartphone, the new swingset in front of the old house etc). And I don't think he necessarily subscribes to the ""new"" view of Baby It's Cold Outside (honestly, that take is pretty tired and played out at this point, you have to wilfully ignore the context) but he's trying to imagine a conversation with a young woman and that's how he imagines her thinking and how the conversation would go.

The varnish seemed coincidental - or it was simply a way to ground to the fact that Lucy (no name in the book) was all in his head because she kept mentioning the smell of chemicals throughout the story. 

So after the reveal that she is actually him all along, you realize that’s what that chemical smell she was smelling the whole time was.

It seemed pointless to mention the varnish it in the movie. Especially just the one time at the ice cream place. Lucy never mentioned it or the headaches it caused her in the movie - and we never got a scene with the investigators discussing his death/suicide and the potential reason/cause behind it (the varnish).",imqf5b
g457ube,"it all doesn’t quite add up to me because iirc, in the book that scene (which takes place at a Dairy Queen but I guess they couldn’t get the rights for the film), the reaction of the girls working at the DQ is the harbinger indicating to the reader that, ‘ok, something is *really* fucked up here. I don’t know what and I don’t know why, but this don’t feel right.’

Given, the book also has the moment where she sees the picture of herself at the parents house that says something’s amiss (which might be the scariest moment in the book prior to the climax), but the movie makes clear what’s going on pretty explicitly when she’s in the basement with the clothes in the washer. the more I think about it, the Tulsey Town scene seems injected to create an anxiety surge but i’m really unsure if it serves a specific purpose in telling us something about Jake’s psyche",imqf5b

g4wogrb,"This was the eeriest part to me. My first tip off that things were gonna go helter skelter was that there is actually a copy of the movie ""A Beautiful Mind"" in Jake's bedroom as she first arrives. Suddenly it hit me what was going on with the movie.

As I continue putting the pieces together, all of a sudden I realized that it was the EXACT same speech from the movie. I literally got chills down my spine.",imqf5b

g43a752,"> Overall, this is more of a very dark comedy about someone who thinks too highly of himself. His references to culture, art, science, are all so banal and sophomoric or downright illiterate that his idea that he's intelligent because he plays trivia night at the local pub and guesses some of the answers correctly is a big joke

I very much disagree with this notion, lots of references are far removed from a sophomoric nature, most people in this thread probably never read a single Pauline Kael critique or even heard of ""The Society of the Spectacle"". Illiterate? Give me a break.  
The whole trivial pursuit genius version part is clearly making him uncomfortable, it's not a person who thinks they are oh so smart, it's a sad, old person with interests in all kinds of things and these parts of them manifest themselves into the fantasy we are witnessing. It quite literally states this in the film as well with an oscar wilde quote.  
Now i won't completely deny some humorous nature and some eye rolling with some of the references, but ultimately that's all simply part of the janitor character who is someone we are supposed to relate with on his journey towards letting this fantasy go, not making fun of him.",imqf5b
g43bffj,In the book he is actually very intelligent but has a whole bunch of mental illnesses that has kept him from excelling and causes him to distance himself from people and fantasize about connections with people so it’s hard for me to see him like you said when the book basically explains the opposite. But Kaufman could have changed it.,imqf5b

LOL that was sort of my thought when they mentioned quantum physics. I knew a guy a high school that really claimed to understand it and was like, really obsessed with it. 

And then at some point a few years later, he asked me if a score of like 1100/2400 on the SATs was good. It was not.

What an odd dude. Seems like he has a girlfriend now and works at a coffee shop, so that's something.",imqf5b
g47mkj8,"That's not how I would characterize his movies at all. 

Edit:
> “Sometimes things are funny because they’re funny, and I feel like it’s possible that Zemeckis could have made this movie, even if it’s unlikely,” Kaufman said. At the same time, there’s a touch of irony to the choice. “I don’t think Zemeckis ever has or ever would make a movie like this,” Kaufman said. “It’s more like a Nancy Meyers movie. He wasn’t a model for it. His stuff is generally more high-concept, but it’s possible, so the joke resonates somehow.”

g4ag7gy,"So, this is like the darkest interpretation of it, but what I thought is he was a lonely guy his whole life and the trivia night was the closest he'd ever gotten to having any kind of romantic meeting with a woman, so that was always the meeting point for his fantasized ""girlfriend,"" but everything beyond him just looking at her from across the bar is totally fabricated. He doesn't really remember her name because he didn't really meet her, and some parts of the trivia night are even fuzzy. 

At the end, ""Lucy"" basically says as much, that she just thought he was creepily staring at her, which I think is him sort of confronting reality. Then she says bye to him like he is starting to accept that none of it is real.",imqf5b
g47r7ue,"He never actually met the girl so he doesn’t know her name. Idk about you but anytime I imagine things the names of the people change, as well as certain backstory things which was portrayed in the movie. So I think she was real, considering everyone else in his head were also real people he knew.",imqf5b
g5jb2mr,"Thanks. I thought he was dead too. The only reason I think that he lives to repeat it, is that after the first set of credits role, and before it fades to black, you hear the sound of the engine starting. It's like a teaser at the end of an action move. It also sort of fits with the title of the movie.

You make a lot of good points through about the rotting. I hadn't put that together that way. Maybe he never actually got out and it was a hallucination. I know that's common behaviour for people who actually have hypothermia.",imqf5b
g4al8bc,"No, it wasn't clear. The film was very difficult to watch. It was a real embodiment of the title. 

In fact, I felt like at one point, when the kind girl at the ice cream store tells him that he doesn't have to keeping moving forward in time, the film makers were almost goading us to stop watching. I suppose the irony is that the kind girl at the store was essentially telling him that it was OK to kill himself.",imqf5b

g661d35,"Just finished, was floored the whole way through but I felt like I got it. My quick 2c here: I felt like the whole point of the movie was the experience of “getting it” and how degenerative brain diseases dissolve that grasp on reality. 

The movie was us experiencing Alzheimer’s, trying to make sense of what were given, when the real driving factor was the emotional gut feeling that something is wrong here. Details are inconsequential if you’re living under that kind of self-disillusioned dread. 

That feeling of grasping for what still makes sense while reality unfolds to the contrary... real horror exists and people face it every day, “everything is tinted” and thus coming home is the worst if your home is that uncertainty.",imqf5b
g4y44t0,"As a fellow cinephile myself, I think it's okay to be confused by this film. It definitely required a second viewing to catch up on all of the intricacies and nuances presented in the film. To me, it's like staring at a work of art, appreciating it for its technical and visual artistry while still being confused and torn at my own feelings and emotions. This film reminded me a lot of mother! for some reason, but the themes in this were a lot more subtle than Aronofsky's work (which I hated).",imqf5b

g56ouds,"The movie was fine until they left the house. After that I really kind of wanted to throw my remote at the TV, especially with the scene where Kaufman was complaining about film critics. At least in Birdman when they did this they reached some kind of mutual understanding. He’s just pissed off that some critics were put off by Synechdoche and Anomalisa and he’s being petty. By the time the dance and the awards speech came on I was like just put it out of its misery already

Edit: I really think the problem is written *and directed* by Charlie Kaufman. The man has nobody to rein him in. It’s the George Lucas problem",imqf5b
g4mr7di,"Part of my feeling of unease I attributed to feeling like someone who's given a puzzle, but the clues are too obscure and disjointed that I don't even have a sense of how to proceed to solve the puzzle.",imqf5b
g59l8o6,"I think it must come down to Kaufman directing it in addition to writing it. He's such a good writer and also such a weird writer even with other people directing the movies, but maybe those directors were helping keep the bizarre tamped down to accessible levels in his previous projects. Like, Being John Malkovich is a fantastic and insane movie, I could totally see it being shitty if it was even a little bit crazier. Maybe Kaufman is the kinda genius who needs someone sitting next to him saying ""this is great but you can't make a movie that really only makes sense if you know that it's all the delusion of a secondary character""",imqf5b

g4ewbgv,"Sometimes the more dumbfounded I am the more I enjoy it. Sometimes it’s nice to finish a movie and have more questions than answers, it alters my reality for a bit and that’s refreshing. So uhh now I’m going to search for explanations.",imqf5b
g4vuzyk,"It can be frustrating when the credits roll and you don't really understand what happened. A few writers and directors are specifically going for that feeling. you probably have some loose, intangible feelings about it. Follow those threads, and you'll come to some understanding or other of what it was getting at. 

Paraphrasing David Lynch, a lot of his films are developed *from* those intangible feelings, painstakingly shaped into colour and movement and shape and sound and narrative as a means of relaying those feelings to the audience. He chooses not to have an explicit explanation, either finishing the film or explaining it afterwards, because he created a film to relay the *feelings*, not to describe or justify them, and wants to leave that to the audience. This would go for a lot of Kaufman's work too.",imqf5b
g43qice,"Thanks. I got that and I initially figured that he was revisiting this pivotal moment at the end of his life, turning it over in his head, wondering what went wrong, as people do. But as we see more of her without him and given what she says at the school, I realized that they must never have been together at all and it was just a big ""what if"" scenario but one where he still couldn't imagine it working out or be happy because he's so insecure and aware of his own flaws. Which is something I can completely relate to. 

Honestly I think where the movie lost me is at the second car ride, specifically at the Pauline Kael bit. That latter part includes so many monologues of them explaining things to each other and the Pauline Kael part in particular goes on for so long that I was convinced the movie was using it to say something about the story or the characters but I don't even know the movie she was reviewing so it was all totally lost on me. It felt a bit like the characters were suddenly regurgitating analysis of other works of art but I'm sure it all means something. I just don't know what.",imqf5b
g4vubbj,"I think calling it a dream or fantasy is a bit clean, makes it a bit more tangible if that makes sense, kind of like Lynch's later films, it's more a presentation of internal negotiations between certain thoughts, ideas, delusions, and reality than just a single narrative fantasy. The root is less in fantasy and more in the lies we tell ourselves. That if we did this, our lives would be different. If he asked this one girl for her number, they'd fall in love and she'd meet his parents and we'd sleep in his childhood room. And the narrative of the film is more about showing how this is a lie. That this girl was with her girlfriend for their anniversary, or her boyfriend wasn't there. That even if she wasn't, he was utterly unimportant to her. That even if they did end up in a relationship, she is a person who has her own wants and desires that may be misaligned with my own and a predictable path from this moment to a happy, fulfilled life is not real. 

A lot of Kaufman's stuff is about fighting against and ultimately coming to the realisation that you cannot control other people (especially women) or many of the events that happen in your own life, that even if you work really really hard, you will probably never attain your dreams.  

The narrative of the film is about the conflict between our ideas of how things could have gone and these common themes in Kaufman's work, and how whatever ideas or fantasies or dreams we have about what could have gone differently just unravel when exposed to the reality that people and events will behave and occur as they will, not as *you* will, and the disempowerment and helplessness that follows from realising this. 

Synecdoche does it far, far better, but this film does a lot of very cool, very interesting stuff that makes an awful lot of sense.",imqf5b
g4ap55o,I love Kaufman's work and I admired the effort of all involved and I thought it was good (not great) and more flawed than his other films.,imqf5b

g47igbt,"\*spoilers for book\* It's been awhile since I've read the book, but I thought it was implied that Jake's brother also wasn't real and part of his fantasy? Mostly because Jake said his brother was a janitor who had a lot of mental health issues, but by the end we realize Jake *is* the janitor with the mental health issues. I just figured Jake's brother was a way for Reid to introduce the reader to the idea of the janitor without outright saying it's Jake. By the end it's just implied that, like most of the characters in the book, his brother is just an extension of Jake himself. 

The scratches are something I'm still confused about, even after the book and movie. Definitely adds to the creepy factor, though.",imqf5b

What do we get to see from down there?  The reality that he's the janitor, the reality that the girlfriend's paintings are actually posters from some guy in the 60's.  Probably more truths I didn't notice.

So the door gets scotch tape, a weak and ineffective lock, from one part of his psyche and scratches trying to get in from another part.",imqf5b
g4s9qof,"Basements are pretty well established in this movie and others as being the subconscious. This one makes special sense because Jessie being the character stuck in an illusion reaches a pivotal moment, overcomes a big obstacle and contributes to her ride back home, by pressing through the conscious to get to the basement and seeing the a bit of the truth (the janitor uniforms, the fraud paintings). Dan Harmon actually wrote a bit about how the 2nd and 3rd quarters of movies are basements/ subconscious, which aligns with the timing in the movie decently well.",imqf5b

g4k2vde,"""It's interesting that this idealistic fantasy woman he imagined for himself is super smart but not as smart as him (frequently he references things she doesn't know, books she hasnt read, she didn't know certain words he used when they supposedly met etc). She's also a feminist who calls him out and makes him rethink certain ideas (the ""Baby it's cold outside"" moment), and finally even in this fantasy she is thinking of breaking up with him and he is aware of it.""  


I got the opposite feeling. Specifically the analysis of the film ""A Woman Under the Influence."" It felt like her intellect always surpassed his own, and that he was simply trying to keep up. He never feels confident in his opinions or ideas, whereas she is very assured. He struck me as being more idealistic and naive and romantic, while she was more practical, realistic, and scientific. Interesting, though, that she often describes him as being intelligent.",imqf5b
g42obfp,Right. That’s probably why she is so negative about Jake at the very end in the school. That’s when his mental state becomes the worst.,imqf5b
g4enwdr,"Yeah, I think she's kind of an internal foil to him when she does this - like he's challenging his own ideas and doubting his own desires, like she's sometimes the ""intrusive thought"" that you have that feels like it comes from someone else. I really related to this style of ""overthinking"", I felt like that scene especially was good depiction of a person arguing with themself (same with getting the ice cream). 

He's a smart guy, and he wants to be in love and for a woman to love him. But I think in a way he also feels guilty about it. Like he respects women and he kind of... overcorrects, and uses it as a way to keep emotional distance. In real life, he was unable to approach the real lady who gave the face to his fantasy lady, and I'm sure it was partly because he didn't want to bother her in the specifically ""misogynistic"" (for lack of a better term) way. 

I think the fantasy itself is making him feel a bit guilty about how he feels emotionally about his desire to be loved vs. what he knows intellectually about the personhood and experience of women.",imqf5b

At one point, his gf even questions whether the parents invited them / knew they were coming over to visit in the first place.",imqf5b
g42924v,"And that's definitely what works throughout the whole movie. Once you've figured out (or googled) the concept, the constant correction of your own fantasy, and reliving made up scenes in your head over and over until they are absolutely perfect is just so relatable

The 'universal but intimate' line really sums it up. The general idea of making a huge fantasy in your head for a missed opportunity is universal, but the specifics of Jakes situation (his parents sickness, need for validation) is the intimate part.

I was thinking he would torture his parents, especially the mother who seemed afraid of Jake, in the basement where they were locked in. The scratch marks on the door seem to show signs of struggle which got me thinking that they've tried to escape their own son and the monster they created by confining him.

Does it matter if there's some really interesting hidden meaning? Or if I thought the actors all did a terrific job? It just mostly felt like it was being weird for weirdness sake and almost every aspect of the film was irritating.

g48ans2,I agree. I feel like this movie understands that most of its audience has read the book and almost uses the film as a companion piece or a way to dive deeper into the psychology of what’s actually happening.,imqf5b

g4mkjym,"I actually was piecing together the plot as I went, going in blind. But I was never really sure if I was right. Very surprised when I looked up the movie afterwards and it all fit with my interpretation. I'm impressed the director could make such an unnerving, surreal movie and still have the plot be comprehensible to someone with no knowledge of the novel. 

I thought Lucy was Jake/imagined by Jake after she saw his childhood picture and went, ""That's me,"" plus the dad's talk about the twin beds and the way Jake would always interrupt her thoughts. Her name kept changing, and she was a strange amalgamation of Jake's interests and fantasies (physicist, geriatrics, landscape painting, poetry). It all fell into place after she mentioned her girlfriend in the mosquito speech.

Jake and the janitor were connected through their Oklahoma references and the way he would talk about seeing high school kids at the supermarket. Then the talk about time and Jake's hands going wrinkly cemented it.

Overall, I left feeling more sad than creeped out. I did have fun imagining my cousin (who hates musicals because ""they make no sense"") watching this and losing his shit at the end when they started dancing and singing.",imqf5b

g4b84jr,The latter. The ending was very clear in the book. And there was definitely no interpretive dancing or singing involved.,imqf5b
g42xgwj,"I wrote my thoughts on another post: I thought it was amazing. 

My theory: jake is a janitor who has an encounter with a young lady while at work. After she leaves, he then daydreams or fantasizes what life might had been like to be in, ""her boyfriends"" shoes and since he only knew such little information about her, he painted all information about her and him, over with details of his own life. 

Slowly, he didnt want the short moment to end, and yet he knew, this would be their one and only time together. time is limited (like a shift at work), so in his daydream he fit in a visit with his parents, what it was like when they were younger, middle aged, and older. As well as what it was like for the dog to be alive, so he could share that memory with her too. 

When she tries to share information about herself to his parents, most of the info is later revealed to be Jake's own accomplishments (or maybe some of his ex gfs): his paintings, poetry, geriatrics, and physics. Whenever she gets a phone call, jake as an old man is tell her they need to move the story along, so ask important questions that will reveal who jake really is. 

At first, jake hides who he really is: keeping her from finding his janitor outfit in thr basement. In the end jake states he chose to be young because young was better (healthier). Although he delays and attempts to revisit their time together again, he leads her to the real him at his work (he didn't know where she lived anyways, and she couldn't recall things jake couldnt come up with).  Where it is revealed, this jake is just a stranger to her and not her actual, young joyfriend. 

Before his shift ends. Jake tries to stretch out this amazing moment by adding beautiful dance, music, and an insight to his accomplishments in life (everyone came to watch). If you watch the movie again, and imagine them as 2 old people talking,  it makes sense when they reference things from the 1950s

Edit: seemed many people didnt like the movie. . I guess I like movies that make you think, like Kaufmans other movies. And movies by Coen bros.  Someone mentioned Barton fink similarities (watching from within his mind) or synecdoche New York (another similar Kaufman movie). If you're not into psychological movies like these,  I wouldn't recommend.",imqf5b
g4b9t40,"I agree. I typically love weird/cerebral films. Maybe I’m biased because I read the book but it felt like it was a poor execution in comparison. Especially the singing and dancing at the end. It just felt like it was trying too hard to be weird for the sake of being weird.

The end of the film just felt extremely watered down. I imagine the thought process went something like... “how can we make this pg13 but still vaguely imply the true horror of this old man with psychosis who commits suicide? You know, so kids can watch with their parents and not have nightmares. I got it - we’ll express it through song and dance! We can even add in some cartoons!“ 🤦‍♀️🤮",imqf5b

g4xgw64,"This is a bit more fuzzy than your concrete (and very good) point, but I'd also point out that the cultural references were a little, *dated*, in a way that really fits an old janitor who has had various side intellectual pursuits, rather than the actual brainy hip 20-somethings we apparently see on screen. The fact that the technology is a weird mishmash of different periods really fits with it being an older man's fantasy, as well as even more concretely the way his parents ages are shifting, but some of the cultural discussions felt similarly jarring in their own way.

Like, where it really stood out to me was the ""Baby It's Cold Outside"" argument. It's a kinda cliche, tired, rehash of a conversation that I feel like people barely even have any more. Like, we've been through it, no one really has anything more to add. And Jake's kinda oblivious response, plus the ""Jesus, it's from 1936"", well, it just fits with the mind of a slightly out of touch older guy, who isn't quite ""up to date"" on the cultural dialogue. (Not that you can't you have your own opinion on the agency of the woman in the song, I've seen plenty of reasonable contrarian takes there, just that the *way* that Jake is oblivious feels much more fitting for an old janitor than a cool brainy student in his 20s). 

Beyond that, I don't want to paint with too broad a brush, because Pauline Kael, David Foster Wallace, etc, are certainly all read and discussed by young people today, so there's nothing *too* off about those being their influences. But at the very least, it's clear that the cultural references in their conversation are a very natural fit for the janitor (old guy who reads pop intellectual stuff on the side), and at times they feel a *little* dated for the demographics that the lead actors would be.",imqf5b

g4cl4jy,"I haven't read the book but the summary of it (minus the violent ending) reminds me a lot of the book *Sophie's World* -- ""protagonist discovers she's a figment of someone else's imagination"" is the big twist there as well after the story has been told in a relatively straightforward albeit increasingly odd ymanner.

g572kb3,"I think it's a bit damned if you do, damned if you don't. While I was in the middle of this movie, I was thinking the same thing. I can't get invested in the main character because she clearly doesn't exist and this is all just metaphor. But now that I know the whole story, I'm pretty sure I would have felt a massive betrayal of the movie if it played the character straight the whole time then pulled that kind of ending on me. To be invested about the character and expect a resolution to the situation she's in, and instead the ending just says none of it was real and gives you a resolution to a different character you had no previous investment in? Oof. I mean, I don't think this version worked great either, but it seems specifically made to try and avoid that.

I like Synedoche a lot more, and thinking about the differences between that film and this once, while Synedoche was heavily metaphorical and didn't follow any kind of real world logic, the characters were still real within the context of the story and you follow them to a resolution. Maybe another good comparison is Mulholland Drive, which, to get into spoilers >!pulls the whole 'it was all a dream' twist, but we never abandon the characters we'd been following, they all still exist outside the dream and it still feels like we're following and getting a resolution to the journey we started the movie with.!<",imqf5b

Plenty of ideas, art, and biological organisms did not withstand the filters of time, to assume that their extinction was due to some objective and virtuous filter stopping them just seems kinda silly to me. So, who knows, maybe your shitty art would somehow go viral and inspire a wave of new dances on tiktok or whatever new platform suddenly appears in the year 2093. Does that make it a worthy thing?

g49tr1z,"> And here the fundamental premise seems to be ""What if you fantasized about someone?""

I wouldn't say this is a fair summary of the premise. More like ""what if mental illness rendered you unable to distinguish past, present, fantasy, and fear?""

Going in blind without any familiarity with the book, I had a similar experience related by a lot of the film's detractors. It was a rollercoaster of overthinking it, thinking I was overthinking it, and thinking that actually I was underthinking it, ultimately leaving me with a profound sense of doubt and confusion. People don't like that feeling because it makes them feel stupid, or tricked, but I think it's extremely appropriate for a film essentially set in the fractured perspective of an unfulfilled and lonely old man succumbing to mental illness and suicide. Just like Jake I found myself stumbling from doubt into moments of lucidity regarding what was going on, before doubting that and stumbling back into confusion and false consciousness. I'm left wondering dark questions like ""wait, did he actually roofie or rape someone at some point, or was that just morbid ruminations?"" and as far as I can tell there's no clear indication better than what Jake himself might have had on that question in a moment of lucidity. 

On a meta-level, Charlie Kaufman absolutely was breaking the basic expectation that a reasonably attentive audience member should be able to follow what the hell is actually going on. Does that make it a bad movie? Maybe. That is critical to what we'd normally say consitutes a good movie, but breaking this convention was deliberate and relevant to theme of the movie. I guess you could call it a subversive experiment, and in general I think it's great when artists get to push the boundaries of their medium. If this technique were to take and form a genre, you'd watch films like this differently, just as one reads poetry and prose with different expectations: don't worry too much about understanding or predicting how it unfolds, and instead focus on the empathetic quality of each scene (which, I'd say this film really nailed, and is the reason after some reflection I decided I'm a fan). Also just great on a technical level.",imqf5b
g4bl10g,"Just to comment on your point about having to ""get"" a movie after the first viewing. First I did enjoy this movie after the first viewing despite not feeling like I'd completely ""got"" it.

If I never saw it again I'd still be happy I'd seen it, but I won't pretend I didn't get a bit lost and bored at times.

The second time I watched it was a completely different experience, this was the riveting, all-consuming film watching experience I crave. I didn't have to read anything, I just built on what I'd picked up on the first time, catching all the references this time to them being the same person, and how everything about her is built out of things he's seen or read.

I suspected we when his parents ages changed that he was reliving something, and might be the janitor looking back.

When the girl mentioned the same burger that was in the janitor’s movie (about half way through) it was clear that this was the janitors final thoughts.",imqf5b
g5eatsq,"Glad to find this comment chain, since most people on here are mostly discussing just the movie itself. Totally agree with you, up to her talking to the janitor I thought it was a great adaption, after that it's just...bad. I'm fine with the movie not being about the twist as much as the book, but how do you not use the scene where you finally realise what ""I'm thinking of ending things"" actually refers to? That's *such* a good moment. And like others have said, he should have just left out the calls altogether.",imqf5b
g47mlt4,"I'm someone who only saw the film, and read a synopsis of the book after. And.... they are entirely different. What I got from the film was a depressed dude dealing with his mentally ill family and new schizophrenic gf, told from the perspective of the girl. She's clearly suffering from severe memory loss, similar to the father as he aged. The whole moving being a single ""road trip"" that's repeated many times; almost like a time loop. And each ""stop"" being a sort of singular place with every moment at once (from the perspective of the memory loss girl). Both the girl and guy are clearly depressed, the girl can't even remember who she is, or which parts of her are herself or her bf. The guy clearly had some anxiety issues as well, which is probably why he ended up staying with her. The high school scene at the end basically being his regret of sticking around and dealing with it, but also sort of rewarding himself for his efforts that went unapplauded, unseen, unheard. In the end he kills himself via hypothermia, and given he's the driver, the roadtrip stops there, at the ""cozy"" high school with a sort of idealized fantasy life: living comfortably with his highschool sweet heart, becoming a professor, etc. The girl being stuck in this moment as well.

Dude drew the shit hand, as he was the pig with maggots and I think he kinda realized that and was really coping hard.

---

The official explanation appears to match the book, which seems to be about a janitor fantasizing about a fake relationship? But that doesn't make much sense as there's a lot that doesn't quite add up. For example why is there multiple versions of events? Who's calling the girl? Why would the parents be weird like that if they were normal and it was the guy with problems? he was clearly the normal one of the bunch. Why would there be so many of those ice cream desserts outside of the high school? So many things in the movie indicated a sort of time loop situation going on.

If the movie was told from the perspective of the guy, it'd make more sense why it's his fantasy looking back on his life. But it's not. it's told from the perspective of the girl, who's clearly the same person throughout the film and not a fantasy character (she existed before meeting up with him for the road trip, receiving her own calls, and clearly had her photo in the home). There's also the scene where she spaced out a bit, looked back at the family and they were gone. This is a real thing that happens to schizophrenic people. A sort of ""blanking"". They even referenced schizophrenia quite heavily throughout the film: the copy of ""a beautiful mind"", the girl clearly hallucinating stuff (the swingset), the bf who's clearly dealt with this girl's shit and accidentally over-apologizes. She can't remember who she is, and clearly is losing track of time, and hallucinating about what people look like. She hallucinated smells, conversations, phone calls, etc. None of that stuff really makes sense if you go ""she's a fictional person in his mind"". Since if that was the case wouldn't it be consistent? 

I think the double meaning of the title was quite beautiful too. She was thinking of ending the relationship (maybe she did and that was the trigger for his suicide?) and he was thinking of offing himself after his exhausting life. She was probably thinking about killing herself too; both seemed severely depressed.

I just can't see how you can arrive at the conclusion that the girl wasn't real, or that the car drive wasn't real. It'd basically be saying ""the events in the movie didn't actually happen, and only the ending is real"". which seems like a cop-out tbh and would really ruin the movie.",imqf5b
g47w0ye,"It still seems like it could be about suicide, with the hypothermia comments - all in all the movie is mpre open-ended throughout, and leaves more to the audience, I feel like it works a lot better than the simple/brutal twist-ending would have simply because in movies it would feel like a bit of an over-used trope, not having a clear answer at the end really works for me, and reinforces how all the horror-elements are about Jake's own issues, not any real danger, except frlm himself.",imqf5b
g5aiw4s,"To me he didn't die out of negligence but he let himself die which, to me, is the same as killing himself",imqf5b
g430zaw,"From what I understand in the book he killed himself in a closet in the school, which might be where he was going at the end of the movie. I haven't read the book, so if I'm wrong feel free to correct. I know it is definitely suicide, and the entire story was in his head other than him seeing a girl at trivia night at a bar.",imqf5b
g42s8ft,"I’m a huge fan of horror novels, so not much scares or unsettles me when reading such books. Yet the psychological tension of the school scenes in this book creeped me out. [BOOK SPOILERS] The part where the janitor slithers down the hallway, the woman hearing the song over and over, the message written in one of the rooms, her watching the video recording...none of that can be replaced by an interpretative dance and philosophical pig.",imqf5b
g4an4ht,"Having not read the book, I ended up getting really confused by the film and not 'getting it' when the credits rolled. Having now read what book readers have said, I'm kinda pissed off because if they'd just done what the book did I wouldn't have been confused at all and would've probably loved the film instead.",imqf5b
g42cw5g,"Yes I agree! I don’t feel like the film really earned the title as much as the book. I felt like in the book you could really understand the mental breakdown of the janitor. He was sad, alone, manic, irritable, even gross I’d say. And he stabs himself in the throat with a coat hanger! That is “ending” things! In the movie he kinda just seems like a pathetic, old man. He doesn’t seem crazy, it also doesn’t seem like he really “ends” things.",imqf5b
g42wv9p,[deleted],imqf5b
g45goge,"Spoilers: I’m gonna come from the opposite perspective. The book is great up until the end and then it gets really, really bad and explains itself in a way that is way too on the nose. Kaufman handled it in a much more subtle way and I personally prefer his take on it.",imqf5b
g42ddho,"I’m admittedly a horror/thriller fan. But my favorite aspect of the book was slow wave of like “oh okay this is what’s going on” that continually washes over you during the read, before hitting the big climax. Sure it’s a small twist. But it doesn’t feel cheap to me. I do enjoy how Kaufman brings in these questions of aging and family and time that the book didnt have, but wish he would have left in the more mental side of Jake’s character. How he couldn’t stand being around people, had chronic health issues. Etc",imqf5b
g4367e6,lol the twist in the book is almost verbatim the twist that kaufman’s fictional brother who is written to be a shitty screenwriter comes up with in adaptation. so not surprising he felt the need to abstract it up,imqf5b
g42xg5i,"I really liked the book, but I did think it lacked subtlety. I like how in the movie, Kaufman trusts that the audience can (or at least should be able to) figure out what ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" means, who Jake is, and what happened to him to get him to this point. In the book it's directly told to the audience that Jake is this lonely guy with a lot of failed dreams and that he's made this fake girlfriend, but the movie reveals those things a little more quietly, which I liked.",imqf5b
g43acxt,"I didn't love love the book, but it was a pretty good little read. I would definitely rank it higher then a cheap thiller (I'm looking at you Girl on the Train and all the other dumb thillers). Just because it's not pulitzer award winning literature and has a horror ending doesn't make it cheap. I personally would have loved to have seen him go the horror route, that interpretative dance sequence was ridiculous. But then again I'm a huge horror fan so I'm biased.",imqf5b
g4gtsbn,"You're crazy, the book was incredible! The slow reveal was so well done while still being direct. The movie was great but once they got to the school Kaufman butchered it.",imqf5b
g43boz8,that was my favorite scene personally. thought it was wonderful and i love the meaning of the dance and marriage being what we wishes his love life were and the battle being that part of himself that kills the chance of that relationship. the part of Jake that is the Janitor,imqf5b

In the end I saw the parents as Jake's caricature of themselves with their flaws becoming magnified. Occasionally he would wrest control back but they definitely had more power over the fantasy's direction at the house than Lucy did, as she was a complete fabrication.",imqf5b
g4b21mf,No orgasming chicken/mother combination,imqf5b
g6k7rgq,"I like to think that Kaufman, for a difference, doesn't underestimate the audience and trust that we can get something out of the complexity (some may say, mess) he created. 

But I get your point, it may be a more enjoyable experience if you know what to expect from Kaufman (and even so) when you should enjoy -and specially understand- a movie for itself. No body likes to feel like they needed previous research ""to get"" a movie.",imqf5b
g4dqsxp,"Midsommar is a much better movie in my opinion, although like this one I would hesitate to recommend it to almost anyone. Midsommar at least has coherency and I felt kept me interested, even with the directors cut that was 2.5 hours long.

ge8dk0x,I was way off. After the dance I thought a janitor killed her bf and she was stuck with the pain of losing him. She was depressed and wanted to rid herself of it.

Side note: between this movie and Watchmen last year, Oklahoma stocks are through the roof.",imqf5b
g42yhkn,"I don’t think she was ever real. We have no indication that the janitor ever even left his small town. In the book it talks about how Jake has a disturbed brother. His brother ended up being Jake. The man is mentally ill and probably never played bar trivia, certainly not as a young man. I don’t think bar trivia was too popular in Oklahoma in the 60s or 70s. It was a fantasy the janitor has, meeting a smart girl in a clever way to talk about artsy and intellectual stuff. It’s a sad lonely mentally ill mans ideal life. He couldn’t keep his story straight though. He couldn’t picture his mother and father in their prime. Because he saw them in so many stages of their lives. His actual experiences invaded his fantasy.",imqf5b
g44adsr,"He never actually met her at the trivia night. He couldn’t get up the courage to go talk to her. That’s why when the janitor asks her to describe him she can’t, and talks about how it’d be like describing a mosquito that bit you forty years ago. She’s just some woman he saw once and idealized in his memories/fantasies which is why she doesn’t have a concrete career or name, and why the poems and paintings she does and opinions she has are all taken from the actual work of other people, as seen in his room and the paintings in the basement.",imqf5b

g42syl3,I thought this as well... an idealized version of her maybe?,imqf5b
g444p96,"My interpretation is that the girl from Tulsey Town WAS Jake.

g4e332p,"I think you missed that, although she is a figment of his imagination, she actually has her own consciousness, too. (I think it's kind of like a dream state where she is sometimes sleep-walking and just performing Jake's thoughts and sometimes she is in control, and when she is in control, she can realize that she is just a figment of Jake's imagination.) This became much clearer to me upon a second viewing. And at the point with the photo on the wall, Jake is communicating with her as a conscious being whose consciousness exists outside of Jake, subtly acknowledging to her that she's not real. He's basically winking at her.",imqf5b

I perhaps shouldn't have watched it because I'm super recent myself lol and I had to hit pause and just go and do something else for a bit. Oh my, I know. Is that when she is saying it's just easier to say yes, and that yes turns into another yes and another? Horrible.",imqf5b
g487dhj,"Yeah, I honestly don't think the reveal even takes away from it anyway. Like, the colour line Jake says, with colour not actually existing, it's just our perception of it. The same goes for people and personalities. There is no certifiable evidence that someone is that thing. 'You can't fake a thought,' one of them says at one point. And while you can't fake a thought, you can plant it. In relationships we trade off parts of ourselves and that's why it hurts so much if there is ever a break up. I imagine to the janitor fictionalising this all it's hard to see the true 'beauty' in the ethereal sense of 'love' when you know it's all just chemicals and pathologies affecting the brain and mind. If it's not predetermined biologically, then it's conditioned sociologically. 

Yeah, I think once they changed the meeting up story at the house I realised they might be the janitor who watched the film, especially with them talking about how popular culture and films infect the brain and change our perceptions of relationships and people. The janitor has never known *love,* but has seen it on the TV, in theatre, where *love* is overdramaticised and stretched out of proportion. 

Yeah, you were definitely close! I just knew something was reated to the janitor in that they might be like a memory or something.

Really good film--plus the book is great if you're into that! I was highlighting so much of it when I was reading it.",imqf5b

g4y4em8,"The way it made a lot of sense to me is as the girl (Lucy, Lucia, Amy?) watching the unfurling of a man’s life and seeing into the insecurities that created it, the whole trajectory of his earlier and later experiences, through this moment in the present, the exact moment when she feels something is off about the relationship. She is viewing all the stages of his life and mind from an almost a stationary point as an observer watching the whole trajectory of a life compressed into a single fever dream. She sees into his early relationship, the parents future, his future, all at the same time. 

To know someone such a short time. A short romance as a glimpse into the stream of another’s life. Whether anyone can understand anyone else’s experiences. Both of them want out, she wanted to call it quits for the relationship, he seemed to have “wanted out” his entire life.",imqf5b

g9b5nhi,"I like what you said, but please note: almost all of those things could have been done just as well from the point of view of Jake. You can have Lucy screaming at Jake, or being distant, or comforting him, as representations of his inner turmoil, and still frame it as something Jake is experiencing. 

Only thing that Lucy pov enables, that is not otherwise possible, is to hear her thoughts, like that she is thinking of ending things. I didn't make that far into the movie to know if her thoughts are really super vital for the story. 

Even if we account for his mental decay, it is super weird that he is not the main character of his own fantasies. That he is not experiencing his mental fantasies from his own point of view, that they are not things that he experiences and feels. That feels very unnatural to me. Even in mental illnesses I presume your sense of self is one of the last things that still remain. *I think, therefore I am.*",imqf5b
g98tyey,"No, I don't think it does make sense. Perhaps it's not even meant to. If the idea was to show that Janitor is losing his mind and details of his story, there are better and more elegant ways to do so (that the film also used) than completely switching the POV, that don't have such heavy drawbacks, like making the first viewing so inaccessible.

For the majority of the movie, I thought the young woman had settled into a relationship she wasn't actually content with and now that she's old and dying she's thinking about why she stayed with him, or perhaps this boyfriend assaulted her and the trauma makes the memory of this trip disorienting and difficult to recall fully. I thought that's where the movie was going as Jake kept trying change their route or go back to the farm house when she said she just wanted to go home. I thought the film was essentially confirming my interpretation when the woman has a monologue in the car where she says ""It's just easier to say yes.""

I don't really know what to do with any of those clues anymore now that the film is actually just the dying fantasies of a lonely man.",imqf5b

The pig scarred him as a child because he couldn’t bear to accept that there are living beings in this world that die in a dark barn being rotted alive by maggot. The pig had no place in his fantasies where everyone is a “genus” or genius while finding ample fulfillment and love. The pig is basically walking him to purgatory and it says something like “there’s a place everything in this world, even pigs rotting with maggots.”

Of course you could also take the optimistic interpretation that everything, even things that aren’t beautiful, have a purpose.",imqf5b
g42h5sy,i like this interpretation especially bc the dog’s ashes are on the bookshelf in “Jake’s Childhood Bedroom” which means the dog died when he was a child and his memories of the dog would therefore be quite old.,imqf5b
g42mw6r,"I think this is a good interpretation/theory, even though it’s different than how I watched it at first. I love the film for how it gives you a number of “fixed points” with what we think we know about the characters at first, then scrambled them all up until it’s less clear.

I did think the movie was clearly nudging us towards getting that Jake was the janitor, but I read the end (and the whole thing, really) as a sort of mish-mash I’d the whole timeline (and possible alternate timelines) of both of their lives, with certain overarching themes. For example, she’s always studying something sort of philosophical, they’re almost always together although their happiness differs, he’s always a little strained with his parents, etc. 

Then once they got to the school, I read it as a sort of death-dream for her or possibly both of them. I think it’s open to interpretation whether the janitor (Jake?) killed Jake/himself or both of them, or whether she froze in the car, or whether he killed her and then killed himself in the snow (as the final shot sort of suggests), but either way I saw the tearful hug with the janitor as a sort of final goodbye for them and their relationship. The dance scene in particular and the “awards speech” reminded me a bit of the finale of All That Jazz in the deathbed epiphany sense.

I also think it’s suggested throughout that Jake was molested by his parents or another adult and/or perhaps did some molesting or at least peeping himself once he became the janitor in the “future.” Lots of threads hinted at but never followed through, but I think it works in the film’s favor rather than leaving things too unclear",imqf5b

g458gsr,"Kaufman himself has explained there are two layers to the joke. These layers somehow simultaneously make it an extremely simple but also profound joke.

1.  Zemeckis name was picked by an assistant from a list of directors because they thought it sounded the funniest.  There was literally nothing more to picking his name than that.  


2.  Although there was nothing more behind picking Zemeckis' name, Kaufman only kept it because it seemed plausible that Zemeckis would direct a movie like that, even though he's never really come close to directing a movie like that.  By way of contrast, Kaufman cited Scorsese as a name that would have been too implausible to make for a funny joke.

Just to two more things that might influence what you take out of the joke.

1.  Zemeckis did personally give permission for his name to be used.
2.  Zemeckis is given a ""special thanks"" in the credits for the actual movie (scroll down to the end of the credits here:  https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7939766/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast, this is really in the movie too).",imqf5b
g425ns1,"This is a spoiler zone, my friend. It literally says [SPOILERS] in the post title.

I think Netflix movies overall are pretty underwhelming. But this kind of movie I wouldn't say fits that bill. I read an interview with Kaufman where he said he liked working for Netflix because there's no box office to worry about. He said Anomalisa was so disappointing because everyone loved it but it made no money so here he was free to just make and not be worried about the return. And I think that shows, he seemed more comfortable to get weird and it didn't feel like this movie had to sell to anyone except those that wanted to watch it. And I think that's a big plus.",imqf5b
gk902dv,I'm a janitor.,imqf5b
i4sn6rg,"These are great observations. I wanted to throw out a few more because I just watched and need to talk about it!  


Throughout the film, different characters that represent alienation are referenced -- Mabel from A Woman Under the Influence is one of them (all those blowing raspberries and odd mannerisms Lucy/Lucia takes on suddenly while discussing the film are based on how Gena Rowlands played the character in the film), so is Dr. John Nash from A Beautiful Mind (Jake's speech verbatim), and so is the character of Jud the Farmhand from Oklahoma, who sings the song The Lonely Room, which is the song Jake sings at the end. 

Jake expresses a lot of compassion for Mabel's character (who is a woman with a family who is a heavy drinker who eventually has a complete mental breakdown) and seems to identify with her (the same way he clearly identifies with the kids at the high school who get picked on). Whereas Lucy just spouts off a scathing review written by Kael because she's just an amalgamation of different traits he admires, Jake has true compassion for Mabel. He sees himself in her. It leads him into a bit of a soliloquy about the futility of life, how all the platitudes about how things work out in the end are garbage, the sorts of things a suicidal person would say, a person to whom life hasn't been very kind.

In Oklahoma, Jud as a character is alienated, creepy, and menacing, and his sexual fascination with Laurie (who we see played by a student earlier in the movie and we see the janitor watching, and who later taunts the janitor btw) was one of the first depictions of what we now call sexual harassment in popular media. He's basically what we'd now call an incel, but there's a part of you whose heart hurts for him. He's really lonely and just wants love and can't figure out what he's doing wrong, and I think the parallels that Kaufman draws between him and Jake are really interesting. It's especially interesting since there's another song in Oklahoma where Jud's romantic rival for Laurie's affections, Curly the handsome Cowhand, basically goes to Jud's lonely room and tries to convince him to kill himself because everyone would speak nicely of him if he did. I swear to God, it's called Pore Jud is Daid, it's super fucked up.

I get that people found the dream ballet confusing, but it was really a callback to Oklahoma and a lot of the musicals of that time, a lot of them had those sorts of dream ballets -- Carousel, Oklahoma, Fiddler on the Roof, Brigadoon. It's just another way of contrasting the ideal (the ballet) with the reality.

Additionally, Ralph Albert Blakelock, the painter we see referenced in the film, was a guy who was super troubled and dealt with intense depression that eventually manifested as full on schizophrenia, and spent a good deal of his life locked away in asylums...which of course is when his paintings started selling like hotcakes. Again -- alienation, mental illness, isolation. He also talks about David Foster Wallace's suicide and how the suicide basically eclipsed his writing.

There are a number of clues as to what's going on even if you didn't read the book (and admittedly I watched it twice and saw a lot on the second viewing). Jake's speech in the car about the hopelessness of life is one of the first clear clues that Jake and the janitor are the same person. Jake is also the young brunette in the ice cream shop, if you notice they have the same funky skin condition when he hands her the $10 bill. The two blondes who mock the janitor in the hallway also mock Jake. He refers to having been in the high school for ""such a long time."" In the beginning of the movie, we see the janitor in the farm house, alone eating cereal and watching TV (he clearly cared for his ailing parents until they passed and never had a family of his own.)  His uniforms are being washed in the basement when Lucy takes the nightgown down (and maybe that's why Jake doesn't want her to go down there.) 

The movie is a rumination before death by suicide about how it could have been for him. Each time he ruminates, he imagines Lucy/Lucia/Amy and she's a painter or a poet or a physicist or a film critic but the one thing she isn't is real.

Just my take, but I think the thing about the rash girl is either about him running into people he vaguely knows from high school, also imagining them as young. Or kids from school now. Old or young, he still shies away from attractive women, showing his insecurity, but rash girl rationalizes why fantasy girl is ideal. But also idk why she has a rash. Maybe just to drive home that she's the unpopular, unattractive voice of reason. The phone calls and pictures actually helped me speculate that Jake was narrating as the girl and maybe had moments where he couldn't separate him from her. Varnish didn't make sense out of context, but if for the movie she had said a cleaning solution or something it would've helped make the connection of him being a janitor and real life creeping into the fantasy.

The references all im sure are related to themes in the movie but I don't think it's actually that important to know them. I felt like I was missing out by not knowing, and I'm sure itd be fun to have deeper knowledge and get those connections, but what's more important is how they're talking about the references.

I agree and the ""not moving in time"" could be Jake seeing a brief and failed relationship that happened long ago as a crucial element of his current life despite being an old man. 

>killing himself

Disagree, I feel the scene in the cold pickup truck and then walking into the cold naked (possibly due to age related failing mind) with the maggot hog was pretty clearly trying to represent how he met his end.

If you think about the movie as not at all being about ""what it looked like while happening"" and rather ""what it seemed like in someone's mind while happening"" its easier to make sense of it. And keep in mind that memories change over time and merge with other memories. And nothing really says its required that they all be Jake's memories. Having said that, don't assume we are being presented with depictions of literal ""memories"" either. Don't assume everything we see is part of a tidy puzzle, it's at best, a series of puzzle pieces that were deformed and blended together. The information is tinted unreliable but, if you take it all in, there is more than enough there to get a feeling for what happened.

Also, I do not think of this film as ""all happening in Jake's mind"". I see the girl as *actually revealed to us* and not just a series of memories. To me the story is about the intersection of these two people and the fact that we don't see what happened to the girl afterward is only because the intersection did not define the entirety of the rest of her life like it did with Jake.

She's isn't an imagined person in a real setting (like the friend in 'A Beautiful Mind'), with the exception of the early Janitor scenes the whole movie takes place in someone's reverie and she is no more unreal than Jake or the parents.",imqf5b
g4k97o2,The fun is trying to figure it out as it's going on. There are plenty of clues.,imqf5b
g4xif0b,"Depends on what you mean by ""doesn't exist""...

Like, the fact that the events of the movie require some extension beyond the literal does not require a deep reading of the movie. From the opening dialogue, it should strike you as a little odd that he appears to react to her inner monologue. Then, he calls her one name, and she gets a call *from that name*, then he calls her another name, and she gets a call *from that name*. Then, her job starts changing. The opening car ride very conclusively establishes that something is ""off"" here, and you shouldn't be assuming we are watching a literal version of events play out. By the time you get to the house, and the ages of the parents change in each scene, I'm not sure how anyone could be thinking ""Yeah, these are real characters we're watching on screen, the makeup just really sucks"". 

But as to whether or not she ""doesn't exist"", i.e., the *precise* reading that ""this is a fantasy of the janitor, reflecting a chance encounter he had with a girl many years ago as he contemplates suicide"", yes, that *exact* reading isn't super obvious as you watch. But that's intentional, not because they want to up the difficulty of viewing, but because it's *not* the only way to read the movie. 

So if you left the movie and you didn't see that precise reading, that's fine! They could have made it explicit, but they chose not to, precisely because they *want* a variety of interpretations to be viable. Of course, if you made it to the finale, and was shocked to find out that the many-named ""young woman"" wasn't a literal painter/physicist/poet/waitress living in the city, well, then yes you may have missed a few clues along the way. 

But I'm seeing some people treat this as a puzzle movie, where you either ""get"" what the answer is in the book, or you ""missed"" it. When there's a reason they don't make it explicit like in the book... they don't want that to be the only way to see things.",imqf5b

g703ohn,"I thought the flash was an actual reality of him peeping - this interruption of his fantasy is his conscience reminding him that he’s a pervert/whatever .  

The janitor is reality. Jesse Plemmons and his family and his girlfriend are all fantasy. The only reality is the janitor - which is why the girl is so blunt to him when talking in the hallways at the end. 

The peeping was reality. The reaction in the fantasy was reality interrupting fantasy",imqf5b
g6i9xld,"Nah, ""they"" were never a couple because the young woman never existed. That's why her name, job, personality, and field of expertise changes from moment to moment: Jake (the elderly janitor) keeps altering how he imagines her to fit different scenarios. 

My personal belief is that the shake shop girl with the arm rash was real, and serves as the basis for this constructed ideal woman. He mixes elements of her with movie stars he likes (the woman from the fake Zemeckis movie, who at one point takes Lucy/Lucia/Louisa's place in the car) and with his own interests to form a vague sketch of a woman he thinks might have made him happy at one point in his life.

He's so stuck in his own misery, though, that even this imaginary girlfriend is only remaining with the fantasy version of him out of cowardice. Extremely emo protagonist",imqf5b
g6gnsx5,"i mean i guess the point is to entertain interpretations, but this one doesn't seem close.",imqf5b
gelaqs5,"yea, the dog's ashes were in his childhood bedroom.",imqf5b
g5do92g,"It was obvious at a certain point that she wasn't real. The couple both share the same thoughts, opinions, and lines. The moments that she's thinking to herself (particularly in the car) and he's staring at her, he's actually listening in because it's him speaking to himself. For a moment, I thought Jake was a serial killer going over past murders in his head as we see the present as him as a janitor.

The constant changes in story made me realize that someone was making up a story. So I knew the girl wasn't real. As well, her clothes radically change throughout which I didn't initially catch. From hair up to down, to a pink sweater to a yellow one. Then there's the scene with her going down the stairs over and over again. This is  where it starts to become more clear the Janitor is ""Lucy""  playing the figment in his head that's mulling over their role in Jake's head.

We care about the janitor because the movie was nothing, but him. That's the point. The Janitor physically wasn't needed in the painting feeling things  (which the movie spells it out for you.) Outwardly, he didn't appear to be feeling things either. That's depression for you.  Although the scenes that we're watching aren't inherently sad on their own, us as the viewer, make it so. As such, the painting metaphor between his ""father"" and ""Lucy"" was not just for Jake, but a direct message to the viewer. The ""dad"" a representation of the more stubborn viewers. His dad most likely being that way in life as well.

We also didn't need a climax with Lucy when Lucy has been the janitor speaking to only himself the entire time. Lucy seemed to contradict herself the whole movie, both wanting to leave, and both wanting to help Jake with what he needs. As it turns out, she never wanted to break things off with him.

The janitor was simply using a figment of the woman to examine himself. Things he liked, things he didn't. And deciding on if he should ""stay or go."" Young Jake is how the janitor actually looks and feels inside. A part of him still wants to live which explains his constant interruption when ""Lucy"" wants to admit she wants to ""end things.""

We have more clues as well, when the ""mother"", couldn't get Jake's age right. ""Lucy"" a.k.a the janitor also goes on about a speech about ageism. As well as several references made by Jake feeling ""younger inside"" than he actually was.

The road trip is a literal drive to his suicide. The road trip and blizzard being a metaphor. The stops are the things that kept him hanging on in his life. The blizzard a representation for his isolation and his overall interaction with the world. The only things in his life that he lived for were his parents who were gone. The ice cream shop and his life at the high school. The final thread was ""Lucy."" Whom he made to fill a void in his life.

Someone with a rich life, their head wouldn't be a blizzard. It would be spring time filled with life. Filled with MANY stops. On the small road that led up to the high school was also a metaphor, Lucy's panic to go ""home"" or turn around was literally telling the janitor to just go home in real life. Jake saying he couldn't was him feeling as if he has no other choice. And him saying he'll turn around when he gets there, is him convincing himself, he'll almost go through it, but he will stop it at the last minute. 

There's a ton more of other hints. Such as the basement being the janitor's shame. These are the parts of himself that he felt shameful for. Passions he never pursued. As well as a reference to his job. Overall, I think Jake was a good man. He wasn't a pervert. He wanted to do the right thing. Such as taking care of his parents at the end of their life and being recognized for it by someone, anybody. Jake felt like he became the pigs on the farm, staying in the same spot, decaying before they were already dead.",imqf5b
g5axgoz,"The very beginning of the film the janitor is in a window above Young woman, we hear her thoughts but another voice is heard and she looks up at the window. Cuts to inside the janitors room where he voices over the same lines he does on the phone.",imqf5b

g5hnwxx,"I understand what you're saying, and I believe that's what the film was trying to do, but it didn't achieve that in my experience. I disagree that the three perspectives are interchangable: in fact, I thought some of the most compelling sequences were when Young Woman resisted whatever Jake projected on her ('Ames? That doesn't sound like my name'). I felt like she was distinct from Jake and the Janitor: she was part him, part his idea of a perfect woman, and then something beyond that. The film spends the majority following her and her experience, and I thought it was unsatisfying that they dropped her half an hour or so before the end.",imqf5b

g4fyzma,This does make a lot more sense. I wish it would've been a bit more obvious in the scenes that showed it was all the progression of an old man's fantasy.

It is a very subtle film which may disappoint many.",imqf5b
g5k9bfn,"I don't think your arguments are all that obvious to most people. Linking some of those things together in real time were not likely to happen unless you knew about the film going in. Or maybe you just have a great memory and eye on details. 

Ex: Frozen lambs says a lot about the characters fate... not at the time we see them. He's just showing her around the farm. Why would I possibly read that deep into that scene unless I knew the general narrative or structure before watching the film.

That quote you mention from the first scene narrated by the woman, that led me to believe the film was her POV and later when things got weird that she was imagining what she'd have to deal with if staying with him. I took the title from the start to mean she's thinking of ending the relationship.

The car ride quotes were rambling too quick to make much sense of. What I did believe I understood was still taken from her perspective on ending the relationship with him.

I'm glad it all made immediate sense to you, but don't act like the film held the audiences hand through it. That really is not the case.",imqf5b
g6ejj94,"This explanation certainly makes me appreciate the film more. I love stuff that makes you think and isn't what it seems, so I was gripped from the start and I noticed all the things you mentioned, but still felt confused, because - since the narrative was all 'Lucy's' - i thought the inconsistencies were hinting at her own mental failings and that this was all her own fever dream. From that standpoint, the Janitor scenes didn't really make sense, though it was clear that he's Jake and maybe she's also Jake? Or there's a connection somewhere, at least. When she met the Janitor in the school I wondered if she was in a mental hospital or actually old and reminiscing, though we see her as young throughout the film. I don't know, i just left feeling very unsatisfied, and I feel like if you have to research a film to understand it then it's missed it's mark.",imqf5b
g5kbux9,"I think you’re right about everything, and the ... metaphor?... of her wanting to end things with Jake, being Jake thinking about ending his life... dang.

g4k2ux0,"That's absolutely the point. Look at the bookshelf scene where we see David Foster Wallace, Wordsworth, Pauline Kael, Anna Kaven, and Eva HD. All points covered in dialogues or the general exposition of the film. 

It's meant to be factitious intelligence.

Even something like the phone calls or her name changing didn't make a lot of sense until after I watched the movie and read up on it. 

I also never watched Oklahoma or knew anything about Pauline Kael so that stuff flew over my head - maybe it's more obvious knowing that background.

I never looked at my phone once, I had subtitles on, I focused mostly on that. So yes I did miss her pulling the janitor outfit out, I thought nothing happened during that scene, I thought she just pulled out a nightgown. Again, nothing within the promotional or Kaufman's previous works hinted at me needing to be close to my monitor to interpret bite size clues. I was under the assumption this was about the female character, not the male character. So I'm not looking for the clues that Jake is actually the protagonist, despite of course the janitor being an obvious sign. To me the characters are almost nonexistent, they're so weird and offputting that you're almost propelled to focus on general themes and messaging rather than have any stake in any one of them. I think the parent's more than back this up, it's ridiculousness to such an extent that you no longer look for character moment's and instead try to find meaning in the abstract. Which of course is just another red herring sort of misleading route this story can take you on.

I know people get offended when people make critiques about ""needing to pay attention"", it's not that I need to pay attention it's that what I'm being sold is completely different than what is being offered and I was not ready or prepared by the films own marketing to need to be point blank on my screen and picking up on every little nuance and clue. Fuck me right for forming expectations right? I just don't think it's a good marketing strategy and I don't find the characters or plot interesting enough to watch it again now knowing what the point it was trying to make is. That's all.  


EDIT: Also, even if I noticed the janitor outfit the film has not prepared me to make me link that event to the fact it's all in Jake's head. Why are the parent's so insane? If it's in his head? Why are they not fantasy more perfect versions of themselves? You mean I'm supposed to interpret these bizarre time travel esque events as a man working through some sort of what if scenario with no prior setup? I don't watch movies like that, I don't make giant leaps and I can't recall the last time I've seen a movie where I need to assume that such absurd things are happening. In hindsight it's all very obvious so you can look down on anyone who didn't get it instantly. But again, I don't like to assume and if anything this assumption completely wrecks the core protagonist which is the woman. Why should I care about Jake? Both of them are kinda miserable neurotic messes but Jake is unlovable, aggressive, weird, awkward and distant. We empathize with missed potential and ultimately the tragedy of someone ending up like Jake but in the present both are kinda just miserable.",imqf5b
g61p4d3,"> I wouldn't call it much of a reveal either since it's clear pretty early on that they're all in this janitor's head.

g4wvnd2,"If it were a cautionary tale about being a janitor, the wink at ""A Beautiful Mind"" >!(seen in his bedroom and then played out in his Nobel Prize fantasy at the end)!< would have been a terrible choice. The reason he alludes to ""A Beautiful Mind"" is because it was pure fantasy at the end. John Nash lived life in his own head much like Jake -- he had a tough time relating to people and was also a paranoid schizophrenic. While ""A Beautiful Mind"" portrays him in this heroic light with a Hollywood ending where he gives a speech about how much he loves his wife, in reality, he was not invited to give an acceptance speech, because they were afraid he might not be ""normal"" if he did. Until the movie came out, ""people"" didn't really accept him. It doesn't matter if Jake is a Janitor or a Nobel Prize winning Economist/Physicist, a man simply can't achieve his fantasies, because they exist only to be out of reach. If Jake feels he's failed because he's ""just"" a janitor, the acceptance speech scene shows how even Nobel Prize winning Economists require fantasies for their lives to seem perfect enough for a movie. Yes Jake's a janitor, but it's not as if the work is what tortures him. He's got issues >!with his parents, with his childhood, with his need to appear intelligent,!< but his work is more or less a place for him to be alone and let his mind work on those issues. I don't think the movie is some exposé on how lonely and creepy and weird janitors are. It's a step inside of the male psyche -- a portrait of male fantasy.",imqf5b
g4urlnw,"Yeah agreed. It's more about making genuine connections and not losing yourself to books/media/fantasies. I don't see how it was hateful to the 'working class' at all.

g4urh9a,"So it's just a coincidence that the guy is a janitor, and could easily just as well been a Harvard graduate turned millionaire?

One of the earliest hooks in the movie is ""who is this sad looking janitor man"", do you think he'd be as sad if he were a multi millionaire?  I feel like behind the verbosity there is something deeply problematic with the framing here.

Getting to know someone in a movie who happens to have similar interests with an increasingly unstable man is completely different from watching an increasingly unstable man's fetish fanfiction diary. Instead of seeing two characters echoing my own personal past creepy situation, I see a character being appropriated by the author (jake). 

I get what you mean. Like the girl is like the trans version of Jake. But her dialogue of knowing what's going to happen, of a break up, and the unnecessary imagining of visiting parents, it seems to imply Jake did had a real girlfriend at one point who came and is gone. There's no reason for him to meet his own parents, nor there's no reason for him to become uncomfortable being repeatedly refused to be taken home. I believe those parts aren't Jake but is based on the actual events. And that's what I sympathize her for. I can feel the fear for her in that situation. But now we know absolutely nothing about the real her, not even her name. This event happened but we can't know who she actually is. The her saying she got into this situation because of always saying Yes, that could very well be just an assumption on Jake's part as a way of coping. I sympathize with her on that part too, but I don't see Jake being a yes man, it's the opposite, with his tantrums and refusal to take her home so many times, and now that part is fake.",imqf5b
g4liga0,"It's silly to say there is logic here, but after it got super trippy and the reveal that the old man is jake, which wasn't too hard to guess, then it dawns you that it can't possibly be the girl narrating this whole time if this was the old man's head all along just from process of elimination. Then her morbid poem and the scene where she reads her own poem from the book a while back is recontextualized that she isn't actually the one getting lost in her timeline, these were all views from Jake's perspective. There definitely was a girlfriend, I think, but the girl we see is not the real one this whole time but I don't know, the sum of Jake's ideals and assumptions to why he thinks she dumped him perhaps

g4j202g,"I'm watching this movie right now but I've got almost an hour left to go so these thoughts may be way off base by the end. I think that she's a conglomerate of different girls that he wanted to connect with but never could on any real level. The main one possibly being the waitress, Yvonne. He was diligently looking for a partner that was extraordinary enough that the very fact that she chose him would force the people around him to see his worth. Subconsciously he also needed someone who could love him so unconditionally that he could accept and love himself.  I think that ultimately his deep rooted fears and feelings of inadequacy made him rely on external validation to fulfill him. That reliance caused every potential partner to become a mirror he was holding up to himself. He was incapable of seeing the people around him as more than just a reflection of himself and he didn't like who he saw. Regardless of how amazing the woman was, it didn't matter because he was never able to quiet the negativity in his own head. He is struggling with dementia at the end of his life and trying to come to terms with the waste of it all. Only now those thoughts and regrets are being filtered through a mind whose perception of time is altered and whose memories are sometimes intertwined. There's so much that speaks to the importance of the way in which we perceive ourselves and how that perception impacts our understanding and treatment of other people. The fear that he would never be enough or have enough left him debilitated when at any point he could have had a completely different life.",imqf5b

I also didnt enjoy the movie so I'm biased, but i think it's fair to say that, whether it was a fantastic movie or not, it didn't make any effort to be easily understood. It could have been more clear about being a figment of Jake's mind without watering down the films intentions.",imqf5b

With ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" I had no idea what was real, what was a figment of Jake's memory or his imagination, what's happening behind the extremely thick rhetoric, or whether there was any non-abstract narrative at all.

From an artistic perspective I can understand how the film is attempting to capture the scattered nature of thought and memory and how its warped by age.

Your whole comment is inaccurate. Jake isn't anymore pretentious or introverted than Lucy.

g434k5i,"Interesting takes. I think these answer my questions pretty well and tie the film together. 

The only reason I think arm rash girl saying it was varnish meant at the school was because towards the beginning we see the two blondes making fun of the janitor’s posture and then as he continues to walk by, we see arm rash girl walk towards the camera as the janitor is working on cleaning the hallway. Also because when Lucy mentions the dog smells, Jake appologizes for the smell, the same way the arm rash girl complained about the varnish smell which was likely at the school. The janitor was probably used to people complaining about the hallway’s smell. 

Also I think your answer for the dance scene jake vs other janitor jake is spot on. Jake mentions in the car with Lucy when they kiss that the janitor is watching them like a pervert and once janitor jake accepts himself he goes into the school naked and the pig calls him a pig as well. 


Now that I think of it, I wonder why the swingset was included and why Lucy seemed to be able to notice a lot of details and Jake seemed oblivious, which changed in the second half of the film where she became oblivious.",imqf5b

g43dqgg,"> Any idea what the BRR girl (with the rashes on her arm) was about? What was with the warning she gave her?

I had so many questions in the end that I completely forgot about the Tulsey Town subplot, lol.

I'd point out a few notable points:
* Jake is particularly uncomfortable with coming into contact with this place.
* The girl attempts to communicate an unclear warning to FP.
* Jake ends up very dissatisfied with what he got from Tulsey Town.

I have some ideas, but cannot articulate specifically what it could have been. It's something Jake desires, but probably feels inadequate and insecure about, and ends up dissatisfied with. Maybe poor performance in BDSM and roleplaying in previous relationships? Maybe a desire and attempt to be an alpha male but failed to do so and ended up hurting his partner?",imqf5b

He assigned a lot of recent thoughts from books and poems (none of which are ""the internet"" where SJW theories on old songs hide) to her but none of those assignments came in the form of an attack on his thinking like the rape song conversation did. He gave her no combative traits or thoughts against him until that moment when he decided to assign an agreeably cliche and tired feminist argument (read garbage) about a song to the girl and make the complete opposite of his own thinking. That's the only time he did that in the whole story and it came in regards to something he arguably would not have been exposed to (I don't buy the argument that because he reads books and poetry then he obviously reads quasi-feminist woke theories on the internet).

He ends up only seeing himself as those failures. We already know he has a tendency to relive the past, and how detrimental to your mental health constantly replaying all your life’s failures and inadequacies would be. Also if you have mental health issues like depression, it can actually make it harder to recall positive memories vs negative ones, because the negative memory has a more similar mental state to relate back to without cause (like using smell to bring you back to a different memory).",imqf5b

He doesn't really remember her name because he didn't really meet her, and some parts of the trivia night are even fuzzy.

Yeah, this is spot on.

However, I don't believe for a minute he's only had one of these encounters... there have been countless ""ones that got away"" because just like trivia night he never made the leap.  

So I also think the nice part is either explanation will fit and doesn't really change anything...",imqf5b

It made his Nobel Prize acceptance speech at the end sadder, because the cheesy feel-good message at the end of all romantic media is that ‘love will connect us through time and space and gives life meaning’, but what does that say to the people who go through their whole lives never experiencing romantic love?",imqf5b
g65f05j,"This is definitely how I took it too, but adding that we don’t actually know how the real “Lucy” felt about him looking at her, or maybe she didn’t even notice at all. It’s all a projection of his psyche and thus his poor self esteem. He’s self conscious that he’s creepy and that any woman he may look over at would think he’s just being a creep. That if he did go over and talk to her and ask for her number she would just say yes because she’s expected to say yes and that yes turns into more yeses (what she said to herself in the car) and that she never would actually have liked him and would just break up with him after a few weeks anyway. Even in his fantasy, he would never be successful romantically. A lot of people also took her constant changing as him being sort of an asshole and his fantasy girl never being good enough, but I took it as more of him changing her in hopes that maybe since he can’t change himself, he can invent a fantasy in which she changes and eventually becomes a person that would love him back. But because of his poor self-esteem, she never does. No matter her changes, he will still never be good enough for her. She’s thinking of ending things no matter what. He will never feel love, even in this fantasy he’s played out in his mind so many times.",imqf5b

Hmm, that's a fair assessment as well.

Well yeah, I wasn't implying she wasn't real, it would be a mix of real people he had met and ""missed out"" on.

Jake and icegirl both had rashes on their arms and were the unpopular ones. the ice cream girl was scared for them and told her they could stay they didn’t have to go forward. She also says the smell isn’t varnish and they should know that. I took that as his subconscious voice trying to help and stop them from reaching the answer to the repeating question. Like the voice urging him to get off this train of thought was just as concerned with maintaining the fantasy because it was essential in avoiding reaching the answer. First only breaking it briefly to remind him the smell is not varnish and likely are chemicals from his cleaning he is doing, that he should be more mindful of the fumes if working with them.",imqf5b
g51s6h2,I felt exactly the same way upon end credits rolling but if you look at some of the explanations online and watch it again paying attention to all the blink-and-you-miss-them clues you might actually find it to be more way more coherent and less ambiguous than Synechdoche.

g4ybhgr," I’m okay with watching a film a second time if it’ll add to the experience of the resolution of the first. I think something like The Sixth Sense for example when the ‘twist’ can actually be seen more clearly in a second viewing is enjoyable. Or Hereditary (or Mother! as you say) where once the viewer is aware of the resolution they can analyse the film in more depth. 

For me this film is neither of those. I think a film needs more (or maybe I should say ‘I need more’) of an actual resolution to be worthy of a second viewing and towards the end it became increasingly abstract and lost a narrative sense. I know you’re not saying it so it’s not a dig at you but I sometimes resent the implication that viewers who don’t enjoy a picture have somehow missed something. I think it’s up to the director to make it somewhat accessible to analysis. This was too non sensical for me.

It's all just him.fantasizing an ""intelligent highbrow"" conversation with a woman but his thoughts are just things actusl intellectuals have written about.

By breaking the contract between audience and author (as well as the rules and expectations of conventional cinema) Kaufman threw us into doubt, confusion, frustration, and uncertainty.

I took this interpretation as the pain of these fantasies just like the pain of him wishing he pursued his art. He tapes it to stop reliving these fantasies where he realises its not real and becomes painful. Yet even when his tapes these fantasies off he still claws at the door to come back in as living these fantasy are some of the only happiness he gets.

The fantasies are his only happiness yet resolve in his big regrets when he comes back to reality and i think this is reflected in many scenes lile varnishing the floor to get high and live in these fantasies for longer, we even see himself pull away from himself (the girl at the ice cream store when he warns himself its dangerous)",imqf5b

g4ujgg7,"In that moment she was being the ""cinema critic"" version of his fantasy, I believe there was a book in how childhood room that referenced a specific real life critic which she ten impersonates. But for example when she's telling the story of them supposedly meeting at the quiz she mentions him using words she didn't know, she mentions that a few times throughout the movie which seems to suggest once again his insecurity about his intelligence (he only got a diligency badge after all), he is insecure so he wants her to be smart but still not smarter than him or at least not in every area.",imqf5b

g43nie6,"I immediately thought it was because of that first shot with the Janitor and then him being Jake, then the combo of music in the school scenes and the fantasy.  Those alone tipped me off that this was in the Janitors head, but what did it was the fact that this was so fucking spot on to how I used to imagine scenes before I started actually telling stories.  It's exactly how someone who's seen a shit ton of stories but never committed to a medium and fully told them in it would imagine a story in their head.  

It just kinda clicked by the time the dinner scene started with the candles lighting suddenly and the dialogue skipping, the way you imagine someone say ""so how are you?"" in a fake conversation and your brain skips thinking the entire line and goes straight to the answer.  All of that was.... perfect.  I immediately knew what it was doing and why, and the fun came from where it would then go.",imqf5b
g456rvt,"Oh man, I wish I didn't figure out the twist so early. But by the dinner scene I think it was already pretty obvious that the Jake / Lucy narrative was a fantasy of the Janitor.   Even as early as the Oklahoma scene in the car ride to their parents - imo it was not subtle at all. What the janitor was experiencing at the time was being manifested in his fantasy, & I think the editing of the film cues you into that so quickly. 

BUT I think a lot of it has to do with expectations. I am familiar with Kaufman's other work & that sort of duel reality / fantasy narrative fits right along with the rest. Had I gone into the film expecting it to play out the psychological-THRILLER aspect more I maybe wouldn't have made the association so quickly. 

I don't know; I enjoyed the film, & I appreciate Kaufman's dedication to delivering a truly authentic experience. So many films that use a fabricated reality as its surface narrative hide those aspects until a certain point so that the ""twist"" can come more as a surprise to the viewer, but here, the film is surreal all the way through.

Of course my wife figured out that Jake was “writing” the story by that point and doesn’t understand why anyone thinks the title was about the young woman breaking up with Jake. At that point in the movie I thought Jake had to be a control freak or a serial abuser and that the basement held something dark and disturbing.",imqf5b

g446vrv,"I can’t tell you exactly because I went in having had read the book, but I would have sensed something of the like with the constant cutting to random shots of the janitor’s day mid-conversation that had no place to be there, as if Jake was recalling his day. The constant correction everyone was making for one another, the way Jake sat at the table like a supervisor tailoring what they should and shouldn’t be talking about, the way everyone disappeared and appeared whenever they wanted (the dog comes up as soon as she wants it to and Jake makes it happen.) The “you chose well” line regarding his parents. The childhood picture that was both him and her.



I’m not sure I would’ve known a hundred percent, but I would’ve assumed there was a multiple personality disorder twist at play at some point, since the very firstbthing I noticed was the floral wallpaper that was both in the janitor’s house in his very first scene and Jake’s parents’ house when they arrive there.

Holy pretentious batman. As a 'buff' I still think this was mediocre. He essentially had created a four hour film that repeats itself halfway through. Or from what everyone says, that's the best way to enjoy it. If I need to go read books/articles/interviews about what your movie meant in order to 'get it' then your movie is short a few critical parts.

And there are plenty of movies where I missed major things that needed googling. But said googling always revealed an 'Aha! 'moment for where I should have picked up on what was going on. For this one I'm just frustrated thinking how I was supposed to know these things.

Still beautiful cinematography, wonderful performances, and the first 80ish minutes -before you realize it's not really heading anywhere specific- were lovely.",imqf5b
g4u2l7g,"It wasn’t that I didn’t get it or don’t enjoy films with multiple themes. I thought Jake was the janitor the second time they showed him (it wasn’t subtle) and realized the GF/narrator and his parents/most characters were just characters in his mind fairly early on. It was clear the title of movie wasn’t referencing a break up. This isn’t as simple as The Witch was advertised as a typical horror movie but really it was something far better and some simps didn’t get it. 

I don’t think you need to be a film noir expert to enjoy this movie/most movies, but I did take some film classes in college and I really like several Kaufman movies. I’m not a marvel guy. I like weird dialogue heavy movies. This movie was just very boring and meaningless to me. Just because they mention Tolstoy and reference older art films doesn’t make it good. I agree it was a smart movie that was unique, the actors performed well, and Kaufman put a lot of thought into it but that doesn’t make it good. 

Literally the majority of the movie is two people who don’t like each other in car talking about nothing. Their dialogue didn’t reveal very much about the plot or the characters. It’s simply the inner monologue of a hopeless mad man and a lot of films have depicted that better. I don’t care that she can recite a movie review word for word. The only part of the movie that was remotely entertaining was the dinner scene and her walking through the house while things are changing. They literally spend a lot of the movie talking about better movies. The only thing the dialogue revealed that was remotely interesting to me is the possibility that he was sexually abused by his father, his fear of being gay or appearing feminine/his relationship with his mom, and how difficult it is for men to deal with sexual abuse when society doesn’t support them as much/there are far fewer depictions of men dealing with sexual trauma in art compared to a woman’s perspective. 

Then it ends with a silent dream ballet, him winning the Noble Prize, and a cute ambiguous did he kill himself or didn’t he ending? It was peak pretension and self indulgence. He literally shows us a dumpster full of ice cream cups to hit the audience over head with “see, he plays this out in his head a lot.” It was terrible. I was bored the entire time.",imqf5b
g4mlgq7,"To be honest, I enjoyed it a lot (I love trying to figure out wtf is going on in a movie and coming up with crazy theories) but it was also completely different from what I was expecting. From the trailer, I was hoping for creepy and surreal, and yes, a little more horror.

The actual movie was funnier, sadder, and much more referential than I expected. While the long conversations in the car and the abrupt switch to a musical at the end definitely work for the movie, I did not go in looking for poetry and film analysis.",imqf5b

gcfwptr,"No, it’s not that. Read plenty of the “niche” shit he mentions, and it seems like just that; niche shit meant to make people who’ve read one or two and lie about reading some of the others feel good about themselves. It felt like an unextraordinary yet existential musical theater kid’s wet dream, of the most masturbatory variety. I’m talking about forty straight minutes of just name dropping everyone but Camus (all while asking the “one and only” question, aka Myth of Sisyphus) in a row, with little of it bringing ANYTHING to the story beyond making “film community” types feel good. 

The whole time I watched it, I just kept thinking: “this is for people in snobbier communities, who need to not only tell people why it ‘went over their heads,’ but have so many English 301 reading requirements to make the list.” Having read every “niche” title he mentioned wouldn’t make the story remotely better. 

Add to that that he just wants to give people a bunch of “ACTUALLYYYYY” moments, whether it’s correcting “Baby It’s Cold Outside” historically or jerking off over a folded piece of paper with a hole in the middle that says “time is a flat circle.”",imqf5b

I definitely felt a bit of a disconnect between the source material and the movie. The added theme of musicals was interesting and I enjoyed them both but for different purposes.",imqf5b
g42qmyq,"The janitor and the boyfriend are the same person, the boyfriend obviously being the younger version of the janitor. 

The girlfriend was a real person that the janitor/boyfriend once met (remember the scene where the girlfriend tells the janitor that she thought he was a creeper and says describing him is like trying to describe a mosquito that bit you on a night 40 years ago) but whom he never ending up having a relationship with. She became a fantasy in his head, that fantasy being what we see in the movie: he brings a girl home to meet his parents. So, the girlfriend is also the janitor but in the sense that he made her up, if that makes sense.

This fantasy becomes corrupted by his ailing mental health, which is why everything is so weird and nonsensical. The reason the girlfriend's name and occupation/field of study changes is because the janitor/boyfriend has run this fantasy through his head so many times (as shown by all the discarded ice-cream cups in the dumpster) and is losing his mind because of either schizophrenia or hereditary Alzheimer's/dementia or both, so every previous iteration of the fantasy has gotten all jumbled up in his mind.

His parents are memories, but were once real. The versions of them that exist in the fantasy are the people he remembers them being before their deaths; it would seem that they both had mental health issues, hence why he also does. The parents are possibly exaggerated/heightened versions that are ""tainted"" by the janitor's mental disorder.

At the end of the film, the janitor/boyfriend commits suicide in the school, which is represented by the scene where he wins what appears to be the Nobel Prize and then sings the song from Oklahoma.

**EDIT:** Should have stated that I assumed he commits suicide because that's what happens in the book. However, thinking about it now, that may not have been Charlie Kaufman's intention. As other people have said, it would seem he actually dies of hypothermia in the truck. That's the major divergence Kaufman makes when telling the story.

Also since people have been talking about the dance sequence, the ending of the book is depicted in the dance. In the book, Jake and Lucy/Louisa/Lucia are pursued through the school by the janitor and subsequently murdered, which represents the janitor committing suicide. I personally like the ending of the book more, but alas.",imqf5b

It's the only book from the author that I've read, so I can't give you any recommendations on the other book that he wrote.",imqf5b

I'm a pretty tolerant movie watcher, like Stalker and Solaris and My Dinner with Andre are all wonderful and they're even slower than this movie, but I found myself really bored by the second car scene. Having two scenes of long rants in a car is hard to make interesting, and by the second one it just felt too mind-masturbatory to me. I also don't think the film did a good job of coveying perspective, as I initially thought the young woman was the perspective we were following given we heard her internal monolog, but then the film obviously switches. I'm a pretty observant film watcher and reading all the comments here about people saying it was obvious from the start that it was all Jake's mind has me baffled. I don't think the film conveyed that at the beginning at all, even with the janitor scenes which were obviously Jake. I like Kaufman's other films, but found this one really rough.",imqf5b

g4cwt0y,"Well different strokes for different folks.

My central problems are that the story is focused on Jake but the story never gives a reason to care about Jake. Yes, he's old, sad and jaded but why must I dig my way through purposefully obtuse dialogue to try to gain some vague semblance of his character? Maybe you can say I didn't look deep enough but I say the movie gave me no reason to look deeper. To me it was more a presentation of ideas and themes rather than an exploration. It put forward concepts but ultimately didn't do anything with them besides a mundane story that can be summarised in a sentence.

I understand there are those that like what I would call a ""Interpretation film"" as they like to piece together the symbolism into their version of a plot.

I guess the “big reveal” is in thinking how each of these characters presents a thought in Jake’s fractured mind. The suicidal man is taking one last look at what his life could have been in an idealistic world, but even then the dream girl he’s created is still thinking about breaking up with him.

The dance sequence went for too long and wasn't that effective tbh. Would have loved to see The Question worked in with the same visceral unease. I still think the movie was fantastic but I almost wish I could erase the book from my memory to properly enjoy it.,imqf5b
g42tive,"Same! I think that's one of the reasons I love the book so much was that I don't get creeped out and this book did it for me so I was really looking forward to a movie that would provide those feelings. I had reservations about how a movie would be able to translate those uneasy feeling, and thought it might be difficult with how the book is set up. But honestly the high school scenes should have been the easy part to do that with! Instead it dropped the horror and went with an emotional tug, which just pulled me out of being immerse in the movie. I need a Kickstarter to donate to for an alternate ending to be filmed lol. I'm sure the ending of the film isn't as bad as I'm making it out to be in my head, many of the commenters here seem to have enjoyed it, but I just can't separate the exceptions I had from the reality of the way it ended. I'm bummed.",imqf5b

Also I just looked up on IMDB and Yvonne is the vegan waitress in the movie as well as the person who was calling Jessie Buckley while they were at the farm house. I definitely think there is some identity crisis / collective unconscious theme going on. The pig tells the janitor as they’re walking in that were all one and if someone has to be the rotting pig, why not me? 

Also I agree that Jake might’ve been raped or molested as a kid. In the scene where it shows a picture of the child both characters think it’s their self. The young women later goes onto say that song was rapey and that she wished her BF was at the bar to protect her from the stranger.

It definitely seems to me that Jake was transitioning into death and becoming aware of being one with everyone and all experiences. But what do I know, this whole comment is very scatter brained lol",imqf5b

Synecdoche, New York remains my favourite Kauffmann outing, with being John Malkovich a close runner up, idk what it is, but i'm such a sucker for his wit in melding disturbing concepts with an almost cynical humour x) The way you so elegantly put it leans faith to interpretation and the dedication required in such a sophisticated portrayal of themes, such that many are turned off towards.

I may be very wrong in what i'm saying, i wont lie i havent actually gone back to watch since writing my last response XD i've thought about doing so ofc but i honestly think i prefer other Kauffmann movies such as Synecdoche, New York with Being John Malkovich being a firm fav, have you seen either of these also? i highly recommend x))",imqf5b
igtbp1a,"I'd also like to respond, all be it months later, to the point/question you make on scenes where Lucy is independent from Jake, despite the popular theory being that she is, in fact, a fictional character. I've observed a running theme throughout Kaufmann movies, particular Synedoche leading upto his latest film, this being that our troubled protagonists are battling with a slow crippling realisation that unlike with what Hollywood media would like us to believe, we are not special/time is against us etc. Weird for the sake of being weird? I can agree with that, Kaufmann and others such as Lynch & Andersen go to extreme lengths for almost erotic symbolism, look at Mulholland Drive. However, i have found the way both movies correlate does intrigue me, Synedoche almost has a more uplifting/unifying quality to how it battles these direct themes, with its most famous quote arguably being 'Everyone is Everyone', everyone is in the same boat. Compare this to I'm Thinking of Ending Things, i believe Kaufmann intends both perceptions of the title to be correct, many, including myself initially, took the meaning further than Lucy merely breaking things off with Jake, instead looking at the film objectively from Jake's perspective in the wake of his eventual suicide. However, this does not discredit the original motion presented, our fictional character in Lucy is dissatisfied and at odds with her partner, and she's willing to call him out on his more cliche opinions throughout the film, take this from Jake's perspective, his psyche must be pretty outta whack if even his own manifested girlfriend doesn't want him, signs of crushing low-self esteem, makes for a much darker outcome for our protagonist compared to Caden from Synedoche, who at least at the end of his life has a friend.",imqf5b

I believe the burns show that she is Jakes true internal voice, young and untinged by adulthood, not a voice of anxiety or depression. He relates to her as the unpopular one of the kids in school (she is shown in hallways) and casts her to play the defense mechanism when the girls mocking threaten to break the fantasy down. She continues her defense mechanism role by breaking the fantasy to briefly remind him he knows that’s not the smell of varnish, defensive response to the mishandling and chemical burning. And then finally attempts to get them to stay but is cautious not to break the fantasy too much, knowing the fantasy kept him alive but desperate to get the train of thought to stop.

\*\*book spoilers\*\*

The book makes it much clearer what the story is about, although obviously some details are changed.

Jake is the old Janitor. He had potential childhood trauma, and was never really able to relate to people. He's actually very smart and at one point was on track to become a professor. But he couldn't handle the social interaction required, and settled for a job where he could be alone.

 He thinks back to a time he saw a girl at a bar and wanted to ask her out but never did. As he deteriorates mentally and grows older, he becomes almost non-verbal, and although he's good at his job, those around him begin to resent him. Unbeknownst to anyone at the time, he writes this story of what might have been had he just asked that girl out. Each character is, in some ways, a part of him as he's obsessed with the idea that we are all a composite of those that we were once close with. 

Ultimately, he decides that the girl would have eventually ended things with him, which brings him to ends things for himself (he kills himself). The notebook that contains the main story is found with him.",imqf5b

The basement is a metaphor for being trapped in your own head with bad thoughts. That’s why Jake is scared to go down there. There were no claw marks in the book just a big lock, basically trapped in your own head from the inside trying to claw your way out. It’s very sad.",imqf5b

g47pevh,"> It does make sense if you look at it as: she's just losing her mind and it's obviously a photo of her, and she's just been with his family for longer than she thinks.

Sure, if you look at the scene in isolation or if you haven't finished the movie. But scenes need to be interpreted within the context of the full work, and there are countless hints pointing toward the interpretation that the scenes are happening within Jake/The Janitor's mind.  


Part of me wonders if the word ""fantasy"" is throwing people off. Because I think it makes more sense to view it as something like a dream. The movie certainly follows dream logic. The characters come from the janitor's mind and therefor reflect him even while he isn't controlling them, just as the characters in your dream come from your mind even if you don't control them.",imqf5b

He fantasized about what could have been with a girl he met 40 years ago and also struggles with everything that has been with him personally, his family, his thoughts and loves and feelings. An ultimate loneliness to some degree. Jake has manifested all of these characters and melded them with reality. It seems like he still commits suicide in the movie through intentional hypothermia. I really liked the direction Charlie kauffman took with the movie because it wasn't easy source material to adapt. But he most definitely got the vibe and gist.",imqf5b

g4yqngu,"I think having her being the narrative anchor in a way is interesting. How does someone who is so broken, create someone who is so generally rational, scientific, opinionated, caring? Like maybe he’s imagining the ideal woman in one part of his life, or the one that got away. I’m seeing this tendency to play her as one of “his” characters, but it’s a lot more interesting when you see her as her own character whose unsure of her own identity as well. Its as if it’s a playing out of what’s happening in both of their heads at some point in time that is just outside the limits of the film. Like a new mental entity is born out of the interaction between two people.

I suspected that Young Woman, Jake and the Janitor were all the same person pretty early on, but still I couldn't bring myself to be equally invested in them (and I don't feel the film was either). We see the majority of the film from Young Woman's perspective and it is her discomfort and angst that informs the viewing experience. That's why I feel that the ending is unsatisfying, because it drops that perspective completely and then spends another half an hour on the Janitor's end. Even though everyone in the film is technically a part of Jake, I disagree that Young Woman's point-of-view is interchangable with that of Jake or the Janitor: she's part Jake, part Jake's idea of a perfect woman, and then something beyond all of that.",imqf5b

To me, the reason the become interchangeable is because she was created by Jake to fulfill the “wife shaped loneliness” in his life. But as his mind becomes older and he starts to lose control, this fantasy starts to meet parts of what make him self conscious, ashamed, or even embarrassed. Every thought/line she has though all has to connect back to Jake because he is the one thinking them. The sort of resistance we get from her (especially towards the end) is Jake’s realization that even if he talked and asked out this girl, she’d want to dump him within a month into their relationship. That even achieving his dream of having this relationship would most likely still leave him as forgettable as the actual experience of him just staring at her though out the trivia night (this is suggested by the line that she hasn’t brought him up to her parents and she doesn’t think she ever will). One fun experience I’ve had since watching this film is just trying to connect what the GF’s thoughts would mean in the context of it coming from Jake’s head.",imqf5b

g5l1iuj,"I’m a believer that most movies show you what they show you for a reason. Yes, we can’t read that deeply into the frozen lamb scene at this moment, but obviously there’s a reason why we see a cold, dead lamb on the ground before we even see the warm welcome to the farmhouse. They stay out in the cold awhile so we can hear Jake’s explanation of this, and the story of the pigs infested with maggots. Again, not too much to read into yet but clearly we’re hearing these stories for a reason. The young lady wonders what it’s like to live a sheep’s life, doing the same thing every day of its existence... and yes at that time I did link it to the Janitor but maybe that’s just me :) 


I’ll admit, I did watch the movie with subtitles so it was easier for me to keep track of everything the characters were saying.",imqf5b
g5o2102,Agreed. Aggressive response but yea I agree.,imqf5b
g62rkbp,"I think some things, like the frozen lambs, don't make sense until the end and no one could have seen that specific connection at the time.

But there's other things throughout that make it pretty clear the woman is in his imagination.  For example, her name changes and the story of how they met changes throughout the movie; her career and education change as well.  There's also different explanations given for why she needs to get home, but every time she says ""home"" he associates that with the farmhouse.  She didn't write that poem, it was from a book in Jake's bedroom; nor did she paint those paintings on her phone, they were in Jake's basement, inspired by an established artist.  It's also clear that when she's criticizing one of the movies they're discussing in the car that she's reciting it verbatim from a film critic's review including an apparent impression of their accent and speaking pattern.  Not to mention the fact that Jake seemed to interrupt her inner monologues at just the right moment.  Then of course, there's the moment where she's literally replaced with the actress from the film Jake (the Janitor) was watching.

I'm not saying it should have been *immediately* apparent, but I think it was at least clear by the time they left the house.",imqf5b
g5l20r4,"It’s terribly sad, but I also think it’s a beautiful metaphor. 
Adam Duritz from Counting Crows employs a similar metaphor, in many of his songs there is a reference to “Maria” even when the song is about another woman.  Maria is actually Adam’s female personality, and he calls on her to show him the things he doesn’t know or feel as comfortable with as a man. “Maria says she’s dying, through a door I hear her crying... why why? I don’t know.” 

I think this was the same type of thing used in the movie. The Young Lady wants to love Jake, wants to make things work, but she’s doubtful..

g4obvgs,"I thought it was super interesting. But it’s about letting your depression and anxiety control your life until all that’s left is regret and fantasy, and mental health is interesting to me, especially those two as I’ve dealt with both. So the movie ended up being a haunting reminder of what it felt like to fall down that spiral. 

Like having only painful memories labeled and accessible to him on his bookshelf in the form of dvds, when he admits he watches to many movies.. that it can be like a virus that makes you into it. The dvds include titles: futile efforts at success, lost/abandoned friendships, lasting memories of sorrow, unforgettable mishaps, the ways people have looked at, missed opportunities, humiliation, lost hope, recurring dreams of failure. If this is all that you see of yourself then it will consume you until that is what you are.


That hit home. The more depressed you are the easier it is to remember painful memories, like a smell would trigger a memory so can your mental state. The worst is on repeat and easy to bring up, the good memories unlabeled and lost. It’s worse here because we know he is losing his memory and that’s why things start being labeled, but the good memories don’t even get labels. They would have been the first to be lost, the least visited. That’s my nightmare. To have another spiral into depression, at any point it feels like it’s always there, and lose memories of the hope needed to get back out.

g4ohkd0,"Interesting perspective! I saw his childhood bedroom as his long term/passive memory storage. The books and porn don’t match the kids bed. (But jake mentions he still feels like a kid inside until he passed a mirror, so of course he still needs the kid bed.)

In the room we see the trivial pursuit, all the books referenced, porn, Jimmy’s ashes, horror movies (tend to leave an impression), and more dvds/vhs with most blank. Dvds labels are: futile efforts at success, lost/abandoned friendships, lasting memories of sorrow, unforgettable mishaps, the ways people have looked at, missed opportunities, humiliation, lost hope, recurring dreams of failure, (two others I can’t read). His father then says they’re labeling things since the memory is fading. A depressed person has a passive memory that constantly brings up painful “movies” like those all the time. 
So the reason those books are there is because those are the ones he liked enough to reread or commit to memory somehow. Because he quickly shifts scenes when talking about things out of his depth because he has to try hard to get to that level of competency.",imqf5b

I'm not saying the photograph and janitor outfit moments were smoking gun moments that laid the answers out to the viewer but it definitely planted a seed in our heads that had us theorizing all the possible scenarios that were actually at play here. The movie gives you the puzzle pieces and asks you to piece them together, you might not get the whole picture, because of the musical references, but you might get most of it if you bother to ruminate on what was going on... Stuff like the subtle outfit changes should have at least prompted the viewer to wonder wtf was going on. I didn't figure EVERYTHING  out either, but to paint this movie as a waste of time because everything wasn't immediately obvious on first watch is a terrible standard. 

This basically justifies checking out from a movie as soon as it starts throwing a curveball at you. There are a ton of films where not everything makes sense until a rewatch or when discussing with others, movies are supposed to prompt discussions anyway. To say you've been conned because you didn't figure everything is an overreaction. It's ok to not understanding everything on the first watch. I would imagine anyone that feels this way gets angry at plot twists for intentional narrative misdirects. There's also been a lot of misinformation about this film that gave people preconceived ideas of what it was supposed to be ""horror movie!! Yesss!""",imqf5b
g5b8j2g,"Response at your edit, I enjoyed both leads and their performances, but we found her negative attitude to be annoying had she been someone we knew in real life. Jake was trying his best to be talkative, social and upbeat. On the other hand, she had a bad attitude, was being negative and didn't throw him a bone with many of the topics that he kept bringing up. Maybe she's intended to represent how he wasn't connecting with many women in the course of his life but on paper she was significantly more obnoxious and unlikable than young Jake. She was being distant shooting down many things he brought up. She definitely was her own flavor of weird and awkward.

g59mxob,"I'm not offended at you disliking the film. I had subtitles on as well. But even if you were distracted by subtitles, the movie and filmmaker are not responsible to to preface it  with 'make sure you to pay attention!' i think most movies expect the viewer to do that. I am not sure what you think you were sold, but sounds like you wanted more accurate marketing? What would have been a more accurate marketing of the film? ""Dramatic Film With Potential Plot twist and demands your full attention"". Who sold you the movie into what you were expecting when you hit play? Some people bashed the film for not being horror so, is it the movies fault because some clickbait threads on reddit called it a horror movie from Kaufman?

Forming expectations are fine, but clinging to those expectations in the face of narrative clues that subvert your expectations is really ODD. It sounds like you are just against the idea of movies throwing any curveballs at the viewer, making sudden left turns or having a plot twist.. ""I thought the gf was the protagonist, but it turns out she was only in the mind of the janitor, FUCK THIS MOVIE""

Even if you were expecting the gf to be the protagonist, the movie threw enough hints at you to suggest that this wasn't the case, and just because your expectations were subverted, it doesnt mean your time was wasted or that the movie was bad.

""What age should the parents be? Maybe middle aged? No it's better if they are older.""

""The father's bandaid is on the right side of his forehead. No maybe it's on the left side.""

g4uuxuy,"I didn't see it that way at all. The janitor is Jake, and it's clear that Jake is an intelligent and well-read guy; it's not clear whether or not he went to college, but if he didn't, it wasn't because he was poor. His parents aren't rolling, obviously, but they do have a farm and he's their only child, and he comes across as someone who could easily get some scholarships and student loans (especially in the 1970s/80s which is when he was younger, and the tuition costs weren't as nuts as they are now). If he didn't go to college, the reasons were more inside his head that outside of it. 

He's a janitor because he has a horrible time relating to other people (nowadays he'd probably be see as on the spectrum in school, back then he'd just be That Weird Kid) and he's more comfortable retreating into his mental world and not interacting with actual people because he's afraid that they'll turn on him -- hell, even his own dream woman ends up getting angry at him because that's what he assumes will happen. A janitorial job lets you work alone. A Harvard grad millionaire could well become very depressed and isolated, and that could also be an interesting story -- but to be honest it would be much harder to make him sympathetic to the audience, it would be an entirely different kind of story, a Richard Cory take on things and the audience would be a lot less inclined to be sympathetic, no matter how unfair that might be. I think the fact that Jake is a janitor is partly to make him more relatable. 

I never got the message from the movie that being a janitor sucks, more that ""an unlived life sucks"". Jake has never really lived his life. He could have lived a happy life as a janitor, but for him that would have meant making the human connections he so desperately wanted to make. Actually reaching out to the girl at the bar, maybe having a family eventually, sharing his favorite books of poetry with his kids and his friends, going to see the movies he enjoys and really discussing them with people. He could do all of that while holding down a job as a janitor.",imqf5b
g4usor2,"He’s sad not because he’s a janitor. In the book he’s actually really smart and worked in a lab but chose to leave it because of the working condintions (constant need to talk with people). He became the janitor partly because that job does not require you to interact with people much, he works night shifts mostly.

Jake is a romantic, he wants to love someone and wants to be loved but he’s unable to do so because he has lots social anxiety since childhood, he also gets totally consumed by books and films. He could become a painter, a writer, a scientist but he didn’t believe in himself and that’s what eating him and that’s why he’s miserable, not because he’s a janitor.

g46gpto,">Why make it? There’s no entertaining story line to follow yet it has better ratings then most blockbuster films.

Not all movies try to do the same thing! Many movies try to tell an entertaining conventional story, but not all of them do. Some, like this one, try and explore different themes/ideas, explore a particular mood/atmosphere, or tell a story in a less conventional, experimental way.   


And that's okay! Not everything has to be for everybody. This is a movie about life, relationships, aging, regret, death, and all that stuff. The writer/director is an artist trying to tell a story that explores these ideas rather than trying to sell tickets or give you some escapism. It's just not that kind of movie.",imqf5b

Lucy's critique monologue with her cigarette (apparently a reference to a famous critic's work) - was great. That was the turning point for me because I thought she was mocking Jake by putting on a -i'm so smart- accent. And Jake looks a little hurt because he wishes he was as smart as Lucy.

It's funny how he gets frustrated with his ideal woman because he can't keep up - and instead just says things like 'I agree. .. ' 'I get that. . .' He wants to be surrounded with smart people but realises that he isn't as smart.",imqf5b

g4v2ujx,"yeah in the book I think they said that, but part of the reason why I really like the movie is because both sides work, you can believe either one and there's nothing in the movie that contradicts whichever you choose. Just like you could believe the young girl was someone he saw at a bar and didn't have the courage to talk to, or, she was an ex girlfriend of Jake's that left him heartbroken, there's nothing fundamentally contradictory in the movie about either stories, you're free to believe whichever you want, which is extremely rare in a movie",imqf5b

g4n448j,"I mean that’s the point. It’s meant to be a mess so you can realize that your narrator is an imagined person. It took me way longer to realize jake was our true “narrator” because I was stuck on her perspective and trusting the narrator to exist. 
How can someone enjoy that? Because every line of dialog and every single prop and piece of clothing is placed with intention and if you like paying attention to details it rewards you for it. It has something to pick apart and I enjoyed it more the second time doing so. You receive critical information from start to finish. One of the first scenes shows the janitor looking down at her through his window, she can hear his thoughts as she looks up at the window, her face bothered like it is interrupting her monologue, it cuts back to jake being at the window now instead of the janitor, the thought is the question she receives in the voicemail.",imqf5b

She has an internal world yes, but introvert? she seems sociable, very active based in the amount of things she do, shes obviously tired of being with Jake so obviously shes looking for something more exciting than him.
Shes pretentious? shes only giving him his own medicine. She fails doing conversation? Jake his throwing pseudointelectual stuff all the time, all the time trying to impress her, insted of just being normal, i mean.. in the dinner she said it, she just want a normal conversation, so shes introvert for that, wut?.

g4fkayx,"I think the film is an expression of the deep loneliness that some people experience. Even the first two acts, before the veil is lifted, show characters that are together yet exude a feeling of deep loneliness (like a picture of a place that makes you feel something even if the place itself doesn’t have any inherent feeling to it). It’s an examination of the daydreams we use to occupy our minds, how real they can feel, and how we tend to construct them as a way to deal with the inherent loneliness we all feel. The pseudo intellectual angle is related to the janitor character, who strived his whole life to be smarter (better as he perceives), railing against gods parents for being too simple, reading poetry and nonfiction books, as well as watching films to scratch the itch. His mom comments in the film that he’s not gifted, but he works so hard to learn, which is more important.",imqf5b

g4u1pe5,"I mean, why did he make her a critic of  A Woman Under the Influence? The girl was changing in his head pretty constantly; a physicist, a poet, a waitress. It was based on his consumption of media - the book about critic Pauline Kael, the Zemeckis movie he watches on his break at work, the fast food commercials he watched as a kid. He wanted to be this smart guy who could keep up with an accomplished woman, but he wasn't smart - just diligent. Hence ending up as a janitor at a high school. 

I think it's reasonable he could be reading up online about all sorts of stuff with his free time, or overhearing conversations in the hallways of the high school (or while he's doing his peeping tom thing). It manifests as another reason he should kill himself, because he's out of touch and won't land some young pretty 'woke' girl and can't actually keep up with them.",imqf5b
g4tx4sq,Why would she constantly be thinking about ending the relationship? Why would his parents bring up deeply embarrassing things about him? Why is he mocked by the young women at the ice cream shop? It's because Jake is a deeply insecure person. His insecurities run so deep that he can't even create a fantasy they don't penetrate and destroy.,imqf5b
g4v1dvp,"He was not just reading generic ""poetry"" -- the poem he had her recite was from an anthology by a feminist poet which only came out five years ago. If that's the sort of thing he's keeping up with, then he can absolutely be familiar with a stale internet hot take which is at least 15 years old and probably older. And she's pushing back at him in little ways even from the beginning -- the thought about how she'll never introduce him to her parents, pressing him about the swing set and how weird it is even when he's uncomfortable talking about it -- she gets more and more hostile as the movie goes on because he can't imagine her happy and comfortable, and that's where it really first shows itself openly but it's not some sort of sudden turn, it's more like the culmination.",imqf5b

g83z2il,"> When I think about ‘Eternal Sunshine’ (which I love) it marries the story, the themes and visual artistry together to create the masterpiece.

Because Eternal Sunshine grounds all the crazy delusional fantasy visuals in reality (it's the dream world, dreams are always weird). Then, it has the payoff that we all want, the happy ending.

The entire point of this movie was that his entire reality is marred by fantasy and delusion, from the very beginning we are struggling to pick out what's real and what isn't, and then he dies alone and sad and that's the end. It's reality. It's not a storybook ending made for us to feel good, like we got some big payoff for our efforts.

Lucy's perspective taking centre was in specific contrast, upheaval, and fragmentation to Jake's fantasies. She is her own agent, even as a character within a narrative within a narrative, which upsets the power and control of the author of the internal narrative. Jake realising he doesn't and never had complete control over the narrative of his life and the characters in it is what finally destroys the facade of fantasy and idealism that he presumably used as a crutch to actually seeking fulfillment in his real life, and the disempowerment of acknowledging this broke and killed him.",imqf5b

And I thought that the moments where it felt like a script was being read so to speak, were actually inside someone's head. 

Her outfits seemed to match the decor theme of his parents' home. I took that as a clue. And only as he took his clothes off and left his truck, did I realize that the movie's title had been a misdirection.

I felt jake and the janitor were the same person after ten min when she is describing jake in the car and then it continues her descriptions of them over scenes of the janitor at work. Something about the janitors demeanor and the cut from Jakes face to the janitor. Then the scene when she first gets to the house and when she is talking about death and how some animals face reality, it shows the janitor for when she says some animals like us don’t face it and create false hope. Paraphrasing because I don’t remember the exact quote. 

It was hard for me to have the aha moment until after because it was hard for me to see her as part of his imagination too, probably because she is the narrator. Once I read that it all clicked.

EDIT: I wanted to rewatch the opening sequence her monologue is in Jakes house like going down in the morning and the first time you see her, her monologue is interrupted by the janitor looking out his window mumbling the start of what he ends up saying on the phone calls. It shows her looking up and disturbed almost and when it goes back it’s Jakes back at the window instead of the janitor. Then they start their drive.

Its a two hour and fifteen minute movie.  I'm not sure if you're trying to exaggerate it's boring nature or if you're misguided.  

Kaufman has cited multiple times that although he has a conclusion of what the film ultimately meant, he doesn't give a fuck about that.  You're supposed to do that part yourself.  I pieced it together perfectly fine; Janitor regrets living his life without taking chances, creates a woman based on a missed chance, has her go through his troubled past, and she slowly becomes her own entity as the more he tries to change her to fit his own self image, the more she undermines it.  He realizes in the end that she is a reflection of his own self love and hatred, and he kills himself.  I hadn't seen a single analysis of this film upon coming to that conclusion, it's  just what I parsed.  

You didn't get it and I'm sorry you didn't, but that doesn't make it bad.  Art doesn't always have to
be one and done; some of the greatest pieces have to be studied for years to fully understand them, and that's okay.  It just doesn't groove with you, which is my point in the first place.  This is a film a very specific type of person who either likes to analyze or likes to
be emotionally carried without needing to understand anything will love.  If you are not that kind of sadist, then you will not enjoy this.  I'm not making some grandiose statement, here.  It isn't a claim of superiority.  It's entirely taste specific and I'm saying that film buffs generally tend to be the only types of people that are willing to analyze a film or be carried by it without fully understanding it.  That's the nature of being someone who is a film lover.",imqf5b

The feeling of watching someones broken fantasy, when we realise the girlfriend isn't our pov character but actually another disjointed part of said fantasy, how her accent and personality changes from scene to scene, is jarring in all the right ways for me. The way her occupation, name and mannerisms change showing how revised this fantasy is. 

Things that keep us from being completely settled in this world, like the sound of the storm starting and stopping seemingly at random. 

I just feel like the themes of regret, and time are well explored, we've all been there, running a scenario over and over in our heads, revising the details, trying to make it perfect. Then realising it's all over and we're too late, we had our chance and it's too late. It's just something that really resonates with me.",imqf5b

We're confused, doubtful, and frustrated along with the tormented protagonist.

The ending was nothing short of disappointing, I can even give kudos to Kaufman for alluding to ""A Beautiful Mind"" but I can't forgive him for his misgivings. Reid's book was a poignant look into mental health issues, loneliness, loss, despair, and the ways one undergoing this feelings may act, think, and live in order to cope.

The janitor enters his car and begins to become haunted by the glitches in his fantasy. His walking into the school naked on the way to ""accept his Nobel prize"" almost seems to indicate that Jake is doomed to continue fantasizing a better and more ideal story for his life.

In the book, Jake more or less comes to terms with his fate once he realizes that his fantasy failed, and even if he had given her his number, she (and later him) would have ended things anyway. In the film, I feel like no such realization occurs. Instead, he is literally led on a path back into the school to continue mentally rewriting his life story. The pig definitely said some important shit that might make or break my case, so I need to pay attention to him on my next watch.

My husband also pointed out that a common symptom of hyperthermia is the person getting very agitated and loopy and wanting to take off all their clothes, which we see him do.

I think the fact that the girl convinced Jake that the song ""Baby, it's cold outside"" is a song about rape / coercion kind of nods to the fact that the janitor raped a girl at some point. I think the girlfriend is kind of like his conscience in a way. Not letting him convince himself that what he did was justified. 

Also, why was there a picture of the girlfriend when she was younger on the wall in Jakes house? What was that showing us? Originally I thought that we were going to find out that the girlfriend was actually the real Jake but it didn't really turn out that way.

If in the first watchthrough those car scenes read as the uncomfortable experience of a woman struggling to get through the last painful/awkward encounter of a relationship she knows is doomed, then the second watchthrough will be the abstract internal monologue of a sad, suicidal old man (represented by Jake) who is trying to reason with fantasies and memories that he can no longer stop from rejecting him. I'm actually very curious to see if Kaufman pulled that off. That is, did he artfully stage and edit those scenes in such a way that they can be focalized successfully with either protagonist? 

I don't mean that it's a film like Identity or Fight Club or The Usual Suspects where knowing the twist/reveal makes you more attuned to visual hints or inscrutable dialogue, and creates some dramatic irony for the protagonist's journey, but our attachment to them as the center of the film is not fundamentally changed.

The father also never addresses Jake directly at the table but talks as if Jake isn't there, showing how distant they always have been.

I also thought it was strange that as Jake's mother is lying dead in the bed and Jake is crying by her side, the young version of the father walks into the room, completely detached/oblivious of the situation happening, which might be something from Jake's childhood when Jake was maybe constantly ignored by his father.

I was giving the film my fullest attention and certainly noticed all the clues that you are mentioning.

In my opinion, you cannot reasonably expect most sincere film viewers to figure this out while they are watching.


The point is, when you're someone like me who is genuinely trying to piece together the clues and ends up entirely missing the mark - there isn't anything on a surface level to really fall back on, and that's the difference from Kaufman's earlier films.

I finished the movie and that's my interpretation. The official explanation makes no sense whatsoever.

Yup. Which is why I'm cemented on my view.

> and there are countless hints pointing toward the interpretation that the scenes are happening within Jake/The Janitor's mind.

Care to share? The guy ain't even the protagonist. There's no reason to think it's a fantasy of his. There's no reason to think that the events didn't play out as shown. If the film had followed *him* instead of *her* then I could see your point. But it doesn't.

> Because I think it makes more sense to view it as something like a dream.

There's no reason to think any of it is a dream though. And if we do assume it's a dream, then it's reasonable to think it's *her* dream, not *his.*

> The movie certainly follows dream logic. 

Wat. It really doesn't though? If you follow the guy's perspective the plot is really simple: he drives to his parent's home with his new gf, has an awkward dinner, and drives back. We see him at various points in his life caring for his parents, and at the end of his life when he's a janitor and kills himself. There's literally no reason to think any of that is a dream.

>  The characters come from the janitor's mind

Why would you think that his parents, the people working at the dq, or the girl he brought home ""come from his mind""? That doesn't really make sense. He even has a photo of her. Are you saying he walked to the barn to show.... no one? Why would he order 2 of the ice creams if there was no one else? Why do you think he's controlling them? It's clear he's quite frustrated with their antics. His parents are quirky and developing pretty severe mental illness. And his gf has clearly lost it as well. Other than wanting a normal life I haven't seen him really ""control"" anything.

> just as the characters in your dream come from your mind even if you don't control them.

Except we see him fall in line with the rest of the time-jumping scenery. IE he's a part of the surrounding environment (the family at the home, the janitor in the school, etc.) and not the singular protagonist moving through the scenes. It's *abundantly clear* that the main character is the girl, not the guy. So if it is a dream, then it would be her dream, not his.

Or perhaps the movie is so dogshit it can't even communicate it's protagonist properly?",imqf5b

I doubt anyone could tell the real meaning of this movie if he never googled or read the book or at least the plot summary  of the book.  


In the movie, the director/writer used a lot of tricks to keep us away from the real plot.

I could get on board with this - one of the creepiest moment was when the serving girl (“no, we met while you were serving me” says plemmons after the girlfriend explains the fake trivia meeting”) says “I’m scared for you” while plemmons refuses to look/acknowledge the real girl while focusing on the fantasy version. 

The only reason imaginary real girl would say such was if they had at least some more interactions - perhaps her recounting of the trivia meeting is HALF true. 

I’m scared for you. 

She spent some time with him, got close, perhaps met his parents.... !!! and then wanted to go home, which is why we’re here at this moment in the story reminiscing about the closest thing to something that he had.

Edit: thinking some more: she totally met his parents and then ran away scared - which is why plemmons would focus back on this moment. 

His parents scared her away - he wanted her to see all the good he does for them, but he is them. He’s imagining if it could have gone any different. 

She could’ve seen what he does and acknowledge that you have to take care of family and he was doing what he could - instead the reality is that she got freaked and ran because he’s crazy because his parents were. 

Did he kill her? I thought that’s where it was going but he doesn’t seem to manifest guilt... when the old version of imaginary girlfriend applauds him...

g47ahya,">! Throughout Wasp Factory we hear from the protagonist's brother Eric who seems to have gone mad via phone calls. Later on we find out he had a traumatic experience as a field medic when he saw live maggots eating a child's brain (yeh there was a big controversy at the time) which is a similar image to the one Kaufman uses with the pig. When Eric returns to the secluded Scottish island where the novel is set, the protagonist's first clue that he is back is when he sees some sheep and a dog have been set on fire. In this film, Jake makes reference to what will happen to the lambs - ""probably burnt"" Burning animals in wasp factory is seen as a rejection of modernity and a wilful return to living in a more primitive way of animal sacrifice rather than trying to navigate the complexities of a modern existence!<


Excerpt from Wasp Factory - ""The light grew stronger, and something came running over the top of the big dune, something burning and screaming and running down over the sea-face of the Skull Grounds dune. It was a sheep, and it was followed by more. First another two, then half a dozen animals came charging over the grass and the sand. In seconds the hillside was covered with burning sheep, their wool in flames, bleating wildly and running down the hill, lighting up the sandy grass and weeds and leaving them burning in their fiery wake.

Foe seems to have a lot of good reviews, so maybe it's just me. It's way more conventional than 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' and without spoiling anything, just seems like a whatever-tier Black Mirror episode to me with some goofy, predictable twists.

It's funny with Black Mirror... I think there are some great episodes, I like the show. But overall, in its 5 seasons they have kinda over-saturated the marketplace with like every go-to scifi premise. So when you read or see something that seems exactly like what they would have done, it's hard not to compare. I can't decide ultimately if I find that commendable or sort of annoying about Black Mirror. I guess what it makes me think though, is that while Black Mirror is still fresh enough in everyones' mind, people who do projects now that seem like they could have been an episode of that show, should do more to kind of differentiate.

Before all this, the last thing I had read was Annihilation, which was also short (and because I really like that movie, which is a weird one too, but it did it for me). It's good book also.

My point is the SJW attack from the girl when he merely mentioned popular song lyrics (which did nothing except accurately describe the current weather they were experiencing) never happened to him and never came close to happening to him so why would he create that version of her during this delusion about the great life he missed out on by not actually having been with her?",imqf5b

It wasn’t just a flippant fantasy of “what ifs”... it was a true struggle of coming to grips with reality.

The ones that go in series are probably better to talk about in terms of sophisticated anime since you have things like: Ping Pong The Animation, March Comes in Like a Lion, Violet Evergarden, hell even FLCL. It’s probably not the best example but they have an action anime where they have characters fight in almost-full nude yet at the end it makes complete sense why and you just want to cry at the grand epicness of the story.

Like of course I knew he was the janitor, of course I figured the action was all ‘interiority’ (thanks for drip feeding us that one, Charlie). I’ve watched movies like this for years and I’ll put up with a lot of self-referential wank and eye-rolling David Foster Wallace digs - all that in return for some payoff. I can forgive a lot if it comes together in some way. Not “everything resolves neatly and every bread crumb points to something”, but the film reaches some endpoint in a way that might be called successful. 

This started off with an incredible set-up, tension and atmosphere that any horror director would kill for, some killer performances, did I mention tension, I even thought some of the long car conversations were interesting, and a great bag of tricks employed in its filmcraft that kept the sand shifting under you at all times - see again, tension.

Sadly, this line is trotted out so often to excuse unsuccessful films by ‘brilliant’ directors that it’s become a cliche. There have been many great uncomfortable films. One needs to do more than just dissatisfy by setting out to frustrate the expectations of an audience that, fairly, probably expects to be frustrated, to qualify as ‘transgressive’. 

I’ve seen films that were unenjoyable but good, but this ain’t one of them. 

Actually, strike that, two thirds of it was deeply unenjoyable and very good, but the last third failed. A film needs to make me feel something powerfully about the story and it’s characters, something that can hang in the air as the credits role, to count as ‘powerful’.

He's just living in his own fantasy.

I also think he does realize she wouldn't stay with him, in the scene where she tells the janitor directly he was a creep. but I don't know if its true, its obviously his imagination of her and she carries his anxiety and fears. He doesn't seem to like himself, So obviously his dream girl wouldn't want him.

I think the uncertain narrative told from the perspective of an unreliable almost beg ambiguity in the ending.

A couple of things stand out here toward the end, as it becomes evident that the fantasy and memories (which have become increasingly indistinguishable) are more in the driver's seat than he, the Janitor, is in the present.

\-The soft-serve stand: Jake's mentioning that ""they wouldn't serve us if they knew it was me,"" makes it clear that he's not entirely in control (assuming we've determined by now that this is a fantasy sometime in the past), and the girl mentioning not having to go forward in time indicates that yes, he knows that some part of him is trapped in this past fantasy. To a large extent, the simulacra fantasies and memories have already become his reality. There are a number of points in the movie that I believe reinforce this. I think Jake largely admits it in the discussion about jumping off the train and movies being a lie that we use as a substitute for reality.

\-They constantly refer to not just very specific quotes from literature and film, but interpretations thereof, both universal and intimate. I don't know if the part about color and everything else existing only in our minds is mentioned in the book, but I think it's a pretty good device to justify ambiguity. So, back to the ending. I think as much of a meta-commentary of literature and film as it is, I think we see two strong symbols that could indicate either interpretation. We've seen Jake both as the Janitor and how he sees himself in the past, but in the final stages of hypothermia, he strips away the illusion and we see a suffering old man. But then he goes yet another level down into his own memories, fantasies and delusions as elderly version of how he sees himself in the past, into the play - a crude simulacrum of the fantasies and memories that already only exist as simulacra in his mind. 

Whether that means he's ""come to terms with it"" and realizing he's failed (in this case probably just totally giving in to the fantasy and/or his inevitable mortality), actively continuing to try to rewrite his past, or literally just suffering the last sparks of a delusional mind, I'm not sure it matters. The piece being such a meta-commentary on interpretation of literature and cinema, I think we're allowed (probably intended) to wildly speculate on its symbolism ad absurdium. 

Final thoughts: I'm guessing we're probably giving a more concrete and easy-to-digest form to what essentially boils down to a portrait of the increasingly incoherent mind of a troubled elderly person, a universal but very specific story that's been overlooked, untold, and forgotten uncountable times since people have been around.

If I get around to reading the book, I'll probably have a different point of view. But having just watched it then reading your comment, that's my take.",imqf5b

If you read a plot synopsis of that musical, the first act of Oklahoma ends with the main character having a laudanum-induced hallucination, which the audience sees as a “dream ballet.” The dance in the movie is literally exactly a 1:1 recreation the dream ballet from Oklahoma, where the main woman character and the main hero character dance together in love until the main antagonist interrupts and stabs the hero.

There is extra resonance in the use in the film though because in the musical, the “bad guy” (Jud) in Oklahoma who kills the “good guy” (Curly) is also a “dreamer” who keeps saying he’s going to get his life together and get the the girl and achieve his dreams—but then he does nothing. In the film, the young Jake represents the hero Curly-archetype who is successful, while the janitor represents the Jud-archetype who is just a fake dreamer with no real future.

If you read a plot synopsis of that musical, the first act of Oklahoma ends with the main character having a laudanum-induced hallucination, which the audience sees as a “dream ballet.” The dance in the movie is literally exactly a 1:1 recreation the dream ballet from Oklahoma, where the main woman character and the main hero character dance together in love until the main antagonist interrupts and stabs the hero.

There is extra resonance in the use in the film though because in the musical, the “bad guy” (Jud) in Oklahoma who kills the “good guy” (Curly) is also a “dreamer” who keeps saying he’s going to get his life together and get the the girl and achieve his dreams—but then he does nothing. In the film, the young Jake represents the hero Curly-archetype who is successful, while the janitor represents the Jud-archetype who is just a fake dreamer with no real future.

Also, in Oklahoma, Jud later kills himself on accident when he falls on his own knife after picking a fight with Curly. That’s sort of what happens to the janitor getting hypothermia.

g5g0gbb,"I watched without reading and felt it was pretty clear. I didnt catch everything but the idea that it was all Jake the janitor misremembering his past and being regretful and suicidal was definitely obvious to me.

Theres so many little things I missed...but yeah I felt I understood it after one watch without the book.

But to be fair I saw a lot of myself in the themes and Jake, so it wasnt hard for me to make the connections.",imqf5b
g42m43w,The book made it seem more of a split personality type situation. The movie is it seemed like more of a sad delusion. I have to admit I’m a little disappointed because I really liked the book and I was hoping for surreal David lynch horror ending. It did not happen. The third act kinda dropped the ball and I think it lost almost all of the punch from the book.,imqf5b
g42mip6,"I guess those interludes wouldn't feel as natural in the type of film Kaufman wanted to do, but the film also makes it less clear about the split personality thing. Especially by not having that brother of Jake that sorta represented the janitor's mental issues",imqf5b

g4bf4xd,"I don't think Jake is highly intelligent, that's part of his fantasy too. This is more clearly demonstrated regarding the prize he won for diligence rather than acumen.   
  
In his constructed fantasy he's intelligent and accomplished and can hold his own when discussing physics/medicine with his girlfriend",imqf5b
g42wljd,Defiantly in the book he does. I don’t really get that from the film. He seems to be recounting what he wishes his life would have been like. While not being able to hold his fantasy together.,imqf5b

g4nbuf3,"When the “young woman” is scared waiting for jake to come back from the school,  she wonders how long it takes to die from hypothermia. She thinks it wouldn’t be a terrible way to go if she had to. I think that was to show it was truly suicidal. He thought about it and then said goodbye to his fantasy girl with a hug and his fantasy self with a stabbing. You see him decide to put the keys on the seat rather than start the car as well.",imqf5b
g4fh9ip,I think he chooses to freeze to death in the car but I guess wakes up from hypothermia and gets that urge to remove clothing and walks out and dies. The beginning of the movie with the wall patterns and all the trippy stuff when he’s in the car also makes me think he decided to take LSD and die but that may be reaching.,imqf5b

g4eoly6,"I know, it's ridiculous. I'm just as dumbfounded about it. I think it's because I found the conversation worse to listen to than the visuals of Solaris. Like having to listen to someone drone on about a topic you don't care about etc vs staring at ocean waves. I'd rather have the waves I guess.",imqf5b
g5r8b5d,"Not just unlikable, but painfully relatable i think. To me this was basically us watching a man tear himself apart while criticizing himself through the eyes of what's supposed to be an ideal girlfriend.",imqf5b
g4sree3,Maybe it's less likely to connect if you've never been that person.. Or even noticed one.,imqf5b
g4wi28s,"Boy isn't it smart that they put a counter to people that would criticise them for not making compelling storytelling by making them a blatant strawman too stupid to empathize unless it's spelled out for them. Aka, it isn't bad you are just too dumb to get it.

I don't need a person in a painting so I can empathize. I need a reason to look at the painting in the first place.

Or to spell it out, I understand Jake. I just don't have any reason to like or care about him.",imqf5b
g43j6vu,"It's hard for me to defend the pretentious monologues because I agree that they are beyond annoying, but I feel the need to anyway. The book presented these monologues in a way that felt pretty self-aware. Especially considering the fact that everyone is a character of Jake's creation (he himself seeming to believe that he is some misunderstood genius), it makes sense that both him and his girlfriend are constantly waxing poetic and making esoteric allusions to different literature and philosophy. It's all a part of his misguided notion of what a stable genius sounds like. 

The film stayed very true to this, but I think Kaufman may have failed to justify it thematically. It almost comes off as a terribly written YA movie in parts. The choice to make the characters speak like this was intentional and true to the book, but the film should have implied some self-awareness.",imqf5b
g4bz3nf,"Excellent point there! It was interesting viewing the film as both relating immensely to Jake but also taking a more analytical and detached approach to it as well, varying between these two ways of viewing it. 

Also, on a side note about that scene: I'm a photographer and her showing the parents the paintings was agonizing relatable in its every detail, for moments when I've shown my work to people that are disinterested and fail to connect to it.",imqf5b

g4ah1qc,"I remember feeling waves of nausea when I got to that part... so upsetting but like you said, VERY effective",imqf5b
g461wsw,"Well the book hints that the janitor is in fact Jake’s brother before you come to the realization  that they’re all one. The general uneasiness of the vibe during the visit to the parents hints that something sinister could happen. The locked and scratched up basement. It’s not an overt sense of “the parents are going to kill them”, but rather that there is more than meets the eye and they could present danger",imqf5b
g4cq580,Wow. You're right. Those character omissions profoundly impact this film's direction.,imqf5b
g4bc2bg,">Jake doesn’t know women beyond seeing them in specific roles so he’s amalgamated her into a waitress in his head

g46u0my,"I know. It was very early in the movie it seems her name is Lucy, and then not until the house did the closed captions say “young woman”, I think even after she’s gotten a call from herself. I think one of the first signs of something being wrong.",imqf5b
g44hi37,I felt like they cut off the brother part because Kauffman thought it was a waste of time and the movie was already long as it is,imqf5b
g46d6dc,"I haven't read that review either but that's exactly what I thought too! Buckley shifting into a trans-atlantic accent and smoking a cigarette out of nowhere just screamed ""stereotypical aloof film critic"" and it sounded exactly like Kael's writing. You see a Kael book in his childhood bedroom too.

I absolutely loved that conversation because Jake struggles to articulate exactly why he likes the movie, clearly having some vague idea but awkwardly expressing it as if he only understands the movie on a surface level. And he projects Kael (or a Kael figure at least) onto Buckley as his idea of someone who effortlessly knows more about his hobby than he does.   


As a film fan with anxiety that was so reminiscent of that little voice I have at the back of my head that says ""do I really know what I'm talking about? Am I full of shit?"", a voice I'm sure many fans of different kinds of art experience from time to time. Which ties right into his life regrets, as if he's rationalizing not following that passion because he was just an amateur anyway?

If so could this be part of the explanation for why there is scratches on the basement door and residue from tape that can be heard sticking when she opens it? Did he attempt to close it off? He tell her that “he’s hiding down there” talking about his true identity. It just makes me wonder about the state of the door more.",imqf5b
g842r5h,"> This might be why she sees so many cups in the school's trash bin. The cups from her iteration of the fantasy are only the latest to have been thrown away.

Films like this just take over me for the runtime man.
They achieve a waking dream state which I'm happy to sit in and experience. Seriously I grinned throughout this as it's a such a rare experience in the scheme of things. I didn't *love* the ending but that dance sequence was pure cinema.

The sequences in the childhood home hit the absurdist tone I crave so much.

You’re right. I guess I just don’t agree. If it was a good movie, would you have the same complaint? If it was about a woman would you have a similar complaint? My point is I don’t think him being white or a man had anything to do with it being bad I guess, imo.",imqf5b

gpavkkh,"Yeah so the author was a coproducer of the movie, and indeed the very title of the book/film: ""I'm thinking of ending things"" has the double meaning of breaking off the relationship / committing suicide which you're supposed to realize at the end. A lot of the structure of the book was probably just hard to convey visually, so the director took a more visual approach",imqf5b
i45d4h7,">He lives in his parents' old house and is mostly isolated from people. At work (the school) he's mostly nonverbal, but writes about this idealized relationship that never happened, trying to decide if things could have ended differently. But he ultimately decides that she would have eventually ""ended things"" with him (broken up with him) so he decides to end things for himself.

Apparently Kaufman took liberties with the original book (I read in an interview). So while the book could offer some guidance, I don't think it reflects the film in its totality.",imqf5b
g5vgmoi,LOL,imqf5b
g47rcon,"> Care to share? The guy ain't even the protagonist. There's no reason to think it's a fantasy of his. There's no reason to think that the events didn't play out as shown. If the film had followed him instead of her then I could see your point. But it doesn't.

When the woman goes down into the basement she goes into the washing machine and pulls out an RHS janitor's uniform. The same uniform the janitor wears. When the woman gets a call from ""herself"" on the phone the voice on the other end is the janitors, who is seen in the first scene of the movie muttering the same sort of lines, which the woman hears even though he's behind a pane of glass and easily 30 feet away. The mother mentions Jake's 50th birthday party and later we see Jake's hands and they are the hands of a much older man. The janitor is mocked by the two pretty young girls in the highschool and then the same girls are at the ice cream place, mocking Jake the same way. Jake talks about how ""they"" regularly put on a production of Oklahoma and we also see the janitor watching as the highschool kids put on a production of Oklahoma. Jake in his final scene is performing in the same auditorium where the janitor was mopping up in the scene where he watched the Oklahoma rehearsal. We see the janitor watching the Robert Zemeckis film about the vegan waitress and then we cut back to the dream world and suddenly the main woman is being described as a waitress and Jake says they met when he ordered the ""Santa Fe Burger,"" the same burger that was being discussed in the movie. 

I'm sure there's more I'm thinking of. Many of Jake's stranger lines only make sense if you understand he's the janitor. The hints start out subtle but by the end I thought it was kind of obvious.",imqf5b
g51ropt,Jesus that scene where she attacks the movie for 5 minutes straight made me wanna blow my brains out,imqf5b
g53mqkx,"I loved and hated what the director was trying to do. I agree that after reading about the book, the movie becomes much more intriguing.

“Anything an environment makes you feel is about you.” 
The movie talks about art being what each viewer brings to it. Jakes father can’t understand art that doesn’t tell him how to feel. Young woman asks him to think of himself in the shoes of person it’s perspective is from. He says  he can’t unless he can see himself in them. I guess I just see myself in jake so it’s was easy for me to see what the film had to offer.",imqf5b

g47b03e,"Thanks for the review! Great stuff. I completely agree with you about Black Mirror. I feel like we’re in an over saturated  age of twists at the emd of stories, to the point where it might be better to avoid them. I think that’s what Kaufman was trying with his adaptation.

I haven’t read either. I wad trying to decide whether  I should read Foe or Things and was leaning toward Foe simply because I’d already gotten the story from the movie. But thanks to you’re suggestion I’ll pick up Things.

Partly because we might have similar tastes. I devoured the Southern Reach Trilogy and I’ve been meaning to read Three Body Problem. If you liked Annihilation I’d recommend reading Control sooner rather than later. The third book is also good but I consider it to be the weakest in the trilogy, but I had to find out how the story ended.",imqf5b
g59q7wp,"Yeah i guess this is where we are heading into subjective territory because we found it very entertaining throughout and were engaged by the sudden changes and wtf moments, it pulled us in closer as viewers... and we actually referenced david lynch when discussing the movie, that it was like a fun lynchian-puzzle like film where you had to pay attention to everything and it was nice that the answers aren't necessarily laid out for the viewer and you might catch something on a rewatch that you missed on your first viewing.. so I'm actually surprised that anyone who enjoyed mulholland drive would be put off by a movie that demanded an equal amount of attention and curiosity of what was what. you'll likely say no to a rewatch, but i'm actually enjoying the movie even moreso the second time around because i'm picking up on things i overlooked or missed the first time around. There are lots of movies where a second watch increases your appreciation in it, it's not the first movie to do that. Lynch's movies are no strangers to that model.",imqf5b
g44tygi,You're the one projecting. Big time.,imqf5b
g436ohl,"Lol, nah, I loved it, but nice try.

Your original comment is literally textbook projection. I don't deny that some people fake their taste to look smarter, but that's irrelevant because your original comment isn't accusing anybody in particular of doing that based on *their* behaviour or expression of opinion. It's accusing, generally, people who like a particular thing of doing that based on *your* perceived merits of that thing, regardless of who the people are who say they like it and what their reasons might be. That is you projecting your experience and opinion of this movie onto others, plain and simple.",imqf5b

g4a6r5z,Oooh i like that! That’s extremely interesting.,imqf5b
g46mqyy,"It is very vague! But also each of the scenes were intentional to the point where I thought I got the ""message"" of the film. It's very obvious that the boyfriend's parents embody the dread a younger individual might feel about aging, and I also think (metaphorically) that the stopping of the car at the high-school shows that there is nowhere else for the relationship to go, and also shows how difficult breaking up with someone is, precisely because it goes against depictions of romance in popular media. It also shows how much more difficult breaking up with someone gets as you get older.",imqf5b
g46n59c,"I think the scene with the two dancers in the high school are particularly on-the-nose - the scene embodies what an ideal relationship between the main female/male lead could have looked like, portrayed by popular media.

But then the love dies (stabbed by an agent in a uniform), and the actual female/male leads are forced to recognize the death of their love, in the middle of the auditorium. The fall-out of their love (see what I did there? It's not snow, but radioactive fallout :)) is palpable, and they must now recognize it.",imqf5b

g4gv4c7,"Thanks!!

I spent a lot of time thinking about this after watching it. In the end, though I enjoyed the in-depth analysis it led me to, I feel that a more cathartic ending was needed. Movies that live in their own metaphors without attempting to resolve or make sense of their surface level stories (e.g. mother!) can be frustrating. This was well-made, but I think Jessie Buckley's character needed a better ending than essentially reverting into what the janitor feels she thinks of his younger self (describing him as a creeper that wouldn't stop staring at him or equating him to a mosquito that bit her 40 years ago. It's entirely possible that she might have actually liked him, but he dislikes himself so deeply, that he seeks out to punish himself (reading deep scathing criticism of the things he likes and putting those opinions into his partners in his fantasies). Sometimes, Charlie Kaufman is a bit TOO depressing for his own good. The films that he directs always end up being so deeply sad. His written projects often have a more positive note to them (which may be placed there by directors who rightfully think it's needed), like the leads in Eternal Sunshine deciding that they are happy to endure the bad times in their relationship and let it end in tragedy, if they are able to experience the good (the ending could have been much more depressing here, with almost no change to the script at all).",imqf5b
g4f5u5o,"I dont remember how the scene goes but it’s like they were discussing about how we are conditioned to have our identity on the movies we watch, like pop culture changing us into them.

g4fhtky,"I would agree with you, but it’s definitely the sound of an engine cluttering on ignition from the being in the cold all night.

So it’s very common to like a movie, then Kael convinces you you’re wrong.

Even if the literary references were over people's heads, I still think Kaufman provides enough to make  it obvious.

Jake is a sad old man who puts too much value on shitty tid-bits, and he is trying to showcase that through her to see if that would make her any better.  It is colored by previous arguments of whether or not she has autonomy, even as a figment of his imagination.  It makes fun of overt critical analysis and completely satirizes our modern way of analyzing films, and once I'm done seeing all that, I admire the performance for being so good.   Questions about reality and the nature of experience being presented specifically within someone's imagination while his own character is trying to fight back in subtle ways all while he makes the character recite a grating critic review is a brilliant thing to watch unfold, and I personally loved it for that.

So much of this film is awesome because it’s clear that he loves the source material but is transforming all of the events ever so slightly for the screen to convey as dreadful of a feeling for the viewer as Reid did for the reader.

g5c1gcc,"I don’t think the dance sequence has anything to do with the book and the parallel you see is coincidental or at least secondary to the much more direct comparison to the musical Oklahoma, which is possibly the most referenced text in the movie.

The first act of Oklahoma ends with the main character having a laudanum-induced hallucination, which the audience sees as a “dream ballet.” The dance in the movie is literally exactly a 1:1 recreation the dream ballet from Oklahoma, where the main woman character and the main hero character dance together in love until the main antagonist interrupts and stabs the hero.

There is extra resonance in the use in the film though because in the musical, the “bad guy” (Jud) in Oklahoma who kills the “good guy” (Curly) is also a “dreamer” who keeps saying he’s going to get his life together and get the the girl and achieve his dreams—but then he does nothing. In the film, the young Jake represents the hero Curly-archetype who is successful, while the janitor represents the Jud-archetype who is just a fake dreamer with no real future.

Also, in Oklahoma, Jud later kills himself on accident when he falls on his own knife after picking a fight with Curly. That’s sort of what happens to the janitor getting hypothermia.",imqf5b

Jake is the protagonist, but the ""voice"" guiding you through the film is Lucy's.

Clearly he reads quite a bit, but he lacks the real-world understanding that comes with any of those professions. 

His relationship with the girl works in the same way. She’s everything he romanticizes about relationships, but she lacks the nuance of being a real human being. She’s all surface level smarts and arts in order to satisfy what he wants. Of course that’s not how real relationships work, but that’s not something that a lonely old midwestern janitor can comprehend because he lacks the real-world experience.

This indicates that the bf and the janitor are the same guy but nothing more than that.

> When the woman gets a call from ""herself"" on the phone the voice on the other end is the janitors, who is seen in the first scene of the movie muttering the same sort of lines, which the woman hears even though he's behind a pane of glass and easily 30 feet away.

I guess I must have missed that. I don't recall them sounding the same. Could easily be her hallucination though.

> The mother mentions Jake's 50th birthday party and later we see Jake's hands and they are the hands of a much older man.

There are a lot of possible explanations for this, especially given the time fuckery we see in the movie. The mom is also a bit unhinged.

> The janitor is mocked by the two pretty young girls in the highschool and then the same girls are at the ice cream place, mocking Jake the same way.

Yes, this just indicates it's the same scenario, same people, etc. Not that ""the whole thing is a dream/fantasy"". In fact this is evidence *against* it being a fantasy. What sort of fantasy has people mocking you? (Edit: There's also the fact that the lead girl sees the thrown away cups in the dumpster and there's a lot, indicating a time loop scenario)

> Jake talks about how ""they"" regularly put on a production of Oklahoma and we also see the janitor watching as the highschool kids put on a production of Oklahoma.

This again indicates jake is a janitor, but nothing further.

> Jake in his final scene is performing in the same auditorium where the janitor was mopping up in the scene where he watched the Oklahoma rehearsal.

Again that just indicates it's the same school and he is the same person yes.

> We see the janitor watching the Robert Zemeckis film about the vegan waitress and then we cut back to the dream world and suddenly the main woman is being described as a waitress and Jake says they met when he ordered the ""Santa Fe Burger,"" the same burger that was being discussed in the movie.

Yup. But keep in mind we're following the girl, not the guy. So this would be *her* distorted perception. It's clear she is confused about her past.

> I'm sure there's more I'm thinking of.

None of the things you mentioned explicitly state or imply that it's a dream or fantasy; and several imply the exact opposite. They are definitely strange, and give the implication that something isn't right; but it's not clear *what* isn't right. We can see the girl appearing in various points of time, along with her disturbed sensory experiences, which indicates that she's ill in some way; especially when we start seeing ""looping"" events. Implies some mix of hallucinations, memory loss, etc. Jake on the other hand is clearly competent and a part of the world that she has distorted perceptions about. There's no reason to think there's anything wrong with his perceptions, memory, etc. The only time I can think of something being off there would be when he identifies her photo as himself and perhaps his anxiety and depression that he indicates during one of the car rides and the stop at the dq.

> Many of Jake's stranger lines only make sense if you understand he's the janitor.

Yes, there's no doubt that he's the janitor. We see jake at various points in his life, just as we see his parents at various points in their life. The only person this doesn't happen to is the protagonist. Implying she's separate or distinct from the surrounding scenery. If the entire thing was a fantasy of *his* then *she* would also be a part of that scenery, but she isn't.

> The hints start out subtle but by the end I thought it was kind of obvious.

That jake is the janitor? Yes that's very obvious even close to the beginning. But it's not clear at all that the entire series of events is supposedly a dream or fantasy. That makes no sense and doesn't line up with what we see. The tone doesn't match either. The whole movie is horribly awkward, depressing, and drawn out. almost agonizingly so. If he was fantasizing about a better life it'd be uplifting, happy, etc. and have a sharp twist to reveal the reality of the situation (bleak). Instead it's the opposite: dreary through the whole thing until the end, where the future him kills his present self and past self, stranding the girl in the high school.

I agree the ending is a bit of a mess. I read the synopsis of the book which apparently makes it *much more clear* that indeed it's a fantasy/dream, and that she isn't real. But apparently the book indicates that quite heavily; whereas the movie it's entirely absent.

the only part that stood out as poorly made was the jarring cut between young jake and older jake. Young jake just kinda vanished and the perspective shifted from the girl to the janitor. It felt pretty unfinished, and I found myself wondering where the ending of the film was. Perhaps the acted out murder was meant to be taken literally? The janitor killing his past self, as well as the girl?

I was also waiting for a scene where she attempts to repeatedly call herself, which we saw earlier in the film. But that never happened so it felt a bit incomplete there.",imqf5b
g51wsj0,"I feel ya- but actually, I thought that scene was brilliant. 

When she's delivering that speech, she slips into a transatlantic accent. That's an accent that isn't actually ""real"" but was used by actors of that era, because it sounds classy af. Watch any Katherine Hepburn scene and you'll see it immediately.

It's multilayered because not only is she embodying his fantasy at that moment, but she's also talking about how that actresses' portrayal was so nuanced that it didn't register as the amazing performance it was. Because it was so much at once.

As for how well the film portrays certain things, that's very debatable. Kaufman's writing is a lot of the times a crutch that disconnects one from the reailty of the film, making it all seem rather insignificant and frustrating more than rewarding. Since everything's a metaphor anyway, there's hardly a reason to care, and since the film is so concerned with its own puzzle (to the detriment of emotion or pathos or theme) it becomes even harder to care about anything it has to say, because it chooses to say it so poorly. Comparing it to other metaphorical, even abstract pictures, like say Persona or Close-Up, films that are experimental but only to tell their stories betters, and to involve the audience in their realities, do all of this much better. In comparison, this film is a boring, plodding film, that only hints at what it could be saying, instead of actually saying it.",imqf5b

That’s the main support for my theory. 

Then I thought maybe the girl at the ice cream store, who’s theme seems to be the shame of being “ugly” (in her point of view) vs other girls, could be a manifestation of his own thoughts of himself as a woman.

g44seto,"Yeah, I think it almost demands to be re watched with how much is going on in it.  There were so many little subtleties that I picked up on my first watch that I'm 100% positive that I missed a lot more.  While not a traditional horror film, I still found it deeply unsettling and existentially terrifying.  I mean, the ideas about time, loss, and dying alone made for some uncomfortable thoughts that can be scarier than most horror movies.  I thought it had that in common with the Lighthouse.  They're both movies that stick with you after the credits.",imqf5b
g47q3ip,Apparently this type of movie is considered a psychological drama but I’d personally consider it a horror. This is one of a handful of movies that have ever unnerved me this way.,imqf5b

g459ikw,"Agree with everything you said here. Funny enough I was super curious as to how the first 3/4s of the book would be able to be translated on to the screen, and he completed nailed it. I figured the ending was the most straightforward part, and that’s where it goes off the rails haha",imqf5b

g453lm2,"I interpreted that as being a dying flight of fancy. As his brain shut down while freezing to death, he remembered the ice cream jingle, the dying pig, the school, Oklahoma, and the end speech from A Beautiful Mind (one of the movies on the shelf in Jake's room).",imqf5b

I loved the way it was filmed and how creepy it was, but it makes it makes it apparent too early imo that things aren't what they seem.

g43atrk,"Well the book is far from a horror story. It’s creepy, has this sense of dread and some really creepy scenes but I would never think an adaptation would be anything truly scary.",imqf5b
g45ce6p,Essentially the movie is the same until they get into the high school. There is less parents stuff in the book though. You also don’t meet the janitor until you get to school. Jake sees him through the window in the school as him and his girlfriend are going to have sex. Jake gets pissed and goes to track him down. Basically once the girlfriend follows him into the school it becomes scary and dreadful. Because she starts to realize she is not real and she is the janitor and Jake and everyone all at once. The janitor is basically coming after she feels like. The janitor is creepy. He has a creepy closet. The girlfriend has essentially a mental breakdown and can’t perceive time and then eventually the janitor kills himself and Jake and the girlfriend all at once. I’m thinking of ending thing is the janitor contemplating suicide and not the girlfriend braking up with him.,imqf5b
g43zf2w,"I had captions on. Whenever she spoke off camera, it always said [Young Woman].",imqf5b
g4xuev8,"Come on. It's coming from the father character whose shown to have memory problems alongside being crass and ignorant is clear strawman. And of course Jake would manifest that. It's clear which side of the arguement Jake falls under and the subtext seems to suggest that he wasn't fond of his father. So his father is shown as a ignorant imbecile who ""doesn't get it""

> but the movie seems to deliberately challenge the nature of protagonists as a concept

Not really. Lucy's role is more like a standard of an observer protagonist. Basically a lens for the audience to look at the story rather than an active participant. It's not really a new concept.

Again, I understand it. I can relate to it. Just because I don't sympathize doesn't mean I don't understand. To me, everything Jake is whining about are things I got over a long time ago. He's in his twilight years, his body is breaking down, he's got mental problems and yet his mind is a teenager goaning over how life didn't give him what he thought he deserved and lamenting opportunities he never took. It's like a toddler having a tantrum, it doesn't make me sympathize but rather makes me want to slap him and tell him to grow up.",imqf5b
g4eha5l,Apparently in the audiobook version the narrator’s voice switches from female to male during the part.,imqf5b
g4304zm,"Oh shit... I just finished the movie about half an hour ago and while I pretty much understood the basic concept, I was confused by most of what happened lol. I’m understanding more and more the longer I think about it tho.

It’s weird they didn’t incorporate that question into the film somehow.",imqf5b
g46xcbx,"I’ll have to disagree. Every character in the book is a manifestation of Jake’s personality one way or another, with the Janitor being the real worlds representation of Jake. Jake uses his brother to represent his negative qualities. The brother never actually exists. But you don’t discover that until the big reveal. I just went back to check real quick but the book definitely hints at jakes brother being the janitor, and how is brother is a potential danger. Check pages 124-126. Talks about how he stalked Jake and also had to leave his position to find another one where he didn’t have to interact with people. I’m sure there’s more examples but I don’t feel like looking for them haha",imqf5b
g46i603,"That's an excellent way of describing it!   


I had initially thought of the situation more like Jake had been afraid or anxious to take the steps to become any of those things. There's a very cutting line when his real janitor self tells Buckley the school is ""safe"", meaning he would have had to take risks to fulfill his ambitions in life but has settled for the simple security of a paycheck. And that also ties into him being afraid to ask her out when he actually met her in real life, her whole character being a projection of a missed opportunity. Which would make Jake someone who *had* potential but just never fulfilled it due to fear or anxiety or whatever you find most appropriate to describe him.  


But I like the wrinkle you brought up of Jake being more of a ""jack-of-all-trades"" wanna-be intellectual or artist, a man who never followed through on anything specific and never really had much potential in the first place. This adds an extra sting of tragedy to the character. There's even a moment when his mom describes an event in his childhood where he received a pin for his hard work and diligence rather than for any real talent or ability. This makes him even more pitiable and tragic of a character!",imqf5b

g4nhfki,"The conversations and dialog are explicit, which is what he says directly if you read the comment. Like their conversation about everything wanting to live. He finds the exclusions and asks: So not everything wants to live. Right? Another internal attempt at not feeling alone, isolated, or as ashamed as about his thoughts of suicide.
Just one of many examples of the dialog explicitly being centered on death/suicide.",imqf5b
g4741n8,"That’s really cool. Judging by your other comments in this thread you’re one of the most pretentious people I’ve seen on this sub. Take the stick out of your ass, no one cares about your references.

Don’t worry chief, I’m sure your letterboxd account will take off any day",imqf5b
g4padt3,"I’m praising the film for being able to cause those thoughts and emotions?? Lol that’s what art is meant to do? And it’s not easy for a movie to provoke very strong thoughts or emotions that aren’t just surface level, sad music, sad people, sad scene, now feel sad, tell them how to feel here or mainstream won’t get it.
Just seems like a difference in opinion. For sure this is more art than entertainment, but not all movies need to be pure entertainment to be a good film. 
I think it shows everything incredibly clearly, maybe a second viewing is required to catch it all but having a movie that rewards you for rewatching it is hardly something people interested in film get upset about. Sure it didn’t tell it in dialog but every scene was littered with details, jake being shown to replace the janitor staring out the window in the first few minutes. Like it’s not hard to follow if people werent looking at their phones at the same time when watching it they’d catch the obvious editing and clues left for us.

Edit: and I’m reveling in his portrayal of the mental illness. Sure it made me feel emotion but I didn’t cry and I wasn’t reveling in the emotion I felt, I was genuinely impressed at the metaphors they went with, the hints they chose, with the dialog they did choose because they aren’t meaningless nor hard to follow. Also I was reveling in how long it took me to have an aha! moment because I’m tired of knowing the whole movie from the trailer and I’m tired of having one specific interpretation spelt out for us. Some of us like subtlety and slow digestion. We just have different opinions and film preferences.",imqf5b

Whoops! I meant ""Authority."" I got confused because it's been a while and the main character's name is Control haha

g4ewioi,"I don’t disagree with someone viewing Kaufman’s films as pretentious but Marvel movies have absolutely no substance and are created with the primary intent of making money through ticket sales, merchandise, toys, and brand deals.

Call bullshit if you want, but I’m good friends with people who have worked on Marvel film sets and the common sentiment among the crew is “we’re just doing this for the pay”.

there’s no artistic value to any of them and you cannot convince me otherwise. popcorn flicks for kids. most people who work in the actual film industry share this sentiment.",imqf5b

g492f46,"People have interpreted the book’s ending similarly, Jake having written the book as he bleeds out from his wounds and the fantasy failing as he passes.",imqf5b
g43eaju,"I initially felt the same way. The way that the book's narrative feels super grounded aside from a few small glitches makes the ending so much more impactful. That said, I think Kaufman's choice to visibly portray the film's story as a fantasy/simulation was respectable. After all, in a film you have to show everything, so it'd be difficult to hide the true nature of what we're seeing for as long. 

Not to mention the film format provides for so many creative opportunities to play with and unsettle the viewer while teasing the truth of what we're seeing. I think Kaufman took so many of those opportunities and did it well, like the dinner scene where everyone's correcting the story teases a collective consciousness.",imqf5b
g43f2yl,"I read the book and my wife didn't. Couldn't agree more with what you said and I felt the same way in regards to her experience. I was a little disappointed that the weirdness was very blatant in the movie, where as in the book it was subtle.",imqf5b

g4beupv,"I don't think it makes anything clear at all, the whole film the viewer is wondering what is going on. If everything seemed normal and then it all went crazy I wouldn't like that, it's too much like, 'it was all a dream'.

I love that a film like this gets made, but it was a little too opaque and difficult to piece together and the ending could have made things a bit clearer. A dance and a song and a truck in a snowdrift, like that's a pretty weak ending.",imqf5b
g43dsnw,"I think the climax of the book is decidedly horror-thriller. It really seemed like the film was going to go in the same direction, particularly when we see the quick cut to the janitor ""peeping"".",imqf5b

g431hf5,Yeah overall the book is much more straightforward about what happened. I would have been pretty damn confused/frustrated with the movie if I hadn’t read the book first.,imqf5b
g47e1lo,There isn’t. I reread the book yesterday after watching the film. Just because it says those things doesn’t mean it points to the janitor. You’ve seemed to interpret it that way and that’s fine but in no way does it ever push you to think his brother is the janitor. The book pretty much drops him then and there and is never much of a presence even when they get to the school. Jake would have said something about him working there and if somehow it was his brother it would be absolutely out of left field. Jake stumbles upon his old school where his brother works but jake doesn’t seem to know that and then jakes brother hunts him and his girlfriend. Honestly it’s just stupid because there just isn’t nearly enough info about his brother leading up to it for it to make any sense at all.,imqf5b

g56mnij,Opinions are only as strong as the analysis behind them.,imqf5b
g4du03b,"I suppose. Mostly, I was expecting psychological thriller and got broadway musical instead lol... I mean, the book is arguably better than the movie in most cases. It’s no easy task to cram hours of book into a two hour movie. I tried to keep that in mind going in. I may be biased but I felt like the extras (references and added social commentary) took away from precious time that could have been used towards real character development and storytelling. There was never any real struggle in the reveal - but I guess that was all supposed to be expressed through the song and dance? Lol 🤷‍♀️

When the dancer tapped his foot as he closed the locker door, I could feel the pain of the janitors loneliness set in. With each slam, signifying the end of a fantasy of what could have been. First the girl. Then his younger idealized self. Never to fully realize his true potential or experience the love and connection he desperately longed for. Just a sad old man. Alone. Vulnerable. Happy endings are just a facade. Like the one in this other movie you may have seen where the guy also goes crazy. And also this obscure song from an old musical, because it’s also kind of similar. Follow your guts. Figuratively and literally naked. Forever.",imqf5b

g4krk5t,I definitely could be giving them too much credit.  I do whoever feel that this movie has alot of long dialogue heavy scenes  that are a bit over tedious by design to push the viewer to become more of an active role in the movie.

Somewhere between this movie and only having the capacity to enjoy a straightforward marvel-esque movie. Although I'll admit I'm just arguing semantics here.,imqf5b

Then I imagine that he never actually left his truck (since after the credits it shows his truck covered in snow) and when he ‘walks back into the school naked’ that’s just him passing on into death.",imqf5b

He had to leave his work... anything to do with interacting with coworkers, was too hard on him... had to find a new job... where he could blend into the walls” - which is very similar to what she overheard his parents say earlier about him leaving the lab because he was too shy, ect.

Then around page 157, while she waits for Jake outside of the school, she talks about the janitor. Paralleling a lot of what he said about his brother “...Even if there were people around, no one would notice the custodian” 

The brother is brought up again when she is in the gym locker room around page 200. She realizes Jake is the man, the custodian. Then she immediately thinks about the brother and says he made it all up - jake is the crazy one. There is no brother. 

So if Jake is the janitor... and the brother is really Jake... then the “brother” must also be the janitor.",imqf5b

g4yb9gn,I don't think it's asking you to sympathise with him at all. Why would Kaufman go so far out of his way to emphasise how pathetic he is if that was the goal?

Nearly all of his protagonists are pathetic in one way or more and they very rarely learn their lesson by the end.,imqf5b
