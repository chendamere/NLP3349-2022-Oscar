eop085z,"That trio of the karaoke, pool scene, and the immediate aftermath scene was absolutely amazing. 

Worth the price of admission alone for me. 

The slow build of confidence for Amy, followed by the euphoric rush of going into the pool that felt like it was going to be the climax followed by the immediate crushing blow. And then the scene under water mirroring the previous show but this time completely crushed. The single take walk through the house followed by one of the best shot arguments I've seen in a long time. 

Wow, Olivia Wilde is gonna do amazing things.",bs6w7x
eottmek,"I think my favorite thing about this movie is how kind it feels.

That may seem like a weird term to use, but what I mean is that all of the characters are written and portrayed with so much empathy. There are no stereotypical bully characters or mean girls or dumb jocks; even those who seem like assholes early on prove to be three-dimensional, and just because certain characters do or say hurtful things at one time doesn‚Äôt make them inherently mean. Like that one kid who was talking shit about Molly in the bathroom, but then at the party he was leading her and Amy around and telling them he‚Äôd miss them.

As another example, I thought the scene between Amy and Hope was really sweet and when it ended really poorly, I was really sad. But then Hope was shown to still be into Amy, and her anger at the time was just an in-the-moment reaction.",bs6w7x

What an absolutely stunning cast, Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein had phenomenal chemistry with each other. Even minor characters like Gigi left a great impression.

eol4y2u,"I saw this last week actually. My wife pointed out that she has never heard me laugh that loud in a theater before. I'm a hard sell when it comes to comedies, and this one had something funny almost constantly.

And more importantly for me at least, it was almost devoid of cliches. I liked the movie, but when they got to the party I thought ""Oh great, now the popular kids are going to be mean to them and they'll both be embarrassed and blah blah blah."" BUT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. It was so great to just have the climax of the story revolve around how even if things go right, they might not meet your exact specifications.

There‚Äôs a lot of things to love about this movie, especially the way it portrays teenage culture, but to mention the thing that really stuck out to me: the tropes that it subverts and the very unique and real character problems that are presented. Like, Annabelle talking about how she‚Äôs accepted that the boys are going to call her hurtful nicknames, but it‚Äôs the *girls* doing it that guts her ‚Äî that hit with me. Also, seeing a school genius get confronted about assuming that people who focused on other things were automatically not doing anything with their lives was great because I‚Äôve never really seen it be flipped on them like that. Super good!",bs6w7x

eokyjhc,I thought it was brilliant. Wilde can and will only get better. Billie Lourd was hilarious.,bs6w7x
eokyl9q,"This was a really fun time, smile plastered on my face throughout.

Loved the soundtrack choices and the supporting cast was great in bit pieces (Kudrow, Forte, Sudeikis, Williams, etc). Kaitlyn Dever & Beanie Feldstein were *perfect* for the roles and it's legitimately touching in parts. It does suffer a bit from 'unrealistic high school syndrome' where you can tell it's not anywhere near real life but it worked most of the time because it never took itself *too* seriously during those scenes (reccess/lunch scene, hallway scene(s), etc). The girl that kept popping up was hilarious, especially when she randomly becomes a piano maestro at the end. That bit could've backfired and gotten old really quickly but it was good. Didn't even know it was Billie Lourd until I looked it up after watching.

I saw the 'twist' coming from a mile away but it was well done with the pool scene. The 'argument/fight' scene was suuuuuuper well-acted and shot. Dever in particular killed it during that scene, really hit me when she looked over at the crowd filming and the argument became muted and the music kicked in. My favorite two scenes were when they compliment each other's outfits, they played so well off of each other and these were the 2 funniest scenes.

I also loved how right off they bat Wilde does something unexpected when Beanie overhears the 3 people talking shit and you think ""oh she's just gonna brag and unrealisticly win the argument and walk out"" like most other generic high school movies, but nope, she gets instantly *destroyed* and shot down lol. Same thing at the airport, you think you're gonna get another Lady Bird airport-emotional-goodbye-scene but nahhh, let's get some fucking pancakes.

+1 for Rhye's Open on the soundtrack. That song never fails to make me want to curl up and cry like a baby. Used well in this.

I loved Beanie's ""Hey uhh Quick Q"" lines. Reminded me of ""Gucci! üëå"" from Eighth Grade last year. Could see myself quoting that.

Not sure about the acid trip/doll scene though. Felt out of place and could've done without that. Points for originality though. 

I feel like this is one of those movies that would be a lot better without seeing the trailers though. Alottttttttttt of the punchlines were given away and I hate that. Like the cop-car shotgun line would've killed me if I hadn't already seen/heard it 5000 times in trailers. There were some others like that too. Not a big complaint.

Solid 8/10, best comedy of the year so far. Top-tier coming-of-age movie. Probably will be my first re-watch of the year.",bs6w7x

eol02ae,"I‚Äôll be pretty honest, I was very meh about this movie for the whole first act. There were a lot of names, faces and traits to keep up with. And the majority of the characters had one defining trait for the whole first act. I was getting worried this wouldn‚Äôt be the movie I expected.


But I have to say, the turning point was definitely the sound of scissoring in Jason Sudeikis‚Äô car. Even the less riotous jokes that I didn‚Äôt really care for in the beginning started to charm me (I cackled at how these two friends have a thing about Malala). Finally, those defining traits for all the side characters either got turned up all the way (the gay kids‚Äô theme party, the wayback boy getting with the teacher) or were presented as being just one part of their personality (George, Triple A)

The high school definitely felt lived in towards the end, and I can say that‚Äôll probably give this movie a good rewatch value in the future. I‚Äôd give it a solid 8/10.",bs6w7x

eokyyqg,"I absolutely loved this movie and think it's one of the best comedies I've seen in years. It's crazy how this was kinda promoted as ""female Superbad"" and how eerily similar it is plotwise: 

two best friends who do everything together but don't get along with everyone else in their school decide to go to a party to win over their crushes at the end of the senior year of school and go to other parties and get in trouble along the way, they have a big falling out over not telling each other what's going on next year as they go different ways but then reunite at the end, blah blah blah

but despite hitting so many of the same plot beats, this movie felt so fresh and so different and was so funny. both lead actresses were amazing, billie lourd is one of the most underrated actress right now and is hilarious, and all the supporting cast did a great job.

I hope that Dever and Feldstein continue to get starring roles and that this movie is successful because it really was an extremely fun watch",bs6w7x

eq90tkq,"So I didn't wanna see this movie like at all, I thought it looked like shit and the trailer was obnoxious and I didn't wanna see it. I was basically doing a triple feature because I had some time to kill, and I was seeing Brightburn (it sucked), Poms (MEGA sucked) and this all in the same night. And then I saw it and about 12 hours later I went back and saw it again. I cannot stress enough how fucking good this movie is. If anyone reading this thread who hasn't seen the film is on the fence, please just go watch it it's so good, and anyone in this thread who hated it, I respect your opinion and I love you unconditionally but please get your brain checked because it's running on pure comic sans text font. The fact that this is a directorial debut is mind boggling because it feels like a film made by a professional filmmaker. Obviously a lot of comparisons can be drawn to Superbad with it's incredible portrayal of teenage life, perfect implementation of vintage set pieces and objects and really solid script, but just as many comparisons can be drawn with Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World with it's quick and snappy editing, incredibly cinematography and excellent knowledge of the comedy format.

But I‚Äôm real life you may be interested in someone but they may not like you back and that doesn‚Äôt make them evil. This film was super refreshing.

Also, the pool scene is beautifully shot and the soundtrack is excellent.

1) I found Molly to be a relatively unlikable protagonist, she was selfish, controlling, stuck-up, I felt a little sympathy when she was in the bathroom overhearing the gossip about her, but once the meltdown happened I was pretty much over with her character. 

2) I 110% ship Amy with Gigi over the girl they put her with. They seemed like they had better chemistry and I loved Gigi's character and craziness throughout the movie.",bs6w7x
eopu5vq,"I liked it. Didn't love it but yeah I didn't regret seeing it. Cute flick about mostly platonic love between two young women, which is not shown enough in film IMO.
Glaring thoughts:

-amazing soundtrack, wow. Fucking death grips lol

-great synergy between the two MCs

-Ryan being straight was a huge surprise

And lastly, the one I haven't seen ANYONE mention:

-WHAT WAS THE NEED FOR THE TEACHER-FUCKS-STUDENT SUBPLOT!!??? imo for a movie with otherwise pretty wholesome motives and ideals that was a really pointless plot device that didn't move anything anywhere. Totally left a gross taste in my mouth.",bs6w7x
es8ulmm,"This movie really is in my top 3 for this year so far.

The story, acting and all of that was great but you can read that in all the other reviews. Yes it's a great comedy with all kinds of comedy. The dance in the opening is really cute, It's cringy as hell with Jared and It's absurd with Gigi and all the jokes land.

&#x200B;

But what I really enjoyed is how it stepped away from usual tropes and this is the  most noticeable in the character of Amy played Kaitlyn Dever. This isn't a coming of age story where they are searching for who they are because Amy already knows who she is. She knows she is into girls. Also Molly knows about it so it so it is not a secret. Normally they feel it in inside but don't express it and i liked this.

&#x200B;

Then you have the party where they get with the people they want to be with. Molly gets with Nick and Amy gets with Ryan. So you think about that sweet ending but then Ryan and Nick get together. That flipped what you expected in a surprising way upside down.

What‚Äôd you guys think about the bathroom scene with Amy and Hope? I‚Äôm obsessed with Amy‚Äôs character (and this movie by the way), I think she‚Äôs the cutest and her development is amazing to watch. But there wasn‚Äôt any foreshadowing of Amy and Hope having any interest besides a super quick encounter at school in the very beginning. 

Do you think that it was out of character for Amy to kiss Hope as they were bickering about hating each other? I feel like the ‚Äúgay people kissing each other out of pent up rage‚Äù trope is overdone in movies, but for some reason it seemed ok here ‚Äî I just don‚Äôt know if it was consistent with Amy‚Äôs character.

The humor didn't always land with me though, there were some funny moments here and there but there were other where it seemed they were trying too hard. Olivia Wilde does a very good job with her debut. That being said, while everyone keeps showering the film with praise for me it kind of feels hollow by the end. People keep going on about how great it is that every character is ""multi-faceted"", but I don't think that's accurate, I'd say mostly they have two facets: one likeable, one despicbale; depending on the scene a character shows one of these two (and that applies only for the students, the adults are very one-dimensional if you ask me, though I guess that gets a pass since its told from the perspective of two teenagers). By the end, everyone just goes around telling people that they actually aren't as bad as one may think, which comes across really fake imo. Anyway, I'm pretty sure this film will keep getting praise, will probably be nominated for some awards at the beginning of next year (might even win some) and will become an important teen comedy for today's generation.",bs6w7x

Before this movie I really had no opinion of Olivia Wilde. Now I know she's a fantastic director. I hope she does more awesome comedies in the future.

Highlight for me of this film is the soundtrack. It worked so well for what I felt like were all of the scenes! Also I‚Äôm digging that Slip Away by Perfume Genius may be becoming the go-to song to use in coming of age movies. 1st Eighth Grade and now Booksmart. 


Another thing I really dug were the two unapologetically & flamboyantly gay theatre students holy shit they were so funny and it‚Äôs insane how accurate they are down to the YAAAAS‚Äôs and over-enthusiasm for their plays and dramas. If y‚Äôall ever seen or participated in a high school theatre then you know for sure there are at least 1 or 2 crew members who are exact replicas of those two characters.

eqip209,Saw this last Friday and it blew me away. Definitely one of my favourite films this year that I'll definitely be watching again soon. None only was it great but it's given me a burst of life and motivation I so badly needed. Amazing film at the perfect time in my life as I'm almost done with school and going to uni this year too,bs6w7x
etivi0k,"Damn, reading all these comments make's me feel like I didn't watch this movie properly. Thought it was really great and funny, but not as incredibly hilarious as everyone's been making it out to be. Maybe I should give it another watch.",bs6w7x
eonlge5,The pool scene is one of my favorite scenes of the year so far. Hilarious and wonderful direction (also a sick soundtrack!) great movie.,bs6w7x

eqgozu7,"Loved this movie. Bought tickets for it on a whim, and didn't have high expectations for it... boy was I in for a surprise. The first 10 minutes passed and I was genuinely surprised at myself for laughing as much as I was. I thought the movie was lighthearted and fun until the drug scene. Then it was taken to the next level. The pool scene and subsequent argument scene were awesome. The characters felt three-dimensional and relatable, even characters on the side. It was progressive but not forced, hilarious, and slightly chaotic (in a good way). Needless to say, I saw it again a few days later. If you haven't seen it yet, you must (ESPECIALLY if you are Gen Z). The acting, writing, and cinematography are all top-tier, and it's definitely one of the best movies of the year.",bs6w7x

It's my favorite of 2019 so far.,bs6w7x

Interesting that the kids were so ... *kind* to each other, in general. It felt like all of them had been through years of cognitive behavioral therapy. Even when they were mean, they were insightful about it. If that's how kids really are, maybe there's some hope.",bs6w7x

f2vgbwp,"Maybe it was overhyped for me, but I found Booksmart to be a bit of a letdown. Enjoyable all the way through, well acted, really liked the music choices, but as the film ended it felt kind of... pointless and its message was completely muddled for me. Few of their big problems felt relatable (*other* people also got into Ivy League schools? It's not six months in Botswana but *a year*?!? Oh my) For all the hype this movie got for diversity, I just saw more priveldged white kids doing their thing. Plus a lot of the humour, while funny, felt like it was below this movie (the panda, the pizza delivery guy serial killer, porn over the taxi speakers, the drug part [did they sober up quick or what?], Gigi appearing everywhere, the yacht sequence). Which sucks because nearly every dramatic scene was a home run, the actors were that good. I can't say I didn't have fun and Olivia Wilde is a great first-time director, but I think comparing this to Superbad kind of undersells both films. I left Superbad thinking it was a dumb comedy with a poignant ending. This is a poignant movie that felt the unnecessary need to be a dumb comedy.",bs6w7x
eol9jg7,"I caught an advanced screening last week. I think this will go down as one of the stronger high school comedies, both because its screenplay is truly hilarious (with some stellar performances to sell it), and because it does a nice job mixing in a meaningful message without losing any beats. It's like Eighth Grade's cruder older sister in regards to humor and youthful anxiety.

eol5nk9,"I really had a great time, I hope this makes a ton of money.

Overall I thought there was about 2 or 3 moments that really fell flat for me which keeps it from reaching that upper-echelon of comedies, but ultimately everything works so well together. Every character is believable, and have legitimately great chemistry with each other (especially the leads). The dialogue is really sharp, and well layered at times. The characters (even side ones) ultimately get rounded out really well. The soundtrack... I thought was a little much at times (another scene slowed down with rap music over it?...... ok), but it doesn't get *overly* annoying.

I was also shocked at how legitimately beautiful the movie got around the 3/4 mark. The pool scene, and the fallout from that did not need to be shot as beautifully as it was.

Stinks that it's going to get compared to Superbad so much (mostly because I don't think it hits all the same levels that Superbad does) but if that's what I'm going to have to tell people so they'll see it, I'll gladly abide.

I'd definitely go a real strong 8/10",bs6w7x

It felt like they were trying to come up with whacky scenarios (like the ones in Superbad) but they all just felt forced and unrealistic. Superbad felt like this crazy adventure whereas this just felt like a few relatively good ideas tacked together to fill time before they get to the party. I was relieved when they got to the party and the film actually got going because I was starting to cringe at the jokes bombing in my theatre.",bs6w7x
eomg2yy,"My ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ review of Booksmart on Letterboxd https://boxd.it/IDn2N

Definitely one of the better films in this R rated coming of age subgenre, mainly due to the two lead performances. Particularly Kaitlyn Dever, she has been good in lots of stuff before this but she showed tons of charisma and comedic presence. Feldstein finally didn't seem like female Jonah Hill for me, and I expect her to be getting all the comedic best friend roles for awhile. Billie Lourd is also very good, but the best in the whole cast for me is definitely Skyler Gisondo. He can make me laugh by saying basically anything, and is insanely charismatic. Now that Santa Clarita Diet is cancelled, he needs to be cast in every comedy project moving forward.

Since Booksmart will obviously be compared to Superbad, it isn't the same level for me at all; but very few comedies are. I do appreciate the added depth to the supporting characters in Booksmart though, it definitely does that better. I am not the peak target audience for this film, so if it means even half of what Superbad means to me (which I expect it to, since it's good) to some woman out there then it definitely did its job.

Edit: I would never encourage piracy but this movie is on Netflix in Pakistan already, so with how the internet works...",bs6w7x
eol3u7s,"Just saw it tonight, it is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of the year. So funny, great leads and some genuinely touching moments",bs6w7x
eowflxb,"I really enjoyed this movie. Superbad has always been my high school movie, it came out the summer before my senior year and I have more Seth and Evan in me than I like to admit. So the obvious Superbad comparisons had me a little worried that it wouldn't hold up to the comparison, but it did.

What I liked: I know this idea is being floated around a lot in here, but the whole party scene at the end is great, and the karaoke-pool-aftermath-fight sequence of scenes is a masterpiece. The Lyft sequence and the pizza delivery guy sequence were also really funny, and most of the side characters were developed well. I thought all the performances were pretty good, Beanie Feldstein being the standout. The look on her fact during the first panda scene are worth the price of admission alone.

What I didn't like: I liked Billie Lourd in this, but I thought the ""Gigi pops up everywhere bit"" didn't hit its mark. It reminded me of a joke that's funny the first time, becomes unfunny, then doubles back to being funny, but it didn't happen enough to double back so it was left in the unfunny zone. The soundtrack is getting a lot of praise, but other than ""Nobody Speak"" it didn't really do anything for me. The drugs/barbie scene also didn't really work for me. 

Overall I liked this a lot, I'd give it a 4/5 and would slide it just behind Game Night for the best comedy of the past couple years.  I liked Long Shot quite a bit but I think this is better.",bs6w7x

erm096o,"THIS MOVIE GOT ME FUCKED UP 

First off- that pool scene was incredibly done (props to Olivia Wilde), and I loved that Molly and Amy didn't end up with their initial crushes because that storyline has been done to death.

It is everything that the high school comedy genre needs, complex female characters (yadda yadda yadda),  more developed supporting characters that aren't just stereotypes, plus it's hilarious. 

I hated high school - I was a mix of Molly & smart party girls, plus a dash of Amy (but in the closet) BUT I was so insecure and judgy that I made myself miserable. (Sidenote: I also was dealing with undiagnosed dysautonomia so I felt like shit.) 

I walked out of the theater wishing I could have a high school re-do, one where I wouldn't be afraid of being myself, being out as bi, whilst not giving one FUCK what anyone thought about me. Though my outlook on life is more like that now - I'm 22, 2 years sober, still sick (bleh) - but now I wanna enjoy myself more, take risks, and break rules (besides immediately downloading the movie when I got home from the theater so I can watch the first few minutes I missed). I hope that insecure & judgy teenagers go to see this and realize that being yourself is not just an annoying cliche- it's the most fucking FREEING thing you could ever do.  

Anyway, I know what I'm talking about in therapy next week.",bs6w7x
ep75q9t,"Every time Gigi turned up I fucking lost it. With this and Long Shot the past couple of weeks have been great for comedies and while I did prefer Long Shot, this was still really fucking funny.

epe8eyz,"It is absolutely goddamn criminal this movie isn't performing well. One of the most positive, sweet, charming, but still downright filthy comedies I have seen in a very long time.

Why the fuck did they dump it in May when it would have done Gangbusters in March or August makes fuck all sense.",bs6w7x

I‚Äôm 18 and I knew way too many people similar to these characters, just of course they were a bit exaggerated but overall I loved it. Some of it was bizarre (like Billie‚Äôs character) but i felt like it worked somehow. This movie is very ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù in a sense as this is totally how teenagers talk to each other, at least in my experience.",bs6w7x
epieaqd,"It is a heart-warming film. When it comes to humour, it is clever and at times unexpected even though not all of them worked for me. I love the fact that the movie was set in one night, so you get to experience the journey with the two lead characters who are phenomenal. Kaitlyn Dever and Benie Feldstein chemistry is amazing and every dialogue flows so well especially during the scene when they throw tantrums towards each other which was taken in one long shot. I like the diverse cast in this film and all of them are good with what they offered. I find the 'Malala' part confused me because this gets glossed over despite being mentioned quite often. I also find the movie feels like a fantasy at times like Gigi who appeared out of nowhere from one party to other party. Overall, it is a well-made film and Olivia Wilde did a great job making a quotable and heart-warming teen movie that tries to battle the movie tropes and mostly succeeds. 7.5/10 for me. I highly-recommend this film. \^\^",bs6w7x

epmc72q,"This movie rocked so much. I loved it.

epskjlh,"It draws obvious comparisons to Superbad but I think it was better. Maybe not as many jokes but hits you more in the feels. The main difference is that this gives way more depth to the surrounding characters. Normally those characters are pretty 1 dimensional, and none of them really are here, which runs counter to the r/iamverysmart view of fellow high schoolers.  

If you remember the 30 Rock episode where Liz goes to her high school reunion - it reminded me of that.  And quite frankly, I bet a lot of redditors, myself included, are guilty of not giving enough credit to former classmates.

The teacher was weird and the bathroom scene felt off. But I think that's my only issue. The beginning of I Wanna Know killed me.

Olivia Wilde did an amazing job.

Sad that this doesn‚Äôt seem to be breaking out at the box office (should have been a mid/late-summer release - less blockbuster competition and I think it‚Äôd play well with its target age group when they‚Äôre getting ready to leave for college) but I think it‚Äôll be popular once it hits streaming. I liked it better than Superbad and I consider Superbad the seminal high school movie of my actual high school years, so that‚Äôs a high bar to clear.

That's not a bad thing though.  Superbad was the teen movie that defined the generation of high school-college millennials, while this is a lot more like what it would be for GenZ in 2019.

The cast had great chemistry and I really hope they continue to break out.  Dever and Gisondo have already shown their acting chops in Short Term 12 and Santa Clarita Diet respectively and I can see them among the next big name actors depending on the roles they pick.",bs6w7x

eow339q,"So many things to say about this movie.

I so relate to Molly and Amy. Overachiever, uptight and condescending A-student. I ended up in one of the best schools in my country where I realized the other students succeeded as much as I did while being good at sport/ partying 24/7 and sneaking classes. 

I liked the minor characters becoming more than a movie trope. (The popular girl and the ""roadside assistance"" origin xD ) It was amazingly realistic how the kids reacted to the two heroes coming to their parties! 

The editing was amazing. This pool scene: waaaah! And unlike many comments, the doll scene hit me so much! (especially the after scene.)

It felt like there was some depth to the characters, but there wasn't much time spent on getting to know them. I guess that was kind of the point made in the end, but like the significance of ""Malala""? just felt kind of thrown in there.  Also, seeing as partying was the build up of the story, I felt like I kept waiting for something crazy to happen and then nothing really did.  I personally thought there could have been a really funny scene made when Amy was arrested.  What even happened?  And the drug scene should have lasted much longer!  Worth seeing I think but probably not a long lasting comedy for me, which is upsetting, because I loved the leading female roles.",bs6w7x
eoppxb3,"So I thought this was just going to be a good-hearted female Superbad by way of Lady Bird, but it this got so fucking real in the second half, and it's legitimately one of the best films of the year, and one of the best teen/high school films ever. Being a gay high school student, some of these scenes just hit close, like the bathroom scene. 

It started out exactly how I expected it to go, but as the film progresses it almost reaches something transcendent. There are so many sequences of just endless beauty, from the visuals, music, characters, dialogue, and the story itself. It went in directions I was really surprised by and it was pretty moving around the end. I loved the murder mystery party, the dance number, the pool sequence, the argument scene where the dialogue just drops out and more and more people start recording it. There are so many lovely moments that's some of the best filmmaking of the year. I look forward to whatever Olivia Wilde does next, I loved this.

I thought the direction and music choices were great, but the script didn‚Äôt work for me at all. None of those people were remotely believable to me. Humor, for me, isn‚Äôt just dialing every character up to 11. It was amateur hour all over the place performance-wise outside of the main two. And so many things played for laughs didn‚Äôt make any sense, which ruins any humor for me. Why would the young, pretty black teacher have those two dresses in her car?  Ideally you design a character that is interesting enough that you can choose two weird outfits that are both funny and believable to say ‚Äúyes that lady would have those outfits.‚Äù  Not to mention why would one of them fit the chubby girl?  Billie Lourdes character was terrible imo. I don‚Äôt know, just none of it worked for me at all humor-wise.",bs6w7x

It was probably a good 30 minutes of the film and that part was a total bore fest. The only funny part was them in the backseat of the pizza delivery drivers car. Also I get that they needed to set up one event to lead to another but I thought they could have done a better job than everyone getting into prestigious colleges, including the classic lazy stoner getting a 6 figure job offer from google fresh out of high school. I thought they were just doing that to mess with her but the movie was being serious.",bs6w7x

It was amusing but felt so out of place. The running gag of Billie Lourd popping up in every party was dull and a lot of the banter between the characters was annoying. The standard third act argument was trite and the main character was irritating and snooty for most of the film. The two leads did feel like they were friends though.",bs6w7x
eoyj6ib,"Not sure what the hype is about.  Its mildly funny and it seems like ots pulling from alot of better movies (ie it even takes some things from superbad but superbad does it 100x better)

The characters besides the main 2 leads feel hollow and the writing is really awful.  Scenes are drawn out and the last half hour is just weird & contrived in its twists.  The two crushes hook up? Random mean girl is a lesbian and becomes a love interest? At least Jared felt natural (but barely had any development) and Theo hooking up with his teacher? The smart cool teacher is now trying to hang out with kids and hooking up with some kid? 

And the mike o brien pizza guy twist was sooooo random and unnecessary.  The film really did suffer from 5 screenwriters.  So many different ideas and this where Superbad also excelled.  It was truly Seth & Evan‚Äôs film.  

But idk, 98% on rt? Idk.  I should say some positive things, the acting by everyone was solid and the leads had chemistry.",bs6w7x

I‚Äôm sorry but this movie really really disappointed me.",bs6w7x
etqb013,"It had some laugh out loud moments, but overall fell flat for me.  I may have messed up by reading the reviews before hand telling audiences to ‚Äústop calling it the female Superbad, it‚Äôs better‚Äù, because I had Superbad on my mind as I watched it. With that, I kept finding how close both of these movies progressed, but lacked character development.  

I didn‚Äôt find myself attached the characters.  None of them felt relatable, which I feel is important in a coming of age film. There were scene where the main characters were relatable, but overall I did not connect.   I had no time to connect with the protagonists, though being a guy it may have been harder.  So I thought about the male characters and all of the idiotic shenanigans they were got into, but none of them were people I could care about. They were all just over the top dumb, even if they got into amazing schools.  The first positive male interaction we had, even though was very limited, was Amy‚Äôs father 1 hour and 15+ minutes into the movie.  I don‚Äôt know if the movie aimed to be progressive by flipping bad stereo types into a different gender or just didn‚Äôt invest the time into developing characters that weren‚Äôt the same gender as the main characters because that‚Äôs not the story they wanted to tell, but either way the film suffered from it. 

So at the end of it, I had seen a movie extremely similar to Superbad with characters I didn‚Äôt connect with, which I feel makes a coming of age story. Discussing with my fianc√© and her sister, Superbad had main female characters were people we found believable that they could identify in some way with.  They didn‚Äôt balance out extremes(being ridiculously dumb, but having a momentary redeeming qualitative, but were a bit nuanced.  Booksmart failed with that, leaving me with characters that had current socially popular characteristics, but were devoid of truly human elements that were believable. 

Having said all that, the movie wasn‚Äôt bad but it wasn‚Äôt very good either. I laughed out loud a couple times and there was a moment or two that gave me some new perspective, but it wasn‚Äôt enough to save the film. Though again, I admit I may have Fallen victim to comparing it to another movie, which maybe shouldn‚Äôt have happened despite how strikingly similar they were.",bs6w7x
eonheck,"While the film has its' highlights such as the chemistry between the two leads and a fun soundtrack, I feel this movie is being WAY overhyped. I guess my expectations were too high after seeing all the positive reviews (99% on RT).

I honestly didn't laugh all that much, though there were a few funny moments (Cardi B). I think this is due to some of the editing and directorial decisions that really blew past a lot of the comedic beats or held on the not so funny jokes a little too long. I felt the character development was lacking in the script and didn't feel the conflict and resolution of the two leads was earned at the end, felt more like a genre expectation.

Overall, you will have fun with it but don't expect an absolute perfect comedy like some of the reviews are saying.",bs6w7x

eowje2m,"I loved this movie! It was such a great look at female friendship and so many relatable moments throughout it. It went to places that I never thought would be touched on in a mainstream movie - like the electric toothbrush/panda situation. It‚Äôs something discussed and I feel is awkwardly relatable for many teens and it was so well done. 

I appreciated so many of the choices in the film! From the underwater scene to choosing to mute part of the fight because it didn‚Äôt really matter what was said... if you‚Äôve had a friendship like this, you‚Äôve experienced this moment. And I can‚Äôt wait to attend Shakespeare in the park...ing lot at my closest Whole Foods. 

I really loved all the characters. They felt real and they felt human. The teacher moonlighting with a side hustle, the rich but out of touch guy, the slacker who somehow is getting such a great job... I enjoyed the realness while still keeping it funny. 

The party seemed like a party that you‚Äôd actually go to/experience. It was nice to see so many relatable moments - including the karaoke room. 

This movie brought me joy and made me even more grateful for the close friends I have in my life and reminded me of our friendships. This is definitely a new guilty pleasure movie for me.",bs6w7x

Fantastic soundtrack to boot, good-ish message I guess, funnier than I thought it would be too. I liked Amy's plotline quite a bit - oddly more relatable than if she were straight. I still want to liquidate the cognitive elites, but this was a good movie nonetheless",bs6w7x

Overall, I think I was expecting more from it. The similarities to Superbad were a little too in your face at times. >!Even down to Amy throwing up on the other girl. It was almost exactly like Michael Cera's love interest throwing up on him at the party!<.

Raunchy for the sake of raunchy and woke for the sake of being woke.  I almost turned it off halfway, but decided to wait for the big party scene and was disappointed  in the payoff, there really wasn't any.  The biggest sin though was it just wasn't that funny.  The scene in the gender neutral bathroom had me rolling my eyes. Like sure that's how that convo would have went down.  That scene in particular really was a big missed opportunity, should have been hilarious.  It just felt like there was missed opportunity after missed opportunity.

After reading rave reviews from critics I trust and respect and having the film highly recommended to me by my friends, I was excited to see Olivia Wilde‚Äôs directorial debut. This movie left me absolutely speechless in the worst possible way. I couldn‚Äôt believe this was the same film people were discussing with such praise. The writing was atrocious, the jokes rarely landed, spare a few good moments, and the pacing was horrendous. I nearly walked out of the theater, but like a train wreck, I couldn‚Äôt look away. The film was completely discombobulated, with little to no tonal continuity throughout. I simply don‚Äôt understand how anyone enjoyed this film. I‚Äôm not trying to hate on the movie, I just simply don‚Äôt understand what viewers and critics alike enjoyed about it... I would love to hear what people enjoyed because I want to like this film and love Olivia Wilde and Beanie Feldstein but I am left utterly disappointed and confused.

eqztgsc,"Do they go to a school for very rich, weird smart liberal kids? Everyone namedropping Ivy Leagues like they're nothing. But considering the college admissions scandal, seems like there are resources, money and connections that may have led kids to getting into these schools. It takes more than a 1560 SAT and AP classes to get into Yale. Molly didn't misjudge how smart these kids were, but rather they misjudged the resources that these kids had at their disposable, considering how she seems to come from a normal background. That's one aspect I felt was wrong about the movie. Also, I didn't like Molly as a character lol. I don't know why. Amy seems chill tho.  Felt Amy's crush on Ryan was a bit strange, since she was just a regular looking tumblr type of girl.


This movie is getting rave reviews, but I don't really like it that much. Two leads were decent. Dialogue was realistic for teenaged gen z people I guess, but this seemed like it's trying so hard to be quirky.

eovl5xo,"I think my expectations were too high, what with the RT score and the Superbad comparisons. I thought some of it worked, but a lot of felt forced.

**PROS:**

-I truly bought the friendship between Amy and Molly. I thought Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie played really well off each other. 

-Will Forte and Lisa Kudrow stole both scenes they were in. I understand why they couldn't be in the movie more because of plot, but I genuinely laughed the hardest at both times we saw them.

-The pool scene was really well done, both the cinematography and the music choice.

**CONS**:

-With the exception of Triple A, the side characters were all so one dimensional for me, especially Gigi and the drama guys. The first Gigi scene was fine, but after a while it started to wear a bit thin. I also didn't really buy the dynamic between her and Jared at all. Also, I get the beats they were trying to hit with going from party to party, but if Gigi and Jared were going to end up at Nick's anyways, why didn't Molly and Amy just stick with them?

-It had a bit of Juno vibes with the dialogue a bit, with trying to make weird and jokey teen dialogue that felt forced at times. 

-The doll scene just completely felt flat. Usually I love drug trips during movies, but this one just felt so unnecessary. I kept waiting for it to cut to them in real life, struggling to climb on the desk all wooden and crazed out, but it didn't. Instead we got a one second cutaway to them leaving the house like that.

-The end with Pat the Pizza Guy... I liked the visual gag at first of the Wanted poster of him, but then they really hit us over the head with it.

To me, Superbad felt real. The payoffs were better. The scenes felt more organic. Booksmart was okay, maybe I'd even call it good, but I don't think it's deserving of the ""generational comedy"" monicker. A solid 6/10 for me.",bs6w7x

eotc622,"I thought it was decent. It definitely didn't feel like LA. SF maybe. It had some good laughs but not enough. 

What I didn't quite get was the main character's story arc. Like she was a mean person. People were like ""I don't like her personality."" She hangs out with the other people one night, but she's a mean person at the party. She's only nice to her one friend and the boy she has a crush on. Where is her character development?

Also, I thought it was super weird for a movie like this to have the lesbian girl fall for the hot girl in the bathroom, but only after the hot girl was **mean to her**. She comes into the bathroom crying. The other girl talks a bunch of shit to her. And instead of getting insulted, the girl is like totally enamored and wants the other girl. It's like on the one hand, I'm not saying that unrealistic, a lot of people do tend to get attracted to people that treat them like shit (i'm not saying that's good, but it happens, a lot). On the other hand, why is it in this super woke ultra progressive movie? And why is no one picking up on this paradox? Was this supposed to be funny?

eos3b5w,"Judging by the reviews I'm way in the minority, but I didn't like this movie. It felt unrealistic in the worst kind of way. The parties they go to were nothing like HS parties I went to. I never once was on a yacht, or drugged with hallucinogenic strawberries at a murder mystery. The dialogue didn't feel like how teens actually talk to one another. The friendship didn't feel real. The movie was progressive to the point of being unbelievable.The casting was great, but for me, it was the only great thing.The thing I loved about Superbad was that it felt real. I knew kids like those in HS. The dialogue was straight out of conversations i'd heard or had. The parties felt like HS parties. This movie does not have that, imo.

But I could be wrong. I haven't been in HS in a long while now. Maybe unisex bathrooms are the norm, and the parties are over the top murder mysteries thrown by the equally over the top gay kids or rides on yachts. Maybe HS boys today really don't see weight when talking about girls. None of that was HS when I was in it, but maybe it is now.  


Edit: just to clarify, I would give the movie a 5/10. I thought it was average, not horrible. When I say I don't like it I mean that as ""I don't have any desire to see it a second time"" not that it's objectively bad.",bs6w7x

Why make them so goddamn obnoxious and so in-your-face? Humour is subjective for sure, but I found barely anything that funny in it at all. All the other characters are mostly weak and don't offer anything memorable. Nothing to me made it stand out from your average teen girl Comedy movie. It's predictable, cliche, vulgar, and just plain dumb.

The acting is fine, the production values are decent for what it is, but my god the use of music got irritating in places. It follows the typical Coming-Of-Age teenage girl friendship stuff and I just didn't care by the end of it because I did not like these characters at all.

The hallway end-of-year celebration shot as a rave/party scene at the beginning of the film was awesome 

The fantasy dance number between Molly and Nick 

The underwater scene with Amy

The long-take of Molly and Amy fighting going back and forth 

Also, when the girls start complementing each other on their outfits for the first time, the most hilarious part of that was the implication that they do this EVERY SINGLE TIME, just like the dancing outside of the car. I loved their energy and hope to see them in future films.

What a straight-up cool fucking movie",bs6w7x
eoqxwqm,"Was disappointed by this movie after seeing the trailer and review scores.  It was about 15 minutes in and I realized I hadn‚Äôt laughed at anything because it was all in the trailer.  I started to get bored watching it and realized that the jokes/humor isn‚Äôt working because very little rings true in the movie.  

I just saw too many logical inconsistencies for me, a joke or humor works if there is a little bit of truth to it and I just never bought in.  Also I didn‚Äôt like many of the characters.  Basically every character is has their quirks turned up to 11.  And there is no straight man to play off against.  And they all seem to hate each other except for the two leads.  

A lot of it feels rushed in the beginning and the catalyst to start this movie is a bit ridiculous.   I was not surprised when I saw this had four writers to it, so it feels like the script went through a couple re-writes and jokes were put in places where it didn‚Äôt make much sense.

I thought the two leads had real good chemistry and there are some good stuff in here but I never found myself laughing all that much and not much rest of the theater was either.  Really disappointed in this one.",bs6w7x

ep8o22a,"I know I‚Äôm late to the party, but I didn‚Äôt think this movie was as good as most are making it out to be. Everything in the movie was dialed up to 11, to the point where some of it was just stupid. A lot of jokes landed, but tons of jokes didn‚Äôt for me. The chemistry between the leads was great, and some of the side characters were funny, but a lot of some of them were overused and some of them could have been cut out pretty much completely. It‚Äôs obvious that this movie was trying to be Superbad with its own spin, but the reason Superbad was so good was that while it had parts that were totally bogus, it also had parts that reminded us so accurately what it was like to be in high school or to be a loser. This movie gets some of that right but it has so much bonkers, off the wall, bizarre bullshit *constantly* that I don‚Äôt think it really achieves that. You might argue that it doesn‚Äôt have to do what Super ad did, but when it‚Äôs so clearly trying to be this generations superbad I think it should have. Stuff like riding a skateboard down the hall while shooting a fire extinguisher or jumping off a boat because ‚Äúwtf I‚Äôm so random and crazy‚Äù or driving someone else‚Äôs car into a fence to bust into your graduation or a teacher fucking one of her students right after they graduated.. idk. Superbad could get crazy too, but it was peppered in so that when it happened it really landed. This was just a world where adults don‚Äôt exist and everything has gotta be fucking crazy all the goddamn time. 

Overall, decent laugh but really not my thing.",bs6w7x

eol5onf,"Was fortunate to see this tonight with a beginning introduction from both Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever here in Toronto. So that was pretty unexpected, but also pretty neat.

This was a fun movie that was definitely a bit silly / wacky. Brought back a lot of that crude, sex humor from late 90's / early 2000s that was so popular back then, which is cool.

It's definitely playing to a very 2010's / generation Z audience. Everything is very inclusive, there's a character in it for everyone to relate too. This is almost to its detriment because it felt like it was ticking boxes to get everyone in there instead of just being authentic.

I still think the movie had good characters, I just felt like the acting didn't work for me sometimes? Beanie Feldstein is really strong, and Kaitlyn Dever is good, but when you're matched up with Beanie the entire time it's hard to get to her level of energy. The supporting cast was good (Billie Lourd was especially awesome) but there was just something off about a few of their performances. They felt underwhelming.

Pretty impressive directorial debut from Olivia Wilde, she made a lot of interesting choices, loved how she shot a couple of the scenes, very unexpected. I think there were a couple directing and editing hiccups here and there though. The movie comes at you fast and because of that it can feel a little sloppy at times. But there's a lot of quotable scenes here and I think kids / teenagers / young adults are gonna love it.

It's really hard to not compare it to Super Bad when it even has freaking Jonah Hill's sister in one of the lead roles! I think I'm more in the Super Bad camp as a favourite film, but I saw this with my girlfriend and she liked this movie better. To each their own!

Even though this was marketed as a comedy, there were definitely some nice heartfelt moments especially during the party and the ending. Film also edifies a good message of not to prejudge people, as they are not always what they seem until you truly get to know them.

I love comedy, but very rarely laugh out loud even during a comedy I truly adore.  This movie had me laughing to the point that I had to back netflix up to re-watch a scene I missed. Not only that, it made me fucking smile.  That sounds silly to say, but I found myself about a third of the way through with just a big dumb grin on my face because the movie is just honestly special.  It feels authentic, earnest, and genuine all at once. You really believe these actors are kids in high school who've known each other for years and years.  in 100 minutes you're made to genuinely care about not only the main character but multiple side characters as well (the little interactions with Jared, Hope, and AAA all were amazing) and amid all the chaos and comedy there are some scenes that are going to be talked about for a while, for really good reasons. Even the soundtrack is fucking fire.

AND ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT, it's fucking funny.  Like seriously funny.  Not cheap laughs either, but some real payoff jokes (like Ling Ling!) combined with situational humor that manages to feel neither contrived or awkward and dialogue that is fucking impeccable.  

Cannot recommend enough.",bs6w7x
eos6osq,"This movie was beautifully made, and the acting was on point. Like, the film had no right to be so ambitious with it's cinematography or soundtrack and even less of a right for it to work *so well*. It is definitely a peak in the genre of coming of age high school comedies.

That said, the comparisons to Superbad (deserved comparisons, this film is *almost* a remake and fucking Jonah Hill's sister plays the ""Seth"" here) highlight the biggest flaw of Booksmart; the writing. Superbad had one of the tightest screenplays of all time. Don't get me wrong, the writing for Booksmart was solid - the jokes were funny and the characters memorable. It might have the best on screen argument of the year. But *a lot* of the narrative felt strung together. The scenes felt like a conglomeration of funny sketches. The different parties were set pieces and not logically parts of a nerdy duos one crazy high school night. Another flaw with the writing is that it went for Big Moments of Character Growth. Molly tells an entire crowd how she now respects everybody in her class. There's a teary goodbye at an airport (undercut by a joke, but the emotional punch is still there). Amy's character is more subtle, but still very directly given her chatartsis for the night of craziness - pretty girl from party comes to her house and gives Amy her number.


Superbad was a *lot* more realistic with it's narrative structure than ""okay we're going to this party because some person we hardly know gave us an address"", and the resolution for it's character growth was masterfully understated. It felt more like a movie written by high-schoolers about their life than Booksmart, which felt like a good movie about high-school written by adults.


This has turned into a review of Superbad at this point haha. Overall Booksmart was really fun, had a lot of heart, and was aggressively well-made. 4/5 and I'm going to make some friends go see it on Monday.",bs6w7x

Can we talk about the pointless unmotivated animated sequence? Why were they dolls? And why those dolls? The scene seems to exist only to have a wacky drug trip and make feminist commentary on doll bodies. But in context of the film it was just random. I love a good dream sequence or stop-motion gag.

eq7y2td,"The first thing to be said for me is that I'm so far away from the target demographic that I wasn't going to like this movie no matter what less it truly is a masterpiece of its genre and I didn't feel it was near that so take my opinion with a grain of salt. It seems the reviews have been extremely positive so there's that.

I didn't find the movie very funny at all. Some parts were cute and made me smile, but there were almost no 'laugh out loud' accept for maybe one part (Molly finding out her peers weren't the losers she thought they were and going into crisis mode). Everything else was mediocre. 

I didn't get the impression the two main characters (Molly and Amy) were ever booksmart. There was no exposition to show their skills in any way. They were so eccentric and animated, they felt more or less just like all the other kids accept for some lawyer terminology they used in a few small bits. The movie almost could have been been called 'socially awkward'. Perhaps that's my fault of expecting more nerdy stuff in this movie other than perhaps them bragging about their accomplishments.

The movie was very 'by the book' predictable and unoriginal. Each girls crush and inevitable disappointment when their crushes let them down was so predictable it was nauseating. The same could be said for the porno being played over the car stereo. I don't know, I've seen this movie a dozen times before and they aren't particularly great to begin with.

There were some positives, all the actors and actresses played good parts, were extremely animated and eccentric, it felt like you're watching overly dramatic high school kids having fun in drama class. They were heavy handed with feminist terminology and made it no secret this was ment for young girls and they likely got some message about balancing social expectations, sex, relationships, and career success. Seemed there were small good messages throughout the film which is good if one were to analyze a movie like that.

Again, I'm just not the target demographic for this movie so me trying to be as objective as possible won't cut it as I just don't like this genre (I never particularly liked any of the dudebro weed lmao Superbad movies either).",bs6w7x

I know I'm taking this personally but as a woman who was treated the way Molly treated Triple A in high school by the Mollys of the world I found it difficult to cheer for her, which kind of ruined an otherwise well written and funny movie for me. 

But then again, I lived for the bathroom scene. Because I loved the look on those girls faces when they found out I graduated with a 4.0 and a masters degree.

But then, both of these movies are borrowing a lot from every other teen coming-of-age movie with a big party and/or graduation scene like Sixteen Candles, Say Anything, Can't Hardly Wait, etc. It just feels like I've seen this same basic story a million times already. Like for example, I got a large soda and had to pee really bad towards the end. So when they got to the scenes where things were clearly wrapping up and Amy was leaving for Africa, I just got up and left because I didn't really need to see the ending and the inevitable emotional goodbye at the airport.

I didnt really like the movie, granted some jokes where on point, most ones I laughed at where the ones when the two main girls where socialising with the other school students, I personally  didnt laugh at any that Amy and Molly had together, which is a shame, I felt that they delivered it poorly without enough energy, and the movie suffers from this as a comedy....

I felt that the character develpment between the two girls sort of fell flat, maybe because they are young actors that need more experience to feel ""real"" connection between them, the conflict at the end was somewhat realistic from what would happen when things get into the life of two best friends (Experienced this myself numerous times in life as a guy)..

The films plot is honestly basic, kind of like superbad, every scene happens within two days (One night), its fast paced which is used a lot in comedy but in the sufferance of proper character development as a result from what ive seen:

ezfux9f,"Extremely overrated. 97% on rotten tomatoes makes no sense. If you liked it good for you, it's not for me though and I usually like these type of movies. A lot of reviews that I saw liked it because it was empowering to women (I saw celebrities were endorsing it after I watches the movie) or similar to why people like Amy Schumer because it's taboo for women to say certain things. I can understand liking it for the second reason if that is your type of humor but I didn't find it funny. But just to give it good reviews because it stars women in a unusual role and directed by a women doesn't mean the movie is good and shouldn't be rated as such. There are plenty of movies that star women in unusual roles for women that are great. For example, Captain Marvel (not Wonder Woman though which is another example of a movie being rated high because it stars a girl). There are movies that are directed by women that are phenomenal and recognized as such. For example, The Hurt Locker is arguably the best movie in the past ten years. I don't get why everyone needs to overhype things. I was excited to try the ""female Superbad"" not because it was female or male led but because I like Superbad type movies. This just wasn't good. The humor was forced. 

P.S. I'm sure many agree with me that it is sad that the movie had to be advertised (not openly) as the ""female Superbad"" instead of ""a Superbad-esque"" movie. That is what creates this overhype society. I also understand that people feel they need to overhype because of sexist trolls as seen by those who attacked Captain Marvel and the new Ghostbusters (which I didn't like but was not as bad as the haters made it out to be).

but despite the sameness, i fully feel that Booksmart evolves past what Superbad did. Is it full of super liberal characters? yes, but it does a great job of not being preachy (and even poking fun at the bleeding heart aspects of the leads). 

The side characters are awesome (Gigi, the dinner party couple, the kid with the super long hair, sudekis), and the bits come at a steady pace, with the peak being the Lyft Cardi B scene (youll know it when you hear it lol)

high high recommend, especially if you have A List. also, i know tats are trendy now, but shit it felt like every other kid had a tattoo in this film. Im here for it as a man with sleeves, but sheesh times have changed lol",bs6w7x

While the actors no doubt can be hailed as the new stars and starlets of the film industry, and their performances were great, I couldn't help but be numb to the story while I was being bludgeoned to near vegetative state by the clear agenda the writers put forward. Perhaps that came from my confusion at what this film was supposed to be portraying and what is was supposed to be. So many questions that perhaps those of you on reddit more enlightened by the film could answer for me, as I am genuinely curious.   
   
\- Is this the new hot take on the youth of America today?   
\- Is the film supposed to be satirical in nature?   
\- Why are the some of the most flagrantly stereotypical roles assigned only to the minorities and people of color in the film?   
\[I.E ***The only Mexican student happens to be a stoner/coder, the only black characters are a gay theater actor \[trope\] and a teacher that happens to be a sex predator (but because this high school student is supposed to be 20 it's ok?). Why is the only trans student (might be or might not be, I couldn't tell) another theater caricature? Surely you can have more representation as not all black gays or trans students are entirely involved in theater.***  
\- Is this film supposed to accurately portray casual drug use and it's effects? **\[Who else found the drug obsessed character that Carrie Fisher's daughter played completely on the nose?\]**   
\- Are the ""Well we all got into good schools"" characters that are seemingly dim witted by one of the protagonists supposed to be accurate? I think one look at their social media would turn off most of the colleges they seemed to get into.   


\- Those whom I spoke with after the viewing were hailing this as ""What the future generations will look like"", but all I saw were a bunch of insanely rich, usually white, Californian kids at the very pinnacle of the progressive/liberal totem pole. Surely people know that the entirety of the youth of America today is much more diverse of both thought and action then this film seemingly portrays. How do kids from the middle of nowhere relate to this films culture of excess? Is that truly how things are nowadays?  


\- The dialogue, oh man. While the few jokes that did land get their praise, I get it. This was written by a group of radical leftist feminists with writing degrees and a penchant for complex dialogue. I get it, you are trying to be Superbad, and you cut quite a lot of that movies themes and content and slapped it into your film. But I suppose I'm not the target audience being a CIS/WM with a moderate viewpoint.  


\- Why is the Pizza delivery driver who spends his entire scene of screen time being one of the only characters to talk sense to our two protagonists, (**Seriously, is this scene supposed to be idiotic?**) and who just happens to be white and male, turn out to be a wanted predator and murder? We get it. To a certain group, us straight white men are the lowest of the low to you writers out there, but come on. It's getting ridiculous at this point. 



\- So the moral of the story is what exactly? Live life and get good grades? Don't waste your life on school before setting off to college? The only humans who seem to want more from life are our two protagonists, (gap year in Africa go you!), and the hippie girl at the end. Everybody else is off to the land of massive student loan debt, (or not because it's rich kids from LA) and the toxic tech spheres of massive corporations and social media.

ep1op5k,"I really enjoyed the movie. 

I wish there was a little more to it at the end, I would have liked to see Amy and Molly eating pancakes and have them talk about their argument a little more in depth and have more of a heartfelt moment. That part felt a bit brushed under the rug. 

That would have made the film feel more complete, imo.



I enjoyed the side characters a lot, Skyler Gisondo's character especially. 
I think I'm biased though because I love Eric in Santa Clarita Diet. 
He just brought something to Jared that I can't quite put my finger on. He just felt so genuine. 




As someone who has seen Superbad, I felt this movie had more heart and didn't feel as mean as the vibes I get off of Superbad. I don't know if that makes sense. 





I enjoyed the film overall. I would give it a 4/5.",bs6w7x

f06k0vx,"The movie had some legitimately great comedic moments, like the scene with the serial killer pizza man, and the duo who played the gay couple. But overall, I was disappointed. Good comedy, don't get me wrong, but I think I overhyped it. I would not put this over Good Boys this year. 

The overall vibe of the movie felt so...in your face? with progressiveness. I know that sounds bad, but a lot of it felt like, ""hey kids, look at this GAY kid who is also a genius!!"" I don't know, good movie overall but the fact this has a 97% on RT confuses me",bs6w7x

eq3ca5x,"Maybe it was the inconsiderate people that were being annoying af in my theatre that took me away from enjoying the movie, or maybe it was just that it wasn't that good. The best part was honestly the argument scene (1 long impressive take) and the pool scene with the music in the background. 

Yes there were a few things I chuckled at but beyond that, to me it was a late 2010s version and 100% recycled script straight out of Superbad with forced crude ""humor"". Didn't know while watching that Molly is actually Jonah Hill's sister - doesn't surprise me now. What made Superbad great, and most movies, is of course the originality the realistic and unforced dialogue. Here they seemed to cram in anything that had to do with vaginas into all dialogues. Another unrealistic portrayal here was the sheer amount of ""diversity"".

I love the representation (lgbtqia characters that aren‚Äôt used as a trope) and some of the camerawork very not seen a comedy like this. I can see all the connection to Superbad. Superbad is a full played where the leads are ‚Äúthe losers‚Äù. Booksmart plays everyone as mostly equal. I see this as a good companion piece with that film. They would play awesome together as a double feature or a drive-in tandem. I hope it hits big but with all that is out this weekend, I can see it getting lost.

The rythm is crazy, you have no time to lose focus. Among plenty other things, Olivia Wilde masters the musical transitions like nobody. 
It's definitely more than just a ""teen movie"", it will stay around for a long time I'm sure of it. There are so many details you miss at first cause you're either laughing at a joke or you're touched by the fluidity of the actors performances.

This movie was horrible because the plot is ridiculous. Having just graduated high school last year, I can tell you that: almost nobody gets into highly competitive colleges, no kid can just nonchalantly rent a yacht to attempt a party‚Äîa character in this movie rented a yacht for this stupid reason, nobody coincidentally runs into a serial killer and uses that knowledge to get out of jail, you can‚Äôt skate in the hallways and throw toilet paper and do dumb shit similar to that in today‚Äôs high school. I have no idea where that last trope originated. Also, why would they watch porn in the back seat of their principal‚Äôs car? It makes no fucking sense.

I could also see Diana Silvers getting a lot more after this. She did so so much with relatively little screentime.

Bill Hader: There's not really a good allegory here because the adult actors are all established stars already (Olivia Wilde clearly used her rolodex of IOU's to good effect).  I think you're going to see Skyler Gisondo get a LOT more work now that Santa Clarita is over (RIP). He is SO fucking funny in everything he does, and fills that 'silly' niche that I think Bill Hader reveled in for a big stretch of his career before he pivoted and showed that he could kill it on things like Barry as well.

 I mean the lady who told them that ended up going to the HS party with them and having sex with one of her students. She clearly doesn't make good decisions.   
 The fact is you and your friends are doing dumb shit in your 20's because you're in your 20's. That's what they're for. Partying is not an aspect of HS for lots of people, it's a college thing. I hate this idea that you're missing out on your youth if you're not partying in HS. You and your friends didn't miss out on anything. HS is for sleepovers, and video games, and going to the movies.

As the voices go mute, you can see one of them mention ‚ÄúMalala‚Äù again which would have lightened the mood, had you heard it.

Add that onto the reality of the fact that all those kids got into great schools because their parents are probably legacy families who donate tons of money to the Ivy Leagues.

I basically stopped being involved in school activities and stopped doing homework or showing up half the time. At 15 I latched on to a group of 20ish somethings. I just partied my week nights away. I did and saw things no 15 year old should lol

I burnt out by 22. I never finished college but managed to start a company at 18 (who the fuck know how I managed that). I had planned to travel and work abroad but never did because I had been attached to this group and stayed back a few times specifically for a few old flames. I over did that life. I was so fascinated by these people and life. I felt like a young documentarian exploring this counter culture. I had no interest in growing up with my classmates. 

I‚Äôd like to say I regret it all. But I don‚Äôt. It made me who I am and gave me perspective on what it means to live. But maybe I could have balanced it better. At 27 I packed up our tiny car and drove across the whole country to experience California and stability in my life. Now in my mid 30‚Äôs I am looking to experience things I ignored living those previous lives. I am making a bucket list and thinking of going back to college.

It suddenly goes from being a comedy to being a series of dramatic moments that don't work and go on for longer than needed to convey their intended message.

Instead we see a bit of the teacher being, not the cool teacher that  they relate to, but the awkward nerd that they are who grew up a little bit, went through her own overcompensating phase, and now is doing a decent job of hiding it most of the time. Getting to see more of that crashing back down would have been an excellent vision of their own potential futures and provided some much-needed levity during a leaden portion of the film.

The doll sequence was amusing, but it was clear that it was shoehorned in with no real regard for the plot or structure. Reading that it was just an idea that Wilde had, and she asked the screenwriter doing the most recent set of revisions to just put it in somewhere wasn't surprising. The entire murder mystery party ends up being a rather pointless detour that isn't really explored. Not to mention even the host evidently bailing on it and showing up later at Nick's party.

I think the little arc with Hope was the most prominent example, I didn't really get what we were supposed to make of the Hope character, or where that came from, or what it was really adding. It just felt a bit out of place, in what was otherwise an incredibly well made movie. 

It's not uncommon for a movie that's really and truly centered around two leads to be a bit more hit and miss when it comes to the side characters. I think I'd have prefer the runtime cut down a bit if they spent a bit less time on some of the earlier tangents (like the first two parties they go to could have been a really brief scene in total, rather than a pretty significant stretch of the movie). And the Hope character was the other part of the runtime that felt off. But the rest of the movie was fantastically well done.",bs6w7x

Some of the clich√©s I noticed were: all women are best friendsies, the two characters are constantly emotionally validated by each other and the only white characters are the less characters. Since it has to be politically correct, the movie becomes somewhat predictable and very ""safe"". Then again I don't think the movie set out to be ""the new superbad"", as some people has called it. Thus I also think that comparison isnt fair to Superbad.",bs6w7x

The details in movie were really well put. Basically, Hope is a ""Jerk with a good heart"" kind of person. She was already into Amy from the start yet she was projecting hate to cover up a desire (Just like Gigi said to Molly) She was always showing her mean side to hide her feelings, especially with Amy. Remember the very first scene when she interacted with Amy, she was both flirting and also being mean by making a comment about Amy's getting her teacher's number.

And when they've encountered in the bathroom at the party, things got heated and they just started to hook up which appearently Hope craved because she started to smile/laugh and show her soft side at that moment, she was down for it more than anything.  Throughout in the whole movie she was avoiding interacting with anyone (except Amy)  Then some unfortunate thing happened, Amy puked on her accidentally and  well... Hope understandably freaked out. Then in the following day, in their graduation ceremony, we see Hope while she is smiling and applausing Amy.  Even this short scene tells us much about her development.

In the end, Hope visits Amy's house to bring her underwear (ah wait, why didn't she just leave that if it wasn't important :D) and with a card that is written her phone number in her pocket. While talking with Amy she was soft again and obviously lovin' the way how nervous and adorable Amy was. Eventually she gives her phone number to her. Their interaction started with ""did you score your teacher's number?"" and it concluded with Amy's scoring Hope's number :D

Despite the movie's being short, there are surprisingly many telltale signs about characters and their development.  In a way all dialogues are connected with each other.",bs6w7x

Two months after my class graduated, one of our teachers was arrested for sexually exploiting one of my classmates (I believe she was 18-19 at the time), and it tore our class apart. Some blamed the girl, most of us were disgusted with the teacher, but all of us were unnerved that this all happened while we were in school.  She was of age to consent in our state (thankfully TX has laws against student/teacher relationships), but it didn't change the power disparity and the inappropriateness of the behavior.

I expected the teacher in the movie to try to sneak into the party, but I was totally grossed out by her behavior towards the student. :( Given how intentional the movie was about a lot of things, I don't really know why they had to include a character like her.

epcrq9a,"Some of the humor really fell flat. Like with a resounding thud that kept backing the movie into a corner where it had to now work extra hard to win me back over (which it would usually do, but it was wholly unnecessary if the jokes had been more polished). 

There were also too many characters that completely didn't work for me. Billie Lourd's was the saddest example: I get what they were trying to do with her, the rich girl up for anything who uses excess to try to escape the drab reality of upper-class suburban existence, but it just had been done better in so many other movies that she felt like a barely-fleshed-out carbon copy of the real thing. 

The two gay friends were also SOOO very tropey, and yet the movie seemed to think their every word was hilarious because they said it with overdramatic panache. That's not the same as actual funny writing! 

Eh, I'm being harder on the movie than I actually mean to, but I really wanted to LOVE it and I just merely liked it, and only in the moment.

I suspect there's just going to be a general gap between how men and women view the film.  Not entirely, but they won't be perfectly aligned.

What's great about her character, though, is that while taking on such a stereotype in the high school, she's simultaneously a goofy young woman trying to figure out how to be a teenager before running off to college.

I didn't really have a set friend group, on any given day I could be with a different set of friends, and it didn't really matter what kind of people they were, they would generally enjoy my company.

Parties were also similar. Even if I didn't hang out with them much, when I would get to a party, they would do that ""Ayyy!"" And then tell me to come and get a drink or take a shot with them. Then we would talk and go around saying hi to all people I knew there. They were always welcoming.

The only people that weren't really friends with anyone were the ones that excluded themselves. I didn't go to a small school either. My school alone had around 2000 people, about 500 people per grade. The people I'm talking about were generally in the same grade.",bs6w7x

I really enjoyed out witty and ridiculous the dialogue was in Booksmart.  Do kids actually talk like that?  Absolutely not, but I was laughing out loud way more than I did during Superbad.

Like, okay, the girls accidentally take a hallucinogen, this could be funny. But turning them into dolls was so over the top that the scene didn't work for me.It wasn't anything like what doing drugs is. I would rather just have the girls talk while tripping. Like, compare that to the scene in knocked up where they trip (a very different movie, I know.) ""There are 5 different types of chairs in this hotel room."" ""Oh my god, what are they all doing here?"" ""This is 5 different types of chairs."" ""Get em out of here! That's too many chairs for one room."" 

That's funny to me because it's real. I've done drugs. I could see that conversation happening on drugs. 

And parts of the movie felt out of place? Like, the scene where amy swims was really well done. It was a great scene. But it felt like it was taken from a whole different movie. It had a completely different tone.

Sorry for jumping into this, I'm not American so sorry for my candor. I kept seeing comments saying that this school is ""rich"" but there are profanities covered everywhere in the bathroom. Is it standard in America?

There's no scene with him going ""ya know it hurts being called splinterdick because I was born with a tiny dick. I wish people would call me my real name."" Like the one annabelle gets. Amy, our sort of moral voice of reason in this movie, the character who says she wont watch porn because of the women who were forced into it, the character who tells us we need unisex bathrooms to make life better for trans people, even goes so far as to say ""Well that's not sex shaming him it's just an accurate description""

  And it‚Äôs clear you dislike Superbad but I think it‚Äôs a far better movie than you remember. There‚Äôs a reason it‚Äôs still talked about nearly a decade later. Not only was it funny but it had something to say. The movie is about friendship and change and growing apart, and it states that early and often. Not to mention it‚Äôs understated point about consent. 
  It was in no way just a dumb comedy. It captured a feeling lots of people related to. I know I did. 
  I mean I can immediately tell you the themes of Superbad and what the movie was about underneath the jokes, but I‚Äôm having trouble doing that with Booksmart. 

 There are scenes upon scenes of characters talking about how hard it must be for two best friends to move apart like that in superbad. Scenes of McLovin and Evan talking about how they‚Äôre gonna room together but haven‚Äôt told Seth. In the first 5 minutes it‚Äôs stated and shown that the movie is about these two friends dealing with becoming different people with their own lives separate from one another. 
  And then it ends with them walking away from each other with their new relationships, in an ending that‚Äôs as bittersweet as it is real. 

  Couple that with Seth‚Äôs motivation to get Jules drunk being that she‚Äôs only dated guys with good bodies and would never want someone like him, and that the only way he could have a chance with her is if she makes a drunk mistake, despite the evidence to the contrary, despite her obviously liking his personality, speaks to how a lot of kids with self esteem issues/body issues felt/feel. 

  And then there‚Äôs Evan arguing that it‚Äôs wrong to get girls drunk to fuck them, that they need to just be honest and tell them how feel. Which was way ahead of its time in terms of the mainstream views on consent.

Anyhoo, like I said there's some issues with framing. A lot of the film goes straight into extreme close-ups without establishing where those characters are so you're left trying to decipher that information by looking over the shoulders or ears of the actor on screen. Maybe it's just a nitpick but it stood out so much that I couldn't shake it off and kept seeing it repeatedly throughout the film.

I hate it when people make baseless claims like this but I can't help but feel the positivity is contrived and not real. This movie is no way as good as people are making it out to be. It has a lesbian main character, mentions feminists terms, has a guy in drag... Yeah no I can see the writing on the wall. This smells like the Ghostbusters remake where people were supporting that shit for it's agenda rather than it's content.

EDIT - I'm not going to bother replying as most people have their minds made up. What I was trying to say that the REVIEWS and positive opinions for such a mediocre movie must be pushed by people with an agenda. I have no problem with the movie itself, but I'm not some sort of weird anomaly I think when it comes to my tastes and this movie simply wasn't very good. I believe that people are overlooking the flaws of the movie BECAUSE it shows lgbt representation. If they weren't represented, I dont think people would be gushing over such a flawed movie, especially the paid critics. This does happen and it happens quite often. Look at Tyler Perry's movies he shits out every year. The only reason black people like it is because it has black people in it and they want to support them.",bs6w7x

And 2) I don't think it's just because of the character. The director Olivia Wilde's mom is Leslie Cockburn, who was a democratic house candidate, and who wrote a book called ""Dangerous Liaison"" that bashed US policy towards Israel.

I learnt that the best nights I had trying to compensate for lost time was always with close friends doing something bizarre (for my lifestyle at the time). It always began when we drank a little and wanted to go on an adventure walk aimlessly and somehow things just lined up. You meet some unique people, randomly get invited to some apartment where you end up beating everyone in a Chinese checkers contest even though you never played in over a decade. Clubs and house parties were almost always a disappointment and I learnt quickly that it's pointless to try be happy in those environments.

It's like when a Magic the Gathering tournament bans using poor hygiene as a distraction tactic vs an opponent. Seems ridiculous from the outside at first glance, but to someone who's been in the same social circle for themselves, it becomes a kind of funny gag.

I honestly think that it really has to do with the fact that there may have been too many chefs in the kitchen with the 4 writers. That drug trip scene was a pain to watch. You can tell that they had no experience with psychedelics or did any real research on the subject to do a better portrayal in the film. Yes, I definitely think some critics may have been compromised by all of the political correctness these days to give this film an honest review.

eraqueb,"The fact that the kids in the beginning aren't talking about Molly's weight is already a sign that they're not the shallow kids Molly assumes they are. They're being mean, but they're fairly nitpicking Molly's shrill and uptight personality. They're not bullies and they don't hate Molly, they're criticizing her inability to let loose and have fun. When Molly and Amy show up to the party, like the asian kid says, ""it's all love"".

&#x200B;

My favorite thing about the movie is probably the way it addresses that ""holier than thou"" mentality so many introverted/awkward people have. I was a pretty quiet kid in high school and I spent a lot of time in my own head, or in books, or watching movies. I was a thinker, and at a subconscious level I thought that made me better than other people because I was so ""self-aware"".  


But this movie says fuck that. You can be into Harry Potter and be a jock. You can have sexual desires without being a slut. This movie reminds us that people can be so much more than we give them credit. Booksmart doesn't refer to just Molly and Amy, the rest of the kids are booksmart, too.  


Booksmart is kind of the antithesis of every nerd story where the main character feels like the whole world is against him/her. Sometimes, you're just projecting your insecurities onto other people and painting them as bad guys. Sometimes, you're not all that much of a black sheep, and you just need to relax and enjoy yourself. Other people will too.",bs6w7x

A teacher in my class this past semester had to explain to the class how to properly organize a paper.

She's just out without it being an issue. The character also gets to have the type of first sexual experience scene reserved for straight characters.

I don't mean to act superior here, as all opinions are valid, but I did graduate film school and I simply don't agree with that kind of read of this movie after having seen it twice now. It feels almost perfectly paced to me and the editing was great. There isn't a single scene or hell even line that feels unnecessary or out of place. Everything is set up and paid off perfectly, and the story moves along nicely from start to end. And I don't agree with saying it imitated any shots from Superbad, as it was a far more better shot and composed movie than Superbad. You could maybe argue it imitated plot points, but even then, I would disagree. There are obvious plot similarities but I wouldn't say they were imitation so much as that they are naturally similar movies, just Booksmart is far more artistically and smartly made.",bs6w7x

I personally don't know anybody like this. But I do know a lot of people *who went to schools like this*.

eouxgez,"Well that's very unfortunate for this movie if they themselves made that comparison. And it's clear that you like Superbad, which is fine, but I really still don't. I remember it just fine but I don't think those themes you mention ever come through in any meaningful or super well done way...they're all very surface level with little artistic merit behind them, and executed pretty lazily imo. 

And you can say there's a reason that it's remembered all these years later but that doesn't really mean it's actually a great movie...people remember and even love plenty of movies that I find to be incredibly overrated, and Superbad has always ranked very highly on that list. And at the time Superbad came out I was a high school boy who was going to be going to a college far away from my best friend who I had known since I was 4 years old, so I was the PRIME audience to relate to that movie, but again, once I saw it, I found the themes to be super shallow and the jokes to almost always fall flat.

Boomsmart, on the other hand, is incredibly smart and compassionately written, with real, 3-dimensional characters. The main girls go through much the same journey as the main boys in Superbad, but in a much more realistic way imo. And not only that, but the main character Molly goes through a much more meaningful and realistic arc than anyone in Superbad. She realizes through her experiences that she always felt she needed to prove she was better than everyone else when in reality everyone was out there doing their own thing and just trying to enjoy their lives in whatever ways they saw fit. She learns to stop slut shaming a girl who hooked up with a few dudes for mutual enjoyment, she learns to stop controlling her best friend and let her be her own person, and she learns that you can be successful and smart and well rounded while still allowing yourself to cut loose and have a little fun.

If you're having trouble identifying the themes and arc in Booksmart, I suggest going to watch it again, because I think it's much more well defined while also being less hand holdy than in Superbad. Superbad may feel easier to identify because they throw the themes in your face much more, but that doesn't mean they're better executed. To me that just adds to the laziness I feel from that movie.

Students *do* get into top tier colleges. In a good high school, a handful of students in every class gets into elite schools. They're usually the best of the best. This movie would have use believe that the two main characters are those students. It's basically the same setup as *Say Anything*, except in that movie the main character let loose and finally had fun by dating a guy. I don't see how it's unrealistic at all. By setting them up as the best of the best of up-tight overachievers, it makes for a better, more entertaining contract when they really cut loose.

epp5x5g,"Eh, it's not really worth it to sweat down votes, but I appreciate the support. (Honestly, I think initially my comment might've been misinterpreted as criticism of the poster above me, rather than me just sharing my thoughts)

Upon reflection, I think the issue for me is that what I enjoy from movies (including comedy movies) is at odds with what comedy movies generally want to provide. Like...I probably wasn't the target audience for a movie like Long Shot or Game Night, but I try and make it a habit of watching a variety of movies because I enjoy discussing them.

Personally my priorities in a movie is an interesting character (or characters) going through a struggle, or a theme that is relevant to me. (which is obviously very subjective). But like...an example of some ""broken characters"" that I like are....Greg House (House, MD), Yondu (Guardians of the Galaxy 2), Simon (Baby Driver), Baby (Baby Driver), Forest Tucker (Old Man & The Gun), Adrian Monk (Monk), Iron Man (Iron Man 1, Iron Man 2, Captain America: Civil War), Nate Ford (Leverage), Peter Parker (Spider-Man Homecoming), Amy (Booksmart), the entire cast of Tag, etc.

So for me, while a movie like Blockers, Game Night, and Long Shot might have me laughing, I leave not really...caring? They're absolutely funny and I recommend people watch them, but it's not the type of movie I'd watch more than once. Like...I'll use Long Shot as an example since it's more recent in my memory, but like...Flarsky was this political journalist and it would've been absolutely interesting to me if they kinda explored a bit more how his quest for integrity and truth would be at odds with Field's quest for ""squeaky-clean"" and popular. Like I love how it broke some common tropes in hilarious ways, but it seemed to just delay the tropes until the end.

I typically think movies with a solid theme or characters is more funny than a straight up comedy. So like...Love, Simon I thought was pretty funny (and I consider it to be a more tame version of Booksmart, honestly). And Tag I enjoyed because of the dynamic between the friends, and the growth each character had.

I guess to TL;DR it, I'm probably not the intended audience for something like Long Shot or Game Night, but like you said - comedy is subjective. I just enjoy the discussion.

The film starts the exact same way, the plots both revolve around getting to a party in which they both have romantic interests at. Molly was basically Seth in that she was after someone who she considers out of her league and is happy when she receives attention from them (they both happen to get on well). They both get into a car with a strange guy (not exactly the same but similar enough). They both have a sex scene at around the same point that ends up with the character puking on the person. They both revolve around the two best friend characters splitting off after school and one of them keeping a secret (Evan rooming with Fogel and Amy going to Africa for the whole year). Arguing about it once they're at the party and it comes out. I could go on. 

Honestly I think its nigh on offensive to Superbad to say it isn't imitating it haha, sure it did some new things though and that's great. I'm not saying it's a straight rip off. But to deny that Booksmart was created to be a female led Superbad for a new generation is just denying the truth and I have no doubt Olivia Wilde was aware of the influence.",bs6w7x

ep5xrxp,"Right on! I hope my saying I went to film school didn't come off too douchey lol I wasn't trying to invalidate your pov with that, more just trying to qualify my own pov a bit more!

And you're certainly somewhat right, I never meant to say Superbad wasn't an influence on this movie at all, of course it is, I just dislike the comparison because I think it does this movie a disservice in the sense that this movie was much more beautifully shot and creatively made than Superbad, with more rounded out, three-dimensional characters than those in Superbad. I will admit I have probably been too harsh on Superbad as I just never really enjoyed it to begin with, but I still stand by those thoughts.

I respect your opinion and I'm not trying to say my views invalidate it. It certainly seems like we just like different things about these movies and that's totally valid! But as to my point, I struggle to think of any shot or scene in Superbad that comes anywhere near the creativity and artistry on display in scenes like the stop-motion doll scene (which was done practically), the dance sequence, the pool sequence, or the one shot when she gets out of the pool all the way through the argument and her going to the bathroom. Those are the moments that shoot Booksmart way beyond Superbad (and pretty much all high school comedies) to me as far as being a well made, creative, and fresh movie. 

And yes you can absolutely say a lot of the plot points are very similar, and I won't deny that, but you could also point to plenty of 80s and 90s hs movies and say Superbad straight up copied a lot of beats from those too. Movies in the same genre tend to do that a lot. To me what sets Booksmart apart from the rest is that it isn't just a comedy, but a beautifully shot movie with more creativity and thought behind the cinematography than I've ever seen in the genre as a whole. 

But to each their own I suppose! I'm sorry if I was a dick during any of this conversation, I obviously feel pretty passionately about this movie lol.",bs6w7x

I thought it was fine that that's not what drugs are actually like, and I thought Amy liking her doll body was enough of a subversion that I didn't think the feminism of it felt forced.

ep6tima,"Yeah I mean I'm sure it creates certain potential problems that need to be worked out, but like for anyone who is attracted to the same sex, they already have to think about/deal with stuff like that in general without gender neutral bathrooms",bs6w7x
eoxf7nf,"I know, but I‚Äôm saying within the movie why would I assume that whatever they were dosed with would make them hallucinate their worst fear?",bs6w7x
evfy9vy,"I had no issue with the main character being a lesbian or a guy in drags, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an agenda per se. But all the rest was so ‚Äúwoke‚Äù god. All the posters and car stickers, one of the girls had a photo of Justice Ginsberg, a pro-abortion poster and a ‚Äúresist‚Äù sticker. The girls even used ‚ÄúMalala‚Äù as a feminist friendship code‚Äù, and one was leaving to Africa to made tampons.

This movie felt more like a white high class liberal fantasy than an honest look at high school and/or feminism. And god, I‚Äôve seen films by Jean-Luc Godard that are more subtle about its politics.",bs6w7x
epc7yoa,"I mean, if you find the humor is in the girls during this scene, I guess that makes sense, but I felt that the humor was supposed to be with the pizza guy and him trying to parent two kids while they were threatening him.",bs6w7x
eou5qx1,"Ah, so if you've never done that thing, it's not relatable, but only if it takes place in a high school?

Makes sense...",bs6w7x
epuulbu,"Oh I meant freaking out, like excited freaking out.

But I didn't read her as being outraged at all, but excitedly freaking out as she realizes Amy hooked up with the hot, popular, girl.",bs6w7x
eoutp8t,"Lol, and you're basing this off the fact you think superbad was written about kids, by kids for kids. I love it. This just might top baby boomers found reddit two years ago. Please keep following me. I'm enjoying these nuggets you're leaving.",bs6w7x
eowrerg,Not usually ever.,bs6w7x
epxvm0m,"I appreciate you saying that, and I agree it is refreshing to have a convo with an internet stranger that isn't inherently toxic and negative lol. I guess I just started to feel like I was being a dick because the more we talked, the more I realized we both have our own valid points and thus the discussion between the 2 movies really just comes down to a difference of opinion, which is totally valid! I'm glad you enjoy Superbad, and I'll go on enjoying Booksmart! Lol",bs6w7x
eot86oy,This is a liberal myth that we tell ourselves to feel better about our own mediocrity. I know for a fact that I am not 1/10 the person that gets into Harvard or MIT.,bs6w7x
epp3g04,"Sounds like my family too lol . My grandparents all passed before I was 3 but me, my parents and my brother all bond over movies. It‚Äôs hard to find a movie my mom truly enjoys but I‚Äôm at a 90% success rate at it after quite a few years of trial and error. We all work long hours so movies are really the easiest bonding time.",bs6w7x
ep6u5ro,We come a long way I suppose.  Our high school didn't have doors on any of the stalls.  I guess because they thought the boys would smoke or destroy stuff in the bathroom.  Now a boy and girl can take a dump in stalls right next to each other.,bs6w7x
eoxk7z7,"I understand that the movie doesn't really spell it out for people... and while I didn't understand the scene, I found it to be really hilarious. 

I don't know, maybe I'm an easy laugh. I'm definitely not a lesbian or feminist or even a girl, but I truly enjoyed this movie.",bs6w7x
evglm58,"As a person who aligns more with progressive politics than not, it came across as a caricature of white high-class liberal gen-z type women to me personally. I'm hesitant to assume that this particular portrayal was serious. Traveling to Africa to teach girls how to make tampons? An RGB shrine? Totally camp to me. An overwhelming exaggeration of a truth. This doesn't *really* happen...often.",bs6w7x
epc9hvn,"I mean really there are several jokes in the scene. Obviously the central one during the scene is that the guy educates them on having common sense, but then gives a very, very specific and creepy example of what he could do to them. And then later, the joke is that he was actually a serial killer. I don't really think that reveal changes much about the scene unless you really find it incredulous that a serial killer could not kill someone.",bs6w7x
eou6qxk,"Sorry, the movie has flaws. Get over it. Please explain to me why they would watch porn in the backseat of a lyft drive. Please explain to me the serial killer scene. Please explain to me them simultaneously emulating dolls when they literally can‚Äôt do that, they‚Äôre brains aren‚Äôt fused. Why the fuck would they experience the same phenomenon? What type of drugs make you emulate dolls. Give me some of that. Please explain to me how a kid can rent a yacht and not use it at all. Please explain how GIGI can teleport. Sorry I‚Äôm not about make excuses for poor writing. It‚Äôs like they just scatter-plotted jokes. ‚ÄúWhat if they ate strawberries and turned into dolls‚Äîwhat if this crazy girl jumped off a yacht and magically dried off and teleported to the main characters next destination‚Äîwhat if they watched porn in the backseat of their lyft driver‚Äôs car, who so happens to their principal‚Äîwhat if our movie made no fucking sense to the amateur, 19-year-old critic.‚Äù Like I said in the original post, the movie was shot well, but the writing is shite.",bs6w7x
eouwu47,"Hey, don‚Äôt get mad at me because you‚Äôre a duck, alright?

You act like a snob, you get treated like one ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

And you are a snob.",bs6w7x
ep7z8n8,"Dang, no doors on stalls sounds TERRIBLE. I would've NEVER taken a dump at school üòÇ but yeah, we've come a long way indeed. Times are changin!",bs6w7x
eouzhj9,"It‚Äôs a COMEDY.

‚ÄúPlease explain to me how an inflatable auto pilot can actually fly a plane.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease explain to me how McLovin gets a fake ID with only one name.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease explain to me how Seth Rogan can sleep with Katherine Heigl.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease explain to me how Happy Gilmore is good at golf.‚Äù

If you‚Äôre looking for hyper realism in your comedic movies, I feel sorry for you, bud.",bs6w7x
