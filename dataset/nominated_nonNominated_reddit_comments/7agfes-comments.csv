Korg was absolutely hilarious. ""Piss off ghost!""

Hemsworth seemed like he was having way more fun with the role in this one than any of his four other appearances.

Hiddleston was reliably slick and suave. Again, his comedy chops were on great display.

Ruffalo, too, felt more free and fun. He was great as Hulk himself.

Tessa stole the show. She was hilarious. And mah gaaaaawd is she hot.

Blanchett and Urban...were Marvel villains. Not as bad as their worst but definitely more to their standard. Guess Vulture was a fluke so far...

Goldblum was fun, however.

The action was cool. Thor vs. Hulk was a legitimately cool fight scene.

Overall it was definitely one of the better Marvel movies, IMO. Nothing incredibly groundbreaking, really, but it was immensely entertaining and had a great visual flair.

Hemsworth is good as Thor. Ruffalo as Bruce Banner is pretty good too. I like the evolution of Hulk's speech pattern and how he and Bruce's dynamic has changed.

Cate Blanchett hams it up here and there as Hela, but was a much better villain than that Dark Elf in Thor 2.

Tessa Thompson is an excellent addition to the Marvel franchise. She worked off of everyone pretty well and had a pretty decent backstory.

I think Hiddleston nails it again as Loki and [I'm pretty happy he didn't die off so we'll see his role in Infinity War (he totally stole the tesseract).](#spoiler)

The Best:

* Very quick-paced and fun to watch

The Worst:

* Villains who are played well by their actors but on the character level aren't that compelling or memorable and whose plans boil down to ruling/destroying everything
* Constant comedy at the cost of drama. There were multiple moments here that should've felt more emotionally impactful, but didn't since the tone of the rest of the movie was so comedic (also because of one of the strengths listed above: this movie moves *so damn fast* through everything, which again, makes it fun to watch and re-watch, but at a cost)

dqz88kx,"I think this is one of the better films from the Marvel universe. I went in with low expectation after seeing that first Thor movie, but **big** improvement in terms of writing. Beyond just the comedy, the film actually did have good character depth and development for an action film. I liked that they gave Hela somewhat legit back story to be angry, and not just a random evil villain who wants to take over the world for unknown reason. They also gave more dimensions to Thor, who has to learn to leave his comfort zone of relying on his hammer, harnessing his title ""God of Thunder"" and generally growing up as a character after his father's death. 

I did enjoy the bits where they tried to close all the little side loopholes and bring everything together, instead of completely ignoring what happened before. For instance, Loki didn't suddenly turn into a good guy, wiping clean what happened in the previous films. You do see a little bit of conflict between the two and distrust of Loki by everyone. They explain the two year gap between the movies and how Hulk got there. I think it did a better job of combining each character's storyline than the Avenger films did. This one really showed that their paths cross occasionally and collaborate, but each Avenger has their own arc.

Overall, good light flick. I think it was definitely worth seeing it in theatres. ",7agfes

I know there was the ""friend from work"" quote from the trailer, but there was so much more. I guess spending the last 5 years with humans has really rubbed off on him.

Ruffalo was yet again, an amazing Banner. I really hope that's not the last time we see him. I enjoyed hearing Hulk speak more too. I found myself being most interested in what he had to say.

I think my favorite part was the look of terror on Loki's face when he first sees Hulk, then his pure elation when Hulk ragdolls Thor. That was a fantastic callback and I loved it so much.

This was leagues above Dark World, which I really disliked. No question, it's my favorite of the Thor trilogy so far, though I still really love the first one, minus the love story.

The tone was great, the visuals were colorful and fanatic. And Doctor Strange just popping in for a quick scene was perfect, exactly like the kind of weird “Oh, of course” cameo you’d find in Marvel’s pages. Those characters cross in and out of each other’s titles all of the time, and we’re finally getting to the point where we can see that onscreen.

DC has claimed to be a “director-first” franchise, but honestly, I think Marvel is evolving to beat them on that front. Waititi’s vision is just so clearly seen here. Marvel did have a formula for a while, but they’ve solidified the audiences’ expectations and now they can play around.

Thor lost his father, lost his eye and his hammer, also lost his friend who die trying to protect his home and then lost his home too even thought he got his adopted-brother back but now he has no where to go.

I love how Thor's character has develop from the first movie. I remember that in the first, he was depending on his hammer like a life saver and he was so lost when he can't pull his hammer out of the ground, he can't even use his own power, they made it like he was nothing without his hammer (That's why I hate it so much)

But in the third, he now learned how to use his own power without the hammer, I love how his father snap him like, are you god of hammer? made him realize that his power is actually Thunder and it has nothing to do with the hammer. To be honest, I wish I could see Thor struggle to use his own power for the first time, it seems too easy in this movie. I mean this is the first time that he use his power without hammer right?

If you’re reading the comics, Thanos and Hela smooched real hard at the end of the Unworthy Thor. All signs point to the Death Thanos is looking court being Hela. She made no bones about who she was in this movie, the Goddess of Death, and a woman capable of being Asgard to its knees has to catch the eye of Thanos.

Additionally, every other MCU villain that has died (with the exception of Red Skull maybe), has been verifiably offed. I noticed when Surtur’s sword ran through her, it looked like the same green smoke that teleported her to Norway at the beginning.

Blanchett was so good in the role, and the Avengers/GotG facing off against the combined might of Thanos and Hela seems like a helluva send off for Phase 3.",7agfes

Saying that, the plot WAS pretty conventional , but - and here's where I had a bit of a problem with the movie - it didn't seem to matter, either to Wahiti or me as a viewer. I never cared what was happening to Thor or Loki or Asgard. It was so self conscious about being absurd and meta that it was really impossible to give a shit. Dramatically, it fell flat. It was basically the polar opposite of 'The Dark Knight' (I've not seen 'Man of Steel' and 'BVS' which I've heard are fairly grim)

dpx5ujh,"I thought Ragnarok was awesome. Solid 8.5/10. Upper third (maybe better) of the MCU. I really didn't mind the comedy, and thought most of it worked really well. That said, the prevalence and the success of the humor in this one and Spider-Man: Homecoming (whose humor I also liked in its own right) has me kinda worried about the future of the MCU. Similarly to how WB decided that BvS must have failed critically because it was ""too dark"" and decided to pump Justice League full of jokes, when that really wasn't the problem to start with, I wonder if Marvel learned the wrong lesson from the first two Thor films and thought, ""These movies weren't well-received because they were too serious,"" when, again, that wasn't the problem. The problem was that they weren't particularly great movies.

What I'm getting at (in this backwards-ass way) is the concern that the studios who make superhero movies are getting the wrong idea of what their movies have to be in order to be critically successful, and therefore financially viable in the long-run. Just because Ragnarok was good and the first two Thor films weren't DOES NOT MEAN that the majority of MCU films need to be comedies (or even have pervasive humor). Personally, I would like Marvel to attempt more emotional resonance and dramatic weight in their upcoming films, foregoing full-on comedy in pursuit of something heavier and more intense. I don't mean to say that I don't want humor in my Marvel (I do, and I've enjoyed the vast majority of it so far), I just don't need every movie to be that, and I like to have some real gut-punches every once in awhile. Doctor Strange is an example of a film that suffered from a little too much subversive humor. I really liked that film too, and even a lot of the humor, but there were times where I wanted it to take itself more seriously. Not every movie should be Logan, but a lot more of them could shoot for that kind of groundedness than there currently are. I trust the Russos pretty well, and I hope they're planning to really bring the emotion and drama in the next two Avengers films. I imagine BP will also be more serious. So that's a bit of comfort to me. I just hope none of them are laugh-fests.",7agfes

* Very standard Marvel fare. Good characters, funny jokes, interesting plot with twists, flawless special effects, excellent fight choreography, cool setting and set pieces, decent villain. Overall this is a good thing but the movie doesn't do anything that makes it stand out in the pack.

* Valkyrie didn't even try to look drunk.

* Thor had great chemistry with Hulk/Banner and Loki.

* Doctor Strange had a very minor role in the movie, in fact I doubt it was in any way crucial.

* There's a joke almost every minute. It's entertaining, but sometimes it subverts genuinely emotional scenes.

* Skurg had a very predictable character arc.",7agfes

dw0519r,"Yes it was a fun movie but I understand some of the hate, the comedy was great but it did seem to encroach on the seriousness of the situation.

Also when Thor loses his thing, towards the end it was so fast it almost felt inconsequential, like [he was supposed to look like his father or something.](#spoiler)

I will say though, Cate looked really good as Hela, especially when she has hair, the stag horn thing was a bit weird and I didn't feel it as much. 

Also I noticed something rather strange about Asgard technology, they are simultaneously more advanced yet more primitive than Humans, we see this in the conversation between Dr Strange and Thor in the beginning. ",7agfes

This one just showed how at odds they are with each other. Two years pass and then Banner wakes up on another planet where this sub-culture has formed around the Hulk and he has no idea what is going on.

What kind of people go to a Thor movie and critique the crap out of it. People like that should look for a Shakesperean phrase at the bottom of a pint of beer. 

Thor is SOOO good on these points:
1.) The style of the movie itself. It really felt like a great saga like the late 70s and early 80s movies. The strongest style I can think of is ""Flash Gordon"". If you LOVE that movie, then THOR is that movie X10. 

2.) The cast is fantastic. For Christ's sake, you have everything in it. You have Odin played by one of the greatest actors of our time. You have a hunky leading man who is every bit of a norse god. Just great to watch start to finish. 

3.) The cameos...there were so many both from a Marvel Universe standpoint and those who actually know what Ragnarok is about. That brings me to my last point.

4.) Given the seriousness of what Ragnarok actually means in Norse, if I had to trudge through a movie that went through one sad point to the next, it would make you realize what the deeper message is, (and it's a depressing one by the way). Which is why I absolutely loved the punch lines. The delivery and timing is so hard to do in a movie and this was keeping things entertaining.

Jeff Goldblum was great. Seeing Thor and Loki again and working together again as I did enjoy Thor Dark World I am glad they were able to grow and mature their relationship... unless Loki betrays Thor and gives the tesseract to Thanos.  Glad they addressed the Easter egg from Thor 1 about that infinity gauntlet with the stones that was in Odin's Vault. The visuals and the score were a lot more memorable too compared to the previous ones. Can't wait to see Dr. Strange 2, he seems much more powerful now. Karl Urban is awesome as always. Hulk was great, but guess we are never getting a more direct live action World War Hulk movie, but that would be hard to do anyway. 

Personal criticisms is that the Warrior 3 kind of just died, Hogun at least lasted a little longer, but the other two died pretty unceremoniously and I was a bit sad they were killed off so quickly. Though I understand it may have messed up the pacing, but I wanted at least a scene for Thor to acknowledge he lost 3 of his best friends, even Loki may have shown some remorse at their deaths as they were all pretty good friends when younger. Especially with the way Hogun body was specifically impaled among the rest of the dead Asgardian warriors. thought it would be a nice scene for Thor to have walked by on his way to face Hela. Even the resseruction of the dead guards under the vault, not sure if her powers could not have enslaved the newly dead that Thor may have had to fight them too. 
Also I knew the actress playing Lady Sif too busy to return, but if her character was in it, I wondered if she would have been slain too. 

Valkyrie was cool and that flashback scene was gorgeous in 3D, reminded me of the Wonder Woman book that Hippolyta used to tell the story of their people. Not sure if it was better the way it was in the film where Hela does not acknowledge or remember knowing who that Valkyrie was or should have been some form of acknowledgment as simple as saying she was gonna extinguish the last of the valkyries. 

Hela mentioned Thor looking like Odin after he lost an eye, but Odin lost an eye after Hela was imprisoned and erased from Asgardian history so how did she know what Odin looked like with the missing eye, unless he visited her. Also kind of wish we saw their mother Frigga or anything about how Hela turned against Odin and them and if Hela ever meant anything to her.  Even a painting of her in that mural would have been nice, unless I missed her in it. 

Loki was great, but overall he feels pretty weak still. His magic was vastly inferior against Dr. Strange, but then again he is the sorcerer supreme, not sure which is stronger. He also lost pretty handily to Valkyrie. Though I guess his true strengths lies in trickery and deceit instead of direct combat where he is still proficient in, just nowhere near the others.  

Also I liked Natalie Portman and bit sad Jane Foster is out of the picture now, but there wasn't really anyway to put her in the script. 

Overall great movie and best Thor movie.

dpa13j5,"Easily one of the funnest MCU movies in a while. I would even put this ahead of GOTG Vol 1 to the extent that some of the action scenes were TRULY EPIC.

Here is how I see it: 

1. How you see the movie comes down to whether you wanted the movie to be thematically similar everything thats comes before. to my mind, their strategy of doing something completely different worked out great!



2. Movie trod on the fine line of not being serious when it had to. In some places I thought the funniness could have been toned down. Having said that, I still laughed, so it doesn't really matter. 


3. Some plot lines / development was random. For example, how did Loki survive? That Valkyrie chick randomly changed her mind like half way. I got that the movie tried to offer a transition, but it was literally 45 minutes of her saying fuck off to Thor, and then one encounter flashback with Loki and 30 seconds later she's like ""the haze has been lifted"". It didn't sell it to me as much. Having said that - she has this weird king of hotness which really stood.

I was disappointed with that. Bruce should have had some internal struggle to come to terms with Hulk too, a ""hey, we need you big guy, but please don't stay permahulk this time"". Banner also never had a payoff to his indecisiveness on Hela. Hulk never spoke to Loki either. I'm quite sad they didn't have a reunion and Hulk didn't stand on the bridge with them like the trailer.

I thought Odin's death was a bit hokey and Hela's entrance I didn't dig too much. I wanted more from her, specifically more on her role as the goddess of Death. Perhaps her return scared the Asgardians because she could bring about permanent death for them, something they hadn't experienced before. Also, no ""Ah, the last of the Valkyrie"" moment from Hela?

I really hope everyone isn't destroyed by Thanos in the beginning of Infinity War. Something tells me Marvel won't have them settle in Norway :(. What an interesting world that would be, a whole civilization of aliens and Asgardians living on Earth.  

Some weird editing at times and I assume some things were cut for time and unfortunately Disney doesn't allow extended cuts so we'll only ever have this decent movie. Best Thor movie and one of my favorite MCU movies overall though despite my quibbles with it.

I do lament the way they casually toss aside the Warriors Three and [Sif is entirely absent without a mention from Thor.](#spoiler) I also feel like Mark Ruffalo was underutilized, his dialogue could have been better and more time could have been spent exploring his pain.

That said, I think it was well-acted, and the comedy was an unusual but entirely welcome addition. Since the first Thor movie it really feels like Thor as humanized and come from a ball of bravado and braggadocio, to a compassionate and empathetic leader.

dpbouvh,I love that Korg looks like The Thing and when he introduced himself he describes himself as a thing.,7agfes
dpbr87k,"That was a lot of fun. I think its biggest strength is that it set out to do a specific thing and it did it. Previous Thor movies have not felt so confident, Thor 2 in particular fell into this weird space of obligation to the MCU more than something that was made with purpose. 

But this was a *goddamned comic book movie* in full effect and with full awareness and reverence to that. It had an identity (mostly) of its own and came to the plate fully ready to swing for the fences. 

If I can go looking for things to be more critical of. The big one is the humor. On the one hand, a lot of the jokes were great, really all of them were in the sense that even if I didn't laugh, someone else was and they still were well executed. On the other hand, the movie didn't know when to lay off, really. As well, many of the jokes had a 'sameness' to them where you just feel like it's the same person's sense of humor being stamped on 12 different characters(AKA Joss Whedon syndrome). The exception being Jeff Goldblum's character and his performance which was perfect, funny and even had a bit of meta at work for how little Goldblum gives a shit about comic books mirroring how little Grandmaster gave a shit about anything. 

There's the usual gripe I have with PG-13 spectacles where just knowing it's a mainstream billion dollar PG-13 movie you already basically know where it has to hold its punches and that makes it harder to get *excited* by it. The biggest example of this was when the random blonde female asgardian was picked out for execution. You 100% know the movie isn't going to let that happen. Seems to me that they shouldn't even write scenes like that into the movie when they know they can't actually show a consequence or impactful/fearful moment. 

But overall, it was still a great spectacle with plenty to enjoy. One thing that stood out to me in particular was that it felt very well paced and scaled. They spent just the right amount of time on Sakaar, with appropriately placed time-outs to let characters talk. 

I think, had Guardians of the Galaxy not already been made and had it not shifted the landscape of mainstream movies so much, this movie would have accomplished the same. As it sits, it's still an example of MCU at its best. ",7agfes

dpafh3j,"I'm a comic book movie fan, so I know what to expect from these movies. I liked it, way more than the previous ones, and I'd still recommend it to other comic book movie fans. But it still felt like ""I've seen this before"", there's nothing about it that stands out to me.

The humour was good for the most part (Korg was hilarious), and the action was ok, but that's pretty much all I have to say about it. Hela looked cool, but she was just the generic ""evil lost sibling who wants what she thinks belongs to her"" kind of villain. The story was predictable, except for the Sultur thing at the end. But even then, you know he was going to appear again, because of the big deal they made of his helmet and the shot of Hulk jumping at him in some trailers. Speaking of trailers, almost every cool scene was shown, all Hulk action scenes where in the trailers. But it was impressive how they tricked us with altered shots, specially the ones where Thor had already lost his eye. It was the only moment of real surprise for me.

And the whole ""Loki pretends to help Thor but then betrays him but not really because now he is kinda good I guess?"" is old already, we had this in every movie he appears! At least it looks like he may finally made his mind, since he came with Thor to earth.

But the thing that bothered me the most was Asgard. Seriously, there are only dozens of people living there? How the fuck do they have a army to protect all nine realms? This is the third Thor movie, and I still think Asgard is dull and lifeless. Sakaar was way more interesting, more fleshed out, it really felt like a ""real"" place where people live. ",7agfes

dpkcjnq,"Now, I might be missing the point of the Marvel movies, but I really was disappointed by this film. Not because it's not a good ""piece of film literature"" because I don't really expect a Marvel movie to be like that. No, I'm really just disappointed because it seemed like they had a comedic movie when it wasn't necessary.

Ever since the success of GOTG, Marvel has been leaning towards comedic movies, which is absolutely fine and I think adds variation to the style of the MCU. The problem arises when they make Thor the comedic one, instead of somebody that makes more sense, like Iron Man or Star Lord. The reason I say Thor doesn't make sense as a comedic character is because of the comedy he employs in Thor: Ragnarok: he's often very goofy at inappropriate times, seems to have low regard for serious situations, and has completely forgone his mission of searching for Infinity Stones. (Remember, one of the last things we saw from Thor was him having a vision of infinity stones and him being SET on finding them; they kind of just throw that aside for the convenience of the plot). All of these things lead to a massive inconsistency with Thor's character development in the MCU; he's never been this absolute goofball character like Tony; he's grounded in reality (with comedic moments, granted), and the humor comes from his seriousness. This movie felt like it disregarded his character arc for the sake of ""making a funny movie""

That being said, the movie was genuinely funny and it achieves its goal as a comedy film. But it's just disappointing because fundamentally, they're not really staying consistent with the rules/qualities they've prescribed to the characters (such as Thor or Hulk). 

Am I missing something?",7agfes

dpii9b4,"Loved Ragnarok! The comedy of the movie seems to be the most controversial part, and I can understand that. At times I thought Thor having a noticeably comedic personality didn't seem right, but I didn't think the comedy was as swing and miss as some people in the comments are suggesting either. 

Anyway, my critique of the movie I'd like to share is that I *really* think that adding flashbacks to Odin and Hela's crusade of the 9 realms showing them defeating other kingdoms/species/whatever would've helped Hela's character. I loved Hela as a villain but it seems like she would've benefited from another scene or two for her backstory. As one commenter explained earlier Hela's introduction was kind of lame with the whole, ""I'm dying, oh, btw you have a sister she's the goddess of death and will conquer Asgard."" thing.

Nonetheless, that raps up my major complaints with the movie. Still loved a lot of things. Thor vs Hulk, Hela, Valkyrie, Loki, Heimdall, Korg, etc.",7agfes

Did I think there was a lot of comedy? Sure, but I had no problems with a more light-hearted Thor, even if it had the grimmest ending out of the previous 3. 

It was weird to have Loki have a character change. Not that I expected him to be a great leader or anything, but what they portrayed was vastly different than what I expected. 

Otherwise, I personally enjoyed this movie, definitely the best Thor in my opinion, but below some of the other good Marvel films like Spider-man Homecoming, Civil War, Iron Man, and Guardians of the Galaxy. But above the other good Marvel films. So I'd put it right above the middle of the line, and I thoroughly enjoyed all of the Marvel movies so far.",7agfes

However, I need to remind people of one thing after seeing this movie. *Don’t talk in movie theaters*. My gf and I went to an AMC and had to pick seats. We ended up next to a 30-ish year old couple who not only converses during key scenes (during the thor/hulk face off and finale) but the girl decided everyone in the theater paid for her commentary as well. When Loki says at the end “here’s your savior” she LOUDLY exclaimed “omg go away”. We got fed up and shushed them 3 times and they continued to talk and she continued to give commentary.

I noticed halfway that a very common joke structure in the movie was taking the big important moments that were common in previous movies, and adding something silly to them. Big important speech? Thor is swinging on chains. Mysterious character appears? She falls down blind drunk. Motivational hero speech? Balls to the face. It always managed to get at least a giggle out of me, but it felt sort of like a comedy supplement at times, like instead of writing a good joke, they could just do their usual stuff, and throw a quick joke at the end.

Still, when it got right, it got it *right*. The interactions between Thor and Hulk were pure gold.

Not to mention that this was straight up a campy space opera, and I absolutely love that. Right down to the excessively colorful sets, the props ripped straight out of an 80s flick, the over the top costumes - the mere fact that there *were* costumes is such a statement already!

And I don't think that Dr Strange or The Hulk were even really even needed in the movie at all and u think it would have been better off like Guardians, doing its own thing.

It's also funny how all of these movies consist of world-threatening threats happening primarily in America and they have to tip-toe around having heroes and SHIELD running into each other.  Then Thor runs into the Hulk on a random planet neither of them have ever heard of.",7agfes

dpy9tzc,"Honestly, too much happened in too little time. Every scene should've been twice as long.

Give me more with Surtr.

Give me more than 10 seconds to feel the impact of Odin's death before you move on to the next plot point of Hela arriving.

Give me more than a single fucking gladiatorial fight that ends ambiguously. Hell, give me 3 warmup fights before Thor gets to fight the champion. This was the most we're ever getting of Planet Hulk, I at least want a few good fights.

Give Hela more actions sequences. She literally defeated all of Asgard's forces in a single fight.

Final act was pretty forgettable, probably because it was so rushed. Only thing I remembered was the rock dude making a joke about the fall of Asgard.

Jesus.

Ragnarok was fun, it was funny, it had fantastic CGI - but it felt tonally inconsistent (jokes all over the place while very serious things were happening), and. too. much. was. crammed. into. too. little. time. This could've been fantastic if every scene was doubled in length.",7agfes
duexwgy,"Some things about this movie annoys me as a Norwegian. The ""Haha, It's great that there's female valkyries, about time!"" line makes no sense. Valkyries have been a part of Norse mythology before Christianity was a thing in Norway. Why would Thor awkwardly joke about that?

And why is the valkyrie black? And Heimdal for that matter. I mean, I love the portrayal of Heimdal, or I would if it was just another fantasy movie, but if a movie about African gods made some of them white, what would the reaction be? 

I probably wouldn't care about these things if the mythology wasn't part of my heritage, but it is. I've also found myself growing more cynical, so I might just be latching onto what should be a passing thought. 

Still thought the movie was great overall though. The biblical shot of the valkyries fighting Hela took my breath away, and a surprising amount of the humor landed for me, especially New Zealand Rock man. Idris Elba killed it as always.

dpk3wke,"Saw it yesterday in IMAX 2D. First impressions:

* New Marvel logo intro was slick
* [Seeing Thor bound at the beginning felt like a Mission Impossible/James Bond kind of intro. The line, ""I know what you're thinking..."" was perfect.](#spoiler)
* Right from the get go until the end of the film, this felt more like a comedy than an action adventure. It felt like each actor was trying to one up the other with a funnier quip.
* It felt like the actors were just being themselves on camera, but dressed up like Marvel superheroes.
* Chris Hemsworth should do more comedies. He's very good at mannerisms, line delivery and reacting to other actor's dialogue and actions.
* [Kor's voice with Thor at the beginning made me feel this film was setting a new direction where Marvel is going to be more comedic than action.](#spoiler)
* This film was all about Thor. Every other character, even those who had larger roles in the first two films, were very minor.
* [Wished for more Loki screen time.](#spoiler)
* [Film felt it centered more around Thor and Hulk/Bruce Banner than Thor and Loki](#spoiler)
* [Dr Strange cameo was cool to see, but, it felt out of place as far as Odin was concerned.](#spoiler)
* [Karl Urban's character was flat and unmoving. Felt nothing when he joined Hela, then later saved those people and turned against her. His acting was far superior in Star Trek. Although, it was boss to see him grab ""Des"" and ""Troy"" and use them for real to wipe out some of Hela's soldiers.](#spoiler)
* Idris Elba was boss as Heimdall.
* [Matt Damon cameo was hilarious because the camera work didn't reveal him right away.](#spoiler)
* [Disappointed that Sif wasn't in it.](#spoiler)
* [Disappointed that Volstagg and Fandral had a super short scene. They seemed more like extras than regular cast.](#spoiler)
* [Thor and Loki's help scene was hilarious because of the dialogue setting up the action.](#spoiler)
* [Point break reference was flat. I see what the director was trying to do with that line but, it felt weak when Thor said it.](#spoiler)
* [Banner jumping out of the ship and not changing into the Hulk when he landed on the bridge was the funniest thing I've seen in a Marvel movie.](#spoiler)
* Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie was just bad ass. Right kind of attitude with a bit of subtle sexiness to boot.
* Speaking of sexiness, Cate Blanchett was Hela fine!
* [Speaking of Hela, though Cate crushed that role, her character felt shoe-horned in. Not enough time was spent on her origin (there should have been references to her in earlier films). The way Odin suddenly tells Thor and Loki there's a sister felt flat. Then seeing Hela destroy that ceiling revealing Odin and Asgard's true state was mediocre. Her character arc felt rushed.](#spoiler)
* Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster was just him being himself. It was as if Taika turned the camera on and told Goldblum to say whatever comes to mind. Funny stuff!
* [Speaking of funny stuff, the rock creature had some of the funniest lines. His lines were so random, but so perfectly delivered.](#spoiler)
* [I saw only the first Ragnarok trailer. It made me feel this film was going to be grander and more epic than the last two. Didn't get any sense it was going to be overly funny. While watching the film and at the end when Asgard was destroyed, it felt like a comedy rather than some grand adventure story.](#spoiler)
* There's not one scene in this one that stands out like in the first two films. For me, Thor trying to take the hammer out of that compound, him changing into ""Thor"" and destroying the Destroyer, the epic picture score were huge in the first film. Then, him collaborating with Loki and taking out Malekith, Loki's shenanigans (that Capt America scene!) were highlights of the second film. [Ragnarok didn't have that epic picture score or any scene that stood out.](#spoiler)
* It just felt like a two hour comedy sketch where the actors were just being themselves. Nothing wrong with that because I enjoy a good comedy. 
* Overall, as a comedy, it's a 8/10. For action adventure, a 6/10.

I may be in the minority for this opinion but tbh I didn’t really like Valkyrie and the drinking/alcoholic attitude seemed really forced.

dpa693s,"That was a damn good movie man. I had a blast. I wouldn't say its *""The best MCU movie or the funniest MCU ever!""*. 

**THE PROS:**

1. Chris Hemsworth/Thor. In the first two Thor movies, Thor was pushed to the back because the supporting characters were much more interesting, but here its different; I actually gave a shit about Thor and his quest because the filmmakers gave me more of a reason to. There was no hamfisted love story that weighed the movie down, nope. It was just Thor trying to save his people. And it was great. 

2. The soundtrack. Holy shit. It was so surprising to hear such a great composed score in an MCU film. Aside from *Captain America: The First Avenger*, there really wasn't a great MCU score, but now we've got two. I loved the synth theme, and the music really pulled me into the action. 

3. The supporting heroes. Valkaryie, Loki & Hulk were all great in the film (all though you could make an argument that Hulk didn't need to be in this movie other than to tie up loose ends and pull in more tickets) but they were all fun, and they didn't overshadow the main character. 

4. The humor. For the most part the humor was really funny. Laughed my ass off when Hulk entered the arena and Loki freaked out. Brilliant stuff there. 

5. The pacing. This really surprised me. This movie flew by because it was so well directed and tightly edited; the previous two movies (*especially Thor: The Dark World*) had some rough patches where they just dragged, but not *Ragnarok*. This is how you pace a Thor movie, you guys. 

And of course....

6. Jeff Goldblum. Yeah, his time was very brief but there's no denying how entertaining he was during that short span of time. 

**THE CONS**

1. Hela. It seems like a reoccurring thing with MCU movies, but the main villain here was woefully undeveloped...again. Though you could tell Cate was having fun with her role, her character was just thinly written. I felt like there was so much potential surrounding Hela that they pushed aside her development for the sake of throwing in a bunch of jokes. The film needed **more** of the Thor vs. Hela dynamic and it would've been much better. But her storyline was supposed to be the heart of Thor's journey right? Wasn't that supposed to help Thor become the God of Thunder that we all know and love? Point is, they could've done wayyy better. 

2. Odin. [The scene where Odin dies was so rushed it was laughable. I get it was supposed to be the catalyst for Thor to discover his inner powers but come on man. Try a little harder. I know it would've been a little cliched to have Hela kill Odin, but it would've made more sense for her and the story if she had done so rather than just have Odin turn to gold dust after 2 minutes of screen time. Cheap, lazy, and didn't have the full effect.](#spoiler)

Overall it has its flaws, its not the best MCU movie, but it was a damn fun time, and so far #4 for me in the Superhero race behind *Logan, Wonder Woman, & Spider-man*. Better than Guardians 2 and it'll more than likely be better than Justice League.

**7.8/10 for me.** ",7agfes
dpa8xbo,"As much as I loved Cate Blanchett as Hela, every time I saw her on screen I wanted her to be Eva Green.  I think she would have fit that role even better.",7agfes
dparrko,"I'll preface this by saying that I generally dislike action and comedy movies. I've never heard of Waititi before. I had watched the trailer for this movie the day it was released, but I didn't remember most of it when I walked into the theater. One fact I did remember was that Thor would engage Hulk in a gladiatorial combat. That's it.

---

**The good parts:** 

This movie is hilarious. Waititi seemed like to have a great sense of comedic timing. Around 80% of the jokes landed well for me, whereas for normal comedy movie only ~50% would make me laugh. The ones that got the heartiest laugh out of me were the snake-transforming Loki and the 'Get Help!' routines. Definitely would recommend watching this film if you are a fan of comedy movies.

I also love the fact that Thor didn't physically beat Hela. I love it when heroes are clever and found ways to defeat the villains by exploiting their weaknesses and defeating their ideology. One complaint I got on Wonder Woman was that on a movie discussing the topic of **human** capabilities of doing evil and violence, the conclusion was decided by having two **deities** facing each other on a violent slugfest. I'm glad that Thor defeated Hela by identifying the things that *truly matters*, rather than going on that physical-slugfest-between-deities route.

---

**Now on to the scathing review:**

None of the dramatic moments landed. I didn't feel anything when I watched the death of Odin even as Thor was unconsciously calling thunderclouds. The movie didn't take any time exploring the effect of his father's death upon Thor's psyche. It moved from beat to beat without giving the audience time for stuff to sink into the mind, preferring quick bursts of comedy and action. A good drama and character moments *needs* time, but this movie didn't want to set aside those times. Waititi sacrificed drama for comedy.

The last time we saw Hulk was in Avengers 2, where he went off-radar. Time and again, we were presented with a Banner who struggled to contain the Hulk within him. With Natasha, those two psyches seemed to reach a compromise. Knowing that Black Widow wasn't in this movie, I had looked forward on how Marvel would handle Banner's character progression. And boy oh boy, how much do I think they botched it.

Picture yourself in Banner's shoes, having a monster inside of you who ruined any kind of normal life you had. Now picture yourself as having no memories of the last two years of your life, waking up in a strange world with barely any person you knew—confused, dizzied, and estranged from your life on earth. The other guy had taken the helm for such a long time, you can't be sure that the next time he comes out you would be able to resurface again. 

Now picture yourself being in that plane above the rainbow bridge. Innocents are being slaughtered, your companions are fighting for their lives, and the guns you shoot seems to do nothing to help any of them. Except there's *one thing* you can do to help. You can let the other guy come out and subsume your *self*. A heroic sacrifice to save your friends and the life of the innocents. Surely it was a worthy sacrifice...

Except that your sacrifice was treated as a joke.

Banner jumping off that plane was a huge character moment for him. It shows that even as lost as he was, he's still able to do the right thing and he can't stand by doing nothing when lives are on the line. Yet for all that the movie shied away from showing the true gravitas of that jump. Based on all the jokes Waititi was throwing at us, I actually suspected that the movie would play the scene like it did when the music swelled up as Banner was going to jump. Still, I was genuinely *mad* when they played it as comedy. My goodwill towards the movie suddenly vanished.

The phrase ""Asgard is its' people"" also didn't land well. For all the previous movies, Asgard was presented as an otherworldly city with picturesque landscape and alien customs. We were never given the time to truly know the people of Asgard. Even when the movie showed wounded and dead Asgardians, I can't help but to feel nothing. I simply cannot comprehend the stakes of the battle because those Asgardians might as well be cardboards for me. 

A simple remedy I thought of would be for Thor to enter Asgard during the beginning of the movie by flying to the outskirt of the city and then walked to the palace, rather than flying directly to the palace. This way, we can have some interaction with the Asgardians; how they live, the smile of the children, the cacophony of people living their everyday lives. Waititi could even insert some jokes in that scene—I'm sure that his comedic sense would give us a funny yet still endearing introduction to Asgard.  

---

All in all, this is probably my least favorite of the Marvel movies, even though most of it came down to my dislike of the action-comedy genre. In all honesty, this film has never attempted to be something it was not. The first five minutes gave away on what type of movie it was going to be. If you don't like the first five minutes, chance are that you won't like this movie. I just happen to not like those five minutes.",7agfes
dpdjkrv,"Pros:

Loki- I've been in love since the first film, and his character is the *only* reason I continue the Thor/Avenger  movies. I enjoy him. Hiddleston is brilliant in the role. A mark of a good actor is when their face is a canvas for their emotions, and I've always felt Hiddleston brought that.  Also on a shallow note my lady boner was in overdrive something fierce. I don't find Hiddleston attractive as himself, but my god he is damn delicious as Loki. His long raven hair, thin frame, and that damn black suit in particular was doing things to me oh god lol.

Thor- Chris just keeps owning the role. That is all.

Chemistry- Thor/Banner. Thor/ Val. Loki/Val. Hela and everyone she has a convo with lol. My favorite moments are of course between the brothers though. Some highlights of every film are when Hemsworth and Hiddleston are on screen together.

Graphics- Asgard was still beautiful as usual. The Valkyrie against Hela was breathtaking. Thor's true power was nice to look at, and Asgard blowing up was also a visual treat.

Banner- his whole where the dafuq am I freakouts were endearing and amusing.

Surtar- I liked his design. All that fire...

Hela- badass as hell and played perfectly by Blanchett.  I loved her. She reminded me strongly of a way more evil  Loki. She definitely felt more like his sibling then Thor's. Even down to her costume and hair. 
Also black hair suits you Cate. Keep that.

Val -another badass. I liked her. I also thought her small bro/sis thing with the hulk was kind of amusing.

The rock thing was likable.

Earth being a 10 minute footnote. Freaking thank you. You're learning Marvel. Thor movies should have never been on earth to begin with. Our blue marble has always been the source of strongly uninteresting and comedic heavy scenes,and I'm not at all sad to see them go.  Leave the earth crap to the Avenger team ups.

Cons:

The comedy was to much. Just to much. Holy shit. The movie is supposed to be about the *apocalypse* and yet it felt like Guardians of the Galaxy: Thor Edition full stop. Tension and emotional impact of everything was *nonexistent*. Sultar has you tied up and says he will destroy your planet? Time for some jokey jokes. Thor's friends die or he finds out his brother is still alive?  Insert Comedy here. Odin dies? Meh. Loki is sympathetic,but is still a *mass murderer* of two planets etc? Water under the bridge apparently. Hela is a *complete monster* going on a rampage  through your world? Time for more jokes of course. Asgard blows up? Definitely time for another zinger or two. I mean damn. This is the *end of days* happening here, and the movie was *completely* tone deaf to that fact.  This is an issue with most of their films. There is such a thing as balance. Find it. 

Thor's reunion with Loki - I love me some Hemsworth and Hiddeston sharing screen time,but good lord this was not the execution and tone that should have went down with it. It was forced, fast-paced, unemotional and comedic.I was not pleased.

There was this odd out of characterness to the portrayals of the established cast. I expect them all falling on the sword of comedy had something to do with it.

Loki is the worst sorcerer I have ever seen. I've been waiting for this magical prowess he's supposed to have going on four films now. I'm still waiting. 

It felt like two different movies were fighting for supremacy. The wacky high jinks of the junk yard planet, and then the real story on Asgard.Emotional gravitas be dammed for both.  

The hulk- I've never been a fan. Too superman for me and stupid. I hate overpowered invincible characters. I do adore Banner though.

Soundtrack- I don't know what was going on here. It fit the comedic tone of the film,but that's actually the problem. This movie and its score should have never been a comedy to begin with.

Was I entertained? Sure. *Technically* I can't deny that. However, in a movie about the *apocalypse* was I *emotionally* invested to anybody or anything? Nope.",7agfes
dph054r,"I found [Thor: Ragnarok](http://manapop.com/film/thor-ragnarok-2017-review/) to be one of the best action comedy buddy fantasy films to date.

Stray Thoughts:

* Doctor Strange is not someone you’d like be on the bad side of.

* We get to experience just what an evil Galadriel would be like.

* Now that we’ve seen how well an evil female villain can be handled how about we get The Enchantress next?

* The Hulk may be physically stronger than Thor but the thunder god is easily the better fighter.

* Naked Hulk…yikes!

* As good as this movie is it's a shame it also means we'll never get an actual ""Planet Hulk"" movie.",7agfes
dpmnt79,"So, I really loved the film, thought the characters were great, loved the villains and overall a lot more fun than the previous two Thor movies, particularly Dark World. 

However, and I know I'll probably end up crucified for this...

One major instance of the humor really didn't work for me. Most of it landed just fine and felt like typical MCU banter, but toward the very end, when [Asgard is destroyed, Korg makes some comment about how the foundations were still there, and then backpedals really awkwardly when it blows up. It feels really out of place for what is otherwise a genuinely sad scene, and given how huge of a deal it is, I feel it should've been played straight. Even GotG Vol. 2 put on the joke breaks for a certain death at the end, so I feel like they maaaaybe should've dialed it back just a tad. Korg was great otherwise, but this one part felt like it would've been better played seriously.](#spoiler)

dpbdbtr,"I thought it was fun and entertaining. I'm in the camp that is burned out of the standard Marvel formula, so I enjoyed the silly tone more than a lot of others here seemed to. I liked that Waititi brought the character arcs of Thor and Loki full circle, just hope that the next Avengers doesn't fuck all that up and ignore the great character work that was done here. I felt the second half was much stronger than the first, which was bogged down by a lot of exposition from people like Odin and Doctor Strange. The finale was great and made a lot of the set up from earlier in the film worth it since everything paid off rather well. Not the best movie out there, but certainly one of the more memorable Marvel ones of the last few years.

Ninja edit: Also, Blanchett was wasted in another bland villain role. Goldblum was a much more entertaining antagonist.",7agfes
dpbjx0c,"Though kind of similar in tone to Guardians films, I think this movie is better. A big part of this is because the action scenes never get too jokey and are genuinely well done. There is either a real sense of danger or are just moments of badassness. Guardians to me has a lot of moments where the action will feel undercut, but here it was fully engaging. When Thor goes full God of Thunder on Hela its a genuinely badass moment and feels earned. To me this is something Marvel should take note of, I feel like the Winter Soldier and Civil War did this as well. There would be a few jokes or quips in non action scenes but for instance when Bucky is on the run in Germany there aren't any jokes in that. This did well with that too. ",7agfes

He pushed the story along but wasn't necessarily essential to it either.

Marvel excels when its light hearted with likeable characters.  It still suffered a bit from some usual problems with Marvel films, mainly the fact that the antagonist was very traditional and dull, (though Cate Blanchett gave a good performance) and it stuck to a similar story formula. 

Otherwise, it was a fun, funny film that I'd put up with GOTG, Iron Man 1, The Avengers and Spiderman Homecoming as the better of the Marvel films. ",7agfes

The action was very well done to IMO. Everything was able to be followed while you felt the impact of it all. Which is hard to do with god-tier beings running around punching and throwing each other. There were more than a few times I had a verbal “holy shit” moment. Definitely a fun movie overall. 

I do feel that the movie ran a little long and the third act was rushed but it seemed worth it since we basically know the outcome even if we didn’t know how they’d pull it off. The first and second act was where the movie shines to me. 

Can’t wait to see where they go with Thor’s story from here since he’s likely in the MCU after Infinity War. 

Top tier MCU movie to me. Top 5-7 for me. 

On another note, I wonder if/how they’d bring Mjilnor back. If not, I’m ok with The Lord(ha) of Thunder wrecking shit with lightening bolts for the foreseeable future in the MCU. ",7agfes

dpa83wd,"I worked a private screening of the premiere and got to see the movie as a result in an amazing cinema.

The trailers were about as honest as they could get without being too spoilery of what to expect from the movie.

I love how it opened up with the ""You're probably wondering how I ended up here"" gag just like the trailer opened up with, and the whole fight that followed was really cool

Thor was finally allowed to be the god that he is in this film, and not the nerfed crap we saw before. Yeah comics Thor is still stronger but this is scores better in terms of him being legit op

Everyone's mentioned their love for Korg, which is well deserved, so I'll just leave that his interaction with Loki was the best moment for me. First he rescues Loki and then Loki does his Loki thing and tries to regain his lost pride by presenting himself to be the hero, and while most would have been irritated by Loki's grandstanding, Korg's so wonderfully simple that he just saw him as an ally immediately. <3

I really like how they went meta with how Loki never changed and how it was getting a bit too predictable with him trying so hard to be evil. The fact he got a legitimate character growth arc in this film alongside Thor was lovely. I easily can see this coming into play in Infinity War. I just as much liked that Thor stopped falling for his bs, and had pretty effective countermeasures to the illusions

And of course I'd be remiss without praising Jeff Goldblum for fully embracing the meme image of himself. Both a satisfyingly threatening villain and an enjoyable character who sorta defied a few classic evil overlord tropes

There were two things I had a problem with. Pacing was off at times and felt a bit slow (moreso in the first half). Also, the jokes during dramatic parts were a bit much.

- Where does Hulk get his pants when he goes from Banner to Hulk? They made it a point that Tony's pants were too tight. 

- The hairdressers on Saakar either put wire in the styles, or they have magic hairspray.

dpigfhw,"This is probably my third favourite Marvel movie to date, with Iron Man 1 and Guardians 1 superseding it because I feel like those movies executed on their stories a lot better. But otherwise I thought this movie was great fun, very witty, very well put together and pretty fantastically written movie.

Good:

* I like how Marvel / Marvel's composers (Mark Mothersbaugh here) are finally reusing musical themes. I mean, I don't know Patrick Doyle's Thor 1 theme or Brian Tyler's Thor 2 themes off the top of my head, but I did notice that they were credited in the credits. So that's good. What I did notice was that Mothersbaugh brought back the harpsicord when Dr. Strange showed up, which I appreciated. Overall his music in this movie is pretty good, really evocative of 80's synth pop kind of stuff.
* The comedic timing was super on point. Marvel movies will typically have a token joke here and there, just enough to keep the movie from being dark in anyway. But this movie was a straight up science fiction comedy, and I loved that aspect of it. It went full hog on the comedy route and nailed it.
* Korg was the best character, but all the actors gave great performances.
* Visually this might be the best Marvel movie (I'd have to think about it.) But just watching this movie so much of it is ""wow, that's awesome."" I don't think I would be able to say that about any other Marvel movie. The sequence where the Valkyries attack Hela was bloody awesome. I'd frame that on my wall.

Bad:

* Maybe this is just me, but I thought the fights ranged from ""above mediocre"" to just bad. And it's not one aspect that really makes me feel that way for every fight, but most fights have something about them that's off. The Thor/Hulk fight and the Loki/Valkyrie fight (the one in the hallway) I think were exceptions to this, those both looked great. But things like the opening fight in ""hell"" looked CG'ed all to hell and the rapid camera movements made it even more apparent. This continued for nearly every other fight scene, some aspect of it just looks... fake. It kind of bugged me.
* I think they should have saved Immigrant Song just for the final battle. I think playing it in the first fight of the movie was a mistake. But that's just me.

Overall a well made, technically competent movie. And the soundtrack rocks.

[Too lazy to read version](https://youtu.be/fo7kEVGJtrM), aka I made a video version.",7agfes
dpolvd1,"Finally got to see it, my thoughts:

Pros:

* I loved all of the color and the synth music. It made this film really stand out from the other MCU films.
* The comedy was good for the most part. Funniest parts were Thor hitting himself with the ball, Banner hitting the bridge, Odin's ""oh shit,"" and Thor's snake story.
* Loki is still my favorite MCU villain to date and he did not disappoint. He's definitely going to do something with the tesseract and I can't wait to see how things turn out. Off topic but I'm surprised no one in New York recognized the world's most infamous terrorist walking around the streets (especially since he was in custody in a public park at the end of the Avengers, and someone could've easily taken a picture of him at the time).
* I liked how there wasn't a typical happy ending, with Thor losing his eye and Asgard getting destroyed.
* It was a fun ride in general. I can't really describe it, but everything else from the small bits to the big fights were very enjoyable.

Cons:

* I feel like the comedy took away from some good parts of the film. GotG and Civil War had a lot of comedy but they also had some very serious moments. The closest thing to that in Ragnarok was Odin's death, but aside from that the stakes felt very low. A lot of MCU films have been doing this recently, but hopefully that changes in Infinity War.
* I hated how there were a lot of cut-aways, like when Thor is going to get hit by Hulk then it just cuts to a completely different scene. Same thing happened when Valkyrie was going to punch Loki and when Thor was about to clash with Hela.
* Cate Blanchett did good as Hela, but like most MCU villains her motivations were very weak (""my vision is power, because I'm a bad person!""). It was interesting that she was connected to Odin, but I wish they built her motives more around being rejected by Odin instead of her pointless ""vision.""
* Skurge felt very out of place. You could cut all of his scenes and nothing would change.
* When Skurge got stabbed, the scene cut to him with the blade already in his chest which looked really fake.
* Thor's friends (Volstagg and the others) should've gotten better deaths. They had fairly big roles in the first two films, but then they just got killed off like they were nothing.

dpavgi9,"wrote this before, guess ill repost it now

As a fan of both Hunt of the Wilder people and What we do in the shadows, I found Thor to be a fun and humorous movie.

However, one big issue I had with the movie was that... it felt really shallow.

Not just the plot, but the characters too. There was nothing beneath the surface. Jeff Goldblum's character was zany, but that's the entirety of his character, and I felt he was underutilized.

Likewise, while they did spend too much time on trash planet Sakaar, that wasn't the problem I had with it. It was that the whole subplot, other than recruiting Loki, Vakyrie and Hulk, was not relevant to the main story at all. It felt like filler. It felt like they needed to shoehorn Planet Hulk into the movie and figured this was the best way to reunite Hulk back into the MCU.

What I mean is, they could have replaced that planet with any other, reduced the length of their stay, and the movie would still have suffered no less.

Compare this to the kidnapping subplot of Ironman. Tony gets kidnapped, forced to build weapons, but builds a suit and an arc reactor instead to escape his captors. But the reason that subplot was memorable wasn't because of it being his origin story of why he built a suit, but because of how Tony completely evolved as a person through this ordeal.

Yinsen lost his family indirectly due to Stark, yet did not hesitate to help him escape. His sacrifice, and his last words, ""My family is dead, Stark... and I'm going to see them now. It's okay, I want this... I want this."" made Tony understand just how much suffering he had indirectly caused with his reckless and irresponsible business actions, and is the impetus for him to become a better man.

The reason I'm disappointed in Thor, is that I feel like that they could have easily added some depth to the Sakaar subplot, in order to have the same character growth for Thor.

We already knew that the origin of Asgard is not a noble one. That they enslaved countless and purged countless more in their conquest before Odin changed his mind and wanted to become a peaceful king.

They could have worked this into Sakaar easily in order to give Thor some character development and tie it to the main plot.

Imagine this tiny adjustment/addition to the backstory of the planet in order to add a lot more depth to it.

That the planet Sakaar was the first realm the Asgardians invaded and conquered during their rise in power. That the gladiator fights were first conceived by the Asgardians to determine who on this planet gets to become a part of their army/slaves, and who dies. And that Odin/Hela forced Jeff Goldblum to organize these fights and mockingly gave him the name ""The Grandmaster"", and in his grief of what he was forced to do and what he had done, he loses his mind and adopts this zany personality in order to cope with his guilt.

Not only would this add depth to Goldblum's character, but it would add another layer of irony that Thor, the son of Odin, is now forced to fight in the same gladiator fights that his family forced onto others.

Have Thor understand that Asgard was not as noble as he thought it was through his experiences on the planet, instead of... looking at a ceiling for 3 seconds.

And so when he does bring upon Ragnarok at the end, it would have more meaning too. It wasn't just that it was okay to blow it up ""because Asgard isn't a place, its where its people are"", but because it would also be an act of atonement for the atrocities his race have committed, cleansing Asgard of its sins of the past, instead of covering it up.

I don't know. Maybe it would have been too cliche? But at least it would add a little more depth to the story.

My friend said: ""if you take away the humor of this movie, what do you have left?"" and I really wondered about it. It felt as if this movie was a comedy first, and everything else moved onto the sidelines.

Not to discredit the director Peyton Reed, ( he's made one of my favorite phase 2 movies and I cannot wait to see The Ant-Man and Wasp) but I just wish Marvel let directors give their own spin on things earlier.

* If Thanos is the one stopping the Asgardian ark, where do they end up by the time Infinity War hits? All of that Act III resolution lost for what the leaked Infinity War trailer reveals would be disappointing. 

* Cate Blanchett killed it. First MCU big bad since Loki in Avengers who actually acted like it (Her talent level helps. A lot.). Alternate take: Hela is what Galadriel would be if she took her ring from Celebrimbor and twisted it to lord over death in Middle Earth.

* Sif's absence was painfully noticeable. 

* The Matt Damon cameo was a nice surprise. However, it distracted me from the fact that Sam Neill was playing Odin in the play. They even tried to help the audience when he took off his eyepatch!

* Sir Anthony Hopkins got to act like a goofy pleasure-seeking Caesar for once instead of always being stately. It was out of character for Odin, and that made it uncomfortably fun. It also gave Odin's death scene more weight.

Some things left me asking questions though, like Thor didn't get his hammer back by the end, so will he ever get it back? Or do you think he'll just go super saiyan from now on?

It was probably explained in the movie but I can't recall; how did Thor end up where he did at the start? (with Surtr). Did ""Odin"" send him there?

Loki took a glance at the Tesseract when he was reviving Surtr. What are the chances he took it with him? They wouldn't show that for no reason right?

Don't get me wrong, it was a bombastic time. Direct comparisons are obviously being drawn to Guardians of the Galaxy, and I'll use that as the counterpoint of my criticism of Thor: Ragnarok.

I think from a visual and imaginative stand-point, the movies are on par with each other. Everything was bright and drew you in, even the scrap world Thor ends up in had its own life to it. Much like with GotG, I found myself believing these places were real, fully invested in their ambience. The action was also fantastic. The moments where Thor was channeling lightning were a visual feast. Much like with GotG, none of it felt gratuitous, or without reason. Which brings me to the humor, and this is where the movie starts to fall apart for me.

It's not that the humor was bad. In fact, I found myself laughing quite often, but I feel like it was just grossly overused. Whereas a movie like GotG used humor really effectively to endear you to its characters, the humor in Thor: Ragnarok has no real reason to be there beyond well, just being there. But more than anything, it's the fact that there's so much of it. The movie grabs its humor baton and just beats you over the head with it over and over. So much so that it just pulled me out of any form of emotional investment I may have had. Never for a second did I feel like Thor was upset over the loss of Odin, which from an emotional stand point was really the only thing in the film we could latch onto; Thor's pain over losing his father. Neither did I ever really feel invested in the fate of Asgard. Rather than feel Thor's urgency and apprehension, I felt his puppy-like excitement to go off and be a hero to his people. And at the climax where Thor hangs his head in defeat, unable to see a way out of their predicament, that was probably the first time I felt like he even began to wrestle with the thought of being inadequate. The loss of his hammer never really had any repercussions up to that point... and then he gets his massive power-up, so yeah, so much for that bit of character development. Oh, and remember when the warriors three were wiped out, almost as an afterthought? Well that was neat. Here, let me take you back to Thor so he can quip you out of giving a damn. Because he sure as shit won't give one. That was probably one of the biggest crimes of the movie, the fact that they would kill off Thor's closest friends, and he doesn't even mourn them! He is never given the chance to. The movie's so busy trying to be a fun romp, it forgets the value of an emotional connection. This is where it fails, this is where GotG succeeded. I mean, just look at Denarian Saal's death in GotG. Sure, nobody in the theater was crying for the guy, but you felt something as Ronan's ship smashed its way through the Nova Corps blockade and Rocket looked on in anger and disbelief. We never really got those moments with Thor: Ragnarok.

You know, Thor: The Dark World may have been a flawed film, but I still found myself caring. Frigga's funeral is still one of the most emotional, beautiful scenes in all of the MCU. I compare that to Odin's death, a dull affair book ended by jokes and a poorly paced, non-sensical introduction to the villain (if she was sealed in Asgard, why did she appear on Earth!?), and I shed a tear. Not out of any emotional investment, but because Odin deserved more. The warriors three deserved more. Hell, Mjolnir deserved more. This entire movie deserved more.

Thor: Ragnarok is bright, colorful, fun and humorous. But in all that bombastic wonder, it forgets to invest the viewer in its story, and thus loses a fair bit of its potential heart.

It's a lot of fun. I just feel like it the pieces were there for it to be so much more, but they went for the easy laughs instead.

dpa2g5w,"Thor 3 is basically just ' What We Do in Shadows' ... but with Marvel characters.

I enjoyed it....but it bothered me.
  
 The characters were not tonally consistent with the previous movies and they all spoke dialogue that felt scripted and not like things that the character would say naturally (which is seriously weird when non-human Asgardian characters use phrases that are earth based...ie; why would Thor, a god, use the phrase 'Oh my god' ). All the characters sound like the writer is writing all their dialogue to be *funny* with no regard for difference in characterization or background.

Its movies like these where I miss the Russo brothers and Joss Whedon ;  They definitely have a specific *writer* voice in their dialogue , but they are capable of writing dialogue that fits the individual character.

Thor is something out of Shakespeare, and his humor reflects that.   Banner is a introvert, trying always to not call attention to himself; when he is funny, which is rare,  the jokes are not showy.  Stark is witty and wants everyone to know it.  Steve tells dad jokes or unintentional jokes.  Black Widow is all about dark  humor. 

Everyone in the 2 Avengers films, Winter Soldier or Civil War has their own voice and own joke style(or lack thereof);  but in this movie everyone tells/is involved with Flight of the Conchord-esque jokes.

dpbl6ff,"Honestly, I was a little disappointed. 

Full transparency: Thor is probably my least favorite Avenger. His first two movies rank at the bottom of the MCU in my opinion, along with *the Incredible Hulk*. But I was so excited for this one because of the reviews. Do I think it's the best MCU film like Rotten Tomatoes implies with it's score? Absolutely not. It's probably in the bottom half for me.

Having said that, it's not a bad film. The MCU has not made a bad film yet. It's actually enjoyable and a lot of fun. I think where my problem lies with it was almost *too* funny for me. And tonally, I felt like it was too different from Thor's first two films; I almost feel like they were trying too hard to be like *Guardians of the Galaxy*. And as a fan of the comics, I expected an event like Ragnarak to make for a darker film; or at least one played a little more seriously. My other big complaint is the editing in the first half-an-hour or so until Hela sent them to Sakaar seemed jumpy and all over the place. And the stuff on Sakaar eclipsed the Ragnarak part of the plot for me, which irked me. Like, that seemed to be the main thrust more than the end of Asgard. And I felt like both Karl Urban and Idris Elba were wasted in this film.

Having said that, there's *so much* good in this film. 

In my opinion, Hela is probably the best/my favorite MCU villain thus far after Loki. Cate Blanchett is amazing in the role - deliciously evil. And I'd love to see her show up again in another film. (Fingers crossed she takes on the role of ""Lady Death"" in the *Infinity War* movies!)

And while the movie is a little too funny in my opinion, all the humor lands. Hemsworth has such great comedic timing, I hope he gets more comedy roles in the future. (Loved the constant use of Black Widow's ""Sun's getting real low"" whenever he tries to calm the Hulk/Banner!) And I loved the work Hiddleston and Ruffalo - both of whom are always great - did in this film as well. (Even if talking Hulk - which I get is supposed to be an evolution of the character - seems almost too childish and kid-friendly in the movie.) Jeff Goldblum and Tessa Thompson were also great additions to the cast. Korg and his alien buddy (I forget his name) there were probably the highlights for me in the film though - so unexpectedly hilarious, with larger roles than I thought they'd have going into it! Also, Doctor Strange's small scene was fantastic! And the ending of the film definitely left me intrigued - it's a great setup for *Infinity War*. Also, how can I not mention how great Matt Damon's cameo was?!

But yeah...overall...I thought it was an okay, perfectly enjoyable film, that didn't quite meet the expectations that the reviews raised for me. Basically, the acting was all great and on point, it was the execution of the plot I had trouble with. I'll get it on Blu-Ray when it comes out though, and watch it multiple times. Roll on *Black Panther* and *Infinity War*!",7agfes
dp9r9dp,"The barrage of jokes weren’t as offensively juvenile as GotG2, but so many were hit or miss; the entire first act was a clunker. But all served the usual Marvel requirement of undercutting any ‘stakes’ and tension. It was impossible to care about anything going on - or anyone - in the film.

At one part, Banner goes “I can’t turn into the Hulk again. If I do, I’ll never turn back to normal”. Oh, so this is now serious? Nope. He throws himself off the spaceship to turn into the Hulk... and lands on his face as a jokey joke.

In fact, the whole film had this odd juggling act, constantly shifting between 3 different films. One has Cate Blanchett hamming it up by chewing scenery, the other is super serious “RAGNAROK IS COMING!”, and then there’s the jokey joke part including Jeff Goldblum being Jeff Goldblum.

I also ironically love how Thor’s diction went from Shakespearean to full on Bro-speak.

dp9r8x5,"have to admit I was a little disappointed. I enjoyed the movie, especially any time that Thor and Hulk/Banner shared the screen and anything with Valkyrie (although where the heck was Lady Sif?) and it was definitely funny.

however, the way the movie was being hyped us was that it was going to be like the Winter Soldier of phase 3, and I don't think it really hit that mark. to me, the movie should have been more like Civil War, which had some humorous moments but also really great action and some real emotional moments, but this movie shook aside most of the serious stuff to focus on the comedy.

it was also way too predictable, once Odin said ""she draws her powers from Asgard"" I knew ""oh Thor's just gonna release Surtur and have him destroy Asgard and they'll move to Norway."" nothing in the movie emotionally resonated with me, even seeing Asgard get destroyed and Odin dying, which should have felt like monumental things in the MCU and really didn't leave an impact. 

the movie was definitely funny, the cast's chemistry was good, and the director definitely did what he set out to do, I just feel like the choice to go in this direction was a poor one. once again the Thor movie is the worst of it's phase, and a movie that should have turned Thor into this amazing badass God King of Thunder instead made me less interested in his character moving forward compared to the rest of the Avengers lineup.",7agfes
dpdwaw5,"I liked it a lot, but the tone was off. I had already shifted my expectations from an epic spectacle to a well done action/comedy.

And it was very very fun. But I mean I think the tone never taking a shift for the more serious did hurt it a little. Hela and Surtur were both wasted IMO. Odin and the Warrior 3 are gone too now? Thor's eye is gone. Thousands of soldiers died. Asgard (the place) is gone. And for all these losses and consequences, there was never a sense of stakes.

And some annoying gags/plotholes pissed me off. The GOD OF FUCKING THUNDER is gonna get tasered repeatedly? Why were Hulk and Thor put into the same room? ~~Why is the Grandmaster so weak if Ego was so strong?~~ Are there only 5000 people on the entirety of asgard? Plus the whole ending was very reminiscent of Wonder Woman (not a good thing) with brother v sister/bad cgi/going nuts on henchmen

Overall, it was a very fun movie, but it seemed like Taika had ____ plot points he wanted to do and the rest of the story/character actions revolved around that. I also think tonally, there was a problem, but again this is a Taika Waititi film first and a Thor film second. 

But at the end of the day, this is the only way we were gonna see Taika in the MCU and i'm happy he got to make his vision. Would he have been better for say Guardians Vol. 3? Yeah, but that's Gunn's baby. Overall, I give it a 7/10. Doesn't reach the highs of Logan or Spiderman but is about Guardians 2/Wonder Woman level for me",7agfes
dpdbu7c,"Guess I'm going to be in the minority here, but I just don't think I liked it.  It's weird because I went in ready to love it, but the tone just never clicked for me.  I felt like every single scene was basically a setup for a joke or gag.  Guardians of the Galaxy (1) had the perfect balance of humor/action/story.  This felt way off balance to me.  

Every single character being comic relief was just too much. Even Banner was written in a weird way.  The scene where Banner is trying to explain that he may never come back if he changes again is dismissed as Banner being pouty and Thor joking about liking Banner more than Hulk. And then later he changes to the Hulk and the problem isn't addressed at all.

The Balrog (I don't remember what he was or his name, so this is what me and my friends called him) also seemed too damn convenient, and it felt way too deus ex machina to me.  I thought it was cheap that the solution to beating Hela was something that Thor had conveniently done at the beginning of the film due to his visions.

I don't know.  The movie just had no weight to it for me.  What little stakes there were in the story were quickly laughed off with the imminent gag or punch line.  I just left the theater a few hrs ago, so I feel like I need to stew on it some more, but I feel very disappointed.  I'd like to say that I should see it again to get a better understanding of how I feel, but I really do not want to sit through 2hrs of that again.",7agfes

dpckh32,"I loved the humor in this movie. I loved GOTG 2, but did get tired of the characters *trying* to be funny. 

It loses value when someone is trying to make a quip. It works better when it's simply them being their character.

Example: Thor telling his story of Loki trying to kill him as a kid. That's not Thor trying to be funny, but it's hilarious for the audience. That's a lot different than Rocket or Drax being ridiculous (the winking, yelling, etc.). 

Another example is in Logan, where he's screaming at Laura to ""shut the fuck up!"" when she starts speaking late in the movie. It's not him trying to be funny, but the audience enjoys his exasperation.

I guess it's about making the laughs organic, and minimizing the slapstick stuff. By minimizing, it makes the few slapstick moments (Banner splatting on the bifrost walkway, for example) more funny. They also were able to be serious when they needed to be. Other than the Thor/Hulk fight, there's not much joking during the fights (""help me!"", and Hulk going after Surtur are all I can really remember). ",7agfes

dq0hpap,"7/10

I felt like I was watching three movies: Thor 3, a Planet Hulk movie, GotG 2.5.

I liked all of the ingredients, but I didn't like the final product as much as I probably should have. The entire time Thor was on Sakaar, I felt restless and irritated. I wanted to get back to the A plot of Hela and Asgard. I was tired of the side quest dragging on and on and on and on...

Granted, that was almost certainly the point. We're meant to share Thor's stress that Asgard is going to Hell while he's gone, but Good God did I not give even half a shit about the gladiatorial games or the Grandmaster, fun as Goldblum may have been. I would have much rather seen Thor exploring the worlds in search of the Infinity Stones and having more run-ins with strange, fantastical creatures like Surtur and his minions than leaving that all up to dialogue. 

Now that Doctor Strange has magic ""acceptable"" in the MCU after Thor 1 hammered us over the head with Asgardian Magic = Technology, I would have really liked to see Thor go full Middle-Earth instead of Star Wars.

I wasn't big on how often it went to the humor well either. I know Marvel movies love their quips from their cheeky heroes, but they let the air out of too many of their own scenes. Thor braining himself on the ball when he tries to break the window pretty much killed the gravitas of his speech to Valkyrie. Thor spinning around in the chains gutted what should have been a fantastic introduction to the guy who will blow up Asgard. Sure, I liked a lot of the jokes like Banner face planting on the bridge or ""I know him from work!"" A lot of the jokes did genuinely work. There were simply too many of them for my liking, which meant that some of them were ill-timed and scene-derailing.

All of that said, Hela was fantastic. Thor rebounded with another standout villain after the huge letdown of Malekith. I normally hate cop-out deaths, but I would be pleased as punch if they found some way to bring her back for the big Infinity War two-parter. ",7agfes

dp9tzft,"On the one hand this still had a lot of the same problems that every Marvel movie is starting to show, but in spite of all that I still enjoyed it quite a bit.

For starters, unfortunately the villain still isn't that interesting. Cate Blanchett's performance as Hela is entertaining, and the character definitely had potential, but in terms of what we actually *see* on screen, she's really just another run-o-the-mill Marvel antagonist. Definitely one of the better run-o-the-mill Marvel antagonists, but still not anything truly interesting or compelling.

Also, this movie is quite possibly even *more* quip-overdosed then Age of Ultron was. For some reason though, I actually enjoyed the constant joking a lot more this time than in Ultron. Maybe it's because the tone was lighter overall and most of the time the immediate stakes weren't as high. Though I did still have some problems with something serious happening and then being immediately followed by yet more throwaway jokes. Aside from the occasional mood whiplash scene, however, it was pretty solid in the humor department.

Lastly, despite the samey villain and so on, I feel like this might actually be another Marvel movie with actual consequences at the end. I was about to say the only one, but Civil War at least had a *few*, even if they'll probably be undone quickly in Infinity War. Who knows, maybe the consequences of Ragnarok will be unmade at exactly the same time, but at least for now it feels like something has actually changed in the MCU.",7agfes

However, that being said Marvel movies have all really been blending together recently, so this was really a breath of fresh air.

This was the best marvel movie ive seen  Thor > iron man(except tony is too serious/leaderish which makes it less fun) > captain america (decent) > avengers 1 and 2.  Avengers are really boring with tons of jumpy action like transformers.  Anyways, thor 3 was great!",7agfes
dpjashy,"Great movie.  The tough part is that often when they have to choose between serious drama and comedy, they often chose comedy.  Not that it's a bad thing per se, but i just didn't feel that worried about asgard because i was too busy having fun.",7agfes
dpttuuf,"It was a fun action/adventure/comedy, I'd probably give it about a 3/5.

I didn't think the two stories meshed together particularly well though, I wanted much more Cate Blanchett and to actually care about the fate of Asgard (which I didn't, at all). But... I also wanted more stuff on Sakaar which the Asgard story took away from. I had the same issue with the soundtrack - great 80s synth stuff, but it reverted to syrupy orchestral music when they wanted to tug at the heartstrings... and mine remain un-tugged. It felt like 2 movies mashed together and both deserved more breathing room.

I think I would've preferred an entire fun, light-hearted film on Sakaar, and another darker, more serious film on Asgard to get the most of out Cate Blanchett.

That memory/flashback with the Valkyries was absolutely stunning though, I could watch that all day! Based only on the trailers I thought that scene was going to be part of the end battle, so I was surprised to find it was such a short segment. It's unlike anything I've seen before.",7agfes

dpfao4e,"The movie is good. But honestly it's just way too much comedy.  Most of the jokes worked, but some just feel  out of place.

I'm always one for comedic bits in superhero movies, but there is such a thing that you can go too far. The first Avengers to me is still the gold standard for balancing comedy and seriousness.

 I also feel the movie plot is way too simple.  It's really just an ancient villian comes back from nowhere, banishes hero, hero recruits friends, and comes back to defend his kingdom.  There really is nothing to his sister that is remotely interesting, other than her badassery. But badassery alone doesn't cut it nowadays. 

It's a good, not great, movie --- that's still leagues better than any post Nolan DC films

dpfq6qt,"I really liked it while I was watching it, but thinking about it more I do think they could've tried harder not to undercut every dramatic moment with a joke. It works sometimes, but when it happens constantly it really makes it feel cheap. Again, I didn't really think about it while I was watching the movie, but especially when Asgard was being destroyed they didn't need to joke about it. 

Edit: but sometimes it worked really well imo, when Banner splatted into the bridge I was laughing my ass off.",7agfes
dpqosi8,"Just watched it. I'm gonna be honest, I thought it was good, but not great. I thought they overused the ""cut to a completely different scene during a fight right as soon as a big impact is about to happen"" way too much. Banner seemed like an idiot for most of his screentime. And I thought they took the quips way too far. It seems like Marvel just doesn't know how to do heavy stuff. They're escaping from a fire giant destroying their world, something that should be a truly sad thing, and what do they do? They have the comic relief character try to be funny by comparing it to a burnt-down house.

Marvel really needs to learn when to make jokes and, more importantly, when *not* to make jokes.

Overall, I give it a 7/10. Worth going to see if you like superhero movies. If you don't like superhero movies, it won't change your mind.",7agfes
du870ia,"The more I watch Marvel movies the more I see flaws and dislike them.  

Let's start with the humour that's being used. It's very predictable and just not funny. The scene where Banner jumps out of the plane and crashes onto the bridge. Just think about this scene. You see the wolf running, shot of Banner thinking, moving to the side of the plane (who's flying?), saying some dumb line, and jumping.  
As soon as you see his close up you know he will be the one going to stop the wolf. And as soon as he sais the line you know he's going to crash.  
The only fun moment I found within the movie was at the start with Thor dangling on the chain, turning around. It's unexpected and doesn't take away from the scene itself. It's still some exposition so it's fine here. The fact that they did it a second time right after actually adds onto it.  

Scenes that just are not needed or create plotholes. The biggest one here is the following:  
Hela follows Thor and Loki through the skybridge. She knocks out Loki and about 20 seconds after she kicks out Thor. Later Thor finds Loki and Loki reveals he has been there for three weeks already. The Grandmaster says time there is a bit wonky. Nothing is ever done with this.  
But if ~20 seconds = 3 weeks, just how long are Thor and Loki in that area? Because Hela has crossed the skybridge, slain the entire Asgardian army, etc... . But the movie progresses as if all events are happening around the same time. Just REMOVE the entire time thing. It adds nothing.  

The same is true for the Dr. Strange scene. Outside of some clips for the trailer this adds nothing. Maybe it's used for comedic effect but that clearly didn't work. Maybe it's a setup to make sure they are introduced already for another movie but just do it in that movie then.  

And another big thing is out of character actions.  
Loki is the god of misschief. Everything he has done in previous movies had a clear goal for him. Why would he be performing plays? He isn't Narcissus!  
The same happens when Loki and Thor try to escape with a stolen airship. Why would Loki try to betray Thor there? He would be going along with the plan and do something AFTER they escaped. But maybe this fits.  

And then there's Hela, the goddess of death. Does this seem like a character that would toy with her victims? Because she hasn't in previous action scenes. If you look at her entrance in Asgard she quickly kills two warriors, only leaves one alive because he might become useful to her, and then slays the entire Asgardian army with no remorse.  
Then why does she toy with Thor? She wouldn't take his eye out, she would kill him. She wouldn't be having him down on the ropes and ask him 'what are you the God off again?' TWICE.  
This scene could've been done different. Hela kills Thor by a stab through his eye. He lies death under the painting of Odin that Hela has revealed. Hela moves towards the battle on the bridge, not caring about just killing her brother. You see a wide shot of Thor lying there in the hall and then a closeup of Odin's painting on the ceiling. Camera slowly zooming in on odin's face as a drop seems to fall from Odin's eye. As it drops towards Thor in some slow motion you hear rumbling and in the moment the drop hits Thor he is struck by thunder, awakening him.  

It's still a bit cliche but it would work better and more in character.  

Then there's the Valkyrie. We get a scene with a bunch of them attacking Hela and only one surviving by sacrifice of another. Hela is clearly more powerful than all of them together. It's a nice scene for trailers and does add to the movie in showing Hela's power.  
But then you have the end fight between Thor+valkyrie and Hela. Thor just got his new powers but this Valkyrie girl should get her ass whooped. ",7agfes

* Thor and Strange are having a serious conversation, and Thor knocks down a bunch of Strange's things, having to pick them up. How awkward.

* Thor is hanging by a giant chain and arguing with a giant demon, and the chain turns around, and we have to wait for him to get back in position. 

* Thor says a big punchline waiting for the hammer, and the hammer never comes, so there's an awkward pause, and we wait for the hammer to drop. 

* Banner jumps off the top of a plane to transform into Hulk and faceplants on the bridge without transforming. How awkward.

* Thor throws a sphere at the window to bust out of his cell, and it hits him back in the face. Another awkward pause for him to stand up and smash it properly. 

And more and more and more. There were so many that I couldn't keep count.

Thor tells Hulk that he's been away for two years, which then means that every movie does, in fact, happen in the year that it takes place, meaning that there's no way that Civil War happened eight years after Avengers when Avengers clearly happened in 2012 and Age of Ultron happened in 2015 and Ragnarok happened in 2017.

His sacrifice at the end in order to save the ship of people was understandable. He wanted admiration from others, which was obtained when he brought out a 2 hour old joke to defend helpless people and threw himself off the ship into a pretty badass action scene. Maybe I shouldn't turn to these types of films to find side characters that make the full transition to evil, but I wish that were the case here. Throughout the entire film we have characters seemingly evil turned good; Loki, Valkyrie, Hulk (to some extent). I just wanted 1 character to turn evil, even if it's not through his own free will. Maybe during a raid of a village to ""round everyone up"" he is demonized by an elder. Overcome with anger, he butchers him in cold blood. As people are horrified, or his undead troops rally behind him, he understands this is what he wants instead. Perhaps his armor granted by Hela controls him, or at the very least his axe turns into something more than merely a prop. I would've loved to see it forged from Hela's bones or obtained from the vault, matching in power to some of the weapons already shown. He becomes truly evil, only to die by Valkyrie while Hulk fights the Dire Wolf and Thor combats Hela. No redemption, or secretly good guy all along. A person who was consumed by evil and greed and died for their actions. I mean, he spent all this time with Hela, I can't understand how she didn't corrupt him in any way. He felt one dimensional and I wish they spent even 5-10 minutes on him so we could root against another bad guy.

dpen9ke,"I'd say it's still a good movie, but overrated. I liked it, but other than the visuals I don't know if it's really that much better than the previous Thor movies. I liked them too, but they're kinda forgettable, especially the second one.

The jokey Asgardians of the Galaxy tone would have gone much better with a story that was not literal Ragnarok. All but one or two heavy dramatic moments were undermined with jokes, so even those moments can't deliver any emotional heft because they had no proper room to breath.
Voltagg and Fandral are killed of like a couple of extras. Thor himself has been humorous before, but now he's morphed into almost Archer. By the end I was wondering if Thor is supposed to be as socipathic as Loki, because the deaths of his father, three of his best friends, and destruction of his world has barely phased him and he's still joke-y and smiling. Guardians 2 made me feel more about Yondu's passing and Pete's anger about his mother than Ragnarok did about the fall of Asgard.

The movie was generally funny, but I only truly LOL'd once or twice, the rest of the (many, many) jokes never drew beyond a smile or a smirk. I didn't hear a whole lot of laughing in the theater, either. Not when compared to the Guardians movies.

I've honestly never found Cate Blanchett personally attractive until this movie. That's a good look for her.

I think Goldblum's only instruction on set was to ""just do your thing."" Which is amusing, but I would have preferred they made him the monarch of Sakaar (forgot the guys' name from WWH) rather than The Grandmaster. His personality and function in the story is really nothing like the Grandmaster of the comics at all. At least Benicio Del Toro's Collector was still all about collecting things.

I think there's something missing right after the Hulk fight.
Why would the Grandmaster put them in the same apartment? For that matter if the fights are supposed to be to the death, why is Thor alive? I can come up with various reasons, but nothing was even suggested. It's rather jarring.

I have no idea how many Asgardians escaped.
On the bridge and when they're shown boarding the ship it only looked like several hundred to me. But there's a shot towards the end of the movie of an enormous chamber full of people with at least one other chamber like that behind it stretching into the background. Where did those people come from, and is the ship supposed to be bigger on the inside?

The Dr. Strange cameo was fine, but didn't advance the story one bit. I guess it's just there so that somebody in the Avengers will already know Strange in Infinity War.

What didn't work for me was that the humor wasn't natural. It felt alien and didn't really work within the movie and seemed to just be there for the audience. 

The main conflict was a bit of a let down as well, but that's expected from super hero movies. The main bad guy isn't even a central point of conflict until the very end of the movie, even though the plot revolves around her. Our hero instead spends most of his time trying to leave a junk planet and getting into a fight with the hulk. Who just happens to be there?

Every single character was the same person. Thor, Heimdall, Loki, Valkyrie (who didn't have a name, btw, wtf?), Scourge, even the fucking Goddess of Death. They all had the same awkward personality, cracking dumb one-off jokes at the worst times.

Every potentially emotional scene was ruined by some dumb wise-crack. Which is fine once or twice, but not *every* time.

Sure, it's great to see Chris Hemsworth exercise his comic timing (and for the record, I think he's really funny) it came at the expense of the character.

You know what would have been fun?  Thor, after traveling around the galaxy getting into massive epic fights (like say with Surter), finds himself stranded on a weird, bright world after his long lost sister appears.  He becomes a fish out of water, this rigid warrior in some goofy landscape that he has to escape.  Slowly then, through the movie we could see him get funnier as the new world and his new predicament affect him.  Finally, at the end, he could take his Dad's place as ruler and realize that he needs to be his own man and not just a copy of his dad as represented by, i dunno, cracking some one-liners.

The opening it a bit jarring because tonally it is just so different than anything else marvel. Some folks have said its what GOTG2 should have been, but the issues GOTG2 faces is that its too big (too many characters, too many storylines, too much setup) while this is much simpler by comparison and is just a movie about Thor and the buddies he picks up on the way. 

Biggest issue I've had with this film for a while now has been Helas hair. It keeps going back and forth between being greasy and matted to being salon beautiful. I know there were several reshoots (the hammer breaking comes to mind) but even within scenes it seems to go back and forth. ",7agfes

I still really enjoyed it, but yeah, I prefer an MCU film like both Guardians of the Galaxys (or the first Thor, for that matter), which are able to successfully juggle the humor and drama and have them complement each other, not distract. It says something that Guardians 1&2 especially, considered the 'jokiest' of the MCU movies, actually feature the most emotionally powerful writing.

Of the stuff I liked I really really really loved the offbeat tone of the film. Combined with Thor, who is always been a bit of a buffoon at, it made for a wonderfully weird viewing experience with some great characters great locations etc. I remember Taika Waititi saying that Ragnarok was heavily influenced by movies like big trouble in Little China and flash Gordon. Plus, I think I picked up on a couple of references to What we Do in the Shadows as well. All of it served the movie really well.

Loved it the aesthetics and the casting: great stuff there. This might well be the most talented cast in a marvel film made to date. After all, you've got Jeff Goldblum, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins, Cate Blanchett, Tessa Thompson, Idris Elba and others. 

While I loved the music, on its own, it felt a little disjointed when played during action scenes. 

Too bad all of the best jokes were in the trailers. If even one had not been used in marketing, it would have generated huge laughs. As it was, my audience WANTED to laugh at everything but there just wasn't much that we hadn't already seen in commercials. 

Another sound issue: volume on dialogue was way too low. This is likely a theater thing so I don't blame the movie for that one.

The tone doesn't have to be dark to sell the drama. Some movie is pretty dark but in the end, nothing happened, no concequences at all. ",7agfes
dpb7w58,"Anyone else think the movie was just on the bad side of okay? 

Went into the movie expecting some dark drama, what with Asgard getting demolished. Instead it was a buddy comedy with tons of jokes and a tone that flip-flopped more than Loki's allegiances.

Loki's actions were treated as an, ""Oh, you!"" joke throughout the movie, which was silly. And there was almost no internal conflict with the characters accepting him despite him being a terrible person. There was no internal conflict within Loki himself as he flip-flopped around the entire movie. 

The whole Doctor Strange scene could've been cut, with Thor and Loki finding Odin on their own. Strange never showed up again, and didn't do anything besides some neato magic teleports. 

Hela was really REALLY weak as a villain. She was the goddess of death, and her power was... making spiky things. Okay. It would've been cool if she was reviving everyone she killed with her powers. Thor's warrior buddies could've fought him in an undead state - their deaths could've actually been acknowledged by the plot. There would be some drama, which this movie sorely lacks. 

All the jokes in the movie truly killed it for me, and it's not because most of them didn't land. There was no sense of urgency or threat, and Thor didn't even seem too broken up about his dad dying, or his people that were surely suffering. And his dude bro attitude just made it worse. Even in the end, where he's the new king, they had to put the dopey wave in to remind us that, yes, Thor is still a teenager in his coming of age comedy. 

I could go on. 

The movie's entertaining, but it's a rent. 

TL;DR Fun doesn't fit Ragnarok, but Ragnarok was trying to be fun. ",7agfes
dpbiirm,"Overall, I have the same criticism for this movie as I had for *Age of Ultron*.  If you're going to do a movie with a heavy theme like the destruction of the world of our main characters, don't clog it up with jokes.  Let the serious moments breathe and let the audience feel the weight.  It seemed like with the exception of Odin's death, every time there was a possibly sad or serious moment, there had to be a joke to balance it out.  The tone see-sawed all over the place.  I'm comparing this to *Spiderman: Homecoming* which even though it was a comedy, had a better balance of tone and resonated deeper with me.

Still, *Thor: Ragnarok* is a good movie and the best of the Thor movies.  It's funny and I really liked Valkyrie.  I thought she was just going to be the straight man to Thor and Hulk, so it was nice that Waititi gave her a personality and her own quirks.  Sakar was more fun than Asgard.  Fenris was badass (I love giant predator animals).   ",7agfes
dpex35l,"Just came back from seeing it today, movie is very easily the best MCU movie this year, and one of the best in the MCU period. I was laughing my ass off half the time by how funny it was, it felt like there was a really good joke every minute or so and I'm so glad it was like that. And I'm glad they didn't really try to make it serious whatsoever, that would have been very tonally inconsistent with the rest of the movie's humor/bad-ass fight scenes to where it would be off-putting. I didn't really like how they kept cutting from Thor's story to what Hela was doing in Asgard (like it was 2 different stories), but the humor was so damn good that it makes up for it, and I would also say that it makes up for any other flaws the movie could have as well. Not just a great movie for the MCU, but a great movie in general and I'm sure anyone would find the type of humor to be funny to where they would get a laugh out of it.

I thought the first 1/3 to 1/2 of the movie was slow and cringeworthy.  So many lame jokes.  They were so overkill on jokes.  Thor can be funny and play to the ""handsome hero strong god"" thing.  Tony Stark can joke and play to the ""super rich genius smug ass"" thing.  But everyone in this movie was making jokes.  It got so old so fast.  

The end fight scene is pretty cool to watch.  Hulk acting like a baby is really annoying.  Punching ships or tearing off a panel apparently makes them crash.  Jeff Goldblum had some hilarious moments then some cringeworthy moments.  I thought his part could have been much better.

At times, it felt confused as if it did not know what it wanted to be. Thor's arc was appearing to be a journey of self-discovery but Thor did not change. Similar notions can be made of Hela, Hulk, and Loki. Only Valkyrie and Skurge had character arcs in the movie, which may be why Tessa Thompson and Karl Urban had such a presence in the film. Compared to them, Thor and Hela were one-dimensional character that represented conflicting eras of Odin's life. Tessa stole this movie, and I give equal credit for her performance to Taika Waititi. Valkyrie is an interesting character but her backstory and motivations were not narrated clearly. The same can be said about Hela, who could have been written better. I was surprised to see that Ragnarok's Hela was partly influenced by Amora the Enchantress. The leggings, Skurge, and the spite Hela emoted felt emulated from Amora's portrayal in earlier Marvel projects like Earth's Mightiest Heroes. It's sad because Amora can be an amazing character in the MCU. Asides from the lack of character development in the main characters, the movie worked.

It's a terrible mess of a movie that really feels like it was put together by a committee. One minute, it's trying for Guardian of the Galaxy zaniness. The next it's asking for the audience to be moved by something serious. The plot is way too epic for it's own good. They lay out the most important of events, and then give none of it any time. Things just happen, and lead to other things. Sometimes those things makes sense.

The Executioner is totally irrelevant to anything going on in the film. There's no good reason why he's in it.

Hela is a total waste. For a god of death, she does nothing but throw swords around. It makes me laugh now to think how people were speculating that this was going to be the character Thanos was trying to impress. She's less death god and more ""really good ninja.""

Loki does nothing clever or interesting.

Jeff Goldblum... ugh. I mean, not his fault. I'm sure he's doing as instructed with a script like this, but still... ugh.

Some of Thor's stuff toward the end of the movie were good, but getting there is incredibly tedious. Almost everything about the film was tedious. It's seriously tilted toward comedy, and very little of the jokes landed, in my opinion. A comedy with jokes that miss is a very tedious indeed.

I wasn't really messing with this movie at all, but then again, I'm not much of a Hulk or Thor fan. I thought the humor was pretty childish which would be cool for 10-13 year olds, but not for my mid 20s self. The slapstick was pretty good though. The banter between Hulk and Thor basically consisted of them behaving like little boys and the audience is supposed to laugh because they are not that, but rather larger than life men. Hulk would say something like, ""Hulk not doo doo head, Thor is doo doo head!"" and Thor would reply, ""Unheard of! It is you with the stinky head of doo doo!"" and we're all supposed to cry in tears. I mostly gave it the blank face O_O 

The villains/antagonists once again are bland as hell. I've only watched the first Thor, so forgive my ignorance, but Hela seemed to be a last minute villain, introduced briefly by [a dying Odin like, ""OH BY THE WAY, you have a sister and she's the Goddess of Death. OK, BYE!!!"" Then she pops in and speaks in heavy exposition like, ""I am Hela, true heir to throne, blah blah blah."" which is lazy writing to me. Hela literally asking Skurge what his motivations were was an even more egregious example lol.](#spoiler) 

Grandmaster played by Goldblum...bleh. Something about a flamboyant dictator that enslaved and oppressed his people just seemed wrong to me. The behavior in which he carried himself didn't make me believe the commoners would fear him at all. They lost a good opportunity to build up a rebellion led by Thor or Hulk to overthrow their oppressive dictator IMO.

On second thought, maybe Grandmaster's flamboyant, playful demeanor wouldn't bother me so much if the other antagonist in Hela didn't display the demeanor as well at times or that big Flame guy that is destined to destroy Asgard. There wasn't any gravity or stakes in the movie. So much levity, I can't find myself worrying about their plight to save Asgard when it's all treated as a joke.

Thor and Hulk showdown was impressive. I'd probably just watch that scene when in the mood. The rest of the action was OK I guess. Mostly CGI figures mauling a horde of other CGI figures otherwise with lightning and spinning and slashing. They had an interesting idea of having a battle on the bridge, one in the air, and one in the water for the last act, but it didn't connect well to me. LOTR did something similar in terms of mini-battles going on and I was hoping for something like that.",7agfes

dpd9bgr,"I'm gonna copy what I said in the MCU subreddit:

This was my least favorite MCU film this year.

The action? Amazing.

The actor's? Fantastic.

The comedy? Meh.

For all the Thor films flaws, they had had a grandiosity to them. Asgard and the Asgardians felt regal in them, Thor and his fellows aliens felt relatable while doing so, even if ignorant of human customs. The emotions felt during Thor (Loki's adoption, Thor's banishment, the brothers fight) and Dark World (Thor reuniting with Jane, Loki's and Fryga's death), were intense and authentic.

This movie has none of that. This was a Guardians movie that was forced into being a Thor movie and it suffered for it. Hell, even Guardians allowed for tender moments and heartbreak. This movie was so shallow and uncaring that it felt like a Rick and Morty episode doing a parody of Thor, complete with Thor losing brain cells along with his hair.

Was it a bad movie? No, not by any means. But it has none of the heart or charm from the previous Thor movies, and is a solid ""Watch fight scenes and Hela clips on Youtube"" type of flick.

Not only have I been disappointed by the camera work and effects that seem like they are from a college student film project, but they are obviously trying to make this like Guardians of the Galaxy type humor, which Thor was never like. Loki and Thor have been acting like fools, with no explanation for the stupid way things have been since the last movie, and the villain, Thor's sister, is trying way too hard to be edgy and dark and 'wow, power level over 9000!' All of her movements and the way she says her lines really break the realism of the movie. It's something I would expect from a 1998 superhero flick from Blockbuster's bottom shelf, not a huge franchise blockbuster. I may come watch the rest of this movie just to be filled in, but I'm not going to go back and see another Marvel movie in theaters without some convincing after this farce.

dpd2ar7,"Meh. It was alright.

PROS:

- Good chemistry between the actors.

- Nice designs.

- Cate Blanchett was a lot of fun, despite having far less screen time than she deserved.

- Jeff Goldblum was very entartaining.

- Some fun action. Especially Hulk VS Fenrir.

CONS:

- It felt very choppy. The second act on Goldblum's planet feels a lot like another movie.

- The humor was overbearing and it was very hit and miss for me.

- The desire for humor led to some characters feeling rather out of character.

- Nothing felt important or consequential.

- The Ragnarok was quite a let down for me, compared to what it's supposed to be in northern mythology. Half of the movie doesn't even have anything to  do with it and it didn't really feel like something epic or tragic. The twist of having the actual destruction of Asgard happen by Thor's hand was fun, but it still didn't feel like a huge deal to me.

- The amounts of time Loki tricked someone then reformed then tricked someone again got ridicolous and he felt very out of place. The script seemed desperate to give him something to do.

dpa8gb7,"Watched it last night.

First, the movie was excellent. As others have mentioned, it wasn't the best one, or the funniest, but it was a great movie.

It was the best of all the Thor's IMO. I thought the first Thor was slow and kind of boring, the second one was better but still wasn't up to par with other Marvel movies.

They really took this movie to a new level, a grand adventure, large fights, interesting places. It felt guardian esque in that sense and so so different then the original Thors. 

I thought Helya had probably one of the best, if not the best movie bosses in the MCU yet. I've always felt that the movie bosses never get their moment to shine, to show who they are and why they are considered so powerful. Helya makes a grand entrance showing her power immediately. She then systematically clears her way to Azgard and then immediately wipes out the famed Azgard army. One thing that got downplayed in that scene, is she was blowing up ships way the fck in the back of the screen!!! She had no help, she had no minions, it was her!! Then they build her up with valkyrie history. She is a villain that should have been around in more movies. To see her go down in that lame way was lame :/ Thor didn't defeat her and ultimately I feel he is a weaker character for it.

I want to spend time on a lot of my cons now.

The biggest of which is the endless comedy. I laughed, had a great time, but ffs the comedy felt so badly timed. Let serious moments hang please!! For guardians it works, the team makeup is such that witty banter helps them get through their fights, gives them the strength they need. Thor, Loki and Banner are not comedians. Thor and Banner are warriors, calculating fighters with the power that backs up their confidence. Loki is highly intellectual and yah the movies now treat him like a joke, but he is ALWAYS up to something and thats where his strength comes from. He is always outthinking the moment. 

This movie needed a lot less comedy. I mean azgard was in peril threat, the whole population was a sword throw away from being wiped out. There was too much joking in this moment for sure. 

Thors character has changed and I don't know how much I like it. He was this strong heroic warrior that towered above everyone else on the battlefield with his presence. Now he feels like a drinking buddy ALL THE TIME. I liked when he turned that on and off when the moment was right. Drinking buddy was needed during the talk with Hulk, it was not needed during the fight with Hulk, or scenes with Loki, or the fight with Helya.

The hulk.. they pushed this character forward ALOT with 0 explanation of anything. First, no reasoning or backstory on how Hulk got to this planet, got captured, got his status, learned to talk, etc. This was most disappointing as I had heard about the cartoon planet hulk thing and that story sounded EPIC. 

Next, we now learned that Hulk can be controlled to some degree, he has a mind, whereas we all thought Hulk was only around for protection/to destroy threats and thats what motivated him. Hulk has feelings and thoughts now!

Which brings me to Banner. Banner finally breaks free from Hulk after 2 years. This is basically his worst fear, that he loses himself. He even mentions it afterwards, the next time he becomes hulk might be the last!! He has mentioned this multiple times in the MCU. But there was NO seriousness given to this. Hulks extremely important character growth in this movie, was completely slashed down to a quick few points and this was extremely unfortunate. 

Hulk makes this grand entrance to fight the puppy, then they immediately knock them off, show a couple punches and then hes back on the bridge.. The one thing Marvel has always done well, is show all the fights in an up to the moment way, all areas of the fights are shown, with action in the background and everything. They just kind of threw hulk away and brought him back when it was convenient. WHAT!!!

Finally the Helya battle. This was friggin huge to me. Azgard, the protector of the 9 realms, this not planet thing full of gods that has fought and won countless wars, defeated some of the strongest enemies, etc. etc. They just ended it, without a thought. We know that they didn't get all the citizens, we know they didn't get the artifacts they were protecting. They lost the bifrost, the gateway to all worlds, their warriors protection and attack power. 

The substantial effects of this is something you could talk hours on, but it went poof no tears were shed and that was it. Helya was controlled once, their had to be alternatives. 

I could go on, but thats enough for me, I got the big ones out of the way.

1) Hulk and Valkyrie could have hooked up during the years that Hulk was the champion. I think their dynamic would be more interesting with a sexual element. Thor would later say something about how he saw Hulk without a towel, she'd say something like ""Who hasn't?"" Could also add some innuendo about how Thor is ""not as big as Hulk.""

2) I didn't like that the Asgard story was completely separate from their story. And why were the Asgardians such weaklings? Not sure how to tie everything together a bit better. Maybe tricking the grandmaster into attacking her and Asgard? Maybe it seems like there are three unbeatable enemies at the end, but they trick all of them into killing each other, each exploiting each other's weakness in some kind of rock-paper-scissors scenario.

3) Valkyrie could have played up the drunkenness a bit more. I really like when the heroes and music crescendo into some ultimate finishing move and then fail. Like when Banner hits the ground.

Just saw it, quick pros and cons:

Pros:
- humor overall, movie was basically constant giggling
- Some cool actionmoments, God of Thunder parts expecially
- Tessa Thompson
- Banner faceplant
- Thor, ball and not-so-fragile window

Cons:
- humor overall, movie was basically constant giggling
- Loki's previous actions were totally overlooked. ""ah, you little trickster you"" -mentality was maybe too much. 
- Odin's death was just...oh, I guess he is glowdust now? 
- Dr. Strange scenes were kinda unnecessary, he could have been added to the movie in a more subtle manner. 
- Did all asgardians fit into that one spaceship? 
- Hela as a villain was just not as great as she could have been. More darker overtones and actual memacing demeanor might have worked
-Basically the movie didn't feel like it had any stakes or rush, even though Odin, ancient superbeing died and all nine realms were about to plunge into chaos. 

Now that seems like and awful lot of cons, but the movie was a solid 7/10 for me. I had couple genuine outburst of laughter and loved the new characters introduced.. The comedy was just taken a little too far. Not every scene has to have comedic relief in it. 

As far as Marvel movies go, Thor's movies are supposed to be more mystical and serious, I mean they are about ancient gods with their customs and history. Now it was just a space-comedy with entertaining action. Not that there is anything wrong wirh that.

dpb9s79,"I just saw it, and am somewhat mixed, sorry if this is unsorted:  
  
It felt like half the movie was callbacks and introducing all the characters.   
Korg and Insect-thingy? I know the director voices him, but the voiceover was *terrible* in german.   
 
Loki is just all over the place, bad here, good there, his actions seem to have no consequences(which - in some things like dark comedies were people just accept that as part of the style is okay - but it somehow doesn't fit here) - and once again he is a sort-of antagonist and ends up being a ""little better off"" with the tesseract at the end, which will either be resolved offscreen or be taken from him 5 minutes into infinity war by Thanos - he's just a vehicle for story progression at this point.    

Thors fight with Hela (and lack of Hulk therein) was a massive letdown. After the setup on Planet whatever as Hulk being sort-of stronger than Thor, he gets bitten by a direwolf and.. thats it? I admit the Banner scenes were good, and him just splashing onto the ground.. was wholy expected, unfortunately. They already pulled that in the Edward Norton Hulk film - and it didn't work for me, like a forced joke. Either way Hela stabs Thor a bit, scorches out his eye and then the fight is done.. it was all so.. anticlimatic. And almost the enitrety of action, once again, takes place on the rainbow bridge. There have got to be other locations on Asgard(well not anymore).     

The Valkyrie is a bitch the first half of the movie, and - yet again, being a bitch gets forgiven because we need another swordhand. I didn't feel like she had any redeeming qualities in the end and only helped because Loki(yet again as plotdevice) mindraped her and dug up her memories of duty.      

Thors buddies get killed and not mentioned. At least asian dude got to fight a little, I'm not even sure french guy was the same actor anymore. Sif doesn't exist anymore? Too busy with her TV show? Both Jane&Sif got dropped for this movie, the two romantic interests from past movies. Not that lack of forced romance is bad, but at least Jane got a throwaway line in the intro.   

The two after credits scenes should have been switched. Waiting for Jeff Goldblum to stumble out of some spaceship was .. disapointing. In fact, the whole planet and its entire Story felt disapointing. There's a Plane that - like the Ether - connects to various places? And is a natural Rainbow Bridge? And somehow a hundreds year old megalopolis has been built by Jeff Goldblum in 40 years because ""things are wonky here""? The whole movie could have been about that place - and yet seemingly the entire thing stays unresolved? Sure there was a ""revolution"" that we literally didn't see a thing off aside from Krog pumping his gatling-pumpgun thingy - and boom revolution done.   

I feel like there was way, way too much in this movie, and it's just planet hulk and ragnarok cramed into one incoherent mess that isn't either of them properly. Especially Hulk - in Planet Hulk Hulk&Banner comunicate and agree to stay in Hulk form, and now they are seperate again, after seemingly leaving ""earth"" in ultron in a banner-controlled hulk state- without un-hulking to switch to pure hulk..?  

I still enjoyed it, but yet again a Thor Movie is a steaming mess, I don't know why this keeps happening.  
Also, did the scene from age of ultron lead to anything after all? Wasn't there some black lady there too? Or were there too many years between those two movies to properly connect them?  

Soundtrack was great though - I love how Stranger things and Thor3, gotg2 all now have such amazing soundtracks.

",7agfes
dpd9fgs,"I was dissapointed overall...there were a bunch of cool moments and good ideas, but too many chinks in the movies armor to forgive. I need to flesh out my thoughts more, but for instance when Hela revived Fenris and that army of the dead, they did literally nothing. It seemed like there were no consequences, and as such I wasn't invested in Thor saving Asgard. Those soldiers hidden in the vault pose literally no threat, well besides respawning because there was clearly only like 50 to start but I guess there were several hundred? Then there were moments they physically couldn't be somewhere, but the movie placed them there to artificially create tension. And Fenris looked so cool, but ended up doing very little. If they were all so incompetent and Hela is all powerful, why wouldn't she just summon a costant whirlwind of blades?

 ""Well then Hela would be on her own and that boring!""

Well at that point this movie needs reworked majorly, but clearly what they did, didn't work out. This movie only existed in its state to make an easy obstacle for the hero to overcome, make some cheap gags, to set up for future Marvel movies and to make a ton of money. There was SOME stuff underlying, but it was basicallycast aside for gags about Thor being strong. It was ok and had some moments though i guess, which would probably put it at a solid 5/10 for me.",7agfes
dpde2lh,Just an ok popcorn flick. Comedy was way too forced,7agfes
dponayc,"I've heard so many good things about the director and that he made the funniest movie of the 21st century called What We Do in the Shadows but I gotta say the comedy in this felt really forced, even for Marvel standards. Plus, if you've seen the teaser trailer (not even the final trailer) you had already seen the best parts of the movie, and I dare to say fooled to think that it was not going to take place in boring Ass-gard for so long.

One other thing that I was kind of confused by was how they just simply discarded Thor's friends from the first movie (Hogun, Fandral, Volstagg.) I know a lot of people think that movie sucked but I can't be the only one to think that they could've done something better with those characters or at least killed them off in a less quick and forgettable way. I mean, Ray Stevenson played Volstagg and Zachary Levi played Fandral. I guess Jaimie Alexander was busy filming Blindspot but I liked her in those movies but I get that she's not in this one. Sue me but I liked these characters more than I like Heimdall for instance.

I love me some Karl Urban but I honestly felt like his character shouldn't be in the movie. You can see what's gonna happen to his character from outer space. I would have loved to see him play a better written character.",7agfes

dpeazd9,"It was an entertaining film for sure, but I'll be honest, I was disappointed. The comedy was forced and the lines were cliché, unoriginal. Hela in particular had some of the worst lines I can recall in a Marvel villain. 

Stylistically, it was great (the valkyrie riding scene, ohmylawd). But the writing (and shitty joke after shitty joke) really took me out of the film :/. I get they have decided to simplify everything to appeal to an international/non-English native speaker audience, but it frustrates me as a pretty hardcore CBM fan. My two cents.

Immigrant Song was used extremely well in both the scenes. My favorite part of the movie is still the Gladiator scenes.

Many of Korg and Miek s scenes didn't land so well at the show I attended. 

I imagined Hela to have a bigger role in the movie. As a result i don't feel she's a top tier marvel villain, even Vulture was better. My only complaint is that Infinity War setup wasn't that heavily tied in to the story.

The only two parts I wasn't huge on was the Warriors Three getting so effortlessly killed off, it worked as a way to set up how strong Hela was but I don't think Zach even had a line. Just a little something would have been nice. 

Skurge turning was also a little over telegraphed in my opinion.

dpbe8fi,"I liked this movie but it was littered with issues. 
 
The pacing was terrible. You know a movie needs to be re-edited when you find yourself looking at your watch more than once. The movie was guilty of slamming the pacing brakes hard, cutting from continuous rhythmic scenes on Sakaar to Hela's evil business in Asgard. It was as if the writers were so involved in Thor's storyline and then realized that they had forgotten all about Hela and made a page break. And then the third act just began. Just like that. I think there was meant to be some tense build-up transition with Heimdall's attempt at fleeing from Hela, but that was all just cutting room floor. Not to mention the tonal shifts - especially in the beginning. Fun Doctor Strange moment, then solemn Odin moment, then fun action moment, then . . . ughh . . .  

Speaking of jarring, all of the exposition to the Dark World / Age of Ultron ending cliffhanger mysteries with Loki's takeover and Hulk's disappearance were quickly touched upon in passing but never really given a decent payoff. I waited four years to find out how Loki dethroned and replaced Odin and still don't know. I waited two years to find out where the Hulk disappeared to, but was left questioning how it happened. Not to mention the quick death cameo's of the the Warriors Three, a non-present Lady Sif, and a disappointing mention of Jane's whereabouts. Everyone left my theatre asking Huh? Wuh? Suh?  

On top of that, there were so many more questions about Thor's underwhelming response to Loki being alive, Odin's Obi-Wan Kenobi death, Grandmaster's half trash / half hedonistic paradise planet where the locals love the Grandmaster but simultaneously want to revolt, how Thor could simply wake up alive after a cut-to-black. Also who / where / when / why / how Hela's deal; how she had a pocket full of infinite knives, how she could summon giant pikes, etc.  

All that being said, Taika's injections of hilarity into this film are its saving grace. Joke after joke after joke interlaced smoothly and often subtly keep the movie fun and help us forget all the inconsistencies. And his choice of colourful upbeat Jack Kirby artwork makes this so so so much more fun than the dreary Dark World was. It gave a very 80's He-man / Thundercats-esque vibe to Sakaar. All of the colourful alien beings populating Sakaar, even though they are backgrounded, are absolutely eye-catching. Goldblum does Goldblum as loveably as we'd expect. Hemsworth gets to show off more of his comedic chops this time. Ruffalo is hidden behind mo-cap 2/3rds of film and still gives a fun performance in translation. But the real standout this time is Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie. She's given a wide character arc as a miserable downcast drunk turned hopeful graceful hero-for-hire. If there was ever a fourth Thor film, it would definitely be a handover to her character.  

TLDR; My consensus - It's just as mediocre as the previous films were, only much more of fun and funnier time.",7agfes
dp9s6b8,"Overall liked it, would give the movie a 7/10. The humor is a little hit or miss, more hit than miss at least.

I was surprised and liked the tiny hints at class warfare that I never would have expected to come from a Marvel film. When Hela talks about the means of their (*Odin/Asgard*) acquisition of wealth and then hoarding it that was something I thought could have had a great resonance today. Her in the throne room talking to Skurge reminded me [of this scene from Adventure Time](https://youtu.be/cBHouBDjqsc). 

On top of that, the center of the movie has Thor enslaved by The Grandmaster (*played beautifully by Goldblum*) to perform in his ""*bread and circus*"" battle for the masses. He's fabulously wealthy and out of touch high in a gaudy shining tower. He even says he hates calling them slaves and to call them something else at the end of the film (*not to NOT have slaves... keep slaves just rebrand them so it's legal sounding*). Which also  ends in a people's revolt/uprising.

Unfortunately there was only glimpses of these deeper themes within the movie and wish they spent more time exploring them. I think the movie could have served better with fully diving into this instead of using classism as a cute backdrop to give a breath between goofy antics and jokes.

dpa25be,"As I've said in the other thread, I liked the movie and had a great time, but some jokes were unnecessary and killed the mood. But I was expecting comedy so it's all good. I watched this yesterday evening and I'm still laughing at some jokes.",7agfes
dpeqwtu,"Well first off it totally sucks that we won't see a proper Planet Hulk/World War Hulk movie now. But It was a good movie, it was an action comedy for the most part and that makes it better for couples watching it. If it's not romantic it better be funny or it will lose many of The female votes. The Hulk vs Thor scene was awesome because it helped show that they are really the most powerful Avengers. The Valkyrie scene was my personal favorite scene it was a really powerful 3 minutes and I know If they made that movie I would watch it. But I loved it and my wife loved it. I'll definitely watch again!",7agfes
dpa0561,"I hate to be the one pissing in everyone's lemonade, but I thought this film was good, but not great.

For starters, the humor is toothless and inoffensive. Not saying that comedy has to be edgy, but I didn't laugh once. Everyone around me seemed to be having a good time though. So maybe my sense of humor is broken.

Anyways, this film is perplexing. It's weird, but also restrained. It's eccentric, but also dialed back. It's pretty to look at, but also underwhelming. And I think a lot of this has to do with Disney controlling the MCU. If a movie takes any narrative risks, then it's taking a financial risk. Anytime a unique director makes one of their movies, Disney (and their producers) strips away any personality and makes a product easily swallowed by mainstream audiences.

Honestly, I was mostly bored throughout the entire film. Just because you change the setting, doesn't make it a good film. If the same set pieces happened on Earth, everyone would hate this movie. But the surroundings weren't fleshed out or explored. 

If you liked this movie, then I STRONGLY recommend you check out Hunt for the Wilderpeople. Not only is it Waititi's best film, but one of the most heartfelt (and hilarious) movies in years.",7agfes
dpa34ew,"Fun movie. Some of the humor was pretty lame, but when it was funny, it was really funny.

dpa5m51,"Ok there's no denying Tessa and Cate are so damn attractive. 
But what the eff is it with these so called warriors slinking around as if on a catwalk when in battle?
Also Hela looked great but had zero anything else. I thought she would be terrifying. The arena bit stood out. Thor's comedic bits were great. But all else was just meh.",7agfes
dpaq4hn,"I still liked it but don't think its as incredible as everyone is saying.  

The humor was funny but a bit too frequent.  There were a couple times where I felt like they were repeating jokes or the humor landed flat but it was mostly because it was so prevalent in the movie.  Cutting back a bit on the humor would have helped the movie in my opinion.

The movie also felt very disjointed.  I felt like the characters were just bouncing from place to place to place until they finally got to Sakaar.  There are definitely times where I felt a scene needed another minute or two to fully develop but it was instantly cut short.

The characters in the movie were either really great or really bleh in my opinion.  Hela was a really week villain and Skurge felt like he didn't add anything to the movie other than fan service (which isn't necessarily a bad thing).  Korg was incredible and I would honestly watch a movie about his first rebellion in a heartbeat.  I really liked Hiddleston and Hemsworth in the movie although I felt like they really, REALLY dumbed down Thor in this movie.  I get that it was to play along with the Hulk-Thor rivalry of brawn over brains but he felt especially clumsy in this film.  Ruffalo was fine.  I didn't think he did an incredible job but he also spends most of the film as Hulk.  Grandmaster was hilarious.  I definitely hope the Goldblum returns to the MCU in some capacity after this.  Thompson's Valkyrie was okay.  A lot of people said she stole the show but she really just felt like female Thor to me and didn't stand out too much.  

Overall, I liked the movie but Thor 1 is still my favorite of the trilogy.  I'd give Ragnarok a solid 7/10, just behind Thor 1 but well ahead of The Dark World.  ",7agfes

dp9rksn,"This was so much better than what I was expecting, and I really respect the film for that. 

Even near the beginning when Thor was pulling that Tony Stark shit where there's a joke every 7 seconds, they toned the quips *way* down and made the humor seem natural. And that it was. No one ever went out of their way for a laugh.

Thor himself was a bit of a blank slate, and I was a bit let down to see his entire arc boiled down to ""the power was inside you all along"". Also not a fan of how they used his constant jokes to compensate for a previous lack of personality, but that's just the way the cookie crumbles.

Although Hela is part of Marvel's growing list of Distinguished Actors Who Are Wasted, she bought enough menace to seem like a decent threat. But alas, she disappeared from the movie for a good 25 minutes before the end required her to show back up. And since most of her story was explained in 5 minutes, there wasn't much reason to fear her. I don't think this movie needed a villian, to be honest. All she seemed to do was just remind us that Thor needs someone to fight. The structure of the film made her seem there for the sake of being there. Had she been more of a character, I probably wouldn't be having these thoughts. Also, I wanted to see more of her doggo.

Valkyrie is a step in the right direction for the women of Marvel, and it was refreshing to see her as an alcoholic fuck-up who finds her way back to glory. I wouldn't mind her having her own film. Hell, I want her to do the collab with the other female Avengers if possible. Tessa Thompson's also bae, so that helps.

Hulk was pretty much there because the plot required him to be, and I wasn't a fan of him just being there to make jokes. We get a glimmer of something meaningful with his Banner transformation in the Quinjet, but it seems like they glossed over it for the sake of runtime. 

Loki was Loki, and the Grandmaster steals the show in typical um-um-um-ah-yes fashion from Jeff Goldblum. Oh, yeah, and Korg was entertaining too. I would've liked to see more of his simpler observational comedy.

Overall, it's the only good Thor movie and makes me **very** happy to be a Marvel fan again after *Spider-Man: Homecoming* almost put me off this whole universe.

The action and soundtrack was good but there was a noticeable lack of stakes, even with Thor having his damn hammer broken, it never felt like he was in a situation he couldn't win. This isn't helped by the nonstop comedy. I like to laugh as much as the next guy, but there comes a point where a movie should take its story seriously.

As far as characters; Anthony Hopkins was really phoning it in this time around, Hela was great but there were several times when I got the feeling that Cate could've easily just been playing Enchantress. Valkyrie was much better than I expected and Hulk stole the show every time he was on screen. Although I still wish Planet Hulk was it's own movie.

Soundtrack was decent, would have liked more synth tracks though.

Tessa Thompson's accent was all over the place. Just use your American accent girl.

The high points are definitely during Sakaar. Asgard felt like a afterthought to me, except for those last 5-6 minutes of fight set pieces. Cate Blanchett felt underutilized, Hela could have been an intimidating villian but they went with the jokey route again.

It just felt weird to see Hela act like a buffoon essentially but I guess that was the tone of the film. At the same time I think Tessa Thompson is going to be a star. She was great as the Valkyrie.

I saw it last night and had really high expectations, and while I liked the movie overall, I left with little to no ""Marvel movie afterglow"" if you will. When I left Civil War or Spiderman: Homecoming I was buzzing and talking excitedly with my friends about it, but after TR, I was just listing all the things that bugged me about it.
I know Taika's whole thing was to make it a standalone movie, but this far into the MCU it seemed almost too removed (save for the Dr. Strange scene and mentioning of past events). But I think my biggest let down was [Blanchett's Hela. I was PUMPED for that and she was kinda 'meh' to me. Her story felt a little too convenient and she didn't really scare me in terms of ""Oh no, Thor is in trouble"" She just kind of said her lines in an evil way and smiled and that was her playing a villain I guess. I don't know how to explain it, but I never once felt like our main characters were ever in danger? I did LOVE Valkyrie and hope we get more of her. Her and Hulk's relationship was fun, but then totally not explored after she found out who Bruce was and I felt like I wanted that.](#spoiler) 

Lastly - the comedy seemed forced, cliche and old-fashioned to me honestly. I laughed out loud maybe a few times, but even then it felt like they were trying too hard? The overall vibe felt weird and off and I still liked it, but was not blown away. ",7agfes

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 of course had all the great one liners you'd expect from James Gunn, but the film was balanced by a real gut-wrenching character arc for Peter. Spider-Man: Homecoming was a joy to watch, but it seamless switched the high school humor in the first two acts to tense and dramatic third act.

dpadswp,"The first half hour of the movie had me ready to declare it the worst MCU film, but it picked up once the Hulk was in the story. The first half hour or so suffered from things just happening for no reason. Odin dying, Thor getting captured, Dr. Strange having an unnecessary cameo. It's bad screenwriting when there's no real reason to get from point A to point B. I also think it had probably the worst example of killing dramatic tension with stupid one-liners. Some of the jokes were really clever though (I loved Thor telling the Hulk that he preferred him over Banner, and vice-versa). Plus this one felt like there were real dramatic stakes. All in all, a good way to close out Thor's trilogy.

dpa12mp,"Overall it was a good film.

I wasn't really into the film until Thor met up with Hulk. The beginning was just too much humor in a way that made Thor act very out of character. From quips to him being a bumbling buffoon, it just felt odd. And tonally the humor undercuts a lot of the dramatic moments. None of the deaths have any weight. Every character introduction is a joke, which again undercuts how seriously I can take the characters.

Thankfully a lot of the humor worked better on the alien planet. Where it's just a big trippy fever dream. The planet Hulk stuff was just a fantastic Thor/Hulk team up adventure that I never knew I wanted. The whole mid section feels so disconnected from the ""Ragnarok"" storyline, which brings me to my other issue: Hella. While badass during action sequences (love her taking out the asgardian guards) and fantastically portrayed by Cate Blanchett. She doesn't really do anything for the most part of the film. She is again one of those villains who just sits back for the entire film, does evil things and at no point is concerned about the hero of the film. Which makes her once again a cookie cutter marvel villain.

I almost wish the entire film was about a thor and hulk space adventure. Since everything else about Hella and Ragnarok was so incredibly cliche and bland. 

This movie is really saved by the characters, badass action sequences and the humor, even thoug that can be a hit or miss sometimes. One of the better marvel films in terms of visually creativity too.",7agfes

dpckrk3,"It seems I’m in the minority here, but I don’t think this is an exceptional Marvel film. It’s entertaining and amusing (more so than it’s predecessors) but I don’t see how it sticks out as one of the best Marvel films so far as some have claimed. It’s the funniest Marvel movie, sure, but not if you look at its Laugh/Joke rate. They REALLY try to be funny and it only works some of the time. I saw it in a packed theater and many of the jokes left the audience silent. There were absolutely golden moments, but it seemed disproportionate to attempts. 

I will say this saved the Thor standalones for me. I thought Thor was mediocre and the second one was boring to me. This is easily the best Thor movie in my eyes, and I greatly respect the filmmakers for making the dialogue mostly improvised. That was trying something new and it seems to have paid off for most people (myself only half included for he reasons stated above). This film gave Thor depth and great personality that I felt was incredibly lacking in his previous appearances (although I fear Infinity War will have too many sarcastic cocky characters all in one room now). The action pieces were fine; I did like the bridge scene toward the end more than the Hulk World fight, which surprised me. 

Once again, I don’t think this breaks Marvel’s top 3 best because it’s still incredibly formulaic and doesn’t break any new ground with its action nor its characters, but gets points because it tried something new in its pacing and tone. Marvel fans will like it, as we do, but I don’t think this will garner any new fans nor does it show Marvel heading in drastically new directions.

dpeq8mi,"Just saw this.  Very fun, silly movie.  If you turn off your brain and enjoy the Thor vs Hulk fight and the Thor vs Hulk dialogue, then you'll like this movie.

That should kind of clue you into the quality of the dialogue though...the Hulk has what appears to be close to a plurality of speaking lines.

Cate Blanchett was a great villainess.  I like the twist on Ragnarok, that it was used as a tool for victory instead of the whole end of the world type thing.  The plot seemed fairly consistent with the world that they built...can't really think of any glaring plot holes off the top of my head.",7agfes

Also LOVE the Beta Ray Bill easter egg. On the Grandmaster's tower there are heads and one of them was Beta Ray. Hoping we see him in the future!

Definitely think Hela comes back. She had a quick ending and she will be awesome alongside Thanos.

Pros:
1. Great pace lots of jokes every now and then.
2. Can enjoy without watching previous parts.
3. Unique take on Thor without hammer, ""is he still powerful"" ?
4. You get Goofy talking Hulk.
5. New female warrior kicking ass.
CONS:
1. Its a COMEDY action movie not a ACTION comedy movie.
2. Like other superhero movies villian's weak and no consequential threat.
3. Might Feel Like Valkyrie was getting a huge push.

dpee8vv,"Woah, man! This movie was like, too funny! 

Like REALLY TOO DAMN FUNNY!

Like... why was damn near EVERY OTHER LINE A STUPID JOKE.

As you may figure, I didn't like this movie. It's so damn... desperate in wanting to be like GotG, and god is it irritating. The tone is so different from the previous two Thor movies, its frustrating, and where it WAS trying to be serious, it's always undermined by some dumb joke. *Oh look! Here's Thor's friends he's known for centuries getting murdered like fleas..... AND SKURGE THE EXECUTIONER (sans Enchantress) IS USING A MOP! L-O-FUCKING-L!* And kinda on that note, where the hell was Lady Siv or whatever her name is? At least Hogun went out like a warrior with that sweet MK kill via sharp spikey knifey thing. And back to Skurge real quick... my god did they ruin him. He's a joke, a remorseful, joke of what his character should be... and why the hell are Earth-based guns hurting UNDEAD, ASGAURDIAN, WARRIORS?!?! This movie ruined S'kaar. Like... what the shit? We get 3, THREE, III, Thor movies, but no second Hulk movie? C'moooonnn! Oh and Loki... jesus was he ruined too. Remember when he was gleefully smiling as he was using a device to rip out a guys eye in The Avengers? I member. And good god, what a wonderful send off or the All-Father, Odin. In the comics, his death could be felt by every diety and cosmic being thought the cosmos... here... discount Master Oogway. Dust in the goddamn wind. And why did everything or ""skaar"" look so damn cheap?!

But enough about damn near everything wrong about this movie, how about a few positives?

1. The Hulk actually, finally talking instead of going ""RAAAAAAGGHH!!"" 
2. Clancy Brown as Surtur. Good performance, almost didn't recognize him at first. 
3. The resolution too beating Hela. I liked it. Using Surtur to do it, basically LETTING was was ordained for millenia, actually happen. Hela was to strong with that infinite knife shit she had going on, as a result of her being in Asgaurd. Solution? Release ultra powerful fire demon to destroy Asgaurd as he wanted which in turn would weaken her, and basically kill her when Asgaurd goes boom. RIP Surtur, you da MVD. 

All in all I feel this movie had WAAAAAYYY too much forced humor, butchured to source material (Talking REAL Norse Mythology) even more than the comics did, but at least they included as much as they could like the Serpent and other things with a few tweaks, where as here it was ""Thor's world ends."" And that's pretty much it. I didn't go into it expecting much (Its a damn Thor movie for Christ's sake) but still. Just hope Black Panther brings the game back up to par, and Infinity War is dark enough to make up for this films campiness, which it might as that's probably Thanos' ship at the end, drawn by the tesseract. Death is sure to follow. All after Justice league, or course. ;)",7agfes
dpg7wx6,"Is it just me or this movie was dumb af. I mean cmon some of the jokes were so lame and the movie was a tad bit long. Also in the trailers, Hella looked so badass, in the movie she was just another character except ""that fight between her and the valkryies"" scene flashback.

Also Thor's scenes with Odin were so boring and lame and had poor cgi.

dpzvawd,"Finally broke down and watched the movie.  Was planning to save it for home release, but what the heck.  Doing my part to give the movie a little extra push on this specific weekend.

I already expected the movie to be good, so I was, ironically, a little taken aback when it turned out to be good despite my elevated expectations.  Whenever this happens, I'm forced to nitpick.  No movie is perfect, after all.

* The pure-CGI characters, especially the rock guy.  Still waiting for the day when these guys don't look obviously CGI.  It has to do with the floaty, inertia-less, hand-animated way they move.  Rock guy's mouth suffered from this particularly.  I suppose what's ultimately required is nothing less than a true physics engine for the entire bodies of the characters -- animate off that and then we'll be talking.

* The valkyrie's actress had a habit of doing a head swivel, in pretty much any circumstance.  Left/right.  Got annoying quick, and won't be able to un-see on future viewings.

* I didn't hate the score but I do wish, as I often wish of _almost every_ score of the 21st century, that these composers knew what ""leitmotif"" means.  Or melody and harmony.  It doesn't always have to be forgettable droning.

* The use of that pop song.  That's DCEU-level cringe.  And it was used twice.",7agfes

Additionally, I hated how after surtur destroyed asgard, korg made a joke it lessened the impact of the destruction. Thor ragnarok was the wrong movie to put so much humour in.

* First, I really enjoyed this movie, but in ranking all the MCU movies this would be middle of the pack. I'm finding it a little crazy the people that are in this thread saying it's their new favorite Marvel movie. There are quite a few Marvel movies I'd rank above this, but again I still liked it a lot.

* Second, at the risk of sounding like a stick in the mud, is it just me or did it seem like there were a lot of dick/sex jokes in this movie? Again, it's not like I don't enjoy those kinds of jokes every now and then, and I know that other Marvel movies have made similar jokes before. It's just that this is the second Marvel movie in a row now (GOTG 2) where I've come out of the theater thinking, ""Man, that was a lot of dick jokes for a Marvel movie.""

EDIT: Goddammit I knew this would happen. Let me reiterate:

* I liked this movie
* I laughed at the dick jokes in this movie
* All I was trying to say was that it seemed like there was a sudden influx of dick jokes in the last two Marvel movies and I was wondering if anyone else had noticed this trend.",7agfes

Was rewatching Thor 1 and i realized that the third act of Ragnarok revolves around a plot hole. In the original Thor theres a scene where Odin banishes Thor through the Bifrost, which was what Hela was trying to gain access to at the final battle in Ragnarok. The plot hole arises when we see that Odin is able to use his scepter to open the Bifrost, when in Ragnarok, Hela is only searching for Hiemdalls sword. How could they miss something that was so important to the climax of the movie?! Hela was literally within arms reach of Odin’s scepter during the throne room fight, and could’ve easily snatched it when she first invaded Ass-place.... Assburg.

But ok, my thoughts on the movie: I feel like Marvel's biggest strength is convincing you that this next movie will be different from all the other Marvel movies, and then it isn't.  I feel like Waititi was kept on a tight leash, they let him influence the movie, but not go balls to the wall with his own style, which is what I wanted.  But yeah, great movie, but still another Marvel movie and I would say it's completely forgettable and skipable if you want to see something else instead.  ",7agfes

Back in 2011 the challenge was grounding thor for audiences so they could connect with him and introduce people to this world in space of as gard.

Also, her core conflict felt really similar to Loki’s from the first Thor movie (Odin is mean and doesn’t like me and I should be in charge).

Marvel’s inability to create lasting and interesting villains is my biggest gripe with them as a studio.

but Marvel have given us plenty of strong emotional moments all the way through the MCU...off the top of my head:
 
- the Shakespearean family drama between Odin/Thor/Loki in Thor
- Tony's sacrifice play in Avengers
- Frigga's death and funeral in The Dark World
- Shield turning Hydra, and Steve/Bucky in The Winter Soldier
- little Peter Quill being afraid to hold his Mom's hand before she dies
- Groot sacrificing himself to protect his friends
- Banner feeling so much like bad news for Natasha that he leaves her after Ultron
- Scott Laing's relationship with his Daughter in Ant-Man
- the turmoil that Tony, Steve, Bucky, T'Challa and Zemo all go through in Civil War
- Stephen Strange's emotional struggles after his car accident
- Yondu and the funeral in GOTG2
- Thor finding the God of Thunder inside him finally in Ragnarok...

Thor never had that power because he wasn't Odin's firstborn, but his own Asgardian power was never used to its fullest until the end of the movie.  We establish firmly that it's not him drawing strength from Asgard because he first uses it in his fight with the Hulk on Sakaar, and Odin and Hela both have to physically be on Asgard itself to draw power from it.

duf59l2,"> Some things about this movie annoys me as a Norwegian. The ""Haha, It's great that there's female valkyries, about time!"" line makes no sense. Valkyries have been a part of Norse mythology before Christianity was a thing in Norway. Why would Thor awkwardly joke about that?

So I just saw the movie, and I want to point out that that's not exactly what Thor says. He said he was all for ""female warriors"" in general. The Valkyries in this universe were always female, and Thor specifically says that. Now, you're right that the line doesn't make much sense in the context of the universe. The Valkyrie's *predate* Thor, and he knows they are all female, so clearly there have been female warriors for a long time. The humor in the line is meant to  basically break the fourth wall, referencing a trope of our modern gender politics. This is true of many lines in the movie (nonsensical in-universe, but supposed to be funny to us). Doesn't mean that you have to find it funny, but I'm just explaining why. It's also partially referencing the fact that it's a ""woman warrior"" who just crushed him and is about to destroy Asgard... but the phrasing is mostly meant to play on our own modern tropes. This movie breaks the fourth wall a *lot*, for better or worse. But he never says the Valkyrie's aren't always female (they are).

> And why is the valkyrie black? And Heimdal for that matter. I mean, I love the portrayal of Heimdal, or I would if it was just another fantasy movie, but if a movie about African gods made some of them white, what would the reaction be?

Really? Of all the ""liberties"" this takes with Norse mythology, the one sacred line that they cross is making some characters black? And I say ""liberties"" jokingly, because this movie doesn't really get *any* part of Norse mythology ""right"" besides a few names and titles. Just take your pick... Hel is supposed to be Loki's daughter, not Odin's, she was never Odin's general as he conquered the nine kingdoms, the mechanics of all the magical shit in Asgard are totally unrelated to how they were said to work in the mythology, that's *not* what ""Ragnarok"" is, at all, like I would start to go on and on but it's pointless, because the Thor series is *not* an attempt to tell the story of Norse mythology. Nothing is accurate, because it's not trying to be. It's telling a comic book story with some characters vaguely inspired by Norse mythology. To focus on the fact that they changed the skin color of a few characters seems bizarrely nitpicky... that's the first thing that comes to mind, and not the fact that none of the main characters or locations or plot points are remotely what they're like in the mythology? 

If you take issue with that, and think that cultural heritage should be off limits from inspiring imitation, then that's a fair position to take, but then you should seriously take issue with the entire premise of the Thor story, and the casting choice is a very weird place to start (I'll also note that plenty of the other white characters playing Asgardian characters are not of Norse descent either...). For what it's worth, basically the same thing happens with Wonder Women and Greek mythology. They use a set of characters that share the same name and titles, but the similarities essentially end there. And again you have plenty of people playing roles across cultures (Ares was British, in fact I don't think any of the characters were greek?). Comic books frequently take inspiration from various cultures. You can take issue with all stories that appropriate direct inspiration from a people's cultural heritage, but know that this is going to apply to a *lot* of fiction out there.

dxu4dex,"As an avid fan of Norse mythology, I always wondered how a Norwegian would take the interpretation of Thor considering his hammer, is basically the equivalent to a Modern Christian's view of Christ and his crucifixion. So much so, the person responsible for the coloring of the Avengers cartoons asked me how Asgard should be rendered and I told him the color palette should be hyped up vibrant and the shots on earth muted earth tones. When he did that, he got rave reviews and I believe that influenced the Thor 1 and 2 movies. Notice in 3, the color palette was huge colors everywhere that was in contradiction to the first two. There were so many subtle and not so subtle differences that I now feel that this last movie was Marvel's Thor...not the panning to the original Thor. It's like going to see Jesus Christ Superstar and really expecting some semblance of the Real Jesus dancing around on a stage. That's nonsense for anyone to actually think Jesus was deified BEFORE the council of Nicea in 380 AD. He was just a very wise man with a special commission from HaSh*m Himself. I think deep down people are looking at the heavens for this Jesus/Thor like person rolling around on clouds when in reality, the second coming is born of a woman who later is given his ""hammer"" or divine commission. Like Jesus, but given different powers to open the eyes of the blind and heal deep wounds in humanity. Why am I putting this here inside a crappy Ragnarok review...1) because Ragnarok is the equivalent to the ""great and fear inspiring day of YAHWEH"" and this ""world"" that we know and come to love is going to die...along with the wicked ones. They will see Jesus as you have never read or imagined him before.

She has clear motivations, they set up her backstory while at the same time making you think that Odin may not be such a great person. Hela's arc also helps to shed some light on why Loki is the way he is, giving the full picture of where his path was taking him.  


Infact, I felt some sympathy for her.  She talks about how her father made her a weapon, forged her for war.  They conquered 9 other worlds.  Then he banished her.  No matter who you are that would kind of suck.


Loki is the pivotal villain in the MCU but aside from him and the Vulture, I don't think the others are all that interesting or have as clear a motivation to do what they're doing based on the scripts alone.


Ultron wants to destroy humanity to...save humanity?  Or cause a cataclysmic event to save the planet?  I was very confused by all of that.  I think they were trying to pull an Agent Smith with him but missed the mark.  For me, anyway.


Dormammu is also only on screen for like 3 seconds, so you don't get a clear sense of his motivations.


Thanos is just a giant purple dick.  Despite him being the looming big bad for, what, 9 movies now?  We learn surprisingly little about him.


Ronan is actually a really solidly done villain.  But it doesn't really do a lot to illustrate the reasons why he's so hellbent on destroying Xandar other than the movies explanation that he's a zealot.  Which sucks, because I really, really liked his character design and Lee Pace is captivating to watch on the screen during his entire role in Guardians 1.


The MCU movies are getting much, much better at portraying villains as they go along, which they sorely needed.  And they're also learning that a more personal story sets up a better narrative.  I could give a crap about Asgard.  But a brother/sister rivalry?  Now that's something that's so *Desperate Housewives* that I'm glued to the screen eating popcorn like Eddie Izzard watching [The Room With a View of HELL!](https://youtu.be/IMBgG976EZQ?t=2m22s)",7agfes
dpaukvn,"I totally agree on the lack of empathy with the Asgardians. They for sure dropped the ball on that. I like the idea (since it's sort of from the comics), but they failed in execution. As for Odin's death, I think because he's going to Valhalla, which isn't technically him dying, it isn't supposed to be this insanely sad moment. He continues to appear in visions for Thor and helps him access his true powers. But maybe it would've been cooler if it was more dramatic. And the Hulk thing on the bridge...I agree that was a huge moment for him and it would've been great for the character to see it played more serious...but you can't tell me that him smacking down on the bridge wasn't fucking hilarious.

dpaulfr,"I have to agree! This direction towards a comedy superhero movie rather than a superhero movie with comedic elements is kind of urking me. 

It's almost as if DC had movies that took itself too seriously (Man of Steel), so Marvel does a complete 180 so they don't take themselves seriously at all even in times where they should be serious.

I'm all for funny moments, but when something needs to be dramatic, it should be dramatic! Banner jumping off of the plane to encounter the wolf beast was akin to him finally turning into Hulk in the first Avengers so I was thinking it was going to be similar. But, nope!

To me, the Marvel films with good comedic timing is Iron Man and Spider-Man (okay yeah I might be missing a couple but this is what I remember). The humor helps develop the characters -- Stark as a charismatic billionaire, Parker as an inexperienced superhero trying to fit in a world of adult superheroes. 

But Thor: Ragnarok and the two Guardians of the Galaxy movies are just humor for the sake of humor. I can give the first Guardians a pass, because they needed a way to introduce a virtually unknown superhero squad, but... if this is the new trend for Marvel movies I have to say I'm not a fan. And I LOVE Marvel superheroes too =/",7agfes

But is taken out of it by the screams of the asgardians below. Cut to a long shot of bruce falling as you see him grow mid air and crash in front of the people. Cut to a close up on the peoples reaction and the dogs.

Have Sif and the Warriors Three lead the rebellion against Hela, then when they inevitably get injured have some random Asgardians hide them. Heck, if they really wanted to kill them then make it more dramatic. How is the audience supposed to care about Asgardians if you kill off some of the only ones they have a connection with without any care?

I did like the story use of Heimdall but the design was terrible. Neither of my young cousins recognized him and I feel like they departed from his original speech pattern from the first two movies. ",7agfes

> It was probably explained in the movie but I can't recall; how did Thor end up where he did at the start? (with Surtr). Did ""Odin"" send him there?

depends on where the source of his dreams came from, odin knew his time was ending so its very possible he caused the dreams, alternatively the dreams came from a different source (looking at you one above all stan lee) to move the plot along. Seriously, we dont know if Odin was having the same dreams.

> Loki took a glance at the Tesseract when he was reviving Surtr. What are the chances he took it with him? They wouldn't show that for no reason right?

the tesseract is an infinity stone, necessary for the thanos infinity gauntlet plotline, yes he took it, its a chekov's gun scene.

",7agfes
dpbtjxn,"> so will he ever get it back?

Odin said that the hammer was only to help control his power, so getting the hammer back would seem to be a regression... if it ever does come back, I'd imagine we'd see it in a ""more powerful"" form, like with an Infinity Stone.

> It was probably explained in the movie but I can't recall; how did Thor end up where he did at the start? (with Surtr)

And especially for Thor, which was more serious in the second movie, and more lighthearted but still pretty serious in the first, Thor 3 took a complete 180. 

Personally, I liked the jokes and comedic elements, but I did notice that they vastly changed Loki to be more lighthearted and less serious. And I know some people had a problem with that. Because, before it was Loki, who was calculating and was always trying to be several moves ahead, whereas in this movie, he was still calculating, but it was more like one step at a time and not thinking ahead.

That and some people don't like redemption stories, and for all intents and purposes, he's somewhat redeemed now. I personally liked it, but I know it's not for everyone, they need to have a villain stay a villain, and that's up to personal taste.",7agfes

They tried to be much more serious with Thor 2 and it all fell flat. The whole Thor story line is silly to begin with, and it honestly probably would have been nearly impossible to make viewers suddenly care about Asgard when the first two movies spent most of their time away from Asgard and not getting viewers invested in the place.

Banner also mentioned that his brain neurons are firing at an extraordinary rate every second due to him being on a different planet and trying to grasp the whole concept of it and stuff.

Probably thats why Hulk took over Banner for those whole 2 years. The whole shock of being on a whole new planet altogether would lead to some form of ptsd, trapping banner in the hulk form.

Sounds like a couple hundred, but is exactly a Narrative-Fulfilling number of rounds, enough for a redemption from cowardice.](#spoiler)

[-What happens to the Annihilator armor? The other stuff in the Treasure Vault? Odin's Staff? The Eternal Flame is ... snuffed out?](#spoiler)

The movie was excellently written and beautifully put together; it just struggles with it's tone, which shouldn't be all that unexpected. It's important to balance a dark story with some amount of humor, but finding that balance is tricky and varies with the story. The balance used in Ragnarok would have fit better in Guardians of the Galaxy, but it was good to see a different approach to Thor after the approach to Dark World didn't quite work.

I'm afraid I'm not familiar with Taika Waititi's work, but having seen how he handled Ragnarok, I want to see how he normally works. Also, that epic shot in the gamemaster's audience chamber.

Once he eventually gets the hammer, you get the impression that this was his plan all along and he let himself get in that situation and all the stuff that led up to that was like a cat playing with a mouse.

With Doctor Strange, he witnessed his brother disappear and is trying to find out who this stranger is, but since he's the god of thunder, he needs to maintain the whole alpha-male persona, but ends up embarrassing himself.

The scene where he hits himself in the face with the sphere is kind of similar.  He's able to gain Valkyrie's trust or he's starting to, him and Hulk have smoothed things over.

It's about the characters we know, not a faceless group of people I know are imaginary and feel no connection to.

The film did let some of the more serious moments retain their tone without subverting them with a joke. Enough of them imo. But I understand that anyone who wants this material to be taken seriously won't feel the same way. For me though, the material is silliness and should be treated accordingly.",7agfes
dpbklkm,"I thought early on when Hela slaughtered the army, they did a good job of keeping the tone a little tense as it was paired with the early Sakar scenes were Thor is in trouble.

The destruction of Asgard wasn't something that was all that sad in the moment, because the characters didn't have time to be sentimental over the place; it was their plan, they were focused on the citizens, and their resulting success in saving the Asgardians certainly helped to keep their spirits.

Korg's joke was unnecessary when Surtur made the finishing blow, but I thought the last couple of minutes on the ship in the void of space did a great job of nailing the appropriate mood: weight-lifting relief at survival in the face of destruction, combined with the unsettling uncertainty of being refugees in the cold dark endlessness of space.",7agfes

Make Grandmaster the villain, with the Hela/Ragnarok stuff as an off screen ticking clock culminating in a similar (but shorter) climax to what we got. Helas scenes don't really do anything to add weight to it anyway, why not make her more of a force of nature character instead. Lean into the class stuff that you brought up and Thor's arc becomes more about him learning to value the people more than the glory of Asgard and his family legacy. Also would've given them time to develop Hulk a bit more.

The Strange cameo established the timeline between Strange and Ragnarok, and showed his proficiency with magic at this point. It also displayed that there's someone who knows about Asgardians on Earth and he's keeping tabs. Plus, it's poetic to send Odin to Norway, the base of Norse mythology. They needed someone that could quickly send Thor and Loki to Norway, now that Heimdall is in exile. Strange is perfect for that.

I do agree that it didn't really flow that well, it was more like someone sat down and wrote that part with a list of things to do, and just checking off when it was written.

dpajz5c,"> bad screenwriting

1. Odin dying was absolutely necessary and a huge part of the story. If Odin doesn't die, then Hela doesn't enter the story. It also forces Thor into a role of accepting the throne. In the first two movies, he is more interested in Midgard/Earth and doesn't want to be King. Odin dying informs Thor's entire primary character arc for this film. It is also consistent with everything we've seen from Odin in the previous films. He is benevolent today, but had mistakes in the past that he isn't honest about (such as where he got Loki from).

2. Without Dr Strange, you need a logical explanation for how they find Odin. The search for Odin could have slowed down the film. And if you have a shared MCU that you want to take seriously, then Doctor Strange absolutely needs to fill his role as protecting Earth from external threats.

dpdaas1,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Thor: Ragnarok. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of MARVEL comics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Loki’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Stan Lee literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about POP CULTURE. As a consequence people who dislike Thor: Ragnarok truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Loki’s existential catchphrase “I seek safe passage… through the *anus*,” which itself is an ass reference to Guillermo del Toro’s epic Crimson Peak. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Taika Waititi’s genius wit unfolds itself on their movie screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Captain America’s shield tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the fans’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Excelsior kid 😎",7agfes

Ragnarok had much more mature themes in it than any other Marvel movie to date. It had a continued increase in cussing, an alcoholic character, not-so-vague references to sex, much more violence (Thor had has eye gouged out for pete sakes), calling the biggest portal ""The Devil's Anus"" when there were much less blunt options for Anus to go with, and death everywhere.

We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun, where the hot springs flow
The hammer of the gods
W'ell drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde, and sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming!
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore
Ah-ah, ah!
Ah-ah, ah!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow
How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore
So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing",7agfes

Also I am curious if Sif would have died too if her schedule was free for this movie. ",7agfes

I mean if it isn't obvious the girl has just been used as a plot device since day one, they literally just write her in and out of his life as they please.

I guess, but they made me feel more like Thor would have - confused by the sudden changes with no time to adapt.

> Comic books frequently take inspiration from various cultures. You can take issue with all stories that appropriate direct inspiration from a people's cultural heritage, but know that this is going to apply to a lot of fiction out there.

That's fair. Growing up with these stories I can't really shake them as the source material, given that they get a lot of things right enough. I don't care about where the actors are from. I mostly care about the aesthetics. Though, I would have preferred it if the Valkyries were all Scandinavian looking. I get that I'm treading in very dangerous territory here, and I'm trying to phrase my vague understanding of my own opinion in such a way that I won't be strung up and hit like a pinnata. The Asian guy with the accent was another weird one. Why does he have an accent? What is Aasgard in this universe? It is a melting pot of cultures? Will they do the same thing with Wakanda? Plus, Odin even travels to Norway in the movie.  

Generally I prefer that characters stick to the race they're supposed to be. That goes both ways. Hollywood is especially guilty of that when it comes to Asian people. Cast asian characters as Asians. Bonus points if they actually speak their own language in scenes where that makes sense, instead of accented english. 

Mostly I dislike how charged this topic has become. If casting decisions weren't so political, it's unlikely that I would think about the implications and intent behind them. But then again, I'm a cynical asshole. I could see the PR disaster that could arise from making Aasgard 100% white, even if that would reflect the mythology more accurately. If I watched the movie again, trying to forget my own ancestry and instead remembering the comic book, I might be able to look past all of this. Especially given how cool Idris Elba looked. ",7agfes

This story of Thor had him be something more like a musclebound, Shakespearean goof.  He wanted to grieve yet knew of the greater mission, was a jackass, occasional klutz (who for some reason is stunned by electricity yet he's the God of Thunder, I'd figure they Luffy him making him impervious to getting shocked) but one that knows of duty and responsibility (bringing in all that's he's learned from his brief exile on Earth).

If there's something that may be a bit concerning is de-powering these heroes making them a bit too human.  I get making them klutzes on occasion but pratfall after pratfall from the group that's supposed to be Earth's Mightiest Heroes is a bit concerning especially 3 trilogies in.",7agfes

Cheap would be Thor shouting ""I have the power!"" and defeating her.

And the warriors three could literally have been replaced by any extra scrub and it wouldn't have made a difference. Why not have them running around with Heimdall (thus making his resistance a bit more believable)? If you're gonna kill em off, why not do so in the final battle, in front of Thor as yet another reminder of what an overpowered, heartless monster Hela is?",7agfes

dpcvyw5,"So question:

Early on in Sakaar, it is mentioned that Loki has been there ""for weeks"", although it seemed much shorter than that to Thor, who was only moments behind him in getting there. So we can assume that ""a few moments"" in our realm translate to ""a couple weeks"" in Sakaar... 

If Hulk was gone for 2 years *our time*, wouldn't that mean he must have been on Sakaar for a potentially *muuuch* longer time? I can also assume that since Grandmaster Goldblum mentions ""in any other realm I'd be millions of years old,"" it must mean that time ""slows aging"" on Sakaar somehow. So even if Hulk were on Sakaar for what seemed like hundreds or thousands of years, he wouldn't have necessarily aged.

It went from being a Marvel film that I was kinda annoyed with to one I had some genuine emotions toward.  It kinda sucks that I have to ignore some of the sillier jokes to get there...but damn, the characterization in the second half is some of the best in any Marvel movie so far.

I know it's no longer Joss Whedon writing Avengers, but after Guardians 2 and Ragnarok (both of which honestly had no reason to be as much of a comedy as they were) I just can't believe Marvel will ever take a serious tone to any of their movies. A lot of people hate Ironman 3 because of the whole ""Mandarin"" thing, but it's honestly one of my favorites from the MCU because Tony Stark has to literally deal with PTSD and his own flaws for at least half of the movie. It's a very *dark* movie to a degree. Even the first Avengers movie where Cap, Ironman and Thor are duking it out early on, it was a relatively gritty moment in the movie.

dpbchn0,"I knew it would have a lot of comedy going in. However, having comedy doesn't mean that you can't have drama, nor does it mean that serious problems can just be swept under the rug. 

A good example of this is GOTG. The movie had a lot of comedy, but it didn't kill the plot. Ronin still felt like a threat, the characters had their problems, and in the end, they saved the day and changed as people. 

There's also Spiderman: Homecoming. It had its comedy and a light tone, but it still had its points of seriousness and a solid plot. 

In both of these, the comedy didn't take away from the plot or characters. A big reason why people love GOTG was because of the comedy. 

My point is that Ragnarok's drama and stakes were buried under jokes and an uppity tone. When it finally decided to focus on something serious, it immediately cut it with a joke, or I found myself just not caring. The characters also weren't given much in the way of development or internal conflict for the sake of comedy. By the end of the movie, the main characters seemingly didn't go through any significant change, with the prime example being Thor's dopey wave as the new king of Asgard.

Right, but for me if the characters and the director doesn't take the plot seriously, why should I?

You can have an action film with some comedy in it, like The Fifth Element, but Blazing Saddles doesn't work if the villain is about to destroy the world.  It's too serious of a subject for the tone of the film.

To me, a big problem was the trailer.  I'd have to go back and watch it again, but I got the feeling that this was going to be an epic action movie with a little lighthearted stuff thrown in every once in a while.  The trailer is probably 20% jokes and 80% badass action.  Maybe I'm wrong, but that's how I remember it.  So I went in expecting that, and expecting it to dovetail into the previous Thor movies in terms of tone, and it really, REALLY didn't.  That felt like a blatant bait and switch to me.  Where was this badass struggle against Hela?  They spend more time struggling with Jeff Goldblum's asinine portrayal of The Grandmaster than dealing with Hela.  Does anyone care that Loki is a villain?  I guess not.  Doesn't really impact anyone's decision making.  Why does Hela have Skurge?  Exposition.  That's it.  It's not like she's busy.  She doesn't need a lackey.

Ugh.  That film was a mess...",7agfes

It's seems like something that would have hard to tell convincingly in a way that didn't seem stupid.

A movie about gods and space travel can be believable...see Wonder Woman or the 1978 Superman, both absolute triumphs of showing respect and lending verisimilitude to classic, alien, fantastical characters in the superhero genre, a genre that other adapters had chosen to lampoon and malign before and since...in projects ranging from the 1960s Batman TV series right up to Ragna-suck. 

What do YOU mean? You champion the absolute degradation and bastardization of a character who was just treated with a good amount of respect in Branagh's original Thor film. If you hate superheroes, we can understand that. Otherwise, you are betraying the fandom. Ragna-suck is a disgusting film that spits on and humiliates a character and his legacy. It is another continuation of what the MCU did with Mandarin in Iron Man 3, absolutely savaging the character's comic book history and turning the character into a stupid, unfaithful, dumbed-down joke. Ragna-suck is a horribly unfunny, very poorly made wart on the MCU.",7agfes

It's always nice to see the characters change and progress, I think the MCU does it very well, I just feel it was too much for Thor.

The only real exceptions to this were characters from the previous movies like Thor and Heimdall.

Maybe that was why they gave the Asgardians so little screentime. Or maybe this is just my imagination and I've been reading too many Thor comics. ",7agfes

No I'm not saying I hate it, but I just feel that it gets a little bit too oversaturated with comedic bits and breaks up the emotional moments too much with comedy.

Did we really need to see Banner splash down on the Rainbow Bridge as the citizens are running for the light from a gigantic wolf?

Thor and Hulk's interaction felt like their relationship has developed (although Thor never mentions how Hulk is now able to speak clearly). Also some action scene were cool (the first scene with Surtur, parts of the Hulk arena fight, and the final battle), but they were either blurry or blocked/staged poorly. The movie just had this weird feeling, like two people were directing this. Maybe it's just me. ",7agfes
dpbl98u,"Guardians' comedy is off-colour humor which I personally enjoy more. You might be right with GotG cut dramatic tension, but it never sacrifice character development for comedy. Thor Ragnarok doesn't care about any of the characters, it just cares about the joke. For example, Banner mentions that if he hulks out again then he might not be able to return to normal. Yet, the director decided to ignore this critical piece of information just to tell a joke. GotG has never done that. Gunn respects his characters and never turns against them just to make the audience laugh. The comedy part is just going to be subjective since I don't find Taika Waititi's comedy to be all that funny. Plus, I enjoy Guardians more because their character development is much easier to understand and relate to. Thor barely had a character arc and didn't feel like he when through any sort of development beside appearance. The GotG films are just better written films compared to Thor Ragnarok which is why I give it more praise. ",7agfes
dpboya2,"> I honestly can't see how you can knock this movie for its comedy and praise Guardians.

Because Guardians is supposed to be a little odd and kind of funny.  They're a bunch of misfits trying to save the galaxy; they get on each other's nerves, they put each other down.  Also, Guardians has humor, but it also knows when to cut the bullshit and be serious.  Do you see a whole lot of jokes in Yondo's death scene?  Or when Peter beats the shit out of daddy for killing his mom with a tumor?  Did they throw in an anus joke when Gamora is slowly freezing to death?  Guardians did it right.

Ragnarok... eesh.  The tone is just fucking all over the place.  Oh, Dr. Strange, you're so fun-wait, shit, Odin is dying, oh ok intense action scene with the villai-wait, ok Valkyrie is drunk and falls off the ra-oh wait, she's badass... you get the picture.

Ragnarok should be a big fucking deal.  Go back to Thor 1, you see how upset Thor is because he's banished from Asgard?  Yeah, now his home is being destroyed, his closest friends are murdered, and his people are being enslaved or wiped out.  Time for a joke!  Not.

The Hulk.  Banner ends up on an alien planet (somehow, his quinjet should be in Fiji?  No?  We're ignoring that?  K.), he's been trapped as the Hulk and brutally BEAT TO DEATH hundreds of gladiator slaves.  Remember when he flipped out on a town and basically had a mental breakdown over it?  No?  Neither does this movie.  Remember when Bruce Banner was a fucking genius scientist who had his stress/heart rate completely under control?  No?  Neither... you get the point.  And his scene on the bridge, all I can say is fuck the guy who wrote that.  Banner's been the Hulk for two years straight, with no real memory of it, wakes up on a world with no idea where he is, is pushed into the fucking destruction of Asgard, and despite KNOWING that he may never be Bruce Banner again, leaps out of the ship to save a fellow Avenger... and oh!  We need a joke, I guess.  Fuck.  This.  Movie.

The first Thor movie he's a fish out of water.

The first Avengers he's still all Shakespearean, but he's getting used to stuff and isn't so one sided.

The second Avengers he has settled in, hangs out with people, jokes around with Mjolnir with them, etc.

Maybe I just need to get a better sense of humour. I want to touch on Hela here too to finish off. Blanchett overall was solid, but the character was kind of cheesy to me!

They're just doing a nice of job of using the comics as inspiration, but adapting them into their own thing.  It's not a blatent rip off or retelling, and it's not an easter egg, it's just something nicely in between.",7agfes

dpgxf9n,Besides the opening and the tech what other callbacks? I guess the cameo of items on the plane but that’s nothing really.,7agfes
dpagrrs,"My problem with Ultron was *how* the quippiness was used.

Ultron rips a mans arm off in brutal fashion *and jokes about it?* Everyone went into the film expecting a cold, brutal killing machine, but what we got was literally an evil Iron Man with the same Tony-isms (it’s explained why, it still didn’t work for the character)

And every joke felt kind of forced, like they *had* to quip because it’s a Marvel movie.

Ragnarok was perfect in almost every single joke. Really the only one that didn’t fall for me as perfectly as every other one was when Hela gave her whole “I’m a villain” speech to the army of Asgard and then they ask who she is and where she came from to which she responds “seriously you didn’t hear a word I just said,” and that was solely because I feel like both Loki and Ultron had similar jokes. The way that “are you serious” scene was shot was fucking hilarious though, with it zoomed out and her just this small speck on the screen.

“Piss off ghost!”",7agfes
dpcnih5,"I didn't like AoU cause it felt like there were no stakes all throughout the movie. Ultron felt like a weak joke that posed near-zero threat to the Avengers directly, never having the upper hand in anything he did except kidnapping one of the weakest members of the team. Loki was similarly ""weak"" against the Avengers as Ultron was, but he managed to legitimately outplay them a number of times. And, try as they might, the destruction of that city in AoU will never feel impactful in my eyes - no dramatic weight, only a dry and convenient plot device.",7agfes
dper4lg,"I think the last joke about the foundation of Asgard was poorly timed. The joke on it's own is great, the execution has me confused. Is it supposed to be a dramatic scene or a gag? Either direction would have been fine, but it ended up somewhere in the middle.",7agfes

dpcys2c,"Right. I mean, I'm not surprised that they played it. But it felt like they gave away a pretty significant amount of the plot, and I was kind of dumbfounded. Either that, or they're planting deliberate red herrings into the damn trailer, just to get people into the theater... When they shouldn't even have to, anyway. I mean, it's fucking Star Wars. People are going to go see it. 

So much of that trailer just felt like, ""Oh, cool. Now that potentially powerful moment won't be at all surprising when it happens in the movie."" When they totally didn't even have to do that. Just show me a few shots of Luke and Rey. Finn, Kylo Ren, all the homies. Maybe a bit of the battles. Cool. But not with this narration of the characters basically saying, ""Hey, this is pretty much all the shit that's going to happen in this movie. Come watch it and give us your fucking money because it's Star Wars.""

I guess that came off kind of rant-y, but fuck. Aside from just not going to the movies, or literally getting up from my seat and leaving the room until the trailers have stopped, it's hard to avoid damn movie trailers. 

Plus, some trailers are actually good. The trailer for Downsizing that played before Ragnarok? That was great. Movie looks funny and interesting, and it looks like the only real plot ""spoiler"" they gave away is pretty early on, and forms the basis of whatever the plot is going to be exactly. It piqued my interest, and I'm curious to see the movie. Which is what a trailer *should* do. Not spoil the whole damn movie.

Also, I love Star Wars. Probably part of why it irritates me even more. Anyway, rant over lol.

Edit: Other good examples: Ragnarok, as stated above revealed enough to hype you for the movie, (Thor vs Hulk in a gladiator arena!) but didn't spell out the entire plot. Or much at all. The great moments in the film itself are too many to count, and most of them were not in the trailers I saw. (There was the ""We're friends from work!"" line, which was still funny anyway, but that's about it)

I also really dug the trailer for Pacific Rim: Uprising. Gave you just enough to get all hyped up, but there will still be that dramatic tension. (I'm assuming characters, either new or returning, will die) I really don't feel like it said anything about the plot at all, other than that apparently the Kaiju are on steroids or something, and that Finn from Star Wars (lol the actor's name escapes me atm) is an absolute badass. That's totally fine. It made me want to see the movie! But Idk wtf is going to actually happen. *That* should be the goal of a movie trailer!

But you get the point. You can do movie trailers without being an asshole, and I feel like Disney did not do that with The Last Jedi.

i just find that as an antagonist, certainly revenge however personal works great.  but if you're going to make a larger, ""epic villain"" especially on a comic book level who's supposed to honestly seem like a threat... then it seems you limit your options to world conquering, at which point the only way to flesh that villain out is to do what they do in game of thrones and give them some complex and self-doubt.

but when thanos arrives and mops the floor with the avengers, i feel like the only way it'll have weight is if they treat it like a war film, where a couple of characters are killed or wounded to the point of decommission, and the survivors are only survivors because they are rescued or saved by being sent away from the battle against their will, by a final self-sacrificing act from captain america, ending his movie run (until post-credits falcon is given the shield?)",7agfes

dr1bbrb,"If they removed some of the jokes it would still be a funny movie. Sometimes they felt so forced and fall into that ""so random so it's funny"" and ""I bet you weren't expecting that!"". The problem is that when the movie sets the tone early you do begin to expect some of the jokes and instead they just fall flat. A perfect example was Banner falling on his face instead of transforming into the hulk. Well we just saw thor earlier completely fail when he tried to break the window and he ended up smacking himself in the face. But these guys are experienced super heroes and they're not supposed to completely fail so it's funny!. I swear if captain America was in this film he would have smacked himself with his own shield.

Not to mention for a comedy there is a ton of death going on. Asgard blowing up was a pretty big moment. It was a place the viewer has become familiar with other the years thanks to previous films.

https://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/tom-hiddleston

This article is a Tom Hiddleston being interviewed by Benedict Cumberbatch. It is dated 24th September, a full month before Ragnarok finished shooting, and over two and a half months after shooting began. Surely the logical conclusion would be that this interview was conducted while they were on set together.
Anyway, the director of Thor:Ragnarok directed that after credits scene for Doctor Strange ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1211837/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ql_1 ), while filming that scene for the movie. It was a similar situation the Ant-man and Civil war credits, where it is a scene lifted from the latter movie added to the end of the former. Another point, Doctor Strange was released internationally before Thor Ragnarok had actually finished shooting. You aren't seriously suggesting that they set up that entire set again, on the other side of the world (DS shot in London, TR shot in Brisbane), and then just forgot to film the rest of the scene are you? Surely that would get most directors fired in the spot, never mind an ""indie""director.
As well as that, Chris Hemsworth was seen holding a card with Doctor Strange's address during principal photography : http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/entertainment/thor-ragnarok-brisbane-shoot-reveals-god-of-thunders-hunt-leads-to-dr-stranges-home-in-new-york/news-story/8f51b14fb29ba94a8a52f04ab5325a29?nk=ef2de73a31fe82b487142bd968daee0e-1511377776
 , so was clearly part of the plot from the beginning.

Let me make it clear: you are completely entitled to feel that it was tacked on, out of place etc, and for it to have taken you out of the movie. I'm not denying that. There are probably more people who agree with that sentiment. The point I'm making is that those scenes were not ""clearly"" added in reshoots. In actuality, all the evidence points towards it being in the film from the beginning.

dpf0y5q,"The implication might be the usual ""gods get their power from worship or just plain belief"" like ... Tinker Bell. 

The Gods of Asgard had commoners and other realms to believe in them and somehow suffuse them with power.

That may be the reason Hela was dealt with by Odin through covering her existence up. No one around to believe she was anything to give her enough power. 

When Odin passed on, he himself allowed Hela a way out: he became afraid of Hela, believed Hela could come back - that's one believer - and then he told his two sons. Hela believed in the power of Odin, too, and perhaps that was enough to prevent her from returning until Odin was gone.

As soon as she returned, her displays of power to Thor and Loki solidified their belief and her displays on Asgard immediately taught everyone that she was powerful, reinforcing her with their very fear of her.

But you may have noticed that Thor said more than once that Earth loves him. Earth has billions of people who may not worship him but who still believe in him. It's one of the nine realms. Odin even said it could be Asgard. The people of Earth believe in Thor as an Avenger. 

When Odin said Thor was more powerful than him, he may have been saying Thor's ""Asgard"" is larger than Odin's.

Thor wasn't working on 80% less power, he was carpooling to work with Hela not realizing he has a much, much nicer car of his own.

The people of Asgard may have also have had an inner struggle between being afraid of Hela and believing in Thor. The Valkyrie, Heimdal, the Executioner, Loki, and every other Asgardian were playing out Hela and Thor's battle within them, and deciding who they believe in more. Thor won that battle many times, and so he won the battle in the end.",7agfes

dpezzkg,"She didn't seem to be aware of it at the time. Thor only came to that realization at the end, so it's possible that Hela was going off the same incorrect assumption Thor had when she wholesale killed some of the Asgardians.

It isn't made clear how exactly the power is drawn from the people or how it's divided up. It could be that the power is a set amount that is just divided among the people, and that transfers to the survivors upon a persons death for all we know. We also don't really know what percent of the Asgardians made it out.  What is made clear though is that Thor is more powerful than ever even if he is only a fraction of what his power could of been, since he can now tap into his power without having to use Mjölnir to channel it. 

As to why Hela would fight Surtur, she didn't have the Asgard = people revelation like Thor did, so she might fight to defend what she believes to be her power source. She would also be kind of just stuck there with him, so fighting could just be a matter of survival.  ",7agfes

Disney also did this with recent Spider-Man trailers. In the trailer, there was a shot of Vulture swooping downwards in what looks like the lobby of a futuristic building. In the movie the same shot is used but Vulture is not in the same location. 

EDIT: I am trying to find evidence of this on Youtube. I promise I'm not making this up.

Hulk on Sakar is a beautiful green giant stranded on a distant world with Banner locked away within himself. It provides a platform for destruction because they champion Hulk's rage.

duo1st1,"I'm basically in agreement with you. I'd only add that we should try and be very clear what our criticism actually is. (I think you're trying to do that. Don't get me wrong.)

The criticism is not, ""You cast a white character with a non-white actor and I don't like non-white actors"" or anything like that. The criticism is, rather, that there's a clear hypocrisy at play in Hollywood when it comes casting and race.

>I could see the PR disaster that could arise from making Aasgard 100% white, even if that would reflect the mythology more accurately.

You're totally right. It would be a PR disaster. The hypocrisy is that if they applied the same standard to Wakanda (e.g., making Wakanda half white or Asian, etc.), everyone would be up in arms. 

So, again, to be clear, we have no problem with non-white actors or even non-white actors playing characters that arguably should be white. I'm a huge fan of both Idris Elba and Tessa Thompson and think they both did excellent jobs with the characters. Our criticism is hypocrisy: making white characters non-white is applauded, but making non-white characters white is decried.

I understand there's a history of whitewashing in Hollywood. And yes, that's a problematic history. But the solution to that problem isn't just to ""wash"" in different directions--or to arbitrarily regulate who's allowed to ""wash"" who. The solution is to dismantle all ""washing."" (What it looks like to not ""wash"" is an important topic, but I'll save that for another time.)",7agfes
dv694ca,"I fully understand the perspective you're coming from. However, with all due respect, who ever said that Marvel's Thor depicts a realistic or even accurate portrayal of Norse mythology? It's obviously inspired by it, but I don't think anyone at Marvel is claiming that the Thor series is historically accurate. If they were, you'd have a much stronger argument.

Also, the whole ""can't just shut my brain off"" is an absolute death knell to movie watching in general. I have a tough time reading IMDB reviews because most of the people reviewing insist on showing how much smarter they are than the film they just watched. It's asinine. The most common are criticisms of character behavior and decision making, because we all know humans are 100% rational actors at all times and *especially* in stressful situations, right? /s.

It's a movie. It's an artistic endeavor above and beyond the confines of reality. In addition, people in movies have problematic decision making skills in the same exact way as real people. Maybe not your hyper rational and morally sound IMDB reviewer with their gifted intellect, but it all ties into the same problem.

Truthfully, the best thing you can do is recognize that a comic book superhero movie incorporating Norse mythology isn't a historical drama, and that taking artistic license with the thematic source material is a given.

You don't have to shut your brain off to enjoy a movie, but you do need to let your brain recognize that Thor is not explicitly bound to ""accurate"" *mythology*.

In comics it literally was just a glove. Thanos just liked to accessorize as part of his grand master plan to lose (no really) but it has no special origin beyond being part of his typical wardrobe. It is not a legendary artifact.

dpd532h,"I love this theory. Right? Loki seemed liked he'd been there for weeks and weeks before Thor showed up, even though both were kicked out of the Bifrost close to the same time by Hela.

So if that's true about time dilation, then Hulk if he's been there for two of our years may have been there for 10-20 of Sakaar years. I mean, clearly there's a huge industry built around celebrating the Hulk when we join the story already. Consider he's been the champion for over a decade. That's why Grandmaster is so attached to him as well. ",7agfes
dpcxs6f,"> Early on in Sakaar, it is mentioned that Loki has been there ""for weeks"", although it seemed much shorter than that to Thor, who was only moments behind him in getting there.

I believe Loki fell out of the Bifrost Beam first while fighting with Hela when being beamed back to Asguard. Thor gets kicked off seconds later. I can only assume that whenever any object or being accidentally escapes the bifrost transport beam thing, It is considered as garbage and automatically transported to Sakaar aka the garbage planet of the Yggdrasil.

Due to the whole time dilation thing. Even though Loki got kicked out first, followed by Thor seconds later, The difference of elapsed time between them was massive. Literally, “Two weeks massive”. That means, Loki lands first in the garbage pile and is possibly found the same way as thor and gets taken to the grandmaster upon which he gets recognised and given a warm welcome. Something about the grandmaster owning loki a favor. Anyway, Thor comes in two weeks later and you know the rest..

> Hulk was gone for 2 years our time, wouldn't that mean he must have been on Sakaar for a potentially muuuch longer time in Sakaar? I can also assume that since Grandmaster Goldblum mentions ""in any other realm I'd be millions of years old,"" it must mean that time ""slows aging"" on Sakaar somehow. So even if Hulk were on Sakaar for what seemed like hundreds or thousands of years, he wouldn't have necessarily aged.

Interesting theory, I’ll give you that.

Maybe Sakaar is place stuck between places. Like literally a planet that is the end destination of wormholes. So in marvel cinematic universe, You go through a wormhole, You come out right off the devils anus.

Coming back to your point, In reality, The physics inside wormholes remain mysterious and even I have’nt a slightest idea how the Hulk landed on Sakaar apart from the cute childish way he explained it with his hand (representing the avengers ship) going down and a whoosh sound at the end. I can only assume he accidentally entered a random wormhole. Maybe a throwback to the way wormholes appeared in Thor the Dark World.

Anyway, Thor is the only sane one on Sakaar who remembers Earth and the battle of Sokovia, plus, at the beginning of the movie, he himself said he began searching for the infinity stones after having ragnarok dreams on earth. Again, We can assume he kept track of time. Hopefully correctly.

Also, At the end of the movie when Thor is seated in the Asguardian ark and he says the destination is Earth, I believe the E.T.A is 10 months or so. Oh well, At the end of the day it’s a marvel movie and nothing really makes sense. So better don’t give it a second thought and better to just sit back and enjoy the movie.

On that note, If the eta to earth is 10 months, I guess they would have arrived well in the middle of Infinity War 2. Again assuming two things, 1: Had Thanos not intercepted them & 2: Events of Infinity War have already began taking place on earth or soon would begin. Oh wait, I forgot the black panther movie comes before infinity war. So in MCU, While Thanos intercepts Thor’s ship, the events of Black Panther movie are playing out on earth.

Makes sense?

**EDIT:** Actually, Come to think of it, Hulk did age! When we last saw him in the Age of Ultron, Hulk would barely speak anything. “Smash” would be a word he knew. And now, Hulk could keep up conversations and understand information just like a 5 year old would.

Flashback to the moment when Thor angrily yells at Hulk, “For once in your life don’t smash” and hulk says “But...        Big Monster!”, it shows he’s growing. He understands good vs bad. Even without banner’s intervention. So for reals, This isn’t banner becoming the hulk and controlling him like say Tony does to his Iron suits, This is actually Hulk evolving and gaining his own personality. His own identity. No wonder he says he hates banner. Because hulk isn’t banner. Hulk is the Hulk.",7agfes
dpcyrao,"I had assumed the reason why Loki had been there for weeks was because he fell through the Bifrost a bit before Thor when Hela was pursuing them. I figured spacetime wormhole science stuff = Loki on Sakaar weeks before Thor. I actually first thought Loki and Thor would wind up in different places altogether. 

Then the Grandmaster said that comment to make it more confusing.

But I don't think Hulk had been there for a really long time (in Sakaar time) because the monument of his head on the champion tower was still under construction.

so much so that it actively negates the impact of surturs' destruction - they make a big point of the *people* watching the destruction, together, still alive - THUS i feel that the immediate, awkward (waititi style) humour, post-asgard blowing up is kind of alright.

that waititis' decision was to constantly undercut expectations by swinging ""wildly"" between serious and humour is actually (IMO) really refreshing ironically, where you thought the quips went too far, i feel that they were *great*, and of a better quality than marvels other films thus far - and went well with the wonderfully colourful cinematography/set pieces.

If Thor suddenly developed completely new powers and abilities out of nowhere I could understand the complaints, but these examples are so small and insignificant, they really don't detract from the enjoyment of the film unless you're specifically looking for reasons to dislike it.",7agfes
dpa03hi,"With you on the criticism of too much comedy. I don't NEED dark and gritty per se, but Marvel has gone off the deep end with way too much comedy undercutting so many otherwise serious moments. See: Korg making stupid comments as Asgard is being destroyed as one notable example. Guardians 2 was also too heavy-handed with both comedy and emotional beats, if that makes any sense, like force feeding us how we should be feeling at any given time. 

My only hope for the movies going forward is that T'challa is generally a no-nonsense type of guy, so hopefully his interactions are more tonally serious, and that the Russo brothers have done a bang-up job of balancing comedy and seriousness so far, so Avengers is looking to be in good hands.",7agfes

When he got to Sakaar, what series of events led to where we see him in this movie?  Did they force him to fight in the arena or did he choose it?

1. The comedy landed for me some of the time, but not most of the time. I liked What We Do In The Shadows so it's not just the style of humor. This is a problem when the comedy is often amplified to the expense of any dramatic tension.

2. The lack of dramatic tension. It's kind of remarkable just how little I was worried about any kind of stakes throughout the entire movie. Ragnarok is the punchline to a joke, then sidelined because the Hela conflict is separate to it, and then when it actually comes, they crack jokes throughout and it still doesn't have any tension. Maybe the moral is that Ragnarok isn't a big deal because Asgard is a people not a place, but it never feels like a big deal even before that message comes through.

3. Didn't think the Doctor Strange cameo added enough to warrant its own inclusion.

4. Score couldn't pick a thing. Is it gonna be synth based? Usual orchestral? 80s music? Maybe two would've been fine. All three? Too scattered.

5. Fights were too much arm waving and people going flying in big groups. No sense of weight or consequence most of the time, the Hulk/Thor fight and Hulk/Fenrir fights being exceptions. If a fight involved people who COULD wave their arms and send people flying, it did.

6. Movie spent too much time building up and building down from things to just do things. 

It was just overall too reliant on stuff that feels like it was pulled in to appeal to GOTG fans (crass humor, the classic rock, aliens) and cameo appearances and humor that didn't land. No dramatic stakes, no real consistency, it was just... not a movie I enjoyed.

dpeos5g,"I'm still not understanding where that's coming from. At the beginning of Ragnarok, Thor had refused the throne and didn't want any leadership roles, but by the end of the film, he has finally assumed his place as the leader of the Asgardians (which is a character arc started in the first film). He even accepts more of his father's spirit and teachings, which is characterized by his now-similar appearance. 

Thor's relationship with Loki has now been fully mended because of the film's events and Loki himself has finally broken out of his traditional trickster persona, which is evident by the fact that at the end of this film (unlike The Dark World), he didn't turn around and make another play. He has lost a bit of his narcissism, accepted Thor's faith that Loki can be a better man, and has pretty much now found true acceptance within his family and his people (another series of plot points wrapped up from previous Thor films).

Hulk/Banner started the film running away from everything that happened on Earth and because of Thor is now working towards getting over his initial hesitations on returning to Earth and doing something better with himself (which will probably lead to even more development in the Avenger arcs).

Korg begins the film as a washed down gladiator who has accepted his place in the pits, but by the end of the film has started a revolution on Sakar and fought for complete strangers against a foe way more intense than anything he's ever dealt with.

Valkyrie began the film as a drunk, ended it having regained her faith in herself and the Asgardians, having returned to her people.

Skurge started the film as an overlooked idiot who got roped into serving an evil person in a quest to feel noticed, ending with him sacrificing his life after his underlying problems with Hela push him to realize he could do more.

Even the Grandmaster has experienced change with the fact that his entire planet just rebelled against him and he is no longer top dog.

That's just off the top of my head. None of the main cast, and many of the secondary characters have experienced quite a bit of change over the course of this film, moreso than many previous Marvel movies. So unless you care to elaborate on how they're ""exactly the same"" I really can't figure out what you mean by that.",7agfes

dpbl3fe,"I don't think that it's just you.  To me, this felt like a movie that was written by committee.  It's way less than the sum of its parts.  

I thought that it felt like several scripts that had been cobbled together.  None of the ideas had much time to develop.  We are introduced to the idea of Surtur and Ragnarok, and then it disappears until the end.  Hela pops up, but then we go to this other planet.  We get involved with gladiators, but Thor doesn't go through the ranks.  He just goes straight to the final.  Then there's on uprising that we don't really see.  Then we're back to Asgard and Hela, both of which have a plot that hasn't really gotten much time.  Then Ragnarok again.  Like, this could easily be three movies, but instead, it's one shallow film.

Hela is a death god that has barely anything to do with death.  She's more like a murder god.  Shouldn't she just kill everyone in Asgard and lord over their souls?  Loki is the god of mischief, but barely creates any.  Hulk is the embodiment of rage, but spends more time cracking jokes.  Why was the Executioner even there?

I think that a lot would have been forgiven if I'd found the film funny, but I didn't.  Watching a comedy that isn't funny just isn't entertaining.  I was expecting a lot more epic with some funny moment mixed in.  There was very little epicness.  It was basically all in the trailer.",7agfes
dpc46nh,"I like Waititi's humor so just different strokes for different folks I guess.

As for the Banner development, I don't think the film ignores or downplays that information. Thor himself does, because he's distracted and focused on other things -- but that's very realistic for friends to kind of not be paying attention to something important because they're focused on their own issues, which is where the humor comes from. But the audience and Banner don't lose sight of it; after all the film does take a moment to recognize Banner making a pretty huge personal sacrifice to Hulk out and take on the wolf (I do wish they had nixed the stunt where he crashes into the bridge as Banner -- that's a cheap laugh that cuts the tension).

As for character development, I think you're missing some of it. Thor's already gone through dramatic changes in other films -- you're not going to see massive transformations in his character in every film. But he does continue to grow; he learned to be responsible and unselfish in Thor 1, but he still spent a lot of Thor 2 and its aftermath focusing on his own pursuits (i.e. Jane, going on his adventures in the cosmos), relying on his aging father to maintain the full responsibility of Asgard that he kept trying to pass on.

You can see in Thor 2 and the beginning of this one, Thor doesn't want the responsibility and messiness of leadership, and Hela remarks that he doesn't look like Odin (it's pretty clear symbolism that by the end of the movie he *does* look more like Odin). But over the course of the movie he is forced to find a balance between his own brand of uncompromising heroism, and the more messy pragmatism his father employed as a leader -- culminating in his strategic decision to destroy Asgard to save his people. By the end of the film he has taken up leadership, not because he wants to but because it's in Asgard's best interests -- this is a continuation of his growth because beyond just being willing to sacrifice himself for others in battle, he is now taking on even the responsibilities that don't excite or appeal to him.

There is also a great deal of growth in his relationship with Loki. He has loved Loki, he has been furious with Loki, but in this movie he moves to the extreme of being completely indifferent to Loki. He's grown up and moved beyond their sibling rivalry, which is something he implores Loki to do too during their escape from Sakar.

Loki is a bit all over the place, but that's very in keeping with Marvel's most insecure, mercurial, and confused character. He's never known what he actually wants or what makes him happy -- he just reacts in opposition to the things that have made him unhappy (being second loved, being denied the responsibility of leadership). He's really troubled by the fact that Thor has grown beyond caring about him, when Thor occupies his own thoughts and motives and inner turmoil. The book isn't closed on him one way or the other, but I think Loki took the big step of realizing that he does need to move beyond his simple trickster ways, and that he needs to find something else beyond conquering or ruling to fill that well of unhappiness inside. What that is we can't quite say yet, and I'm sure we'll see plenty of twists and turns yet with him, but I felt this movie did a good job of setting up a catalyst for change in the character -- that he's not going to be the same old Loki moping about denied birth rights and propelled by a childish, single-minded desire to rule.",7agfes
dpg5dz9,"I'm late to this comment but yes to everything you said. The Guardians came out of the gate insulting each other and being immature and so emotionally stunted, due to their pasts, that they can really only communicate with each other through snarky remarks and immaturity. But they care about each other, deep down, therefore I care.

Their circle talk scene in GotG lays out their individual personalities and that continues through Vol. 2 which is only 2 months later so they're still going to have issues. Yes the tape gag goes on too long but it shows how dumb Baby Groot is and it shows Rocket and Peter bickering. Groot ends up saving the universe, which he could not do if former Groot didn't sacrifice himself. Peter and Rocket make up by the end of the movie and Rocket realizes his friends won't abandon him. Similarly, the Taserface joke get played out but it fits Rocket's character to mock him and then mock Yondu (whose comparison monologue with Rocket later isn't interrupted with jokes). Taserface ends up leading the Sovereign to the Guardians, leading to Nebula frying them all (which wouldn't have happened if Gamora didn't save her) and that leads to Adam's creation. Every character and their action has a purpose in the story, even comic relief Drax is the one whom Mantis bonds with and because of that, she turns against Ego and helps the Guardians.

Comparing all of that with the characters in Ragnarok, I struggle to find arcs or development that feels earned. Thor bumbles around cracking jokes that, while funny, become the focus rather than ""save Asgard"" story. As you pointed out, Bruce's tough decision and sacrifice gets turned into a punchline. Valkyrie had excellent setup but she doesn't do anything to Hela, she gets knocked back and that's it. After what could be a century of hiding, she has her chance to fulfill her duty but she doesn't say anything to Hela and doesn't even give her a scratch. I don't remember anything about her development in the last 5 minutes except calling Thor ""Majesty"" and I actually forgot whether Hulk was still Hulk at the end (though that could be because I was still groaning over the ""foundation"" joke.) The Warriors Three died so quickly it kinda felt like a slap in the face. Thor doesn't even mention them. Odin peaced out and there was no fanfare or time to dwell on it. 

I do like the jokes and action in Ragnarok, it had good moments but the character work was overall sloppy and the story felt all over the place to me. Maybe it's because the Guardians movies are extremely simple and maybe that's even a flaw, but I honestly am fine with that simplicity, just as long as I care about the characters. And I cared about each Guardian, I bought their motivations and growth despite the drawn out jokes in Vol. 2. I could only care about 2 characters in Ragnarok despite the good jokes, and felt like the third act was a let down. Your posts nailed all the issues I have with this movie.",7agfes
dpbs7dz,"> Banner's been the Hulk for two years straight, with no real memory of it, wakes up on a world with no idea where he is, is pushed into the fucking destruction of Asgard, and despite KNOWING that he may never be Bruce Banner again, leaps out of the ship to save a fellow Avenger... and oh!  We need a joke, I guess.  Fuck.  This.  Movie.

While I disagree with most of your points, him hitting the bridge as Banner was fucking stupid as hell and unnecessary, as well as taking out the momentum of a good emotional moment. I also do agree with your criticism of their treatment of the whole Banner-Hulk dilemma in general. (""I'm always angry."" felt like the most bullshit nonsense Deus Ex Machina I have ever seen.) Some consistency would be nice...

Ah well, I do think Ruffalo gives a great performance regardless of how the character's written, and I enjoyed him in this movie more than probably any of the prior Marvel films.",7agfes
dpbp1w6,"I'll get to most of this in the morning, but in Gotg 2 (which I thought did a much better job overall of keeping tension than the first one, despite most people thinking the opposite), Peter shouts at his dad ""you shouldn't have killed my mom and squished my jukebox"". That seemed totally out of place to mention those two things in the same sentence as if they are of even close to equal importance -- so out of place that I can only infer that it was a joke that fell flat. They also did the pacman gag during that fight.

Edit (for the rest):

1. This movie was clearly supposed to be odd and funny too. You've got alien space gods in a colorful, chaotic cosmos. I agree with you that the first 15-20 minutes the pacing was in overdrive, but the movie settles in once Thor gets to Sakar IMO. Also Ragnarok isn't a big deal at this point, because as far as Thor is concerned he stopped Ragnarok in the very first scene. 

2. Thor isn't making any jokes in this film. The humor doesn't come from jokes or quips, it comes from the relationships between characters (for example, Thor being happy to see Hulk when everyone expects him to be terrified, and then his embarrassment when he turns out to be very wrong). I don't think any of that precludes him from being concerned about Hela; he's put in a gladiator pit against a supposedly terrifying opponent, and then he finds out it's his believed-dead friend? Absolutely that will draw a cheer from him.

3. Quinnjet is sloppy, but nothing a handwave about it being a different quinnjet can't fix. As for the other stuff, this movie makes it clear that this is not business as usual for Banner/Hulk. Their personalities are becoming more distinct. Banner has no memory or knowledge of what Hulk's been doing, and even if he did, it's kind of like it's a different person doing it whereas before, he always felt like he had ""one hand on the wheel"", so there's less residual guilt. And Banner was able to do pretty well keeping his stress down given the situation on Sakar.

4. I will say I agree about the bridge gag. Probably the one joke that I felt slipped into GotG territory. It was a cheap laugh and it cut the dramatic tension out of an important character decision.

5. Again, it baffles me that Ragnarok can be seen as slapstick and GotG humor done right. Thor had one dick joke and one butt joke. GotG has one very 5 minutes. The word turd gets thrown around so much you'd think there was a character called turd.",7agfes

I'm not a marvel expert but I think you're referring to 2008's the Incredible Hulk? I can't really relate with wanting more serious Hulk  pain in this movie. 

I agree with the other guy in that the humor here worked better than in GotG. Although I haven't seen Vol 2 yet. To me that movie was so hard to take any of the story stakes seriously.

Like in this movie when Thor gets captured on the trash planet, knowing that Asgard is getting fucked, you're hoping that Thor can escape and get home. Then a lot of the humor is about how deliciously evil the Grandmaster is and how fucked they are. Humor is pretty subjective so it's stupid to argue about but you're wrong.

Why did she have to hunt them down and not just interrogate them there? Why did she not grab the sword in the first place if she knew it was so important (that she thankfully spelled out for us).

dpcw8bb,"> the entire Thor mythology revolves around their belief of falling in battle, so they can go to Valhalla

Not in the comics. Yes, they have Valhalla, and they have Hel, but not all Asgardians are warriors. You're talking about Norse mythology, which in the MCU is just *based* on the Asgardians who visited Midgard, all of whom happened to be the gods, not the common Asgardians. 

Common Asgardians are all very strong and long-lived, but they're not on Thor's level at all. They're not descended from Odin's line. They have no godlike powers, and while some of them know a little magic or know how to fight (Asgardian soldiers for example) they also have people with more mundane careers. Healers, miners, farmers, artisans, merchants, performers (actors! We saw them at the beginning!) and more. These folk are not warriors. 

You have to stop thinking of this as being the Norse version, and accept that the comic book Asgard is a different thing entirely. The Earthly stories of Asgard are just that: Inaccurate, word-of-mouth stories that erroneously recount meeting a few Asgardians thousands of years ago.

Guardians of the Galaxy 2 was over the top with the comedy (Peter Quill?

dpas303,"Hulk and Thor have stalemated each other multiple times in the comics. That fight was fine. Thor got maimed by Hela.

Loki is a trickster and a magician, NOT a fighter. Valkyrie is an elite warrior, stuck on a planet of constant fighting. 

They had to outsmart Hela and beat her without brute strength. She's the goddess of death, and we clearly see she's a peerless warrior. Being Odin's first born made her more powerful than Thor AND Loki together, so they had to think about how to win rather than punching. I prefer that over another slug fest of an ending... especially since it was a Pyrrhic victory. ",7agfes

That isn't the point. I STILL ENJOYED THE MOVIE MY ORIGINAL POST SAYS THAT. The movie still would have been a lot of fun if they had let those 2 dramatic moments I talked about play out. They did an ok job with a couple dramatic moments. Odin's passing, as well as Skurge's redemption.  I don't recall any stupid comedy quips in either of those scenes, and they let us sit in some of the emotion of the moment.   But nope, they have to undercut so many other of the possible tense/emotional beats in the film with some bullshit comedy quip.         I enjoyed a lot of the comedy, but then there is just too much.

dpcjr7w,"> Thor's already gone through dramatic changes in other films -- you're not going to see massive transformations in his character in every film.

I really disagree with this statement because I didn't expect a huge change; I'm expected a character arc. It's a feature film, why wouldn't you include a character arc for the main character. Our protagonist should have grown through the movie, there is no reason to not include that. This is crucial part of feature length films and if you cut it out then you need a legitimate reason for it (ex. Dunkirk). 

>Loki is a bit all over the place, but that's very in keeping with Marvel's most insecure, mercurial, and confused character. 

What? Loki is not a confused character at all. He's only cares about himself and manipulates anyone just to get what he wants. He isn't the hero and the movie should sticked to his character traits instead of making him look cool. 

Here my point of view with these movies:

You need to give these character's arc and stick with the continuity. If you don't want to do this than stop making these movies. I want to grow with these characters and it's reason why I show up to these movies. Marvel is all about character, if you take that away you have nothing. Ragnarok didn't care about any of it's characters which is why I didn't care for it.

Also, Thor was never put in a position where he wasn't in power. He lost Mjölnir, but that didn't bother him much. Thor never felt like he was at his lowest point, which is why he never has a comeback. There was no stakes for him or Asgard. Hela never shows her strength or establish why we just be scared of her. Everything is told through exposition. 

I was expect a continuation since I have invest time in this franchise. I get that you don't personally care for it, but why wouldn't this movie not cater to fans when previous films have. Civil War didn't ignore TWS or TFA, so why would Ragnarok ignore the films that came before it. The director can have his vision, but it's the MCU with interconnecting plot points there is no escaping set-ups and pay-offs.

They only ever saw (or heard of) Odin, Thor, Loki, and the other gods.

This is unclear. Perhaps he had a change of heart one day?

> What does her title ""goddess of death"" mean? 
She kills so much she is the goddess of death. You have to remember that asgardians are just very powerful mortals that live a long time. None of them are gods of anything, they just have powers. Like why is Loki the ""god if tricks""? Does he control all tricks? no it's just his nature. Thor is the god of thunder because he has an affinity for lightning.

> Why is one of her powers the opposite of death - reviving the fallen solders of Asgard? 

It's not one of her powers. She used the eternal flame, which was kept in Odin's vault to do that. The eternal flame can reanimate the dead.

I think they did. You clearly see it in his face right before he jumps. It's not like he had a whole ton of time to monologue before he made his decision. Agreed that the slapstick was cheap and unnecessary.

As far as your second two points, those characters and storylines represented the last connections to The Dark World, which didn't perform well critically or commercially. Waititi and Marvel were actively trying to distance the new Guardians-esque Thor from the other semi-serious installments.

dpfan62,"Yes! Completely agree with all of what you said. Ragnarok landed more jokes than Vol. 2 but I connected to the Guardians a lot more, even in their first movie when they weren't as fleshed out. I like Thor but it felt, to me, like he was running in place for a lot of his movie and the focus was on him being funny and cool than learning something and developing. I think that's why I prefer Thor to Ragnarok, his first movie felt more streamlined to me and like it took its time to make him a hero. 

Similarly, when Groot sacrificed himself in GotG, I felt it. There was a long emotional moment dedicated to it. When Yondu died, it was heart wrenching despite him barely spending 5 minutes with Quill. When Odin died it felt hollow to me, a means to an end and his death fell flat again when Thor talked to him in the climax. I agree that Hopkins' performance was lackluster, felt like he didn't care. And it was (IMO) the lack of development. Maybe I just prefer boring talky scenes but I think they helped a lot in furthering the Guardians. Thor had a couple poignant moments with Bruce, Valkyrie, and Loki and I wish there was more of that. Thor didn't even ask about the Warriors Three or Sif!

Even though I knew, logically, none of the main Guardians would get killed by Ego, I still felt tension and worried about them when they were in danger. With the Revengers, I laughed and enjoyed the action but didn't feel as much worry, like when Thor lost his eye it came off as abrupt and glossed over. You nailed it with the potato chips comparison. I also didn't like the Doctor Strange cameo, it bothered me for some reason and the Thor falling, being clumsy with the instrument didn't help.

dphl164,"Actually, the only movie that really seems to stock to that concept of Asgardians is The Dark World. In the first Thor, and all the other MCU titles, they're aliens advanced enough to be considered gods. They are all born with incredibly powerful reality-warping abilities which make them synonymous to the things they are the ""gods"" of. Everything about their existence and technology violates, seemingly without harming, universal laws. I mean, just look as how their planet is shaped. Even Tony Stark called Thor at the least a Demi-God. 

Thor: The Dark World goes out of its way to make both Asgardians and Dark Elves seem more like aliens. Their technology now has displays and beeps and boops. Asgard has guns. Their boats have engines. As a result, the world has a totally different feel.

Now, with Ragnarok, were back to the old clarks-third-law Thor, where Asguardians can live for millions of years, they really are (for all intents and purposes) the Gods of whatever they're called the Gods of, and Thor fights mythological monsters like Dragons. No more beeps and boops for Asgard. No more guns. Even Odin referred to them as Gods here, it was great.

Zack Snyder makes movies for that audience already, and, frankly Chris Nolan nailed why they fail in the closing scenes of the The Dark Knight when he spoke to how sometimes people deserve better than ""the truth"" or what's ""realistic.""

What were Aries powers? When did she learn to fly? Isn't Zeus the god with lighting bolts, why could Aries use them? And if he could use them why would a bolt of lighting hurt him? And after the fight when everyone just hugged does that truly mean Aries was behind it all and man is good? Doesn't that take away the speech Trever give to her about man isn't always good and there is good and evil in man? The end was just a train wreck.

dpfjnl0,"And all 4 are demonstrably wrong. Hela draws her power from Asgard the actual planet, as does Odin, because that is the birthright of his first born, as literally explained by Odin. This can be a huge advantage to the point of being near unbeatable and getting to a point of easily wrecking Thor, but also somewhat of a risk, as per the events at the end of the film. Thor does not draw his power from Asgard because he is not the first born and never was. He'll never be as powerful as Hela was, but he also isn't de-powered by the destruction of Asgard, the place or the people. It does not matter about ""Asgard: place vs people"" where it concerns Thor's power because he does not draw his power from Asgard. Saying ""Asgard is a people, not a place"" is just a sentiment and is essentially just Odin saying if it is necessary to destory Asgard to destroy Hela and save the Asgardian people, then it is worth it. Thor's power is intrinsic as the God of Thunder. The hammer helped him channel and focus and tap into that power and he had grown overly reliant on it to the point that losing it made him feel near helpless. But he doesn't actually *need* the hammer (or Asgard) to wield his power, hence ""Are you the God of Hammers?"". He just needed to get his confidence back without having Mjolnir and learn to use his power without it, which is what he did in both the Arena with Hulk and at the end fighting Hela. However, even then he is not strong enough to defeat Hela on Asgard and it was necessary to cause Ragnarok and sacrifice Asgard. Odin and Heimdall both advised and consoled him on this decision by saying ""Asgard is a place, not a people"", which was not a statement about power sources. 

That's it. It isn't a plot hole unless you start to look to deep into the ""people not a place"" line, which was pretty obviously about what was important to save and not some riddle about power sources.",7agfes

In the very next scene we go to Thor and Loki in a room where Thor says he would hug him if he were actually there and Loki catches the object Thor throws at him saying that he is there and it cuts telling us they probably hugged. That scene does have emotional weight as their bond and dynamic as siblings is something that has been growing since the first Thor movie. That is something the audience would actually care about since that is part of their story and isn't interrupted by any sort of joke that would take away from the feeling of their growing bond.

the movie does NOT have enough drama in it to properly convey all of thor's warrior friends dying, his planet exploding, and his father dying. this plot is darker than empire strikes back, but you just chuckle the whole movie. you rightfully compared it to guardians 2, but that was always a different set of heroes with a different vibe. all avengers movies and other thor movies do not have this slapstick goofy tone.

This is the first Marvel movie since the first Iron Man that I've wanted to go see again — I'm a sucker for 80's neon and 80's ridiculous action/adventure movies and I felt like I was watching the neon-adrenaline fueled, over the top sequel to Big Trouble in Little China — and even I turned to my wife and said, ""Wait, if Ass-Guard is the people then how does destroying the planet do anything to Hela?"" 


It's like the left hand wanted to teach Thor a lesson about Asgard being the people and not a place while the right hand was set on blowing up the planet because Hela draws her power from Asgard. A single line of ""Hell draws her power from the planet itself"" would've solved the confusion.",7agfes

dpgb0rg,"She's the Goddess of Death, I guess there are a lot more dead. But let's disregard the worship/belief power stuff. Their power levels were not at all affected by the number of Asgardians or the existence of Asgard.

She fought Surtur because she thought Asgard was the place, not the people. And she believed her power was rooted in the place. She was wrong. Her powers were hers regardless, just as Thor's was. Just like his power wasn't the hammer, neither of their raw power was from Asgard.

Surtur probably believed the same thing that's why he attacked the place, not the ship. Surtur was going to end things when Hela was just starting her reign.

If the problem is just why is Hela more powerful until she isn't, the only answer you really need is maybe she was older, more experienced, angrier, and also, Thor wasn't trying as hard. I mean, why the power difference between Thor and Hulk also changed. And even in normal humans, the amount of strength a person can exert might be affected by circumstance and hormone release. Thor was just able to try *harder*. 

Disregarding all the ""worship stuff"" Thor may have seemed to get stronger, but Hela always had the upper hand even when it seemed Thor didn't, so neither of them got stronger or weaker. Just their exertions changed. 

When Thor realized going toe to toe with Hela wouldn't work because at best they're equal, he shifted to saving his people and distracting Hela with Surtur.

And when Odin says power comes from the people, it may have just been the power of the throne and the crown of Asgard, the same power a king would have. Even dead, Hela can create draugrs with the eternal flame. The people of Asgard are the only reason the king or queen of Asgard have monarchial power. 

You can read it thus: Thor was not trying to weaken Hela by destroying Asgard and severing some mystical power link. He was taking advantage of Hela's belief that such a link existed and using it to distract Hela so he can escape with the people of Asgard because whether or not there are Asgardians, Hela and Thor's intrinsic power levels were not going to diminish and they were too evenly matched and their battle will lead to casualties.

Thor was not afraid of losing his strength but Hela was, so she attacked Surtur because Surtur was a threat to either her perceived power source or her reign which he was going to end before it even began.

Asgard, the people of Asgard, nor the Surtur plan had nothing to do with the amount of superpower Thor nor Hela had. Odin was talking about the power of a ruler, a leader, the power to inspire either hope or fear in people. For a long time, Odin misunderstood until his change of heart. Hela continued to misunderstand. Thor understood just in time.",7agfes

She did have incredible magical strength - we saw that in her own combat. But of course, Thor is powerful as well. At the early point in the movie, he hasn't tapped into his full powerset yet. He's still an ancient Asgardian with incredible battlefield experience, but he's got lots of untapped potential. Hela on the other hand has even more experience than Thor, and was Odin's right hand man during the conquest of planets full of elves, frost giants, fire giants, and all other kinds of monsters.

Combine that with Thor blaming Odin's death on Loki stranding him on Earth, I think we can safely combine the two.

I don't think stories need to always hammer out every small detail in exposition.

Likewise, the film doesn't fully clarify the exact details of how Hulk got to Sakaar. We're told Sakaar is connected to all kinds of doors/dimensional portals. We're told unwanted things just tend to end up on Sakaar. We see a brief clip of what appears to be the Hulk being sucked out of the Quinjet. How did the Quinjet get to a dimensional portal? Why was it sucking Hulk out? Was the portal in space, or just in Earth's atmosphere?
