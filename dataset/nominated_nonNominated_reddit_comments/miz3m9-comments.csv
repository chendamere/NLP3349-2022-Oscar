gt7gpox,"The first twenty minutes of Anthony Hopkins performance should be enough to convince you of his Oscar. It seriously is on par with Silence Of The Lambs.

The movie is so unique as well, I have never seen a movie deal with declining mental health while intertwining intrigue in a respectful manner.

Shout out to Olivia Colman as well who was the glue to hold the whole thing together.",miz3m9
gt823x5,"There's a beat at the end where the nurse offers to take him out for a walk and I realised I couldn't say for sure that she's even the nurse. Maybe it's Anne, I honestly don't know. It's a really impressive indication of immersion when you've got the audience thinking like that.

Also, this is a more impressive and thematically appropriate distortion of time than Tenet, change my mind.",miz3m9
gt813ig,"No disrespect to Chadwick Boseman, but I really hope there's either a tie or Hopkins pulls an incredible upset. It's his greatest performance since Silence of the Lambs, absolutely broke my heart, and I won't forget it. Olivia Colman is yet again brilliant as well, and I wouldn't be surprised if she also sneaks in a few awards. 

But this is one fucking terrifying experience. Especially if you've seen a loved one go through this same experience. It also perfectly captures how horrible and frustrating it is to have to see it happen. 

Usually, in these types of films, we are looking from the outside in, but instead, this is more of a dementia simulator. The thought of losing my mind like that is horrifying and this film presents it in such a powerful and effective way that I haven't quite seen before. I loved it.",miz3m9
gt7jqaw,"Me, sobbing uncontrollably: ""Is that all you got, Hopkins""",miz3m9
gt7o199,This movie was absolutely fantastic. I wish more people would talk about it. Anthony Hopkins delivers one of his best performances of all time. That last scene from him alone is worth an Oscar.,miz3m9
gtbe6wc,"the central metaphor is placed on a watch, there is a loose grip of reality held by anthony as time is shattered fragmentation. he grows dependent on an object that is supposedly a reliable, tangible constant, but is unable to keep track of it due to dementia and time slips through his fingers quite figuratively and literally.

clever cinematography; the moving chamber effect inspired double takes at every juncture and led me, an able-minded and youthful viewer to grow increasingly dazed, confused, distressed. unexpectedly, i felt like i was watching a horror film, psychologically manipulated and scammed by false realities, leaving me feeling daft and dim. the father captured an inaccessible lens of the older generation, installing an unforgettable perspective that we often dismiss guiltlessly, without so much as a second thought. 

this film is a necessary watch for all. everyone has a parent, a grandparent, an elder in their life. corporeality can become so fragile and we will never truly comprehend the point of collapse until we witness it firsthand — and even then, we still only see a glimpse of the trauma, incertitude and fear real people face. however, while most of us can never completely empathize, but we could stand to gain from being more understanding.",miz3m9
gtf9btp,"Can we talk about the production design for a moment? The Father has one of the most frightening use of set pieces, colour, and architecture I've ever seen in a film. It’s not inherently scary (compared to say how a horror movie would use darkness, spider webs, and such), but the way the flat changes throughout the film instills just enough doubt to make you question if it's actually the way you remember it or not. The emphasis on hallways and uncertain positioning left me with only small pieces of a mental map of the space, making it difficult to even know where rooms are relative to each other. It's almost a character, actively subverting your own memory. Truly incredible.",miz3m9
gt7kvo6,"So many great moments where the director just blindsides you. My favourite was the dinner scene, it caught me off guard and watching it all play again was something else.

That ending as well was something I wasn't expecting at all.",miz3m9
gt7k9xg,Any other year this would be 100% Hopkins Oscar to lose right?,miz3m9
gt7txpr,Incredible film. Hopkins DESERVES that oscar,miz3m9
gt8bhla,"This was arguably the best performance of Hopkins’ illustrious career and that’s saying something when his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter exists. It’s such a raw and authentic performance. Hopkins captures the downward spiral of his character perfectly. The last scene is equal parts horrifying and moving. He looks so vulnerable in that scene, you feel like giving him a hug. The bit about losing his leaves would have sounded absurd coming from any other actor but man, does Hopkins sell it. Masterclass acting.

Also Olivia Colman’s performance will probably not get as much attention, but she is incredible too. She does a really good job of portraying someone who has to come to terms with the illness of a loved one.",miz3m9
gt8jhel,"This movie fucking devastated me.

I cried hot angry tears at the end. 

This movie is also a psychological horror film unlike anything ever made before.

Absolutely unreal. It rivals The Sound Of Metal for me, for best of the last year.",miz3m9
gt8h1ms,"A masterclass in acting from Hopkins. Excellent all around. 

One scene that I found very amusing was the scene where he kept asking about the husband's watch, and if perhaps he kept the receipt. I could also see this from the husband's side, it must be incredibly frustrating to deal with a person with this condition every day.",miz3m9
gt7qspy,"I can't think of any other film where the narrative structure is so deeply intertwined with the editing of shots, it was absolutely insane to wrap my head around. I can't even imagine what it takes to write a story like this, much less translate it into film, but it was done so masterfully. Definitely one of my favorites of the year.!",miz3m9
gt7izph,The ending in which Anthony breaks down and saying he wants his mother and that he only knows that he has the watch on his wrist was just so heartbreaking. Really couldn’t stop thinking about it for the past week.,miz3m9
gu7udru,"Fantastic movie. 

I haven't seen discussion yet on the chronology. I know this is really quite pointless since I know the point is that we really aren't supposed to quite know what's going on, but I'm curious how people are interpreting the events. I interpret the timeline as follows:

- Anthony lives alone in his own flat, has a quarrel with a caretaker named Angela (latest in a long line), which forces Anne and James/Paul to take him in (nixing the plans for the Italian vacation)
- Anthony lives (perhaps for years) with Anne and Paul (actually probably named James), but James/Paul's behavior escalates to abuse and eventually the couple divorce and she puts him in a nursing home. During this time, he also meets the caretaker Laura,  who looks like Lucy.
- Anthony lives for years (at least 5 because she's 5 years out from a divorce) in the nursing home, with Anne visiting regularly, but then she tells him she's moving to Paris 
-At the end, Anne has been living in Paris for months with a man named Paul

My thought is most of the movie is just jumbled memory, Anthony reliving painful events and supplanting faces, names and places, when he's actually been at the nursing home the whole time. 

The only thing I can't really wrap my mind around is how he's mixing up events that haven't happened yet, like telling the doctor that Anne is moving to Paris. I think maybe in the moment he said something confusing to Anne and then in his memory he's replacing it with the Paris bit. Thoughts?",miz3m9
gt8n7xt,"It’s there with Minari and Soul as one of my favorites of 2020. It scared the absolute bejeezus out of me. Everyone is rightfully raving about how insane Hopkins is — short of maybe Elephant Man, this might be my favorite performance of his — but can we talk about the production design and how every setting is the same set dressed differently to keep us in Anthony’s headspace, completely unsure of when and where we are? I felt my stomach drop so many times trying to make sense of it and realizing that part of the game the movie is playing is that there is no making sense of it. It’s an MC Escher painting; there’s no beginning and no end and no way to orient yourself, and that’s what Anthony is going through.",miz3m9
gt9r5ny,Anthony Hopkins was far too good in this film to lose the Oscar to Chadwick Boseman. His performance absolutely blows the competition out of the water.,miz3m9
gtfma0t,"This is a horror film disguised as an Oscar film. Jesus christ. I didn't think you could find a kindred spirit of ""I'm Thinking Of Ending Things"" this year.

It's acted wonderfully, the editing and direction is impeccable, the way that conversations and hints seem to repeat themselves is haunting, but...good lord, you are gonna feel like shit when it's done.",miz3m9
gta5jyb,"Now having watched this, I find Anthony Hopkins losing the Oscar, or any other award this year for that matter, to be a sick joke. It actually makes me mad.",miz3m9
gv6zmwl,"I watched this last night and at the end my wife is sobbing uncontrollably. After she composes herself as we are lying in bed and asks, “why would anyone ever watch a movie like that?!” And though there are many ways to respond to that I decided to mention all the people that no one knows about who are dealing with those suffering from dementia. Specifically the nurse at the end of the movie. There are any number of people just like her all over the world walking in to rooms with an Anthony inside - losing his grip on reality, responding sometimes violently and sometimes inconsolably. People who have been asked to take over for guilt ridden family members who finally get to a point where all their sadness is overwhelmed by their exhaustion and helplessness. It’s these people that sit next to an 80 year old crying for their mother, holding them until they forget why their crying and decide to go for a walk. I never thought about them, never had a need to think on them, and I’m grateful they are there.",miz3m9
gt7t516,Anthony Hopkins was phenomenal. He's my personal choice to win Best Actor this year (and I really hope he pulls an upset).,miz3m9
gtcth6l,"I saw this a couple weeks ago so glad to finally see a discussion for it.

Of all of the Oscar nominees I've seen so far (which is all of them except Mank at this point), I think *The Father* has stuck with me the most, even if it wasn't my out-and-out favourite. The film is just incredible; it is not often I'm moved to full-on tears by a piece of media but dammit, it happened twice here.

Much is being made of Hopkins' performance, and for good reason - it is a towering achievement. I absolutely loved Ahmed in Sound of Metal and would be chuffed to pieces if he won, but Best Lead is 100% going to either Hopkins or Boseman. I'd be happy with either, personally.

However, the structure of the film is probably the aspect which impressed me the most - it truly is like almost nothing I've ever seen before. As someone elsewhere in the thread said, *The Father* stands out because of the way in which it deals with mental illness - we're not on the outside looking in, as is usually the case, but rather right there inside Anthony's head and experiencing everything as he perceives it. It is genuinely terrifying and the use of multiple actors to portray the same characters, heightening the disorientation, is an inspired touch. I have heard this film being called a horror movie and honestly, I can't disagree.

Back to Hopkins though, my god. Understated one moment then brimming with ferocity and outrage the next, this is yet another reminder of why he is one of the all-time greats. There will be some who dismiss his performance as showy Oscar-bait, but that would be doing a massive disservice to his work here. He is the anchor of the piece, the reason the entire film works as well as it does. His vulnerability and pathos are why this is ultimately such an emotionally affecting story, and why the ending is so utterly devastating. In a lesser performer's hands *The Father* could easily have been an overwrought, overly-saccharine drama with no punch at all; as it is, it is one of the best films I will never watch again.",miz3m9
gt8bo7t,"I think this might be the best work of Hopkins' career, which is saying a lot.

I'd give him the Oscar over Chadwick personally (great performance though that was).

Chadwick will 98% win but given that the film just hit VOD and the voting deadline isn't for a few more weeks I don't think an upset is impossible.",miz3m9
gtgqoaf,"I cried like a baby at the end.  My dad is at the beginning stages of something similar and it hurts so much when he tells me something he's told me multiple times before, or when I tell him something and he doesn't remember it anymore when I bring it up.",miz3m9
gt7rdhx,Probably one of the scariest movies I’ve ever seen.,miz3m9
gthfzaq,"Something they tell you about dealing with Alzheimer's or dementia is that you have to accept the reality that those people are living in, not argue. Arguing and correcting Anthony drives a lot of the conflict in the film. I think it's a lucid person's nightmare of being stuck in a shifting reality. The story flowed well, and is worth a watch.

But definitely, being a caretaker is a very, very hard and stressful job. When Covid is over, I really suggest checking out volunteer programs at retirement homes because that human interaction is so important and people don't really have the opportunities in there.",miz3m9
gt8ur54,"Holy moly, just finished and I am emotionally drained and devastated. What a film.

Incredible both from the narrative perspective  and the performances. Any other year Anthony Hopkins would take the Oscar. What an horrifyingly honest look at dementia and the state of mind of the character. 10/10.",miz3m9
gta3v0g,I was not prepared for this film at all. Glad I watched it but wow it was tough.,miz3m9
gtev8p6,"Just finished watching it and i am blown away. The final scene where Anthony Hopkins portayed an elderly man reverting back into a child, calling for his dead mother was heartbreaking. It truly his best performance in a very long time and deserves that oscar imo. No one turned in a bad performance, Olivia was incredible too. The pacing of the movie is incredible and i was hooked from the first minute. The film was truly a mindfuck to the very end and displayed dementia in a way i have never seen on film before. I dont usually rate films out of 10, but this is truly a 10/10 film if i have ever seen one. Good stuff.",miz3m9
gtfxzg2,"This was it for me. I watched all the nominees, this was the Best Picture for me (followed by Sound of Metal) and Anthony Hopkins turned in one of the greatest performances of all time, let alone this year and the structure was brilliant. Ingeniously written and directed because every moment just served to heighten the emotion and the empathy of the movie and when you start to form the connections, it's not a puzzle for the audience as much as it's putting you alongside Hopkins suddenly realizing how confused he himself is, trying to course-correct. No part of it was made just because ""it looked cool"" or ""it's a big cinema moment"". Zeller just plays your feelings like a goddamn piano.

This was 90 minutes of being stabbed in the heart over and over.",miz3m9
gulxsup,"Anyone notice that near the beginning of the film, when Anthony listens to opera, the track skips and he then takes the CD out to clean the disc? Shortly after that, Anthony starts experiencing those looping scenes. A small hint placed by the director.",miz3m9

gugqwcw,Is it possible that Anthony Hopkins just peaked as an actor...at 83 years old?!,miz3m9
gu897ua,"At the end of the film it was revealed that Antony had stayed in a nursing home for many months.  I think he was abused there, possibly more than once,  (face slapping, etc.) by a male employee named Bill, showed in the ending scene.  Then Antony mixed up, in his mind, the abuser (Bill) with his daughter’s husband/boyfriend, Paul, just as he mixed up the female nurse with his daughter.",miz3m9
gt7v25u,"This movie is beautiful, and I repressed my memory of it. And they say the Oscars don't recognize horror...

gtc8yto,"The moment where you twig what's going on with the narrative and the actors is just devastating. Incredible film.  
  
I'll echo others. As great as Chadwick Boseman was in Ma Rainey, he had a handful of great scenes. Anthony Hopkins is absolutely the lead in this film and is utterly incredible. On merit, it's his Oscar. But I get the narrative is giving it to Boseman, but man Hopkins is on another level here.",miz3m9

gtbp927,Holy shit I was not ready for that. Read the description and thought it’d be your run of the mill Oscar bait depressing movie. Thought the acting would be great with Hopkins and Coleman but it would be pretty unremarkable other than that. Never been happier to be wrong. Incredible way to approach the subject matter that had me riveted and unsettled the entire time.,miz3m9
gte8v6m,"Holy fuck, I cried my eyes out and I'm not easily moved by movies usually, Anthony Hopkins is incredible, he's always been a powerhouse but he taps into a whole other soul wrenching level here.",miz3m9
gtnezkb,"(spoilers) I noticed that the layout of the flat & the layout of the care facility were basically identical, that threw me for a loop. & Anthony seeing his daughter Lucy's face in the caregiver woman... :(

The ending scene was obviously heartbreaking and perfectly acted by AH, but I also want to highlight the slapping & breakdown-crying scene in the second half between Anthony & Paul. Wow.

My grandfather had Alzheimers & I currently volunteer with elders who have intellectual & developmental disabilities, some with severe memory loss issues—this movie really nailed putting us into a perspective of a character dealing with the absolute HORROR and confusion of it all (assuming most of us have no direct experience). Like from one of the first scenes where he thinks someone's breaking in, only to realize it's not even his flat. Insanely well done.",miz3m9
gtnnep6,"Anthony Hopkins > Chadwick Boseman 

Sorry, not sorry.",miz3m9
gu04wna,"Heartbreaking performances by both Anthony and Olivia, but oh my god the final scene of Anthony in the hospital crying for his mummy.

That has to be one of the best performances I've ever seen.",miz3m9

gt9ziv0,"Sir Anthony at 83 is a goddamn force of nature. Everyone mentions Silence of the Lambs, but this film reminded me his performance in the Remains of the Day, absolutely legendary stuff.

gt88nb3,"This movie will make me cry, I hope it won't depress me too much.",miz3m9
gu093qw,"Really blew me away.

Everyone’s said it, but Anthony Hopkins is really extraordinary. He’s *Anthony Hopkins* so that’s pretty par for the course, but this is seriously up there with anything he’s ever done, and I’d argue probably the best performance this year, period.

Really loved everything about it. The directing, the dialogue, the acting, especially the use of the actors. It does a really good job of putting you in Anthony’s shoes and experiencing that confusion and not being steady on your feet, and the way the movie uses Mark Gatiss, Rufus Sewell and Olivia Williams goes a long way in doing that. 

Absolutely heartbreaking, and deserves all the attention it’s getting and more.",miz3m9
gteywxi,"Honestly, this movie is downright scarier than most horror films and more depressing than almost any movie I've ever seen. Not even in a balling your eyes out sort of way, moreso in the sense of utter hopelessness and the inevitably of the situation. It's a really good and well acted movie, but while  I can go watch something like Schindler's list or Come and See once a year and enjoy them, I honestly would feel  much more unpleasant going back to watch this again.",miz3m9
gtb74zb,"Compelling Drama about old age and dementia. Anthony Hopkins gives one of his best performances as an elderly father who is unlikable at times, but also empathetic and relatable too. The film is simple, but keeps you engaged the whole time and doesn’t outstay its welcome thanks to its short 90 minute runtime.

It’s shot nicely, the supporting actors give very good performances too, and 
you really feel for the characters. Of all the Best Picture 2021 nominations, this might be the best one for me. Sure it’s not the most original story ever, but it’s the execution that matters the most, and by the end it hit me harder than expected. This was great and I connected with it. 8/10",miz3m9

I was bawling during the ending sequence. 

Anthony Hopkins' spectacular performance, combined with the fact that my grandfather is currently in a similar mental state, combined with the worry that my parents (or even myself) might end up in that state... it was too much for me to handle.",miz3m9
guk4760,"That last scene contextualizes the entire movie so so well. The movie disorients the viewers and leaves us trying to piece together what exactly is real vs what isn’t, but for him, it’s just how his reality is now and he’s coming to grips with that. The sad harsh reality of it is that he may very well continue to have to come face to face with it over and over, as his condition deteriorates.",miz3m9
gu81zg4,"I was originally intrigued by this movie because I love Anthony Hopkins' work - the most recent film I watched before was The Two Popes, which I enjoyed, and by God this film did not disappoint. Like one of the above posters said the movie is a dementia simulator is a succinct summary. It gives a window into the mind of a person suffering gradually from dementia. I think what really got me was how the movie made me question reality/what really going on so well. I really thought I had a handle on what was going on, until I didn't. It really made me understand better what it must feel like to suffer from dementia and definitely have a better perspective about how this condition affects the mind. I think this should be required viewing for people in the medical fields to humanize this condition and show continued empathy to those who suffer from it. 13/10, and I really want Hopkins to win an Academy Award for his performance.",miz3m9
gv7gqgw,Hopkins gave the single best acting performance in like 5 years at least.,miz3m9
gva3kza,"Man, I was really starting to think that maybe Anne and her new husband were scheming together to confuse the ever living shit out of her father to get that unbelievably nice flat up until the end when it was clear that he just had no clue what day it even was.  


I'm still not completely sure what ""really"" happened in there but man.  What a movie.  Both my grandparents kept it together mostly right up until the end, but this really just hit me with an intense fear that one of my parents might end up as confused as the main character.",miz3m9

gw9fsp6,"While the ending scene is by far the Oscar winning scene for Hopkins, the scene that really kept me up at night was the dinner table argument. As a kid I've been in the middle of those arguments between my parents talking about my grandfather, who also sat at the head of the table like Hopkins I'm this scene.

But that twist of the conversation starting over in a loop...it made me think, did my grandfather ever live this sort of loop? Did he suffer feeling like a burden on our family and coming to this constant realization of being sick?

This movie was so difficult to watch but so important. I hate that it's being overshadow by the Oscars. I think it really opens a door towards compassion and understanding for those who suffer from ALL mental illness, not only alzheimer's.

A movie that left me thinking for sure 🤔

 I hope it's message and themes are to be celebrated once everyone calms down about the Oscars.",miz3m9
gvno5bk,"Was anyone left feeling it was you that had the Dementia. A clever bit of Directing put you inside the head of Hopkins character. 10/10

gvw6qbc,He got the Oscar... Wow,miz3m9
gt8rqsr,"I saw this in January and really, really liked it. I agree with the comments that in many ways it feels like a horror movie because you can never get your bearings. And it's so terrifying to think that people with this condition have to exist in that limbo all the time - always feeling like things are off, never quite being sure what's real or not, losing time, forgetting those closest to them - and it only ever gets worse. It was a very upsetting watch and brilliantly acted by Hopkins and Colman. I felt particularly bad for Colman's character having to deal with that awful ex-husband who was completely unsupportive. Like I get why he's frustrated but there's no reason to be so cruel to an old, sick man or his wife. I'm glad she divorced him. 

The editing in this film was incredible and made me really curious as to how it played out on stage as it started as a play. I think of the three play adaptations that were in the running for the Oscars this year, this one is the one that most transcended that structure. 

Interestingly enough, old people crying really gets to me. It *always* makes me cry but the one scene in the film that rang a bit false for me was the scene at the end when Hopkins' character starts crying for his mother. It makes sense that he has now reached that point but it didn't feel as authentic as everything that came before it. Clearly i'm in the minority on that one though but it's still a tremendous performance. 

A lot of the Oscar films this year just devolved into acting showcases to me instead of feeling like whole films in their own right (Ma Rainey, Pieces of a Woman, Hillbilly Elegy) but this film managed to be both. I hope we get to see a lot more work from Florian Zeller.",miz3m9

I truly do believe that Boseman deserves and earned that Oscar for many reasons, but Hopkins is a strong contender and I was glad to see the BAFTA’s recognized him for it.

I don’t know if I could really recommend this film to anyone who has watched a loved one struggle with memory loss - definitely be aware of what you're getting into - but despite the pain I felt, this was just an incredibly well done movie on all fronts. Script was A+, Hopkins was at the top of his game and Coleman delivered as she always does.

Now I’m off to watch something happy, lol, I need that.",miz3m9

gv5y2ac,"As many have said but I'll summarize my thoughts, I think that this is the best performance from Sir Anthony since Silence of the Lambs and I'm hard pressed not to give him the oscar despite the tragic passing of Chadwick. But I personally think this is his scariest performance ever. Even more so thank Lector because of how real it is. Not to say that Lector isn't real because he certainly has his basis on real people but his performance in The Father is so accurate to the very last detail of someone with dimensia that it is heart breaking. So much so that this is one of those films I think everyone should watch once and then never watch again 9/10",miz3m9
gv8sokf,"I have clearly been watching too many insane shows and movies, because this is what I thought was happening for about the first half hour (keep in mind, I went into this film cold, no previews, no movie reviews, no idea what even the basic story was):

In the first scene, we don't know yet that Hopkins ISN'T in his own flat. It also isn't entirely clear yet if he's delusional/suffering from an affliction, or if rather he's just your typical stubborn, temperamental elderly man who refuses any help, even from his children. AND he's kind of an asshole to Anne in this scene (cold at first, then passive aggressive/manipulative), and REALLY cruel to her in the scene with Laura (calling her stupid, comparing her unfavorably with her sister, etc.)...

With all that, my impression would be that it turns out he is NOT delusional, but rather he's just a bad father who manipulates Anne, controls her life, belittles and insults her, destroys her relationships, etc...and so as revenge, because he's already not QUITE with it due to old age, Anne plays a huge, elaborate trick on him to make him THINK he's totally delusional and force him into a home. I especially thought this after I hit pause on Amazon Prime and saw that Olivia Williams' and  Mark Gattis' characters are called ""The Woman"" and ""The Man."" I thought: Ah, they are playing ACTORS, strangers hired by Anne to pretend to BE Anne and her husband or ex-husband , say things to Anthony Hopkins that they then UN-say in the next scene; have them disappear randomly so that he appears crazy for having seen them; mention food is on the table and then deny they ever said it and remove the food; feign confusion when he mentions anything he has heard them say, etc. 

Then I thought that Laura, too, was hired by Anne to pose as a caretaker (since Anthony has presumably fired every caretaker in the past, to Anne's unending exasperation), and that she'd engage in a battle of wills with Anthony until he's finally defeated and convinced he NEEDS to enter the home. 

Again, it was Hopkins being so mean to Anne, and her obvious hurt from it, that made me think these machinations were in play. It was only after they started making his character increasingly befuddled/helpless, and especially after they demonstrated that, cruel as Anthony can be, Anne's ex is far worse, that I started putting the pieces together.

It's a great, clever, unsettling movie, with a great conceit, but part of me wishes it WAS that fucked up. Sort of like this Martin McDonagh play I love called  *The Beauty Queen of Leenane,* where this unmarried 40-something woman is caring for her impossible insufferable mother (who has our sympathy because of her affliction but we can see how difficult it would be to care for her). The movie flirts with some of those complexities but doesn't go all out which is why I found the ending, heartbreaking as it was, a little maudlin/pitying for my tastes. But man, all the performances are top notch. ALL of them.",miz3m9

What if Olivia Colman’s appearance in the movie is actually how Anthony’s mother looked? Similar to how Laura’s appearance was at first that of his daughter, Lucy.

It is so confusing and disorienting and even though I KNEW that was the intention of the film, I found myself getting angry as my confusion grew. I wanted it to just stop and become clear, I needed explanations. 
I feel like I have a whole new respect for what my clients go through. I knew what dementia was, experienced exactly what Anne went through with her dad NUMEROUS times over 5yrs at my job, yet this movie gave me a new level of understanding and also sadness. I had no idea certain things felt SO real to them, and the part when the morning transitioned to 8pm in what felt like 2 minutes was shocking to me.

I also loved the unique flow and storytelling of the movie. We indirectly got a glimpse into how time had passed before finally winding up at the hospital with Ann living in Paris. It showed us that Ann did try caregivers for a while at her father’s flat, that they did move the father out, and that he did stay for a while at Ann’s flat resulting in her divorce and unhappiness- which years later transformed into finding a new love and life in Paris.",miz3m9

-the look on every person's face when they interact with Anthony is crushing. The pity and unease masked with politeness.

-the abuse scene. Elder abuse is all too common, and the unanswered question about whether it was the nurse or the partner was powerful. 

-this was the best use of disjointed narrative that I've seen in a film, outside of Nolan's best films. 

-ive been in the carer's position trying to support someone to take medication, and seeing it from this perspective shook me to the core

-as others have said, the changing set design was masterful and subtle 

-And of course Hopkins. His charm shining through and withering away over the course of the film was really upsetting, and of course that final scene just broke me.",miz3m9

1- the scene where Catrine tells Anthony your daughter brought you some coffee to lie about her regular visits that never happened since she left her dad in the nurse home. 
2- The final scene where Anthony is crying like he is his kid version playing in the rain the leaves are actually a sort of indication of his brain cells which are attached to the branches which are the neurological veins, so he is losing his brain cells everyday and make his dementia even worse. The result is we feel unattached somehow to the world and weightless. He says ""I have no weight to put my head anymore"".

Also loved the common set layout that was used for almost every scene. I’m guessing this was pretty critical on stage but love that it was carried over to the film since I think it helps add to the confusion over where the events are actually taking place. 

Still have 2 more movies to try to get through before the awards, but was kind of surprised to see Nomadland was by far the favorite to win. It was alright but I’d probably put it 3rd or 4th from the movies I’ve seen so far.",miz3m9

From a technical perspective you can appreciate the fantastic acting and the story telling. The way they used the characters and the actors was brilliant. You follow along the story and then you don't, or do you? It's not really a detective story or a mystery and I think it's made worse if you try to pay attention and pierce together a coherent time frame or story arc. You're given bits and pieces but everything is unreliable...or is it?

From a personal level, especially if you've lost family members to dementia or just old age then this movie cuts way too close for it to be enjoyable in any sort of way.

gx4fsmm,"In my very unprofessional opinion, this movie was marketed all wrong. The font, the posters, the cast, the music and the colors in all the ads made it look like the most boring Best Picture nominee, even moreso than Nomadland. What it ended up being was more akin to a horror film, and if I'd gotten any semblance of that from the ads I'd have leapt to see it earlier rather than pushing it off. I likely never would have watched this if Hopkins hadn't won, and that's 100% on marketing. I get that I'm not the ideal audience for this, and they're selling it to older Oscar buffs who really like The King's Speech, but still, it is what it is. 

There's a type of confusion I can accept from films and a type that really gets on my nerves, and this one rode that line a little. It wasn't Primer, where the whole thing's just a damn puzzle, but there wasn't exactly a one-to-one understanding of what you were seeing on the film was supposed to represent as happening. If you make the narrator (so to speak) too unreliable, if they lie to you and are inconsistent in what's legit and what's fake, eventually it gets too meta and my brain just defaults to ""what I'm watching is the Actor Anthony Hopkins on a set."" There has to be some idea of what the official ""real"" canon of the events in the movie is. I think by the end we finally got that, or at least, I got enough of it to ignore the scenes I'm still fuzzy on.",miz3m9

But he hits another level in this film that I think is a cut above those performances.

I just finished Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom last night and gotta say that Chadwick definitely earned it. There will be some revisionist history saying he wouldn’t have gotten it if he hadn’t passed away and that might be true but it was an incredible performance and it’s not like they’re awarding him for 21 Bridges.

gv9zfcb,"Just watched the movie so I’m late to this, but I’m also wondering about the timeline and didn’t see it mentioned anywhere else.

I’m also thinking he sees events that haven’t happened yet because the perspective is from his end point at the nursing home, so it’s all in the past by then. Like you said it’s intentionally unclear, but that’s the only way I can make sense of it. That would also explain how the home’s staff appear as other characters from before he relocated.

I was initially confused by James vs. Paul, but I also interpreted the abusive scene as James right at the end of Anne’s marriage.

When the man we eventually meet as Bill introduces himself as Paul early on, it’s shortly after we hear of Anne’s plans to move to Paris. She may have told Anthony she was moving in with a Paul in Paris, which set that moment of confusion up.

Whether or not sorting this out is the point, I still find it interesting. The Father had unconventional mystery and horror, and I did not expect either going into it at all.",miz3m9
gvn7ggo,"I agree with this timeline.

During the movie I couldn't make sense for why it looked like events were looping in his head, or almost like a premonition (I knew it was dementia, but still...). But at the end I came to the conclusion that the whole movie, or atleast all the scenes where Anne isn't alone, happen in his head.

He is remembering those last key moments of his life, you might think they are mundane but thats the life of someone with a mental illness closed indoors all day, every day. It's all about drinking tea, having dinner, overhearing discussions. So it all plays out on his head like memories, but he has trouble piercing his memory back together, that's why he places the caretakers at the nursing home in his memories, because it's who he sees every day and who he remembers. It's also why he mixes Lucy with the caretaker, he knows he had a caretaker but all he can think of is his daughter face on her. It's also why the layout of the nursing home is so similar to his ""house""",miz3m9
gw2co8n,"I might be mistaken, but after recently watching the film I thought there was a period in between Anne’s husband (possibly) hitting Antony and Anne’s move to Paris.

So, when I was watching it, I thought it was:
- Antony lives in his own flat. The Angela fallout occurs and he lives with James/Paul and Anne.

- During this time, they find a new caretaker named Laura. This goes on for a few years but there is another fallout. James/Paul get fed up with Antony (possibly hitting him as a result).

- Then, Anne and James/Paul get a divorce. (This is where I’m most confused.) I thought there was a period where Antony and Anne are living together in Anne’s own flat (away from the now divorced husband). She again is trying to take care of Antony. She takes care of him for a while — going to get groceries, taking him to the doctors, etc. But, somewhere, she starts to realize his mental state is decaying rapidly. Parallel to this moment, Anne has met someone named Paul in Paris. She decides that she must take him to a nursing home and start living in a more detached manner from Antony (although she seems him every weekend).

- And, lastly, Antony is by himself in the nursing home. This is where I suspect (like most others do) the entire film takes place.

Yes, Anthony was in a nursing home reliving his memories in various states. Not necessarily in chronological order as some parts were of recent Anne and other parts were of younger Anne.

gwkhmzg,"Absolutely incredible movie. My theory on the interchanging actors is that you are seeing what he’s seeing/remembering up and through the very end, including the face of the nursing home caretaker “Catherine” not being her actual own. This is a real caretaker who helps him every day, and because of that, he sees the face of his daughter, Anne, on that caretaker. And yes, the real Anne is NOT Olivia Colman, it’s Olivia Williams. The face of Olivia Colman supplants most of his memories of Anne, his daughter, but Olivia Colman’s face is in reality that of his mother.  As mentioned several times in these threads, those suffering from dementia and memory loss long for their mothers. Our memories of our mothers caring for us is probably the most primal and deeply embedded memory we have. There is a very telling moment in the film when he looks at a framed picture of himself with his two daughters, Anne (Olivia Williams) and Lucy (Imogen Poots). I think that picture is the only firm representation of who Anne and Lucy actually are. Lucy died. Anne eventually went through all of the heartbreak of trying to care for Anthony, the conflict with her husband, the divorce, trying to take care of him on her own, eventually committing him to a nursing home, getting some semblance of her life back, finding a new relationship and moving away, coming back on weekends to visit with him.  We see Olivia Colman doing these things because he’s assigning the face of his very first caretaker, his mother, to his prior caretaker, his daughter, who is no longer in his daily life. He assigns the face of his daughter, Olivia Williams, to his present caretaker, Catherine, because that’s who he associates with the idea of being cared for most recently, the last 10 years or so. The whole narrative here is reliable on what happened, but unreliable on when it happened and the faces of the people.",miz3m9
gvaeabp,Me neither. It was such a great film. Glad you interpreted it similarly.,miz3m9
gvwxqab,">I’m also thinking he sees events that haven’t happened yet because the perspective is from his end point at the nursing home, so it’s all in the past by then

I don't think you need to worry too much about sorting everything we see. The story isn't told entirely from his point of view, which would be impossible anyway as the movie can't force you to forget things, which would be the real way to simulate dementia. In 'reality' he would deteriorate over time, but our understanding of what's happening as audience only increases as the movie goes along.",miz3m9

gt80leo,"Honestly, I thought it was the orderly.

1) Every scene he appears in he's flat-out threatening and creepy. It basically turns into a fucking horror film (not that the rest isn't just as unsettling) when he's on-screen. 

2) Even before he does anything, the second Hopkins sees in he becomes afraid and confused. As in it could almost be seen as intuition even if he doesn't realize it. 

3) When the orderly appears at the end he just gives off a ridiculously creepy vibe and seems to glance at Hopkins with some weird, borderline sadistic glee in his eye. But this honestly could be just because of how he's portrayed in every scene before it, and we're literally seeing everything from Hopkins POV. Or maybe I'm reading too much into it. 

4) But, it does tie into the theme of elderly abuse that is disturbingly way too common in care centers, which is mostly done by the authorities/staff/orderlies. Not saying all of them, obviously,  but there are way too many videos on youtube and other true reports about it. Which is the worst fucking part of all.

You have to strike a balance and I suddenly felt like I was watching an actor trying to convey complete emotional distress in that moment instead of seeing Anthony (the character) reaching his complete breaking point.

gv7gxsw,It he didn't die I'm sorry that role wasn't worthy of even being nominated.,miz3m9
gtahy22,Of course he would have been nominated.,miz3m9

hesbwag,"Ooh, I love this! It really added poignancy",miz3m9
gv03wvb,"Probably, yes. The question is was it him or the carer?

Those with dementia get confused but don't tend to be delusional like with say schizophrenia. So some level of elderly physical abuse was likely.",miz3m9
hrvtvrj,Bless you for being there to comfort them.,miz3m9
gvep4ye,No that's the end. Yeah Anthony Hopkins just cries even more. You stopped at the right spot if you couldn't handle it. No she doesn't return from what we see. We only hear that she visits once every few weeks,miz3m9
gyzhnt2,"That was the ending. I just finished watching it and I'm still trying to stop crying. I've worked in LTC for over a decade and this movie *hurt,* especially the end when he just wants his mom. Goddamnit I really need a fucking hug right now. Best movie I've seen that I never want to watch again.",miz3m9
i3g0jww,"Thanks for this writeup. I tried to catch a few good glimpses of the photos but it never stayed long enough for me to confirm the faces, very much on purpose of course.

Definitely makes sense about why he confuses the faces so much as well. Highly appreciated.",miz3m9
gvwmr7t,I’m still not sure whether it was Bill the nursing home worker or Paul/James slapping Antony.,miz3m9
h4s8ldx,Agreed. You literally cannot compare anything else to this.,miz3m9
i3g244r,"Bingo. I've heard so much about how well nursing homes treat the elderly now thanks to these insights that took oh so long to become well used versus looking at them in a cold, clinical, logical fashion, when their brain is anything but logical.

There's a reason why nursing homes are no longer cold clinical hospitals but more country clubby. Decorations everywhere and just letting those with dementia be demented and not try to force a reality on them resulting in anger that their mind genuinely cannot comprehend.

It sucks that elder abuse is a thing, and you can tell that it was acknowledged in the film even. It's one of the hardest things a family caretaker can go through in life, and it didn't skirt how much it can affect interpersonal relationships around you either.

I still have a mother that says she absolutely refuses to stay in a nursing home and I've had to tell her that before that I don't want the end of my life trapped in yours. Thankfully she still has all her faculties and I'm pretty sure she will end up offing herself if her mind went that route. To be honest, I can understand why, and I bet so many others can too after seeing this film. So many people around my mom's age and area grew up with so little besides their pride. When they're stripped of that, it's a fate far worse than death and I would never judge someone taking their own fate in their hands like that. I'd be sad of course, but at least I'd understand.",miz3m9
iik6w94,"Oh yeah, the screenwriters/people involved with this had so many things play out that I've remembered or experienced when some of my loves ones went through dementia. Made it all the harder to watch by the end, and as much as it was brilliant unsure if I should recommend it to watch...",miz3m9
gtanhv7,"> Its decision to not criticize Amazon will look quite silly in a few years.

Do you mean Nomadland's positive portrayal of Amazon? I did think that was weird, but assumed they were a major sponsor of the film.",miz3m9

Out of the past 6 years, 3 black people won an acting Oscar.",miz3m9
gvji4hz,Well I’m a doofus!! Sorry.,miz3m9
gt7ytln,"Yeah the movie pretty clearly takes place over the course of a few years. It seems everything more or less happened, but obviously details are unreliable",miz3m9
gt8oyww,"One of the things that happens to dementia patients is that they build and hold onto delusions or stories they just make up.

I don't think Paul ever abuses him but they're obviously antagonistic to each other and that just cements Hopkins beliefs and delusion as his dementia progresses. In his mind, he's built up this escalation. Even if Paul did hit him, how would you be able to differentiate whether it was the character or the actor?

At the end, the only thing we know is that Hopkins has a watch and that's it.",miz3m9
gt8g06q,I think you are reading too much into the fact that Mark Gatiss is kind of a creepy looking man.,miz3m9
gt8c76f,"Interesting. One of the reasons I don't think it's the orderly is because Anthony mixes him up with a fictional husband/partner character. The scenes with the watch and the dinner are most likely fictionalised and paint him in a bad way.

Also slapping him would eventually leave marks or swelling and seeing how close Catherine is to him, I'd think she'd notice.

I thought at the end he was just a normal guy lol. He comes in and says hello and then leaves. But I also guess since that the brain can't make new faces, Anthony used his. 

And thats one of mysteries of the film with an unreliable narrator, how much truth is in every scene, how much is him speculating before his mind went and how much is a dream/nightmare.",miz3m9
gtc61b4,That was my read as well.  You expressed it far better than I could have though...,miz3m9
gwa1z7x,"I made mistake in the original comment, I assumed Paul was her husband. I think you’re mixing up the boyfriend and Paul. The Parisian boyfriend isn’t seen in the film. I interpreted it as Anne leaving Paul",miz3m9
guwp0yw,"I totally agree with you and I'm glad it wasn't just me. There is that particular point in it where I was just suddenly acutely aware that I was watching an actor, not a character.

gvjrb11,I’d say Heath Ledger would have won regardless.,miz3m9

gw6r3o9,"While his death may've pushed the performance pretty much over the finish line, I believe even without a death, Ledger was winning.",miz3m9

gv14iug,"When Gatiss appeared as the care worker, I had the same thought.",miz3m9
h1p0v9j,The appearance of “Bill” in the closing scene really seemed to trigger Hopkins’s character unwinding to the degree of begging for his mother. I think the abuse was strongly implied.,miz3m9
hrwhhw9,"Thanks, some days we're definitely a trial to get through the shift without losing my shit in the linen closet.",miz3m9
gwtg273,"""Occasionally""",miz3m9
gvwxtb7,"The husband definitely slapped him, imo. There's a clear arc where he becomes increasingly frustrated with him, and then right after the slapping scene we see the father and daughter living in an apartment that feels smaller, which connects the slap to the divorce pretty strongly and shows the toll the situation has taken on her.

The nursing home worker might have. Using the same actor certainly *alludes* to elder abuse in nursing homes, and generates the emotional response in the audience. Doesn't have to be real, though, and there's no arc or anything there, the nursing home worker isn't an actual character. If anything it's the female nurse that seems a bit dickish, but her 'arc' ends in a very different place.",miz3m9

The movie entirely skipped over the original book’s criticism of Amazon.",miz3m9
gtc983z,"Reread the ""current political narrative"" bit.",miz3m9
guwo5as,"The thing is that AH's character has dementia not schizophrenia. I therefore think that *somebody* did indeed hit him, the question is who? 

I personally think it is as straightforward as the piece of shit husband abusing him. The divorce then took place and she subsequently met the French chap and moved to Paris. Occam's razor.",miz3m9
gvo1oiu,"It's actually in the script that ""The Man"" (the official name of Gatiss' character) is really menacing and intimidating, and that his appearence (either as Paul or Bill) always immediately puts Anthony on edge.",miz3m9
gxjqh3j,"I never said he wasn't a legend or deserving. It's just that a lot of older Oscar voters (remember the average age of Academy voters is way up there, particularly when this movie came out) don't generally take comic book movies that seriously. Him passing away definitely sparked more conversation about the film and likely got a lot of those older voters to actually pay attention to the performance.

And considering only like 7 or 8 actors in history have been nominated posthumously (most of whom put in performances in movies that came out long before most r/movies subscribers were alive), I don't think you're gonna find an example more recognizable than Heath Ledger. If you just mean an example of the Academy considering extraneous stuff, there's a million of those but very few where death was the extraneous factor.",miz3m9
gvyeh11,"This is why I don’t do Twitter lol. Thank god Anthony Hopkins doesn’t care. Hopefully most of the vitriol is directed at the Academy.
For the record I’m definitely not mad about being wrong in my prediction. Hopkins was INCREDIBLE. But to juggle the order of the awards in the expectation that you’re honouring a deceased colleague to close out your show? Biggest wet fart ending to an Oscars in history.",miz3m9
hdcadr4,"I was just telling some friends of mine how most films have been so disappointing. Hopkins was, man, other worldly in this. Tremendous.",miz3m9

gwmcx7u,"This is how I interpreted it as well.  The scenes with Anne's husband is actually James, and his frustration and possibly abuse (they also alluded to a drinking problem) led to their divorce.",miz3m9
gtl62hp,"Where is your proof the Oscars are in this ""current political climate"" lol. Chadwick also had a good performance, if he wins its not ""cause of politics""",miz3m9
gvakzvw,"There’s no guarantee anyone hit him. People with dementia often will remember things that actually happened from the past, but as the previous commenter said, sometimes they just make stuff up. My grandmother thought she was having an affair with her own son(my Dad), and nothing you did could convince her otherwise.",miz3m9
h424ib3,My guess that Hopkins ended up winning is because the average Oscar voter is an old ass white dude. Anthony Hopkins sliding into alzheimers/ ending up in a nursing home must have scared the ever loving shit out of those voters. They would have really felt that performance.,miz3m9
gvw3utm,He just lost.....,miz3m9
gvs693c,"Also his death, which isnt political. Chadwick winning this Oscar will have nothing at all to do with his race.",miz3m9
gvwyme3,"The thing is that Anthony's character does not *talk* about the abuse in the movie. It is not a story that he's telling people or is fixated on. He does not have to be convinced that it's not true because he himself does not ""believe"" it's true. Which is kind of the whole point: people can abuse dementia patients, justify it to themselves, and even get away with it, because they won't remember. From what I recall, the movie is already building up to that during the dinner loop scene, in which the husband is already taking advantage of the fact that Anthony doesn't remember things.

The movie is not *really* told from his point of view, which would be impossible anyway as the movie can't make you forget things. The movie is telling you his story (through a creative conceit), and his daughter's story, and the daughter's story involves a failed marriage due to being a caretaker, and we see enough of the husband outside of Anthony's POV to know how he feels. The abuse also makes the early scenes poignant, because Anthony makes fun of his daughter for not being in a relationship, and talks dismissively about her divorce, which we come to understand only happened because she was protecting him.",miz3m9
gvfz0l9,She probably did have an affair with someone else at some point and is mixing it up,miz3m9
hqmikot,Or it's because his performance was overall a better one than Chadwick's.  And saying that doesn't take anything away from him.,miz3m9
gvw422a,Lol I guilded you already haha don't rub it in 😂,miz3m9
i3g18dl,On point. I'm glad they gave the Oscar to the superior performance. Respect to all the nominees but hot damn this movie was a respectable nightmare.,miz3m9
gvgliqc,"I genuinely don’t believe that’s the case. Obviously anything’s possible, but my grandmother was my best friend. We literally talked about everything when I was growing up.  (I went to her for advice on boys, we talked about sex, we even talked about the kind of birth control she used that led to her having 3 kids in less than a year.)

I can’t put into words how unlike her that would be. Plus we live in a town of less than 600 people, where everyone knows everyone’s business. It would’ve been ridiculously difficult to do something like that and not get caught.",miz3m9
