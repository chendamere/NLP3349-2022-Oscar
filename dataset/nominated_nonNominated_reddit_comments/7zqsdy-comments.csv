duqkvni,I don't know if my comment posted but I was intrigued that the house the team stayed in within the Shimmer looked just like Portman's house. Also when Portman drinks water at the end two water circles are created out of the sip which is very interesting imagery. ,7zqsdy
dussk2c,"I went into my second viewing having absorbed the consensus theory online about how this was all about the characters' various forms of ""self-destruction"", but I came away this time with a pretty strong sense of what it was really about on a higher level. I think the self-destruction angle is definitely a theme, but it can't be everything because a) it's too on-the-nose since that concept was explicitly discussed in at least two different conversations between characters and this is definitely a movie that wants to be smarter than that, and b) it's a really sad and bleak message, and I actually think this is ultimately a hopeful, if somewhat solemn, movie. I'm curious to see what people think about my interpretation.

What I think this movie is about is: Personal change. It's like Lena says at the end-- the Shimmer wasn't destroying, it was changing, making ""something new"". I started thinking about this concept during my second viewing when I realized just how strongly the film seems to revolve around her relationship with Kane. It starts out with ""him"" returning to her, and it ends with the two of them together, with all those intervening flashbacks. Obviously this movie ultimately wants to be *about them* and perhaps say something about the nature of relationships. 

Before Kane goes into the Shimmer, their marriage is damaged-- she's having an affair and he knows about it. We see that they have a legitimate spark, but we know that something is broken. We see him distant, struggling with what to do. So he goes off on his quest of ""self-destruction"". But I think the Shimmer actually represents something more- a place people find themselves at times in their lives, a sort of mental purgatory where some kind of facing of fears and personal change is required in order to move on. Some kind of ""self-destruction"" might be a necessary part of that process, if one needs to shed parts of themselves that hold back progress. It also requires facing your anger and deepest anxieties. And like Josie says, some people when they encounter a stage of personal transformation, will be eager to face it, some will fight it, and some might just peacefully accept. 

So here's how I see the events of the movie from a totally metaphorical standpoint:
Kane goes off on his journey. He's so hurt, sad, and damaged that when he faces the possibility of drastically changing who he is, he yields to this impulse and allows the doppelganger to return in his place. He comes back to Lena but he's not the same man, and his new self is unstable, and too alien for her to accept. His transformation has threatened to be their final separation. Lena feels responsibility for what has happened, and is now given a choice, and posed to her by Ventress at the base: she could retreat and ""go home"", abandoning Kane and their relationship. But she has given up her affair and resolved that she ""want[s] to be with him"", which will require her own journey of self-appraisal, facing down of fears, and transformation. So she sets out on her personal struggle as well, to face her lies, anxieties, and yearnings. When her turn comes to face the new person that threatens to take over her identity, she cannot accept it as readily, and mostly preserves her current self. But having resolved her internal struggle and committed to enough of this journey of transformation, she returns to Kane and accepts him in his current state. They embrace, having a shared experience and newfound understanding. It doesn't matter who either of them once were or is now-- they have accepted and forgiven the past and will move forward together. 
 
People face all kinds of internal struggles and crises, and usually don't stay the way they were when we first met them. Staying committed to a relationship, or any endeavor in life, takes hard work, and asks that people take a hard look at themselves, decide which parts they can live with, and allow themselves to grow and change with each other. When times of struggle and transformation come, it's up to each individual how much to resist and struggle against change, and how much to accept it. Sometimes we don't have that much control over it. But at the end of the day, only through waging our own lonely internal battles can we understand and accept others as flawed and dynamic fellow human beings, and learn to move forward together, whether in a romantic relationship or otherwise.

I think ""annihilation"" here refers to the annihilation of the broken past, or parts of the self, that is sometimes needed to move on constructively.

durers4,"An interesting allusion I saw during the movie was immediately after they killed the freaky skeleton bear thing.

The physicist, reflecting on what just happened, talks about how ""it must be horrible to die scared and in pain and only having your screams of fear live on as the only remnant of you"" or something to that effect referring to how the voice of the woman who got dragged off by the bear still lived on in that bear. 

Later on, we see a scene where Lena is reading ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" next to Kane in a flashback. The book details the story of Henrietta Lacks, a woman who died from cancer in the middle 20th century but who had her cervical cancer cells taken during her treatment by a physician (without Lacks' consent or knowledge) for research purposes. Those cancer cells from Lacks live on today as the HeLa immortal cell line and have been used (and continue to be used) extensively as a study model for many important biological innovations (e.g. Salk tested his polio vaccine on these cells).

It seems like Garland is pointing to Lacks as a real life example of what happened to the woman who got killed by the bear; it would be terrible for you and your family to know that the only part of you physically living on is the mutated cancer cells that ultimately killed you. No matter how much good has and will be done with these cells, these cells that were once you and that ultimately unmade you will be the only vestiges that define your legacy.",7zqsdy

dv7rh5u,"The first shot of Lena cheating is a few second clip of her riding her colleague. When the movie cuts back to her, that's the moment she enters the shimmer.

At the military base, there is a cut back to Lena and Kane's home where Kane is leaving early. He brings her orange juice and sets it by the bedside table. This scene ends with Kane saying, ""I do love you Lena."" The cut back is of a cell dividing into two that Lena is looking at through a microscope. 

In the house in the shimmer where the team stays, which looks like Lena and Kane's home, Lena is looking at her own cells divide. Then a scene change to where Lena, having fucked her colleague, says that has to stop and she'll never do it again. The cut back to the house is ""You lying bitch!"" as Anya slams Lena's head with the butt of a rifle. There is a cut for a couple of seconds back to Kane and Lena's empty bed with the orange juice on the bedside on the table (so this is a reference to Kane's departure scene.) The cut back to the house has Ventress, Lena, and Josie tied up.

The final cut from the shimmer to Kane and Lena is immediately after we see ""The Lighthouse"" title screen. Kane and Lena are on the couch reading. They say ""Hey"" to each other. The body language, the way they say something as simple as ""Hey"" to each other - it's clear they're in love. They have something special. Cut back to the shimmer and Lena is doubled over crying.

There's been a few scattered comments that the affair wasn't needed to tell the story. The affair and the destruction it created? That is the story. Everything else in the movie is an exploration of that.

At its heart, Annihilation is a love story - though a tragic one. It's about love lost. Lena damages her own marriage (Ventress explicitly states how happy people do things like that, to make sure the audience gets the point) and then takes a journey to try and save it. It can't be saved though. The Kane she loved is gone.  

It has been really enjoyable reading redditors' interpretations of this film. Metaphysics, Jungian, fractals, self-destruction, depression, and more. These are amazing to read and give much to think about. Alex Garland - the director and screenwriter - was a literature writer before making movies. Like many writers, he's probably extremely well-read. The number of different influences people spot in this film are unlikely accidental. I'm going to guess Garland really, really knows his shit. This is a monumental work and, in my view, one of the most intelligent and greatest films ever created.

You know how sometimes you're talking about a great movie from decades past and think, ""It must have been insane to haves seen that in the theaters when it first came out. I wonder what that must have been like."" I suspect that 20-30 years from now, film fans will be saying that about Annihilation.",7zqsdy
dutezzs,"If you've ever suffered personal pain so intense that you've entered a period of self-destruction, you've entered the shimmer.

* Time gets distorted. If you've been in a dark place of depression or self-destruction, it's easy to lose days, weeks, or months.

* Communication to the outside world is cut off. If you've been in a hole, you know it's tough for others to reach you and you to reach out.

* Reality gets distorted. Events of the past and who you are get reflected in a way that is a mutation of reality. This could lead to seeing things horrifically but also can lead to seeing creative, beautiful things too - as Lena noted. (And why many artists have periods of self-destruction.) 

* There's a chance monsters (aka ""personal demons"") will tear you apart.

* Some who enter the shimmer don't want answers and they don't want out. The fight is gone. They just want to fade out and disappear, like the physicist who gently becomes part of the landscape. This is a moving portrayal of depression and would guess this part hits some people very, very hard.

For those in the shimmer fighting to find the truth - or ""the light"" - many will die before they get there. (The soldier's bones outside the lighthouse)

Kane does reach the lighthouse but he can't defeat the alien. Sometimes in life one reaches a situation so painful that one does not have the ability to handle it - something like a mental breakdown. At that point in life, who somebody is - their identity - incapable of handling the present situation has no choice but to blow themselves up. The Kane that survives the shimmer is a clone, he's not the Kane that went in. This could be seen as a metaphor for those who when entering a period of self-destruction get hammered and destroyed. They make it out, but the person who makes it out is not the same person who entered.

Lena reaches the lighthouse and the alien, her enemy, the one that blocks the door from her escaping, the one that mirrors and mimics her, she sees as herself. 

This is perhaps an inspirational message to those dealing with self-destructive issues. It's you who is blocking you and the only way you make it out of the shimmer is to blow that shit up.

Once she does that, the shimmer vanishes and Kane recovers. This may be a metaphor for somebody who successfully is able to defeat  their self-destructive tendencies. Things return to normal and those around them heal, even if nobody is quite the same as before they entered.

And for the shimmer appearing in their eyes. If you have been through a period of self-destruction, you can often see it in the eyes of others who have been there too. This may sound silly to some but those experiences really do change one's character. One can often pick out others who have been down a similar path.",7zqsdy

dur11w3,"The shimmer mimics and refracts what was there originally as well as what and who enters it. Every person that entered the shimmer was chosen or volunteered because really they had nothing to live for. Ventress says that people don't commit suicide, they self-destruct. So she sends purely self-destructive people into the shimmer which is I assume why the shimmer was growing. The shimmer didn't have a want or desire, it changed based on what went into it. The people going into the shimmer were destructive so the shimmer was destructive. Lena was the first to break that cycle because she had something to go back for. Her mirrored shimmer self didn't have a want, which is why she could destroy it without it fighting back. Kane didn't have a want to go back so he self-destructed and sent the new innocent shimmer version of himself back to Lena, the shimmer version doesn't know their past. While the real Lena does and will have to live with her decisions. The shimmer will continue to mimic and change and create based on what it encounters. The way I see it is that there is potential for it to create new good in the world if thats what its shown, but throughout the movie it is only shown bad. I see the ending as hopeful, that there is a chance of positive change, or just a lot more bad.",7zqsdy

duxcxe9,"**How The Area X Border Works - A Primer**

*SPOILERS FOR BOTH THE BOOKS AND FILM BELOW*

&nbsp;

I've noticed a lot of posts in this thread asking questions along the lines of:

&nbsp;

- Why not enter Area X by sea?
- Why not use aircraft?
- Why not use vehicles instead of walking? 
- Why not go in a few hundred yards past the border and then immediately come back out?

&nbsp;

These types of questions are all addressed in the books (which are excellent by the way... anyone who enjoyed the film should buy them). Given that Jeff Vandermeer gave Alex Garland input on the script, and that filming began two years after the trilogy was completed, I can only assume that a lot of this information was left out of the film for the sake of simplicity and/or keeping the runtime shorter. This is a shame though, because I think that an additional 30 seconds of exposition to flesh out the nature of the border/shimmer 
(perhaps during the scene when Lena first meets the other team members) might've helped some viewers enjoy the film more.  

&nbsp;

The film doesn't state it explicitly (although I suppose it's implied by the Southern Reach base location), but the only way into Area X is through a small entrance twenty feet high and twelve feet wide. As for the border's other characteristics, according to the books:



>[The border] had a door or passageway through it into Area X...



>[The border] did not allow half measures: Once you touched it, it pulled you in (or across?). It had discrete boundaries, including to about one mile out to sea. The military had put up floating berms and patrolled the area ceaselessly...



>The border extended about seventy miles inland from the lighthouse and approximately forty miles east and forty miles west along the coast. It ended just below the stratosphere and, underground, just above the asthenosphere... You could not get under the border by any means on the seaward side. You could not tunnel under it on the landward side. You could not penetrate it with advanced instrumentation or radar or sonar. From satellites peering down from above, you would see only wilderness in apparent real time, nothing out of the ordinary. Even though this was an optical lie.

&nbsp;

So, what happens if a person or aircraft or ship comes in contact with the border at some point other than its tiny entrance? Basically he/she/it vanishes/is obliterated:



>The night the border had come down, it had taken ships and planes and trucks with it, anything that happened to be on or approaching that imaginary but too-real line at the moment of its creation... The plaintive groan of metal and the vibration of engines that continued running as they disappeared into something, somewhere. A smoldering, apocalyptic vision, the con towers of a destroyer “sliding into nothing” as one observer put it… Some [of the sailors], though, just stood there, watching as their ship disintegrated, and then they crossed over or died or went somewhere else…

&nbsp;

As for why expeditions have to go in on foot rather than using Jeeps or ATVs: crossing through the entrance into Area X is far more treacherous and stressful than it appears from the outside. This is why the expedition members need to be hypnotized beforehand (the film gives a nod toward this when the characters suddenly ""wake up"" in Area X with no recollection of anything beyond approaching the border). It takes hours to traverse, and even though the entrance is twenty feet high and twelve feet wide, it becomes extremely narrow at certain points, making it impossible to get any sort of vehicles though:



>Even though it’s such a tall corridor and so wide, you have to crawl with your pack as close to the middle as possible. As far away from the sides as possible.” [said the scientist] Cheney... Like cats with duct tape on their backs, slinking forward on their bellies. “No matter how you feel about enclosed or open spaces, it’ll be strange in there, because you will feel simultaneously as if you are progressing across a wide open field and as if you’re on a narrow precipice without guardrails and could fall off at any moment. So you exist in a confined and limitless space all.



>Nor did the length of the passageway correspond to the width of the invisible border. Some reports indicated that the passageway meandered, while others described it as straight. The point was, it varied and the time to travel through it into Area X could not be estimated except within a rough parameter of a “norm” of three hours to ten hours.

&nbsp;

So it isn't quite as simple as stepping into Area X and then stepping back out again. And this assumes that the expedition members can even *find* their way out, as once inside Area X there is no longer a border. In the book the biologist comes across a written journal from a previous expedition that had traveled up the coastline in an unsuccessful attempt to reach the border from inside Area X:



>Instead, the same habitat confronted them day after day. “We’re heading north, I believe,” he wrote, “but even though we cover a good fifteen to twenty miles by nightfall, nothing has changed. It is all the same,” although he also was quite emphatic that he did not mean they were somehow “caught in a strange recurring loop.” Yet he knew that “by all rights, we should have encountered the border by now.”



>The return trip to the lighthouse took four days, not seven, “as if the land had contracted.”

&nbsp; 

In all I found the border to be one of the most fascinating parts of the Southern Reach trilogy. I wish it had gotten a bit more screen time in the film, but then the same could be said for a number of other aspects of the book (the writing on the walls, the Crawler, the hypnotic commands, etc...). That said, I was still blown away by the film and will buy it as soon as it becomes available for home viewing in the US.

dus4ve7,"MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW: Just my interpretation of the movie after a second viewing.

Just watched the movie a second time. I think I had a strange experience watching the film on both viewings. After my initial viewing, I understood the message of the movie and its themes about ""self destruction"". The idea of ""That which nourishes me also destroys me"". I understood that Lena and Kane both had to go through the destruction of the self to become anew. I didn't quite read what their hug at the end meant (let alone what happened in the lighthouse sequence). All I knew was that Kane was the alien and Lena was still herself. I was able to grasp how the psychologies of all the characters in the movie reflected their outcomes by the end of the film.

On my second viewing, I was absolutely blown away. I think I understand the larger picture Alex Garland was attempting to explain about the nature of our existence, life, and the idea of self destruction. I think there are a few key lines of dialogue that I think elevate the film towards ""the cosmic horror"" sense that is rooted in existentialism and the existence of higher dimensional beings/cosmic entities. These quotes aren't word for word, but just my recollection of it.

1. Lena in her classroom: ""All cells come from a singular organism from this planet, maybe the universe""

2. Lena and Kane in bed. ""God doesn't make mistakes"" - Kane
Lena then talks about the nature of senescence - how we think aging is natural but perhaps aging, death, and decay are actually a mutation on the cellular level that wasn't meant to be. I don't have the quote on this but this is what I read it as.

So from these two lines, I started viewing the film moreso among the lines of Alex Garland actually trying to explain the nature of our existence. Did we all truly derive from a singular organism?  Is the nature of the entity that Lena encounters in the tunnel of the lighthouse always to mutate and envelop the things that surround it? (Both living and nonliving - you can see plantlike structures/vines covered in the paint of the lighthouse, and also with the glass trees outside the lighthouse on the sand).

With the lighthouse sequence, when Lena first watches the video that was stored, we see the ""entity"" (The trippy psychedelic visuals at the bottom of the tunnel) and also ""the clone"" (By clone, I'm referring to the metallic body you see briefly in the cam footage looking through the tunnel, as well as the one Lena has an encounter with. These are both the same thing but different form). When we see Kane about to blow himself up, hes actually looking at someone behind the camera. On the first viewing, I took the dialogue as Kane speaking to the audience and super on the nose, but he is actually talking to the clone. He says:

 ""I thought I was Kane in this life. What was I before? Was I you? Were you me?""

He then asks: ""Have you ever seen a phosphorous grenade go off?"" It's pretty bright. Shield your eyes. If you make it out of here find Lena"" 

The clone(off camera): ""I will"" - Kane blows up and the alien/duplicate of Kane steps in front of the camera. Its clear to me on second viewing that Kane's motivation for going into the shimmer was because he felt like he wasn't enough for Lena. He felt he was the reason Lena was cheating on him. It's clear he still loves her, but he isn't enough for her (That's how I read his acting throughout the movie). When he looks into the entity, I think he has the vision about the nature of our existence and also comes to understanding that if he wants to be good enough for Lena, he has to destroy his old body. The clone in itself isn't malevolent - its just its nature. While we as humans may see the changes the entity is making as bad, its essentially merging all microscopic cells that it encounters. Its why we can hear Shephard's voice in the Skelebear, and why we see different species of flowers merging on the same plant structure. The nature of it being able to merge with other cells and organisms is very important and leads us to...

Lena proceeding to go into the tunnel where she finds Ventress. At that point, her and the singular entity have already merged. I honestly can't remember the exact dialogue but she says something along the lines of:

""We talked. Remember how I told you I wanted to find what's inside the lighthouse? I found it. Its inside me. Inside all of us. We will all be just fragments until we are one... ANNIHILATION"" - again not exactly but its what I can remember.

Lena then has the psychedelic vision, her blood gets enveloped in the entity, and it creates a ""blank canvas""/clone of her anatomical structure. She tries to shoot it, but its impervious to her bullets. It mirrors her, she tries to hit it and it hits back. She tries to run from it, but it prevents her. The clone sees itself and Lena very much as a part of each other, and doesn't want her to run away from it. She needs to go through the destruction of her self if she wants to move on from the guilt of her marriage and become anew (this seems like the primary motivation for Lena to enter the shimmer). 

The clone that formed from the entity views everything as part of itself. It wants to adapt and become better - but to become better you have to destroy your old self. When Lena touches its hand, it begins taking her appearance. She then puts the grenade in its hand. The clone is unaware of what this grenade is. That's why Lena pulls the pin, waits, and and is able to run out at the last second. The clone wasn't harmed by it - but the clone is still the entity. The nature of the entity is to mutate and evolve to its surroundings. Lena has left the lighthouse and the clone has returned to its metallic form. It is set afire in a blue plasma, and is looking for a form of life. It touches Kane's dead body - his body contains the physical form of ash. The clone then touches the vines that are in the lighthouse and they are cast afire. By touching Kane's ash body, the clone absorbed the physical reaction of something being burned to ash. It is set ablaze and dies in ash, and we see the glass trees surrounding the lighthouse light up and disintegrate into ash. Benedict Wong's character then clarifies in the interview room that a team has reached the lighthouse and it is all ash.

What I take from this, is that all life on Earth has derived from a singular organism. Maybe not the one that landed in the movie, but something similar that landed on Earth long ago. It begs the question - was the meteorite sent by some higher cosmic entity? Or is the entity itself just a higher life form/the original life form?

Now I can read the hug at the end between Kane and Lena two different ways.

1. Her hug was more just that she understands the clone is not malevolent. We are all apart of it and it is just trying to be itself.

2. Lena realizes that they are the only people to have entered the shimmer and return. They are both different on a cellular level. They are the evolved version of humanity. Does she realize they should still be together to reproduce and pass on these cellular mutations to another generation? Will them reproducing create a new life form on Earth? The film with this interpretation delves more into the importance of a man and woman in a relationship and that both are needed to reproduce (Like BR2049). 

These definitely aren't the only interpretations from the ending but I love the discourse about it from everyone.

I've rambled about the books elsewhere in this thread, and I don't mean to be that guy, but this movie is much more impressive in light of the books.  Book spoilers ahead (though hopefully nothing that would ruin the experience of reading them).

This is possibly the hardest book adaptation I can think of.  I remember coming away from reading Annihilation, and thinking that I would never see a screen adaptation.  The book is just too hard!  It reads like someone dared Jeff Vandermeer to write a horror novel set in the least threatening environment he can think of.  Not only is it set mostly during the day in a state park in sunny Florida, it seems like every character makes some kind of reference to how beautiful and peaceful the wilderness is.  The biologist is constantly talking about how the light bounces off the leaves, or how there's a clump of wildflowers in the distance, and the sun is shining, etc.

On top of that, the horror is Lovecraftian, which means that Jeff instills fear by describing how it make the characters feel in the first-person.  [Animals are portrayed as normal, but feel vaguely human to the characters - Jeff describes how it makes them feel unsettled.  Walking through the wilderness feels weird, but there's no outward signs of anything wrong.  Interpersonal relationships are warped and strained as time goes on, but the changes to the characters are told via their internal monologues.  Plants are clearly derived from human cells, but the biologist discovers that by looking at them in the microscope.](#spoiler)

There are some moments where the horror is shown, not just thought about from the perspective of one of the characters - there just aren't as many of them as you might expect.  [They see a video where the team members are conversing to each other in gibberish, but look like they understand each other.  Encountering the crawler in the tunnel/tower.](#spoiler)

I can't imagine how I would even begin adapting this.  [The part where the boar charges at them, and it's a totally normal-looking boar but feels disturbingly human - how do you ""show, not tell"" that?  I mean, Jeff writes it very well, but it boils down to ""it's normal but they think it's weird"".](#spoiler)  Then they creatively showed the link between the dead humans and animals by giving the bear the voice of the dead linguist.  Incredible creativity there.  In the book, the border is described as clear, showing the beauty of the consumed state park but being creepy at the same time.  They chose that bubble-wash effect to give an unsettling feeling without sacrificing light or color, which I would never have thought of myself.

The set design & screenwriting was just fantastic.  I can't imagine how I would preserve the tone of a book like that in a visual medium.  Great job to everyone involved.",7zqsdy

Was I the only one who felt bad for Kane as a character?

We're shown a history of he and his wife, met in the military, probably had some life-threatening and bonding situations during that time; he finds out she's cheating on him, he silently suffers, then decides that he wants to go on whats essentially a suicide mission because he's just done?

And then we're shown his final moments of life, where he's presumably spoken to not!Kane about his wife, how much he cares for her, and how he wants not!Kane to find her when he gets out, then commits suicide after spending months to a year in a specialized hell.

dur7ta2,"It’s just dawned on me that everyone that went into the Shimmer was knowingly going on a suicide mission, so everyone had something in common and were essentially damaged goods ... including Kane because he knew Lena was cheating on him. Everyone’s psychology was that of self destruction and the effect of the Shimmer exacerbated that to the point of suicide or madness induced murder.  The alien duplication was its evolutionary solution to this inevitable self destruction... make a copy before it dies.

Lena’s psychology was different ... she didn’t have a death wish and was driven by the opposite.. saving Kane’s life and in the process paying off the emotional debt she was in. Rather than wanting herself to die, or give in like the others ... she had the psychology to survive... there wasn’t a need for a duplicate and the alien seemed to almost accept the challenge to self destruct itself (the casual walking around the lighthouse whilst on fire, torching the walls was telling).

The scene at the end with Kane and Lena was amazing in all this context. Whether one was duplicate Kane and the other real Lena is irrelevant ... cells make perfect copies... the point was that Lena had atoned herself through this badass mission, and Kane has no knowledge of the affair... they can start again and make each other whole.

The Shimmer in their eyes at the end was a bit hokey but I get it...they are changed forever and have that alien dna within them...the story of psychology and redemption, personally, could have been grounded a little better by Garland throughout for an even bigger hard hitting emotional payoff at the end..which Arrival and Villeneuve nailed so well.

dutgb1r,"Deeply Jungian movie. The tripartite struggle with the shadow across three different individuals, Kane, Ventress, and Lena, is where the meat of this movie is.

[Kane is replaced by his shadow. Ventress succumbs to her shadow, and Lena integrates her shadow.](#spoiler)

In Jungian psychology, the ""shadow"", ""Id"", or ""shadow aspect/archetype"" may refer to (1) an unconscious aspect of the personality which the conscious ego does **not identify** in itself, or (2) the entirety of the unconscious, i.e., everything of which a person is not **fully conscious**. In short, the shadow is the ""dark side"".

Because one tends to **reject or remain ignorant** of the least desirable aspects of one's personality, the shadow is largely negative. There are, however, positive aspects which may also remain hidden in one's shadow (especially in people with low self-esteem, anxieties, and false beliefs).[1] To know oneself, one must **accept one's dark side.**

Contrary to a Freudian definition of shadow, therefore, the Jungian shadow can include everything outside the light of consciousness and may be positive or negative. ""Everyone carries a shadow,"" Jung wrote, ""and the less it is **embodied** in the individual's **conscious life**, the **blacker** and **denser** it is.""[2] It may be (in part) one's link to more **primitive animal instincts**,[3] which are **superseded** during **early childhood** by the **conscious mind**.

Carl Jung stated the shadow to be the unknown dark side of the personality.[4][5] According to Jung, the shadow, in being instinctive and irrational, is prone to psychological projection, in which a perceived personal inferiority is recognized as a perceived moral deficiency in someone else. Jung writes that if these projections **remain hidden**, ""The projection-making factor (the Shadow archetype) then has a free hand and can **realize its object**—if it has one—or bring about some other situation characteristic of its power.""[6] These projections **insulate and harm** individuals by acting as a constantly **thickening veil of illusion** between the ego and the real world.

[I emboldened certain text for emphasis. Kane's (also an allusion to the biblical Cain's) failure in his confrontation with the shadow is his lack of self awareness (also echoed in the bible story). In the movie, this manifests in his occupation as a soldier--purely body, taking orders--and his absence from all scenes involving the side conflict of Lena's affair. He's never depicted as finding out. He seems oblivious. So when his shadow manifests, and he does not see it coming, he loses himself and only his shadow remains. In the link at the bottom, this falls under the section ""Encounter With.""](#spoiler)

[Ventress' failure manifests in the opposite manner. She has no body--she has cancer--yet is fully aware of her own desire for self destruction, as is noted by her conversation with Lena during the Area X section. Her encounter with the shadow leads not to alienation and duplication, as with Lena and Kane, but to merging, to becoming. Ventress projects her desires onto the shadow. She says that she has come to understand that it does not want. It only annihilates. But as we come to see, the shadow simply imitates its subject. So the truth of Ventress' understanding is dubious; she confuses it with herself. She then gets what she wants, in horrifying, spectacular fashion. This falls under the section in the wikipedia link, ""Merger with""](#spoiler)

[Lena wins. She is a combination of both previous attempts, both soldier and thinker. I emboldened the part of text explaining that Jung's shadow is in everyone and the less it is embodied in conscious life, the blacker and denser it becomes. Lena takes his advice and literally dances with her shadow, or to use Jung's word, ""embodies it."" Imitation is the most basic form of learning. Lena starts as a child would, with her body through action and imitation, not rumination like Ventress. Lena's embodied confrontation and struggle with her shadow leads to a breakthrough in her awareness, just as a child's repeated action and imitation leads to higher-order cognition. This breakthrough leads her to formulate her scheme. Jung wrote, ""To know oneself, one must accept one's dark side."" So, Lena allows it to approach and joins hands with it, which is the moment the shadow becomes vulnerable, like her. She takes this opportunity to fully ""illuminate"" it, to reduce its ""blackness and density,"" with a phosphorous grenade. In the wikipedia article, this is in the ""Assimilation of"" section.](#spoiler)

[The true cleansing of the shadow leads to the destruction of that ""constantly thickening veil of illusion between the ego and the real world,"" i.e. the shimmer, since the shadow is the source of that veil, insofar as it remains un-articulated, un-confronted, un-accepted, and un-assimilated.](#spoiler)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_(psychology)


Edit: It's also worth noting that Jung dedicated an entire book, called The Red Book, to his experiments with psychedelics and the archetypal and religious experiences that they could induce. That this movie took on a cosmetically psychedelic varnish is no coincidence.

Edit 2: The topic of the Ouroboros has come up in places in this discussion thread and it turns out Jung also had his own thoughts on its significance.  It lends to the validity of this movie as inspired by a Jungian archetypal narrative on the encounter with the Shadow:

""The alchemists, who in their own way knew more about the nature of the individuation process than we moderns do, expressed this paradox through the symbol of the Ouroboros, the snake that eats its own tail. The Ouroboros has been said to have a meaning of infinity or wholeness. In the age-old image of the Ouroboros lies the thought of devouring oneself and turning oneself into a circulatory process, for it was clear to the more astute alchemists that the prima materia of the art was man himself. The Ouroboros is a **dramatic symbol** for the **integration** and **assimilation** of the opposite, i.e. of **the shadow**. This 'feed-back' process is at the same time a **symbol of immortality**, since it is said of the Ouroboros that he **slays himself** and **brings himself to life**, **fertilizes** himself and **gives birth** to himself. He symbolizes the One, who **proceeds from the clash of opposites**, and he therefore constitutes the secret of the prima materia which ... unquestionably stems from man's unconscious.""

Edit 3: Just a little extra thought on what exactly the alien is. So, if the movie, essentially, is the journey to an encounter with the shadow, then the alien is ""that which facilitates the encounter with the shadow."" In my first edit I wrote that the psychedelic aesthetic was just a cosmetic varnish, but that's wrong, now, I think. 

Sometimes what happens when people take psychedelics, is they have a ""bad trip."" Through some very interesting recorded experiences, it sounds like these bad trips are unexpected and unwanted encounters with, what's essentially the Jungian shadow, just induced chemically. I remember hearing that--I believe it was south american--shamans used strong doses of psychedelics for initiations, for the express purpose of adventuring out into the mental landscape, encountering ""something"" that, to paraphrase, would strip them down to their bones, and then reconstitute them anew, and equipped them with the ""wisdom of the gods."" ""Annihilation"" is a word that often comes up in these accounts. They would then return to their tribe with the wisdom they'd found on their trip. 

Anyways, it seems reasonable to interpret the alien as some sort of psychedelic, but that induces an actual experience, not a mental one (though users of psychedelics will often argue that their induced experiences are more ""actual"" than normal life). Funny enough, Johns Hopkins, the hospital sharing a name with the university in the movie, did some research on psychedelics and it's viability in curing nicotine addiction, with some outrageous success rate like 80% after six months. Don't quote me on that though.

Ah here it is...

dv5ocix,"I’m going to take a wild guess here and take this movie very literal. I feel like the shimmer was an airlock / science lab for the aliens. A place that mimicked their own environment to survive, while they tried to find a way to live in earths regular environment. All of the DNA changes and crossovers were experiments to see how to infiltrate their DNA into that of the earths creatures to see what works and what is most effective. 

When Kane (alien) comes home, he bleeds and gets sick, because he has yet to fully adapt to our environment. Water / air makes him sick. When Lena drinks the water, she looks for blood and sees none; the adaption is complete and they no longer needed the shimmer to survive.

duq0upx,"'I think the main thematic preoccupation probably belongs primarily to the film, which is really about self-destruction...It’s about the nature of self-destruction in a literal sense...But also psychological forms of self-destruction.' -Alex Garland, director [taken from https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/21/17029500/annihilation-ex-machina-director-alex-garland-sci-fi]

This movie is about our human nature, specifically, our self destructive nature that is 'coded within our DNA' as Dr.V mentions in the movie. 

We started out from a single cell, a singularly, and from there continued to evolve and change. The scientists (and Lena) go through this progression backwards: they walk into a world that is in constant evolution, and as Lena approaches the lighthouse everything begins to become one- the singularity. It’s almost like the history of the universe in reverse- but this singularity envelops humanity’s nature with it. And the nature it envelopes is our self destructive nature. Dr.V mentions that our self destructive nature is a part of our DNA, and we see how this nature manifests in Lena’s life through her history of cheating on her husband. But self-destructive tendencies are also seen in the fellow scientists lives- the physicist was known to use cutting as a way of experiencing feeling, Dr.V has a brash personality that makes it difficult for people to get along with her, etc.

As the scientists start to near the singularity they start to reflect their self destructive nature- threats to kill each other, the physicist (who we know has been having self destructive thoughts about herself) is willing to become plant-like, lose her original form, and therefore destroy her humanity. As they approach the lighthouse everything begins to become one. Lena starts to develop a tattoo that one of the other scientists has, the bear has echos of a human voice, plants can take the form of humans. Like the physicist mentions, their DNA is refracted onto different species. Everything that exists is becoming one thing the closer they get to the singularity. Everything started as one cell and evolved into something else. In the shimmer, everything begins at the evolution stage and becomes the one cell- but this one cell reflects the nature of everything that evolved before it. Most importantly, it reflects the human nature of self destruction: annihilation.

When Lena enters the lighthouse she sees her husband in the video, but this is (in my own interpretation) is actually the singularity that took his likeness and his self destructive nature- his willingness to kill himself shows this nature. The husband that is behind the camera is Kane's real self, but he has been constantly mutating like Lena explains earlier in the movie when she says her cells are constantly changing. When Lena finds Dr.V, Dr.V has given herself up to the singularity. Dr.V says one of the most important and poignant lines in the movie, in paraphrase: 'everything is headed towards annihilation'. Self-destruction is inherent in everything- in everything from human nature to cells. At the beginning of the movie, Lena mentions that she will be giving a lecture on autophagy, which is a mechanism cells use to break down its cellular contents into their basic macromolecular form.  Self-destruction is a part of our biology.

When Lena approaches the singularity, it took some of her blood, allowing it to take some of her likeness. Once it touches her later on it takes her form, including her human nature- self destruction, annihilation. The next part I’d have to watch again, I can’t tell if the singularity was trying to kill itself or have Lena kill herself. Regardless, the singularity lights on fire and again reflects humanity by destroying the lighthouse. Lena escapes but, like her husband, is changed by entering the shimmer. Her dividing cells were completely changing in likeness while she was in the shimmer, and even though she’s out she’s physically a very different person.

This movie has a lot of similarity to Apocalypse Now, where the deeper into the jungle or shimmer they travel, the more we see of humanities true form. In Apocalypse Now it was madness, in Annihilation it is self-destruction.

duqjudz,"I thought it was a stunning follow-up to *Ex Machina*, though I can see why the studio worried about its appeal.

I thought the cancer references were an interesting motif; the film is full of them. It opens with Lena giving a lecture on cancer cells. She is later seen reading *The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks*, which is about a woman who died of cancer and produced the first immortal line of human cells. Ventress is said to have cancer. Shepard's daughter died of leukemia. So many shots of cells dividing. I think the Shimmer's effects are a kind of cancer, in a way. It caused all of the normal cellular mechanisms to fall apart and bodies to grow in unregulated ways. That's exactly what a cancer does, too.

In some ways, the Shimmer appears to symbolize the reversal of evolution rather than evolution itself. Evolution has been a 4-billion-year process of differentiation. But inside the Shimmer, the characters and creatures steal different parts of each other and all begin to lose the features that make them unique individuals.

“Lena being an untrustworthy narrator/Lena is the clone”

While it is true that the story is told entirely in her perspective, if she is the clone, why would she lie and say the real Lena made it out? Why would the clone manipulate the audience? I think it’s very clear that the Alien/clone has no evil intent. The sole purpose and nature of it is to mutate things and make them become reborn in a sense. The Alien wasn’t able to comprehend what the grenade actually was or what it could do. I don’t think it would be able to manipulate the Southern Reach/the audience. 

I also think people are focusing too much on her eye having the same effect as Clone Kane. It’s not so much that because they have the same eye they’re both the clone, it’s that Lena is still a changed person after her journey into the shimmer either way. We’ve already seen her look at her own blood cells and she saw they were already mutating.

e2aye1g,"Just saw the movie and I really liked everything excluding the plot holes, many of which could be fixed by a few lines of exposition in the movie. Yeah yeah, I know the point of the movie wasn't to make perfect sense, but suspension of disbelief only works when it's supposed to be fantastical (DNA mixing and fractals), not when it's something that would have obviously been done by people in that situation or setting.


For example, not using a helicopter to quickly get to the lighthouse. Hahaha, ""Well everyone else we sent in never came back on foot or on boat, let's try more on-foot expeditions!"" As I stated earlier, a quick explanation as to why they couldn't do that would have fixed this issue.

Also, I'm wondering why the military there wouldn't already know about the mutations occurring. If they wanted, stick a few mice in cages tied to ropes right at the edge of the shimmer and allowing to it envelope them before pulling them out at different intervals would have quickly made clear to scientists there that something weird was going on with the mice cells. This could have been fixed by simply allowing the military to know at least this problem with the shimmer.

Has no one entered the shimmer, sat just outside of the perimeter for a few hours, and then walked out for testing? Having someone walk in with a camera, take some footage, and then walk back out within the day would have probably been a good idea as well.

***Why didn't they send people in by vehicle on the beach to reach the lighthouse within a day?*** Unfortunately this isn't easily explained away unless people begin to lose their minds as soon as the enter the shimmer. An older car running on combustion has no excuse to not work when entering the shimmer from what we heard in the movie so... Yeah that's a rather big plot hole that needed some explanation in the film. I can imagine some awful sea-monster prevented teams by boat from entering and returning, but again, explanations to tape over plot holes would have been nice.

Cool use of an unreliable narrator. Cool visuals. Cool alien life that works in a hard-to-fathom way. No real complaints for the concepts, though the woman who thought that the bear mutant ""absorbed"" the last thoughts of the first woman it killed was really stupid conjecture for a *scientist*, it was more likely just mimicry, which fits in well with the theme and plot of the film.

Obviously the main character is no longer herself because of various mutations due to the shimmer as shown by her eyes at the end, but uh... Why did the copy of Kane get better after the shimmer got cancer and uncontrollably multiplied the fire until it died? It would have made more sense for it to die instead of suddenly getting better, with the revelation that Kane wasn't really Kane made known to the scientist because of that. Or maybe it was really Kane and leaving the shimmer was killing him because he had been in it so long that he relied on it to live? That still wouldn't make much sense if both he and the main character survived without the shimmer around any longer.

I noticed that Natalie Portman's character had the tattoo that the man who had his stomach cut open on her arm at the end of the movie as well. I'm guessing that the ""refracting"" occurs with appearances as well, so I'm willing to let that go, because DNA transfer recreating a tattoo doesn't make any sense.

I also wish the psychologist acted like... Well... A psychologist and actually gave explanations as to what was going on in the minds of the other characters that was more than just, ""Our minds are breaking down like early onset dementia"". She should have been keeping track of the mental stability of everyone else but she instead was belligerent and strong-headed.

Unfortunately I haven't read the book, so it may have explained things better than the movie. I also would have changed the title of the movie to ""Apoptosis"" based on the way things were presented, because the physics explanation fell really flat, especially with how nonsensical the theories given by the physicist were. I personally wish Christopher Nolan directed this movie, he'd most likely do a wonderful job with it based on his previous work. His brother would have most likely been a better writer for the screenplay too.

The music was pretty good for the movie, don't have any complaints.

If giving it a score, I'd probably go for 6 or 7/10. Leaning more towards 6. Careful attention to patching potential plot holes while the movie was being written would have probably made them movie an 8 or 9/10 for me.",7zqsdy

If we follow the adage of ""I don't know"" (something the main characters say a lot, justifiably so) vs ""there's 2 theories, it's 1 of the 2"" (stated a few times), merge that with the whole cell division theme, we arrive at my conundrum.

Is there anything Natalie Portman says whilst being interviewed that could help us parse out whether she is still her or an alien. Because that's the 1 of 2 theories bit. You could chalk it up to idk because truly there is some part of her that was inside of that ""thing"". While the other part of me thinks she might mention something that couldn't have been fabricated by the alien, because the alien exhibited signs that it wanted to copy, not harm, when Portman went limp, it went limp, so it wouldn't necessarily lie to survive in a Darwinian sense.

Secondly, I thought it was amazing that Oscar Isaac had enough forethought to ""teach"" the thing that the white phosphorous is for holding and blowing yourself up. Without teaching it that, it never would've stood there and taken the hit when Natalie Portman gives it to it.

There are many parts of the novel that wouldn't have worked without explaining it more or having a sequel ie. the lighthouse keeper, the name Ghostbird. But there are also portions of the book I would have liked to see play a much bigger part. Namely the hypnosis by the psychologist and what the word "" Annihilation"" means in that context. That part specifically was one of the stand out moments in the book and I wish I got to see it on screen. That being said when I heard they were making a movie I didn't think it would work and they made it work.

e00r4td,The scene where Lena is underneath the lighthouse combined with the soundtrack is the best shit I’ve ever seen. ,7zqsdy
dwgl0vm,"So here’s my interpretation: The Shimmer is an allegory for grief, guilt, depression, anxiety.


The Shimmer and the journey within is an allegory for grief, depression, anxiety, or guilt. 

The women “enter” because they all suffer from something — cancer, the grief of a loss, addiction, self harm, guilt over sabotaging a happy marriage, etc.

Once inside this altered state — in which reality is still there but it’s experienced in a distorted, illogical, slightly off way — the way people suffering from emotional or psychological distress often feel — the women face a choice. Do they confront it? Overcome it? Succumb to it? Deny it’s existence?

Gina’s chacater denies it and simply tries to escape without confronting its reality. Sheppard is blindsided by it. Josie succumbs to it willingly. Ventress merely strives to understand it. Only Lena is determined to overcome it (i.e. overcome her guilt from cheating on her husband and driving him away). 

The will to resist and overcome is symbolized in the film by the delayed physical distortion of Ventress and Lena — their determination to confront the Lighthouse (or in the allegory, what’s ailing them) keeps their original selves in tact longer.

Lena literally confronts it — herself, literally getting in her own way — and finds a way to escape from this facsimile of her and destroys the shimmer (i.e. overcomes her emotional distress). 

However, although both she and Kane come through this traumatic emotional period (symbolized by The Shimmer) in tact, they are not the same people they were before entering it, just as anyone who overcomes a period of anxiety or depression is permanently altered by the experience. They are not the same person coming out the other side as they were when they went in. 

And though the Shimmer (acute period of depression or anxiety) is destroyed, they will always carry a little bit of it with them (the flicker of the Shimmer in their eyes and in Lena’s blood) — they’ve just learned to live with it and manage it.",7zqsdy

dvh23yd,"I gotta give this movie a 9/10.  Disclaimer:  I only go out to the movies, like, twice a year.

My only 2 gripes were:  First alien Kane suddenly gets better when the shimmer goes down.  I thought the shimmer, albeit growing, was a closed system.  This suggests that the shimmer has some effect outside of its zone of influence.  Second is basic dumb character moves like dropping your weapon to chase after your party member who just got yoinked into the shack.  The second gripe doesn't change the story but I like when details are paid attention to.

I read the wiki page and this paragraph stuck out:

>Due to a poorly received test screening, David Ellison, a financier at Paramount, became concerned that the film was ""too intellectual"" and ""too complicated"", and demanded changes to make it appeal to a wider audience, including making Portman's character more sympathetic and changing the ending. Producer Scott Rudin sided with Garland in his desire to not alter the film, defending the film and refusing to take notes. Rudin had final cut.[2]

So I'm thinking; who is this David Ellison guy that thinks this?

>David Ellison (born January 9, 1983) is an inbred mongoloid American film producer and the founder and CEO of Skydance Media. He was born into tons of money, and now uses it for gene therapy and making awful movies

No joke it's his wiki page.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ellison  Someone doesn't like him.

I'm glad Garland got his ending.  I would be disappointed in a lighthouse scene with a sentient alien monologuing about taking the world over and enslaving humanity with the protagonist heroically killing the alien then popping off a one liner or a pun.

i watched the movie a second time yesterday with my girlfriend, just to realise, i don't think its a great movie. now i think its a really great movie.

i really like about the movie, that it doesn't take your hand like most of hollyweirds productions these days. it's not shallow, or trivial. it has a deeper meaning and requiers a deeper understanding in some themes/metaphers. thanks for that!

i've read a few of the postings here, and really liked some of the ideas and interpretations, now i want to add some of mine:

do you guys know ""the power of 10""?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0

for me the movie mostly covers the overall theme of ""tumors"" in all its entirety. it addresses the ""cancer tumor"" inside our bodys, but also the human beeing as a ""tumor"", destroying itself - knowing or unconscious - but also its own habitat, but firstly the closest thing beside itself, its social environment (a love affair, the splitting of a couple, like a cell, just to combine itself again with something new, to ""infest"" something new, maybe to realise it doesn't fit...you can call it cheating ending up one way ;)). then ""it"" arrives, and is the next tumor, holding up a mirror to the human, as a nice metaphor of what the tumor we know is, just to show it's not ""evil"", it simply is.

now there are actually humans afflicted with tumors, which are tumors themselfs inside another tumor to investigate. that's exciting imho. :)

the movie also reminded my of ""stalker"" and ""solaris"" by tarkowsky in a good way, by keeping it original and give some unique ideas on its own. it resonates, which is always great.

it's so sad, that i wasn't be able to watch this at the cinema - even more sad, that americans were allowed to, but it ended in an boxoffice-disaster... the movie has good reviews, but nobody wants to see it/knows it. :/

what i just realized while watching it the second time:

the kane that kills itself isn't the original kane either, i think. he has an southern accent, the real one hasn't, so he's already a copy, the accent coming from imitating another crewmember/combining the two, or even someone from an older expidition maybe...

for me, the lena copy is an incarnation of her self-destroying self and as she realises, that she has to stop fighting herself to be free, the copy/mimic (still based/Created on her older self, still learning) knows, that it has no right to be anymore, also because there is probalby enough of ""it"" inside the lena leaving, but also inside the new kane outside the shimmer already... i also think, that ""it"" understands, that the ""new"" lena and the ""mimic kane"" are now a good fit, and on this planet, it will create something new through these two?! so the copy of lena inside the lighthouse destroys itself, because thats its programming as this version of lena (the circle closes ;)

the soundtrack is fantastic! the monologs and the images most of the time too and the cast is okay, imho.

the small details superb:
the glass/refraction scenes, with lena/kane only touching herself. that was fantastic.

and something important imho, regarding bad reviews and the bad boxoffice results: the movie assums more then a ""golfball sized understanding"" regarding most of its topics, some of them more complicated then watching a football game or the new thor movie ->

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2UHLMVr4vg

that sayed, i dont want to lift myself as something more intelligent, as a person, who gives the movie a thumbsdown or doesnt even want to watch it. its also interest and knowing some themes/metaphers. i am glad such movies exists. :)

e09bpk3,"The detail in this movie is amazing. How the glass trees where growing out of sand, because glass is made out of sand. And also the bones growing from the sand.

e0f6g22,"Just came in to say that.... well, I absolutely loved this movie.

Saddened by the fact that everyone sat on it, but overall impressed immensely by it.

First I should say that this is the closest to generating the 'feel' of the HP Lovecraft mythos that I've ever seen. Sure, there's a lot of 80s and 70s body horror movies, and of course Jacob's Ladder, but none of those movies really compare to the feeling of dread I got when watching this movie. The only other time I've felt that kind of dread was while reading At the Mountains of Madness, so take that as  you will.

I think the only wasted thread in the whole movie was the near-duplicate house within The Shimmer and the infidelity subplot. I think that these plot points could have been removed or tightened with additional dialogue. It didn't feel like they used those two things to their full potential.

I think people who watched it and expected it to be more lucid in terms of plot were missing the point. It was very dream like, and there are few other movies that I've seen that did that dream-like state so well. I felt like I was dreaming throughout most of The Shimmer scenes, and this I felt was done on purpose.

Overall I loved the movie. Definitely in the top 3 of my favorite movies of the year so far. ",7zqsdy
e19s7qk,"I watched the movie over the weekend and I have to say that I enjoyed watching it as well as reading all the related to it.

I definitely have to say that Scream Bear was one of the more unsettling monsters I have seen in a long time. One thing that stands out on the horror of the monster was its face. Because on the right side of the face, you have a human skull blended into it. Now if you look closer at it, it also has an eye, that is very human. In addition, the eye color is the same as Cass. I am not sure, but it does seem similar.

Also, if anyone has ever read the DnD Elder Evils, there is a creature called Ragnorra which is corrupting force that is like cancer reaches a world like a comet crashing into it.",7zqsdy

Why wasn't there a biologist in this science group before you know who shows up?

 And the first scene where they are attacked and Natalie goes all Rambo to save her comrade against what turned out to be a god damn [crocodile?   ](#spoiler) 
That scene could only work in a movie, since everyone came out amazingly ok, I mean everyone. 

Are we also going to forget that the one who goes crazy first is a [paramedic? They go through so much shit that I'm not convinced she would freak out like that, sorry movie you crazy.](#spoiler)

Also the various explanations in the movie, especially the Physical girls sounds like nonsense.

This movie seems to think its smart, but doesn't seem to show its smart. For me the main redeeming qualities are the thing that kills crazy girl ( I love its tactic), and the very last part when [Natalie sees the fractal creature and her low poly version](#spoiler) That made me like the movie a bit more. 

Also in the first scene we know [Natalie survives whatever happens](#spoiler) I did not like how this movie spoils that part even though yes we were expecting it to some degree.

Lena reads The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. That's your key. Cancer cells that became something more - a kind of immortality scientists still don't understand.

e1kddh6,"This movie is visually great, has a good soundtrack and you can't really complain about the photography and editing, but boy, was the screenplay a mess.

Sending in a small group of untrained scientists (and a paramedic) armed with assault rifles - with which they have brief experience, if any - and no support? Check. Making them walk through a forest, ""what are those strange things called helicopters and motorboats let them roam the forest of death and let's hope for the best""? Check. Sending in psychologically unstable people hoping they won't flunk the possibly existential-threat-level mission? Check. Not even a fucking exobiologist? Check (where is Dustin Hoffman when you need him). Not having tried before to send people in with a safety rope secured around every limb and many em-shielded cameras (which if I'm not mistaken are standard army equipment) independently secured? Check. Not having sent in a sizeable army of air-borne and ground-borne camera drones, with a pre-estabilished flight path when you figure out they lose signal? Check. Not having placed a transmitter-receiver with a shielded cable all the way from the inside to the outside of the shimmer border? Check. Not having dropped stinger missiles on the lighthouse just for good measure? Well, I would call this last one smart, if there was any hint that they were smart enough to *consider* the option.

And by the way, if you want to say that it's implied they tried all that but nothing worked, sorry but no. The outcome of any of these tests is non-trivial, we can't just infer how it would have gone to justify their failure, and I would say that after team over team of trained soldiers sent inside with no progress whatsoever, flinging in four academics and a health-worker is really not the best of moves.

And let's not even talk about the science. The *genes* are reflected inwards? Are you kidding me? That's like saying ""Oh yes, seems like the shimmer is reflecting the knots of our shoelaces, that's why we're experiencing vascular problems"". What? And mind, I'm not saying that it's impossible in a sci-fi context, I'm just saying no sane scientist who knew even remotely what they were talking about would ever propose that hypothesis without a vast, *vast* wealth of evidence, because it doesn't make any fucking sense given what we know reality.

The plants have human silhouettes and you think it's because they have *copied the human body-plans*?! That's not how this works. That's not how *any* of this works. If those plants had gotten our DNA inside them by some strange alien exofuckery, they would need to grow from a fetus-shape up, because our shape is an emergent property of our genes and first development. The plants in that scene made little sense, but what really made no sense was the biologist confirming it. What would've been way, *way* more reasonable would've been to suggest that those plants grew around human bodies like a [strangler fig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangler_fig) and then the bodies decayed away. That a plant would incorporate our DNA and then end up like a normal tree with a human profile makes absolutely no sense.

The bear thing? Please. A strange rotten bear copies the dying scream of your teammate and the first thing you can think about is that it absorbed her DNA, **and therefore her mind?!** THAT'S utter bullshit. What about parrots? What about blackbirds? Was [aggressive mimicry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggressive_mimicry) too mundane for the *biologist* to consider?

And the ending. God the ending.

Good use of an unreliable narrator, I'll grant the direct that, but the glowing irises at the end were the most heavy-handedly shoehorned exposition I've seen in a long time.

Overall, I can't believe they had the doubt that their movie would end up being [too intelligent](https://www.imdb.com/news/ni61802450) for their audience. Wow, good thing they managed to dodge that bullet.

While a lot of the events in the film did not stem from the novel, it completely captured the essence of it. The mystery and dread. The curiosity and terror. I loved what they did with the idea and how they made something new with it. Honestly, it would have been incredibly difficult to stick closely to the original story, so I think they did exceptionally well.

This is a slow one, for those who don't have patience, and I see s lot of complaints about the ambiguity of the ending. I, personally, got it, and felt it brought everything home.

Where the movie succeeds, despite some problems in the scenario, is at delivering a fun adventurous story. The bear scene is absolutely amazing and on its own makes the movie worth watching. That freaking bear was insanely f****ing terrifying, one of the best movie monsters ever, on par with the Xenomorph and the Pale man from Pan's Labyrinth.

Honestly, if only the movie had worked on fixing its very numerous plot holes, it could have been an absolute classic. But there's just a little too many. Why is the government/army taking the potential end of the world so lightly? Why are they sending people all the way to the lighthouse rather than simply in-and-out to prove it's possible to get out? Hell, send in a dog with a long leash and a gopro, and then pull it back!

Why are there crystal trees, when crystal is not alive? Scrambling radio signals and DNA are nothing alike, it doesn't make sense to explain them as identical processes. Why are the characters generally so careless about their surroundings, when clearly there are very dangerous creature roaming around? Why would the army send an entire team of psychological fuck-ups led by a clearly mentally unstable psychologist,is there really nobody else who is better qualified? How did Kane escape the zone unseen? Have no animals escaped the zone (birds), and why not? Why go the long and difficult way instead of by sea or along the coast? How could the government, any government, keep something this big a secret (this is not some underground base, it is very visible from a very long distance, probably hundreds of km on a clear day)? Obviously, this is how hollywood works now - coherent stories are not a requirement; but it's a pity.

dxa9iv7,"I liked it a lot, but not as much as Ex Machina, Arrival, and Under the Skin which are the closest comparisons to me. 

I've read a few of the questions and concerns people here have with it, but I mostly disagree with their conclusions. 

It's not perfect, but I think the ""logic"" works on a few levels. 

First, this is an alien dimension that has opened up on Earth. By the nature of it being alien, we can't understand it. The way we perceive it may only be superficial, while what's really happening is far more complex. It's like asking what's beyond the border of our universe, and even real science is making wild guesses at that point. To this end, I appreciate the use of light a-la Kubrick in 2001 (and in a zillion art movies since) to represent realities we can't even imagine. 

Second, I think it's fair to compare it to a dream, or drug induced hallucination, like in many horror movies. In this sense, things don't have to make any more sense than they do in dreams. Was it as convincingly dreamlike as anything by David Lynch? Not in my books. But I still found it compelling. For example, would plants ""technically"" grow in the shape of humans? Well, I can definitely imagine seeing something like that in a dream, or hallucinating and staring at a tree and free-associating it with the human form. 

It wasn't as focused as I would have liked. But I think it still carried a strong and interesting message. The principle theme in my reading is entropy, much like in a lot of other classic sci-fi. It seems like entropy is intrinsic to our ego and ability to consciously perceive the world around us. We think about entropy, therefore we are, or something. Annihilation felt like a powerful meditation on ego death. It presented a tangible form of the inevitable point at which our consciousness will eventually disappear and our essence will once again be joined seamlessly with all other matter around us. At the same time, it affirmed the need to hold on to what makes us human for as long as we can, until the bitter end, because humanity remains a unique singularity in all of the cosmos. 

Shit, just writing this I realized how good that show was, and now I'm looking forward to seeing it again.

duq113f,"Warning, spoilers for movie and book.

I really enjoyed the movie as a whole. I loved that Garland stuck to the theme and vibe from the books while making quite a different narrative. There were still a few things I didn't like though. I really wasn't a fan of moving the Biologists motivations from her genuine curiosity about area X to her finding out for her husband/redeeming herself in the eyes of her husband.

The psychologist as a character was kind of butchered. Jennifer Jason Leigh killed the psycholgist's mannerisms and tone but they shrugged off her motivations to going into area x down to having cancer and that there wasn't much time to find out what was going on. They also decided to just look past the psychologist hypnotizing them for days, while they hint at it, they never touch on it again for the remainder of the film. Her manipulative nature is still obviously there it just wasn't expanded on which was strange to me.

The exposition of the film felt very rushed to me as well, I don't think it gave very good background to Portman's character and her instantaneous motivation to go into area X.

Also didn't like the fact that they killed off everything in area X, maybe they felt like they had to do that in order to get Portman back to Southern Reach? Either way I wish that didn't have to happen since it gives finality to area X, removing the idea of it being threatening and encroaching.

I was really looking forward to the tower and everything about it. Especially the writing on the walls, the creature, the glow (which we get to some extent), ""ANNIHILATION"", etc. Another thing I really liked from the book was the man vs man that we got there but was fairly absent outside of the one woman tying them up.

Visually the movie is stunning. The lighting and use of color is awesome. But I think that lends itself to giving it less of a foreboding, threatening atmosphere and more of a mystical one.

I guess my biggest complaint would be that there wasn't too much respect given to the mystery, or Lovecraftian nature of area X. If something happened you were explained EXACTLY what it was. E.g. It was Aliens, that was her voice in the monster, that's not the real Oscar Isaac. I think that part of that problem is due to the nature of film making it too difficult to show the subtlety and the unreliable, but I would have really appreciated if we got less ""Look how many fucking faces are on this bear"" and more of a dolphin in the background with a human-like eye, or a direct comparison where the biologist says ""they looked almost human"" (definitely not an accurate quote) in reference to the plant people instead they have the characters instantly understanding their genetic makeup. All around frustrating in this aspect that Garland felt some necessity to shove all answers into the viewers face when he is fully capable of being more ambiguous.

This post has far too much complaining and nitpicking that isn't reflective on the movie which again, I really did enjoy especially the lighting/setting. The films good on its own merits but has some issues, as long as you didn't go in expecting it to be like the book it's still quite enjoyable.",7zqsdy

dzoo66z,"So I'm probably too late to this conversation. This is for anyone who reads it because i think many people got the point of the movie very wrong. To start, the ""living"" ""organism"" that was on the meteorite which hit the Earth, was just a ""something"" that was trying to survive as we do. Its way to do so, was through adaptation, assimilation, adjustment and naturalization to everything it came in contact with and our nature, animals, human mind was just a source to do so - to become an actual being. It tried to reflect us and everything around us until it would find proper form to finally show itself. This ""it"" is basically a perfection, you see, the best way to survive is to adapt to surrounding conditions. For us humans it was the Earth and society structuring, but for this ""it"", it is actually everything, every contact element. It will just adapt to it. In terms of evolution, we could speak about perfection. It has no intelligence, no natural consciousness it has nothing! Only a ability to adapt to everything, and perception (vision) to survive as a species. That's why all the mutations - attemtps. Let's move on. Theoretically, this ""it"" targeted Earth knowingly and on purpose. It might expect that if there is some (for them) intelligent extraterrestrial life here on the Earth, it would approach them and tried to communicate. Perfect strategy. Obviously it were firstly animals then us. It was its own intention all the time. To decoy a prey, basically. This shimmer field was an area of its effect - reflection, adaptation. It was an intention. Let's move on again. When human entered, it immediately knew about us as a species - our genes, brains, dna structure, rna, evolution progress, chromosones, counsious experience etc.. When her husband (forgot his name lol) as leader of a group and as a husband (evolutionary speaking alpha male) (that was the reason he survived) came purposely to the lighthouse, the 'it' injected itself to him - making him a host and its new form as it could finally reproduct. Although it was in him all the time anyway as proccess to be sure every element is infected. But it was missing something, the tool to reproduct. Female. That's why it chose him as a host, because it knew he is fitting the most to its intentions - thanks to its reflection ability in the shimmer. So, naturally as the movie goes we can see her, obviously, approaching the lighthouse same way as her husband. Needs to say that the psychologists was a medium for entering human mind because psychologists know most about human mind, so this was a very smart move. To be honest I'm not 100% why did the form appeared at all. We can see it gimmick her, basically tries to adapt to well ready form. It injected itself to her again and burned all the evidence because the job was already done. Everything was ready and how it was supposed to be. Perfection. Nothing left. Only two genes ready to mate each other ;). That's it. The perfect plan as how you would expect from a perfection itself. Basically the movies goes on about and points out very probable possibility of an extraterrestrial life form. ",7zqsdy

duy7hj5,"Watched this movie recently, and liked it well enough. Seemed like a story about how we all imprint on each other, and struggle with our own inner demons before setting out on the path to who we will eventually be -- sometimes setting fire to the person we once were as the strongest emotions in us push us forward.

I'm not going to go into a long-winded explanation of the entire story, but here are some interesting examples from the film to help support this theory:

1. Kane, who we hear from Lena knows about the affair, is battling internally with that fact. As Cass says, everyone going into the Shimmer knows that no one has returned yet except for 1 person.. Why would they go in if they were happy with their lives? This can be debated because it could be a required mission for Kane, but I choose to believe that Kane thinks his marriage with Lena is over and thus accepts the mission and even leaves a day early. Kane presented himself as religious early in the film, and decides to literally bath himself in the light of the phosphorus grenade, cleansing himself of his internal struggle -- leaving his less-burdened shimmer clone to go forward and continue his life and be with his wife. A question here might be, who is this new Kane, and even if he is lucid, does he have the same memories/mannerisms.. what is he? Hints of an answer to this can be seen in the alligator-shark, the man-bear, and the deer-with-flower-antlers continuing to do what they would normally do in the wild.

2. Lena's struggles are from a disconnect from her husband whose presence in her life left her wanting -- both physically (his months-long missions) and intellectually (his reading a magazine vs her reading a scientific book), leading to her to choose to have an affair with a colleague. Another possible struggle is her being an atheist/agnostic as evidenced from her sarcastic conversation with Kane while in bed. These struggles bring up questions of identity, and of will. Lena moved away from the military to pursue academics for some reason -- maybe not being fulfilled with where she was and desiring some deeper understanding of life, rather than wanting to continue to be a part of something larger than herself. Or maybe she merely wanted to dive into medicine to change the way she fit into the world? I feel like the Shimmer offers you a choice.. you can let go mentally and give in to the randomness of nature, allowing your body and mind to be destroyed, or you can fight to stay whole, and possibly continue your existence, or whatever is left of it after going through the prism. Lena stayed sane somehow all the way to the lighthouse. She struggled and failed multiple times with her shimmer clone, but eventually found a way out, but not before being changed by it. She also defeated the clone by causing it to internalize the phosphorous grenade's properties and spread that to all the other connected shimmer creations. Does that mean there were only 2 actual shimmer entities? I presume not, and each shimmer clone was a mixed-copy. Also, why didn't the shimmer clone copy Lena when it was pressed up against her? Was it because she was rejecting it mentally instead of facing it directly?

3. Dr. Ventress was most likely rejected because she had cancer, but it also seemed like she had lost the will to live -- her entire scene down under was the shimmer clone being absorbed by her, but then ultimately scattering her cells. I feel like it's safe to assume this is because she wasn't a suitable host. Had she lost the will to live because of her cancer alone, or had her continuing to send healthy people into the shimmer weighed down on her? 

4. The theme that negative thoughts are a cancer that rots us from the inside out was really interesting. Kind of jives with this idea that I've been thinking recently that, no matter what we devote ourselves to, it will not only take time to make something of that thing.. it'll also take a little bit of who we are. That little bit of us that we trade is sometimes worth it, and sometimes not, but in the end, we always end up different. How we allow ourselves to react to external and internal stressors is the exact same, and can mean the difference between self-destructing or becoming stronger in some way -- it's all a decision.

5. That ourbouros/infinity symbol looked like a tattoo that at least one person had who had entered the shimmer -- eventually, it looks like everyone gets it on their arm. Lena doesn't have it until the rowing scene (after the alligator attack), and I definitely see Cass, Kane, and Snakes-fer-guts dude with it. The way I saw it, it appeared to represent the perpetuity of life and how cells don't just die and disappear, they're recycled or re-purposed in some way. ",7zqsdy

dvyoxui,"I like to ponder an alternative idea to a sentient alien - that the thing was not a sentient anything, but instead a purely physical phenomenon. The movie does not really contradict this idea. 

Imagine a planet that has never known fire, and one day something burning falls from the sky. Everything it touches, starts to smolder, cook and burn, and the fire spreads. For the inhabitants, it can seem like somebody willfully malevolent has appeared, an alien that attacks in some weird way, that transforms their home and themselves in incomprehensible ways into something twisted and wrong, for some nefarious purpose. But it's just a simple physical phenomenon with no awareness or will. 

Sure, that thing in Annihilation was way beyond what fire is, but - it could have been just a mind-boggling physical phenomenon. Just something completely outside of our understandable context - like something three-dimensional rolling over Flatland. 

So the humans rather naturally think that an alien has landed, but instead a weird piece of physics has landed. In and near the phenomenon things change and refract in impossible ways, but the only agency there is within the sentient beings themselves. Lena gets refracted into a copy, human-like but not human, containing both humanity and strange physics. And the sentient copy wants what Lena wants - wants to end the phenomenon - and has sufficient understanding to know how to stop it. Like the process of fire can easily be stopped if you do it right, but rage out of control if you do it wrong. 

The non-sentient phenomenon idea brings to mind Strugatskys' *Roadside Picnic*. They had an actual alien visitation that left weird zones on Earth, where the laws of physics behaved in weird ways, and it was full of completely inexplicable items and processes. And perhaps its most inexplicable aspect was its effect on humans, which, again, had no comprehensible cause or mechanism. But people frequenting the zones underwent weird changes. And even though their DNA had not  perceptibly changed, their children were mutated into something very different. 

The parallels between *Annihilation* and *Roadside Picnic* are many, but one thing that stands out especially is that in both worlds, the humans were utterly helpless, utterly unable to comprehend. The scientists investigating the zones were as frustrated as the ones in Annihilation - nothing made sense. At least in the zones, they found artifacts they could make practical use of, like infinite energy batteries. The Shimmer gave scientists nothing. ",7zqsdy
dvz5s8z,"This movie might be the best Cosmic Horror I've seen. It's about so much, thematically. Self destruction, Cancer, Infidelity, concepts of God (and what an all powerful, deistic creator could be), coming through trauma - there are so many ways to take it. And it paints such an incredible hallucinogenic world - honestly this film is like a psychedelic experience, even in the way the story mirrors the deep introspection and internal confrontation that they can cause: the idea of losing yourself, ego death. For me, being inside the Shimmer would be more frightening because of what it does to your mind, it is like a powerful acid trip, time dilation, loss of self, inability to think straight - it would be hell if you were stuck like that for a long period of time, and the mental effects show in all the characters... Trying to truly empathise with that situation is easier if you have had a psychedelic experience, but it's not essential to it, as long as you can put yourself in their shoes the film becomes even more powerful. How many of us can truly say we'd make it to the lighthouse if we were presented with the discoveries and challenges the characters face. Also, the idea that somehow everything is drawn towards this epicentre, the singularity. The orb being in the lighthouse, almost god-like in its depiction, but also completely amoral, more like an event happening that a driven agent. 
This film isn't one you need to unpack and understand straight after watching it. Just experience it is my advice. 

These are just first thoughts - this film DEFINITELY bears repeat viewings. All the people saying ""this film is just pretending to be highbrow"" - eh, you can dislike a film without discrediting it's intentions, this film is clearly playing with intelligent philosophical ideas and knows what it is doing. It doesn't need to tie up all the loose ends, it's good to be left with more questions than answers. I think its implicit that we could never hope to really fathom what the Shimmer is, so what's the point trying to cram an answer where none could possibly exist that we would understand.

I won't suck the dick of this movie too much, but I've never seen anything like it. There are movies that share themes with it sure, but it's really out there on a limb of Sci-fi. I genuinely prefer it to Ex Machina, as brilliant as that was.",7zqsdy

Then Lena comes in with the others and it mirrored their self-destructive tendencies. Lena is able to take advantage of this and makes her own double kill itself. So Kane and Lena had to kill off their doubles (""real"" and shimmer duplicate) in order for them to be able to leave.

Now here's why I believe her double then sets fire to the rest of the Shimmer, it realized that Kane's double and real (but changed) Lena are actually now a good match/duplicate of each other and could maybe create some kind of evolved shimmer baby together!?

dutyfbr,"I went into my second viewing having absorbed the consensus theory online about how this was all about the characters' various forms of ""self-destruction"", but I came away this time with a pretty strong sense of what it was really about on a higher level. I think the self-destruction angle is definitely a theme, but it can't be everything because a) it's too on-the-nose since that concept was explicitly discussed in at least two different conversations between characters and this is definitely a movie that wants to be smarter than that, and b) it's a really sad and bleak message, and I actually think this is ultimately a hopeful, if somewhat solemn, movie. I'm curious to see what people think about my interpretation.

What I think this movie is about is: Personal change. It's like Lena says at the end-- the Shimmer wasn't destroying, it was changing, making ""something new"". I started thinking about this concept during my second viewing when I realized just how strongly the film seems to revolve around her relationship with Kane. It starts out with ""him"" returning to her, and it ends with the two of them together, with all those intervening flashbacks. Obviously this movie ultimately wants to be about them and perhaps say something about the nature of relationships.

Before Kane goes into the Shimmer, their marriage is damaged-- she's having an affair and he knows about it. We see that they have a legitimate spark, but we know that something is broken. We see him distant, struggling with what to do. So he goes off on his quest of ""self-destruction"". But I think the Shimmer actually represents something more- a place people find themselves at times in their lives, a sort of mental purgatory where some kind of facing of fears and personal change is required in order to move on. Maybe you're depressed, maybe you have a big choice to make, maybe you're just trying to get from A to B. Some kind of ""self-destruction"" might be a necessary part of that process, if one needs to shed parts of themselves that hold back progress. It also requires facing your anger and deepest anxieties. And like Josie says, some people when they encounter a stage of personal transformation, will be eager to face it, some will fight it, and some might just peacefully accept.

So here's how I see the events of the movie from a totally metaphorical standpoint: Kane goes off on his journey. He's so hurt, sad, and damaged that when he faces the possibility of drastically changing who he is, he yields to this impulse and allows the doppelganger to return in his place. He comes back to Lena but he's not the same man, and his new self is unstable, and too alien for her to accept. His transformation has threatened to be their final separation. Lena feels responsibility for what has happened, and is now given a choice, and posed to her by Ventress at the base: she could retreat and ""go home"", abandoning Kane and their relationship. But she has given up her affair and resolved that she ""want[s] to be with him"", which will require her own journey of self-appraisal, facing down of fears, and transformation. So she sets out on her personal struggle as well, to face her lies, anxieties, and yearnings. When her turn comes to face the new person that threatens to take over her identity, she cannot accept it as readily, and mostly preserves her current self. But having resolved her internal struggle and committed to enough of this journey of transformation, she returns to Kane and accepts him in his current state. They embrace, having a shared experience and newfound understanding. It doesn't matter who either of them once were or is now-- they have accepted and forgiven the past and will move forward together.

People face all kinds of internal struggles and crises, and usually don't stay the way they were when we first met them. Staying committed to a relationship, or any endeavor in life, takes hard work, and asks that people take a hard look at themselves, decide which parts they can live with, and allow themselves to grow and change with each other. When times of struggle and transformation come, it's up to each individual how much to resist and struggle against change, and how much to accept it. Sometimes we don't have that much control over it. But at the end of the day, only through waging our own lonely internal battles can we understand and accept others as flawed and dynamic fellow human beings, and learn to move forward together, whether in a romantic relationship or otherwise.

I just can’t get over the fact the house they stayed in over night resembles Lina’s Home! It’s like they mimicked their thoughts. Lina even stands at the bottom of the stairs and almost reflects. It’s exactly the same as when Kane enters their house after turning up out of the blue. He stops at the bottom of the stairs. 

The large question is why destroy yourself if the Lina at the end is a dupe? Why destroy all the creatures/flowers around you that the alien mutation created? It’s clear Kane is definitely a clone, we see that from the video but I don’t believe Lina is. I think she has mutated like everything else, she’s the one that touches the others that died, that would prove the tattoo part. She doesn’t touch the girl who wonders off and the girl with cancer so she wouldn’t have their personality or something about them. 

I think they will go on to mutate and develop more alien like creatures. Almost like Adam and Eve off the alien world. ",7zqsdy

e0f3ik2,"This movie was absolutely nothing like the book.

With that said, it still captured the fear, trauma, and urgency that the book had. I think the two told the same story (although, believe it or not, the movie was more explicit in wtf was going on), just from two very different perspectives. I honestly wasn’t expecting a “horror” movie, but the score definitely further elevated the suspense that the cinematography created. There are aspects of the book I really wanted to see come to life, but the new things (and the twists on the old) still made this really, really good to watch.

It was really great seeing a predominantly female cast, especially, be given something so challenging and not at all steeped in cliché. Natalie Portman was great, although I kept getting flashes of her character in V for Vendetta. 

I think despite the film being “weird”, the plot was pretty straight-forward. So often we create these alien characters that have a “why” for being on Earth and wrecking the havoc they do—these species had no such humanistic urging (or failing)—except what was impressed upon it. Ultimately I think it sought out the most symbiotic attainment a planet could have—as removed from emotion as that endeavor is. I know the cancer analogy was the one used, but I don’t know if it’s the most fitting for this thing. When I think of cancer I think of destruction and ultimately death, and if this thing “killed” anything it was a means to an end. To create something rooted fully in a paradise-like harmony.",7zqsdy

dv41sck,"Wow is all I can say. While I did think certain lines were cheesy (like the explanation of the shimmer refraction thing), the sound design and the visuals made up for it. I loved that little synth warble in the trailer and was on the edge of my seat waiting for it to come up. When it did, holy shit. My stomach dropped and chills ran down my spine. Also the part after the lighthouse scene with the deafening audio, I actually felt like my soul was leaving my body. I wanted it to stop but also just keep listening to it forever at the same time.

There wasn't that many people in the theatre when I went, so I found myself alone in the auditorium during the credits. Watching the psychedelic visuals on screen and the haunting audio in the background (coupled with my own isolation), I began to feel a feeling of dread, of the Shimmer, as if I would turn around and the metal alien clone would be sitting in the seat behind me. I packed up my stuff quickly and got tf out of there, but I won't forget that feeling. Ever.

I enjoyed this movie so much because it reminded me of another sci-fi favorite, Arrival (which i love to pieces). Any other movies similar to these two?

dv4kydy,"Maybe this is taken as given, but does injury exacerbate change? I figured Tessa Thompson's character returned to self-harming which is what caused her to start growing leaves (before she ""accepted it"") and the stunning transformation of the guy in the pool wall may be because they cut a giant section of his body open. 

A biological reasoning could be how the body normally replaces its cells slowly, but replaces cells much more quickly when it's repairing an injury. Instead of repairing itself with normal cells, though, it's repairing itself with shimmer cells.

dvq0hxf,"My take on it is that the ""alien"" isn't a sentient being at all. Whenever we imagine extraterrestrial life, we give it organism-like attributes, but I think the key to understanding the nature of the shimmer is Lena's lecture to her students at the start of the film. All life on earth originated from a single cell that replicates, and on another planet, it's likely that this mathematical replication would be identical but the data it replicates variable. The nature of the ""alien"" is the replication process itself: less a being than a virus or a cancer, a verb instead of a noun.

If we accept that the ""alien"" is centred at the lighthouse and refracting the data around it, the closer to this prism one approaches, the more extreme the refraction. And the nature of this refraction is the merging of everything the field touches. Like light through a prism, however, the merging does not necessarily occur with things that are physically adjacent to one another: it occurs with things that are aligned to the angle at which the prism/lighthouse/centre refracts. Farther from the prism, the bending/refraction is more acute—e.g. the merging of the crocodile and shark teeth, or a human and bear scream. Closer, it becomes more obtuse, which allows more disparate elements to merge, like humans and plants or the enormous crystalline trees near the lighthouse. Ultimately, when Ventress sits in the centre of the prism, her body is refracting and merging with itself, which causes her to be annihilated.

Now, if we accept that the merging of all complex forms within the shimmer are due to refraction, what about the doubles of Lena, Kane, and the stag? These are a result of the alien's virus-like nature to replicate data. (My interpretation is that this process requires a close proximity to the ""alien"", while its field of refraction is immensely larger. This explains why the only creatures in the shimmer who were replicated were those who entered the lighthouse, plus the stag who conceivably could have lingered in its direct vicinity. What we don't know is whether the replication would have continued in a binary 2^x series had the characters remained in the lighthouse for longer.) At any rate, these replications appear to be true clones, with the original's exact DNA, physical body, behaviour, and memories. Very possibly they may have a consciousness, but of course there is no way to know. This to me is the poignancy of the ending: the clone of Kane has all his memories and knows exactly who Lena is and all about his past with her, but this is only the second time his consciousness is experiencing her.

A lot of people in this thread have been suggesting that the clone of Lena in the lighthouse is the manifestation of the alien's being, which learns from her and self-destructs once it assumes her human tendency toward self-destruction, but in my view, the alien itself is not conscious. (When Lena is asked whether the alien is carbon-based or sentient, she replies, ""I don't know."" And neither do we.) But, that being said, if the alien itself is simply the process of replication, the clone may still be conscious, but it would be the replication of Lena's consciousness. A human consciousness. And whether or not this consciousness exists all comes down to your personal beliefs: is consciousness simply a property of our brain's physical structure, or is it something mystical, metaphysical?

Finally, a word on memory. Many have interpreted the flashbacks scattered throughout the story to be no more than a cinematic technique to establish backstory. In real life, however, our memories are always changing, and we never remember the initial memory itself but rather our most recent recollection of it. Might not the flashbacks be Lena's memories when she is in the shimmer, which are being corrupted, refracted by the prism, scrambled just like the radio waves? As /u/thecoffee_ mentioned below, the house where the bear attacks appears to be the same as Lena's in her flashbacks. Could this be a refraction, a psychological merging just as there are physical merges in the shimmer? This theory would also explain what several users have pointed out about flashback Kane not appearing the same or having the same accent as the one in the video. That doesn't prove that the Kane who emerged from the shimmer was the original, but simply that Lena's memories were corrupted by the refraction. In the end, for both the audience and the characters, it's impossible to know.",7zqsdy

Also, the ending scene where Natalie Portman is watching the video of her husband with the phosphorus grenade and how she ends up doing the same thing with her duplicate... how she has that duel with herself... it had my mind racing the whole time. I was questioning whether the film was going to go the alternate dimension route or leave it as an anomaly.

I honestly wouldn’t have minded the film fleshing out the resolution more, what were the lasting effects of the shimmer, did the public get wise to what happened? I guess that’s why I’m not a producer or director, though.

Overall one of my favorite movies I’ve seen. I put it up there with Interstellar, Ex Machina, and Arrival in terms of wonderful cinematic rides that have me thinking about them for a long time afterwards.

dwkbebl,"After some thought: my theory is that the contents of people's minds and bodies got refracted into each other with the end result being that Lena and Kane are a sort of twisted mosaic of all the other characters.

Evidence:

[1. The tattoos. Anya and Lena both end up with the same oroborus tattoo that was first on the arm of the soldier in the swimming pool video.

2. Kane had a southern accent at the end but not before his mission.

3. The fingerprints swirling on Anya's hands. Fingerprints represent the individual and I think them changing on Anya represent the other people.

4. The combination of plants and animals within the shimmer. The alligator is proposed by one of the scientists to be a ""combination"" of other animals (it has the teeth of a shark). The flowers are all different species intertwined into one. The deer that became flower-deer. The plant people. Sheppard's fear and part of her mind transferred into the screambear.

And at the end when Lena asks if Kane is Kane, he says ""I don't think so"". They still have some semblance of who they originally were (he went back home after the shimmer) but they still something new despite the death of the alien.](#spoiler)

Also he has great attention to detail with making the lens flare inside the Shimmer multicolored. The sound design and soundtrack, especially in the third act, is phenomenal. Everybody in the cast did a great job, especially Natalie Portman and Tessa Thompson. The scene with the bear was legitimately uncomfortable and horrifying. The climax of the film will go down as the best of the year. I really thought Garland did a fantastic job with conveying his commentary of the self-destructive nature of humans. I really don't like the framing device of this movie. It takes away some of the tension in the second half of the movie as you know Lena will survive. Some of the characters could use some more development. Jennifer Jason Leigh's character's motivations was poorly thought out. I understood her actions, but the reasons behind them kind of felt like Garland forgot to include it and just put it in at the last minute.

duyav52,"I just got out of this movie and I'm still reeling from it. However, I want to post a theory that has been touched on here already but not explicitly stated. I think the film is a giant analogy for cancer and how the disease is essentially caused by our own cells, replicating out of control. It is the perfect example of biology's self-destructive nature. The entity of ""the shimmer"" and the horrible ordeal that the expedition team is put through may be horrifying and scary but I also believe it is not malicious. I don't think the world they are in wants to hurt them. I just think it wants to replicate and grow, and it does this so rapidly that nothing can really contend with it. Much like cancer. 

Also, I think the film explores themes of identity as well by invoking the question of Theseus' Ship. The characters' biological makeups are constantly changing as soon as they enter the shimmer. This is acknowledged by Lena when she is talking to the physicist about her blood. So when clone Kane (yes I do believe the living Kane is the clone) asks her at the end if she is really Lena, she hesitates to answer. Because she knows she is not the same person on a cellular level, so is she really any different from the clone of her husband that waits for her answer?",7zqsdy
dv6ztfz,"Too long for one post, sorry for dividing them. Spoilers ahead, in case my formatting doesn't work.

[As for Ventress being annihilated by her encounter with the Shadow, that scene crystallized for me the second time I watched it. Here's Jung's description of the ""merger with the Shadow."" I've emboldened certain text that I think the movie represents dramatically in the scene in the depths with Lena and Ventress and will explain them after the passage:](#spoiler)

""According to Jung, the shadow sometimes **overwhelms a person's actions**; for example, when the **conscious mind is shocked, confused, or paralyzed by indecision**. 'A man who is possessed by his shadow is always standing in his own light and falling into his own traps ... **living below his own level'**:[22] hence, in terms of the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, 'it must be Jekyll, the conscious personality, who integrates the shadow ... and not vice versa. Otherwise the **conscious becomes the slave of the autonomous shadow'**.[23]

Individuation inevitably raises that very possibility. As the process continues, and ""the **libido leaves the bright upper world ... sinks back into its own depths...below, in the shadows of the unconscious**"",[24] so too what comes to the forefront is ""what was **hidden under the mask of conventional adaptation: the shadow**"", with the result that ""**ego and shadow are no longer divided but are brought together in an—admittedly precarious—unity**.""[25]

The impact of such ""confrontation with the shadow produces at first a **dead balance, a stand-still that hampers moral decisions and makes convictions ineffective...tenebrositas, chaos, melancholia**.""[26] Consequently, (as Jung knew from personal experience) ""in this time of descent—one, three, seven years, more or less—genuine courage and strength are required"",[27] with **no certainty of emergence**. Nevertheless, Jung remained of the opinion that while ""no one should deny the danger of the descent ... every descent is followed by an ascent ...enantiodromia"";[28] and **assimilation of—rather than possession by—the shadow becomes at last a real possibility.**""

[I'll start by describing Ventress's posture when we see her in the depths, and her features (or lack thereof). Ventress is in repose on the altar, i.e. lying to one side, legs in the opposite direction, resting on one arm. She is physically languid. We get a close up of her face, and we see that she has none, or rather, she has the Shadow's face. This is the ""merger with."" She and her shadow are one. When Lena cannot see her face, it is that of the Shadow's. But when Ventress turns her face back around, her normal face reappears, i.e. her mask, her persona (read into Jung's ""persona."") Jung warned that the conscious personality, the person herself, must be the one who integrates the Shadow and **not** the other way around. But the other way around is exactly what's happened with Ventress. She has become a slave to the Shadow. Remember, she tells Lena that she had once wanted to know what was in the lighthouse, but ""that time has passed"". Note the sentence structure and subject verb. **She** wanted **to know**. She was the actor, the agent. But that time has passed. ""It's inside me now,"" Ventress says, ""and I don't know what it wants."" Ventress no longer questions what **she** wants; she now questions what **it** wants, and then she wonders ""if it wants at all."" There's a radical shift in her perspective, and in a way, it's appropriate since she's a psychologist. But she has been merged with the Shadow for too long. Refer back to what Jung says about the merging with the Shadow. It is supposed to be short and volatile. The conscious personality is supposed to go back up into the light. We don't know how long Ventress has been down in the depths of the unconscious. Jung warns that the union between consciousness and the Shadow is ""admittedly precarious."" Given Ventress' state, she's done. This is what her disintegration--dis-**integration**--means in the movie. She is annihilated by her inability to move past this stage in Jung's individuation and not a trace of her is left.](#spoilers)

[One final note on the brilliance of this scene. On my second viewing I took special care to look around the room in the depths. Lena comes down to the bottom and the camera splits its view between the way up, from which Lena descended, with a light at the end, and another dark passage. The juxtaposition is clear. But then we switch perspective, and **all around are dark passages in every direction.** I believe the message here is clear. There are many mistakes you can make in your encounter with the Shadow. Many wrong passages you can take, and only one way leads to the light.](#spoilers)

[We do not know how long Ventress had spent down there. After Josie's ""death,"" and the act transition (black screen with the word ""lighthouse"") we get a crying Lena, who very quickly looks confused and disoriented, much like after the team first enters the shimmer. I think another time lapse has occurred here. Ventress could've been down there for weeks, months even. Maybe she went down each and every one of those dark passages.](#spoilers)",7zqsdy

The movie encapsulates the greater context of existence and deftly inserts it back into its lesser component of human experience. Never have I ever seen something that so neatly proposes the essence of life as change, and so cleverly contrasts that idea with the limited scope of understanding that our human lives provide us.

dus7ja1,"I really enjoyed it. I felt it works better as a metaphor than a literal story. While the book felt more about the evolution of humanity, the movie felt more about the evolution of self.

The adaptation itself is very loose. It's almost written like the other books in the series don't exist. (Edit: I've been told the other books were not released when this movie was being written.) The plot structure is significantly different, but the story progresses is a similar fashion to the lighthouse. The spirt of the book oddly does feel very much alive here though. 

There's a lot of Jung and the shadow self psychology throughout the movie. The movie appears to be about the human drive to self destruct. It's about how far you go into a that darkness and if you pull out. In the end, both the biologist and her husband live, but their journeys into that darkness have changed them. They are truly not the same people based on their experiences; their old selves are literally dead. 

The prism effect that permeates the film suggests that the self is not as permanent as we suspect. We have many different selves. The right environment can leave us psychologically unmoored, wondering who we are. When we are in this condition things impact us more deeply. We suck up everything around us in an effort to find a new self, altering the DNA of our personality. At some point a new self is created and that is the self that lives on in the ashes of the old. Like the Phoenix. 

I don't know. Maybe I'm giving the film too much credit. Or maybe I'm full of shit. 

The problem with some of this is, if you read the film literally, the ending is a little clunky. It doesn't quite stick the landing the way I hoped it would. I think most people will rightly be confused by which version of the biologist lives, as based on positioning, the original self seems to live. The reveal suggests an altered version of her. Taken literally, it kind of has a ""the end?!"" sort of ending that you might see in a cheap horror movie. Obviously, not what the film was going for.

dush1x9,"I really really liked the movie. I don’t have much to say because I’m still thinking about it but I have two complaints. 

I would have loved to have seen more exploring and scientific research stuff on the plants and animals. For a group of scientists there wasn’t a whole lot of science going on. I really enjoyed the scene at the swamp house because we got to see some studying of the flowers and the alligator. But after that it felt that they weren’t all that curious anymore about plant/animal life in Area X. Also just more weird mutated animals would be cool. Seems like just the bear, alligator and deer. 

The other thing is I just cannot understand why these people were not wearing any sort of protection. If not a hazmat suit then at least some sort of mask or gloves. Like watching them pick up or handle things with exposed skin kinda took me out. It seemed they didn’t take any precautions to prevent infections or contamination. Especially when Portman mentions before the expedition that her husband’s symptoms sound like radiation. Like literally fucking anything could be going on within the Shimmer on an atmospheric level or microbial level. Why would any scientist go in there without some sort of protection?

Literally my only two complaints and I still like the movie a great deal, but the second complaint definitely stayed in my mind throughout the film.

dv6tr4r,"What struck me about the end is that the alien force seems to have no sense of self preservation. It mimics, even to the point of mimicking the grenade, which then ""refracts"" into everything the alien presence has created, causing the shimmer to self destruct. So, the alien presence seems to be on a parallel path to self destruction just as the human venturers into the shimmer. My interpretation is that the alien itself is some kind of explorer/scientist, just like the main characters. It doesn't understand our form of life, so it experiments by mimicking and making small alterations and combinations--just like an experimenter would do. So the message of the film could be that the quest for knowledge itself is self-destructive--not in the sense of suicide, but in that knowledge and experience radically transforms what we once were.",7zqsdy

You could read it in their body language that they were ""gonna go through with it,"" as friends and with trust in each other. There was no force involved in that scene.

[The most telling part of that scene was Kane's reaction to finding the worms underneath. That face was a face filled with relief and amazement. The typical reaction is that of the women's reactions--disgust, shock, horror. The reason this is typical is because, in passing, seeing the **actual** person, rather than just the simplified, surface persona we use for our daily lives, truly warrants that kind of reaction. People are messy, if you really get to know them, if you look underneath. Now, if we are applying Jung's lens to this film, then Kane's reaction to discovering the worms was because he had always felt ""something"" was wrong, either in his life with his distant wife who was cheating on him--of which he didn't seem to be fully aware--or in his, and his team's, experience in the shimmer. Often times, getting the chance to look under the hood, so to speak, and see that there is, in fact, something wrong, can be a huge relief. In Kane's case then, the problems of life weren't just a figment of his imagination, they had an objective, external cause and for the first time he got to ""look inside"" another man and see that he had ""internal"" problems, as well.] (#spoiler)",7zqsdy

When she's being interrogated by that scientist guy, she has an infinity tattoo.She didn't have this during the course of the film.I think there was a solider guy that had that tattoo when they saw the videotape of the former group.We know the shimmer reflects everything,so I think it somehow got reflected on her dna or something.

Is the shimmer actually dead?We know it blew up/burned but Kane is a clone.Also,lena is infected with it.

So the shimmer was some type of extraterrestrial force/enity that isn't conscious?But is dose have some type of innate instinct to destroy/create?

Overall,I thought this was really good.Alex Garland has knocked it out the park once again.

And I'm sure we're all in agreement at how amazingly haunting that bear scene was.

That said, I felt kind of underwhelmed and unsatisfied with the ending. The movie was building up such a great story and atmosphere, only for it to fall flat in the last 20-30 minutes. 
I understood the connection between the entity and cancer, but I just feel like the message it was trying to convey wasn't clear. Or rather, it was just too vague and open-ended for me to actually resonate with it.

Overall, I just felt like the movie was heading in a certain direction, only for it to do a complete 180 and just head the other way. I felt very frustrated with it at the end. ",7zqsdy
dwql0zw,"Interesting connection I had that some others have drawn - though it may be insubstantial. There is a book by Virginia Woolf titled To The Lighthouse, which is a very uniquely written novel where the climax is essentially reaching the lighthouse. 

It is a very different story, but does contain elements of identity similar to Annihilation. There is an idea of all things being 2 things, not one, in the same way the lighthouse was both the thing they saw far away in childhood, and up close as adults. ",7zqsdy
dxux3u7,"I know I'm late but I really wanted it to end before the final scene, where Lena and ""Kane"" meet up.

The film is called annihilation, and it explored so many meanings of that: annihilation of humans by cancer, our treatment of cancer by annihilating the abnormal cells, and, what about if something mutates into something else - is that annihilation? But in the end, when we thought the alien was annihilating humans, actually it was a new form of life that didn't know killing, and Lena annihilated it. The film had an amazing ending victory, soured with total loss, as the scientists find out that the alien was dead. I think it was a perfect ending, and the last scene with Kane and Lena detracted from that.

Either way, the last half hour was amazing (except maybe the scene where the alien bursts out of the psychologist).",7zqsdy

Actually the subplot of the affair is really pertinent for the decision Oscar Issac made. They all knew it was a suicide mission which is why Portman asked the psych if she evaluated her husband and why she thought it was okay for him to go... He went because he knew about the affair.  I thought that was his way of leaving her for it; going on a mission never to return.  The psych even alludes to this after portman asks about why he went and she goes on about self destruction: smoke, drink... ruin a good relationship... and at that point she looks at the psych all surprised and shocked, and when the psych says ""you can explain this better than me"" and portman immediately gets offended but the psych tells her its because she's a biologist, not because she knows how to self destruct a marriage.  

This is why the professor says ""you don't hate me, you hate yourself"" <- self destruction
Oscar went on that mission<-- self destruction. ",7zqsdy

dvusyz2,"The longer I think about this movie, the more I love it, as much as I find it unsettling. I don’t have a lot to say that hasn’t already been said, but I have a few interesting thoughts as a 27 year old survivor of cancer (you can tell that I haven’t used this account since I was in chemo and obsessed with r/cancer).

I found that the Shimmer was a very close approximation of what it actually feels like to have cancer and go through chemo. I can’t find it, but I made a comic during chemo in which I drew my stomach as full of eels; I nudged my partner during the swirling intestine scene because it looked just like that. The pain and the confusion of having your body change in these seemingly non-human/unnatural ways, needing to poison parts of yourself to survive… watching your friends die while for some reason you do not. I remember when someone told me that if they were me, it would kill them to not know why they had cancer, but I had to settle with not knowing. I'll never know. Lena's speech about the alien really resonated. Cancer isn’t good or bad. There’s no morality, just ambiguity.

Whenever I see a critique of this movie, I feel like I can find a corresponding experience I had during chemotherapy. The team members lost days, but it’s unexplained? I barely remember huge chunks of chemo, especially towards the beginning. Why the tattoo? My body is scarred from operations.

It’s not to say this movie is only about cancer - just that it feels like these themes of catastrophic change, deadly growth, dysfunction are being explored.

Today while listening to the soundtrack, I was also thinking about Bloodchild by Octavia Butler, which is of course about pregnancy - but still feels relevant. I’ve heard cancer called a “demonic pregnancy” (I can’t drink for 9 months but I don’t get a baby at the end!). While I understand the themes of self-destruction, I’m also immensely interested in the body horror.

I wish the characterization had been deeper, but I love thinking about and exploring the themes here. I love it. Definitely one of my favorite pieces of science fiction. I think that a good movie, like a good piece of art, should be open to many interpretations - so this is just mine.",7zqsdy

She's standing sorta awkwardly facing out towards the sea quite a ways off from the lighthouse.  If she had been heading towards the lighthouse, wouldn't she be closer to it when that scene started?  I felt like she had just suddenly come to, looked around, saw the lighthouse, dropped her bag, and turned to head towards the lighthouse.

When Kane was talking before killing himself with the phosphorous grenade, he said he used to think he was Kane but now he's not so sure. To me, this goes beyond just losing a mind. While she says that, yes, it was an alien, we don't really know. To me the movie started opening a crazy new book with this concept of a natural anomaly, a cancer on the world that questions the very existence of humanity and whether we are truly our own individuals.

I think that’s a little bit of a red flag, where did this woman come from? And her line when she said she had to “finish what she started,” what if this was all some sort of elaborate experiment by other “beings” trying to see what they could do to the environment and to see what they could manipulate, to see if they could successfully integrate into society.

dvz7v6r,"What an interesting film. I liked all the imagery of doubles, and the theme of self-knowledge/knowledge of others. How well do we really know our loved ones? How well do we know ourselves? Kane had difficulty identifying what made him him--and really, what does?

That scene on the couch, when Lena looks at her husband while they're both reading, you can see it so clearly--these people do not have much in common, they are alienated from one another. And really, who hasn't looked at a partner before and thought to themselves ""who the fuck is this person I'm with?"" Now she's literally with a person who is *not* the person she supposedly loved...but who was that anyway? 

The other theme of self-destruction was interesting as well. Each character was self-destructive in a different way, which was somewhat reflected in the way they went out. The brash, aggressive addict was literally consumed in a violent way. The cutter quietly disappeared. The anthropologist who lost her daughter to cancer dies hearing her own screams--for someone who has cared for a dying loved one with cancer, dying screaming in pain is the nightmare of both the patient and the caretaker. The psychologist with cancer literally disintegrated into a series of doubling cells (and depending on how you interpret the ending, possibly infected the alien presence with her cancer cells)
And Lena has to destroy ""herself"" in order to save herself--destroy the person she was so she can become the new her (literally the new her, since she's part shimmer now).

Kane - surname derived from ""cane"" or reed usully means a ""helping stick"". for Lena, as for any self-destructing person (e.g. addict), he was her's kane who helped her get by. Losing him is very scary for her and she wants to keep him even though he is not for her. Losing him also makes her go full on self-destruct and want to fight or die in the shimmer.

Ventress - surname derived from venturous, adventures. She takes them in the shimmer and simply want to ""face"" it. She starts the adventure.

Sheppard - this character was always calming them down. I think she was also the one to realise compass is not working but also showing the group where South is, where they should go. She was calming Lena down and all was relitively OK and protected until she was killed. After that, Sheppard's herd was on their own and anything could happen.

Lena - name that often meaning the holder of torch, a sunlight (truth?). Hence the torch (flashbomb) she uses to destroy the alien.

dv5qa8p,"My friends didn't catch these two things, so I couldn't talk about it afterwards.

1. The house they stay in, inside the Shimmer, is a duplicate of Lena's house, right? We see the stairs just like in her house, photos that we can't quite make out, a kitchen and living room laid out just like in her house. Oddly, the room where flashback-Lena spends most of her time, the bedroom, is never explored by the team. I believe it's not meant to be symbolic, but is literally a recreation of the character's home, as she does seem to react as soon as she walks inside.

2. What was going on with Kane's voice in the lighthouse video? Did he develop a Southern accent all of a sudden? I'm positive he didn't talk like that in flashbacks, and the not!Kane didn't talk like that in the kitchen or in the isolation room. And Oscar Isaac (who has a general American accent in real life) had a dialect coach for the movie, so something was up. Was this supposed to be a trait he inherited from someone else on his team when their genes got refracted? If so, fair enough, though you don't have to be a biologist to know that accents are not genetic (neither are tattoos).",7zqsdy
dv8bxe9,"I liked this movie okay. Some great ideas, gripping scenes, amazing visuals, but overall I found it pretty frustrating. There was a lot to love, but the film seemed intent on muddling up its really good ideas with less great ones (""Ah, okay so their genes are getting scrambled... wait why did the tattoo transfer over"" etc.). I realize there are non-literal interpretations to be made. I still want the surface story-line to make some kind of sense, or be reducible to some consistent themes. 

All that aside, I have one general criticism, and one question:

**General criticism:** The biggest problem with this film is not its inscrutable weirdness. It's that the basic underlying film-making was kind of shoddy. Some of the writing / direction / acting is outright bad. For example the scene where it's implied that one woman knocked out and tied-and-gagged three women in their sleep was totally implausible, as if the writer really wanted to hit that ""wake up tied to a chair by a paranoid cohort"" trope and didn't bother thinking through how ridiculous it would be in these circumstances. My point is, if the basic nuts-and-bolts of the film had been stronger, my patience for the lofty sci-fi elements would've been exponentially higher. 

**Burning question**: I guess the main question I'm left with is this: what was the ""motivation"" of the alien presence? Once again, this film seems to get in its own way. At first, I'm thinking ""okay so maybe the shimmer is an experimental outpost, annexing a bit of a foreign planet to run experiments on the living matter there, scrambling their genes and seeing what comes of it."" Then the expedition leader gives her title-dropping line about ""it"" wanting to break us down into our smallest pieces until we don't exist. Okay. So is there malice here? Then when Natalie Portman describes her fight with the shiny doppelganger, she goes so far as to say ""I'm not even sure it knew I was there."" I mean WHAT? Why even introduce such a concept? It's literally turning into a clone of you, of course it's aware of you. And in the end, the whole shimmer is dissolved and so whatever it was meant to do, it appears to have failed... while producing one, possibly two alien-human clone things... but it's not as though these alien sleeper agents have successfully infiltrated human society in the slightest. They're quarantined and under high suspicion. Hell Natalie Portman's recollection of Cane's suicide video pretty much spells out that the Cane in quarantine is some freaky alien. So. I don't know. I know there's plenty one can extrapolate in terms of symbolism or allegory, but I honestly can't be bothered if the surface level is this incomprehensible. I'm wondering if anybody got a clearer read about the purpose / goal / function of the alien presence in this film. 

",7zqsdy
dvgxbmp,"Did you all notice Lena's tattoo? It's an Ouroboros. That's not in the book, but is a very interesting addition to the movie. It represents the infinite cycle of nature's endless creation and destruction, life and death. ",7zqsdy
dvhvzw8,"Something ironic. Self destruction is a major theme, and cancer is a recurring motif. But cancer is literally what happens when normal cells refuse to self destruct when they're supposed to.

Incredible film. Creepy, suspenseful, trippy, loved everything about it... except that bear. I fucking hated the bear.",7zqsdy
dvzckhd,"Just a few random thoughts & questions:

Burning down the origin of the shimmer at the lighthouse caused all of the shimmer-generated life, like the crystal trees, to burn down. So why didn’t Kane and Lena burn too?

The talking bear was obviously inspired by Gene Wolfe’s alzabo, as several people have noted. Has anyone asked Garland about it to find out whether he’s a fan or if someone passed on that idea to him? (I’m assuming the alzabo was Garland’s decision since my understanding is that the bear wasn’t in Vandermeer’s novel.)

The ending seems to imply that the shimmer might not be a bad thing. To me, this is yet another example of a sci fi/super hero movie about mutation misunderstanding how evolution works. They focus on the mutation part but ignore natural selection. The reason why mutation ultimately leads to new traits that are useful and increases fitness is because natural selection weeds out the vast majority of mutations that don’t increase fitness. But these movies never show this. They just show new useful traits arising whole cloth in the first generation. Since the shimmer causes random mutation and scrambling of DNA, it would be very harmful, kind of like a nuclear disaster, and would result mostly in cancer and other bad things that would kill off the organisms. So there’s no way this could be a good or neutral thing.

Was Greg Bear’s Blood Music possibly another influence on this movie?

Why did Lena’s double suddenly become passive after she gave it the grenade and not continue mirroring her? Lena should have been blocked by the double after she removed the pin and they both should have been engulfed in flames.

Am I the only person who thought the CGI was kind of cheesy?

Why was Kane’s double dying at first but then suddenly got well after the shimmer was destroyed? You’d think the opposite would have happened.

How did JJL learn the things she said before she disintegrated? Did the shimmer communicate it to her? But I thought the shimmer doesn’t communicate and isn’t conscious?",7zqsdy

People underestimate this movie. I haven't managed to unpack it all yet, but I suspect it'll become a future cult classic.

Why?

Milton's Paradise Lost is SF before SF existed. In *Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus*(!), arguably the first horror/SF novel, the monster constantly quotes it. Paradise Lost influenced Tarkovski's SF films. From Solaris, Stalker to The Mirror.   Annihilation riffs on Tarkovski's movies more than once.

Annihilation is the story of tormented souls, who are heading to the light of a lighthouse, that has somehow been changed, altered or perverted by a being that fell from heaven. Milton's Paradise Lost, the story of a fallen angel and the fall of man, deals with the problem of [annihilation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/milt.12202). 

What happens with tormented souls? Are they burnt up so they no longer exist? Are they reincarnated in a body where they are forever tortured ? Do they return to nature? Or do they become something new? Or do they kill themselves with a phosphorous grenade? Phosphorous, is the greek for morning star. The latin name? [Lucifer.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus_(morning_star%29) Morning star? Also used to refer to Jesus aka redemption.

Portman has an infinity tattoo, which is also a symbol of rebirth. Someone is eaten by a bear, and becomes part of the bear. A creature falls from the sky. It turns a lighthouse, something which leads people the way to the light, into something else. Inside the shimmer, everything seems like a paradise, then it becomes hell.

Scientists discuss self-destruction, they discuss cells which potentially have eternal life.

TLDR Annihilation isn't about the annihilation of the human race, it's about self-annihilation. It's about death. It's about the destruction of self. It's about no longer being what you were, and transformation.

Is it possible that the lost time following their entry into the Shimmer is because they all made it to the lighthouse during the first three days, at which point they all got duplicated, the originals died, and then the duplicates spent the remaining time acclimating to their new bodies and minds? So, the duplicates fully ""awakened"" at the tents?

Isaac's character's duplicate seemed to slowly inherit memories -- he recognized Portman, for instance -- and got increasingly lucid, so maybe...the first three days that were lost are kind of akin to the way the initial years of our own lives aren't recalled by us? In other words, the duplicates were born and their aging was accelerated. So, in a day -- or whatever was left of the three days -- they aged enough to gain full consciousness. This happened around the time they woke up at the tents, which maybe they had previously set up in a kind of half-slumber/nascent state?

We see  moments of past, present, and then future. Repeated in a pattern. Past being the flashbacks of Lena's life before entering the shimmer. Present being her moments inside of the shimmer.

So my and my buddy's theory is that The Shimmer is essentially like a form of cancer. Much was made about the fact that no one knows what The Shimmer wanted, or even if it did ""want"". That tells me it is simply something that does what it thinks it should be doing -- much like regular cells that somehow get out of whack and start replicating into something malignant. 

Since The Shimmer is a prism, that causes anything in it to refract and ""mutate"", it not only refracts and replicates organic matter, but also thoughts, emotions, and desires. 
Organic matter was being replicated with the plants, gator, deer...and entire bodies of people in The Shimmer. 
Emotions were refracted and replicated as evidenced by the one woman who was mauled by the bear. The bear absorbed those final emotions of horror. 
Finally the refracted/mutated thoughts, along with a combo of organic matter and emotions, were manifested in the husband at the end. 

I think the reason Natalie Portman is the only one who survives to destroy The Shimmer is that she had something in her character that staved off complete self destruction: her love for her husband. Yes she was unfaithful, but she clearly did love him and face incredible remorse for what she did. At the end, her husband is a refraction/mutation/representation of all the organic matter, thoughts, and emotions from a combination of him and Natalie Portman. This is why they both respond to each other in some ""Shimmery"" way to each other at the end. 

This theory I'm sure has many flaws and inconsistencies though. It's almost 3:30 am here and I'm pretty tired, so forgive me for the lack of a fleshed out explanation of the movie, but if you guys see any ways this explanation could be further strengthened, that would be cool. ",7zqsdy

This being is described as both comforting and untrustworthy at the same time.  And you often come out of the experiences changed or altered in a certain way.

The monster in the cave who writes the words, and who assimilates you into his goopy mass. You drown a while, he takes over your brain in a painful way, you come out.

durbnck,"I'll try to avoid book spoilers here, because if you liked this movie I think you should read the books. I read all of them and they're some of my favorite fiction ever. 

I have a lot of thoughts and feelings about this movie but I'll try to organize it somehow.

1. Immediately after the ending, I was not happy. I expected this, because that is a hell of a book to adapt to film, but I actually really liked it EXCEPT the ending. Book Area X is not so straightforward and conquerable, but I understand the narrative needed to be wrapped up in one film. 

I came to like the ending much more when I realized the lighthouse scene is being told by The Biologist to Wong's character (in the book, the characters are only referred to by their professions, even by each other, for reasons I won't elaborate on here but I was hoping to see a nod to that) and we do not know the original one is the one that came back. Why would the copy mirror her every action only to freeze with the grenade? 

So let's say the pin is pulled, the biologist runs out, but the copy stops her again and only gets out itself (clearly it's more resistant to fire than a human). We see the sand glass trees collapsing, ostensibly signalling that everything area x made is dying as the lighthouse burns. This is confirmed by a team making it to the lighthouse and the shimmer disappearing. But then why would Kane clone be fine? And in fact recover completely? 

We know that Area X 'wants' to spread for some reason (quick aside, the books have this reputation of not paying off narratively about why area x is here, but you DO explicitly learn area x's purpose in the books and it's worth it). It can keep up its slow literal expansion, or it can go a different route. Area x makes a kane clone and it goes to the biologist. Kane clone starts dying, prompting the biologist to go in to find a cure/solution.  Once area x is ""destroyed"" and the biologist clone leaves, Kane is fine. Why? Because the sickness accomplished its goal. Area x isn't humanlike, but it does have what I'll call memetic preferences. The Biologist has a unique connection it via her husband and so area x latches onto her. I think this whole area x ""scheme"" humanizes it more than I'd do to the book version, but I also think Garland humanized Area x a bit so it fits. Why area x wants 2 ""agents"" out in the world, well I won't speculate.

2. Speaking of humanization, I think my biggest disconnect initially was seeing a human story when the book is a distinctly inhuman sorry. I did not get the clear theme of self destruction that Garland did, and that's fine! I read in his AMA that he only read the first book even as the others came out, so understandably there's some missing context to events in annihilation. In fact,  I'm of the opinion that if he had read the trilogy, he'd find it near impossible to adapt the first book in a self contained narrative. But this isn't really a complaint, since I don't want movie adaptations to just straight up retell the book on screen, just an observation.

3. The bear is a reference to a very different phenomenon in the book, I believe, but oh my god I thought it was perfect. A great device to instill dread and terror (that fucking scream/roar) while also teaching us about area x. 

4. I did not care for Thompson's character or her performance thereof. I'm still trying to put a finger on why, but I think it laid on the self destruction theme a little thick.

5. Can you tell I'm running out of steam by the length of my points? I loved the visual direction of Area x Garland took. It's much more subtle in the book but I think he nailed it as far as adapting it into something you'd actually want to look at on screen. And the score was perfectly haunting. I didn't care for song of the song choices, but all the original sound design was stellar.

durx8gb,"On a symbolic level, whether it was obvious or not, I saw the five characters representative of the Kübler-Ross model (aka Five Stages of Grief), all relating to Lena's affair

I literally walked out of the theater twenty minutes ago, loved it, was mesmerized, and so this is a real quick write-up, so please excuse a lack of elaboration or coherence or cogency, et al.

I'm just laying down some thoughts and would love if others can add to this because I'm still processing it.

1. Denial - Sheppard: we learn she lost her daughter which is why she's there, because everyone's essentially damaged goods and have nothing else left to lose. She even says that when she lost her daughter, she lost someone else too: who she once was. She's still in denial about not only the death of her daughter but about what she witnessed inside the Shimmer as well, admitting she's just better at hiding it.

2. Anger - Thorensen: I mean, come on. I don't really have to elaborate why she's representative of anger. Dis bitch crazy.

3. Bargaining - Radek: We learn from Sheppard that Radek wears long sleeves to hide her cuts. Lena assumes she was suicidal, but no, it's the exact opposite: to feel alive. And later on when they leave the house with ManBearPig, she chooses neither to find the source of the Shimmer nor to fight it. She's been bargaining over her life for so long, wanting to feel alive, that she's finally given this opportunity to be alive in a completely different way, which is why she was placing the blades of grass along her scars, and why we see her veins protruding and leaves and branches growing out of her.

4. Depression - Ventress: she's got no friends, no family, no connections, nobody; but she does have cancer, which explains her whole demeanor throughout the movie. She's not phased by any of what goes around them and volunteered herself to lead the expedition into the Shimmer in the first place.

5. Acceptance - Lena: After her affair, she feels guilty and ashamed by the whole thing which is why she enters the Shimmer, because she tells Lomax she owes him, her husband that is. Throughout the film we get glimpses into the past, of her personal life. I think maybe her husband wanted a kid but she didn't, or vice-versa. I only assume her husband wanted it because he's the one who brings up God and because she's a biologist who is focused on her career. Motherhood would definitely interfere with her career. I also assume the idea of motherhood is involved because of Sheppard, representative of a dream or hope which died early on, causing a rift between her and her husband. But this is all speculation.

It makes sense she's acceptance because she literally has to face herself in the end with that humanoid creature, mirroring her every move, learning to calm down so that it can calm down.

Even throughout the movie she and Ventress discuss the difference between self-destruction and suicide. We typically get self-destructive after doing something dumb like cheat on our significant other in order to cope with the fuck-up, in order to cope with loss.

But at the end, she burns down her former self and moves on, though considering the end, maybe it's the other way around.

But another also: fire and ashes evokes the Phoenix, being reborn in its ashes. etc. etc.",7zqsdy
duu53w5,"This is a really good film. Lot to digest here. I had an hour long car ride home after watching the movie so had some time to mull it over. Just going to kind of write down my thoughts before I start reading anything else so I can see how wrong I am about things. Not a serious review. 


This film is very reminiscent of Tarkovsky's ""Stalker."" I understand that this film is an adaptation of a book, but it's pretty clear that Stalker was a big influence for this film. Anyone who likes this film should probably check that film out. Although, Stalker is more minimalist and purposefully boring at points. 

First off the film is pretty visually stunning. Lot of really imaginative creature design and the general set design with the Shimmer was just awesome. Really loved the imagery with the lighthouse.

There's of lot symbolism in this movie. I'm sure they've already been pointed elsewhere, but the two things I noticed was how every interaction between Kane and Lena that was happening in the present and not through a flashback was obfuscated in some way or seen through some sort of lens which distorted everything. Their hands through a glass of water or them being filmed through a tarp/blue glass. There's always something separating them. 

The other thing I noticed was there was a lot movement with hands for two of the characters. Ventress and Lena were never static during certain scenes. The scene with Lena and Kane on the bed had her constantly fidgeting with Kane's fingers. Just really interesting way of showing how these characters were very restless. 

What I found interesting is that the film had a lot of archetypal characters and this seemed to be pretty deliberate. It was as if the purpose was to show how the Shimmer reacts to how different people approach it.

* Ventress - the mastermind behind everything. Has her own personal reasons about venturing the lighthouse. Wants to satiate her own curiosity and lets the Shimmer envelope her. She has nothing left to live for so she doesn't care if it's a suicide mission.
* Josie - reflective. Accepts her fate. Lets herself become part of the Shimmer. This character would be the one to swim out to sea in a shipwreck film. 
* Thorensen - clearly doesn't belong in the Shimmer. Is less academic than everyone else and both her body and mind are torn apart by the Shimmer. Kind of reminds me of Husdon from Aliens.  
* Shepard - not sure how this character fits in. She does have a mini dialogue about how she's kind of fractured after the passing of her daughter. She's even more fractured after having her throat ripped out by a bear. That was pretty horrifying. 

The other two characters are Kane and Lena. We understand Kane is self-destructive. He's aware of Lena's affair. Probably doesn't have much will to live, hence we he doesn't fight off the Shimmer and instead lets it replicate itself and take his place. Since he's apparently been in the Shimmer for a long time at that point, it seems like his mind has been fragmented and all that's left of him is this doubt. 

Lena seems pretty driven to figure out what happened to her husband. Unlike Kane or anyone's that has been to the lighthouse, she isn't broken. She manages to fight off of the Shimmer and ""defeat"" it. The whole end scene is really interesting. Not sure what to make of it. Maybe it's that you can't really defeat something that doesn't want anything. You just have to kind of let it destroy itself. Maybe. 

It's pretty clear that the Kane that wakes up is what's left of the Shimmer as it clearly isn't her husband. I'm not necessarily sure if it's going to continue destroying everything, or if it's just going to inhabit Kane. 

I do have to give a big shout out the bear scene. That was some straight up amazing creature design. Really didn't expect gothic horror in a film like this, but the bear replicating Shepard's scream is something you'd expect out of a game like Dark Souls. It was just a really cool scene and just outright horrifying. 

I'm looking forward to reading other people's thoughts on this film. It's a big step up from Ex Machina, in my opinion. Wouldn't say it's quite as good as other recent high-sci fi films like Arrival or Blade Runner 2049, but it's still really good.

duu7q0e,"What makes this movie so utterly terrifying is its unpredictability. Something that nearly every other modern horror movie lacks. From the beginning the editing  and sounds are very disorienting. The imagery was so creative, original and vast in regards to mood that I had no idea what to expect going forward . Not knowing what would be presented next made me feel this overwhelming sense of helplessness. I felt as if I was completely out of control floating in black space not knowing what was right in front of my face.  I’ve never experienced anything like it other than a bad acid trip.  It’s  truly amazing to know there’s still uncharted territory when it comes to horror.  I used to wonder what it must have felt like for people who first watched ground breaking horror movies like “the shining” in the theater.  To witness and experience “new” terror .Now I know.",7zqsdy
duuriru,"I really loved this movie, but primarily I saw it as a gigantic cancer metaphor. I'm going to try to collect my thoughts here, but forgive me if it's not totally coherent.

The lighthouse was struck by a something of unknown origin, and starts to change the DNA of everything in the area. This is almost exactly how cancer shows up in the body - a corruption of DNA leads to uncontrolled reproduction of cells. The shimmer was like a tumor on the Earth, constantly expanding and devouring what it came across. 

The five women who go in embodied the different ways that people can approach the diagnosis: acceptance, giving up, a desire to understand, or fighting. 

I saw the title of the film, Annihilation, as an interpretation of how you fight the illness: you have to take a scorched earth approach, and with that, risk killing yourself. 

Lastly, the alien-Kane at the end seemed like a metastasis of the larger tumor. He escaped the Shimmer and may start the whole process again. 

Edit: I also forgot to include how self-destruction (or apoptosis) is how cancerous growths are controlled in biology",7zqsdy

dvrkbhh,"WARNING SPOILERS!!!


I loved the experience of watching this movie. But I do understand the disappointment some viewers felt.  
Let's start with the biggest complaint - the logic.

* Three years of ""Shimmering"" and not a sign of total national response to it. No international response...no news. In the age of cell phones and satellites seems unlikely.
* All the teams send in didn't return. Still more identical, small teams are sent in without a proper support.
* The person who chooses teams is a dying psychologist.
* Lena is the only one with a military background but every team member was issued an assault rifle.
* Lena's team fights a huge mutated crocodile and then take small, aluminum boats straight over the same swamp that crocodile crawled out from.
* Lena's team agrees to use perimeter watch schedule created by Kane's team but they never do. Instead all but one sleep in a watchtower high above the ground. The only guard is static, exposed and alone watching only a small part of the area. 
* With the first sign of danger, the whole team rushes to an open area in the middle of the dark like they don't have a basic self-preservation skill.
* Lena uses night-vision scope only when there are bright light sources close by. Never in the darkness.

It continues like this throughout the movie.

As I said, I do understand that some viewers were annoyed by this.

Despite my eye for the detail, this didn't bother me at all. It didn't matter because the story and the backdrop created my experience of the movie.

I love the work put in to create mutations. My brain was looking at mutated flowers. At the first glance they all looked calming and familiar but deep inside it didn't make any sense. They don't exist. They were something new. Something not so easy to grasp by our Earth-trained brain.

That is the beauty of this movie. To grasp the unknown element with no motives, no plans, no communication. Just existence. Unlike ours. Not evil or good. Just indifferent. That's the horror of this idea. 

A viewer can choose to wrap his or her brain around this concept of unwanted and unexpected change. To mirror ides or own experiences in life. You get a nudge from dying psychologist, a marriage that is dissolving, the fear of change, the fear of the unknown, the fear of suffering and the fear of loneliness. Survival is the instinct that is a counterweight to these fears. Survival is essential to us and to the alien visitor in the movie.

The finale is a story of a new beginning, as I see it. Kane and Lena changed. Kane, a new form of alien life imitating ours and Lena our mutated life enriched (or poisoned) by the alien. Both one of their kind. Both alien to humans.

So, I loved the experience. Was it a good movie? My experience with it was great. I won't go into the details and remarks to common tools of movie-trade. As I said regarding remarks on logic...It doesn't matter.

I can say that music is fitting in the second part of the movie.

dxasvfj,"People in the movie keep saying the alien didn’t seem to have any desires. However, there is clearly agency going on with the alien. For example, the alien aims directly for a light house, rather that hitting a random place in ocean or land. Also, in its nebulous form, it was clearly displaying agency.

My take on the ending is that Portland doppelgänger was naive up until it’s flesh turned almost exactly like hers. It is then that she places the phosphorus bomb in its hand. At this point, it was part alien, part Portman. The Portman side of it realized that it needed to destroy itself/its lair, which is why it made the decision to start everything on fire. Why else would it willingly start everything on fire?

I don’t like that a phosphorus grenade was able to kill the alien, seemed like a cheap way out.  I loved the movie though (and it got better and better as it went on) I think aliens are more likely unintelligible to us, as portrayed in this movie vs other alien movies.",7zqsdy

duw3ukz,"Ill have to see it again, but heres my perception of the story after first watch. This might be kind of long. (SPOLIERS) 









I think the story is representative of the whole evolution of a cell thing that they established in the beginning. The ""Alien"" thing isnt just like every other alien that we see in most other sci-fi stories. It isnt some all-knowing advanced being that has some type of end goal or agenda. Its more of a biological self evolving life form with nothing but its own natural instinct to keep evolving and transforming. So the whole mimicking part at the end between Lena and the being was more of a representation of one cell splitting into two for its own process of creation. Cells are simply mirrors/duplicates of each other that combine to create the whole, right? So the being reacting and moving just as Lena does after it is spawned from her own DNA(becomes a duplicate of her) is the same process. And both Lena and Kane's characters react accordingly to such a bizarre/frightening experience. Kane, not being able to process and accept with human level thinking what has just happened, decides to kill himself out of disbelief and fear. Just imagine how overwhelming it would be to experience such an outlandish place that is literally mutating your DNA in the process, then have a duplicate version of yourself be born in front of you. Lena reacts in a just as panicked manor only choosing to kill the being instead. Which brings me to the ""alien"". (Again, my own perception). Im not sure if the being(whatever it was) was really a threat at its core. Sure, you can say the bear and the gator/shark thing were spawns of its mutation and they attacked, but these creatures are already territorial/more aggressive by nature. So when their DNA is being fucked with and mutated, it would make sense that they could turn into monster-like creatures. But now also think about the others beings/life forms it created. The vibrant and vast array of flowers, those harmonious deer looking things, the crystalline structures. You could argue that it wasnt really bringing ""Annihilation"" to anything other than what we as humans deem ""natural"" or ""normal"". And maybe thats what Tessa Thompson's Character kind of realized. Since she was such a broken and dispirited person, choosing to allow this sort of mutation or evolution to take place actually brought her some peace for once. Which would kind of explain why she seems so care free and willing to surrender in her last scene. For Kane also, his duplicate self doesnt seem like a threat at all to Lena. Not when he comes home or sees her at the end. More as if it was trying to adapt. It kind of alludes to the fact that this whole alien thing appears as a threat from our basic logical human mind because its doing something that we would deem unnatural, but really its just a sort of life form that humans dont understand. Something that evolves faster and different than us yet still using the same biological principals. So naturally it would create an environment that would be threatening and dangerous/strange to humans, but thats its way of evolving. Again this is just some of my own thoughts. Either way it creates for one hell of a sci-fi mind twister!",7zqsdy
dv249p5,"Man. What. A. Ride.

I have some questions and would appreciate any insight...

1) It seemed like under the lighthouse, there was a living cavity / network of sorts. Does this have anything to do with the other hole - the one in the pool where the array of body parts is? Are they connected? Or are they intended to be ultra strong areas of refraction where everything gets sucked in and jarbled? This could also be stranger things season 2 shaping my opinion...

2) Anyone notice that the bear didn't really eat Cass but instead put her at the foot of a tree? Is there an explanation for this?

3) If Lena's recollection is indeed accurate, when Ventress communicates with the alien, she seems to intuit that its intentions could be bad. How does this reconcile with ""Kane"" and his neutrality and perceived lack of awareness about his identity? Do you think he's in any way malicious and putting on an act? I guess I'm curious whether Ventress was really sensing anything or if she was so overtaken by the power of the alien that she couldn't help but jump to conclusions since the intensity of the thing was actually annihilating her.

dv53fry,"This was absolutely incredible. One of those movies where I leave the theatre going “what the fuck,” in the best way possible. Just beautiful sci-fi, a mind-fuck from start to finish. 

I had high hopes for this movie with Alex Garland as the director, seeing as Ex Machina is one of my favorite sci-fi films. Despite the apparently ridiculously ambitious source material, he did not disappoint. Like others have said, the dialogue could’ve used a bit of polishing at some points, but the visuals, the themes, and the overall delivery was great. 

I picked up the book as soon as I left the theatre, and I’m stoked to read it. I hope this movie doesn’t flop, because Alex Garland needs to keep getting funding to direct more films. Props to Natalie Portman for her awesome performance, too. Seriously good stuff. ",7zqsdy
dv57lkd,"Loved the movie so much that I felt like I actually swallowed some hallucinogen in the last half hour of the film. If I was to pick out flaws, I would say the flash backs did slow down the pacing, but nothing too much. In some essence they were necessary, and I like that they too were refracted, mixed up. I know people might not categorize it as horror, but to me this is an excellent sci fi horror, and I don't remember feeling such dread while sitting in a theater seat. Made me feel the same way as the book did, but even more intense. Such a beautiful, fascinating place that scared the hell out of me, and filled me with both awe and dread. ",7zqsdy
dv5n1wr,"Loved this movie, and I've been thinking about it nonstop since I left the theater. I want to see it again. 

One scene that stood out to me was when Josie turns into a plant person. She voluntarily chooses to succumb, and leaves start sprouting out of her arms willy nilly. Kind of like Dr. Ventress at the end, she willfully gives in to ""the thing."" Lena wants to return to the world so she puts up a fight. What a terrifying opponent - your own self, but devoid of any recognizable emotion or motive or any other human characteristic. So glad I wasn't on drugs watching that ending!!!",7zqsdy
dv8zdyw,anyone have any thoughts on the shot at the table when Kane comes home and its framed with the glass of water in the center of the table with their hands touching behind it. I'm not sure if there is supposed to be some meaning behind that like they are separated by the shimmer or something or am I reading too much into it? Then there was the glass of water again near the end so I felt like there must have been something to it.,7zqsdy

dvgwubp,"I've read the book, and I liked the movie! It would have been extremely difficult to do a direct adaption from the text of the book, since it is in some ways designed to be disorienting at times. There were some definite nods to the story.

dvjq7jm,That was freaking crazy.,7zqsdy
dvkafz7,So the Lena that got out of the lighthouse alive is not the mimic.  But the scene at the end when Kane and Lenas eyes shimmer means the alien did survive via its hosts.  I'm not sure what that means exactly.  Part of me thinks that she is still a mimic and not a mimic at the same time.   Like a more perfect fusion of Lena and the alien.  After 3 years of trial and error across many species the alien finally figured out how to invade our DNA while allowing us to keep some memories/identity.  This interpretation is probably wrong but I just love how open ended and though provoking this movie is.  One of the best representations of a true psychedlic trip.  Not just the visuals but the deep philosophical challenges.,7zqsdy

indhq8m,"For people confused about the ending or upset about the decisions the characters made:  
  
The director, Alex Garland, said this movie is about “self-destruction”. We can view that in two ways:  
  
\-Literal self-destruction, like the way a body with cancer mutates and effectively destroys itself or the way we contain the instructions to age in our own DNA  
  
\-And “self-destruction” in a psychological sense-Like smoking, cheating on a partner, going willingly into dangerous situations that you could have avoided, or hurting yourself “to feel alive”.   
  
Usually we can’t control either of these.   
  
Are the characters making “dumb” decisions, or self-destructive decisions?  
  
It’s also worth considering what “becoming a different person” means, in every context:  
  
Changes happen in life and we become a different person to survive. Relationships can make us a different person. Sometimes that new person is “worse” than the old one.  
  
We also physically become a different person over time-old cells die, new ones grow. None of your cells as an adult are the ones you were born with.  
  
Is survival always worth it if we have to become something else to do so? Is a relationship’s survival more important than being the healthy person you were or want to be? Is surviving cancer worth it if you become a shell of a person from the chemo anyway? Are self-destructive habits ok if they help you cope and survive in the moment?  
  
Is change fundamentally good,or bad? Or is it neutral?   
  
I think the ending is ambiguous because Garland wants us to ask these questions.   
  
(It’s also worth noting that Garland is known for trying to cram a bunch of themes and ideas into his movies, often to the effect of the plot falling apart because of it. So if you’re confused, don’t be too hard on yourself-he’s known for literally “losing the plot”. His newest movie-Men-was a HOT MESS in this regard)  
  
SPOILERS AHEAD

What changes if the Lena and Kane who survive are the “original” Lena and Kane vs. copies of them with their exact DNA and memories, but better at survival? Was it worth allowing the Shimmer to consume them just so some version of them could live on?  
  
Were Lena and Kane “different people” because of her choice to cheat and his knowledge of it? Was it worth it to do all this for the relationship to survive? Or were they both already lost causes going in? Do they get a fresh start if they both become Doppelgangers?  
  
We’re supposed to ask the questions: Does it really matter which Lena walked out of the Shimmer as long as her and Kane were reunited in some way? Is it better or worse if they’re both Doppelgangers?   
  
The ending only matters if you feel like it does, and it’s supposed to be ambiguous because it asks-if that’s not the “original” Lena, does that really hurt anything? Or is that better?  
  
Also, the movie constantly acknowledges and discusses the characters’ self-destructive tendencies-Lena cheats but hates it, Cass cuts herself to feel alive, etc. Ventress even talks about suicide vs. self destruction in regards to Kane’s choice to enter the Shimmer. These aren’t plot holes or “stupid” decisions.  
  
They’d all entered the Shimmer because they’d all become “different people” before they went in, because of their trauma and grief-Josie even says she “had two bereavements”-her daughter, and the “person she used to be”. So them making self-destructive choices makes sense-most of them had already given up on who they once were before the movie started.  
  
All the characters are then changed again by their time in the Shimmer, but some handle it in good ways (Like Cass choosing to become a plant) and others handle it in bad ways (Like Anya becoming unhinged, paranoid, and violent, ultimately leading to her own death).  
  
And that’s, again, the point. Changing as a person isn’t good or bad, it’s how you change and the person you become that matters. You can become self-destructive in response to life, but you don’t have to stay that way.   
  
Hope this helps make sense of the movie, I know this stuff can be hard for some people, and reading some interviews with Alex Garland really helped me get what he was trying to do with the movie-it’s not really about an alien so much as it’s about grief and self-destruction, and it really only makes sense with that context.",7zqsdy
duqbfyr,"I loved it. It reminded me a lot of a more complex, more deeply realized version of H.P. Lovecraft’s short story The Colour Out Of Space. I especially loved how little the alien life form resembled anything human, as far as it’s actions and motivations. Everything it was doing or did was just confusing, as it should’ve been.  It never felt malicious or sinister, just... alien. A lot of people in the theater during after the showing I went to were visibly angry. One guy yelled “LAME” when the credits rolled, and another old guy started yelling at his companions as they left that “IT DIDN’T MAKE ANY DAMN SENSE! NOTHING MADE ANY SENSE!” I can understand why the people that funded this movie would be concerned, although I personally am glad the director got to realize his vision. At the same time I think the majority of the audience isn’t going to be interested or curious enough to like it.",7zqsdy

And that it not necessarily had I’ll intent but just rearranges surrounding cells of all life randomly and strives to grow and adapt? I was sorta unsure if the light tower was symbolism for the life form, that’s its goal was reminiscent of the function of the light house, to guide the misguided and find a way home, as in starting life over and that humans may not be compatible?  Or maybe I’m overthinking it. That skeleton bear with shepherds screams really sent chills down my spine. Great film, 9/10 for me ",7zqsdy

dusi57y,"The movie was visually stunning, but it was the exploration of creationism that fascinated me.  To me, the movie represented the crossroads between science and religion.  

So this thing crash lands on some foreign planet where other organisms already exist, and begins the process of trying to adapt to its environment.  Or is it trying to adapt the environment to it?  It appears to hold no motive, or take any action, It simply is.  This is illustrated by its inability to really think on its own, and the echo of Kane only having those thoughts/memories imparted by the original Kane.  Everything taking place is a result of coexistence of the shimmer and organisms within it.  Or is there something more?  Is this an organism with a grand design for the future of life on the planet?    It has the capability to genetically mutate and create new life, much like a higher being might.

Within the shimmer, the physicist realizes radio waves are actually being refracted. And, we eventually learn that DNA of the organisms within the shimmer are also being refracted, leading to the hodgepodge of creations we see throughout the movie.  We are bearing witness to evolution and natural selection at breakneck speeds.  Or again, is there purpose behind everything unfolding before our eyes?  Is this someone/something toying with life, like mixing ingredients in attempt to come up with the perfect recipe?

The ending leaves us with Kane and Lena reunited.  Again, a crossroads between science and religion.  From science, Kane and Lena’s offspring would represent the next natural evolution of the original organism. From being a primitive, non-thinking, non-emotive organism, to one capable of both.  It led me to question how human existence might have started, and how we might have transformed from a simple organism to what we are today.

From a religious standpoint, the shimmer appears a proverbial garden of eden, with Kane and Lena representing a modern day Adam and Eve.  While Kane is the organisms first creation, Lena is of Kane in the sense that they share a connection.  There is a mixture of love and guilt that connects Lena to Kane.  They both ate the forbidden fruit that lies at the bottom of the lighthouse, and in the end are cast away as the shimmer disappears, the crystal trees enveloped in flame, much like a flaming sword.

Great movie, and one I’ll likely rewatch a time or two to see what I missed.  Or, to see if I totally missed the boat on what this movie was really trying to convey! :)",7zqsdy
dusk2sf,"Here's my theory


We noticed that Oscar Issac's character Kane has curly hair in flashbacks and a thick accent in the video. The COPY of him has slicked back hair and no accent. Those are errors in the copy process. We notice that Natalie Portman, while telling the story,  has the Ouroboros tattoo that the other woman had. we NEVER see her with that tattoo inside the shimmer. 

My theory is that Natalie Portman telling the story is an unreliable narrator bc she is the copy. When portman held the grenade she walked to her dead husband and touched him, then the walls and then went down to the core. Portman was trying to burn everything down. That wasnt the mimic. 

Both Portman and Issacs are copies in the end. ",7zqsdy

No clue where it was going until it nearly got there, but reveal after reveal kept this thing in motion. The last 30 minutes was something entirely else, and I'm not sure we'll ever get it out of a hollywood production ever again. One thing I found interesting was, [at the lighthouse, the white, veiny (flora? mold?) that surrounds the tunnel looks similar to the tree of life.

it's not just DNA that gets ""changed"" in the shimmer. Thoughts or memories get duplicated---like Lena's house being in the shimmer, etc. Also parts of others get mixed in with other people*----Kane gets a southern accent (in his video with his clone), the tattoo from the guy with the swirling intestines ends up on the EMT woman and on Lena. So DNA gets ""changed"", thoughts/memories are made physical and people get parts of others incorporated into themselves.

dwjcpf4,"Just saw he movie last night, so I’m pretty late to this party on insightful theories. Though, I will say, some of the fungal-like growths made me super uneasy. My first thoughts when they entered the shimmer “oh it’s just like alien, let’s go waltzing into alien territory where nobody has returned(besides Kane’s doppelgänger) with no air filtration/gas masks/hazmat suits”. That seemed unlikely in the real world. This resonated even further into the film when all the fungal, spore-like growths started to show up. 
The scene in the swimming pool arguably had me more on edge than the bear scene. Maybe it has to do with playing a lot of The Last Of Us, but when Lena starts to take a sample from the horrendous growth in the pool, I clenched my teeth thinking “that thing is about to bust and spray some toxic fumes or pull her hand in and envelope her.”
Fungal stuff freaks me out because it’s one of the more realistic dangers in the film for me(even if it wasn’t meant to be). Could the very air they had been breathing been the cause of the time lapse and various hallucinations/nightmares? I personally think “duh, where the hell are your guys supplemental clean o2?” Also during the pool scene, that person in the growth totally seemed like a clicker ready to peel itself off and chow down on some scientists.

Everyone here has had awesome insights on the overall meaning and events in the film. My theories and questions have already been addressed and then some. I didn’t really see anyone talk about the fungal-like aspects of the shimmer. Like a fungus, the shimmer doesn’t care about anything but growth and integration. Also for those who have played a game called Soma, this idea of a growth almost aligns with the WAU in that game. It is not trying to destroy humanity, it is simply existing, spreading, letting things live on through it’s integration, it is neither good or malicious, it just is. 
In the last of us(for those who know video games) there are many areas in the US that are so taken over the the fungal virus, but yet look so exotically beautiful as it does deadly. 

I haven’t seen a lot of people talk about this aspect as i don’t think it was meant as anything more than making the backdrop feel more alien and exotic, but I’d love to see some thoughts on it. In reality, if a group of scientists came across massive fungal growths like that, they would have at the very least been keeping their distance and holding their shirts over their mouths or some sort of safety measure for god sake. Unless they all really don’t care about dying, but as someone stated further up, if the movie doesn’t care about it’s characters, why should we? Shit gave me anxiety, so well done I guess.

Creepiest part of the film for me was the fungal-like presence that seemed interconnected throughout the shimmer. Everything seemed so beautiful yet so toxic.",7zqsdy
dzjduo1,"I didn't think the book was very good so maybe unsurprisingly I didn't think this film was very good either. Reminded me alot of Contact in the sense that it was pretentiously using sci fi as a vehicle to talk about personal problems, etc

I would have preferred it to just be a straightforward exploration movie, since I find first contact with aliens who can warp parts of earth to be hellish death traps to be interesting enough to sustain me for 2 hours, and I do not find ""cells divide! biological self destruction!"" x 10 to add much of anything to it at all

Like from when we first saw Kane come back (after we saw Lena's lecture on cells and replication) I was thinking he was going to be a clone or something.  The last act was pretty cool but even then I was kind of underwhelmed.  I'm not too sure why.

I also felt the affair was kind of rushed, some of the lines were corny, and I'm not sure why they gave everyone guns?  It didn't look like anyone else besides Lena had training.

duq6a47,"This movie was good, sometimes really really good. But I wanted to love it and I wanted it to be great, and it fell short of that in my opinion. It was thought provoking but I have a lot to say about what frustrated me. 

Little details that bothered me started adding up. 

Oscar Isaac's (pointless) bad southern accent was distracting. 

The first time we see them play a video on a camera with no dead battery was forgivable, they probably just hadn't turned it on until then. But when it happens again at the end, that pissed me off. Why would there be battery in the camera Oscar Isaac used when he set himself on fire? Wasn't it stated that that would have been sitting there for at least a year? 

The framing device of her talking to the guy in the hazmat suit with flashbacks was unnecessary for me, and I think it actually takes away from the mystery. The entire film we already know that she got out (even if it isn't exactly her). 

I didn't like the cliche'd turn that the tough girl (can't remember the character name) took. She starts freaking out immediately and wants to turn back and leave the shimmer after one of them dies. Why? Wasn't it established that this is a suicide mission, don't they all know the details before entering in the first place? Her turning on everyone just felt like a story beat that we see time and time again in these kinds of films. You can say the shimmer caused her to go crazy and that's a fair explanation, I just think on a narrative level I'm tired of seeing that always happen. 

The film explained itself too often (until the third act). The bear scene was legit one of the most effective horror/sci fi sequences I've ever seen, it was masterful. And it was mysterious why the bear was making the sound of the girl who died. I was piecing it together in my head why that was, and it would have been so so much more effective if they had not had the line of dialogue afterwards explaining it all to me. This happened very often in the first two acts, I actually thought the movie spelled itself out too often and would have been better if it was even more ambiguous. 

All that being said, I'm holding it to a higher standard because it's approaching the league of excelling cerebral Sci Fi and I love everything that Garland does. It reminded me a lot of Tarkovsky's Solaris, but again Solaris is a movie that doesn't have expository dialogue and instead lets me decide what's going on. Annihilation does get there during the last act and the scene at the lighthouse. I loved that sequence so much, the music the atmosphere the visuals, really great stuff. The mirroring alien was so bizarre. 

A lot of this works on a metaphorical level, beyond just plot explanations. The nature of the shimmer if fascinating stuff, what it does to us and what it's doing to the world. Lots to wrap my head around which is great. 

Great horror stuff in there. The pacing didn't bother me as much as it did everyone else, I liked the slow burn because it built up the suspense. The payoff worked enough for me too. I'll watch this one many times and hopefully repeat viewings make me appreciate it more than I already do. ",7zqsdy

dv41tru,"I've seen the film twice now and here's my review and analysis. 

This movie is a slow burn. Even in moments of high tension, the pacing is deliberate. Good performances. Initially I thought the characters lacked chemistry, but narratively it's more satisfying. This is an ""action"" movie the same way Sicario was an action movie. It's a lot of tension and confusion that occasionally resolves in some action. This film has elements of horror but it's a textbook sci-fi, and not like Star Wars but *real* sci-fi.

9/10. Great visual storytelling and attention to detail makes this film very thought provoking. This film is along the lines of films like Blade Runner or The Matrix in the way it questions the audience what it means to be human. This film has a unqie cinematic experience that I'm sure will divide audiences, but I can honestly say I love this film. There's a few minor plot contrivances, and a couple of lines where one character just states the obvious which was kinda dumb, but none of these nitpicks really hurt my enjoyment of the film. 

What this film and ending mean [This is a film about self-destruction and the primary visual and sci-fi motif is refraction. Everyone in this film engages in some form of self-destruction. I found it ironic that the only character that isn't self-destructing through escapist behavior is dying of cancer. All the characters ultimately fall victim to the things they bring with them; the character worried about being killed by her partners tries to kill her partners, Josie's scars start sprouting leaves, Lena's guilt for infidelity manifests in being mistrusted by her teammates, etc.](#spoiler)

[I don't believe the shimmer was an alien, or that anyone was cloned. I think the shimmer was just some object like a glass of water. Garland shows us shots of characters moving their fingers in front of water, I took this to be a visual metaphor to be what is happening in the shimmer. It's clear that the shimmer refracts all the laws of nature and consciousness the same way water refracts light. The *clones* are just refractions of that person's desire. Kane love's his wife, but decides he'd rather die than confront her about her affair. Lena wants to punish herself for the suffering she put her husband through. These desires ultimately manifest when refracted through the shimmer. Lena and Kane both learn that they were not the people they thought they were. Through this realization, they finally begin to heal their relationship.](#spoiler)

[Other themes and motifs were creation, duplication, and change. ](#spoiler)

dvpc7uo,"Okay, so, I just got back from seeing the movie for the third time. I’m so glad I’ve seen it three times, as everything makes so much more sense to me now than it did after the first. I have a few thoughts:

- We see the flashback scene from Lena’s memory of the morning Kane left to go on his “secret mission.” He was acting very strange that morning, didn’t really show much emotion or facial features, and he spoke in a monotone. His hair was also slicked back, just like clone Kane’s is, and he was wearing the exact same outfit that clone Kane was wearing in the scene where he came back from the Shimmer to find Lena. I’m a little confused as to why everything is so similar before human Kane left vs when clone Kane came back. Human Kane hadn’t even gone into the Shimmer yet, but CLONE Kane came out acting the exact same way that Human Kane did before clone Kane even existed.

- I know this was mentioned already in an older thread, but it’s super interesting to me that the house where ScreamBear kills Anya is Lena’s same house from outside of the Shimmer. When clone Kane comes to find Lena and stands at the bottom of the staircase and looks at the photos, it’s the same shot when Lena enters the house and has a look of recognition on her face. There is one photograph on the wall, and she turns to look at it the same way Kane does at the beginning. I think there is truth to the Shimmer refracting your memories into itself and making it a reality. It makes me wonder if that house was there for the past two years, before Kane or Lena had even gone inside? Or did it just not exist yet at that point in the Shimmer?

- The tattoo: I made a point to look for it everywhere I could this third time around. Here is the order of events:
    - Anya walks over to Lena to introduce herself. After inviting Lena to come and sit with her and her friends, she grabs Lena a beer, and pops the top off against the table. Anya then hands the beer to Lena, and we see the snake eating itself/infinity sign tattoo. 
    - Lena is in the canoe after the crocodile scene, and points out a bruise on her left forearm starting to form. That is the tattoo eventually coming to fruition.
    - The next time we see the tattoo is on the guy with his insides moving. I didn’t see the tattoo in the video on the camcorder they were huddled around; instead, I saw the tattoo after he had already died and his body was sprawled all over the wall of the pool. The camera slowly pans from his head down to his feet, and we notice the snake/infinity tattoo on his left forearm. But, if it wasn’t there in the video on the camcorder, we must assume that the Shimmer refracted the tattoo from Anya onto his arm AFTER he had already died, and at some point after Anya came into the Shimmer.
    - Then, Lena pricks her left forearm to draw blood to put it under the microscope. The tattoo is not on her forearm yet, but it is very clearly starting to take form. You can see it in an “under the surface” kind of way. Or, at least I could.
    - The first time we see the tattoo on Lena inside the Shimmer is in the crying scene, shortly after Josie turns into a flower/tree, where Lena is in the middle of a forest sobbing. It has completely taken form and is on her left forearm.
    - Then, in the lighthouse, when clone Lena takes form after human Lena touches her hand, clone Lena has the tattoo on her as well. 

Let me know what your guys’ thoughts are.
",7zqsdy
dvrmeer,"This movie was scary on an existential level... The whole of the shimmer is described through parallels as a form of cancer, and cancer is one creepy thing. 
I enjoy reading everyone's interpretation of the ending, and whether Lena made it out or a clone did, but I feel like it doesn't really matter.
What Southern Reach will do with the two of them is not discussed, and as far as we know they may well kill them and burn them to a safe crisp. 
My personal belief is that Lena survives, but comes back extremely altered.
As evidence of that we have her tattoo for example. It appears on different characters, and we can infer it showed up in Area X. 
Lena doesn't have it in her past, nor until the gator. After that she makes mention of a ""bruise"", which is located where the tattoo will soon be. The fact this conversation has screen time in a film with so little overall dialogue is meaningful, it's meant to make up pay attention. 
Then we see the tattoo on the dead guy painted all over the wall, and it's quite shocking since it's the same Lena has when being interrogated (at the very end). 
Then we see Anya having it... When Josie goes off to become a plant, Lena goes on her own and we have that weird cut in space/time, and when she brings her arm up as she cries, we can see the tattoo formed, quite raw and bleeding almost, like she just came off the needles. 
This makes me believe the Area leaves its trace (I mean she sees it in her own blood...) and she could be heavily transformed by the time of the ending.
The one scene that bugged me is when her blood falls into that tesseract mind trip thing, and is seen dividing. Blood cells don't have nuclei! Pick another cell type!!
*Ahem*

So about the fight with the Humanoid... Why is no one mentioning the state of Ventress when Lena sees her in the Lighthouse?? She is black skinned, eyeless, like a lump. In my head I immediately assumed she'd become a sort of living cancer mass, and then she turns around and appears to be fine. I then switched to thinking that this was an alien already. Especially since this tesseract thingy seemed to have needed a drop of Lena's blood to create her copy. Isn't that weird? You'd think if it exploded out of Ventress, there'd be plenty material to work from no?

When the Humanoid touches her, she starts morphing into a realistic version of her. So maybe she gets more than just the finer details, maybe she inherits some of her self-loathing, love for Kane, desire to see the whole place burn down, etc. 
Or maybe the Humanoid isn't the only one having a drastic change at that moment, and being on fire and ending the Area can have its benefits. 
After all, the moment the area disappears, the clone of Kane becomes healthy, like being outside its home was unbearable. But now there is Kane#2 and altered Lena, getting back together, and maybe that's enough for the Shimmer? 

Now, people who'll have read the trilogy may enlighten us. I have read only parts of it (found the first book a total bore), but I can tell you this:
in Annihilation, the reason they don't remember the first day is because Ventress puts all of them under hypnosis to do the crossing. Hypnosis is actually a major component of her character, as she can trigger suicide in the girls by using words hard wired in them through hypnosis. 
Also, in the book, Kane#2 DIES, along with all the other members of his team, who also ALL showed up as doppelgänger. 
The women's team is only 4 people, and there is a lighthouse keeper. Also Lena's turning is made rather obvious by the fact that she starts glowing.
The plot is very different, but Garland took the universe and made something very unique and cool out of it. Annihilation as a book is not a good movie, so I'm glad he didn't even try to go by the page.",7zqsdy
dvw0a2n,"There are a lot of themes to the movie. Self destruction, evolution, survival, immortality, etc. I usually don't write about movies like this but I really loved Annihilation. Here's what I think actually happens (sorry it's long!!):

[I think people should question why the clone of Kane showed up in Lena's house. The only ones who managed to return from the Shimmer were Kane and Lena, and they are also the only ones who made it to the Lighthouse. Ventress did not make it to the Lighthouse. She hints it by stating their bodies and minds were disintegrating at a rapid rate. That means her cancer cells were killing her much faster. When we do see her in the cave, the initial scene shows her without eyes. This leads me to believe this was not Ventress, that the real Ventress did not make it but died as a result of the refraction/mutation in the Shimmer. The alien was mirroring Ventress' final thoughts which brings us to essentially one of the most important quotes in the movie: ***""It's not like us. It's unlike us. I don't know what it wants or if it wants, but it will grow until it encompasses everything. Our bodies and our minds will be fragmented into their smallest parts until not one part remains. Annihilation.""***](#spoiler)


[The clone of Kane possessed some of his consciousness particularly his final thoughts about Lena, just as the bear creature possessed Sheppard's final thoughts--not just her voice. Josie actually comments that as Sheppard was dying, part of her mind became part of the creature that was killing her which was the only part of Sheppard that survived. I think the organism maybe collects genes, traits and consciousness of all life in the Shimmer by refracting, combining and mutating everything that comes in contact with it.](#spoiler)

[Lena, Ventress, Anya, Sheppard, and Josie were all refracted in the Shimmer in different ways. Lena confirms it after examining her blood. She also develops an ouroboros tattoo on her arm which was on Anya. In ancient texts like the Chrysopoeia of Cleopatra, the ouroboros represents transmuting something lesser into something greater (referring to gold). In other texts, It refer to immortality and the unity of all things material and spiritual. It also signifies the infinite cycle of life (creation/mutation) and death (destruction/annihilation). The movie starts off with Lena describing the start of life on Earth from a single cell, that cells create the structure of everything that lives and dies. Then in a flashback, Lena is shown reading the Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks which is about the immortal cancer cells called HeLa and the person responsible for them who is still ""alive"" today *in vitro*. This is a hint that everything lives on even if it is not in its original form.](#spoiler)

[But why is the Shimmer important? I think the Shimmer was a step in evolution for the alien organism. It was transmuting itself into something greater. When Lena finds Ventress in the cave, Ventress appears to be talking to herself, ""*It's the last phase. Vanished into havoc. Unfathomable mind. Now beacon. Now sea.*"" This makes me believe that the alien no longer needed the Shimmer to survive. As Ventress said, it was the last phase. The Shimmer was to vanish through havoc. Which is exactly what happens.](#spoiler)

[The vanishing into havoc bit is obviously referring to the fire turning all to ash. I believe the alien intentionally spread the flames and here's why. We know that the alien was conscious because it defended itself when Lena attacked it with the tripod. When it mirrored Lena, it felt like it was learning to move like Lena, like a human being and as the scene progressed, the alien started perfecting its moves. It didn't mirror her completely though. It prevented her from escaping by body slamming her into the door. But when Lena handed it the grenade, the alien happily accepted knowing what grenade is capable of after Kane's demonstration. Re-watch the scene.  After the grenade goes off, the alien watches Lena leave, and then spreads the fire starting with the body of the real Kane. It's pretty clear it's intentional. It burned all of the evidence to ash including Kane's body. It's hard to grasp that its weakness was fire. I mean it passed through the Earth's atmosphere, had the ability to teleport and survived gunfire. I believe it no longer needed the Shimmer to survive/evolve. It became part of Lena. This is made clear at the end, but before that...](#spoiler)


[Lena is a liar. Anya calls Lena a liar for hiding her relationship with Kane. This isn't the only lie though. She may have lied to the student who felt she was behind everyone else in the class by telling her she was doing fine. Lena lied to Sheppard about Kane being killed in action. She lied about her affair to Ventress on two occasions when it was clear Ventress knew. She lied to Anya and Josie about the coast being the best and safest way out of the Shimmer. She lied to Lomax (Benedict Wong) about not knowing what happened to Anya, Josie and Ventress. **She possibly lies to Lomax about all of the events in the Shimmer.** Maybe the organism picks up this trait?](#spoiler)

[So at the end, Lena isn't the Lena that entered the Shimmer. It is still her in some ways, but she is one with the organism. Initially, the alien was using the Shimmer to spread, but it no longer needed to be confined in that bubble to genetically mutate. Lomax tells Lena it came here for a reason, that it was mutating the environment and destroying everything. Lena's reply almost hints as if she kind of knew what it wanted. She says it wasn't destroying. It was changing everything. It was making something new. Lomax asks her what was it making and there's a long pause and she says she doesn't know. But she does know. She witnessed what it was doing. Ventress told her what it was doing. Lomax goes on to say that everything turned to ash from the fire and whatever was alive is now dead. Again, a pause and then she takes a sip of the water (much like the scene with Kane in the beginning--a key scene in my opinion), and just like Kane she has a hard time swallowing it down as we hear the gulp, only this time there is no blood. This indicates that neither new Kane nor the new Lena need water or food to survive. She survives four months without food before being found and she's fine with just a sip of water. Anyway, right after she places the glass back down, the water on the glass moves funny. It's easy to miss. Then she asks what happened to ""my **HUSBAND**."" Yep! This here confirms that her story to Lomax wasn't complete. It was different from the what we saw it as the audience. We can only speculate what she left out, but it's safe to say she doesn't provide any information about what actually happened.](#spoiler)

[I believe Kane was the imperfect duplicate while Lena was the perfected version or possibly became its host. In the final scene, Kane says he doesn't think he is Kane and asks if she is Lena. She doesn't confirm it or deny it, and both of them have Shimmer in their eyes.](#spoiler)

Now this is from the initial classroom scene:

>A single organism alone on planet Earth,
>perhaps alone in the universe.
>About four billion years ago...
>one became two, two became four

[That is probably the goal of this organism. From one it became two (Kane and Lena) and from Kane and Lena, it will became four, and so on. As Ventress stated, it will grow until it encompasses everything.](#spoiler)",7zqsdy
dw59qpm,"I thought the flick was alright for the first two acts, but it picked up a whole lot for me in act 3! The music & visuals really shined after reaching the lighthouse, loved that last act.  Also I thought that the scene near the end where Natalie places down the water after drinking it was honestly pretty genius on Alex Garland's part.  In a single shot, with nothing but a glass of water, he was able to capture a lot of what the movie was goin on about.  The refraction of the water as the shimmer refracted genetic code, the mirroring of Natalie's hand in reference to her shimmer double, and the water on the sides of the glass, pulling apart like two newly-formed cells finalizing their split.

I got a cosmological vibe when watching Ventriss's final scene? It reminded me of black holes, singularities, quasars (or it is pulsars....when the light exploded out of her mouth), etc. It made me think that maybe the alien isn't a sentient being but more of a phenomenon (something like gravity but not really.....hard to explain). It wasn't a being with purpose but rather some property or catalyst or something like a mini big bang. I don't have fully formed ideas about all this and need to see the movie again however I wonder if some people are attributing human qualities to something unknowable that is better explained by astrophysics or something like that.

If you think about it every character [who dies in the shimmer is essentially killed by their own baggage.](#spoiler)

[The crazy chick went in as a way to escape from her own personal demons, and ends up going nuts because of what's going on inside her and being killed by the bear (which I think is pretty much the embodiment of personal demons)](#spoiler)

I think the movie revolved deeply around themes of duplication, change and self-destruction. At many instances like the deers and the ending, duplication is there. 

Self-destruction is also shown and correlated with Portman and her husband's character. We are our own enemies and our actions are what ultimately end us. Their lives were ruined because of the husband's missions and wife's affairs. Similarly at the end, Portman's clone destroys the lighthouse and in the process kills itself.

But I can't figure out the logic behind where it appears. I caught it on Lena's arm in the interview scenes, Kane's shoulder in the flashbacks, the corpse in the pool's arm and (I think) on Anya's arm as she was breaking down. Why? Did it develop on Lena from her bruise? It's a tattoo, not genetic, so how is it jumping from person to person? Should I even be trying to consider it on a literal level?",7zqsdy

In the books, [the characters are constantly seeing otherwise normal wildlife that has a vaguely human feel to it, like the consciousness of the human has been transferred to the animal](#spoiler).  It provides a basis for the team to think that people are being copied by the shimmer.  It's a big part of the horror for me, that lovecraftian sense of dread in an otherwise normal setting.

The woman's scream provides a sense that she didn't just die, but she lives on in the bear in a truly horrific way, and that's part of the real terror of the shimmer for me.  I would never have been a clever enough screenwriter to visualize it through a human scream.

Jeff VanderMeer was inspired to write Annihilation after the Gulf oil spill in 2010 and its catastrophic ecological effects on the Florida coast.

I will however say that after reading the book [Gödel Escher Bach - An Eternal Golden Braid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach), this movie was so much more enhanced for me. The concept of the fractal is so entrenched in this movie. Hell even the original form of the alien is a [Mandelbulb.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbulb). The echos, the idea of cancerous growth or cells splitting, the interchangability of structure and form, the crystal tree... even the images of the credits sequence was done with a program called Apophysis (something Ive used to create different fractals myself). The emphasis of fractals and the nature of fractals pervades EVERYTHING in this movie.

Without completely exploring and explaining all the concepts of GEB, the main reason this is important to me is that Douglas Hofstadter theorizes that intelligence is in fact structurally like a fractal, and the self reference of I is a fractal form spanning into infinity. So it makes the alien intelligence not just the Mandelbulb we see, but the fractalization of the surrounding area as it expands and explores and tries to understand.

The biological reality of every cell in our body having the ability to self-destruct manifesting in our psychology is really interesting. It seems that she (Lena) passed that on “the being” in the lighthouse causing “The shimmer” to self destruct. I think what came back was actually the original/new Lena with a mixture of the DNA from the other ladies and “the being” in the lighthouse. 

It makes me think of the parasitic nature of humans and how we absorb everything around us and leave destruction in our path. The shimmer wasn’t there to destroy the earth with any intent, it was just there existing and changing it. Any other species of life would not have been able to stop it, and it would have just been a natural process of change over time. However, humans exist on this planet and we have the immense capacity to influence our environment for good or bad, usually bad. It’s interesting that Lena’s capacity for self-destruction was what ultimately stopped the shimmer. The fact that she willingly went into the shimmer and willingly went into the hole when other people would think in terms of self preservation. 

Haven’t really fully pieced my thoughts together but I thought I’d share and see if someone else can help add on. ",7zqsdy

dvqijr7,"It's presented as a Science Fiction but it feels more like a surrealist film about occult/enlightenment theory than any science theory. 

It has all the hallmarks of a film about find enlightenment/personal harmony and removing your illusionary self which you create from your fears etc. Like all the characters had problems they needed to shed in the shimmer and the main character resolved her relationship in there. So the basic things that stood out from this on first viewing. Might be some more with the whole ritual gut cutting and colour/number theory stuff but I'm not looking that hard at it: 

- At the start of the film she mentions the Axiom of Maria when talking about cancer cells which is an alchemy and Taoist phrase. 

>Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung (1875–1961) used the axiom as a metaphor for the process of individuation. One is unconscious wholeness; two is the conflict of opposites; three points to a potential resolution; the third is the transcendent function, described as a ""psychic function that arises from the tension between consciousness and the unconscious and supports their union"";[3] and the one as the fourth is a transformed state of consciousness, relatively whole and at peace.

>""Tao becomes one, one becomes two, two becomes three and three becomes ten thousand.Behind existence of every item
is a shadow, in front of it is light and as stabilizer is immaterial breathing.

-  fractals are featured quite heavily and this is a part of some occult or Kabbalah theories about the world. I don't practice any of this stuff but I know its in there. 

- Her husband took a meditation pose before he burned himself or his old self (which was splitting them apart) depending how you read it. 

- It seems almost too perfect that the shimmer collapsed almost like it was an illusion that they had created by entering after she had confronted her mimic self etc. Also that both her and her husband were like new people and their eyes where lit up like they had become whole again.

dvxmsb5,"I'll just put this here

Our two main characters are Kane and Lena.  

KaneLenaK

Now read that backwards.

Coincidence? Maybe",7zqsdy
dvxvmcf,"Really enjoyed the movie and just decided to share some personal interpretations. It seems that there are multiple themes and symbols into play.

0. Beginning of the movie vs The End

Always something to watch out for. So the movie opens with a lecture on how each cells are related - there was just one single first cell in the beginning. The movie ends with Kane (copy?) and Lena (original, but affected by the shutter?) embracing each other, with their eyes shimmering. That's the scientific explanation of how life came to be (evolution) vs the biblical (Adam vs Eve). Notice that the only two people with shimmering eyes are Kane and Lena - they are the 'new race', that will start from them.

Someone mentioned KaneLenaK reads both ways. 

If you notice just like Eve, Lena sins first - she starts the affair with her colleague. And just like in the bible the initial sin causes Adam & Eve to leave the world they inhabit (heaven, or the normal world) and go to a violent, dangerous place (earth, or in this case the shimmer).

2. Evolution, pursuit of endless life (no aging)

In the beginning the movie revolves around the idea that all cells started from one and that aging is a genetic mistake (and they even say it's not something ""natural""). The Shimmer actually provides a solution - you never really die, your cells do continue to divide, they just change, but in the end of the day it is your cells, who never age. Even in the case of violent death - you don't die, you change and become something else. That's the case of the soldier the previous group cut open - he became this grotesque plant-like thing on law, which was alive.

3. Is an exact copy less than the original?

I think the movie tries to suggest that there is not differentiation to be made between a copy and the original. The copy of Kane is just as much Kane as the original was. The copy of Kane had the shimmering eyes, but so did the original Lena. Just like two copies of a cell, two copies of a person are exactly the same.

----------------------------------------------
What I don't get:

1. The shimmer is all about scrambling radio and genes. But then suddenly it switches from random uncontrolled scrambling to producing exact 1:1 genetic copies? How did mutations and random cell division switch to perfect cellular division/cloning? That kind of contradicts with what the shimmer was all about and felt a bit out of place and continuation.

2. If that's the copy of Kane - and it most probably is, then why didn't it burn with the rest of the shimmer creatures when the lighthouse was set on fire? Similarly, why didn't Lena burn? All creatures with scrambled genes were set ablaze and Lena's genes were already scrambled, yet somehow she was spared.

3. How did the army miss the Kane copy leaving the shimmer? How can shimmer entities leave the zone in the first place? It was established that the shimmer creatures don' leave the zone, you don't see random creatures leaving the zone, but the how could Kane-copy leave?

4. If the alien creature at the origin was creating exact copies, then how come it did not produce a mutating, crazy and suicidal Kane, but an apparently much healthier and energetic version? That's not an exact copy.

Note that the whole trip they didn’t eat at all because they no longer needed to. They had no memory of how they got that area and made the camp while a few days worth of their food supply was gone. The original human versions were killed and/or duplicated after they got “infected”.

The real Lena returned, that is a fact. It is true, however, that whatever the shimmer is...it seems to be in her body now; in her blood, in her cells. So she isn't the same person she was before. It kind of makes sense to me in terms of the end of the movie and the theme of ""creating something new."" Because now she has a chance perhaps to create something new with this NEW Kane. If it was Lena's duplicate who returned...Lena's duplicate didn't have an affair. There would be no reason for Lena's duplicate to ""start new."" But for the real Lena, there is.",7zqsdy
e0shwqz,"Absolutely nothing against anyone who liked the movie, I know there's different tastes for everyone, but this movie was agonizingly tedious for me.

I just didn't ""get it"". Why was everyone speaking in hushed, whispered tones? 

Why was the team wearing WW2 era desert tan fatigues?

Why was there no real military presence to speak of? Other than handing a group of scientists stock M4's with no rail systems on them or any modular enhancements, there was no military presence with the mission. It was just ""send these women into the alien thing"".
Plus there was like, five of them.
When I was in Iraq, we wouldn't go on patrol without at least two squads, but these guys, in the middle of the most existential crisis mankind has ever known, chuck five untrained women at the thing and hope for the best?

What happened to flower lady? The one that wandered off. She just..poof'd.

And if they know the lighthouse is on the coast, why not start on the coast outside of the shimmer and just follow it up right to the lighthouse? Why go wander through the mutant woods?
Hell, lifeguards drive ATV's on the beach all the time, just drive up the coast on a 4-wheeler. Boom. Lighthouse.

I like my Superhero flicks but sometimes I really need movies that force you to ask questions and tell stories in a unconventional way even though it may not be the most comfortable way to sit through a movie.

This movie gave me exactly that. Not only the visuals were just absolutely stunning but there weren't cheap jump scares. I really enjoyed Lena talking about how some of the mutations in the Shimmer were not dangerous but absolutely beautiful even though there were some obviously monstrous beasts in the realm such as the freaky bear monster.

I also really enjoyed the scene where Lena meets the same alien that replaces Cane mirrors her movements and in a way that told me that she was the enemy and there was no clear antagonist in the film. Also, the way that alien set itself on fire told me that it didn't necessarily know what was going on and that it was being destroyed by humanity itself when it was just trying to survive in a new planet. 

One small problem though. The first 30 minutes seemed to drag a little bit with the setup and the introduction of the characters in the secret HQ behind the shimmer that seemed a little bit to dry dialogue-wise.

dv5su3m,"I agree with the theory behind this film; the organism trying to evolve in a new world and doing whatever it needs to do - even if it means annihilating the human race.

My interpretation of this film really comes down to one thing; Ego-Death. Specifically, drug induced Ego-Death; LSD, DMT, Shrooms, etc.
I learned that psychedelics force the brain to wire senses together. This is why we sometimes hear people saying that they can SEE music or HEAR an emotion. It's a very common experience. 
Within Area X, there's a reverse cell division occurring, in which living organisms and materials are being forced into each other to create a unity. Psychedelics trips do this to the brain - they begin to pull sensations together to the point that you can't even determine which sensation is being influenced by an external force.
Moreso than that, consciousness and the part of the brain that regulates self-identity begins to power down. This makes the users feel like they ""are one with nature."" 

What's happening is that because the part of the brain that regulates self-identity begins to disappear, the consciousness begins to find an excuse for it's own living... We start to resort to a singularity. A point in which all this are ONE. It goes deeper.

We are now in a state of mind in which we cannot determine our existence. We lose sight of reality and all that is left in question is ""What is this?"" I can't seem to explain much after that, except that we become face to face with ourselves. Our reflect; staring into our own soul and wondering who this person is in front of us. They do everything we do. They are us? But how can they if we are standing here? 
If feels like the ""fight"" Scene between NP's character and her mimic. That entire scene is a depiction of ego-death; ""complete loss of subjective self-identity.""
Whatever happens in that fight is entirely personal to the victim/subject. Whoever comes out from the fight is the winner. NP's character came out alive. She killed herself but it does not matter that her mimic died. It doens't matter that ""real"" self came out alive. All that matters is the experience and the result. The shimmer in her eyes is nothing more than an evolution of herself. Its stupid to wonder who came out alive and debate it's events. All that really matters is that this ""new"" person will be able to expand her new identity into the world, for people to marvel and be influenced by it. To see themselves and annihilate the person they will see in the mirror - only the strongest survive.

I appreciate the strong female cast too, because it seems like Hollywood loves to just take something that already exists, change the gender, and take credit for being feminist.

I also thought it was a little weird these people would go in knowing full well that other people had disappeared. Natalie Portman's character motives made more sense, but the other individual's motives for going on a possible ""suicide mission"" made less sense. Comparing it to Alien Covenant or Prometheus, it wasn't chock full of these logic gaps, but there were a few initially. 

The psychological element to the movie was good and reminiscent of Ex Machina. My interest was definitely maintained throughout the movie and the ending was vague but in a good sort of way. I haven't read the book, so I can't really compare it to that.

just like in the shimmer, but more centralized into Kane and Lena's bodies.

Most movies deal with humanoid aliens that we have some common ground with.  Something like the alien in this movie that is beyond our experience and perhaps comprehension is were the real terror seems to lie.  Something that you can't reason with anymore than you can reason with a tree and you have no control over.  That seems to scare people the most and I think sci fi needs more of that.  There are a lot of interesting ideas to explore in that realm.

I think too many people who don't get that premise will and have just dismissed it as being nonsensical and riddled with plot holes.  The whole point is it isn't supposed to make sense to you, you're human.  The alien is functioning on its own mysterious agenda.

At least that's what I got out of it, perhaps I'm projecting a bit of my desire to see that kind of sci fi.  Something on the level of Event Horizon's ""you won't need eyes were we're going"" type of out there explorations.",7zqsdy
dvqiirv,"Honestly, that scene with the bear is a masterclass on how to build tension and create genuine fear. No bull crap jump scares, just pure terror. 
I loved the bizarre, out there ending. It felt like real science fiction and I really appreciate when a director does exactly what he/she wants to and refuses to change it because of producers or audience opinion. This was Alex Garland’s movie and it you can see that everywhere. 9/10 baby 👍🏻",7zqsdy
dw0wbgq,"In addition to the obviously impressive visuals and set/art design, I was really impressed by the amount of subtle flecks of weirdness throughout the film, some of which made you do a double take (e.g. the tattoo appearing on the different characters). Pure mindfuck territory.

I thought it was a superb film.

My only complaint is that I watched it on Netflix. This didn't seem the biggest deal until the final lighthouse scene, I could just tell that was made for the big screen and a powerful sound system. And what an intense, psychedelic scene that was. 

While I'm a big fan of Alex Garland's writing and have been for a number of years, I am probably in the minority in that I didn't think all that highly of *Ex Machina*. However, this has definitely got me very interested in seeing what he does next as a director.",7zqsdy
dwnvsfh,"Ok so my theory as far as it goes: The asteroid crashed on Earth, bringing aliens and ""the shimmer"". What the purpose of the ""shimmer"" is, we don't know. To the aliens, all the plants and animals around are made of cells, and the humans are no different than any other form of life. 

When human after human starts coming to the lighthouse, the aliens begin to realize that there may be something different about humans. The fact is, they're aliens, and how we perceive life and how we communicate and even how we think or process information is different to them, which is why when a human comes to the lighthouse they try to emulate our entire body so that they can understand what it is we want. 

When Kane dies, he wants to protect Lena, so the aliens send out a doppleganger to watch over Lena and when she enters the shimmer it does not harm her. When Lena's doppleganger is made, she wants the aliens after all the carnage she's seen and so her doppleganger stops the shimmer and the aliens leave. ",7zqsdy
duymp8p,"Watched this last night and thoroughly enjoyed it. Reminded me of a Charles Addams quote I really like. 

> Normal is an illusion. What is normal for the spider is chaos for the fly.

The scenes where Lena's questioned after returning really build upon this. Lomax (Benedict Wong's character) asks her what the shimmer wanted and why it did what it did, which is both a realistic and human response to an alien life form landing on our planet. To build upon what others have said though, the answer is far more complicated. 

The Shimmer doesn't abide by our confines of normality. To me, it was ""intention-less."" I don't think it held a notion of good vs. evil. It was just existing, being. Because its existence interfered with ours and disrupted our boundaries of normal though, we viewed it as chaos. The shimmer is the metaphorical spider, and we are the flies. ",7zqsdy
dvuvsyo,"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but it feels like a lot of the negative reviews this film is getting is because viewers aren't understanding the concepts explored in the film. The ending is especially controversial which is what ruined the theatrical release of the film worldwide. I agree, the film definitely has its flaws. Describing the film as a load of rubbish, I completely disagree with.

I'll start from the beginning.

Lena says to her class:
>""The cell we're looking at is from a tumor. Female patient, early thirties, taken from the cervix. Over the course of the next term, we will be closely examining cancer cells in-vitro and discussing autophagic activity.""

A major concept explored in this film as you already know is cancer mutation. The meteor crash landing on Earth can be thought of as a virus invading a cell. As the shimmer is expanding, it is consuming more of the Earth and causing abnormal mutations similar to cancer cell growth in the body. ""Autophagy""  is a term which simply translates to ""self-devouring."" The idea of self-devouring is portrayed in the film a number of times and relates to the main theme of Annihilation, humans and their self-destruction. Why do we drink until we feel sick to our stomach? Why do we smoke even though we know it affects our lungs? Why do people have affairs when they are happily married? It is because of our self destructive tendencies. When Lena is being interrogated by Lomax, we see her left forearm having the tattoo of ""Ouroboros."" The symbol comes from Egyptian iconography and depicts a serpent consuming itself. It also represents the infinite cycle of nature's endless creation and destruction, life and death. It implies that this self-consuming infinite cycle is unbreakable and almost feels tangible when looking at the world from a certain angle. This is what the film does, it looks at it from a certain angle.

>It's an intrinsic and tangible portion of us (cancer, failed relationship, a daughter's passing and the blame shouldered, a woman seeking to fill an existential void...) and our unique self-destruction that the aliens are replicating at their peak function. It's why the Bear is screaming in Sheppard's voice. It captured her final cries from her voice box, as opposed to her brain. This choice is intentional. It demonstrates that our tendency to existentially implode is hard-wired in an almost hereditary manner.

>Everyone shares some tragedy or internal crisis that propels us toward our own annihilation. We struggle to feel worthy of existence itself and that is so strong, it is passed onto a life-form capable of manifesting it with literal and objective corporeality.

>In the very end, bullets cannot challenge the adapting creature's existence because it is mimicking humanity. It only falls after it takes it's own life and it's own submissive existence is forced to expunge itself unto Lena. It tries aggressively and cannot succeed. It only succeeds when it gives into it's own destruction and ""perfectly adapts"", so to speak.

>Look at the answers from anyone potentially influenced by the Alien. They offer that they ""don't know"" or show doubt when discussing what has happened, from a soldier to a qualified biologist. Is Ventress? I don't know but her understanding leads to the alien coming closer to the realization that self-destruction is humanity's strongest internal (and perhaps repressed) drive so it takes several transfers, duplications, and even assimilation to finally reach this conclusion and it profoundly changes the alien and normalizes it into the human hierarchy. It has adapted to our instinctual low-humming of how we must expire with finality to inch forward to do it once more.

>The alien effectively becomes a living, breathing, and physically existing manifestation of self-destruction. The movie argues that perhaps we are as well, which is why everything is normal at the end (When Kane and Lena reunite and are totally unsure of their own identities) except for ""shimmers"" (yeah, heard ""shimmer"" before?) in the eyes of both Kane and Lena. We, as people, ""don't know"" because Lena encounters a mimicking shadow of ourselves that refuses to let her leave even though it mimics her. No, not mimics her... It's her self-defeating effigy. That instinct to collapse within ourselves comes full circle and the serpent eats once more.

To expand on the ending of the film, there is a point earlier in the movie where Sheppard and Lena are getting to know each other and talk about their lives. Sheppard says ""All other lives feel like a lifetime ago."" Sheppard then goes on to explain that she lost her daughter to Leukemia and therefore has two bereavements, her beautiful girl and the person she once was. She also explains that Anya was sober and Josie was hiding her scars. This portrays the notion that sometimes we are able to overcome our self destructive tendencies and become what we like to think of as a new person. Some people aren't able to do this and eventually succumb to it (i.e. suicide, drug overdose, divorce etc.) Just as the cells in our body are replaced with new cells, does it still mean that we are the same person? Kane at the end has been replaced with a new Kane which looks like him and sounds like him. Is he still Kane?

>""You're not Kane, are you?""
>""I don't think so. Are you Lena?""

After Lena had faced the alien, she let go of her old self as the duplicate became the one to succumb to self-destruction and stay at the lighthouse holding the grenade. The shimmer seemed to also refract some of the alien DNA into Lena which can explain why her eyes were shimmering at the end. ",7zqsdy
dwmq5ko,"I thought this movie had a lot of potential but once I finally go around to seeing it with a friend last night it was like the movie constantly went out of its way to break suspension of disbelief.

When the 5 women came into the shimmer and lost 3 days worth of time... did they have no journals? did they take no pictures/videos, like, at all?

Once they got inside the shimmer, why wasn't their first objective to leave the shimmer? would they not want to confirm they could come and go as they pleased, or at least try to figure out what was preventing most people from coming back?

Why did a biologist claim that species can't cross-breed? Has she never heard of mules?

When the one girl turned into a tree-person or whatever, where did her clothes go?

There was a lot of small stuff like this that made me feel like the movie was constantly yanking my chain. It would not have been hard to fix these small problems.

There was other stuff that I guess is just par for the course with this genre, like the movie not really having a good resolution, a lot of interesting questions going boringly unanswered (who were these aliens, where did they come from, why were they doing this, etc.), and a lot of smaller plot points that just seemed distracting (the time given to show she was having an affair could have been spent much better).

Unfortunately I gotta say I did not enjoy this movie, at least not for the reasons it was made. By the 45 minute mark my friend and I had definitely decided we would be treating this like a comedy instead of something to take seriously, it was just too much of a joke. We did have a lot of fun laughing at it after that though.

I know there is a lot of hope that Hollywood will put out fresh, original content, and I want the same thing, but this was a swing and a miss for me. Just because something's off the beaten path doesn't make it good, and this movie is an excellent example.

EDIT: I will also add that at one point, probably 75% of the way through the movie, I suggested to my friend that maybe all of this is some kind of psychosis that Natalie's character is experiencing? She agreed that that would explain a lot of the disconnects and nonsensical stuff. By the time Natalie got to the weird hole in the lighthouse I think I had mostly abandoned that theory, at that point it seemed to good to be true, but I still hoped a little bit, because as far as I'm concerned it was the only out I could still conceive of to salvage the story.",7zqsdy

dusjalj,"Some kids parents were fucking dumb asses and reserved half the theater for a small birthday party consisting of 13 year olds. Obviously, they must have been expecting some straight forward scifi horror film, I guess. So my audience was awful and distracting, with them giggling at the sex scenes and practically the whole film. Including the parents. 

Fortunately that fucking bear scene came along and they shut the fuck up. You could practically hear the sound of them collectively shitting their pants. I was also squirming, as the the tension of that sequence was next level. And the sound that thing made was on the level of hearing T.Rex roar for the first time, just totally chilling and unique. Great, great, sound design throughout. 

It also gave me flashbacks to The Ruins with the vines growing beneath the skin (that book also deserves a better adaptation, and I wouldn't mind if Garland did it, actually).

Really strong storytelling here, awesome visuals, genuine frights, only occasional pacing issues but that could just be attributed to me being distracted/pissed at having to sit with my terrible audience.

Will probably see this again though. I just loved the entire second act. I'll definitely be unraveling this for a while. 

Also, though I did like Ex Machina, Annihilation is the better film in my opinion. ",7zqsdy
dusl99v,"While the character development may have lacked in the traditional sense, I think that the character psychologies going into the shimmer beautifully mirrors where they each end up at the end of the film.

For Kane's character, he is extremely important because the reason he goes to the shimmer knowingly on a suicide mission is that he's aware of Lena's affair. He still loves her, but is more dissapointed at himself that he isn't enough for her - tying back to the theme of self hatred/destruction.

Shephard tells Lena her daughter died of Leukemia, and that she had moved on - I think the direct quote was ""two people died the day my daughter died. Her, and also who I was"". I think it's clear that she hasn't moved on. When she gets taken by the bear, Ventress goes through her pack and takes her food. Josie finds a small toy bear attached to her backpack - probably the toy of her daughter, signifying she hasn't let go and this is why she dies - she is unable to move past the death of her daughter and change from it. Its also ironic that she gets killed by the bear.

For Anya Thorenson (Gina Rodriguez's character) - Shephard states that she was once a drug addict. Its why her application for the national guard got ""flagged"" and the southern reach came out to her. She is unable to accept the reality of the shimmer. It distorts everything and she blames it on the trick of the light. She isn't completely rehabilitated from her drug use, so her being inside the shimmer enhances the paranoia and its why she acts kinda crazy and distrustful.

Josie cut herself not to commit suicide, ""but to feel alive"". I really liked how Tessa Thompson portrayed her character, quiet, somber, and always seemingly in thought. The shimmer gave her the ability to feel alive by becoming a part of it.

Ventress was by far my least favorite character, mainly just because of the way her dialogue was delivered. But she truly wanted to know what was at the lighthouse, and she got her answers. She became enveloped in the entity/alien/clone - whatever you wanna call it. And she understood that this entity is here to to merge everything into one and envelop everything as a ""fragment"".

So while the character development was lacking in a traditional sense, the psychology of the characters ties in directly with their fates and imo, is very well thought out and thorough. Hope this might change anyone’s negative opinions on disliking the characters.",7zqsdy
duuawwu,"The climatic scene with the Shimmer Creature and Portman is probably the most terrifying, chilling moment I have ever felt watching a movie. There is something so fundamentally horrifying about being replaced. So much more than just being murdered by another person or mauled by a crocodile/bear. No. Imagine having your identity stolen. Another being lives on in your place, but there is no funeral, no one grieves for you. No one notices you’re actually gone.

dv5kal1,"Here is what I think: This movie is a large metaphor for cancer. The shimmer leads to mutations that change organisms. Each member of the team represents types of mutations that reach certain stages of a possible cancer, and Lena's stage is the one that survives to the final manifestation. However, she was a healthy individual that came out ""mutated."" Cancers like melanoma can stem from existing moles. What represents as Kane's cancer arose in the form of a new organism. Cancers can have multiple forms and many mutated cells never even reach the final stage of an actual tumor manifestation. Our cells have mechanisms that can destroy mutated parts (maybe like how the animals killed off some members) or cells can induce apoptosis and kill themselves to protect the rest of the body.

Dialogue could get a bit janky here and there but I can overlook it for what the movie did right, which they did really really right.

One thing I've noticed people have criticisms of is everyone dying in the shimmer, no one attempts to leave after collecting a bit of data. But I'm not sure if this has been picked up on before, but Ventress, imo, specifically chose people who were prone to suicide or extreme guilt/sadness, and I think she did that as sort of her own psychological experiment and her whole thesis on being self destructive. She knew they weren't coming back, and she chose them because of this which I found interesting.

Also Lena is reading the immortal life of Henrietta Lacks in one scene, which I found very fitting and a nice little nod to anyone who has ever read that book or knows of Henrietta Lacks.

Before I bring this up, I want to state that I absolutely loved ""Annihilation"" and encourage others to see it if they can in theaters. It's a terrific piece of sci-fi horror.

Now that being said, there is one logical hole in the story that popped in my head about half-way through the movie...why the hell did they not approach the lighthouse from the water instead of travelling days across hostile swamp land?

To me it just didn't make any logical sense and they never addressed that question during the film. From the beginning, we're told right away that they're aware that the lighthouse is the source of the Shimmer phenomena and that the overall mission is to reach that location and investigate.

So they sent in several teams into the swamp land and almost no one returned. From a strategic point of view, why wouldn't you simply take the path of least resistance and approach the beach from the water with a boat team? You have a clear 360 degree field of vision, very little to no biological threats to deal with save maybe for what's under the water (take a sturdy boat with a tough engine prop/paddles) and you wouldn't be exposed to the environment nearly as long as you would be travelling on foot in the swamps.

duwno3a,"I loved this film. 

I think a lot of people are assuming it's a film about destruction, but in reality it's just as much a film about creation. Lena no longer exists as she did before. The Lena that left the Shimmer isn't the mimic or herself. It's something entirely new, with experiences and memories that make it unique to any other iteration of Lena.

Consider that this is a film about perspective, and each grouping of cells has its own perspective that is just as ""right"" as any other grouping of cells. There is no correct way to view things, just *your* way.

The shimmer is not a corruption, it is unbiased. Some interpretations of this film seem to think it's unclear or unfinished, but those same people assume the shimmer was the problem to be resolved. The shimmer is the device by which we are delivered Lena's story. A story of love, change, and second chances (or maybe more accurately, second first chances).

Lena is given another opportunity with another Kane. 

Literally, the real-Kane is dead (I assume this because the corpse was burned, not-Kane would have reverted to the metallic looking mimic substance that not-Lena did when she was on fire). However, not-Kane is an exact copy of Kane. Does that make him any less Kane? Depends on your perspective. Yes that Kane is different, but so is real-Lena. Real-Lena goes under transformation through the film as well. The path to that transformation is different (for both of them), but from her perspective it doesn't matter. All that matters is that the grouping of cells (Kane) is the grouping that she loves (or loved). She literally embraces it.

In a much larger sense, nothing really matters, since all perspectives are infinitely biased. I think that realization is causing some people to think that this movie isn't really *saying* anything. To me, that's the most profound thing it could say.",7zqsdy

The theme I liked the best was the repeated reference to cell death, suicide, and self destruction.
-the “damaged goods” mindset of the team
-the physicst’s past of attempted suicide
-the biologist’s speech at the beginning of the film about programmed death
-the husband’s suicide
-the acceptance of moving on by the physicist
-the death of the being in the lighthouse
-the “death” of Area X at the hands of the the being in the lighthouse (after not-Kane has escaped)
-the self destruction of the biologist’s marriage
-I don’t know, probably more things

The deaths of the surveyor and the EMT also fit in, just less notably than the rest.

It almost seemed to me like Area X intended to or was programmed to cease (like cells do after they have outlived their usefulness).

I think the themes are amazing in this movie and this one stuck out to me because it seemed to have no ill intent or even volition. Just a program following instructions.

dv7alpt,"I have a loose theory that Kane wanted his higher intelligent counterpart to continue on as himself, so he destroyed himself. Perhaps as a negotiation premise that he (his alien clone) could procreate with his wife lena. Lena then does the same after her encounter with the lighthouse being (s).  The shimmer field then, having served it's initial purpose of seeking out the most advanced lifeform (human) to intertwine and procreate with, dissolves purposefully (god doesn't make mistakes).  Lena's clone survives and lies about the way she killed the shimmer. After her interrogation, Lena (actually the alien mutation) makes her way back to kane' s clone where they talk and embrace (both of their eyes shimmer). Likely now to procreate and spread the alien mutation in a more stealth manner. 

Another thing that really struck me about the theme, especially right before kane blew himself up was interconnectedness. That he was you, and you are him. Everything is one. It's interesting because many theories of physics depict the universe and everything in it as one fabric. The mutation is a mirror of this idea. The alien becomes everything and singular things as it chooses. A shapeshifting, all encompassing, all knowing being. It becomes a combination of all who enter it.

To me, the dialogue between Lena and her physician college is the most important one to understand what's going on in this movie. This whole alien-thing, as an organism, kind of irritates me and also the multiple discussions below regarding cancer-like behaviour of the ET kind of overshoot the situation.

In the dialogue the physicist pointed out, that the shimmer doesn't block the radio frequencies but disturb them. The same happens to the light frequencies. Therefore it's called shimmer. Inside the light gets split up in its spectral components (Through the whole movie one sees that rainbow filter on the world). Therefore I would see the ET first of all is not as an organic organism but maybe as a kind of device(?) or interaction shell that functions as a prism, not only for light, but for amino acid structure or genetic information/frequencies. The ET does not spread and try to evolve itself inside the hosts, but just is. And by this, splits the genetic information of all living being in its interaction area in the basic elements (blue, green, red, ..., skin, limbs, wood, roots, ...). The trouble starts when there is more than one living organism: the basic genetic information elements then form a kind of superposition in some 'higher dimensional genetic-space'. Those superpositions manifest themselves in the world in form of what the movie presented: the mixed flowers, the alligator, the human-shaped trees, the bear, the roots coming out of the arms of the physicist etc. So even the organism in the light house was just the psychologist in the strongest superposition possible with the ET itself (?, and also the movie needed some kind of entity for Lena to interact with). Additional, I think: If the shimmer would have been taken place on the moon there one lonely astronaut would have been. Nothing would have happened to him, because there are no other living organism within reach to interact/superposit.

What do you think about that approach?",7zqsdy
dvlogmn,"Regardless of the movie, if you enjoyed the mystery setting inside the shimmer and want to see another take on it, please read the books (at least the first one)!

dvmdeki,"I watched the movie last night, absolutely love flicks like this and Arrival. I really should read the books they're based on. I particularly loved the effects, cinematography and performances. The bear in particular was so well made when we got to see it in detail. That was one of the most chilling scenes I've watched in forever.

I have a few questions that might spark some discussion

Why wasn't Lena effected by the environment as the others were? Is it because she wanted to push on and make it out alive?

The bear used Shepard's scream to lure them out, but as they asked did her mind become part of the bear? Is she reliving that moment of her life over and over? Or did it just take her voice?

Why did Josie give up? Was she brainwashed by the shimmer or had she just seen enough of losing those around her?

and the ending: So, at what point was Lena no longer herself? Was it when she was hypnotised, when she was KO'D? We saw that the entity can play mind games, warp itself, can be capable of violence as well as changing the environment

What impressed me was the way the visuals combined beauty and horror - and how that reflected one of the themes of the whole movie, the beauty and horror of creation, how creation is predicated on destruction, and the allure of destruction. 

The bear, the flower people, the crystalline beach and the green doppelganger-dance will all stay with me for a long time. I really wish Jennifer Jason Leigh had just died without us seeing how, I thought that would have been really ballsy if Natalie Portman had come to on the beach, completely alone with no explanation. The music towards the end was good and very 'Under the Skin'-nish - as were the visuals, actually.

The ending (glimmering eyes over the shoulder) was so cliched, didn't think it needed that. Also, as I'm sure others have pointed out, I don't know why Oscar Isaac's character wouldn't have burned up with the rest of the 'shimmer'?

dv97n7k,"I've been trying to expand my analysis of the movie through a Jungian lens. I've been at it for a week, roughly. Here's something I've refined over the week.  This includes the analysis of the second act, The Shimmer. Links to some of my thoughts on The Lighthouse and other smatterings of thoughts are linked at the end, if you're interested. Thanks for reading, if you do.

Carl Jung once wrote, ""Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual's conscious life, the blacker and denser it is (""Psychology and Religion"").""

""It may be (in part) one's link to more primitive animal instincts, which are superseded during early childhood by the conscious mind (""Answer to Job"").""

[As it so happens, animals play an important role in this movie, to say the least. In Jung's model of personality development, the ""animal instinct"" is supposed to be ""superseded"" in ""early childhood development."" So, insofar as entering the area inside the shimmer marks the beginning of the individuation process, then dying to the ""animal instinct"" is an utter failure; it is the failure to recognize the importance of the journey, it's true significance. Cass and Anya die, respectively, unconscious of, and psychologically projecting, the dark substances of their own personalities that they've brought into this dreamscape.](#spoiler)

[It's appropriate then that the movie starts off this dramatic telling of Jung's individuation process with a pre-eminent example of someone who's conquered their animal instinct--in ultimate contrast to the other three characters--namely, Lena. In a big movie moment just after the team wakes up within the shimmer, they encounter a mutant crocodile. Since we're applying a Jungian lens, I think we can get away with abstracting the crocodile (and bear for that matter) to represent the ""animal instinct"" itself. It's that thing that lurks under the water's surface, in the deep, unseen, emerging without warning, below the surface of the consciousness, the predator, the hunter, the aggressive nature. And Lena kills it, in rather impressive fashion. She confronts it with her brow pursed, indicating intense focus, and brings that focus to bear on the animal in order to defeat it; she drops *forward* to one knee, toward the danger--she has a well integrated aggression, a well-integrated animal instinct. You could say she's more of an animal than the crocodile, but, at the same time is in complete control of herself (this would be a virtue for Jung). Additionally, the slow motion camera work cues the audience to slow themselves down as well, to consider what's being displayed on screen, i.e. Lena's well-rounded personality. This scene serves as the thesis statement, so to speak, as this moment highlights the differences between Lena and each of the characters who never make it to the lighthouse. (Some have criticized that many of **the characters were poorly developed**. They're absolutely correct).](#spoiler)

[Of the death's in the movie, Cass's bothered me the most. She dies in the dark; she cannot see what it is that kills her; worse, she can't see **anything**; before she knows what's happening, she's carried off by ""something;"" And, perhaps worst of all, she dies because of her decision, perhaps her subconscious desire, to stray from the ""light"" of the ""guardpost."" It's a classic archetypal mistake. When we emerged as homo sapiens and mastered fire, you *did not* stray from the campfire when it was dark and there were threats outside the light. We grew with that basic tenet evolutionarily selected for, for a long time. It speaks heavily to Cass's state of mind, she has lost her basic animal instinct. As she said herself, she was one of ""two bereavements,"" when her daughter died. She was a walking dead woman, and was simply looking for something to finish to job. (Now, why in the hell you set up your damn ""guard post"" on ground level is another psychological issue in and of itself. Jesus. There's a self-imposed blindness going on here that, by no coincidence, Ventress and Lena just got done talking about--""self destruction vs. suicide."")](#spoiler)

[Anya's failure is uglier than Cass's for reasons I think most of us can feel. She is someone who projects. Jung, in his ""Phenomenology of the Self,"" wrote, ""...the shadow, in being instinctive and irrational, is prone to psychological projection, in which a perceived personal inferiority is recognized as a perceived moral deficiency in someone else."" If these projections remain hidden, ""The projection-making factor (the Shadow archetype) then has a free hand and can realize its object—if it has one—or bring about some other situation characteristic of its power."" This begins after Anya watches the first footage that they find. She immediately projects, ""So **they all went insane** and killed each other."" Then she tries to write it off as a ""trick of the light."" And in a last desperate attempt to write it off as unreal, she appeals to her Jungian **persona**--the superficial public identity with whom you are not supposed to identify completely, according to Jung--as an ""experienced paramedic"" who's ""seen some weird shit,"" and so she *knows* what's possible and impossible. She's a classic case. Again, however, it's worse than that. I wrote a bit about Kane's first glimpse ""inside"" another man, and his relieved expression.](#spoiler)

I'll link that here: https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7zqsdy/official_discussion_annihilation_spoilers/dv6zor5/

[Once you understand *what* Anya was calling a ""trick of the light,"" the rest is easy to understand and fit into the Jungian framework, i.e. calling Lena a ""lying bitch,"" when Anya herself has been lying about the fundamentally important meaning of the journey, and has, fundamentally speaking again, been the *real* bitch. And insane.](#spoiler)

[As for Josie, I think she's basically lucky, in the sense that she survives things she ought to have died to--that she **deserves** to die to, if we're looking at decisions and consequences. In the run in with the crocodile, she's the one who goes into the shack and reports back when asked by Ventress, *the psychologist*, whether there was anything *inside*. When a psychologist asks you if anything is inside, think about it for a second. Josie immediately responds, to paraphrase, ""Nope, looks empty."" **Think again**. The house is half submerged. Looking at it logistically, not even metaphorically, what constitutes ""inside"" the house also includes everything underwater. And we've already gone over what ""underwater"" means, and what lurks there, archetypally. Josie did not really *look*. Yet she tried to make a truth claim about it's emptiness when she was not qualified to make any claim about what was ""inside"" the house. And the consequences of her decision snap back at her immediately, as if to prove her wrong. Josie yells, as she's being dragged under the surface, ""It's got my bag!"" The animal instinct has got a hold of her by her ""baggage,"" and is pulling her into the depths. But again, she's lucky. Lena saves her. Josie departs from that scene a little wiser, more aware of what it means to be in the shimmer, what it means to be dragged ""under the water"", and is a little more experienced with the animal instinct.](#spoiler)

[Fast forward to the bear scene. Who is the one that kills the bear? Josie! But, in a very particular way; different from how Lena killed the crocodile. Josie kills the bear in a sneaky, cowardly, from-the-side, in terror, incomplete kind of way, as the animal instinct is trained on someone else. Again, luck. And guess what? Luck isn't sufficient for someone to complete the journey to the Shadow. Jung emphasized that it should be a mantle taken up, not lightly, and not unwittingly, but with determination, grit, and high awareness. I think in the garden, Josie understands this, and in her talk with Lena, she's quite astute. She notes how Ventress wants ""to face"" (Ventress literally does ""face"") the Shadow, and Lena wants ""to fight"" it. Josie runs away.](#spoiler)

Here we get another act transition, the screen switches to black, ""The Lighthouse"" appears, and we're thrown out of time and location with a crying Lena who doesn't recognize where she is, and the final act initiates.

Just to throw in a little blurb about the time skips, regardless of how the book explains them, they strike me as a literary technique to suggest a dreamscape. Dreams and dream interpretation were very important to the depth psychologists like Freud and Jung. Dreams are temporally non-linear, with seemingly random fragmented sequences of events. Wong's character states explicitly that Lena's journey sounded ""dreamlike,"" and that it must've been ""nightmarish."" Lena agrees and disagrees, she says that it was ""beautiful"" at times, also. I think Jung would take her side. The archetypal dream is both nightmarish and blissful. 

INB4 it was all a dream. 

TL;DR It was not.

I've written some thoughts on the third act and tried my best to layout Jung's phase of individuation he called ""the appearance of, the encounter with, the merger with, and the assimilation of, the Shadow."" I'll link them here:

[The bear didn't eat Shepherd. It ate her throat and then left pretty much the entire body untouched.

Maybe the bear doesn't actually need to eat, and it's just running on the instinct that it needs to hunt?

dv5msi4,"I think the alien is absolutely without intent, positive or negative. 
It just does what it does. It refracts time and DNA and a bunch of other stuff. Some of what it does is horrific to our human perspective, some of it is beautiful and strange. But it has no intention to be either of horrific or strange. It is simply a different force acting on our planet. 

Did anyone notice that the base of the hole in the lighthouse had many different doors? And that at the beginning when Kane shows up and surprises Lena, he said he just saw an open door and he saw her in it and he recognized her? Possible those other doors lead to different timelines?

dw1a4qh,"I was psyched to see it, but found myself kinda put off in the end. Wasn't a big fan of the acting and some of the dialogue choices in general, and while i thought he premise was a great idea i found the themes unfocused. There seemed to be this battled inside of the movie between it wanting to be a green Aesop (humans bad, nature/change good), a cosmic horror theme (no one is good or bad, nothing means anything, ur weak and all fucked), and a humanity f-yeah story (we did it, we saved earth from Space Cancer!).

So though i feel like it a had a lot of interesting statements inside of those specific themes (like the human capacity for self destruction for the green aesop, the general amorality/meaninglessness of the shimmer in the cosmic horror, and the rejection of futility and the fuck yeah that comes with Lena destroying the shimmer), when everything is put together you get this disjointed mess.

Great sci-fi always ask a question and focuses on trying to answer it: 2001 asked ""where are we going as a species"", Bladerunner asked ""what does it mean to be human"", and The Man Who Fell to Earth ask ""why is it so easy to fall into weakness?"". 

Annihilation doesn't really ask a driving question, it just kinda creates plot device that acts as a grab bag it can use to pull an assortment of ideas/statements from.

The biggest ""omg, wtf"" moment for me was when she set her glass down at the end.

Fast forward to the end of the movie. She grabs the glass of water, drinks it, sets it down. No blood. We are good right? Wrong. It was at that moment that I freaked out. Looking for blood was quite literally a red herring. What you'll notice with the glass of water is that her hand is pointing the opposite way!!!! The reflection is wrong. That is the point when I realized she was the alien and she lied about her escape.

Think about what she and the hazmat suit guy were talking about. The alien was ""mirroring her"". The reflection of her hand in the glass of water was the wrong way. It was a ""mirror"" opposite. Blew my f'ing mind. I was in my seat freaking out lol",7zqsdy

duzbzsl,"I saw this movie a few days ago, and this might be an unpopular opinion but I don't think this movie was as good as it should have been.

The film used the framing device of Lena's debrief in the quarantine and the flashbacks to her problems with Kane as a way to explain her deteriorating mental faculties due to the shimmer. However, it could have been done so much better than how they did it in the movie. 

A good example of this in the movie was when the group first went into the shimmer, and the next scene Lena was waking up in a tent. As a movie goer, I was thinking ""When did she pitch the tent? What happened?"" Which is exactly how the characters in the film reacted to that scene. I thought that this was going to set up clever uses of editing and film making where the characters in the film experience madness in a similar way to how it was portrayed on the screen, almost like breaking the fourth wall but not exactly, but instead it seemed as though the debriefing scenes and the flashbacks just happened randomly.

I think that a better editing technique they could have done in the film would have been for the flashbacks to start after Lena entered the shimmer, and intensified over the course of the movie to the point that the audience isn't sure when she is having a flashback. That way the audience experiences her descent into madness vicariously. I'm pretty sure they used flashbacks before the entrance to the shimmer, and I think that was a story telling mistake.

Apart from that, I liked the setting and the monsters in the shimmer, as well as the set up of the alien as something beyond understanding. I thought that the group dynamic was interesting, and some of the designs (like the pool body) made my stomach turn, which was good. I am more enthusiastic about the movie than disappointed, but I still think it should have been better.

dv6ez6y,"At a certain point Lena stops the cheating. She says ""this is a mistake."" She wants to end the self-destructive behavior. 

So even though she is changed by the shimmer (gains a tattoo from Reya, her blood is different, etc) she is able to leave successfully because she is willing to face her self-destructiveness and, apparently, end it (aka blow it up). 

Lena is absolutely different at the end. She's not the original Lena. She's not the clone. This question of whether she's the original or the clone is irrelevant. She is evolved. She has faced the living form of her own self-destruction and now her entire self has changed; she's someone and/or something different. Her eyes GLOW! 

What if all of us faced our self-destructive tendencies? What if we examined where these tendencies came from? Did we inherit them from Mom and Dad? Were they learned? Developed? Are they responses? What if we fearlessly faced our shadow selves and then burned them with the light of awareness. (Anyone consider the phosphorescent grenade is literally an explosion of light? AKA consciousness? )

These types of sci-fi films - the kind that delve into the unknown and the protagonist's mind all while mixing feelings of wonder, beauty, mystery, terror, and so on - are my favorites. So I'm biased. And we get them so rarely (well, good ones), so I'm a bit starved. But I really loved it. The dialogue felt a little clunky at times. But aside from that I felt it was pretty solid. I thought the characters made some strange decisions but as the film wore on it became apparent they were just losing their shit. Which was kind of terrifying to watch.    

The bear scene was the definition of nightmare fuel. You take this awful scenario of the characters tied up in fear of being gutted by this girl who is losing it. Then it escalates with this terrifying creature and haunting sound effects. Then it climaxes with fucking brutal gore. Holy shit. What a scene.  

The visual motifs were beautiful. That iridescent effect that kept popping up here and there, and the lush, psychedelic set designs. Couple that with the nonlinear editing and the whole journey amounted to a real mindfuck. There were a few moments where I couldn't help but be reminded of 'Sunshine,' Which Garland wrote but didn't direct. It played with this idea of transcendence and characters either resisting it or embracing it, like when Radek vanished. Not just thematically but visually too: That burning ring of fire, the way Ventress disintegrated into some sort of plasma, and the hypnotic blob that Lena stared into.  

I was hoping for a bigger reveal in the final scene but was still satisfied with the implications of the last shot. All in all a really thrilling and evocative sci-fi thriller. Reminded me somewhat of Solaris. Which reminds me I need to stop what I'm doing and finally watch Stalker.

First off, my science fiction half is satisfied, which is a rarity these days. It explored some really interesting ideas - a God gene of sorts existing in a refracted world. Everything influences and effects each other resulting in a mutation of beautiful and terrifying hybrid life forms. I felt it had parallels to our modern society of overdevelopment and footprint on the environment. We are changing our world in ways we can't imagine, the evolution is both beautiful and terrible. It was an appropriate amount of science without being too heavy. 
The horror side of me was fairly satisfied. Some absolute terrifying imagery. I do wish it was more suspenseful. The moment with the bear felt both strong but also cliched. They executed something well enough, but it's something I've seen a million times before.

I just simply didn't care enough about the characters or their motives to feel the impact of their actions. The story very well could've been told without Oscar Isaac and the actions of Lena would've been nearly just as justified. I didn't feel the gravity of his insecurity or Lena's desire to find out, for me, it didn't feel like the motivating factor for trying to get to the lighthouse. It actually made me appreciate the subplot in Arrival significantly more. 
The supporting characters were also less interesting than I was hoping. Their impact on the propulsion of the story seemed half-baked. The tension of the team probably could've used one more scene to build the distrust. In fact, I feel the movie could've used a few more scenes of character development to make the payoff feel greater. I thought the supporting casts acting was mediocre.

Because, ugh, the Lighthouse scene was both incredible and underwhelming. It was beautiful visually and sonically. But it lacked the impact it could've had if the characters were a bit more likeable. That's a personal preference however, and it seems that a lot of people did enjoy the Kane/Lena subplot enough that the conclusion paid off. 

Now on this scene as well, it's also very abstract. Abstractions can be great, but they're also very personal. It either hits emotionally, or it doesn't. I appreciated what they were trying to do and there were moments where I was like ""YES"" but in the end it didn't fulfil the potential it could've.

And that's how I feel about the movie in its entirety. There were some fantastic moments, I have a ton of respect for it, but in the end the human element has to be the most important part of any film and it lacked that.

I will see it again, especially after reading so many comments regarding stuff that I felt I missed or have forgotten. 

I do recommend, particularly if you like sci-fi.

duslvc0,"Because I'm a huge fan of the game, there is something that I immediately noticed during the scene where Ventress discovers the pool with the overgrown body. I won't spoil anything for the game, but The Last of Us features something very similar. The enemies in the game are the infected, these zombie-like creatures infected by a cordyceps virus. The infected go through different stages of disease, each one progressively worse and more fungal, until the creature finally finds a place to die. When it does, it spreads the virus as much as it can, [which looks something along the lines of this.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/thelastofus/images/6/62/Spore_subway.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160624124755) Notice the body, with a fragmented skull (a key feature of the game's infected) and the growth around it.

Right away I saw a similiarity between the infected in The Last of Us and that poor fellow in the pool. I'm fairly confident that Garland took some inspiration from the artists at Naughty Dog because of [this interview with PlayStation Blog](https://blog.us.playstation.com/2018/02/13/alex-garlands-favorite-games-are-the-last-of-us-and-bioshock/) where he says one of his favourite games is The Last of Us.

But the one thing, and maybe I'm wrong about this, is that the first dead body they encounter, the one in the pool that had mutated, had a torso growing out of the wall about 10 feet up.

dv7b6wl,"[I have a theory that the characters we are following are not really the same ones that entered the Shimmer.
We know that the Shimmer can recreate life, and we know that the ""clones"" (although this isn't really the right word), don't have memories of being alive prior to the moment they are cloned. 
The next scene after the team enters the Shimmer shows the team  members stumbling to recall how they go there or how long they've been in the Shimmer.
We also know that life created in the Shimmer becomes a mix of all the other lifeforms in the shimmer already. 
There is also a comment during the integration scene that the team entering the Shimmer did not have enough provisions to last as long as they appeared to be in the Shimmer.
I believe the team we see enter the Shimmer probably dies at some point, and the team we are watching in the movie is a recreation of that original team. In fact, it is possible that we are watching multiple versions of that recreated team (although it does appear that there is sufficient continuity on the team once they are in the Shimmer). This could explain why the tattoo appears to jump from person to person, as the tattoo is becoming a part of the clone when the new clone is being created. 
This also might explain why both Lena and her husband's eyes' appear to glow the end of the film. They are both ""clones"" already. ](#spoiler)",7zqsdy
dv84akj,"Crazy idea, probably doesn't work, but what if Kane isn't a clone. What if the clone killed itself because it couldn't deal with self-awareness. Instead of a straight clone, the duplicates are just a manifestation of a part of that person, like cells dividing. The Kane that died was the part of Kane that was too insecure to confront his wife about her affair. The Kane that returns isn't missing memories, at least not by the end of the film. He's just confused and aloof because he can't make sense of his experience.

By extension, this means that the final scene wasn't Lena fighting a clone or a mimic, but her own dark side. There is something unmistakably sexual (rapey even) about that final confrontation. I think this is a refraction of her sexual promiscuity. Lena can't control her dark side. But she realizes her dark side is just as weak and fallible as she is. When she hands the grenade to the clone the clone reaches for her hand knowingly. When the grenade goes off the clone let's Lena go and proceeds to self-destruct. Where Lena found the intense desire to survive she passed on her self-destruction to the clone and it behaved on that impulse.",7zqsdy

the ""real"" lena survives and makes it out. She has obviously been changed by the shimmer. The shimmer refracts everything, not just DNA.

Meanwhile her copy was more like the entity trying to recreate her, which version of her? im not sure, but i think the one that she was before she went in the shimmer. the longer it copied her the more it was like her. (I think even memories are refracted in the shimmer, and thats why copy kane recognized lena).

In the end, if her copy stayed with her long enough and if Lena stayed in there even longer, i think the copy could have been more like the ""original"" Lena than what original Lena would turn into.

dvx6ivi,"I initially thought that that creature had developed its horrifying scream as a sort of psuedo-evolutionary lure to attract empathetic humans towards it. I thought it was adapting as a predator.
The reason given in the film was far more chilling, once I grasped the films themes it made far more sense of course too.

This scene made me think about an actual theory concerning the relationship between the physical world and consciousness. That being; the idea that consciousness might emerge from a particular atomic structure or pattern, giving consciousness a correspondence to physical properties, while also being something that can obviously be subjectively experienced.

I'm wondering if anyone has any theories on how her consciousness is 'transmitted' so to speak, into this creature. That's what seems to implied by the film. Did this ""transmission"" only go in one direction like screaming girl to creature, or in both directions like Portman and the iridescent form in the lighthouse (she seemed to acquire knowledge of the forms intentions and certain traits were transmitted back). This seems to have happened with other characters who interacted with the lighthouse thing too no? But the creature  in the house was a subject of the shimmer much like the humans, how did it obtain said consciousness without powers? 

I assumed that it had something to do with the shimmers refraction. Refraction refers to waves changing direction due to them passing obliquely through the threshold betweem two mediums, and as far as quantum and particle physics is concerned, everything is in someway reducible to waveform (correct if wrong, not a scientist). It's interesting to consider that neural oscillations are waves and they might be able to represent a refraction of consciousness... but if the cause was the shimmer then surely all consioussness within it would be merging in some way together, something unintelligible to us i'd imagine but certainly different to what occurred in the film. 

Maybe i'm asking dumb questions and coming up with my own convoluted rstionalisations in response; but I can't explain some aspects of the film past the incredible cinematic affect they have on the viewer. I was hoping there was some kind of of foundation based in theoretical physics that really makes strengthens science part of the sci-fi. The fiction part is already there, best scene was with the creature for me, scary as fuck.

dwqmo2k,"My current thoughts so far. 

The base of this is that the alien's goal is primarily to create a new improved race of humans. Maybe one without any flaws in genes. 

The psychologist was somehow already a duplicate/mutant. She talked plainly, had no family known of, etc. 

Psychologist wanted to get a male and female mutant to begin breeding new species. This is why they have the quote about no 2 species being able to cross. 

In the lighthouse a person is blended with an alien so that they each hold part of the other. This is why at the end Lena and Kane are both mutated. 

I think what ultimately happens is that the alien has done it's job, and burns down everything in conclusion. Kane and Lena will be genetically advanced/perfect and will pass that down into the world. 

With that, humans would become a sort of cancer on the Earth as they blot out everything else. Though we already do that.

The first act felt very flat to me.  Not much tension, character development was kind of formulaic.  I was feeling like the movie might be a disappointment at this point.  It really picked up once the first bear attack happens though (the one where you can't really see the bear).  It's a truly great movie from that point forward.

I wasn't a big fan of jumping between timelines.  Every time it cut back to her debriefing or to her husband, I was immediately annoyed and wanted to get back to the action.

 Ventress and Portman talked about the difference between suicide and self destruction and talked about marriage being one thing one could self destruct and Portman gets defensive here, I dont think the affair has been revealed yet if I remember right. I liked the misdirection here where we are supposed to think the self destruction to their marriage is from Oscar Isaac always being away on missions and their inability to communicate until her infidelity is revealed. At the beginning Kaine’s (Oscar isaac’s) flat affect is from the dissociation he feels being part kaine and part alien biology, but it could also be the flat affect of an emotionally unavailable partner or someone depressed because their wife was cheating on them. The characters suddenly waking up having been in the shimmer for days reminded me of how in a moment of crisis in our lives or relationships we often think how did this happen or how did we get here, even though it arrived incrementally it feels very sudden and you can realize “actually this distance between us isn’t sudden and has been here for some time”, or “this drinking problem isn’t sudden if I’m honest”. 

I also noted ventress saying she wanted to hurry to the light house or else “the person who finishes this trip won’t be the person who started it”, and thought about how much this applies to life itself and relationships and that really it’s impossible not to change - both literally and figuratively as our cells divide and die and as we are affected by relationships and events in our lives. At the end both Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac’s characters were somewhat who they were before her infidelity and are somewhat changed by it.

One thing that I noticed was the fact that a lot of the destruction that was going on in the movie (the bear, the motile intestines) was horrifying. Realistically destruction plays a huge part in evolution and creation... in order for an organism to thrive it often comes at the cost of another organism. In this case it is the shimmer that is evolving at the cost of every living organism on Earth. The result is every organism struggling to survive and trying to deal with their declining condition (the bear, the crocodile, every character). Because of our human condition we see our struggle to survive as disturbing and horrifying when in reality it is just how evolution works.

With that said those bear screams have somehow set up camp in a part of my brain and that memory isn't leaving anytime soon... ",7zqsdy

It feels as though there was a magnificently missed opportunity to show the beauty of the shimmer world as compared to the grotesque aspects of nature showcased in with the animal attacks/gore results and with a much longer allotted time frame. I feel as though I could have justified the extensive gore if the effort to show a transformation of pure beauty and nature in mutation was better expressed. Aside from showing the end mutation of the soldier from the SD card, there was little given to the other side of the spectrum.  All in all, I found myself completely entranced by the film and could go into far deeper discussions, the Lighthouse Chapter alone deserves a plethora of analysis, but for the moment, I need to forgive this lack of attention.

It drew you in without really giving you a solid idea of what to expect, which I think is the perfect trailer for this type of movie. The final trailer though, god it was terrible. Gave away most of the pivotal scenes, the tone was completely wrong, hell it even showed the freakin alien. Too much shooting and screaming and actiony bits. I think if they had stuck with something more like the first trailer and presented it as more of a psychological thriller/horror instead of a straight up sci-fi, it would've been received better.

dv7cbiz,"Haven't seen this movie yet, just read the book. It was pretty clear to me at the end of the book that Annihilation is on a direct lineage from Lovecraft - where Lovecraft was writing horror in a Modernist setting where the fear that there are things which cannot be known is the ultimate fear, in Annihilation the book, written in a Postmodern era, the fear is that there may be things not knowable at all, by anyone, because they have no ontology. The prism that is the shimmer is the massive metaphor of rational science attempting to understand a universe that ultimately, at some level, is different depending on the observer, and therefore irrational and unknowable. This is the ultimate horror for modern people - the idea that the science we so resolutely rely on, in the faith that the universe must certainly be as deterministic as we hope it is everywhere and not just locally, could ultimately prove just as useless in the face of reality as our old superstitions, leaving us alone with our nightmares and absolutely nothing to tell us they are not exactly what our minds are telling us they are.",7zqsdy

I'm beginning to wonder if the stages of grief are also represented in each of the characters.

dvndjnx,"Seems kind of divisive here but I loved this movie. I have not read the books but now i'm interested to get the full story. 

There were little clues dotted through the movie as to what was going on. At the dinner table, the camera really focuses on the glass of water. It wasn't a reflection but a refraction, so that was some cool foreshadowing. The infinity tattoo was also very interesting as it visually represents the immortal cell division Lena was talking about earlier in the movie. The tattoo also moved from person to person showing that their dna was changing and mixing by folding in upon itself to create something new. 

Maybe the movie isn't perfect and it doesn't follow the source material exactly but it is very thought provoking. Some of the comments here seem obnoxiously obtuse on purpose, like they didn't even bother to pay attention and then blame the movie. It's not pretentious to put a little thought into what you are watching. Then again I'm seeing comments telling people to ""go watch the Marvel movies if you can't understand this one"".

I firmly believe you can't just retell the first book as it exists through the biologist's inner monologue and a masterful finish of the last 30 pages that are very hard to translate to film. So I embraced all the creative changes Garland applied to the film. Absolutely loved the look, atmosphere and sound design. The only elements that I found annoying and dissapointed it was missing: The swearing paramedic knuckle head was really annoying - these are supposed to be very clever people. The prominence of technology (automatic weapons and everyone has one, video cameras with super batteries) kind of destroy one of the key characteristics of Area X. Also the suggested ""conclusion"" at the end where the alien life form gets destroyed and the new Adam and Eve version leaves the perimeter. It would have been nice to highlight the hypnosis element more and use the original purpose that led to the title name. I would have liked the film even more if Garland would have told the story of one the many unknown expeditions without trying to stretch the 12th, but it all worked in the end.

dxpkd8j,"I think this film explored some pretty interesting themes and topics, but faltered when it came to actually getting into the nitty-gritty. It overstated a lot, made a lot of broad, sweeping judgements, was too explicit. I felt sometimes that it swelled convincingly and encouragingly to a certain point, but popped its own bubble with expositional dialogue. It didn’t help that the science wasn’t convincing. It felt too anchored in our world’s science, and that coupled with it being voiced by the characters was a bit jarring; the proposals made felt very general, non-individual, and particularly non-speculative. 

It still left a mark and I’ll probably think of it often over the next few days. I could say more, but eh.",7zqsdy

Bear scene was the most frightening thing I've seen in a long time. Literally omg'd. The horror was on fucking point. The stomach body horror was... gross. I loved it. Gorgeous visuals. Haunting images. The plants that grew with human coded DNA was actually really disturbing. It actually reminded me of ""The Ruins"" a lot. So so movie, great book, has evil plants that replicate voices too.

Thoughtful themes of self destruction and mitosis and evolution. I can't really put it into words but it's so dense, every single frame... Jk. 

Characters were solid. Lena's character was good, her backstory of her affair was a little on the nose but I liked it. I actually really liked Jennifer Jason Leigh's character a lot, stoic and crazy. She kinda reminded me of Searle from Garland's other screenplay ""Sunshine.""

[I think the shimmer (or the alien) is similar to mutated cells, like cancers or tumors. The shimmer isn't malignant but not benign either, it's creating new things, by assimilating itself with lives on Earth. What the shimmer wants is to survive, so it needs to *evolve*. As Carl Sagan said, mutation is what makes evolution possible. Through evolution, a live can adapt.﻿](#spoiler)

2. If Kane was the clone (which seems to be the case) and he was severely ill when exiting the shimmer, it can be assumed that living outside his world would be detrimental to his health. However when the shimmer collapsed (was burnt to ash) he revived, why?

3. Some have been arguing that clone Kane, perhaps Lena too, were going to restart the shimmer. My belief is that they are merely embracing over their shared bond and experience, and perhaps the shimmer is gone forever.

duy1ddl,"At the end when Lena reunited with the cloned Kane both of their eyes light up in a way that insinuates they are both of the same origin. When the cloned version of Lena and Kane reunite at the end this is a subtle way of telling us the “cancer” has metastasized and evolved to survive outside of the shimmer and now a male and female surrogate of the “cancer” survive outside of the shimmer environment that it previously could only survive inside of. Opening up the possibility to spread the “cancer” outside of the shimmer.

This is hard to grasp because it appears that the “Real Lena” survived the shimmer...so why do her eyes light up in the same way as the clone of Kane? That’s because the clone continued to mimic Lena when she led the clone to self destruct.  The theme of self destruction has been discussed multiple times. I think that Lena believes she is outsmarting the clone when she places the grenade in its hand. Prior to this event Lena makes physical contact with the clone multiple times without the clone taking on her exact physical appearance. It’s not until Lena places the grenade in the clones hand that the clone takes on her exact physical appearance.  The viewer believes that Lena outsmarted the clone into destroying itself by crawling to the core and igniting the light house. However the clone did what it only knows how to do....mimic. The clone touched her and destroyed the real Lena. Leaving only a clones version of Lena to go out into the real world that it previously could not survive in and further spread the cancer with her previously infected partner Kane. The physics of earth would not allow the cancer to spread as rapidly as it could in the environment of the shimmer. Now there is a male and female “infected” that can replicate the virus through traditional sexual interaction.



",7zqsdy
duy3n47,"I like to think of the movie as mutation isn't always successful, and evolution (after a long time) ultimately results in eradication of a species or a species adapting to a change. There are theories that suggest that our own ancestral DNA has either been corrupted by DNA from viruses/bacteria or our DNA hijacked useful bits of information from viruses/bacteria (i.e. mitochondria).

For all of the women that went in, there was some degree of self destruction, and as Lena said in the beginning, their DNA was imperfect, flaws would eventually cause failure- Yet a lot of the focus remained on their mental imperfections.

The thing is... I think the corrupted Lena that came out was actually better than the Lena that went in. The mindless alien organism continued to mix and match DNA at random, which led to crazy results, but finally with Lena there was an adaptation success, and though I haven't fully fleshed (lol) out this idea yet I think it had something to do with either her guilt or love for Kane, which created a desire to survive (she even suggests this in the movie). The corrupted Lena also managed to destroy her clone, suggesting one adaptation being stronger than the other even if they share a common ancestor.

In the end the corrupted Lena had no sense of self destruction or guilt, and didn't even lie but instead told the truth without question, and obviously very much loved Kane. The Kane clone also loved her back, as evidence by the hug despite admitting he wasn't Kane. So basically, on a purely mental level, everything negative in her psyche was eradicated but love remained to produce a successful adaptation so much that the two corrupted people were in fact better equipped emotionally than actual humans... Which suggests an eventual replacement of the less equipped species due to competition and survival of the fittest- Assuming actual humans are even aware of the fact that they are gradual being outdone by another species.",7zqsdy

>The echo of a distant tide comes willowing across the sand

>And everything is green and submarine

>And no one showed us to the land

>And no one knows the where's or why's

>But something stirs and something tries

>Starts to climb towards the light

>Strangers passing in the street

>By chance two separate glances meet

>And I am you and what I see is me

>And do I take you by the hand

>And lead you through the land

>And help me understand the best I can?

>And no one calls us to move on

>And no one forces down our eyes

>No one speaks and no one tries

>No one flies around the sun




>Cloudless every day you fall

>Upon my waking eyes

>Inviting and inciting me to rise

>And through the window in the wall

>Come streaming in on sunlight wings

>A million bright ambassadors of morning





>And no one sings me lullabies

>And no one makes me close my eyes

>So I throw the windows wide

>And call to you across the sky

The end of the song fits with what happened to those taken over by it, they disassociated so far from themselves that they became one with the world around them moving through it like light.

It seems the experimenter was already betting pretty big on Natalie Portman's character (or the couple, Adam and Eve?) when he sent the husband back to their house. 
I do think it was the ""original"" Lena that went out, not her doppelganger, as this doesn't matter, she has the necessary mutations already.",7zqsdy

My early theory after the group enters Area X and Lena realizes that DNA is being merged through different species and plant life, right after the crocodile/shark attack was that everything was merging to become the building blocks of a new cell. Area X was growing like a single cell mentioned earlier in the film and eventually it would split into two then four, then eight and so on creating life that is on a much larger scale than our own. The splitting of the prism cells from the regular cells is the process of creating the proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, etc. that create cells which meant eventually everything in Area X would become chemicals and water to create a nucleus. Starting from sub-atomic/string levels up to the current size scale portrayed in the film. That obviously didn't happen but I thought that could be an interesting take on a science fiction story.

dwa4ftr,"So, I just saw this and I've been thinking about it. 

It's super weird the alien force does 2 things

1. it expands the shimmer, and it's indicated if humanity does nothing then it will just encompass the whole world and turn it into alien land

2. it also copies people and sends them out of the shimmer back into the real world 

these two things seem contradictory, I mean, if they don't stop the expansion then the clone replacement people will be useless right? 

The shimmer also took the woman physicist into itself, absorbed her, and then later in the movie it just shuts off - so what happened to her? Perhaps this can be a crazy spin off sequel where after the shimmer shuts off she is still conscious , but now she's some super powered higher consciousness hippy tree woman?

The beginning was gray and bland, and I was intrigued but worried until about the 1 1 and 1/4 mark where we got to the watchtower. The colors and soundtrack ramped up, and it leads to a phenomenal final 20 minutes. I can see why people didn't like it, but I don't think it was overly thought provoking, and it did a passable job of answering questions... even if it was a touch general.[yeah our DNA is getting fucked by the spectrum coming from the alien in the lighthouse](#spoiler) 

The visuals toward the end were great, and that bear scene was scary as shit. The movie was great. I will see anything Garland does from here on out. ",7zqsdy
dwcnek0,"Theory: Josie, the physicist that turns into a tree, states that the Shimmer refracts everything. Scattering light and radio waves, therefore all forms of radiation, but also 'refracting' everything.

-
Let's take 'everything' literally, since we saw DNA blended together across species of plants and animals, as well as the voice of Shepard in the bear that killed her. Implying that the bear's biology was changed to be able to make those sounds, whether her mind was actually a part of the bear is difficult to tell. The bear acted much like a bear would seem to but it is possible it at least recognized the girls.

-
More to the theorizing.

If the Shimmer refracts literally everything that would include memories, emotions, and thoughts in general. Meaning you would be able to influence the reality around you with your mind, given time and intent. First, time: It is evident that the changes take time since the characters don't recognize any change for quite a while into the movie. The only exception would be the lost time after first entering the Shimmer, which is some sort of short term memory loss. Second, intent: It is not evident from the film, but if thoughts can be refracted into other creatures or into the environment around you, then you can also change yourself physically and mentally over whatever time it takes for enough refraction to take place.

-
If we take the previous as a given then we can infer that this transformation process can be controlled to some extent. Meaning that the end could mean Lena and Kane (clone) are in control of their changes from this point forward. At least to some extent.

-
I'm not going to dive into it more than that since I am not particularly intelligent or a movie buff. This is just my idea of what is going on after my first watch.

From my standpoint it is an extremely exciting concept and Lena probably gets the immortality she mentions earlier on in the movie. Although events after the end of any movie are total speculation, I would like to think that they have a child that is able to influence reality around them making for all sorts of strange things in a childhood. A real monster under the bed or in the closet and real imaginary friends. ",7zqsdy

e02novh,"Just finished the movie and loved it. It did not start off that way. It seems a main theme running through the whole movie was, way do things have to die or  self-destruction. When the Lena brought that up in the beginning I was so off put by that. Saying that it was a flaw in our design. Not only is death functional but I think it gives life its meaning or at least part of it.

Functional is easy to explain. It's makes for way more diversity. When the old die, new things can grow and flourish. Also when thing become to stagnate they tend to die all at once. An example would be a forest fire. Many think of that as a bad thing but it is not. If a forest does not have fires it collects dead wood. If a forest collects to much dead wood then when a fire does happen the whole forest is wiped out. If a forest is aloud to have fires then when a fire reaches a place that had a fire there is nothing to burn. 

The part where it gives life its meaning is a little more fuzzy but it makes sense to me. I have always had a problem with living for ever. The only time I thought about that was when I thought of heaven. I boiled it down supply and demand. When something goes infinite it loses value. The most valuable thing to you right now is air. Without it you would be died within minutes but we don't have to work for it. 
Maybe a better way to look at this is comparing life to a good book or TV show. The good books/shows always end. The bad ones try to add way to much on.  ",7zqsdy

I’ve read so much into the theories and the interpretations and it’s all so insightful and clever, and I’m sure correct, but I can’t shake how this movie left me feeling. A film has not gotten under my skin in this way in a very, very long time.

As the credits started to roll I was left shaken, I couldn’t even get up from my seat. That’s a testament to what Garland and the rest of the cast and crew have achieved here. This movie was firing on all cylinders, so it was absolutely a group effort and a group success. While having a little clunkier dialogue than what we’d normally expect from Garland, I thought it was still fitting of the tone of the rest of the film. 

It was visually stunning, like absolutely surreal. The score was INCREDIBLE. Somber, lonely but alive, that progressively turns electronic and harrowing. The metallic, booming droning (the track is called The Alien) during the climactic scene had me pushed back into my chair, jaw-dropped, knuckles white from clenching the arm rests. The performances, save Leigh’s unfortunately, were stellar. And the bear. The fucking bear. I was mortified. One of the most disturbing things I’ve ever seen.

What a fucking movie. If you are lucky enough to live in the USA or China, do yourself a favor and catch this flick in theatres.

She discusses how life started from one cell and the shimmer is essentially the reversal or antithesis of this -- instead of the cell replicating and causing all of these different mutations and changes in life, in the shimmer, the replication brings more and more likeness. This process is the annihilation as the shimmer grows and takes in more dna/cells from the areas around it, the life-force inside the shimmer takes from those it encompasses and also shares the DNA/cells from what it's already taken. Eventually causing singularity of DNA and everything returns to one cell (reverting to the way things were at the creation of the Universe: 1 Cell that lives on, forever).

I thought this was a very well done, heavy sci-fi picture. Alex Garland went for broke with all the sci-fi elements of the movie and I never felt like he was making me feel dumb. The movie is also incredibly pretty but, like the whole emphasis of the film as a whole, it also looks menacing to view as well. It is an incredibly tense movie the entire way and since I didn't read the books I had no idea how this movie was gonna end.

The unsung heroes of this movie? The composers! The soundtrack for this music really got me in a way I haven't experienced since discovering Cliff Martinez for the first time. Just a haunting listen from beginning to end and it enhances the dread of the picture as well.

This was an incredibly well made movie with great performances the entire way through. Makes me want to read the books this movie is based off of and I really think Alex Garland is the next, great sci-fi Director after his first two movies.",7zqsdy
duuavn0,"When Lena shot the alien and it turned into slenderman I said ""FUCK THAAAAAAT."" Jesus was that nightmare fuel for me.

I think the psychologist pointing out that Lena was a soldier/scientist was significant to the theme. The shimmer causes dna refraction which causes everything it contacts to change and evolve. Lena fell in love with her husband when they were both soldiers and therefore on equal ground. 

Lena evolved and became more than just a soldier. She became and academic and Kane stayed behind because he, as a person, is fundamentally a soldier. Nothing more, nothing less. 

When Lena evolves into something more, she falls out love with Kane and begins an affair with someone who can be seen as her intellectual equal. I think Garland is saying that throughout life people change and if your surrounding dont evolve with with you then you leave them behind for something better suited. 

I think Kane didnt want to change for Lena, nor could he, but was still so in love with her that he was willing to sacrifice his own personal life to send a copy of himself back to Lena to essentially reboot the relationship. Since shimmer Kane has no knowledge of the affair he can love Lena without the hesitations the real Kane would have and Lena is free told mold shimmer Kane into the perfect husband she wants him to be.

dvy5z01,"I don't think this was a bad movie, or a boring one. Not sure what people are expecting from Sci-Fi films... I thought it was very well paced. The plot revelations/twists were all within the story i.e. her affair, when they realize that the Shimmer is a genetic prism, even the reveal in the end that Kane's clone was the one in the real world. 

My questions / thoughts pertaining to this movie... 

* Why was Kane's clone failing (health)? I guess the easy way to explain it is that he's away from the Shimmer, so his body begins to degrade. But if the connection to the Shimmer is that strong then the destruction of the ""nest"" should have also destroyed him.  If his body was just failing naturally because Kane's body was failing at time of cloning, then destruction of the ""nest"" wouldn't have any impact on Kane Clone's health. This is a big plot hole for me. 
* How the heck did the freak bear gain the ability to ""talk""? They are implying that the bear can take genetic material and instantly replicate functions/abilities of the host? That's really far fetched to me. 
* Why didn't they take more precautions? They knew that no team has ever come back, yet they send them in there with rags and a back pack. No one thinks to bring things like... a breathing mask? They seem to know very little about what kills people in the Shimmer but basically sends everyone in like it's a long hike. 
* If no one has ever come back, wouldn't they think to try something like... oh I dunno, TETHER someone? That should have been the FIRST thing they tried. Send in one person who is tethered and then ""pull"" him/her out after an exploratory time frame. Surely they would have eventually learned the ground rules of the Shimmer: life is genetically altered, people suffer memory loss, instrumentation doesn't work, time is distorted etc.
* The root story of Annihilation is a pretty good one. I like the play on human nature i.e. self destruction. But the scientific/exploratory approach to assessing what the Shimmer is, is shockingly bad and almost unbelievable. If there's one place where this movie loses me a little, that has to be it. It sticks out like a pretty big thorn. ",7zqsdy

dvyry3h,"At the start of the film we see the bolt of energy hurtle out of the sky and slam into the lighthouse. The lighthouse (a beacon/ guiding light normally) becomes the source of a spreading mutation. What was the thing that hit the lighthouse? I think it wasn't a thing but an event - Natalie Portman's infidelity.  In this sense I think the lighthouse is the centre of Kane's personality or psyche.

The shimmer represents the destructive urges we all have. Kane's character is driven into it because of the affair. Portman's character follows him in driven by her guilt.  She journeys to it's centre and sees the old Kane die, ruined by the affair (before he dies he says ""I thought I was a man"". The affair has emasculated him). He is replaced by the new mutated Kane. She goes even deeper, below the lighthouse and looks into the heart of the thing.  She confronts her changed self, believes she has destroyed it and resisted being changed by the everything that's happened but in the final scene we learn that she too, of course, is different.

The magnitude of the affair divided the personalities of Kane and Lena into before and after in the same way that cells divide. After a cell divides the old and the new cell can co-exist, unless the mutation is cancerous in which case the malignancy will spread, destroying and remaking everything it touches.

The effect of the affair is a cancerous mutation. The pre-affair versions of Kane and Lena's personalities couldn't co-exist with the post-affair versions. In Kane's case the malignant version destroyed the old Kane and left something altered and new. In Lena the ""old"" version fought off the cancerous version and stopped the cancer from spreading.

The films works on many levels but fundamentally I think it is a story of their relationship and the damage done by the affair. In the end it is hopeful - she accepts the changed Kane because she caused it. They can coexist.

Also- that fucking bear thing! Yikes. I think it represents the horrible fact that many people who die of cancer are remembered for how they were at the end and not for how they were when they were healthy.  The bear only ""stores"" its victims gruesome deaths and one of the characters remarks about how awful it is that that is the only part of them that will endure.

dusider,"The more I think about this movie the more I like it. Granted I just found out that it was loosely based on a book, and I walked about honestly feeling indifferent about the film.

I think the theme of the movie is the strong part. Coming from a biology background I was able to make sense of what they were trying to convey. Things in nature aren't good or bad, they are just nature.  The idea of morals, and the distinction of good and bad are things humans have invented. 

The parallel throughout the movie to cancer also nailed this point home to me. Natalie Portman in the beginning talks about how life starts out as one cell that continue dividing to form what we have today. Cancer does the same thing. One cell begins to divide and forms a cancer. 

We associate cancer with being a bad thing because it kill you. However I think the message was cancer is probably not necessarily bad or good. 

All 'normal' life on earth is built upon the flaw of imperfect replication. It is the reason for death, and the finite nature of life. Cancer doesn't have this problem, Cancer has fixed this glitch. 

The Aliens in this movie aren't good, and they aren't bad. They are different. This difference is the change they talk about. The mutations, the distortion of energy fields... Its all change. For the better or for the worse its honestly random - like nature. 

When we see the alien form from Natalie at the end it shows us the alien really does have goals. Its just existing.

some notes:

Cass died first because like her child that was stolen from her, nature is unfair and will take away sometimes. plus her survey reports and (geographical) knowledge wouldn't be very helpful in the shimmer.

Anya dies because she went on a bender hallucinated bc of her substance abuse. paranoia, something about gags, drinking, her getting her jaw ripped off. She is afraid. Her fear gets her one of the worst deaths. The paramedic ironically tried to get everyone killed.

Josie dies because she accepts the shimmer her cuts were like irrigation for the annihilation to begin but she accepted it. her death was accepting the nature of the situation

Ventress dies because she was too willing to accept death. She was obviously unhinged from the start (gr8 acting) and gets her mind blown in the end.

The ouroboros tattoo represents both self destruction, infinity, and looks like 2 splitting cells. a pair of wedding rings?? Lena was ready to self destruct, her clone immediately went into self destruct mode. Lena self destructed their marriage. As a doctor she potentially infects the whole world.

This is a great film that recycles classic sci fi horror tropes all while being loaded with ambiguous symbology. Isaac, and Jason Leigh are real creepy in this one.

Autophagy is where cell components are broken down (sometimes whole cells) & reused to make new components.

In the very beginning of the movie, Lena says during the lecture that they'll be looking at autophagic activity of cancer cells. Many already mentioned this but I also saw The Shimmer as kind of an ""ecological cancer""

I love this movie!",7zqsdy
dvm9px8,"What a wonderful movie with such an original way to explore an never-before-seen alien life form, the way it behaves, the way it affects the world and others. I honestly wanted the shimmer to take the whole world. The ending leaves room for imagination.

The cinematography, the colors, the atmosphere, the mystery. It’s just wonderful! Hell, even the credits are amazing. ",7zqsdy
dvpyfcb,"I think my expectations were too high. People talking about Cronenberg and Chrichton, Apocalypse now meets Arrival... what I got felt like an elongated episode of Lost.

I'm glad others seem to have enjoyed it but it was all a bit ""meh"" for me. 

EDIT: I liked the premise. It just never followed through enough for me to really get on board.",7zqsdy
dvy4q1o,"So, I somewhat mistakenly watched this film last night on the comedown from an acid trip. Oh boy. 

I wasn't really into the first act, despite a good performance by Natalie Portman, the dialogue was a little wooden and the atmosphere felt a little disjointed. I also really didn't like Jennifer Jason Leigh in this film, there was something about her voice (disinterest?) that was grinding my gears.

With that said, however, once they entered the shimmer I literally could not take my eyes off the screen. The way the light bounced and refracted was absolutely stunning and very reminiscent of an acid trip, and it looked to me like there was a good deal of repeating foliage in the background of lingering shots (could have been the acid though). 

I really had absolutely no idea what was gonna happen, the film did an exceptional job of building tension, I had this incredible feeling of dread building up in my stomach as I watched. Obvious highlights were the two found footage tapes of Kane, the twisted and mutated body of the soldier in the pool, and the fucking bear scene man. Jesus, I haven't been scared like that in a long, long time.

That final act was absolutely unbelievable. I could not take my eyes off the screen. Ventress' pale and eyeless face, shrouded in darkness as Lena enters the hole in the lighthouse really shook me. And the mandelbulb representation was absolutely stunning, far and away the best visualization of cosmic horror that I have ever seen. I really feared for Lena's character when the entity was copying her movement's, truly claustrophobic when she was trapped against the door. The score was fantastic as well, played a huge part in creating that building sense of dread.

Honestly, I need a few days to think about that ending and my interpretation of the movie as a whole, but that was hands down one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. I'm not sure I could handle another watch, it's gonna stick with me for a while.",7zqsdy
dw6y3p1,"I love the movie but there is something thats bugging me. 

Why can't they just get a boat and drive right up on to the coast and go in to the lighthouse ? they said they had tried going by sea but we never see any boats or hear what happened to them. 

If it cuts out power of the ship then why not use a sail boat ? ",7zqsdy
dw9bm4o,"Loved the movie.  To me there was something very Murakami about it like Kafka on the Shore where the characters all have to really face themselves.  Who they are, what they want, and HOW do they handle the darkest parts of themselves.  Obviously that all ties into the self destruct theme but it says something about Lena and Kane as characters.

Lena and Kane have the strength to make it out of the shimmer.  They're not the same people anymore because they've taken the longest hardest look inside themselves, battled those demons and came out alive.

That's my interpretation anyway. ",7zqsdy

duqnj76,"Just watched, here are my thoughts while still fresh. I enjoyed it tho found the last third weak. I wanted to see more of the freaky nature. I feel like she got to the lighthouse way too easily. If there's no purpose for the Shimmer, what's up with the forced ""ANNIHILATION"" line? What did the psychologist find exactly? And how come a mirror person didn't show up for her? Destroying which part of the lighthouse removed the Shimmer? Why did Nina not get affected as much as the others? Think they mentioned at the start she hasn't eaten for weeks tho I couldn't quite hear. Mainly confused about mirror ppl bit",7zqsdy
duqq8v7,"First off loved this movie, so don’t construe my question(s) as an attack, but I am curious if he following was better explained in the book:

Why did they keep only sending in small groups? Why not incrementally explore the place? Send in tanks? Trucks? Helicopters? Go by ocean? Burn it down?

I can’t decide if these are nitpicking questions, in which case I’ll drop them, or if there is a well thought out reason, which would be compelling as well.",7zqsdy

It is unfortunate, because I had read the book in anticipation for the movie.

Had I known how drastically different the movie was going to be from the book, I would have done things the other way around... watching the movie first and reading the book afterwards. 

Now that I don't have any expectations, I am going to have to watch the film again. I think I will end up appreciating it much more.

duqwt09,"I have one question. If the lighthouse was on the coast and all they had to do to get out of the shimmer was follow the coast back to the base, why didn't they just take the coast to the lighthouse? Their objective was to get to the lighthouse and while you could argue that they were trying to explore it (the shimmer), literally everyone but one guy had died inside. Why risk it? Why wouldn't they go straight to the lighthouse if they had the option? 

EDIT: Edited for clarity.",7zqsdy

dusom8q,"Jeez this film is all question and no answer. 


I think it’s clear that we’re meant to think the real Kane killed himself, though I don’t think that has to be the case. Certainly the line “I used to think I was a guy named Kane” is something a clone would say. What I don’t understand is why he killed himself, especially since he was hanging out with his doppelgänger who was going to go try to find his wife. It’s frustrating that’s all we saw of their interaction, which clearly progressed much farther and might have involved some amount of communication.

I wonder what happened to Ventress, I have been wondering if what we encountered was her clone. When Lena first enters the chamber, Ventress is looking away and from our perspective her face seems weird and blocky the way Lena’s clone does later as it catches on fire.

Did Lena escape or did her clone give a false debriefing? If the clone escaped, what really happened at the lighthouse that destroyed it?

What was going on with screambear? It killed whats her face, dragged her off, and abandoned the body without eating any of it. Later, it does the same thing at the house. It seems more like it’s killing without the motivation of hunger. Also weird is the way it doesn’t immediately attack the people that were tied up, and then it bites the physicist to seemingly try and provoke a reaction.

What’s going on with the whole invasion of the body snatchers thing? What purpose does it serve? 

If Kane is a clone, what does that mean in practice? How much is a copy of Kane, and how much is he an alien body and mind? Why does the clone get better after the lighthouse is destroyed?

Now that clone Kane and maybe clone Lena are out what happens next?

We’re never going to get the answers to any of these questions except maybe on a bluray directors commentary, but I doubt it.",7zqsdy
dussi5i,"The introduction of organic life to earth was a strange new stage of development unlike anything that came before it, and that's exactly what the Shimmer was in relation to earth with organic life.  The earth existed for billions of years before the first cells came into fruition.  Earth sans life was very much normal, and the introduction of life completely disrupted the mechanics of how lifeless-earth worked.  It doesn't make sense to think of life as ""wanting"" anything.

lastly, does anyone think that the clone cooperates with the self when the self finally accepts death (kane and lena both think of blowing up themselves). I am assuming that Lena sees death as the only way out when she picks up the bomb but then her primal instinct to live kicks in.

duqudi2,"Just saw this movie and I thought it was really *really* cool. I don't know what the hell I just watched, but it was cool nonetheless. Audio and Visuals were beautiful, that's almost an objective fact. That little riff from the main theme is haunting as f--k, but I find myself wanting to buy it and listen over and over.

Story was pretty good, granted I'm a simple minded moviegoer, I don't really know what the big take-away was (or if there even was one). I didn't really understand most of the sciencemumbojumbo, but I was just way too captured by the visuals, acting, and score to care. 

**One of the biggest thoughts** I had was just how beautifully death was portrayed in this movie (except for the manbearpig attacks, of course). The treepeople, crazy blooming fungus corpses, [the third-to-last-character's death, she just walks away, not confronting anything](#spoiler), and [Oscar Issac and Natalie Portman's deaths](#spoiler). It made me really *uneasy* because some of the gore and dead bodies are beautiful, but absolutely fucking obliterated. Haven't gone to sleep yet tonight, we'll see if its nightmare inducing! (God help me)

Admittedly it was a little slow at the start, but the climax made it all worth it (whatever the hell it was).

And a note about the **audio**. God damn incredible. Could've just been my theater, but there were some parts that seemed incredibly loud, like louder than I've ever heard in another movie. The music playing during the snake intestine scene, the main theme during the climax. But the music being loud *worked*, almost like a tinnitus that you'd get as you're hallucinating badly, it drowns everything else out.

In the vein of *Ex Machina's* exploration of consciousness and artificial intelligence's need for humans, *Arrival's* dissection of time, and even *Blade Runner 2049's* creation of a feeling through the exploration of a consciousness in a dystopic future.

Here, we have what feels like a typical survival movie wrapped in some interesting biological science. The major difference is that, the plot of surviving feels more central to the movie than the human implications of this biological phenomenon. I think a good sci-fi movie should package this in the reverse, where the plot is simply the device they express their greater idea. This was absolutely lacking in Annihilation.

Maybe it's because I went into this with the expectation of an Arrival-like experience, that I left disappointed. ",7zqsdy

dus0185,"SPOILERS BELOW

I watched this film at the first showing at my theater last night. I'm still thinking about it today. Walking out of the theater, I didn't know quite what to feel. That sentiment isn't about the film, because I thoroughly enjoyed the film. But I just didn't know how to feel internally. The concept of self-destruction, the beauty of the growth and change in the film...I had a lot of emotions and feelings swimming inside me, almost like the intestines within the fated to die soldier.

I adored the pacing of this film. Blade Runner 2049 was my favorite film of 2017, and much like it, the scenes breathed, without quick cuts or changes between settings.

Walking out of the theater, I thought of many other films I had seen before that ""Annihilation"" seemed to echo. Tarkovsky's ""Stalker"" (in my top five favorite films of all time), ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Alien"", and a few others. The cerebral experience, coupled with the visual splendor, really stood out. Visually, the film was a beautiful exercise in film production, really showcasing how much visuals aide in the storytelling of a film. The dynamic and colorful representation of the growths in the film often times bordered on the grotesque. Or in the case of some of the monsters, horrifying. Yet all of these also presented a world within the shimmer that was experiencing change and, again, growth. And I found the contrast of change in either growth or self-destruction, and the bleed between the two, to be presented effectively.

The five female leads all carried the film wonderfully. All the characters went into the Shimmer because while maybe on the outside they had things together, they were really breaking, falling apart, self-destructing. Seeing that self-destruction manifest itself in different forms for each character was never one-note; it was emotional, and effectively drove the characters and story forward.

The score of the film, occasionally making use of the Hans Zimmer-esque ""BWAM!"", other time using acoustic guitar melodies, with work from Geoff Barrow of Portishead, was mesmerizing, beautiful, and served to highlight the film's imagery.

The ending...oh the ending. I'm still processing it, working through the implications and where the characters are at in those closing scenes. I'll come back. But damn, did I love that ending.

There were some bits of clunky dialogue, but Alex Garland did a pretty effective job of staying away from tired tropes of ""explain in english"" and the like, allowing any explanations to live a bit more naturally in the film than they would have in lesser films. While there were many points throughout the film that said the actual words ""annihilation"" or ""self-destruction"", the film still required the viewer to search for that in the characters, and how they chose to live out that pain.

I'm sure I'll come back and add more to the thoughts I made above, but until then, I'll just say that ""Annihilation"" was a fantastic film, a privilege to watch, and hopefully a film that signals for more films of the like that challenge the viewers. I can't wait to watch this film again.

I also really want to hear what people thought, and why people didn't like the film. I can point to reasons people wouldn't, such as not liking pacing, writing, tone, or it really just not being a film for them. Whatever it is, I just enjoy the conversation with people who enjoy film.

dv5fnqi,Holy hell that movie was fucking awesome.,7zqsdy
dv6sexv,"Three viewings and still thinking about this film. I enjoyed the first viewing, but the film gains a lot on repeat viewing. 

* Scenes with Ventress seem more tense. She knows that Natalie cheated because that's what Kane told her during his assessment to go into the shimmer. It changes the context of a lot of her lines. Iy also contextualized the scene where Anya ties them all up. Anya calls Lena a liar for hiding her connection to Kane, sweet sweet irony.

* There's a lot of foreshadowing that Kane is a clone. The biggest piece was the scene with the two deer that almost cartoonishly matched each other's movements. One was bright and grew flowers from its antlers. The other was dark and had a dirty fur tone. This seemed to juxtapose light and dark, which is part of a different head canon too.

* I've heard some people criticize the performances, but they really worked for me. There's a subtly in Anya and why she betrays the group. Despite hardly getting to know her, Tessa still looks like a different character at the end of the film, and not just because her sleeves were gone. Isaac gives a very subtle performance that I also think was underrated. Given the circumstances of this story all the performances work. These characters really don't have chemistry with each other, and it's more narratively satisfying than if they did. There were a couple of hammy lines, but that's unavoidable in sci-fi usually.

* There is a shot at the end of the film where Lena's hand refracts to the opposite side of a glass of water. I think this is a visual metaphor for the finale. The ""alien"" was an almost perfect reflection with slight aberrations. 

I will likely see this movie again. This film has a lot of subtle details that really adds depth and room for discussion.",7zqsdy
dvl9u7b,"So the movie referenced both Alien and The Thing in the bear scene right?

Lovecraft would be proud of this movie btw.",7zqsdy
dvoslqc,"So I just saw this film, and holy fuck I loved it. It has the thematic deepness and simply depth that Ex Machina has, combined with the introspection of humanity that Arrival has, combined with some real Lovecraftian visuals/monsters. The latter of which may be the closest I've seen on film in emulation of his works.

I won't talk about what's already been said, the bear scene in particular (Jaw-dropping intensity and horror), and also the camera-stomach scene (FUCKING amazingly done), but I wanna say two things I'm critical of:

I honestly felt the death of Jennifer Jason-Leigh's character was a bit cheap; her exploding out the way she did. I can understand that the end result kiiiiiiiiinda made it so that had to occur the way it did but for me (Personally, of course) it felt a bit cheap, like a Crystal Skull moment. 

The dialogue was a bit cheap at times, but honestly it was more like 2 or 3 thinly written lines. The dialogue when Kane and Lena are in bed together is fantastically written.

I'm curious as to how the skeletons got there outside the lighthouse... Surely they didn't evolve from the sand there? 

And my biggest question of them all; the ***tattoo***. What did it mean? I couldn't get a good view of it... plus they didn't have it before they went in so it couldn't possibly be mutated onto them?

I loved this film overrall. SO **tightly** directed, the film has an incredible ***weight*** to it. I'm just so so sad that theatrical release was only in US... coming from Australia, Netflix's poor streaming rates hurt the visuals a bit, which definitely would've been something damned to see on the big screen. I'm gonna literally call up cinemas and ask them if they can screen this film because it is a **MUST** for theatrical screenings.",7zqsdy

dvrfbl3,"""Lena"" is definitely lying about what happened. ",7zqsdy
dvx4poj,"Visually, this movie was 10/10. 

Things I disliked: 
JJL's acting as Ventress. I understand that she was playing a [terminally ill character who has nothing left to live for except for solving the shimmer](#spoiler), but her performance was super SUPER flat and she was a bore the whole time she was on-screen. 

The scene with the LSAW or whatever the machine gun was. Why include it? Anya says something along the lines of: [""this is cool...too heavy to carry though](#spoiler), indicating that maybe they'd hear it being used later on, and that would imply that somebody else was in the shimmer with them. But nothing.

Nerdy girl with glasses having to decode everything for the audience. 

The backstory with [Lena's affair with Daniel](#spoiler). It didn't add any depth to Natalie Portman's character (IMO), and each one of those scenes seemed like they'd been added in post-production. 

The single scene about them not remembering the first 3 days of their expedition...it was brought up once and then not again for the rest of the movie... Even if they included a scene where they realise they have to write down what they did that day and tell their future selves what to do to keep on-mission, that would make a lot more sense without discounting the whole ""time is different in the shimmer compared to outside"" theory. 

Also wondering if anyone can shed some light on the human skeletons arranged outside the lighthouse? And, were Ventress' eyes & face all messed up when she went down the tunnel? Watching on small TV and it looked like her face was grey with no defining features.

Overall 7/10 for visual effects, original storyline, and mix of genres.

",7zqsdy
dvxeudq,"Solid film, visually stunning. Though I think the point of the film is there is no point. The shimmer just does, it exists, there is no point to it. All the mutations and refraction are all incidental, similar to the universe and life. 

Nice to see weird sci-fi film make you think. It’s not something I’d pay to watch twice though. I never really felt connected to any of the characters or invested in any of their struggles. Portman’s back story is the only one really fleshed out, and even then I didn’t really feel as though I knew her. Them pretty much spoiling that Portman would survive was a massive mistake, since she was the only character I somewhat cared about living and knowing she does almost completely detached me from the adventure. I felt like I was “watching” the movie and not really immersed with the characters.",7zqsdy
dwpxvn5,"Just finished this and I'm a bit torn. I like his previous work a lot and this had really great moments but felt pretty uneven.

I didn't find any characters to be all that fleshed out or interesting. I can deal just fine without knowing all that much about a character but not so much when they're boring/forgettable. For instance, I can only name 2 of the characters that went into the shimmer and I just watched the movie. I know I heard their names but I can't recall them. It's one of those movies where moments, characters and plot are incredibly memorable or not at all. It just felt uneven.

It starts pretty interesting but then takes a long, boring slog for the entire meat of the movie. I didn't care about ""woman that went crazy"" (Anya?) or ""clearly European woman trying not to sound European"". I just didn't care about them as characters. Same for JJL and Tessa Thompson. Tessa did a fine job though and I did like a few of her festured scenes.
  Natalie Portman did a fine job, too. It wasn't that the acting was bad but just not put toward characters I care about in any way. I really like Oscar Isaac and he was also pretty useless here.

That said, the ending was incredible. TBH, the ending pushed this movie to a 7/10 for me when it was about a 5/10 before. I almost gave up a few times and I'm glad I didn't. The last 30 min could have been a short story I'd really enjoy so if you watch it you'll have that much.

The sound design really shines throughout and steps up big-time at the end. I really like the ambiguity and open ending that the director is known for here.

Again, 7/10 but not a consistent 7/10. It's a 10 in some places and a 4 in others.",7zqsdy
e01zwbh,"I thought to mention that the movie seemed to me to present psychological problem situations that the characters present and are part of.

dwd6nt4,"I thought it was a good movie with thought-provoking concepts, striking visuals, and some good lead performances, but that it was marred by illogical turns of the plot. 

For example, I find it highly implausible that NO expedition could have returned from the shimmer. Wouldn't the very first expeditions be limited in nature, just scouting the very edge of it before returning? Even with [lapses in memory,](#spoiler) that should have been fully possible. Second, they say that probes haven't worked either but what about a a long pole with a camera on the end? Stick it in and then pull it out. There doesn't seem to be anything preventing that.

Another plot twist that I had a problem with was [the EMT character suddenly becoming extremely paranoid when the other team members did not.](#spoiler) I mean, they are fully aware of the possible psychological effects of the shimmer. Wouldn't the teams have received extensive training and conditioning to avoid this very outcome? Might they even be required to take anti-anxiety/anti-psychotic medication while in the shimmer? I find it highly implausible that it could have gotten as far as it did in the film. 

Finally, I think it's nonsense that they didn't [attempt to return the memory cards and other evidence from past expeditions.](#spoiler) The outside world knows almost NOTHING about this phenomenon. They had no way of knowing that Lena would be able to [destroy the shimmer.](#spoiler) The right thing to do to help humanity understand the shimmer would be to gather as much knowledge as possible and return with it.

dv9n8ix,"It seemed like a love child between *Stalker*, *Solaris*, and *2001* all with a very American flair.

As many people will note, the visuals were stunning. I'm by no means a ""psychonaut,"" but if you've ever taken psychedelics, you will notice visuals that practically mimic the effect of LSD or psilocybin. The Shimmer provides this iridescent effect on nature--a fragmented batch of bright colors and patterns splattered through the drudges of a never-ending marshland. Make no mistake: this sci-fi/horror/thriller is definitely a bad trip. (Spoilers below)

I really liked the film up until the third act. The narrative began to unravel once the one solider becomes overwrought with paranoia and captures the rest of the troop. The mental drain from The Shimmer was evident, but the one soldier's freak-out was so abrupt over a pretty dumb reason. To be skeptical after not revealing that Kane was the protag's husband? Sure. But her reaction was too sudden and left out an opportunity to build more dread and suspense.

The ending will undoubtedly be the subject of many conversations. I did not care for the ambiguity. Ex Machina's narrative was air tight. It brought up similar philosophical themes and thoughts, applied them to the specific narrative at hand, and provided a conclusion that wasn't blatant, but also allowed the audience the ability to unpack its meaning. In Annihilation, we know for a fact that Original Kane died in the lighthouse, leaving Copy Kane to survive. The final shot and lack of response from the protag lets us know that, though she is the Original Lena, she has changed in some profound way after staring into that cosmic entity.

But what are we to make of this? What will the evolution of this alien entity through Lena and Kane mean for the rest of mankind? Will that continue to ""create something new"" with the earth? If so, why is that similar kind of interaction not happening within the science center's research center? If everything within The Shimmer was destroyed, how was Clone Kane able to stay alive outside The Shimmer? Was it because he was outside of The Shimmer, or was it because he evolved into something beyond the organisms within The Shimmer? What are we to expect Clone Kane and Changed Lena to do now? I was unsure as to how I was even supposed to react, but not in a positive way EG last thirty minutes of 2001, which it so clearly emulates. Instead of making you ponder these ambiguities, this film moreso feels like it has the answers but is hiding them behind its back.

I understand on the surface level, the film is about ""self-destruction"" (rather than suicide--that speech from the psychologist was a little ham-fisted, btw). Lena's infidelity with her co-worker was clearly what was ""self-destructing"" her and her valued relationship with Kane. She is now able to co-exist with a version of Kane who is unaware of the infidelity, so in that sense, it's a ""happy ending."" But what about the bigger picture?

Definitely a thrill ride to say the least. See this on the big screen if you can! ",7zqsdy

duqn1c4,"I think Ex Machina is a better film in practically every way, the characters are more dynamic, more complex and they felt more real with much stronger dialogue and less of an attempt to pull on heartstrings artificially, the themes were much better conveyed  and the logic was a lot more consistent. Ex Machina to me is a top three science fiction film of all time

Annihilation is interesting, it has grand themes about evolution and the species on our planet  and challenges the audience to ask thought provoking questions about the nature of human existence. However these characters were a bit shallow, they simply weren’t given enough time to breathe and feel real, and there too many moments of characters telling the audience what they’re feeling and what their histories are. This should be shown to the audience not told. The editing was also done in a way where it was very confusing for no reason, the whole jumping back and forth between scenes taking place at different times is very jarring. And the logical consistency wasn’t present all the way through like why didn’t they take a military escort with them? How was one of the characters able to tie three separate people to chairs all by themselves? I know they were sleeping but surely one of them would have heard the loud yelling in the next room? Also this is just a personal pet peeve of mine but I hate when characters are interrupted by danger in the middle of a conversation conveying meaningful plot info but that’s just me, I don’t like that. I feel like this film hit a lot of science fiction tropes that Ex Machina actively rejected. So as you can imagine I’m a bit disappointed. It was a very tense film though ",7zqsdy
duqotkd,"I want to like this film. The acting is good, the setting is good, the visuals are amazing. The whole movie filled me with dread in a way that I don't think I've felt since first watching The Thing.

But all that said, I just don't think I can say I liked it. It felt like in leaning so hard on the theme and the mystery, they lost the heart and character development that I feel like you need in such a trippy film. Arrival was also trippy, high-concept sci-fi, but I felt way more invested in Amy Adam's decisions than Natalie Portman's.

So, I don't know. I'd still recommend people go see it, but I'm not sure I'll remember much about it in a year or two. (Except the bear, holy shit).",7zqsdy
duqs5wq,"Wow... I was completely blown away by this film. Traveling through the shimmer was a psychedelic trip fueled by both nightmare and dream.

Alex Garland has created a beautiful vision and I am left in awe.  ",7zqsdy
dutlmv5,"I liked the first act, and the ending. 

Personally, I had an issue with the monster movie scares of the middle act. I know we had to feel some kind of doom, but the dread of going crazy and self-destruction, to me, is much more interesting than the dread of scary monsters.

I think that the film's monster-of-the-week moments (Alligator, bear pig, stomach bug) were at odds, tonally, with the existential dread that permeated the rest of it. I think there is a way to show these creatures in a slightly less pulpy, horror-movie way. It felt a tiny bit campy to me, somehow less real than the slow-burn of the rest of the film. It is a dark movie about the destruction of self, and even though the bear with Cass's voice was completely terrifying, I think it didn't really fit.

I think the middle act would have been more effective if the monster-of-the-week scenes were more about the threat of the unknown than seeing them so close up.  I think that the most terrifying moment of the film is when we're watching Kane's video camera and when he films the portal in the floor, you see the briefest glimpse of the shimmer alien, and then he quickly turns around. The bear-pig would have been more effective if we heard it more, and saw it less.

I think that the film's climax of Lena coming to face-to-face with the shimmer, as it perfectly mimics her body, would also have a bigger impact if the scientist wasn't interviewing her as a framing device. You can have that as part of the epilogue, but it felt very clunky the way it was interwoven with the plot, and it showed us that at least one of the Lenas would make it out alive, taking away some tension from the scene.

I had issues with the interviewing framing device, and middle act of the film. Some of the dialogue was clunky, but it makes a little bit of sense if you consider that each character was trying to have as little emotional involvement as possible. Not Natalie Portman's best performance, but she pulled it off, it was fine. 

Overall, really great film hampered by a troublesome middle act. I give it a B",7zqsdy

duvf0bg,"Damn, I was so hyped about this one but it was kind of a let down. 

Let's start by saying that it is impossible anybody cared about these characters. They had good ideas on where to go with them but they ended up being developed very poorly. I'm mostly bummed about Jennifer Leigh's character. She had potential but when you recompile all her scenes she kinda looked like a Robert Bresson character in the wrong movie.

I also agree with most of people here, way too much exposition. When Tessa Thompson started to explain the biology of what was happening, I was done. They could have been more subtle.

However, what really bother me the most was that awful soundtrack. Not only it was lazy(Your main theme is a track by Moderat) but the overall pieces did not fit the movie. I think that's what really created a disconnect between me and the movie. I couldn't stand that guitar rift.",7zqsdy
duxaa8m,"This movie, more than anything else, has really made me examine and question my own self-destructive tendencies. Good relationships, good friendships, good jobs... at several points in my life I've found ways to sabotage them all. Stability and success scare me; neither feels deserved, so I reject them and find a way to undermine them. I think this goes back to my high school days. It was so drilled into me by my peers that I am a piece of shit that I don't ever feel like I actually deserve anything good, even to this day.

I got into a discussion with someone who claimed that the cheating subplot in Annihilation was unrealistic because there's *always* some inciting reason for the cheating and the movie doesn't provide one. I'm here to tell you that an external reason for wrecking a relationship is far from a requirement; sometimes it just takes one partner's willingness to self-destruct.",7zqsdy

dv1wpjm,"I think there's a much bigger tie-in between Lena's affair, the physicists choice, and the conclusion of the movie:  

A major theme is our own self-destruction being part of ourselves. The physicist realizes she does not want to fight the shimmer inside her and accepts the change, and thus her self-destruction is something beautiful. Lena earlier in the film has self-destructed herself by ruining her relationship with her husband. She seeks atonement in the shimmer more than her thirst for knowledge. She finds this thing which does not take sides, it creates, amplifies, and distorts. So I *theorize* that what we see in Lena's narration is partially true. I do believe she found the lighthouse, found evidence of Kane being Shimmer-Kane, and was mimic'ed into Shimmer-Lena, which does learn to be her.  

However, due to unreliable narrator, we have no idea how long this actually took. It COULD have been nearly all of four months. What if.... Kane fought his clone, rejected it, and then ended himself when he concludes hope is lost? This would explain why he was gone so long AND why his clone was ""dumb."" On the inverse, perhaps Lena realized this Shimmer-Lena, without malice, memory, or bias was her vicarious second chance? She spends some amount of time teaching the thing to be more human, but hopefully without as many human faults. When it's ready she chooses a path the alien cannot mimic (there was only one grenade shown). She chooses a form of self-destruction that surrenders to something more beautiful.  
 
She chooses Annihilation.  ",7zqsdy

dvlowyy,"Really liked it but I do wish it had pushed a few things a little further - I'm not sure exactly *what* I wanted more of though. More weirdness throughout the film? Less flashbacks interrupting the mood? Perhaps digging into things a little deeper? Not sure yet.

I took the destruction of Area X not to be caused only by the grenade, but by Area X (via the drop of blood then the doppleganger itself) learning, absorbing, and being infected by Lena's self-destructive streak. The grenade provided the flame, but I figure it was replicating Lena's nature which ultimately destroyed it.

I wish the [hypnosis](#spoiler) from the book had been included - especially with how it related to the title. That was one of my favourite elements from the series... guess it would be hard to represent on-screen though, and I did like how the title was incorporated in the film instead.",7zqsdy

dvml8g9,"On the whole a pretty good film. Really enjoyed the feel inside the shimmer. It was haunting and creepy but still managed to maintain a real beauty and intrege that made me feel quite conflicted. Somewhere I certainly wouldn't want to be but at the same time wished I could experience.

Controversially didn't like the bear. I can see why they added it, some pace and some thrills and the scene itself was good. However I like to imagine nature within the shimmer as adaptable, affected yes, but not so much that a spectacled bear (usually not aggressive or scary) turns into this alien-esk stalker. For me the real fear should have come from within. By this I mean what sets us apart from nature is our self-awarness, our ego. The bear or the deer or the crocodile or the plants aren't scared by the shimmer, it's just life but different. Whats scary for humans is losing that self-awarness, our grip on reality, merging with nature and this is where I wish they explored more. The scene at the beginning where 3 or 4 days had passed and they had no idea was so creepy, but that kind of amnesia wasn't really touched upon again. More signs of the group's that had gone in before and lost their minds. I think it missed a trick here slightly.. or maybe I'm just being hyper-critical and that was never going to be the direction of the film.

As for the ending I liked it. My two cents.. The 'alien' thing in the lighthouse is a reflection (prism), a strange sort of phenomenon I don't think it really matters. I like to think it's learning, a sort of consciousness that mirrors whatever planet it lands on. Anyway the irony is it mirrors humanity and we're so self-destructive that it (the phenomenon that causes anhilation) can't even survive here.",7zqsdy

Not going to resonate with everyone, but as a fan of the sci-fi and thriller genres. I've haven't felt this enthralled by a movie in this vein of genre since seeing the original Alien when I was younger.


I mean honestly, the tone itself was hallucinogenic to the point where the pacing lulled you in as the suspense grew around you. AND THANK GOD the resolution to the suspense wasn't a wasted jump scare like has ruined this thriller genre in past years.

A completely chilling and terrifying ending sequence that literally had my brain moving in overtime to try and figure out what the fuck I was witnessing.

I literally sat there enthralled as I tried to figure out the meaning of it all. When it was all over I literally could only say one word.

Phenomenal",7zqsdy

The scene in the lighthouse was stellar to say the least, one of the greatest pieces of sci-fi cinema I have ever seen.

Portman's put on a great performance, she really sold me into the way she behaved as she was staring into the light. Like she was completely entranced and in absolute awe and wonder.

dvzbkvg,"There are many people that posit the theory that the clone at the end was acting on Lena's suicidal urges and thus chose to destroy the nest. 

I don't actually see it that way. If you rewatch the scene, the clone's arms are still on fire and it instinctively reaches out to Kane's corpse in an attempt to find a new genetic factor so it can take a new form. Then it stumbles into the wall and sets the growth there on fire. 

Now the fire builds and the clone realizes that it's in dire trouble. It's instinct is to survive so it returns down to the hole and to the altar. It's crawling, fighting to return to the place of its birth, somehow believing that it will be able to save itself. Of course, all it does is spread the fire further. ",7zqsdy

duqbsjc,"Next question for me, not sure if dumb or not:

What was the point of creating a seemingly identical copy of the people that went in? The shimmer seemed to be causing everything to kinda grow into one large interconnected beacon of life, and things were transferring from person to person (tatto, etc) simply from them becoming part of the shimmer, so what value was there to creating an identical copy? To have them enter the real world and further spread the shimmer? I suppose the only successful copy that we personally got to see was the Kane duplicate, and he made his way out into the world somehow, so was that the goal? ",7zqsdy
durxmt9,So what was with the incredibly rapid change with tree girl? Was her deciding she wanted to become part of the shimmer the deciding factor in her nearly instantaneous transformation?

dusl9np,"I had to concentrate really hard so I didn't immediately judge everything against the book, didn't know how loosely based it was going to be. The movie was visually stunning, took some ideas from the original story and really ran with them. I felt like there could've been some more buildup though, from when they enter area x to everyone going mad and the phycologists ""brightening"" scene seemed very sped up and undeveloped. But overall a very interesting sort of new story. Not the masterpiece everyone claimed, but really enjoyed it. Also, never heard of a phosphorus grenade but holy shit, those fuckers are serious.",7zqsdy
dusmna4,"I have a somewhat alternate interpretation of what the shimmer and the alien symbolized. While Lena theorized that the alien didn't want anything, I think it still came to Earth on purpose and was here to basically offer a ""gift"" to humanity. Possibly a way to accelerate evolution on Earth somehow. However, humanity largely rejected this gift when Lena set her clone on fire and burned everything to ash, the fire symbolizing humanity's destructive nature and appetite for destroying everything we don't understand. The alien clone at the end didn't seem to be affected much by the incendiary grenade actually and kind of chose to let everything get burned down when it started touching everything with it's flaming hands. This leads to the very end where I see the possibility that even though humanity tried to reject the gift, the alien succeeded in passing on the gift to humanity, with Lena and Kane essentially being the Adam and Eve of a new evolution of the human race. When the alien let everything burn down, we see it still crawl back into the whole and onto the platform in the middle which might've been some kind of control panel for it to make the shimmer go away since its mission was complete. 

Now I don't blame humanity for rejecting the gift. That guy's intestines was turned into a giant eel crawling around inside of him. I'd pass on a gift too if it meant that happening to me. But again, that's why I think the fire burning everything down symbolizes humanity's nature to destroy what it does not understand. Lena's first instinct was to attack her clone as well despite it not actually doing anything to her at first. Before this movie came out, I did see a lot of people comparing it to Arrival which actually makes sense still for my interpretation. In Arrival, the aliens gave humanity a gift with their language which let gave humanity a new perspective on time, but some people didn't understand the alien's intention and nearly rejected the gift completely. ",7zqsdy
dusmtrr,"I just realized the similarities between this movie and the premise of the now cancelled Syfy TV show Defiance. In that show, aliens arrived at Earth with the intent to terraform the planet before realizing that it was already inhabited by humans. Through some accident, the terraforming technology was released uncontrollably all over Earth causing wild mutations in pretty much every species on Earth similar to the ones caused by the shimmer in Area X. 

It makes me think that aside from the other theory I've posted, the alien might've been here to actually terraform the Earth to an environment more suitable for its species. For all we know, that alien might've been some autonomous drone or AI sent to Earth to oversee the terraforming process. That's why it's been said the alien didn't want anything, wasn't good or bad. It was just here to change the Earth. Though for the current inhabitants, it wouldn't have necessarily been a good thing. But the fact that the shimmer was constantly expanding does mean that it would've eventually covered the entire world thus achieving terraforming anyways. ",7zqsdy

duwmww4,"I overall really enjoyed it. I'm on board with anything Alex Garland does in the future. Random thoughts I've had:


-This movie really excelled in it's quiet moments. I loved the sparse design in scenes where Lena was just exploring and learning (the scene with the deer, the first moments in the lighthouse), as well as scenes where characters were simply talking (Lena and Shepard in the boat)

-Other than the climax, I think it was less effective in it's louder, more exhilarating moments, though this is partially because most of them were used for the trailer and I knew when to expect them. I feel like the down moments were given room to breathe, but most of the bigger moments were not given the proper room to build tension

-The pillow-talk scene between Lena and Kane was my favorite scene, and I think it was one of the more genuine ""in bed"" moments I've ever seen in a movie

-Anya's freakout didn't feel completely earned to me. There was the one moment where she was resentful of Lena not speaking up and choosing to go deeper to get out, but I feel like they needed one more thing to really sell it.

-The ""trunk shot"" from inside the gator's mouth was amazing

-Things I was reminded of at various points: Halo: CE (the found video footage), 2001: A Space Odyssey (the trippy vision), Under the Skin (the faceless creature), The Last of Us (the parasitic nature)

-Natalie Portman is great, and now I really need to rewatch Black Swan

-I like that they planted the idea of the tattoo but then let the viewer pick on the specifics of it forming and moving around

-I'm a big fan of the act-break cards. They were also used in Ex Machina, but they're use here was more interesting because there were harder lines between the sections, as opposed to the more natural ""Session 1"", ""Session 2"" in EM

-I thought it was interesting that the interrogation revealed information early, which reframed dramatic questions in the Shimmer from (for example) ""will they make it to the lighthouse"" to ""what happens when they get to the lighthouse""",7zqsdy

Terrence McKenna argues that mushrooms might travel through the universe as spores, waiting to make contact with nervous systems like our own. 

He believes that humans gained language by consuming psychedelic mushrooms. 

I've read things here where people refer to this thing as a fungus. I think the shimmer, and the alien presence could be some kind of fungal entity and still be conscious. Even though Lena says it wasn't aware of her; didn't know she existed, it might still be offering a doorway for evolution. Like, psychedelic mushrooms don't necessarily need us or know we exist, but they act upon our bodies in very profound ways. Same thing with the shimmer. It afforded an opportunity for humans to shed their most base aspects, like self-destructiveness. And those who accepted became changed. Possibly evolved. ",7zqsdy

dvc1hqm,"Here were a few of my thoughts on this movie:

The parallel between the introduction of Lena's character and Kane's character felt like it was alluding to parallels of their journey in the shimmer. [Which is strange because the reason for Kane answering ""I don't know"" is because he is a clone.](#spoiler) On a similar note [why does Lena answer I don't know to the questions at the beginning when she seems to remember all the way to the lighthouse burning.](#spoiler)

The other thing is Lena [as an unreliable narrator. We see that she hides the fact that she knows Kane dies. We also see her character throughout the movie lying; whether it was to Anya and Josie about going to the shore, or to her husband with the affair. Originally, I thought it was implying that the third act was a lie, but I'm not sure if we are seeing the movie through her storytelling, or if they are just flashbacks, if that makes sense. The reason I went down that rabbit hole was because I felt like she was a clone at the end, but after reading some comments here and sleeping on the idea, I think I am wrong.](#spoiler)

While the final shot here added a different element with the shimmering eyes, I feel it didn’t go far enough. The ideal ending for me would have been to transform natalie Portman’s face into say either ventress’s face or have it be a collage of all the faces. To me, that would have been a more powerful shot considering we saw her first as Natalie Portman and then it pays off in a more meaningful, horrifying way just why everyone is wearing biohazard suits and looking scared shitless throughout the movie.

Since she already had a transformed tattoo, why not take it a step further and have her change over the course of the interview? Another added benefit is it justifies why you needed to show that she got away from the shimmer in the beginning. Rather than undercut the stakes of the movie, you actually ramp them up with a final shot of her transformed.

Though they are different, this isn't as good as Ex Machina, which worked much better as a cohesive whole. This film had some structural issues that caused some hiccups in the storytelling (like some of the flashbacks and music choices).

While me may not know the exact nature of the disturbance our movie going brains can simply file under “weird alien shit.” If that wasn’t clear enough there’s plenty of exposition throughout to bring you up to speed, though precious little research is done and people’s roles seem arbitrary. 

People say the book is unfilmable but there was plenty in it that would have trainsitioned just fine.
The hypnosis for instance or the gradual realization that the red dots do nothing.

While the imagery on screen could hardly be called generic the beats and rhythm of the movie definitely were.

Not to mention each time it felt like it was getting in gear we got a totally pointless flash back that deflated the whole operation again.

Side note. Keeping a perimeter watch by sitting inside one lit up bunker in the middle of a dark field seems pretty dumb.

Some of the dialogue had to have been forced on Garland surely?

duq93j8,"First off: that fucking bear am I right?

I have skin of diamond studded leather when it comes to film; Irreversible and Evil Dead (the new one) just kind of rolled off.

But man that bear scene hit some serious scared-monkey-in-the-jungle buttons for me.

Moving on: I really liked this film. I thought some of the dialogue, plot and characters were a little rougher than Garland's other movies. Which might be issues with the source material, not sure. But I felt it added up to much more than the some of it's parts.

Ironically, I got the vibe that both Garland and the Vandermeer didn't really understand their own stories very well. Though they frequently try to visit the ideas of self destruction, the plot doesn't seem to actual reflect this in anything but exposition alone.

To me, the movie is about trauma. And the way that the need to heal drives us toward unforeseen consequences when we attempt to salve our own pain. Consequences that change us into new people, not necessarily destroy us. 

The fear of change seems to resonate a lot stronger for me, as the characters never seem really damaged enough to want to self destruct. But what they are willing to do is take bold risks to change who and what they are. 

To me the fear of watching a decision you've made change you in ways you didn't expect, works much better as the metaphorical pretense for a lot of the films plot. 

I also liked how it was unclear if the protagonist was or was not the original that went in. There is a single scene that made me wonder if that she was, in fact, in Kaiser Soze situation, either intentionally or unknowingly. 

The movie is not necessarily what happened in The Zone... err sorry, my mistake, The Shimmer. It's the story of what happened. And in that story when they find the town before reaching the lighthouse, she remembers the house as her house; the one from the beginning of the film. 

Which suggested to me that her memory could in fact be artificial or contain hallucinations. It's unclear. 

In truth I think though there were themes the authors were thinking about, the story that actual came out of the screen at me was a lot different. It felt a lot more like Silent Hill in certain moments, and I was glad that the exposition never really told you what you were seeing overtly; it just kind of hinted at the concepts in play and not their literal nature.

The line that really got me was; ""It's really two bereavements. Mourning the loss of my little girl, and the person I once was.""

Boots are now a brown/black colour and some outfits are different but not overtly noticable. When Kane is refracted in the end scene he becomes a version of himself from before he entered.

dv68yk3,"I think Carl Jung's theory of ""individuation"" produces the richest viewing of this movie. I wrote an essay's worth a week ago and have since seen the movie again. It's incredible, especially the third act, which is a rapid 1:1 imagining of Jung's understanding of the Shadow. As soon as Lena turns on the camera in the lighthouse you're immediately flashed with archetypal images, the ""appearance of the Shadow"" during the recording (the faceless man looking down at, presumably, Kane, as he's emerging from the depths), Kane's ""encounter with the Shadow"" up until the end of the recording, Ventress' ""merger with the Shadow"" down in the depths of the unconscious, culminating in Lena's ""enantiodromia"" back up into the light of consciousness which initiates the ""assimilation of the Shadow.""

Enantiodromia: ""the tendency of things to change into their opposites, especially as a supposed governing principle of natural cycles and of psychological development.""

It's as if Garland was reading the wikipedia page on Jung's Shadow and thought to himself, ""what would this look like in a sci-fi movie?""

Another theory is that at the end it's the clone that survives. The whole movie we are shown that Lena is a liar. She cheats on kane. She lies about knowing kane. She lies about taking the best way out is through the lighthouse. Just like the bear could absorb the sounds of it's victims, and how kanes clone could absorb memories it isn't to far fetched to think the clone could absorb her ability to lie.",7zqsdy

That being said, I think the movie did an excellent job of capturing the overall theme and tone of the novel. I think that the changes they made for the movie were for the most part very good and necessary. The story as presented in the book would have been extremely difficult to translate to film. Overall I really enjoyed the movie.

One particular scene that stood out to me was when Anya was looking at her hand and could see her fingerprints changing, and then she brings that up in her whole meltdown. One of the predominant themes in the movie is the breakdown of personality. The shimmer fundamentally changes everyone on the expedition. We're taught from an early age the importance of our fingerprints, that this is something that is unique only to us, that they're a permanent part of who we are and that nobody else has had or will ever have the same fingerprints as us. I think her seeing that change is losing a part of what makes her ""her"", and that's where we really start to see her lose her grasp of herself.",7zqsdy

Edit: This has also been really bugging me but as a side note I feel like the shimmer is conceptually similar to the Zone in Tarkovsky's Stalker. Granted they work differently but that was one of the things that came to mind.",7zqsdy
dvmy6hh,"I really liked the movie. I feel like there are several themes going on but most of them are already mentioned.

The bear scene and the doppelganger were the best parts for me.The music was trippy, especially in the lighthouse part.
Also, someone in this thread mentioned that Alex Garland is a gamer, so I wondered if the similarity between the
hole in the lighthouse and the dark sign from Dark Souls intentional or just me imagining things. [image](https://imgur.com/a/fuRsQ)

Anyway, can't wait to watch it again.
I feel like I missed a lot of small details.",7zqsdy
dvnmofr,"Saw it last week. The more I think about the movie, the more I feel fascinated and creeped out. Here are some thoughts/questions that haunt me:

1-Was [Lena infected](#spoiler) even *before* entering the Shimmer?

The movie only told us vaguely things got scrambled via refraction, but not how exactly it works. All we can assume is it takes a) some alien/contaminated substance nearby, and b) light refracting, to initiate the process.

[Then I realized the first time these two conditions were met was way before Lena embarked on the mission: it was back in her house, when she reunited with her husband. First, fake Kane was the alien substance; he even spat blood--remember it always began with mutated blood cells? Also, light distortion took place--wasn't he sort of ""warped"" back home despite the house being outside the vicinity? So what if the Shimmer only serves as a magnifier, or some catalyst? What if mutation happens as long as there is refraction, which is basically everywhere, only much subtler and slower outside than in the Shimmer?](#spoiler)

If the theory is true, I feel it might add extra weight to the glass scene in the end. [Wong's character geared up as if to deal with some airborne-disease, but protective suits or not, the light still went through.](#spoiler)

2-[The skeletons](#spoiler) in front of the lighthouse.

This one I'm not so sure. [When Lena first got to the beach, every torso there was put upside-down, with its pelvis pointing skyward. After defeating her doppelgänger, there was a brief shot of the skeletons, and they seemed to be arranged correctly.](#spoiler) I could have remembered it wrong though.

Edit: screwed up one of the spoiler tags",7zqsdy

dvrclf4,"Saw this last night. Loved it. What Sci-Fi should be. Interesting ideas that linger with you a while after seeing it. The whole concept of DNA refraction was something I never though/seen before.

In the beginning when they first enter the shimmer, the next scene is Lena waking up in her tent. I thought ""WTF that is weird editing"" then Cass asks Lena if she remembered even setting up camp. Crazy..",7zqsdy
dvrykbs,"I feel like reading the book in anticipation of the movie ruined the latter for me, as I had an underlying expectation that the adaptation would be more heavily faithful, but I understand that not all things literary can be coherently and sensibly adapted to the screen. There are others who've already commented on the differences between the two at length, so I'll not say more. It's not to say that the movie is bad by any means. It's well-done and well-acted.

The one thing I did roll my eyes at was the beginning, when she said something like ""these are cervical cancer cells"". I'm a pathology resident and cancer cells under microscopy don't look like that, nor do mitoses happen that quickly and neatly (cancer cells have some of the ugliest mitotic figures). Also, medical students don't learn things at that slow of a pace. It's more like ""We're learning the Krebs cycle in the next hour. Know it by the end of this week because you'll be tested on it Friday."" I know it's not real, obviously, but it's one of those ""medicine is never represented correctly on TV"" sort of things.

TL;DR - Just watch the damn movie.",7zqsdy

If anything I think Lena's tattoo is evidence she was the original. Anyone notice if her clone had it? For all we know though, they were all cloned when they blacked out after the first night. I think the husband was definitely cloned though since he spontaneously healed.

dv27dq1,"So glad I saw this in the theater. Both it and black panther engrossed me in such different ways.  I saw it during the matinee showing and felt like I snapped out of an acid trip when I got outside in the sunshine afterwards.  A lot of the first 2/3s of the movie gave me the same sense of mystery, excitement and dread that the show lost did in the first few seasons when the characters were exploring the island.  I thought the 3rd act was about to fall off a cliff, but it quickly righted itself with Natalie Portman being mirrored.  I didn't really get why she cheated though.  I guess it was written off as self destructive behavior, but you gotta explain that more when you portrayed them as happiest couple ever before that.  At least it wasn't as confusing as why you'd guard a ground outpost with a lantern  that you all rush down to when you have a perfect tower to keep watch at.  Those are my only nitpicks.  The world they created was great, I loved how they kept stopping to observe and absorb everything and letting the audience do so as well.  Too many other films flash by stuff like that have the characters say ""yep"" and keep passing by.  The score was awesome and helped set the tone.  The acting was great too.  

Very upset paramount essentially flushed it down the toilet, though I hope Netflix turns it into a cult classic.  I actually tried to see it opening Thursday and none of the theaters here even got it in. My favorite theater and the closest one here didn't even get it this week so I had to drive 5 miles out of the way just to see it today.  So of course it didn't do well in the box office.",7zqsdy

The exposition was clumsy throughout the film.

The Cambridge postdoc was caught saying that The Shimmer was scrambling radio waves via refraction.

Actually, refraction has nothing to do with scrambling EM-waves, and has everything to do with doing exactly the opposite.

What a pointless attempt at mixing in some science, only to make the movie dumber. Kinda ironic.

There was no proper character building, their motivations were not mediated well, and it felt like you could cut half of the characters and not affect the film at all.

A lot of the acting was also subpar. Tuva Novotny can be given a pass because English isn't her first language (she acts pretty well in Norwegian).

I really did not like this film. What a step down from Ex Machina, which actually had a semblance of meaning and relevance.

The shimmer, the trek into it, all of that is there to explore the idea of self-destruction, and looking at how we self-destruct the further we evolve. I'd suggest taking those ideas into a 2nd viewing and start analyzing things from a symbolic point of view.

Obviously, everyone who entered the shimmer seemed to be self-destructive in some way (Ventress' illness, Anya's distrust, Josie's self-harming, Lena's affair, and I can't pinpoint one on Shepherd but I'm sure it's there).

It was very atmospheric and had excellent set and creature design but I was a little disappointed that most of the cool designs were spoiled by the trailers. It left little to be surprised with. Another thing that disappointed me was the lack of good dialogue. Infant the movie has very little dialogue at all and what is there barely fleshes out the themes of the setting of the movie. Was it intentional? Maybe but I felt like there was a lot of missed opportunity. 

Another minor thing was what the fuck was with the ambient guitar beats in the real world scenes? The real world scenes felt sterile and dull yet it had warm guitar riffs that felt tonally confusing. In fact most of the music (with the exception of the cool synthesized inorganic beats from the last 20 mins) felt wildly out of place. ",7zqsdy

I understand the diversion from the book. In particularly, the bear/boar and alligator were great, compelling scenes. Part of the ending - the mirror dance, was, indeed, fitting and kind of horrifying. Part of it - the psychologist hitting, for the 1000th time, the annhilation/cell division talking point was less great. 

The big problem, and maybe it's expextations, but the lack of tower/tunnel and crawler meant a coherent, focused question for the crew to tackle was absent. Also the most interesting setting, which is pretty important.

More subjective - I thought the characters were less interesting and playing less against each other and their profession. Pretty much one note and done imo. Didn't need the movie affair and realyl missed the tidal/pool metaphor for the biologist. 

Music was great, cinematagrophy/art direction was pretty good, though a little too overtop at parts. ",7zqsdy

Sure the dialog between the protagonists was a little bit minimalistic.And maybe they could have added 1 or 2 more action scenes with bigger mutations,but then again that would have maybe messed up the overall atmosphere of the movie.But can you really totaly dismiss a movie which has so many different things going on for it (sound,atmosphere,visual fidelity, the openess for viewer interpretation) just because the dialog between the characters was minimalistic?I can understand that people who mostly like action focused sci fi movies like terminator 1-2 , alien 2 or even star wars dislike this movie.

And i also dont think it helps the movie that everybody calls it a ""thinking piece"", because it just raises unfair expectations in that way that everybody who does not resonate to this movie gets then into the mood of attacking the movie and calling it pretentious or style over substance, because his mind comes to the conclusion:""If this is a thinking piece and i do not like it...am i then stupid or what"".So it really does the movie no favor at all, hyping it up as ""thinking piece"". Just take it for what it is.

I would rather see it as kind of sci fi rorschach test, if you have to make any analogy at all.

Thankfully most people seem to like it judging from the scores on sites like metacritic. Which of cause does not mean that something is wrong with you if you do not like it.

The writer and his novel re purpose already well explored serious Science Fiction setting, and quite probably do a lot of... homage to such previous works, to put it nicely. 

Or actually shamelessly steal other writers ideas and put a bit of his spin on it.

From famous brothers Strugacky novel that inspired the Tarkovsky Stalker movie and games to Ian Mcdonald Chaga novels. And its probably inspired a lot by works of Stanislav Lem. (there are other there too, a lot)

But, all in all it was a decent movie to see. Definitely not a Hollywood mass product and that was a bit refreshing as it lacks all the usual cliches.

It satisfies both on the narrative and visual levels. Which is rare.
And it also shows that such a movie can be done with mostly female cast, if anyone needed to be convinced about that - when its not forced and when all the crucial parts are decent or good, instead of bad, lousy and stupid. 

As for the alien thing, my opinion is its definitely not intentionally or even consciously antagonistic, and is a good example of Strugacky-Lem kind of alien life forms - as in - truly alien, unknowable.
Almost or completely impossible to comprehend by humans. (note that Lem for example doesnt just leave it at that but expertly and masterfully explains exactly why that would be in every novel he wrote, which is why he is considered a master of Science Fiction)

The effects the alien creates in the Zone made it seem like its simply trying to understand the completely alien life forms it encountered on this planet.

And thats a nice trick, since we would be completely unimaginable and incomprehensible aliens to it.

So all its doing is trying to rebuild and understand this weird form of life it encountered. To even understand what are plants or animals, or are we all connected or separate, - hence the mutations. Experiments.
It doesnt know if people are separate from plants, or what are these things  we call cells and what does that do when twisted and changed this or that way.

It could be that the alien is a sort of micro-nano organism that functions only on the level of dna or lower so all of the macro world is complete unknown to it and something it cannot even fathom.
Although after several years of trying to understand where it got to... it apparently got to some stage where it figured out there are these weird macro-biological entities, animals and people - hence the first human dopplegangers - clones and not outright killing everyone.

I mostly liked it. Despite some details being skipped over because movie-plots... but the rest makes up for it, especially the finale.

- This film deserves to be scene in the theater. From the visuals to the sound mixing...Some really incredible visuals from the plant species, the human-plant hybrids, the deceased humans turned plants (especially that one guy in the pool...). The lighthouse/beach set with the crystal towers...amazing.

- The lighthouse scene and climax...edge of my seat. Wasn't sure what to expect or the result

I loved it, though I don't think it's quite on par with *Ex Machina*, which was probably my favorite film of 2015.  It's a movie that I think will stick with me visually. The details just grabbed me in a way visual filmmaking often doesn't, from the wall of flowers outside the shark-odile hut to the crystal trees outside the lighthouse to the mutated man in the pool.  The tape of Oscar Isaac cutting into the other guy's stomach was among the most disturbing scenes I've experienced (I don't fuck with parasites, things living inside people get to me).  And the bear was awesome.    The performances were all pretty good, and I thought the highlights were the actresses I hadn't seen before (Novotny and Rodriguez).  Portman, Isaac, Leigh, and Thompson were all good, but I feel like I've seen better from them.

Also, the significance of Ventress not having ""eyes"" and then when Lena appears, (and to some affect, is kinda amusing) she turns and is like "" oh hey, Lena"" but with both her eyes intact.

Thoughts?

For a general audience, what Annihilation brings to the table is something different. I'm hoping the movie will draw in more people to read the books.

As a fan of the book (more specifically, Authority followed by Acceptance), I'm exceedingly distraught that my two favorite characters have little to no chance of showing up now. If Authority was going to be in the works at some point or another, Annihilation certainly did what it could to kill that chance. No Whitby. No Grace. No Control.

And no crawler?? No living words on a breathing, living wall. No descent into darkness. I'm so distrought guys you have no idea. The crawler and the words could've been there without a need for an explanation. 

A+ for the moaning creature though. Without the connection to the other books, what they did with it and how they represented it was a strong and powerful choice. I don't think the big screen has seen anything like it. Definitely my favorite part.

Spoilers - I read the books and liked them and also liked the movie but didn’t understand or like the conclusion with the phosphorous flair and that creating a “chain reaction” that wiped out the infestation. Why did the clone take the flair? Why did it look metallic? Why did it just let her leave the lighthouse? Why did that result in all the contamination self destructing(this made the least sense)? I can make up some causes but this conclusion to the shimmer didn’t seem to follow the rules that had been setup throughout the rest of the movie.

dus1evn,"SPOILERS

So many questions, but primarily, I don't understand why were duplicates created and what was the mechanism? We saw the alien trying to duplicate the biologist, so was there another alien who was successful in duplicating the husband? What possible purpose could be achieved by transforming into duplicates of humans who reach the lighthouse? Why was the psychologist not duplicated, since she also reached the lighthouse? Maybe this could be explained by the fact that the duplicate would also have cancer and so die immediately. 

I see the shimmer as either a defence mechanism or an inherent property of the alien, maybe subconsciously projected out which mutates living organisms at the genetic level and thus causes all the weird stuff inside the shimmer.  ",7zqsdy

I've got some questions. But the one burning question that I'm trying to puzzle out is Kane's hair. Kane-Kane has fluffy, curly hair. Pseudo-Kane has slicked back hair. The scene where Lena is in bed and Kane comes to her to tell her he needs to leave a day early, presumably his leaving for the Shimmer mission, he's got slicked back hair. And he also seemed very flat, much like how he was when he returned.

Couple nitpicky questions though: if you find an elevated sentry tower, why would you perform guard duty at ground level? Is there any logic to this that I'm unaware of?

And how can a scientist who has agreed to enter an area as mysterious and obviously ""out there"" as Area X insist that giant moving intestine worms must just be a trick of the light?

In this case Lena and Kane made it and now altered (or maybe rather gentically updated) go on to bring new life (if the military lets them of course).

Edit:

I would definitely argue that [the lighthouse] is some kind of goal or at least a destination. The hole in the lighthouse is without doubt intended to be the entrance to a ""vaginal cavity"" with an ""uterus"" at its end. What happens there is some kind of a fertilization (blood sample of Lena and the alien ""egg"" made of organic material of the unit's captain). Kane went through the same process and both emerge with reborn/altered versions of themselves through the opening of the hole. 

However, Lena seems to be able to ""beat"" her copy with the phosphorus granade, Kane didn't and killed himself since he couldn't cope with the situation. Therefore, the best possible Lena (maybe still genetically altered by the shimmer) and the best possible Kane made it back ""home"". Survival of the fittest ;)

Furthermore, all members of the female and male exploration team came in with a variance of properties and had therefore different odds of survival (someone else mentioned the tendency to self-destruct what could have created different odds).

Nothing in this movie made sense. Not a damn thing. But it was really, really pretty to look at and the score was one of the best I've heard in a long time.

Soooo... this thing has been slowly growing in size for 3 years and no one knows about it. They had to evacuate a town but still, no one knows about it. 20 satellites overhead and the Russians and Chinese don't have a whiff of it.

3 years and countless expeditions in that never come back. No samples of the life inside, no images, nothing. Because... no one's ever tried just putting steel harness and cables on people so they can walk a few feet in to get samples? No one's tried an air drop directly to the lighthouse? You're telling me 'the shimmer' is inpenetrable any other way in?

The stuff inside the shimmer gets mutated to the point where one biologist can see the changes easily with a cheap, portable microscope. Yet the Kane imposter walked out (and somehow made it home despite no explanation as to how he got past a tightly secret military operation and guards) and they've been testing him for months but haven't discovered he isn't human?

The Kane imposter is sick- so let's send 4 scientists in with absolutely no protection. No suits, no masks, and let's touch everything! Because Prometheus made money, right!! A fucking biologist is walking up and touching plantlife talking about how it's mutated and changed with no protective gear whatsoever.

dv000rd,"Hated this film so much it's hard to know where to begin.

-This script felt like it was written by someone who had never heard humans communicate. So much dumb/shitty/obvious dialogue. An example is when Tessa Thompson characters goes like ""This place has been long-abandoned"" or something like that. Who even says that? There's like 50 examples of this but I didn't care enough to try to remember them.

-Could they get people that weren't complete fucking psychos for this mission? Was there no one else more mentally balanced to volunteer? Given the stakes, I'm guessing the government could've picked from a million more emotionally-stable people to go in. Wouldn't you pick better people for this mission? They even mention that they're 'damaged goods'. Okay, the fate of the world depends on this fucking Suicide Squad.

-Tessa Thompson's character just going ""fuck it, i'm becoming a tree"" scene was hilarious. Such a dumb ending to a dumb character. She added pretty much nothing to the plot and her only big discovery was something that Portman's character probably knew anyways. Fitting end to her character.

-Fucking Gina Rodriguez. Like, what an idiot. I get that they're scared and shit, but literally one guy out of hundreds ever made it out alive of the shimmer. You're going to volunteer to go in and then shit yourself at the first sign of trouble/death? Her 'fuck it i'm out' scene was so dumb & cliche. Also, her reaction to the video was stupid. Some guys insides are clearly becoming a fucking monster, ""yup, that's a light trick"". Like what, are you blind?

-The sleeping security guard lol. Oscar Isaac is the only survivor from this mysterious alien pseudo-invasion and this is they best they have? That room would be locked down with 24/7 security. It would be more secure than Fort Knox. Portman just walks in to the unlocked door next to the sleeping security guard. It was like 28 Weeks Later when an entire zombie apocalypse is started by hilariously-shitty security.

-What happened to the whole ""losing track of time"" thing that they introduced literally the second they went into the shimmer? It would have been cool to keep exploring that concept. Instead, they just mention it once and it's completely forgotten about. When Portman mentions ""we've been travelling for 6 days now"" later in the film. Like what the fuck? We can keep track of time now? The first part of the shimmer didn't happen?

-They had a perfect spot to camp out in that guard house, above everything with a perfect vantage point of the whole base. Instead, they send a single non-combatant to guard a random shed at the bottom? Are you shitting me? These idiots deserved to get eaten by a mutant-bear.

-Related to the above point, Leigh's character is plotting their next move? Like, you guys didn't even fucking plan where you were going to go before going in? Months went into prepping the mission and nobody thought ""huh, where should our main characters go?"". They always had the map, they only started using it once they went into the spooky alien wasteland?

-What was up with the whole cheating storyline? What did that bring to the story exactly? Also, that post-sex scene was so fucking dumb. ""This is never to happen again, I hate you, my husband knows"". So why were you two fucking 20 seconds ago. Also, that guy's line delivery of ""does he know about our affair"" was way too on-the-nose and awkward. No one says that.

-This would make the movie irrelevant so it's not a real complaint but like why the fuck doesn't their mission start at the coast? Like, that would bypass every single problem. It's a straight shot on the beach to the lighthouse instead of going into the deadly, spooky, shit-show of a jungle.

-If Portman is telling them the entire story, wouldn't they know that Oscar Isaac is some kind of alien-clone-human-monster? It's mentioned in her story that the real one kills himself. So they're just letting them interact with each other knowing 100% that one or both of them is a possibly dangerous alien? 

There's so much more but I'm tired & disappointed. Easily the biggest disappointment of 2018 so far for me. Really let down.

dvqk9xg,"I know I'm a bit late but what an incredibly thought provoking film!

I feel like the film is about not being able to escape from yourself.

Shep is killed by the bear and is trapped in the bear. The physicist always wants to be accepted and fit in and ends up blending with nature. The alcoholic can't control herself but always needs to feel in control. So when she ties up the others to feel in control, she is also killed by the bear. Lena is a cheater who self destructs. Even when she makes it out and can be free, she chooses to self destruct.

Also, I think the person at the end is definitely Lena. She made it but she couldn't escape from her own flaws and ended up with the alien thing at the end. Then, she became the alien.

While its nowhere near the quality of Ex Machina, it was refreshing to watch nonetheless.",7zqsdy
duqhyfs,"Maybe I misinterpreted it, but I thought the movie was a metaphor for self destruction. Not as much on a global level or how humanity is slowly killing itself, but internally, and how we each suffer from our own anxieties.

Each of the five characters, as Shepard explains in the canoe, is dealing with something (addiction, loss, cancer, etc.) and are willing to embark on this “suicide mission” not only because each of them are qualified in their own specialized fields but because they are each searching for purpose or redemption. All of them are consumed by their own troubles except for Lena.

We see this when en the bear begins roaring “help me!” with Shepard’s distorted vocals. It’s later explained to us that  because The Shimmer refracts even DNA that the bear must have fused with Shepard as it was mauling her, and thought that the movie was suggesting that she was overcome by her grief.

The Lighthouse sequence I thought most clearly explained this as Lena sees that Kane was replaced and she has to face The Alien who is mimicking her. For the entire movie she’s confused over her husband and longs for something more than her broken marriage (I thought it was a great touch when Lena sees the two deer, suggesting that perfect love is obtainable even in The Shimmer). The sequence is drawn out to show her struggling with her internal grief. The alien even begins to smother her against the door, and she realizes that the mimic is becoming her so she needs to kill it or she will be replaced.

I loved it and maybe I misinterpreted it, but even in the final scenes through the chaos I was almost brought to tears because of the heavy subject matter. I felt like I was enveloped in the sound. It was an absolute sensory overload that made for an incredible experience.",7zqsdy
duq3l1q,"I thought the last 20 minutes of the film were incredible, and I wish the rest of the movie reflected it more.

I think the Shimmer needed to be pushed even further. They just showed us florals, a crocodile shark, some pretty deer, and flower shaped humans. I wanted to see a living, mutated human. The bear creature was great, but even then, they ruined the explanation of it by saying it captured the anthropologist's last emotions (that's not how DNA scrambling works, whatever that means?!) Why not just have it be that it eats other organisms vocal chords?

I thought a lot of the dialogue was weak, outlandish, and awkward. I was insulted by the scene where the swedish anthropologist points at the other girls and lists their faults - as if humans could be boiled down that simply. The performance from Leigh was so empty and without explanation. 

Also, if Lena destroys the shimmer at the end, wouldn't Kane 2.0 die too?

The many plot holes and weak characters ruined the greater premise for me.",7zqsdy
duqtxr6,"My theory of what the ""shimmer"" is:
Seems like it is similar to the sphere in... well, in the book _Sphere_.

The ""sphere"" would manifest the subconscious thoughts of anyone who entered it. And it seemed to me that this might also be happening when various people enter the ""shimmer"".

(And my apologies in advance for being terrible with names. Hopefully the job descriptions will be adequate here.)

At one point, the psychologist mentions something along the lines of ""this started with [her] and will end with [her]"". Maybe her subconscious thoughts were focused on her cancer when she first encountered the shimmer... which caused the entire shimmer to begin expanding and mutating/corrupting anything and everything around it.

After that, everyone who entered started seeing her manifestations, and then their subconscious would start running wild and manifest more bizarre things.

The anthropologist was spooked that something just tore through the fence... which led to the mutated-bear manifesting and chomping-down on her.

The paramedic starts getting paranoid, thinking the others are all lying to her... which leads to everyone hearing the voice of the [dead] anthropologist. (Like, ""oh, see?! She's not really dead! I knew you were lying about that too!"")

The three that are tied-up are now panicking, hoping that they can get free... which leads to the mutated-bear appearing and attacking their captor.

The physicist buys the theory of the runaway mutations and decides that they will likely all die. Or, rather, she doesn't want to ""face it"" or ""confront it"", so she just accepts her fate... which leads to her walking away and mutating into one of the human-shaped plants.

The anthropologist thinks that she really caused all of this and will be the cause of it to end... which leads to her self-sacrifice and the soon end to the ""shimmer"" effect.

The biologist, after seeing the duplicate mutated-deer and then the duplicate husband, starts thinking that she will be duplicated too... which happens before she leaves the lighthouse.

-I love Benedict Wong's voice. He was a great choice for a character that mostly talks. He's also in the game Prey which you would play if you haven't already. 

-I got Junji Ito vibes from a lot of the imagery in this movie. The guy in the pool in particular looked like something he could have drawn. Additionally the whole concept reminded me a lot of Uzumaki. Being trapped in an area, incorrect perception of time, rapid physical and psychological changes, and the general cosmic horror vibes are all things the two share. 

-The plant people was great in how there were both beautiful and creepy. Having one of the crew presumably turn into one just makes it creepier. Maybe some of the other ones are people from the previous expeditions.

-Is this the first story featuring a lighthouse where the characters never climb it? In fact they do the opposite by descending under it. I feel like that could be an attempt at some kind of symbolism but I may be reading into it too much. 

-My one major complaint would be why they didn't just follow the coast from the very beginning. If you want to get to the lighthouse just enter the shimmer on beach and follow the shore the rest of the way. Seems strange that they entered in the forested area and only made for the coast after they got lost. Maybe there was an explanation that I missed. ",7zqsdy

dvqxx0a,"Lingering questions I have...not sure if these were explained and I just missed it. Or perhaps they are irrelevant in the grand scheme.

* Why does clone-Kane recover from his illness (radiation poisoning?) when the Shimmer is reduced to ash?

* Does the Shimmer require a ""being"" in order to take form and make the ""clones""? For instance, the psychologist seemed to ""give"" her body to the Shimmer and it became the carbon mold/source for the Natalie clone. Did that have to occur for Kane's clone as well?

* Why and how did Shimmer-Kane become sentient? It puzzled me that the two Kanes clearly conversed in the recording (""Find Lena"" ""I will""). Is it safe to assume that with greater time spent in the lighthouse with Kane, the clone eventually just developed a mind of its own? I guess that could be said to have happened to all the animals in the Shimmer (manbearpig, hybrid alligator)?

I read somewhere that the Shimmer refracted not just DNA and physicality, but psychology as well. I buy this, as it helps me understand why Lena made it out while the other women didn't, as she did not have purely self-destructive intentions and was motivated to return to her husband. I also think this may explain why Shimmer-Kane maintained the deep desire from OG Kane to seek out Lena and attempt to rebuild their relationship in the end (initiating the hug). I was not sure how to interpret that embrace upon viewing because the way the camera focused in on Oscar Isaac's eyes made it seem he had a sinister look to me, but perhaps that is just his natural expression? I guess I just assumed Shimmer may have ulterior motives, as it was revealed to be extraterrestrial; although this movie did not seem set up as a typical alien vs humanity kind of film, so probably not.

A lot of the imagery is fascinating but the last 20-30 minutes fell flat for me, personally. It started off intriguing and by the end of it, I just wanted to know what was going on. I was reminded of Arrival, which I felt handled intellectual sci-fi greatly while still being able to convey a message for all audiences.

duuya6v,"I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was visually stunning. I could have watched the humanoid Natalie Portman running around on fire with that haunting trailer music playing, for like two hours. It was so creative (manbearpig was insane). Not as good as Garland's Ex Machina, but very good and I'm glad I saw it in theaters.

My main critique of the movie is its lack of emotional core. Comparing it to similar movies - Arrival, Ex Machina, Blade Runner 2049 - there is a really strong reason to care about the outcome, the fate of the humans involved (and humanity in general), and the hero's journey. I didn't feel at all emotionally invested in Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac's marriage. We don't see much of them enjoying each other's company or get the feeling that they really NEED each other to be happy. They already have spent tons of time apart. 

Natalie sabotages the marriage through her affair. I thought it was interesting that she isn't invested in the affair. She doesn't feel the strong emotional or sexual connection with the colleague; she does it to sabotage/annihilate the marriage, tying in with the themes of self-destruction. However, we never see Oscar feeling hurt or how that affair affected their marriage. 

As a result, I felt nothing when the two are ""reunited"" at the end. I'm not really sure what was lost or gained for the characters emotionally. The marriage can't survive, since the real Oscar Isaac is dead, but I wasn't convinced that is a bad a thing. It's not clear to me whether this was a failing on the part of Portman and Isaac's acting or the script. ",7zqsdy

I really liked the genetic re-writing, but we only got a handful of hits of it:

[- the Shark Croc - v cool

- the duplicated Deer things - meh
- the plant/tree peoples - pretty cool
I wanted way more of this: bugs, birds, small animals](#spoiler)

My problems with this flick were:

[1) They put ""people"" who came out of the Shimmer in quarantine. Okay, but wtf didn't they go in wearing Hazmat suits?
2) The ""all lady"" squad seemed forced - was this adequately explained in the book? Seems like three years into the Shimmer appearance is pretty late in the game to send the first woman.
3) The ""Queen Bee"" ending trope. So Kane could've collapsed the Shimmer by himself; he just happened to set off the phosphorous grenade three feet away from where it would've done damage? Also, not satisfying that the duplicate Kane got better outside the Shimmer when all the Shimmer life suddenly dies.
5) The ambiguous ending - this is why people who like this flick will like it - they can insert whatever meaning they want into the ending -
 ""It's all a prism, mannnnn, like refracting stuff and whatever"" BUT the only semi-logical explanation I can think of is that the Lena being debriefed is actually the Lena duplicate and thus an unreliable narrator, but even that's a thin explanation because the duplicate Kane was so dumb/foreign and Lena seems to have some grasp of what happened in the Shimmer (and also everything else from the Shimmer died).](#spoiler)

I really liked the aesthetic of most of this film, but it's a really slow burn and not a satisfying sci-fi yarn imo. 

Final thought: what was the deal with the infinity tattoo?
[The first time I noticed it was on Lena's arm in the debrief (altho absent from past and present Lena). Then I saw it on the EMT's arm. Then I saw it on the weird fungus corpse in the swimming pool. And later it's on Lena's arm at the Lighthouse. WTF does that even suggest?](#spoiler)",7zqsdy

dvu81nh,"I am flabbergasted by this movie.  
  
Without going into the merit whether scenes were original to the movie or to the director, there are original concepts and ideas which I have never experienced in a movie before.  
  
There is no chronology or preference.  
  
After witnessing Cass' mauled throat, it was a surreal experience to hear her screams of agony and help. For a moment, I believed that the Shimmer had a paranormal manifestation to it, too. Enter the boar-bear. It projects Cass' voice. In my mind it screams more than simply genetic absorption but sentient feelings, as well.  
  
Kane against Kane. The original Kane must have had a longer relationship with his doppelganger as the latter could formulate perfect English speech whereas Lena's double was only able to properly reproduce her body. Was Kane's double aware that the original was about to commit suicide? Did he feel anything for the other? Are emotions part of the copying? I doubt this because Kane's year-late arrival showed no emotions whatsoever. I even say that the hugs were superficial. Done only to complement the other half of the embrace.  
  
As soon as the girl who used to cut herself started walking away from Lena, the harmony it showed immediately clicked that those humanoid trees were not simply biological restructuring of twigs, branches, leave and flowers. But only at that moment. Initially I thought that she may had done some off-screen cutting which result was the growing of flowers from the resulting welts. After all, she cut herself - always according to Cass' account - to feel alive. Many people associate colourful petals, vegetation and forests with a harmonious nature. She, effectively, become one with nature, certainly alive and entwined as a single organism among the folds of the Shimmer.  
  
The surprising moment a teammate was snatched at the submerged hut. I feared that this scene was about to plunge the movie in the now-is-the-right-time-to-hint-at-an-alien-presence lane. Surprisingly, it was a genetically modified sort-of albino alligator. Furthermore, it shattered the tense tranquility of the team's approach through the area. One moment observing a singular phenomenon of many species of flowers into a single organism then into a heart stopping scene of predator snatching what we might think of a meal. This leads to the last point.  
  
We are unaware whether the alligator was famished and thus hunted for food. However, the same cannot be said about the boar-bear. Cass' remains did not involve missing body-parts only a ripped throat. The lower mandible of the abductee was only removed as it was attacked. I personally believe that creatures sentient to the Shimmer do not require nourishment whereas those who penetrated its barrier do require sustenance. Therefore, those creatures might have only attacked because a new presence in their territory had been observed and needed to establish dominance. An imposing creature might want to further drive its point forward, hence, the second attack of the boar-bear.  
  
That the movie has psychological, biological and philosophical aspects is a no-brainer. The chosen filmography and imagery are what, in my opinion, make this movie stand out in the modern science fiction era.",7zqsdy

There were elements that I loved but between the clunky exposition, poor character development, muddled themes and spotty CGI this ended up being pretty unmemorable which is a shame because I love Garlands work and feel like I am the target audience for these kinds of movies.

Portmans affair being her and her husbands motivations for going into Area-X was so absurd. A gigantic alien presence is slowly swallowing the earth...we didn't need their relationship to be the driving force. Since he made it the through-line of the movie, the scenes we are given between them never convinced me they had a relationship worth saving and Portmans protagonist just ended up being unlikable by the end.

I also don't buy the concept of our self-destruction being written into our genes. It's only because of our evolution and intelligence that we fail as spectacularly as we succeed. Self-preservation and procreation are the driving force behind all other known life, so that whole theme was a huge misstep. It was so much better when ""Annihilation"" was a self-destruct code word programmed into the crew members, instead of Garlands interpretation of how it relates to humanity.

And that CGI clone looked awful, I'm sorry. It looked as bad or worse than the aliens at the end of M. Nights Signs. I can't believe it came down to a dual with a green animated alien, where she blows it up with a grenade and destroys all of Area-X. Lena and Kane being clones or corrupted by the aliens at the end was a nice touch but felt unearned after everything before it.

dvpj7ow,"When the film’s development began, there was only the first of what would become a trilogy of novels, and Alex Garland adapted it by taking the basic premise and then changing or leaving out everything else. The result is a movie that ~~won’t~~ might not please fans of the source and one that, not yet having any answers for the story’s mysteries from the author, isn’t very good at coming up with its own resolution. There’s well built tension that doesn’t really reach the climax it was seemingly going for, while some of the questions and setup don’t lead to anything at all. This can either be considered smart writing (which makes the viewer think about the movie afterwards) or just poor writing (which relies on the film’s saturated floral visuals and atmosphere to distract from its shortcomings). In any case, Annihilation is worth watching because it’s well made on the technical side of things, some of its visuals really are striking, its enigmatic plot is often captivating and scary, and the performances aren’t bad. It’s just not satisfying at all.

Leaving out the Tower and the psychologist’s deceptive nature while adding in some useless shit like an affair and the copies being metallic aliens...I just don’t get it.

Some praise for the special effects, the alligator and “bear” looked great and were welcome additions to the story, Area X itself was very pretty, and they nailed the look of the Crawler. Soundtrack at the end was awesome too and Portman did a great job as the biologist. ",7zqsdy
duy396z,"Mind blowing....! One of the reasons why I think the concept of this movie is so disturbing to us is because it completely disrupts the way in which we perceive our reality and world, the way we are used to movement and how confusing it is to see other physical entities move in the same way we do. It introduces the idea not of alien bodies, but of alien physics. This movie is scary to us because it disrupts a world order in which we humans are considered the highest, most dominant and complex organism..

This entire movie just made me think about the balance that exists on our planet and the special conditions that surround us that allow us to form such complex organisms and bodies (anything from a tree to a human body). It scared me because I now recognize how fragile everything is. I don't want to call life on Earth a miracle, but it is a miracle that all cells and bodies stay in one cohesive, place. 

Also..how many shapes and movements made up of different elements that we might not be able to perceive through human vision, touch or technology must exist?! ",7zqsdy

Couldn't they have just taken a boat from the shore outside of the shimmer and go up the coast to the lighthouse? That would have made the most sense right? 

They send in more than one team. No one comes back. Maybe take a fast boat in and out?",7zqsdy

dvnqmfj,"Just watched it on Netflix. This was I believe a good movie, but I didn't feel good after finishing it. **Heavy spoilers below, I couldn't for the life of me make those black boxes so be warned!**

I think there were a few very good things to explore in the movie that they just let go. The could have explored losing their memories and the warped sense of time a little bit more. They could have more creatures and places to see. I understand these would change the tone of the movie but them losing days had no effect on themand we only get to see it the first time. Later it happens again but only in scenes with Natalie and again those had no effect. The bear was scary, but what really got me was the sound it mimicked. I didn't like the explanation the tree-girl gave us, I believe the bear adapted to become a better predator once it cloned after killing.

I really wanted to see more of the lighthouse and its surroundings for some reason. Being and experiencing the center of that madness was different and unsettling. I remember an old creepy-pasta about a lighthouse and people losing their minds, I wonder if it has any connection with this story.

I also felt like the Lena that got out wasn't the original one or that she was changed. We already know that Lena was lying while she was interrogated, so maybe she invented/mimicked the story of herself tricking the clone with the grenad, something Lena had just learned about her husband.

Speaking of the husband, why did he get better? Or why did it even get bad in the first place? Maybe some question can't be answered without 'need to happen for the movie to go forward'.

At the beginning, when Kane first reappears in the house, she asks how he got there and he says something along the lines of ""I was at the door, I saw you.""  The woman whose daughter dies alludes to her past self being dead when she loses her daughter as she is now a new person.  It made me think this new Kane wasn't ""created"" in the shimmer, but rather when he was at the door and saw his wife with another man.  This is where the seed for shimmer-Kane was planted and led him down the path towards what he would become and how he ""got there.""

I get that it wouldnt be great for viewers to have the cast wearing hazmat suits for the whole movie, but they apparently don’t bother to even bring gas masks, gloves, or even flashlights. For a team of scientists this seemed wildly unprofessional. Even if they were knowingly on a suicide mission, I’d think they’d want to protect themselves in order to survive as long as possible to conduct thorough research.

dvm2uwh,"Song lyrics from the movie:

They are one person, they are two alone, they are three together, they are for each other.

Pretty much sums it up.  We witness the birth of a new life form, and likely the soon to be dominant life form, on Earth.  It is Lina, Kane, and The Creature.

The Creature seems to be the dominant player in this love triangle moving forward, if they have autonomy at all.  Lina and Kane still exist, but in what way?  I feel that the creature annihilated Kane to a higher degree, although also doing so to Lena.  Maybe in changing her genes to that of The Creature, she will be much more open to love and reproduction with Creature Kane, as it is the programming in all of nature.  She obviously still loves Kane, and maybe now will come to love Creature Kane.  In a way, it really is the best outcome.  She loved him, but wanted him to change and become more.  They both certainly are more now. 

I find it interesting, that we don't know anything about the creature.  But it appears, to me, after becoming sentient, that it yearns for another and does not want to be alone.  Sending Kane outside the chrysalis of the shimmer, to bait his new bride to him.  And it will become more.  Their children, etc.  Maybe this will be an improvement to humanity, as they might act nearly the same, but more logical/loving to each other as they/it can see we are all connected and from the same stock.

I also assume, that this creature/this species will now become immortal, essentially becoming gods.  Will they go for another transformation after all of humanity is colonized?  with billions of lives, coming back together as one?  it would make sense in the prism metaphor.  From white light, to rainbow, to white.  Maybe eventually it will learn how to encompass everything together into one giant organism, after the threat of humanity is resolved.

You are absorbed, fragmented, and hopeful at some point annihilated completely but I think you remain, forever.  Great scifi flick.  If scifi-horror is always an exploration of what we fear, what do we fear in our world that looks like this?",7zqsdy

There are obvious questions that should be asked for the audience, even if some of them don't have answers...Everyone that goes in hasn't come out? (obviously besides Lena's husband).  Sooo has anyone walked in one foot and walked out?  Walked in 10 feet and walked out?  Walked in tied to a rope and gotten pulled out?  No animals come out?  Has anyone stuck their hand in and pulled it out?  Gonna just walk in without hazmat suits on?  Just breath that air in there, completely exposed, no worries?  All these things already take me out of being immersed in the film.

dvo24c0,"I saw this movie with my dad the other night in theaters. I had really high hopes, and although I wasn't exactly disappointed I wasn't overly impressed either. It's a visually stunning film, no doubt about that. But the pacing and the plot leave a lot to be desired for anyone who prefer their stories to have a logical beginning and end. Or at least a beginning and end which is internally consistent with the logic which the film puts forth. 

By the end of this film you're not sure what exactly happened or why, and you're not even sure what this means for the two main characters. I'd like to say that the story is more about the relationship between the main characters instead of what's happening with the phenomenon, but it's not because even that subplot isn't given a decent conclusion of any kind.

There are a number of moments when subpar dialog undermined an otherwise riveting scene, or where poor editing ruined the pacing or symbolism of a scene, but it's a more than competent production. The film tries really hard to do some crazy stuff with the biology within the phenomenon, but its explanation for this is really silly. It's one of those bad science fiction hand-waving excuses to drive the plot, like how learning a new language is somehow supposed to alter your perception of time in *Arrival*, but you've just got to give the film a break sometimes.

Afterwards my dad and I discussed what we had seen and some of the themes throughout, such as the all too obvious cancer references. I later went home to do some thinking and research on the film, and eventually I came to a conclusion that this film (and perhaps the novel too, although I haven't read it) is an adaptation or homage to HP Lovecraft's *The Color out of Space* in which a meteor falls to Earth and begins to infect the local ecosystem and distort reality because it is so vastly alien to anything we understand. In that sense maybe the unexplained and seemingly incoherent plot developments throughout the story are excusable simply because they intend to be Lovecraftian in nature, meaning they are not explained because they cannot be explained. If so, it's a creepy concept yet makes for an often unfulfilling story. That's why HP Lovecraft's concepts are so intriguing yet almost none of them translate to the silver screen well. 

In conclusion, if you want to tell a story you're going to need a plot with a beginning and end that is at least remotely satisfying. Or at least attempt to provide a justification for why the film lacks closure to the plot it itself proposes to the audience. That's what storytelling is, and if all you've got are impressive visuals then stick to making music videos. The last thing we need is someone making art house science fiction films with the competency of Zach Snyder behind the camera. Because that's what visuals without a coherent or competent plot is, right? Why let a film made by Zach Snyder become the bane of your cinemaphile existence while films like this (which live up to the same standard) get labeled a masterpiece which is too smart for mainstream audiences? At least Snyder makes films that produce major profits despite their lack of a plot.

duvfw2z,"let me take this moment to give my review...  

I *loved* ex machina.  Loved 28 days later.  Sunshine was good.

Im comfortable saying that alex garlands name carries weight with me at this point, which only a few directors can claim.

So I dutifully saw annihilation instead of black panther.

but seriously... I wasn't amazed...  it was kind of lackluster.  Just because something is ambiguous or unpopular does not make it ""smart"".  If anything I object to this characterization because it suggests that it has failed *because* its smart...  though to be fair, to read reviews you'd expect it to atleast be *good*...  had the reviews panned it, maybe I could buy that was the problem.  

I was just missing a purpose to it.  Beautiful visuals, a creature that will haunt a few dreams, but ultimately, it did not have any replay value.  The story was extremely forgettable, I wasnt left ""wondering"" anything about it.  

And while Im typically willing to suspend a lot of disbelief in a scifi, there is a limit where it is no longer making room for the story to happen, as it is just forcing the story to happen...  I dont want to go into more depth because spoilers, but there were so many aspects of this that were just too ridiculous to ponder, relating to the social/military dynamics of the field team and the general management of the operation...  but why was a psychologist seemingly in charge of this entire operation?  

wouldnt you try to tunnel your way into the shimmer?  just build a bridge through it or something?  tunnel?

something so you are protected from the elements and can make a quick and clear path...  Or atleast start building one, so as you send in additional excursions, their first mile can be through that sweet concrete tunnel you built before the shimmer engulfed it...",7zqsdy
dvlgxnp,"As a doctor I would say the movie is a metaphor for cancer. Shimmer is a tumor.

The border to the shimmer would represent the outer border of a tumor. The meteor hitting earth giving rise to the shimmer could represent how ionizing radiation can hit us and give rise to cancer. A tumor is slowly growing, so is the shimmer. Inside a tumor everything is constantly changing and mutating as in the shimmer. Cells in a tumor acquires new abilities and functions in a lot of biological mechanisms to survive ""attacks"" from ex chemoagents or defense mechanisms from the host, as in the shimmer where the different human groups entering the shimmer could represent immune system responses trying to understand and fight it. The plant-woman succombing to the shimmer right after she accepts her fate would represent how people with cancer at some point often accepts death and gives up and often passes away soon after. The clone-Kane would represent metastasis, cancer cells from the tumor popping up in a completely different place/organ. And finally changed/mutated Lena (w tattoo) escaping the shimmer as it is destroyed would be the equivalent of how when a cancer is eradicated, sometimes a few cancer cells are still left that in time can create a relapse. These cells are the thoughest most resilient ones that have survived despite everything, like Lena.",7zqsdy

Top notch acting. I feel like every character had this background that made you remember them. Sometimes in movies where an expedition team goes out, if backgrounds are not solid, I start to muddle them together and not really give a shit when one dies.

The scenery in the pool area was beautiful. I kept trying to soak up every detail of that crazy thing.

That fucking bear scene was INSANE. Stuff of nightmares. And then that younger gal mutating... such a strongly shot scene with incredible acting by her.

The CGI effects were some of the most beautiful I've seen. The environmental was gorgeous, yet you knew it was deadly. I love that Lena made it a point to tell the group that it wasn't all destruction, there was beauty, too. The deer scene (the one from the trailers) had me awe struck.

And of course, the mirroring scene was sick. I love that I don't know wtf it is and what it wants.

The ending was solid, but could have been better, I think. The movie itself was strong throughout the entirety then ended kind of on a small, subtle note.

dw89mhq,"My personal hypothesis about the anomaly:

I think we are actually told the correct interpretation in the movie, loud and clear. The physicist mentions that the anomaly does not block radio, but actually bends it, much like the visible light.

I don't remember from the top of my head what she says exactly, but I think it's something along the lines that DNA is also bent or spliced in a similar way.

For me, this leads the way to my personal interpretation of what the anomaly does: It does work on all kinds of information. Structures of any kind contain information, be it radio waves, DNA or visible light. The anomaly operates on the level of the information itself, and re-shapes structures to represent a ""bent"" image of the information.

In this way, we see salt crystals on the beach, shaped like trees. Or we see an exact copy of Lena's house in the anomaly region. This is because her mental image of her house is information, encoded in the structure of her brain. The anomaly ""bends"" that information to be encoded not only in her brain, but also in an actual physical object in the region.

To me, this is as if we see our universe as a mathematical fractal (complex information). Our DNA, our memories and other means of encoding information are parts of that fractal that modulate the shapes of the fractal to encode some other information. By changing some of the constants of the fractal, we can make it twist and turn, just like a specific Julia fractal whose coordinates we change just a little.

In this way, information encoded in some specific way in one part of that fractal (e.g. the information about the structure of a house, encoded inside a brain structure) can ""bend"" and show up encoded on top of a different kind of structure (e.g. the same information about the structure of a house, this time encoded as a configuration of matter). When traversing the Julia set, similar things occur: One specific pattern that we might recognize as something like a ""star-shaped hole"" might slowly transform into something that is not a ""hole"" anymore, but a ""star-shaped decoration"" of a border of some other structure. The star-shapedness is preserved, it is just encoded in a completely different way.

I'm pretty sure the above paragraph is utter nonsense to people who haven't played around a bit with fractals themselves. And even for most who did. Sorry, I have a hard time putting it into words. If anyone understands what I mean, help is appreciated!

But to underline my point, the movie seems to make more references to fractals. I believe that the end credits flat out show some fractals, and the thing at the center of the anomaly looks to me like some kind of volumetric fractal. Maybe a quaternion, or something like that.

For anyone who doesn't believe me: Just do a video search for ""mandelbulber"" or ""quaternion fractal"" and skip along a couple of the videos. Then compare with what you see in the movie, in the scene where she reaches the center of the anomaly, below the lighthouse.",7zqsdy

Garland does an amazing job of keeping true to the mood of the novel, while changing things to better serve the screenstory.

dv5lwsx,"Okay I'm definitely not the first person to point this out,  but as my friends and I were walking out of this theatre we started thinking it was a Bible metaphor. Then it hit me. Kane. Like Cain and Abel. The whole movie focuses, up to a point, on the idea of self destruction and the destruction of the people around you. Cain was the first murderer, killing his brother Abel, and we see sorts of psuedo-fratricide thoughout the movie. First, with the video of Kane cutting open his fellow soldier-his brother in arms. Secondly, we see the fake-Kane allow the real Kane to kill himself. Lastly, (and this is going off the assumption that its the real Lina at the end of the movie, not an alien), Lina kills her clone. All of these instances are reminiscent of these characters killing a part of themselves, just like killing a brother. However, I feel like this extends to why the movie played out the way it did. Whileits implied that every expedition before ended in the teams losing their minds and turning on eachother, these expeditions were primarily or all men: or brothers. Brother constantly kills brother inside the Shimmer, but not sister. Beyond the turmoil surrounding Linas relationship with Kane, the female expedition we see never turns on eachother in the way that the men did. I just thought this was an interesting thing to note.
TL:DR A good portion of the movie is a metaphor for Cain and Abel and the idea of killing a brother/part of yourself.",7zqsdy

I thought Portman and Isaac’s relationship was just fucking weird. 

Jennifer Jason Leigh’s character bugged the shit out of me. They had to tell me she was terminal so I’d excuse her behavior. 

The obvious always had to be stated. I found that to be fucking annoying. They go in to the military base and it’s like “this is where the people before us must have stayed”. Well, no fucking shit. Then they find the sd card and someone has to tell us what it is. Of course that’s what it is. First encounter with the bear: “there’s something out there”. Ya think? Shit like that just seemed to go on and on up until everyone else died. 

Then Portman and at least two of the other girls were prior military, if I recall correctly. They go check this hut, but none of them have their rifles at the ready. Even after the first attack, they don’t clear shit. They just walk in places and drop their packs. Then they take a tower, but for some stupid reason they do security from a little booth with a light in it, and it’s on the ground. The one chick gets killed by the bear, but when they leave, the chick with the busted pack just keeps hers with the duct tape on it and doesn’t even bother with even taking the tent. Then there isn’t one flashlight among the lot of them. I’m an engineer and always have a flashlight on me; but these people going into an alien environment don’t even have one on their rifles.

I was into the story until the lighthouse where things escalate quickly with little time to react.  I feel like they mightve crammed 5 chapters of whatever book into 10 minutes if screentime.

the fact that a SECOND flash grenade finally blew up the whole shimmer seemed lazy...
like they never tried shooting bullets or bombs into the shimmer? or applying napalm?

What disappointed me was that it wasn't an adaptation of the book I so loved as the movie claimed to be. It wasn't Annihilation.

These were the factors that were too much of a divergence for me.

Subtlety. I felt that the movie was too on the nose. In the book, the differences are just obvious enough to get noticed (like the dolphins with human eyes) and it wasn't until the Crawler or Acceptance that you realised just how alien things are and in a way that accentuated the slow burn of it all. With the movie you have this great big shimmer which kinda diluted the impact of the Boundary.
On that note: no Crawler :(

Some bits were really dumbed down. Honestly I felt that refraction was too simple an explanation for the mutations. Same thing for the psychologist's lack of backstory and Lena's simplified character.

dvy29pf,"After the release of Arrival and Ex Machina, the popular movie community was so starved for an ""intelligent science fiction movie"" [Hollywood-speak for anything not Star Wars or its laser-gun space saga derivatives] that when Alex Garland arrived with Annihilation, everyone lost their minds.

I finally got myself to finish it. Is there a more clever way to say that I found the movie boring? Garland's first film Ex Machina is far superior, by leaps and bounds. No doubt that that movie's critical and commercial success gave Garland the leverage to make this weird little movie.

Conceptually, Annihilation draws from both Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker and Solaris, and both those films, made in the seventies, went deeper into the themes that Annihilation just barely touches and breezes by. Even that aside, it doesn't even work as a competent into-the-heart-of-darkness movie. Not as a good what-lies-beyond movie. Not even as a decent lowbrow shoot-em-up. The payoff is bad compared to the buildup. Hollywood has set the bar for certain types of cinema, such as science fiction, so low that kids these days [and sections of the film reviewing community] jump around just about anything.",7zqsdy
duqvwko,"Disappointment of a film. The visuals are gorgeous but the plot is dumb, they tried to explain the cause of some of the weirdness which in and of itself takes away from it. They changed a lot from the book, which I mean, the book was kind of not my thing either. 

I mean, yeah, it's creative, and some of the scenes are absolutely breathtaking, but they hammer in so much of the cells dividing and cancer metaphors and all that shit that it really spoils a lot of my enjoyment. Of course, maybe going in blind is better, because I knew some of the stuff that was going to happen. 

The bear scene was great, the pool aftermath shot was amazing, and the people shrubs were also good.

Characters were dumb, and dont explain it away with well area x was messing with them. There's a realistic way to portray growing madness and this wasn't it. 

When the team lead said ""Annihilation"" and just started vomiting up golden dimensional space fluid into the air, I decided that was a perfect encapsulation of the film. It thinks it's smarter than it is, thinks that it can get away with weirdness but also tries to explain it, passingly, (which is worse than no explanation), but hey it looks pretty.

Natalie Portman was perfect in it and the wonder/suspense was thick throughout. She could probably kill it in an alien movie and has some Sigourney Weaver vibes.  [The wtfs per minute were off the charts when she reached the lighthouse.](#spoiler)

[The idea that the DNA shapeshifting alien/lifeform was learning and getting smarter even into the end was freaky, starting with the human DNA plants. ](#spoiler)

[The husband when he came out of the shimmer, was part of it and learning more about the system it was in and will eventually reproduce.  It didn't seem like the lifeform could reproduce or create life forms, just change them or copy existing ones.  So it signaled the wife in and will eventually start having shimmer based babies, it also learned how to live outside the shimmer. It seemed the shimmer was an incubator/lab and bringing in people helped it learn, including the psychologist and the married couple. It learned who ran the world and how, then became them to the next phase.](#spoiler)

dvo7vlp,"I only watched half of the trailer because it was clear that this was going to be my kind of movie. I love brooding, surreal scifi that deals with some sort of existential mystery.

Half way through the movie I was really annoyed. The way they approached the problem was completely unconvincing. There is no clear explanation why they aren't trying to study this thing in a more scientific and cautious way. For example, the way they just sort of nonchalantly stepped into the rainbow haze that had swallowed up dozens of people before them was really poorly done. The film has a huge problem with making any of the characters seem real. I think it was a combination of bad acting and bad writing.

That being said, I was completely blown away by the final act. It was very well done. So many interesting and original concepts. It was very disturbing and thought provoking. ",7zqsdy

The path that leads them there is covered in strange flowers (feminine), showcases a vagina dentata (the alligator's mouth) and a duplicated stag. The women themselves are either lesbian, either mourning a daughter or a relationship with an absent man. I won't even ask what kind of cancer did Ventress have, but it's very probable that it was breast or cervicouterine cancer.

This is not a criticism, I feel actually admiration for the visual language employed to symbolize fecundation, aging, cancer, death and birth. It's what most human struggle is about. ",7zqsdy

Lots of horror cliches in the story and dialogue that got annoying quick - mainly all the dumb decisions made by the team.

The good - 


I enjoyed the acting overall.


The cinematography and effects were stunning.

The OK -


I think the ending went over my head a bit due to the non-traditional narrative. It wasn’t bad, it just threw me off a bit.


Some things stuck out as odd even within the crazy realm of the Shimmer, especially at the Lighthouse. Why were there human torsos arranged in the sand? How was another phosphorus grenade magically inside Kane’s burned corpse?


This is a classic horror movie trope - my peeve is when characters abandon training in favor of moving the plot forward. Example - why would the person on watch be on a hut, outside, on the ground with a light pointed towards them? Lena, as a former soldier, should have corrected that immediately.

You kind of got the feeling they were all dead immediately, like how you can tell in a horror film when a character is expendable. Next...

The military being completely senseless. So, no one returned except this one dude and he's infected with some alien disease. With this information the military decides to do the following:

&nbsp;

**A)**Allow a team to enter the shimmer with no protective gear (hazmat) - What if people just drop dead from this ""disease"" the second they cross into the shimmer? Granted it would not have helped them, but they do not have this information yet. I get why they did this, not wanting to cover the actors faces, but they could've come up with some pretext to remove said gear (like realizing they were infected anyway)



**B)**No military backup. We don't like protecting the scientists, were only sending one ex-soldier? Was there some shortage of man power, I thought the event was still in a somewhat early stage?



**C)**Elite military unit kidnaps lena and kane. However, his isolation unit, you know the one set up because he is infected **BY AN ALIEN VIRUS**, is only guarded by one sleepy scientist. What the shit? The scene with Lena just strolling into the containment unit and touching him, was absurd. Could've been done from the outside, with her touching the glass, not much less of a trope anyhow.

What is the purpose of this scene? Is it just there to be a 'racy' scene with Natalie Portman? It doesn't even do anything for the plot. The only thing I could see it furthering, is that she feels lonely and separated from her husband but she instantly regrets it, so she doesn't necessarily feel like she's growing apart from him.

I didn't have anything to make me feel engaged in the movie. The characters, other than Portman, aren't given time to bloom. We're given one exposition scene on the boats to explain the characters' dark past. I didn't care and I wasn't invested in any of the characters. I barely remember their names. None of the characters did much other than Portman and Ventriss. They were just there to be symbols of something and to not make the movie feel empty. 

Also I thought the plot was bad. The symbolism was good but Garland didn't manage to make the rest of the plot work well. How the government approached the shroud is just idiotic. Send in team after team and hope the next makes it? Like come on. And you send in a bunch of scientists without any military escort, without any hasmat suits and without any clue what they're going into. They clearly weren't suited for the job. I understand the symbolism is for them to be broken in some way but there needs to be more than symbolism for me in a movie. Also how the characters behaved in the movie was facepalm after facepalm. Lamps on at night, leaving the tower, tying everyone up because you find out about Kane, going alone after a bear alone. Also the time loss was conveniently not explained,  altough I think I understand the symbolism of it.

The horror was mediocre. The effects were amazing for sure but when I am not invested in the characters and the writing is dumb, then it's hard to be scared and immersed.

The cinematography had its moments but it could have been better. There was a nice use of bright green colors and wide shots at the end. Having said that I could see the green screen behind trees giving it that cgi look that took me out.  The shimmer gave the opportunity for striking landscape shots but a majority of the shot's composition felt stuffed with claustrophobic foliage.  The bear scene was a highlight and the monster design was top notch, cool and frightening. The ending was beautiful and really made this movie more enjoyable for me.

It's safe to say I am absolutely shocked the movie has a 85% on Rotten Tomatoes. 

I was totally with it, from the moment it started. I was interested and I was curious, and the first ""act"" (area x) got my pumped up for the entrance of The Shimmer. Unfortunately, what followed in The Shimmer didn't need the copius amounts of buildup that came previously. It felt as though something was missing that made her motivation to go through The Shimmer enough for me, as an audience member, to care about. That being said, I was still pumped and ready for The Shimmer sequence. 

Visually, it was stunning. I had no issues with the technical side of the film. It is so very rare that I say this, but I thought the fact that it was written and directed by the same person was very apparent. It was as if the director wrote a specific mood, and therefore locked the actors into that mood for each scene. Unfortunately this creates unmotivated actions, confusing and clunky dialogue, and none of the character feel like interesting people with unique personalities. (For example: you as a person do not know something is suspenseful and wouldn't act that way in real life. Think Stanislovsky and the chicken example). 

Specifically the scene where the woman ""wake up"" after not remembering setting up camp. It was obvious the writer wanted humor, and I'm sure if he let the actors (you have Natalie Portman for Pete's same) come up with their own truth for their motivations the movie would've been much more memorable. 

I had no issue with the overall premise, but it felt like a movie that needed desperately to be directed by someone that brought more to the table to bring the story to life. I felt empty when I walked out.

The expository conversations felt like they were lifted from every successful sci-fi movie of the 90s. I didn't care about any of the characters whatsoever, even though the actors are talented.

I was able to overlook the shitty dialogue for the first half, because the concept of the Shimmer intrigued me enough. So the setup and beginning of the expedition were well executed. But as soon as they started explaining how it was a prism for all DNA, I felt disappointed. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief in the supernatural if it serves the plot well, or if it's fun and interesting enough... but this explanation fell short. I just didn't feel like the world we were seeing lined up with the prism analogy at all. Why do they forget the first few days of their trip? Why did people turn into plants, but the gator and bear turned into these insane mutated monsters? What was up with the crystal tree structures on the beach? That doesn't have anything to do with DNA. How did Ventress know it was extraterrestrial and why exactly did she explode into this psychedelic cloud?

Garland seems to be coasting on the success of his last film and people are giving him the benefit of the doubt, perhaps seeing more into Annihilation than is really there. I also read the book and while it explains a lot about the lack of closure in the film, it is much more interesting in how it unveils Area X's secrets.

Yes, the Shimmer world was incredible.

Yes, the soundtrack was moving.

Yes, the final twist(s) were some of the most well done I've seen.

But barring all of that, all of the adventurers besides Natalie Portman were pointless and plot holed characters. The Shimmer is possibly the most top secret thing ever to happen in human history, and it's openly acknowledged that it's being hidden by the US government. It makes sense that Natalie Portman, with prior military experience, may be let in under the circumstances.

But who else do they send in? A deluded psychologist with terminal cancer, a physicist with a history of mental illness, and . . . . a paramedic from Chicago. What?

And I could have gotten over that if the characters had any depth or uniqueness, but they didn't. Each one of them could have been described in a single sentence. The dialogue was stiff and awkward.

The cheating subplot served absolutely no purpose either. More unnecessary characters and character interactions.

I'll go ahead and double up on it: This movie would have been better if Natalie Portman went in by herself. More believable. More interesting. More recommended.

It was this rare instance of a science fiction movie absolutely crushing the ""science fiction"" part and then missing the ""regular, good old people"" part.

The science was really off, a sort of dumb science fetishisation yet all the language and visuals were silly. They should have had a molecular biologist give some input to make it feel less naff. The characters were two-dimensional and wasted the talents of the actors playing them. So they all had self-destructive impulses, therefore suicide. It didn't feel like it explored self-destruction with any intelligence or depth. Everything was very surface level and all of the issues and sci-fi ideas felt like they had been done better before. The ending was OK, that seems to have been a point of contention for some, it seemed to represent cross-fertilisation and potentially the creation of children with the Earth Lena ending up with the alien Kane and visa versa.](#spoiler)",7zqsdy

Also, a lot of the dialogue is really bad. Nobody speaks like these characters speak. [I absolutely loved the weirdness of the plants and animals, the predators especially.

I didn't see any point to this. The symbolism is being provided by the viewer's own interpretation. But, that's not how metaphors are supposed to work.

The being was either a sort of religious figure, like a god, or God, or maybe extra dimensional.

There was a shot at her eyes, the reflection when she's looking out the window that I thought was a subtle hint. Maybe Kane had come to visit her prior and already replaced/replicated her? So, when she went back maybe she was already an alien at that time coming to infect the rest of the group. Also, I need to go back and watch it and see if the scenes were she is showing emotion and crying are possibly just ""flashbacks"" of maybe her going through the shimmer alone at some point. Maybe She was sent into the shimmer alone at some point when he first came back. Some scenes she has long sleeves and some scenes she has a tank top.

A bit more scary, a bit more of a mindfuck, stronger and more developed characters , a bigger crazier ending at the lighthouse, or a bit more deep and introspective. Not bad, enjoyable, but not amazingly entertaining either. For fans of sci fi, wouldn't convince non sci fans to try and go see it.

dusrnns,"Few things: 1) Glad to see a movie finally where an M4 (Or was it somehow an M16? Never known a fully automatic one, maybe the shimmer refracted everyone's movie idea of what mode of fire M16Anythings can fire in) finally jams up almost immediately firing, those rifles, especially the military grade ones, are so faulty so often

2) Also glad to see them address why none of them have a machine gun (What looked like an M240B?) , since it's so insanely heavy

3) The entire movie reminded me of an acid trip, with the hints of rainbow colors everywhere; their initial walk through the shimmer after waking up was the stuff acid dreams in the forest are made of

4) I couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if the shimmer had continued to expand all throughout Florida; I've known quite a few individuals from there more colorful than the impossible foliage and oil-slick-like everything, and if their personalities and selves got refracted and expanded on, things like anything in r/FloridaMan would become terrifyingly unstoppable and insane

5) This was probably one of the best movies to channel the unique dread from Lovecraft and cosmic horror in general; one of the scariest memories I have is reading ""The Colour From Outer Space"" (Which this is the best live-action adaption of yet; even though it's based off the first book of The Outer Reach trilogy, the director stated he didn't re-read it, and adapted it like a ""dream of a book"", so it isn't entirely outside the realms of possibility something else, perhaps refracted through the mind's eye, snuck through into the adaption of the book, especially, again, since they stated there's no plans to adapt the rest of the books) in the Arizona desert, lit by a single flashlight at night, and then having to walk far away to the outhouse; it's one thing to read about the vast horror of man's insignifficance in the cosmos, it's another to hear about it and immediately see it, on a such a grand scale...like the subscribers to /r/thalassophobia or /r/submechanophobia could tell you, it's spooky to think of us, alone, on earth, drifting through the inky black depthless infinity of spacetime, at the will of, nor barely even cognizant, in any fashion, to beings so immensely greater and powerful than us as to instill pure terror at even glimpsing a glance of...the end of the movie, both a conclusion and non-conclusion (What is the shimmer? What is it's purpose? Does it have one? Is that important?) 

6) Alex Garland's AMA a few weeks back, where someone asked him something along the lines of, ""What will this bring to theaters?"" and his response was ""Psychedelia."" certainly makes more sense now; during Oscar Isaac's Kane prime scene, before he burns himself alive , I swear the wall behind him is shifting, some parts coming apart and changing, almost in anticipation of his finale, and breathing in a way, all was, again, very reminiscent of an acid trip, and the days after when you look at something solid and wonder if it really is moving or not, or if you're just tired, or if it always was and you're just now noticing it because your mind is freed...that, and stuff like the tattoo changing arms, really makes me feel like the movie would benefit from multiple views

7) One of my favorite bits of foreshadowing is when Kane first comes home (And on that, the movie also has a great way of making you feel the strange unplaceable horror that comes from feeling like a loved one, or someone you know so well, is now just slightly off as to appear alien in the truest sense of the word; the scene where he comes up the stairs silently, dutifully, like a dream, is so unsettling, as is every scene after when she tries to talk to him...weirdly enough, it reminded me of, if you've ever kissed someone in near darkness, or made out with them, where there's just enough light to make them visible, but not altogether recognizable, like your face in the mirror for extended periods under low light) and they're talking at the table, with the water in between their clasped hands, refracting everything

dx4j123,"Just watched this on Netflix tonight. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Extremely cinematic, the world really drew me in. There were some moments where some of the character's behaviour didn't really make sense (letting guard down, not taking precautions, etc.) but it was very easy to look past those moments because the entirety was so entrancing.

I also like that the movie didn't get bogged down. The mission to get to the lighthouse gave it a good momentum, while still giving time for the craziness of the shimmer to be explored. There were some really beautiful ideas here.

One thought that I haven't really seen mentioned here, is that the story reminded me of a Wizard of Earthsea. Spoilers in case you haven't read this amazing series. [Like Ged in Earthsea, Lena is almost battling her shadow at the end. And like Ged she discovers that there is no running away from it, or hiding from it, or even attacking and beating it. The way she ""wins"" is by recognising herself in it, and embracing that. Tbh, I still wonder about what that means in Earthsea so I don't think it makes things too much clearer, but it's something to add to the discussion.](#spoiler)

I really wanted to like this movie cuz i thought the cast did a great job but i just couldnt.

We had a great buildup to the start of the mysterious thing they call the Shimmer. Some great action and thrills during their journey inside.
Only to come down to a complete anti climatic mess where it seems that the director didnt know how to end it.

""I dont know"" as said by Lena sums up the ending pretty much.

dvp7azq,"Did anyone find the movie to be sloppily written? Like I couldn't understand the characters' motivation at all? For instance: - 

1.  [Why did the team of scientists didn't get an armed escort? It made no sense that the group went in there all alone. Despite them being military scientist, it seemed only Leena had combat experience. Rest of the team didn't even know how to shoot for fucks sake.] (#spoiler)  

2. [When they reached the first base camp, why the fuck was Dr. Ventress all studying the map or whatever she was doing with the lights on ALL ALONE? I mean it seemed obvious that a) She shouldn't be alone in hostile and unknown territory and b) it would attract a LOT of attention](#spoiler) 
3. [Again, after the mutated bear attack, when the group finds a cut off limb in the jungle, why the fuck did Lena volunteer to go all alone to find Sheppard's body? And why did anybody not volunteer to go with her. Even if she said no. Didn't make sense to me](#spoiler)

Overall, yes, I'd probably give the movie a 7.5/10 simply because of its unique premises and beautiful cinematography. BUT, the writing was BAD. Maybe I'm nitpicking about all this, but it was a turnoff for me and it certainly did spoil the movie experience for me to some extent. ",7zqsdy

dvlgtou,"Ok, finally saw this... what can I say, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. It had a couple of decent moments but this is a deeply flawed movie. I have not read the book so I don't know if it is just following the book here, but I am just commenting on how I felt of the movie as a standalone story here.

I will tell you my biggest problem with this movie, character motivations and reactions are just not realistic. I can't relate to them. I'm not sure what the director was trying to get at here or the screenplay, but there just wasn't a sense of realness to any of their reactions to things. I mean, there is this mysterious ""shimmer"" force and they spend the first third of the movie discussing how no one ever comes out of it, how them entering this could be a life and death decision, yet once inside they are just so nonchalant about things at first. You would think they would be personally freaking out at the sound of a twig snapping around them as they try to piece together what is going on. Some of their choices about hiking vs just taking a boat seem silly, but I guess that's probably just following the book. Overall, there never is this feeling of urgency for anything in any of them. I just feel like given the gravity of the situation, there might be more of that weight felt in their conversation, but instead it's like, ""Oh did you sleep ok? Oh that's nice."" Or ""Hey, we can't see anything! Well here, let me just turn off this lantern then for ya."" I mean, wut? (these aren't exact quotes, just examples of the tone).

Also, and I won't spoil the story, but the exposition explaining the plotline of what is going on in the middle of the movie (the one by the lady that is in Thor:Ragnarok, can't remember her name), felt so incredibly forced. ""Oh it makes perfect sense."" Really? This makes perfect sense? I don't know, but maybe the source material in the book it is played off better, but the entire team just acting like, ""Oh ok neat,"" and then continuing on again made zero sense. I mean, aren't these women supposed to be these brilliant scientists (aside from the medic)? Where is the curiosity? Where is them have theoretical discussions about how maybe the other things they saw were related. Where was the discussion about how what she just claimed in her exposition, how that could even be possible? Instead, they just think it's neat and carry on. I hate that.

Finally, the other major flaw of the film is the character development. The main character is fine, though maybe not completely interesting and compelling, but the rest of the team... I don't know, there just seemed to be little attempt to make them likable and/or interesting characters. When someone died, I literally felt no connection to the character.

I think story-wise, it's interesting, it's compelling, and I am sure it worked great as a book. The film was ok, not bad for a 1 time watch, but as a sci-fi movie lover, this is not going to go down as one I will likely ever revisit as I found it to mostly be forgettable. Ya, there were a couple of neat scenes, a couple of creepy things in it too, as others have mentioned here, as like I said, the movie isn't a total loss, I just wasn't crazy about it.",7zqsdy

I know it can be explained away that they were messed up in the head but they were prepared ahead of time and knew to expect weird and dangerous things but as soon as they go in they seem unprepared and begin unraveling.

Theres a lot of issues with plots and side plots, like the affair that seemed forced and contributed nothing, they could have just started the trip on the beach and gotten to the lighthouse far easier. Ending sucks, open-ended conclusions rarely work well anyway but in this film it especially flopped, mainly due to the fact we were told what happened yet it ends like theres some big mind blowing mystery that'll make everything bad about the film not matter. The plot summary before you even watch the film is done poorly. good CGI though. The bear and Benedict Wong are basically all thats good about this film",7zqsdy
dwapbca,"God awful, dumb, makes no sense, contrived, no payoff, ambiguous ending, pointless plot points that lead nowhere, just a waste of time pretty much. Vague dialogue that doesn’t go anywhere or lead to anything, pretentious plot resolution and no real purpose to the pointless ending.

Cool zombie bear scene, that’s just about the only good part. Watchable while you are watching but that’s oonly because you are expecting each scene to payoff into the next. So by the end you are left to say each scene sucked because in hindsight it was pointless. Fine acting, effects, sets etc, not a poorly made movie, it just went nowhere. ",7zqsdy
duu4i8v,"This movie didn't work for me because I didn't believe any of the characters for even a second. Not sure if it was the dialogue, casting choices, or the actress performances, but I just couldn't buy into any of them. 

A big reason for this I think is how the movie fucks up the ""show don't tell thing"". It tells you everything, you aren't shown a thing. There's literally a scene where a character rattles of everything the audience needs to know about every other character.  Instead of showing us self destructive characters we're merely told they are. It makes it hard to get into whats happening when I don't really care what happens to any of them. It also doesn't help that their fates are all told to you at the start of the movie",7zqsdy
duv12sk,"Writing a comment now will get lost but I'll give the unpopular opinion still because I'm just kind of tired of giving this movie all this praise.

I feel like this movie was just not as good as people are putting it to be. The characters I felt fell so far flat and off that caring about any of them just seemed pointless. Yes, there is emotion once a few events happen but do we ultimately care? No, because it was foreshadowed before hand so why even invest?

The caring for her reason to be there was almost established but the odd sex scenes spliced in I believe had no value after the 1st time. Didn't need it 2 more times.

The Shimmer was definitely interesting and building that world I was very interested in but only seeing a few scenes in which the environment was affected was disappointing. They build it up so much before you get in and it would of been interesting to see more of an impact and more of difference. Some things were subtle but so subtle I felt that it didn't grab attention.

The actress's in the film are all great, but the characters in which they portray? I found them all throw away's. The voice and mannerisms of the psychologist? Completely boring and the mono tone of her voice made me just want to erase her from the screen. Natalie Portman seems to drift in and out so much of being semi interesting to being a stereotype that it left you feeling like ""why keep following?"" that bit of  when she says ""I was in the military for 7 years"" was absolutely laughable I feel because you do not feel that at all what so ever. 

The concept I will admit is great, and there are amazing parts of this movie for sure, but is this a movie that is out standing and beautifully done? No. Its bits and pieces that teeter on a okay movie purely for the subject material and what the movie could be. ",7zqsdy
dvlo3tu,"You know what was more confusing than the phenomena happening in the movie? How such idiots were given responsibility to take charge about the situation. Nothing the crew that went into the shimmer made sense. No pictures or videos were being taken. Almost 0 documentation about the mutated flora and fauna. They were acting like tourists in the jurassic park and less like scientists. No personal memos to remind them that they were forgetting days and i could go on and on about the plotholes the story had. Also, we get it that Portman and her husband were very much in love and blah blah...no need to keep shoving it down our throats. ",7zqsdy

For me there was not a sense of existential dread attached to the movie. Nor was there a massive amount of ambiguity at the end. It seemed pretty straight forward in that Lena successfully destroyed the shimmer but a piece remained with her. The way I saw it, and another user pointed out, Kane was full on alien with human spliced and Lena is human with Alien spliced. There was so much ""refraction"" and ""crossing"" of genes that the tattoo on her arm was that of Anya. I had kind of guessed she would leave the Shimmer but not the same as when she went in. Nothing is ever that easy.

My husband was blown away at the visualization of life being formed and the rapid cellular generation to form the mimic. He definitely viewed the movie for what it was and I am jealous of him for that.

[In Prey, the ending has a character that looks similar to, and is voice acted by, the same guy who plays the guy who is debriefing the protagonist in the movie. In Prey, he is speaking to you, the player, who is sitting in a chair (parallel to the movie protagonist also being spoken to in a chair). Your character is an alien shapechanger who looks like a human. Throughout the game, you think you are human.

It's possible that the movie is influenced by the game considering how different the movie is from the book. The story is very, very similar. The alien ""infection"" also looks like the shimmer and also allows you to pass through unharmed. Youll see it in the link above when he turns you around to see the monitors. The earth is covered by the infection. The station you're on is studying it. Again, a parallel to them studying the shimmer from their station. The difference is, the Earth has already been taken over by the infection in the game, and they've moved their research station off-planet and are trying to figure out a way to stop the spread.](#spoiler)",7zqsdy

",7zqsdy
dut5ldn,"I seem to be in the minority thinking that it was just *good* but not *great*. Here are my points:


What I didn’t like:

* It was a little too terrifying for me to enjoy it. A lot of the body mutilations were really gross, and the bear screams were incredibly disturbing. I felt this aspect of the film was unnecessary 

* The plot had some holes in it. If nobody ever comes back, then why the hell do they keep sending people in?? And this team of 5 scientists, they send in *alone?* Only one of them has weapons training. Why not even give them a military escort? And why is their mission to go right to center of the Shimmer, rather than probing around the edges to gather data and then returning soon to minimize the risk of death?


What I liked:

* It was eerie, surreal, thought provoking, and mysterious. This movie really pulled you in; as it built up, I also felt this driving need to find out what the Shimmer was 

* I loved seeing them all go insane, one by one. It was really cool

* The climactic alien scene was fantastic. It was creepy, but not in a “jump scare/horror movie” way, which I really liked. 

* Although the ending was a little unoriginal (she single handedly stops the shimmer and saves the world), I loved the very last scene where she confronts her alien clone husband. The story isn’t over...the aliens are still here, among us, undiscovered. Is humanity still doomed? Is she even still human, or is she an alien too?

Overall I’d give it a 3/5. The biggest thing that I thought the movie did wrong was the blood and gore. I think it would have worked better as a hard PG-13 film. However it ended up being an unexpectedly creepy, hauntingly beautiful, and surreal sci-fi experience",7zqsdy
dv0p910,It's like the director didn't read all 3 books. I feel like if the movie was going to be SO absurdly different from the book then maybe he should have just made an original 'alien movie'. Because this film didn't reflect the themes of the book at all. ,7zqsdy

dvtpyfi,"Just saw it on Netflix, beatiful film.

However, one thing bugged me incredibly. The Shimmer's origin was in the lighthouse by the sea, so why the hell did they carry out their expeditions FROM LAND, seemingly very far away from the centre??

To me the obvious way would have been to take a boat from the seaside edge of the Shimmer. ",7zqsdy
dzk2cfw,"Half baked movie. Typical Alex Garland. He sets things up, seeming to ask philosophical questionss, but ends up with either no answer or just half baked ones.  Ex Machina was similar but more fleshed out, but the end was the same half baked stuff. I get that it's meant to be vague but it's nonsense. The shimmer changes dna... and makes exact copies of you including clothes, blood stains, and tattoos which aren't genetic. Vantress was waiting for Lena before vaporizing? Lena didnt rmb setting up tents but remembered everything else so well. Also why was she more tolerant of the shimmers effects? If you make it to the lighthouse they will copy you (oscar isaac and lena) but not van tress? And how does any of it make it ""annihilation""? It's more like ""mutation"".

Also the simple stuff like going in w no protection, sending in women only, few supplies, no other techs, no real plan,...

A couple of things that i havent seen mentioned.(or just overlooked)
-Figure 8 on her arm not only a selfdestructing snake, but also a dividing cell
-leaving the safety of guard tower stupid..  yeah... but the movie is about selfdestruction so...
-i havent read the book(s?) so cant say for sure, but i think lena is full of shit. Either she is the clone or she knows very well she is mutated. If the scientists knew that kane was a clone they would kill it with fire. Instead of saying her husband or kane is doing better after the bubble bursted.

My question that I haven't seen brought up is, did Kane and Shepard also have an affair? Kane's self destructive motive was never given.

When Leena just meets the team and Josie mentions that a member of the last team made it back, the camera stays focused on Shepard a bit longer. When talking to Leena, Shepard said her daughter and lover have recently died. And Thorenson has gone mad, but there has to be a reason why she thinks Leena would want Shepard dead.

Even then, I could hardly remember much about what I had seen from them and, no, I’d not read the book. That said, I found this movie to be kind of bad. The main issue I had is the characters, as none of them seemed fleshed-out or even very interesting. Lena really didn’t have much character of her own; most of her stuff was just about her relationship with Kane. The others were pretty one-note and had their traits and flaws told to us through Sheppard rather than shown. Besides this, I noticed a lot of dumb tropes in the movie like “oh, everyone else hasn’t come back from the shimmer okay, but we’re gonna be the ones that do. Oh, what’s that, Sheppard died? This is too much, nobody said it would be hard, let’s get out of here.” Not to mention when that one edgy girl managed to tie up all three of the other characters and do that thing where she goes crazy and turns on everyone seemed really dumb and just kind of forced for the plot-sake. That’s not to say the movie didn’t have good things though as the bear-creature as well as the climax in general were very creative, visually interesting, and creepy as they should’ve been. Also, I really liked the little score jingle for the shimmer monsters. Besides those elements and a few other ideas however, I didn’t like it. I can tell there was some kind of deeper theme thing going on, and I’m sure it’s pretty interesting if you really analyze it, but on the surface-level, I didn’t find this to be a very good film.",7zqsdy

They wanted to make it high concept but also accessible to the average moviegoer who wants to watch explosions and jumping from helicopters onto buildings and similar stuff where you dont have to think. It holds your hand too much for a high concept film. Everything gets tied up at the end with a nice bow, nothing is left to question. They point blank explain the main couples motives even though they were already shown in the flashbacks. It also tries to set up its own rules then just doesnt play by them, its implied that only organics are affected since all the physical structures are unaffected, cool. Wait no, its actually light and radio waves get refracted too, alright i guess atmospheric conditions can do this, okay cool. Then we get to the salt/silica trees on the beach, well shit. Its got some neat concepts and some great aspects, but i feel like it was wayyyyyyy too tame for the concept. Things should have been really crazy near the lighthouse which had the longest and most concentrated exposure, i guess they mustve burned through the cgi budget on the hellbear b/c the lighthouse should have been a fractal mess.

Earlier that day we get a clear view of Lena's left underarm when she is leaning on the doorframe of the guardtower. Later, right after she is leaving the lighthouse, we can see her left underarm again, and there is the ""8"" tattoo. The tattoo is still there when she is being debriefed/interviewed. The tattoo actually belongs to Anya(the crazy chick that put them in the chairs).

Lena is not herself anymore, and is probably a clone. ",7zqsdy

So that scene on first entering the shimmer - In the book, the Psychiatrist (Ventress) has keywords which are able to 'control' the other team members (hypnotize I guess) - I took this scene in the film to suggest she had done exactly that - but it was never mentioned again...felt very off.

dvobgkd,"Unpopular opinion but I didn't like it. It had great build up and intrigue throughout which falls through in the final act. The ending made me feel cheated. It didn't really ~~explain~~ *provided a payoff to* what was going through and turned it into ""let's burn it"" solution to problem.",7zqsdy
duslh4f,"This movie was pretty unfocused in terms of mood and style. As well as disappointing. There were a lot of problems, and I feel if they really focused they could've ended up having a film similar to It Comes at Night. Where it provides an intense experience while providing some thoughtful ideas, but having an ending that can really not work for some but work for others. But overall, man, they missed the mark. 

The horror elements were really great and I appreciate how they went all out. But, it wasn't a horror film. I mean most horror films (including Prometheus which is very similar in terms of adventure and wonder in a terrifying alien place) have a sense of dread throughout the film where you're unsure and scared what's going to happen next. I spoke with my friends and they felt the exact way. There was no lingering suspense between the horror scenes. The horror scenes kind of just came out of nowhere. I mean shit, until the stomach scene (which was fucking fantastic, by the way) I didn't even know it was rated R. And even then, I didn't know it was meant to be a part horror film. I only figured it out when the speaking bear came in. Which again, that was fucking ingenious and another fantastic scene. But right after that and between scenes, I felt nothing. I felt no suspense or tension. I wasn't scared they'd run into some other horrifying creature. The scenes when they show up are awesome, but the wandering in between just felt meandering and mostly pointless other than the characters getting from A to B with some boring dialogue in between. 

Speaking of the dialogue, it was pretty fucking generic. It kind of pissed me off. It tried to do this whole subverting cliches shit, and while each character avoids a cliche, they still end up pretty bare bones and boring save for the couple main characters. Plus they don't do anything but harm the film. If you're going for a suspense/horror/sci-fi, then you gotta commit. Don't make these jokes making fun of cliches. While I laughed at the ""Oh is THAT what you think at do, waiting for you to come home? Just stare up at the stares!?"" It makes me feel too safe. And that's the main issue here, I felt too safe until the action came. And while that can work, make us suddenly scared, it kind of sets us up to make us almost think we're not gonna expect something else. That, and I don't really care about the characters. They barely have any personality because they wanted to be so anti-cliche. That's great and all, but you can't just now leave them as the ""girl who cuts herself cause she wants to feel alive"" and the ""big strong girl that's super nice,"" otherwise they're just disposable and boring. I mean it's fine and doable, but when it comes from Alex Garland who wrote and directed Ex Machina, I expect a lot better. None of the characters except the alien are very memorable, despite pretty solid performances. Even Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac's characters were forgettable, other than the fact they really loved each other and read books together. 

Oh and the alien, on the other hand, was pretty well realized and was fantastic. Minus the generic dark alien ship/pod, the alien itself was fucking awesome. The mirroring scene was intense, genius, and subtle. It catching on fire was pretty dope, and I got a feeling that was meant to be a jab at humans. You know, the alien doing exactly what humans are doing and ending up destroying the world around it. At least, I imagine that was the analogy. 

TL;DR On the whole, it's fine. It's doable. It's got some great, GREAT stuff in here. But it's also surrounded by a lot of mediocrity, especially in the characters and dialogue. The major problem, though, is that the mood is just not sticking anywhere. Disappointing, but I'm not mad that I spent 9 bucks to see it. ",7zqsdy
dv54xj5,"I’m sorry, but are there no other fans of the books out there who are super pissed about how much Alex Garland changed the entire plot and characterization? I understand changes are necessary for adapting a book to a film, but Garland changed nearly everything, and these changes cheapened or undermined the point of everything VanderMeer constructed. 

Instead of an interesting protagonist in the biologist, a woman cut off from her emotions and much more interested in nature than in people, we get Lena, a woman who cries a lot and runs off to Area X because she “owes it to” her husband. Forget the fact that their relationship was already broken in the book (and in a much more interesting way than some shoe-horned flimsy plot about adultery) and that she willingly gave her husband back to the military once she realized he was not himself. Guess an ambulance chase was more exciting. 

Don’t get me started on all the ways the film ruined the fascinating characters of the book, who, despite having no actual names (only job titles), felt fully realized and unique without falling into cliche. They feel one-dimensional in the film and their actions are unmotivated, just strung along for plot purposes. 

All of the monsters in Area X were changed, and only one was halfway interesting. I enjoyed the bear because it was terrifying, but so was the moaning creature in the book, and the fact that we only “hear” it, but don’t “see” it in the book makes it much creepier. This is one of the main problems with the film—it commits a cardinal sin of horror: constantly showing you the monster. Alligator? See it immediately. Bear? See it. Alien blob/crawler substitute? See it up close, in detail. I loved the indescribable physics-defying aspects of the book’s horrors because they forced you to imagine how scary they might be. All good horror, in film and literature, refuses to show you the monster in full, because the darkness of your imagination is always scarier than seeing in full light. 

I honestly believe you could adapt the book almost seamlessly, without changing almost anything, and you’d have a movie 100x better than the shit I just saw. Maybe most people just haven’t read the book, so they weren’t expecting a faithful adaptation? I just honestly think the book is so much more interesting. The film version felt forgettable and boring in comparison.

1) When we see the video tape of the soldier with the moving intestines, what is causing his intestines to move? I know that everyone's DNA is being altered and mutated but later, when the girls discover the same soldier's body, I got the feeling that his body was like a cocoon and what we see is the aftermath of whatever was molting in him escaping from his body. So this isn't DNA altering so much as it's a type of creature using bodies for cocoons, right? 

2) When we see Kane in the second video tape, we see him descend into the hole in the lighthouse and there is a brief shot of him just before he gazes into the bright ball of gas thing, as if someone else is video taping him. Who else would be video taping him? Did someone else make it to the lighthouse with him?

3) During the same sequence, we see the video tape pan up the outside of the hole and one of the creepy alien clone things is looking down the hole at Kane and the potential other dude. Seeing how Lena's alien clone spawned in front of her eyes in the hole, how is the clone we see in the tape looking down the hole? ",7zqsdy

The movie kept cutting back to the relationship Portman had with Oscar Isaac’s character and her affair with the other professor. At first I thought it was just a sad little backstory to help the character arc of Portman but then something hit me.

I think the film is telling the story of the affair. Think about it: after an affair both people in the relationship go through some incredible change. It can be scary and it can be beautiful. All the women who went into the shimmer were damaged people who have experienced trauma of some sort. This was Natalie Pittman’s story of her beating the part of her that caused the downfall of her relationship, and her goal is to literally save her husband, and therefore, her marriage.

At the end, it’s shown that he isn’t the husband. This can be seen as a metaphor that he has completely changed as a person due to learning about the affair. What was interesting is how Natalie’s character returns. So does that mean she hasn’t changed? Will she cheat again?

The answers are seemingly obvious if we go ahead with the cancer metaphor. That is, Lena goes in and destroys the cancer making Kane sick.

However, the answers don't seem to be obvious/existent if we think of the literal story being told. For example,
1. When the alien dies, it kills all things it had created (the trees, the colorful bubble etc). However, by that reasoning, Kane should have died as well, along with the last remaining shimmer inside Lena. 

2. If Kane was sick because he is not an actual human and could not adjust to Earth's environment outside the shimmer, why would this change when the shimmer gets destroyed? Why would Lena not fall sick by the same reason? (She contains a bit of it inside her.)

I haven't seen these addressed anywhere, and I'm gonna go on a self destructive streak if I have to read one more piece analysing the movie. ",7zqsdy
dvmorp5,"I give this a solid 4.5/5 

There really isn't much bad about this film. If you like slow-burning tension mixed with just the right amount of seat jumps then you'll love it. Plenty of the nature scenes are pure beauty and the ending is a hypnotic piece of cinema that will stay in my head for some time.

My only real complaints came after I unsuspended my disbelief once the credits rolled and started asking why they didn't record every moment of their journey towards the lighthouse. It would have made so much more sense as a data-gathering expedition.

I understand exactly why they didn't do this, because it would have killed the pacing of the drama and made the whole in medias res premise established at the start of the film redundant.

In a very weird way, this movie some how reminded me of the stupendously bad movie with great ideas, Southland Tales (2008). I loved the high concept of the plot. I think Josie's acceptance of her fate was glorious. I think the literal 'kill it with fire' ending was perhaps a little disappointing (I would certainly have preferred the entire human race just accepting that they are going to merge with all living things) but admit that it was presented in a visually enjoyable way.

All in all, great movie, I hope it makes a killing on DVD sales or something. Which it probably won't, being a Netflix original.

dwaf9nm,"I'll leave my simple comment here, not to critic, but to say my opinion (probably wrong).
I voted it on the poll, it seems I was a little below the average, but I'll explain why.
To me, the mystery of this alien form in not so mysterious after all...
It's an observer, it visited earth not on purpose (or maybe yes), it's just a seed of an entity probably already spread in the universe.
It's just a random lifeform, not sentient, not with a purpose, the sense of purpose probably is not even sensed with it.
It's a virus-like thing, but also seems not biological, an entity that transforms.
(Note that Ventress says ""religious? Physical? Alien?"" Almost if the autor says that is not important).
Nothing too fascinating for me, it's SOMETHING that CHANGE beings, in other things. It does that just bacause, and probably it doesn't stops to think why is doing it because it has no brain.
It's a metaphor of change, and Lena, just refused the change, giving it the phosphorus grenade.
The alien-thing decided-realized-couldn't help to just interrupt the change because REASONS.
Weren't we ready? Did we explicitly refused the offering? Was it a choise at all? Did the change actually stopped?
Who cares. The movie just doesn't seems to care. It's all a metaphor made to project yourself and whatever you believe.

I think it was just an emotional mirror.
Nothing fancy, seen it already, but not bad.

I was expecting something that was involving reasoning (like Arrival 2016), but this was actually pure emotions.
And those were not at them peak when I was watching, so it just reflected my momentary apathy...

I liked that, and I wanted to see the tower, the crawler, and the pile of journals. I also found the hypnotic suggestion in the book interesting. 

The film was visually great. The bear scene, if it wasn't my taste, was great. I didn't enjoy the loudness of the sound and plugged my ears several times toward the end.

dvnp8vx,"So... just watched the movie. My lingering thoughts before reading any comments:

A blend of alien/arrival/war of the world’s/2001/ex machina

The movie seems most like “war of the world’s” in that the alien’s ultimate demise is its lack of inoculation from something that plagues humanity, yet has learned to co-exist with it, as well. In WotW, it’s microbes. In annihilation, it’s our self-destructive tendencies and cancer at the molecular level.

I guess, in the end, the shimmer gets the last laugh because it’s now got an “Adam & Eve” to start changing the humans around it, like in Ex Machina. 

If so, that’s where the ending fell flat for me. I believe I was supposed to feel a surprise twist of sudden dread at the last shot. Alas, I did not. For a movie that was spectacularly bewildering, it’s ending was rather staid and predictable—a similar feeling I had with “ex machina.”

Visual effects and atmosphere were fantastic. The character arcs were perfunctory. The setup felt a little rushed. And, I think they should have used some other vehicle besides infedelity to demonstrate lena’s Self-destructive tendencies.

Still, as far as breaking new barriers, this movie far exceeds “ex machina.” I have a feeling this will be remembered far better than it was in its time, a la 2001...

Verdict: 3 out of 4 stars, overall.",7zqsdy

I have mixed feelings on how Vandemeer handled the progression of the story in the 2nd and 3rd Southern Reach books so I thought that the succinct, shortened story that the movie settled on was actually better in some ways.

What if notKane was just someone who volunteered because they wanted to be like Kane and eventually mutated into him. Him slowly mutating over the cause of the mission would explain why Kane treated him like a friend before Kane died.

Furthermore the way in which notKane deteriorated at the start of the movie seems too human in a way (the clone, while burning, returned to its shimmery self and went almost peacefully), and how he recovered after the shimmer was destroyed makes me think it had a hold on him but wasn’t him.

The biggest thing I have against the film is I think it relied far too much on CGI, especially some moments that could have been so much more convincing. [I think the room under the lighthouse felt like they were just sitting in a green screen set, and the alien mimic scene looked like Natalie Portman doing interpretive dance with the alien from Signs. I wish they had used a costume of some kind or a set-piece for the room beneath.](#spoiler)

Overall, I still feel like Ex Machina was a much better film. It hit the beats with the right amount of unpredictability, but it was also felt like it came together with a little more elegance. [Oscar Issac's death and the ending of Ex Machina were just stone cold awesome and horrifying. I think the ending of Annihilation was well done, but the characters didn't really have much development.](#spoiler)",7zqsdy
duwpcxh,"So there's a lot I want to ask since I can't really come up with definitive answers on my own.

[What did they eat anyway? I mean Lena says she doesn't remember eating. Is it possible that, if this is the real Lena, that she mutated in some way to the point where she didn't need nutrition? Could she be blatantly lying because she's actually an alien? Could she not understand the concept of eating because she's actually an alien?](#spoiler)

I know I'll get a lot of hate because people will say that it was [obviously not the real Lena because at the end we see her eyes start to shimmer.](#spoiler) I kind of disagree. [I think that Kane's clone teleports from Area X or somewhere close outside of Area X to Lena's house and is obviously weakened. But why is he weakened?](#spoiler)

I think that he's either [too far from the shimmer/lighthouse, the teleportation took a toll on him, he maybe needs human life to continue living, or because he's outside of the shimmer and the shimmer is the only source of energy for the aliens. Now Lena and ""Kane"" hug at the beginning of the film, so I also think that it's possible that Lena was infected all along, or from the very beginning. I also think that it's possible that ""Kane"" could not infect Lena because it was too weak to do so, so at the end, when ""Kane's"" vitals are stabilized, he's healthy enough to infect Lena and turn her into another alien. His eyes look so dilated and creepy at the end and it shows Lena's eyes sort of change color and move AFTER they embrace for a moment and Oscar Isaac's closeup is transitioned into Natalie Portman's. They could have been communicating also! That's why he looks so angry/creepy.](#spoiler)

If Kane's [clone can teleport, and if his clone does want to infect others, why doesn't he simply teleport outside of isolation?](#spoiler)

Why the hell was the [house they made camp in identical to Lena's house, or at the very least the staircase](#spoiler) (because that's obviously the main point)?

How do the ""police""/government figure out that [Kane or Kane's clone has arrived back at Lena's house? Did they put a possible nationwide search out for any individuals under Kane's name that were admitted to the hospital or had an ambulance called for them?](#spoiler)

Was anybody else annoyed at Natalie Portman's poor performance during one of the [present-day interrogation scenes?](#spoiler) [I think that she could be infected and that's why she's a lot less emotional/human, but she seems to be acting pretty okay during other scenes of that nature, so I'm unsure as to why it kinda sucked at that one point.](#spoiler) In the future, if I know the timestamp, I'll let you know which part I'm talking about.

Was anybody else annoyed with Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance in some nitpicky areas? She was being so [vague, annoying, and ambiguous at the beginning of the film when she first questions Lena.](#spoiler) [Not even in a way that was understandable like because she's moody and edgy since she has cancer, that comes later on in the film, and that is in my opinion a good performance. Her performance as whatever the hell that thing was in the hole was also really good I enjoyed that.](#spoiler) Also why was [her face grey?](#spoiler) That was creepy as fuck. I get into that more below.

Does anybody think that the [hair change](#spoiler) with Oscar Isaac's character have any symbolic representation? [It's very slicked back and clean with his alien self as opposed to being kinda curly and out there beforehand.](#spoiler)

Also, during one of the flashback scenes when [Kane is leaving Lena to go on the expedition, he's acting extremely similar to how he acted when he first teleported to Lena's house at the beginning of the movie. He's being cold, distant, and he doesn't seem all there. Again, his hair is glossy and swept backwards. That emotional behavior could also be because of Kane's discovery of the affair.](#spoiler)

Was the [affair](#spoiler) stuff added to build her character or to explain the [self-destruction/suicide](#spoiler) thing further? I thought the first [""sex scene"" right after they enter the shimmer](#spoiler) was excellently timed and definitely built character and left serious implications about Lena's character. However, the second time was repetitive and the conversation afterwards felt really unnecessary. 

Was anybody annoyed when [Josie gets attacked by the alligator? It seems like something very forcefully grabs her by her bag and pulls her straight backwards. I think an alligator more than has the ability to possibly jump up, bite her bag, and drag her either downwards or in a certain direction, or maybe both, but not in a straight line like that.](#spoiler)

Also, why do the creatures seem [much stronger and versatile than normal? Humans seem to get weaker from it and become infected, but the bear and alligator, although seriously mutated and sort of weak-LOOKING, take a lot more bullets than I would have normally expected.](#spoiler)

How the hell does the [bear manage to attack and abduct Cass when she seems to sort of be in the middle of Lena/Ventress and Josie/Paramedic?](#spoiler)

What was up with the [skull pattern in front of the lighthouse? Why did they leave the guy they cut open on the video to become spores and plants and shit?](#spoiler)

So that [black room under the lighthouse, it manifests itself as someone you know or someone you love/care about and disintegrates/transforms into a device or creature that absorbs a part of your DNA, multiplies the cells and creates a body based on that. Then it corners you and mirrors you so it can be and act just like you. If that theory is correct, it means that Ventress either never made it to the lighthouse, or made it, was killed/died and her clone departed elsewhere.](#spoiler)

I had assumed at the end when the [shimmer was destroyed that Josie was most likely dead or perhaps turned to normal, but her whereabouts are unknown. If there was only one source of power on earth for the shimmer, the lighthouse, could it being destroyed have transferred all of its energy and power to Kane's clone, making him the new lighthouse? This ties back into my other theory that he is now strong enough to infect others since he's the new lighthouse, and makes Lena's irises move and change color after infecting her.](#spoiler)

Did anybody else cringe at the really forced dialogue between Josie and Lena during [their final moments together?](#spoiler) 

Did anybody else notice how Cass' character seemed to [know a lot more than she was letting on about the shimmer](#spoiler) during the boat scene?

Why the hell did Alex Garland write the movie so that [we already know the fates or the lack thereof of all of the crew members?](#spoiler) It takes away all the suspense! Oh, I know [Lena is going to survive all this because she's in the present being interrogated! I guess we're not entirely sure it's her throughout the film but still. The suspense, thrill, and hope for the other squadmates is also kind of ruined because she says they're either dead or missing. But again, we can't be positive she's telling the truth about that.](#spoiler)

I know that was far too long, but I had to get every question and theory I had in my head out there after this roller coaster of a movie. I had to give it an 8 because I had issues with some dialogue, performances, logic, and plot/character development choices, but I think that any film that can evoke this kind of emotion and reaction from me is definitely GREAT. So good job Alex Garland, this shit was good and I enjoyed myself immensely.

dvtx77r,"I saw Annihilation 3 nights ago and it has been thrashing around in my head ever since. Even just for that I rate it very highly.

I realise my take is not one that inspired the creators of the movie, but that is the power of art. I am an Australian and living in a high immigrant nation and I see some of the struggles that many new arrivals face. Disconnection from lives and cultures which were familiar and now irrevocably altered by their exposure to a Western country.

Permit me to shoot out a few thought bubbles.

Lighthouse – symbol of a beacon, perhaps the Statue of Liberty 

The Shimmer – Western/American culture and its creeping pervasiveness across the globe.

Entering the Shimmer – the immigrant experience, once exposed to the culture forever changed, never returning. Undreamt of access to arts, literature, architecture, Disney worlds, drugs, pornography, guns, and where the best of you can flourish but the worst of you is waiting to be tempted and to destroy you.  Where the deranged violence of Tarantino movies become touchstones of culture (love his work btw) or where a Whitley painting of terror, pain and addiction can be deemed high art.
https://media.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection_images/3/355.1998.a-c%23a%23S.jpg

The following quote speaks to theme/language of the movie, even the mimicry.

“They give us an opportunity to consider our culture as refracted through a foreign and clarifying prism.”

duq1eqd,"Saw this last night and loved it. I thought it was visually amazing, and the story was really interesting, especially the ending! I forgot it was based of a book series, so I'd be super interested to see them continue in film as well, but given the whole Netflix deal and studio uncertainty, I'm not sure I'd bank on it.

I did have two criticisms with the film, and not the ambiguity of the ending. First, I would've loved to see more monsters, but then again, I don't think they were the point of the movie. The characters were also really dumb with how they handled their firearms, for example ditching the guns to run after the girl that got attacked by the monster gator and also often pointing the guns at each other on accident. Just poor gun handling skills. ",7zqsdy
dvqke3t,"As much as I loved all of the philosophical elements of this movie and how it's notions of human deterioration and constant change lingered with me for weeks after seeing it, I can't help but shake the feeling that it was a subpar adaptation to an incredible premise. The depth of the story and development that went into the source material didn't seem to match the production values. It could have benefited greatly from some more impressive visuals and a more even score. I loved when the music finally hit at the film's climax but it made the rest of the film feel so empty and unfinished. 7/10",7zqsdy

I did not enjoy the sequence at the end with the hypnotic butthole rainbow alien. Once it copied Portman's character I felt like I was watching an exceptionally shitty modern dance routine on *so You Think You Can Dance*. 

To be fair, I was super high while watching this, so may have not been the best state of mind to capture whatever nuance they were trying to communicate. ",7zqsdy
dvneoll,"I definitely think this is worth watching -- if nothing else, for the visuals and the atmosphere alone -- but I think  it's fairly inconsistent at various points, especially once it reaches the third act.

By the time Natalie Portman's character reaches the lighthouse, the theme of self-destruction -- which remains prevalent throughout the film -- seems to be completely abandoned in favor of a sort of weird, vague discussion of personhood and identity. Now, that's certainly an interesting theme to explore (what makes us who we are? etc.), but it kind of came out of nowhere there, starting from when we first see that Oscar Isaac has a 'double' on the found footage all the way to the final shot -- and the whole self-destruction thing (which was building up from the characters, the cheating flashbacks, the cancer motifs) was kind of just... dropped. That felt weird.

It's funny, because I also really liked the third act in and of itself. It was refreshing to have it not be 20 minutes of action scene, fights, chases and explosions. The cerebral aspect of it was really nice, and the tone awesome... it just felt thematically out of place with the rest of the film (including the final scene, which really felt like it belong to a different film -- one that discussed identity from the beginning, not from the 1:30 hour mark onward). It kind of felt like the film started off wanting to discuss self-destruction and got too caught up with the (admittedly interesting) repercussions of cloning/DNA-miming and what that means for us in terms of identity, so it just switched gears halfway through. Felt weird for me.

Other minor things that bugged me were what seemed to me to be lazy choices in the script: mainly stiff dialogue and weird character decisions (especially Natalie Portman being allowed in the super secret facility, being told about the super secret project and, to top it all, being granted a spot on the mission merely by asking for it. Felt like a very lazy way to stuff the character into the story).

Overall I still think it's worth watching and was definitely an interesting film, but I don't feel like it's the masterpiece people are making it out to be. Ex Machina is vastly superior.",7zqsdy

For some reason I just didn't get much tension out from this, there was some freaky stuff in here but I just wasn't that impressed by any of it and I was pretty much like: ""Alright, what else you got?"". Like the [scene where they find a guy just splattered on the wall](#spoiler), it was gross, but didn't really do anything for me and I don't know why :/ It just needed that **something** to gear up even more the sense of danger and I think they should have kept the [bear](#spoiler) around a bit longer for that purpose. The scene with the [bear inside the house](#spoiler) was great and I wish this had more scenes like that.

Also I think the CG weren't that great at times, especially whenever they shoot some creatures it just looked plain bad in my opinion + the scene with the deer-creatures, the way they moved and all just looked off and animated to me.

dvrep7m,"-- WARNING : CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS --

I just finished watching it. I think is a great movie. Ever so lately, I feel I don't connect with new cinema anymore but this movie was different to me. It's a beautiful movie, thought provocative, the premises are well presented and you are given details that I think are left vague on purpose so you come up with your own interpretation.

I think Lena, the real Lena died very early upon entering the shimmer, along with the rest of the group (not sure if the singulraity/event maybe killed them upon entering). I think the movie touches a few interesting concepts present in other things not just movies (for example the game SOMA). The idea is , if a copy of yourself it's still you. Food for thought indeed.

I think the shimmer is hinted at being a multidimensional being of some sort, or a manifestation of some sort, that wanted to understand life as we understand it (carbon based living forms) by copying, tweaking it , figure out what life is, and gathered that humans were kind of different. I believe the final scene hints at ""it"" wanting to communicate with Lena. The shimmer isn't aware of what we call communication, for all it knows we communicate moving around and make noises (like the creature tried to produce in its own way with the synth noises) that the shimmer can't comprehend since we are as alien to the shimmer as the shimmer is to us. Think of a chemist tinkering with ant pheromones to try to communicate with an ant without even knowing what an ant is or anything related with the ant environment.

The reason I say this is because the creature (physical manifestation of the shimmer to ressemble something we would udnerstand as a life form) mimicked almost perfectly her movements, others the creature would do something (e.g. repel her attack, or prevent her from exiting the lighthouse). I'm pretty sure the shimmer was super clueless what communication is , since it was mimicking Lena when she was struggling groggy to stand up. It annoyed me a bit that Lena , a very intelligent scientist well travelled, couldn't infer this. What's the point of sending a bunch of scientists if Lena at what looks (to me) like a clear communication attempt answers with blowing the thing up with a grenade.

I think this last bit was probably done for budgetary reasons, as it leaves the movie open ended and sparks debate. I liked it very much and I think this movie is amongst my all time favourites now.",7zqsdy
dvxet7p,"I loved this movie the first time. Upon 2nd viewing, eh. You can’t rely on special effects and a beautiful soundtrack. Same goes for Ex Machina. This flick is definitely going to go far in the long run and it will be a good model for films of the sort. I’m excited to see what Garland comes up with next, and this is a great 2nd project.

Only thing was, it was like a new born baby. It didn’t know what it was doing, happening or where it was. It just knew it existed by copying things. So initially that’s what it did right when it was born. It didn’t know anything else BUT copying. All it needed was blood, since team leader cancer stick had no injuries it couldn’t copy her DNA just it’s physical structure. Explain the human trees. until main bitch gave her some. It then took form and tried to survive. It didn’t even know what A grenade was. Main chick figured it out, figured that it couldn’t mentally comprehend what’s going on and Handed it a grenade, and then exploded. It TRIED copying the fire, what is fire? Total destruction. It can’t copy total destruction so it purely just disintegrated and tried and tried. The cancer virus was airborne how couldn’t it be? That’s why the husband and wife were altered in the end. They weren’t the same. Specially the chick.

[However I still prefer the direction the books took and the film really was let down in the last 25 minutes - storywise at least, not visually. 
Everything turning to ash just wrapped it up all too quickly, The books took a totally different direction - which I guess would need another film to properly show - which won't happen ](#spoiler)

I'm not here to give a full review or anything. But the only thing I don't yet understand is the ending. The real Kane is dead, yes, and his biological double is now in the isolation room. But it appears the real Lena makes it back alive. She destroyed her double, and the shimmer. So why do her eyes change at the end as well? Either the shimmer is physically living on inside of her, or it's just a symbolic way of showing that she is a totally new person psychologically. But the physical eye change suggests the shimmer is still alive... inside of her. ",7zqsdy

duy076x,"The whole movie is a metaphor for a spiritual journey. I haven't read the book but I'm sure that the author ""Jeff Vandermeer"" went through this journey in his own life. The director did leave in small clues as to the actual meaning of the film. In the film the husband said very little. But one of the most important things that he did say was, something to the effect of ""don't you know God can hear you"". The husband was on a spiritual journey in his life.  His mission that he was supposedly on which he couldn't explain where or when, is because it was all a mental mission. Another clue that they left in, if you remember the book that she was reading while on the sofa with her husband? ""The Immortal Life Of Henrietta Lacks"". And why did they keep going back to the affair in crucial moments of the movie? Byproducts of the mental breakthroughs that she was making stemming from her moral dilemma at the crossroads in her life. And what was the point of contact of the meteor? The epicenter of there journey...the lighthouse. Which are navigation aids for the lost. A physicist, paramedic, surveyor and geologist. Coincidence. All of these can be taken as pillars of an individual which was Lena. Hence the same tattoo on all of them. As well as the house in the ""shimmer"" was identical to Lena's house. As well as the final building where the monster bear attacked was Lena's place of work, and where the affair began. The last person to make it to the lighthouse was the psychologist. Through the mind to shed the false reality most live in to seek enlightenment. And Lena did come face to face with her reality of existence. Which had no face or self. Very similar to a Neo matrix mortal death when he and she learned the truth of there existence. Which kills many through the journey (which did the others) symbolically, but takes you closer once on the other side. Gautama Buddha reached spiritual enlightenment after meditating after 48 days under a tree in the meditative position the husband Kane died in his physical death. The shimmer is a metaphor on embarking on that spiritual journey. At the end of the movie the only way the doctor could grasp what happened to her was to chalk it up as an alien encounter of some kind. In conclusion, there was no ""Shimmer"". Peace and LOVE, Jeff Vandermeer",7zqsdy

As a stand-alone project, I thought it was brilliant.

There's no ambiguity there for the rest of the movie.), but the setwork, score, and general acting were great.

That...was something else. In a good way. I wasn't really feeling it at first but it slowly grew on me.

Spoiler free recommendation for those considering it:

If there's one thing that comes to mind after viewing this it's that this made for an incredible theater experience. I know that sounds shitty for those who will have to view it on Netflix but this more than most movies really benefits from the theater environment. If you're even a little interested, please go see it now while it's in the biggest theater your venue has. I had to travel 45 mins to see it and am so glad I did. This would have been one of those films I regretted not seeing on the big screen. I went with a friend who casually enjoys sci-fi and they also had a great time.

For those who will have to watch on Netflix: do yourselves a favor and turn down the lights, turn up the volume, and place that phone of yours in another room. I really think this needs your full attention with diminished distractions.

Not only are they quite chatty (lots of quips and snide remarks at the most bizarre things), but they popped on closed captioning (we're under a flight path). 

It never occurred to me how much closed captioning ruins thrillers or whatever when a character's lines are cut off, just that as someone who enjoys foreign films, it's more distracting if you're not hearing impaired and it's in your native language.

For example:

[The bit when the bear shows up? <in Cassie's voice> Help me! 
Dang. The people who did the captioning should have at least timed the subs for that bit to play once the creature opened its mouth, kinda shitty for people who genuinely need them.](#spoiler)

They really liked the film so it beats me why they ruin the experience by making a ton of interjections which I'm fairly certain they do in cinemas going by the one time I went and watched a thriller with one of them. 

Anyway as a book reader, I really enjoyed it. I was disappointed there was no hypnotic element but eh. 

Either way I feel like it captured the tone of book which for a book like Annihilation is more important than its story (especially when it's a novel light on plot). Sucks not seeing it in theatres.

Am I being taken as insensitive or something? I genuinely think they should find a way to improve closed captions in thrillers or horror films without spoiling the moment for people. I imagine the only workaround would be timing it better.

duqbqq0,"Just saw the film and I really loved it. The ending wasn’t confusing. I actually loved it, but I want to know if other people have theories or if what was shown at the end was definite. 

I personally believe that Natalie Portman’s character died in The Shimmer. Yes, we’re shown otherwise, but I think that the Humanoid thing actually killed Lena and then just told the Hazmats what they want to hear. Everything prior to the climax in the lighthouse is true, but the humanoid chooses to change the ending to the narrative we follow in the film.

I have two reasons for believing this: 
1. The leader of the Hazmats asks her “What did The Shimmer want?” Ventures clearly told Lena in the lighthouse that The Shimmer was going to absorb everything to achieve total Annihilation. Oddly enough, she never tells them that. I think that at the very least she should have told them what Ventress said.
2. Kane’s doppelgänger awakes from his Coma and asks Lena is she is well, Lena, and then the camera cuts away before we get a response. And then what happens? They embrace? If it was indeed Lena at the end, I think the exact opposite would have happened. I think she would have embraced him because she would have finally got a second chance to do things right again. I believe “Kane” embraces Lena’s doppelgänger because he realizes that she isn’t her. She is the only thing that he truly does know: a piece of The Shimmer. 

I know this may seem outlandish, but once again it’s just my theory. I’d love to hear other people’s thoughts. I’m so intrigued by this film. It truly be a landmark in the genre.",7zqsdy
dvmcq6s,"I've seen quite a few analysis of Annihilation, I'm surprised no one mentioned the fact that it looks like the Alien rapes her in the lighthouse, and perhaps this is what caused the biologist to get the shimmer. The scene also mirrors the sex scene when she is having her affair. Perhaps this is allegory for how their marriage broke down. Maybe she tried to end the affair, but the other guy wouldn't say no,  and she became distant because there was something she had to hide from her husband but needed his support. Eventually he found out and thought he couldn't protect her, hence their marriage breaking down.",7zqsdy

Its themes- dying to oneself, dismembering and remembering of the body, becoming one body (in Christ), becoming a new creation, the Shimmer as a womb of sorts that gives birth to the new creation (like the waters of baptism are like the waters in the womb and so give one new life in God), and transformation and the examined life overall as painful and that few survive becoming this new thing- it parallels so many christian themes and philosophical themes more generally that I can certainly appreciate it and what it does for secular audiences.

dur10bo,[deleted],7zqsdy
dvqd4bm,"Read comments and haven't seen anyone mention this yet.

This is my theory:

When not-Kane comes back and Lena touches his hand in the kitchen, seen through the glass of water, there is some kind of transfer here.
She begins to take on the form of non-Lena.
As soon as they touch, non-Kane immediately starts to die (now he is out of the shimmer).

Upon ""Lena"" entering the shimmer we see a scene of sex (her cheating), and immediately afterwards we see bright  light coming through her tent zipper in the morning, which appears as a vagina (to me anyway), which she exits as though she is emerging new, as though the non-Lena has activated (because she's now inside the shimmer).
This would explain why she remained so unaffected inside the shimmer compared to the rest of the team.
The alien type creature plays with her, mimicking her, and only when they touch does the alien take the non-Lena (no 2) form, but this one is then blown up.

Non-Lena (no 1) goes back out into the world seemingly as ""Lena"". She is questioned about her time in the shimmer (right at the beginning of the film), and she answers questions with ""I dont know"" and seems dazed just as non-Kane did in the kitchen.

""Lena"" then goes into see non-Kane, and she asks him if it is him or non-him, and he says not-him. He then asks if she is really ""Lena"", but she stumbles, and remains silent. As they hug, both of their eyes light up.

I think there is also dialogue about a single type cell, and another cell returning to it to make the pair. Which reflects non-Lena heading from dying non-Kane, into the shimmer, to the lighthouse, to then return to non-Kane, to make the pair.

Which also explains how she feels she ""owes it to him"" to go into the shimmer in the first place, because really she needs to get to the lighthouse, encounter the ""being"", then make it back out, to bring non-Kane back from dying, to make the pair, and then....who knows? Carry on repeating? By passing it on to others? Giving birth? Replication like cells.

tl;dr: Lena was non-Lena from the moment she touches non-Kane's hand in their kitchen. He begins dying. She has to go in to the shimmer, to experience the ""being"", to stop him dying, so the two ""cells"" - non-Lena and non-Kane - can then continue replicating, like a virus.",7zqsdy
dvngeno,"The movie is pretty bad but its great science fiction. My big gripe is how often the movie sets something up only to cut it down and trash it.

We start with Lena dealing with grief but then find out Kane isn't dead (in the book the husband dies). Then we go into meeting the team and it is a promising group of people and then we discover they really aren't really trained for the expedition. Lena is ex-military, 7 years is a lot of time and it is set up that she is both executor and observer but she behaves like she has never been through basic training or any service, barely wielding her gun and incorrectly assessing an aggressive crocodile as a threat and barely passes as a biologist. We are set up that the group is dealing with their own issues but that ends up being not important through the course of the story. The movie presents these topics or things and you note these in your head but they end up being unused.

The movie feels like its going somewhere and then it just ends and switches to something else and at the end of the movie there is a completely new plot and nearly everything that happened before or up to that point was just filler and to explain the ending act.

I 'got' the ending after Lena witnesses the two deer and then confirmed it with the Physicist schooling the Biologist on the shimmer and DNA. The rest was unnecessary drama.",7zqsdy

***spoilers for book 3***

showed a comet hit the lighthouse. In the book, that’s how the aliens/whatever they are arrived on Earth. It got trapped in a piece of glass and I believe that when Saul accidentally broke the glass it jumpstarted the creation of Area X. 

While I enjoyed the movie overall, there’s two major changes that bothered me: 1. the biologist cheating on her husband and 2. how easily Area X was destroyed. I don’t remember any mentions of her cheating on her husband in the book? (If I forgot, lmk.) I actually prefer the ambiguous ending of the last book - we don’t know for sure if Area X was destroyed or if the border increased again. 

I found it interesting that the duplicate clone concept wasn’t changed. Wish that they had stuck with the original swamp monster but I guess the bear was the replacement. ",7zqsdy

It's one of those where you don't get a complete answer while it contradicts itself.
I only like the visuals and some creepy unearthly scenes.
The mutations scenes are all interesting. But it cuts off some of them to leave your imagination to figure out. I actually hate this most of the time.

Worm scene and result of it, wow.
The bear, wtfudge.
Needed an extra for kill.
It's like half of them killed off by same thing. The paramedic girl is annoying but got that she brought onto herself. Answers.
You don't get to fully see what happen to plant girl. But it's assumed because of the surrounding.
The leader putting light show a bit cheesy.
I didn't care for main character after finding out she's a cheat.
The final confrontation scene had a very creepy great music going on.
The ET... Ok. It's just okay.
The contradiction is it all may not want anything, yet it's changing things. When you have a will, you want something. You aren't a robot. It surely wanted something be it to explore/discover or to experience anything because of curiosity.
So wtfudge happened to the 2 at the end? They are evolving or ""refracting""? Sorry no answers. Except can only assume it's not over and it's going to continue.

I wanted to see more wierd mutations. Show more to the end. 
When you make a movie like this, it needs to bring us into more of its creativity do we can see things we had haven't before. We only saw some things but it's not enough.
There theme of this all is it's cloning everything yet bending  i in is own way. ""Refraction""

I think I was drawn back because I really liked the idea of it all - the idea of the visuals, the idea of the soundtrack, the idea of the story.  But in practice I've realized it's an utter failure.

There were some visually beautiful scenes - [the light house, the body in the pool](#spoiler).  But they were actually really rare.  Most of it was just forest.  The music was great and this is an incredible soundtrack but really what blew me away were in about the last 30 minutes or so only.  The story has a great premise but falls flat on its face in the film (just bought the book so not judging that).

There are so many problems with the execution of this story that it's difficult to know where to start.  The most blatant cringeworthy moments were when [what's-her-name ties everyone up to chairs, when that other woman walks into the forest, and when the woman at the end is floating with the ""alien"" coming out of her](#spoiler).  It was just really bad.

And the movie was so unbelievably slow.  People compare it to BR2049, but that had some level of tension and story telling going on that kept me interested.  This was just people walking through a forest for the most part.  It was very difficult to remain engaged.

The characters made all kinds of decisions that made you think ""WTF is wrong with them?""  The idea of [DNA ""refracting""](#spoiler) makes no sense at all whatsoever.

dv71auj,"'To me' the message, in Annihilation, is this: Annihilation is a discussion surrounding the inherent destructive nature of ideology.

WARNING: #SPOILERS BELOW THIS POINT!!!

It's no secret that the global political climate has been a tumultuous one, at best. And the current political climate seems to be represented throughout the movie.

General Recap: The Shimmer is an Extraterrestrial organism that, once landing on Earth, created a prism from which to replicate it's surroundings; possibly in an attempt to create an entirely new life form, which is perfectly suited for its new environment.

This prism would also replicate DNA, as well as the -general- structural formations of it's surroundings. This represents -both- the Extraterrestrial Organism's greatest weakness, and greatest strength.

Furthermore, the organism is devoid of ego, and acts in accordance with it's biological necessity: survival. So, the organism meets violence with violence, and 'order' with 'order.'

This is why, after Lena -Natalie Portman- pulls the pin, and hands the organism an white phosphorous grenade, that the organism replicates the destructive nature of the white phosphorous, subsequently destroying itself while attempting to 'control' & replicate the destructive nature of the phosphorous.

My Interpretation: The shimmer is an artistic representation of ideology. Just as the 'Right', and the 'left' dream of a utopian society, created in their own image. This process, leading to their perceived utopia, requires they -each- take a form that best suits their current environment.

And as the challengers of their ideals change, so does it's -The Shimmer- responses to the variety of challengers it -The Shimmer- faces. As the organism grows, it replicates what one can only interpret as a veritable garden of eden. Hence the reason why the shimmer -to me- is representative of, ideology.

However, when Lena hands her 'doppelgänger' the grenade, the organism attempts to adapt to this new, and destructive form, which I interpret as a representation of the violent motivations of both the far Left, and the far Right. These motivations encourage extremists to behave irrationally when faced with an unsolvable problem, the inherent imperfection, and biological unsuitability of the environment it has chosen to inhabit, change, and 'conform' to. -Preposition at the end of a sentence? Sad Face-

The organisms violent end is representative of the temptation for the Alt Right, and Alt Left to adopt violence as a means to further their political ideologies. Ultimately, this results in their self-destruction; this talk of self-destruction is mentioned mid way through the film.

At the end of the movie, we see Lena and Kane embrace. By this point, we now know that Kane is a clone, and the original Kane has taken his own life. The camera zooms in on Lena, and the 'Kane clone' to reveal that not only has Kane 'returned' as the physical embodiment of the Shimmer -ideology-, but Lena has returned with remnants of the Shimmer, which alters Lena's DNA the moment she crosses into the prism. This is a representation of the parts of the ideology, represented by the Shimmer, that Lena has brought back with her. While, much of the whole has disintegrated, the -presumably- more efficient aspects of the organism -ideology- lives on in Lena's body/mind.

Another aspect of the organism that represents ideology, is represented in the idea that the prism prevents outsiders from communicating with those inside the prism; the prism is an 'echo chamber.' No outside ideas are allowed inside the prism, and any outsider who successfully enters the prism -echo chamber- is either destroyed, or forced to conform.

I hope you enjoyed my brief, and scattered interpretation of Annihilation. ",7zqsdy

The film was OK but had no original ideas (especially if you have read Solaris or Roadside Picnic or seen the films that Tartakovsky made of them) and the story held no surprises for a serious science fiction fan (or even just for someone that knows story structure).

I know casting her probably helped sell tickets, but it's a shame that films feel as if they need well-known actors to sell tickets.

Setting up camp in the guard tower but then putting your watchman at the bottom of the tower where they no longer have 360 degree visibility with a nice bright light signalling your presence. Etc.

I enjoyed Arrival so the girlfriend and I went to see it this weekend. We never read the book and I don't know how accurate it is. When [Natalie Portman was in the back of the ambulance with her dying husband and screaming](#spoiler) I decided to check my brain at the door and just hopefully enjoy a good movie. 

After the movie both of us felt like it was fun and entertaining but both had similar issues making us wish we watched something else. Cast was *picked* terrifically but the acting really fell flat for me.Maybe it was the fact that they had to act over a green screen most of the movie. 

The idea of the story was really cool but was bogged down by a lot of nonsense and forced dialogue to help the watcher understand something about what was happening and it felt unnatural and took me out of the movie. Being a paramedic myself I laughed at the fact that they brought one, especially with no equipment. Since they could afford all these brilliant people I thought it was a bit out of place.

I could have really enjoyed it despite these little things though. I'm not really some ""WE GOTTA HAVE HARD SCIENCE EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE ACCURATE"" kind of people and can look past that and enjoy buzzwordy science movies.

What took me out of the movie completely is it felt too much like it was made then rewritten by focus groups and investors to appeal to literally every demographic. We got your sci fi, we got your horror, we got your romance, cool, great now lets off camera say [one cuts herself ones an alcoholic one has cancer one lost her daughter. Now lets throw in some urban outfitters coachella shit and have a girl start sprouting leaves and turning into a tree](#spoiler) like some 16 year old girls diary fantasy Oh animals with flowers on their antlers yeah maybe that will hit the YA books crowd.

I don't know how much the movie reflects the book but I think in the end we valued the fun we had talking about how much we disliked it more than the time we spent watching it.

The Cinematography is very shoddily done with unintentionally poor lighting, very badly angled shots, and looks like they were almost intentionally working not to get a view of anything that would look remotely visually interesting. They filmed the team putting down their backpacks 27 times over the course of the movie, and that seems to have been their primary focus over the course of the film.

This movie is OVERWHELMINGLY first and foremost Boring, like I said this is basically ""Put Down Your Backpack: THE MOVIE"", as other than 6 minutes worth of other scenes that is literally the most that happens. You could EASILY cut this movie down to 20 minutes without changing a single plot point, as the vast majority of it is quite literally awkward unnatural small talk filler, and putting down backpacks.

NO ONE smiles over the course of this entire movie, not a single time, most don't even speak, and just glare angrily at each other for no real reason, it's almost like they were being charged by the word by their actors, and as a result were trying to short change them, and the actors were all pissed off about it. When actors DO speak it is typically inane filler talk that makes no logical sense, and sounds like what a robot would think normal people would talk about. The soundtrack consists entirely of the sound BRRRNG...BRRRNG....BRRRNG... repeated incessantly over the course of the entire 2 hours. 

This movie has like 3 still frames that could maybe make a cool looking poster, and that is the full extent of anything positive it contributes to society, I mean HOLY FUCK, how the hell did this even make it to theaters like this? The 6 total minutes of half interesting action in this movie relies strictly on gore to generate any excitement, which would had been fine if the rest of the movie was not literally ""Nothing running in slow mo"".

I didn't love how all the characters from the book were characterized here, but I think it would have been tough for them to do.  The psychologist's personality felt closest to how it was described in the book, but her changed motivations hurt the character a lot.

I'm not an engineer, but working in STEM, my opinion is the director did a shoddy work on the premise.

So many other plot holes and just inconsistencies.

1. So you've sent several teams in and none have returned.  Have you thought of using an invention called ROPE? tie rope around each person and slowly enter? Pull them out after 5 minutes, repeat with longer rope...

2. The smartest scientists are recruited and we have seen that the shimmer hinders electronics. Yet none of them bothered to record their first day on invention called PEN AND PAPER?  Somehow they wake up with nothing to recall what they did the first 2 days or so.
Even my first grade 2 science class we knew to write it down...

3. So may be its me. But I don't know any top scientists that lug around AR15 rifles. I think a scientist would instead negotiate a contract to hire competent special forces to handle perimeter and security for the team to protect the REAL scientists. 

4. The film felt like an extended commercial for AR15 rifles. I know films get product placement. But I wonder how much money the producers got from the gun firm.

5. I didn't like the ending. It felt like the writer ran out of ideas on how to wrap it up. [Oh shit how do I end this? Ah FIRE, lots of fire. THE END](#spoiler)

Not a terrible movie, but it was slow and would have left a theater crowd with a puzzled look of what the hell they watched for 2 hours.  I think it'll get more views on Netflix with a more forgiving audience.  Some of my petty gripes with the movie: 

* Why have an all-female cast like a serious version of Ghostbusters 2016?  It sticks out like a sore thumb.  An elite military unit goes in and only one soldier comes back.  Let's send in 4 female civilians/scientists and give them AR-15 rifles?  Portman was the only one with real military experience, but she was not part of the initial team.  This would seem unrealistic even for a girls-only camping trip.  It's a pretty good sign that it wasn't going to be a sci-fi action movie.

* Did they have to throw in the black dude fucking Portman?  Really?  Let's not only make her have an affair, let's be hip and edgy and show her riding a black dude, cowgirl style.  Was that fan service to the hipster liberal audience that they were targeting with this movie?  It's a sci-fi movie.  Couldn't they just allude to her having an affair?  Why did this movie seem like a drama about relationships and girl issues?

* They enter into the shimmer and have no recollection of how long they were there or how far they travelled.  My immediate reaction was, go back out, tied a long rope around yourselves, and go back in.  Didn't they have any reconnaissance reports for the years it was there?  No robotic probes?  No electronic equipment works inside?  But they could watch videos on a digital camera?  Also, radios and cell phones aren't the only way to communicate to the outside world.  

* Did the lab experts discover any mutations in her husband?  I thought the alien life mutated existing cells like a virus, not cloned them.  Just seemed like another boneheaded move with regard to isolation/quarantine protocols just like in the movie, Life.",7zqsdy

The overall film wasn't as creative as one would think - it's no bastion of beauty as some would like to claim. I could tell some of the sets were made from spray-painted foam.

Annahilation was just BORING. It felt like lazy directing. These types of movies styled in the mindset of'Just let the audience make their own explanation' are toss they are not intriguing as their is too much open endedness to be satisfying.

Self-destruction is also shown and correlated with Portman and her husband's character. We are our own enemies and our actions are what ultimately end us.

The alien substance transformed the land in monstrous and/or beautiful ways. I think that is the nature of transformation, it is *nature* chaotic yet logical.

Some kind of ""self-destruction"" might be a necessary part of that process, if one needs to shed parts of themselves that hold back progress. It also requires facing your anger and deepest anxieties.

dvpn7bm,"I read your comment until I saw where it was going and wanted to reply before finishing so as to not conflate your comprehension with my own.

I just finished watching it for the first time. When she made it to the light house it hit me that the object landing at the light house was not a coincidence, the writer is telling us this is a beacon. The exact word “beacon” was even used shortly after.

Then I began searching for the actual story being told — if this is the beacon, who are the sailors? Who is it calling? Lighthouses were reprieve. How is this reprieve? It came on pretty heavily when I considered all of the flashbacks. The story is of Lena and Kane’s relationship.

I haven’t fully fleshed everything out, but some of what I have (in list mode to avoid a wall of text):

* The catalyst for the Shimmer was Lena cheating on Kane.

* The Shimmer is this period in their relationship.

* The beacon/lighthouse is the act of addressing her actions. This has to be in order to move past her betrayal. They have to find the lighthouse for a chance of finding reprieve.

* Kane is not the man he was, and her actions have permanently changed him.

* Lena is still the same person, and she has to live with her choices.

* When she faces her transgression and denies the chance to reject responsibility, she pulls them through the Shimmer, being that Kane had already confronted it.

* The catalyst can be seen as destroying everything, or as changing things, as creating something new. Something weird. Something scary. Some beautiful. Something unknown.

* He is not the man he was. She is who she has always been, and she carries the weight.

Going to go back and read the rest of your comment now. I really like my interpretation wether or not it aligns with the writer’s intent. It elevates the movie quite a bit, for me at least.

Edit: Are you me? Nah, but really, I saw the movie the same as you did. I do feel like the story is tailored and centric to Kane and Lena, and so then is the Shimmer. But, I like the expanded idea that the Shimmer represents an inner conflict to all who enter it. That would really give the opportunity to expand the stories of the other characters — but none of them made it out, which takes me back to them all being fodder for Kane and Lena’s story. I’d like to read the book. I’ve heard the first book is great, but the sequels not so much.",7zqsdy

dv794lj,"Beautiful analysis of the film. It's a wonderful, profound treatise on personal growth, the nature of human relationships, all wrapped up in a glossy package of existential horror and transcendent science fiction. 

One of the best films that I've ever seen. ",7zqsdy
duxyrzy,"I just got back from my first viewing and I love your analysis. I think it is spot on except one detail.  When Lena and Kane hug at the end, they both have knowing, but ultimately distant expressions on their face. This is because Lena did not commit to her metamorphosis. She resisted the change by defeating her mimic and returned still as her original self. Obviously affected by her journey but overall unchanged. Their embrace was as empty as any couple who hugs because they feel they should when in reality there is nothing there.",7zqsdy
dvpb6av,"This is a great analysis, though I have a couple additions. I think your reading and the self-destruction reading aren't really at odds with each other. I think part of the point that the movie is making is that the shimmer is destroying things, just as the characters are destroying parts of their lives. But in the context of the film I don't think that destruction implies a negative, or even a value judgement at all. Rather, I think the film is postulating that that cycle--or maybe it's better characterized as a spectrum?--of destruction and creation is simply natural, something that should be accepted as a part of being alive.

I don't think the annihilation really refers to the broken parts of the past, mostly because the changes the characters and environment are often superficial--a tattoo, a southern accent, the several additional rows of teeth on the crocodile, the deer with flowers growing from its horns. None of those are constructive changes, they're just changes, gleaned from things in proximity to each other. The shimmer's ""goal"" (insofar as it has one) seems to simply be change--change everything, completely and fully, until nothing is left as it was and the world no longer exists in its previous form. Leaving the world that we knew ""annihilated.""

What's implied to me by the final moments of the film is that not only are Kane and Lena in new forms, their previous forms no longer exist. All they were is gone, and all they are is the creatures that are the product of the shimmer's changes, recreations, and rebirths.",7zqsdy
dvinxx2,"Exactly my thought. I looked up the word ""annihilation"" and found out that it's actually a psychological term. To start off, why would you even have a psychiatrist onsite for this kind of mission? Everything in the movie seems very symbolic and metaphorical to me. ",7zqsdy
dvy0g4o,"> I came away this time with a pretty strong sense of what it was really about on a higher level.

I mean, everything you've said is spot on, absolutely. However, the movie straight-up tells us exactly what you've said, in exposition. This isn't some difficult, impossible metaphor. Characters blatantly talk about change and killing the past to move forward as new.

For fucks sake, she crawls out of the alien birth canal hole after giving birth to a new self, which she confronts and overcomes. It could not be **more** on the nose.

This movie is beautiful, ambitious, colorful, hallucinogenic, and well-done. However, it's not subtle, not in the least.",7zqsdy
dvf4xsf,"This is one of the most thoughtful posts I've read about this movie. You mentioned that when times of struggle and transformation come, it's up to each individual how much to resist and struggle against change, and how much to accept it.

I can see some of that in every character of the movie and have some sense of the message it's attempting, except for the physicist girl who walks away from Lina and seems to disappear into the humanoid plants. 

I haven't seen anyone in this thread mention that woman and her departure from the story in this thread and would love to hear your thoughts on the symbolism of it. ",7zqsdy

dvn92u4,"And you know what?

The Kane clone didn't take water that good. But since the mutation was already observed, the newly cloned Lena doesn't have the effects of it.",7zqsdy
dvneghw,"Great analysis of the themes. My only comment is I believe that the Kane that returns to the house is the same Kane that went into the Shimmer to begin with. 

The Kane that burns himself says ""I thought I was a man"" ... ""people called me Kane so that's who I thought I was"". I thought that was a heavy handed way to say the clone perished, and being a mimic of the real person probably had some fears of the original which caused him to suicide. 

I think it still perfectly fits your themes and he did indeed shed off the ""negative"" properties he once had, just that they manifested strongly in his clone. The clone then knowing he was not the original would serve as a proper mirror and allow the original to learn from it and return to Lena something else.",7zqsdy
dvzdx7c,"Yeah I agree with you. My interpretation is that there’s some sort of Buddhist idea behind the shimmer... (even the name sounds like entering some sort of Nirvanic state). Autodestruction of self-identity to become a part of a whole... which kind of explains the metaphor of the prism effect that the atmosphere has. It’s not that species are evolving in this movie, it’s that everything is becoming a single entity.
Those ideas are foreshadowed and mirrord throughout the film. Conversations of self-destruction as an impulse driven by our own DNA. Kane questioning his own identity as a man and as an entity named Kane. Kane’s self inmolation.",7zqsdy
dw4jxxe,"I'm going to admit I didn't read all of your comment. Maybe because I too saw that as well and didn't need further deconstruction of it. But I did want to point out that the way the movie itself was made is also reflected in the idea of personal change. Alex Garland only read the manuscript once apparently, and used the original book as a loose foundation for his creation. He took something... and made it completely new, just as the shimmer did.

dwanohn,"You’ve summarised the film beautifully, I really hope one day I’ll be as articulate as you. 

One thing I want to add is that at the end I was sure Lena and the Kane clone were going to be killed by Lomax’s team, and that Lena knew this but Kane’s clone didn’t, and she was going in to die with him - Lena’s character is portrayed as smart, if she knew she that her and Kane were the last remaining “carriers” of whatever the shimmer was then she’d willingly be ‘exterminated’ because she’d understand that she and him were a threat to life on earth.

After reading these comments, I have changed my mind and I think they survive now. They’re examples of people making the best of a bad situation - integrating how they coped with the change into their lives, having been effected by the rapid change characteristic of the shimmer but having improved upon it because it was just expanding + changing too fast, what’s left of it in Kane and Lena isn’t dangerous and cancerous like the alligator/bear. It’s just part of what they are now and they’re better off than they were before they went into the shimmer, having resolved their relationship issues.

I like the film because I agree that a little bit of self destruction can be a catalyst for positive change - getting a bit tipsy with friends and talking out issues like a break up is therapeutic and overall good for you, despite the negative health effects of a bit of alcohol. This is shown with Kane and Lena at the end for me. The bear and the alligator are the equivalent of drinking away your problems and doing real damage to your liver etc - they’re sorry looking creatures; an illustration of how self destructive behaviour can sometimes be necessary but is just awful when taken too far.",7zqsdy

dv5p8yi,"There were a few of those scenes for me. Cutting dude’s stomache open to play with his worm intestines was crazy as shit, but then seeing the result in the pool was easily as crazy just for how great it looked. That was some a+ sci fi horror imagery. This movie was metal as fuck, and I appreciate that. ",7zqsdy

durhcih,"I loved the inclusion of that book in the flashback, definitely was fitting ",7zqsdy
duucxbu,"I believe the theme of this movie is what looks terrible to you (how the cells that killed Henrietta would appear to her), could be good for a lot of other things in the system. Another example is when the animals feed on the scientists. The animals are just doing that to create something new, like a horrific screaming bear. Another is annihilation, it may seem scary to you, but the movie suggests it's a natural process of biology's systems and you should accept it. 


The boyfriend feared thinking like a system (his mind was flowing) and so he killed himself. I believe this was a representation of ego death, as the ego is the only thing that fears selfless systemic thinking (the ""we are all one"" way of thinking; enlightenment). I believe the infinite alien anus represents your consciousness, as many people believe that consciousness at it's baseline or in it's pure form, is an infinite consciousness state. 


The mimicry is a metaphor for how your consciousness mimics what it experiences in the real world. An example of this is how dreams mimic the real world. If you strip all of the mimicry away, you experience the baseline infinity state of consciousness. I believe this movie is promoting to strip all of your preconceived notions, or mimicry, away  and think systemically.",7zqsdy
durpjc0,WOW. I knew a bit about the book and I had done a *lot* of thinking about the Physicist's speech before she walked into the trees. But I didn't realize how they are connected in such a profound way. This is an amazing connection. ,7zqsdy
duuepoz,"This is doubly true when considering that the cells shown dividing in her lecture at the beginning were, in her words, ""female cervical cancer cells"" and were most likely HeLa cells.",7zqsdy
duxrsf3,"The part that struck me was the part you quoted: ""it must be horrible to die scared and in pain and only having your screams of fear live on as the only remnant of you"". 

As somebody who has seen a lot of family die of cancer, this line struck me hard. The one thing they feared the most was being remembered (having their last remnant) be of their pain and suffering. Of those last agonizing moments before the disease took them. The bear was that fear in the flesh. And it made it all the more terrifying to me. 

I need to read these books now. ",7zqsdy
duvkbsw,"Nice catch. Heard them interview Lacks’ daughter on npr, maybe this American life, and they were tortured by this idea of her mom being those cells. She was concerned her mom’s soul was trapped in the cells and that she could never really be at peace while the cells remained. If I remember right she even had questions about if her mom/the cell could feel pain and was it in pain?",7zqsdy

duyqdo7,"At times, the dialogue was goofy, but all of the actors were amazing. For Natalie Portman, on top of the scene you mentioned, the one was she starts heavily sobbing once she is on her own was amazing. Also, imagine being Oscar Isaac and having to act out coughing up blood and having a seizure. 

Plus, Gina Rodriguez did panic so well, especially during the scene where they are tied up to chairs. Tessa Thompson was so good at going back and forth between fear and acceptance.

I think the humanoid was Lena's mirror self in that scene, and I think the dual role is very fitting since it draws a parallel between the student, learning from Lena, and the avatar of the 'shimmer' studying her in the lighthouse.  Even though it was CGI with inhuman proportions you could definitely tell that someone was actually there interacting with Natalie Portman, just based on how she reacted to it.  You could feel the weight when it pushed against her and the delicate emotion as it mimicked her unconscious pose.  The movie was a masterclass in special effects.  Old school mixed with the new.  ",7zqsdy
dv703sk,Every single thing that took place in that lighthouse was some of the absolute most surreal shit I've ever seen in my life. Alex Garland must've had some hellish nightmares to have come up with such skin crawling imagery.,7zqsdy

duqxuz5,I took it more as Ventress had wandered out to the stand on her own. When Lena comes out of the tower she looks around the side to see where Ventress is and only then does she notice that there was a light out in the stand. I thought it was just another example of Ventress feeling like she was running out of time and wanting to know more so she went exploring during her guard shift. ,7zqsdy
duqbmcd,Same!! It made no sense. It was like they wanted to be eaten. At least maybe Shepherd did since she could’ve at least entered the guard shed instead of standing there. ,7zqsdy

""Oh no, using my night vision specs i can see something ripped through the fence. Let me put down my fucking night vision goggles and aim my gun into the dead, unforseen night!""

And yes their whole setup was a bit odd. As others have said maybe it was tying into the idea of self-destruction. I thought it had more to do with characters sort of being off kilter. But even if you buy into those explanations the scene felt like it could have been better conveyed. ",7zqsdy

 How could it be her house though?",7zqsdy
dvkap2u,I think she was an unreliable narrator and that's how she thinks of houses.,7zqsdy
dusd5x7,Yeah it looked like the same house. When Thorensen attacked her in her sleep I thought she found something in the house that clued her in. But then it was just her pendant. Also when they first enter the house IIRC she kind of paused as if she recognized it. ,7zqsdy
duqve59,Wow good catch it does look like it. I'll need to watch it again to confirm ,7zqsdy

duq9s02,Ed...ward,7zqsdy
durufig,"The scream bear scene is where the major metaphor dawned on me. The shimmer is cancer (obviously) but the characters all represent different approaches to dealing with it. 
The scream bear represents the how people remember someone suffering through chemo. Her character had lost a daughter to leukemia and mentioned how it basically killed her former self. She represents fighting and losing painfully, dying in misery and your family and friend’s memory of you is forever replaced by your final pain. 
The physicist represented those who chose not to fight and suffer. Ultimately she dies, but without pain, and peacefully and she leaves behind a pleasant memory. 
The psychologist represents the psychologic trauma and depression that cancer victims have. 
The EMT represents denial. She accuses the others of inventing the bear, and just wants to “go back” but there is no going back.  Additionally, she has a substance abuse past, probably a call to those who turn to addiction or self medicating. 
The biologist represents intellecualizing the situation. A defense mechanism where people just try to keep gathering information, and think if they can understand it, they can regain control. 

When she escapes, she is kept in isolation, a common thing for cancer patients. The scientist interviewing her with all the young scientist watching are like residents on rounds in a hospital. 

The clones represent how nobody is ever the same after surviving cancer. The anthroplogist who’s daughter died of leukemia said as much earlier in the film. 

Finally, her and Kane at the end represent how even a tiny bit of remaining cancer can restart the whole process. They metastasized away from the primary tumor, and though the primary tumor was destroyed, they cancer threat remains.

I've heard/read it in several different versions, pretty much every long horror story series has a version of it. Most recent was the famous horror podcast Magnus Podcast. One of the early episodes named ""angler fish"", which isn't exactly a voice if I recall but it plays on the same thing.

I hadn't considered just how much of a tragic love story this is. 

I wonder if your conclusion is right? That it can't be saved? The Kane she loved is gone? 

I have the sense that they are going to start a new relationship, as the new versions of themselves. They are going to have a more enlightened, honest relationship. Kane can't remember the details of who he was . That's OK. Lena can't remember things either. Because the parts of themselves that were, potentially, in relationship, were the shadow selves. 

It seems to me that they have an opportunity to be in harmonious relationship. Whether that means they end up together or not, who knows? 

Isn't there a shot of the water glass with the two droplets coming together? Maybe that symbolizes their purity joining?

I read that Alex decided to keep the ending to this movie despite pleas from the producing company, or whoever it is that's in charge of marketing. Unfortunately it may have contributed to the financial deficit this movie racked up, but jesus... so glad he kept true to his vision, because his vision is sharp as all hell.

Personally, I am sad that a lot of discussion around the movie is esoteric, because the more the merrier, but... well, I can't add anything new to that sentiment. It is what it is. It's a happy sadness. lmao",7zqsdy

In those few days we learn that there really isn't any love in the marriage], and the movie is all about her journey of dependence despite being wildly capable of handling herself. ",7zqsdy
dutgx9z,Kudos.  Thank you for your very interesting take of the Shimmer as depression.  But it does seem to make sense as one of the many metaphors in the movie.  Some people describe depression as a dark cloud over them or being in a dark hole where perception and memory are distorted.  Sometimes one has to let go of the past destructive self in order to move on.  Yes sometimes we are our own worst enemy for change.   ,7zqsdy

It's like the interpretations are each of the creatures that make up that screambear and the movie is that screambear.

Good write-up!",7zqsdy
dw437o2,"I quite like this take, I had some kind of cyclical depression and the worst (and what I believe to have been the final one) lasted almost 2 years. I definitely felt like I had died somewhere back there and after the black cloud went away I had to rebuild myself, but couldn't quite put everything back together the way it was.

In a way you shouldn't perfectly recreate yourself, because that was the you who got depressed in the first place. In the months after depressive periods I believe we have a chance to undergo psychological shifts and adapt, but its understandable that a combination of ego and pain will make someone just want to return back to when times were good.

I don't think its easy, but its easier to do than a normal person who has so much going on in their head and a lack of incentive to change. Depression on the other hand kind of wipes the slate clean, and then you just need to find something in life to strive towards.",7zqsdy
dvzec3w,"As an alternate yet complimenting interpretation; I think there’s some clear Buddhist symbolism and ideas behind the movie and the shimmer is a metaphor for Nirvana.

There’s the idea in Buddhism that to truly reach Nirvana and feel as a whole with the universe you first need to self-destruct... forget about your notions about what is your self-entity. Which is almost on the nose with Kane questioning his existence and self-inmolating (a strong buddhist symbol).

The “shimmer” doesn’t want to destroy earth but to make it into a single harmonic entity. Plant girl seems to get it before everyone else.

dvolaqj,Me too thanks,7zqsdy
dur4des,"Thank you!  This is what i believed the ending to be as well.  I keep reading explanations and interpretations online that think Lena died in the shimmer and her duplicate made it out.  The whole reason the shimmer was destroyed in the end was because she wasn't a self destructive person like the rest of the team.  As you said the rest of the team was chosen by the doctor possibly because of their self destructive tendencies or perhaps she unconsciously chose people similar to herself (dying and not wanting to return).  This is also why the military teams never made it out: as soldiers who are constantly facing their mortality they would have to come to terms with death on a daily basis.  However, Lena was an unintentional last minute addition who had a reason to live or go on.  ",7zqsdy

duq5xg4,"I hadn't the book but I was glad that I knew it was a trilogy going in because I would have been so confused by the ending. I mean I was confused anyway, but I feel like the movie definitely set itself up for more.

Do you think it's worthwhile to read the books after watching the film?",7zqsdy
duqvj9r,"I'm going to piggyback this comment to see if someone else can discuss this with me - but is anyone else willing to talk about *bad* parts of the movie?

I really enjoyed it. Particularly the audio/visual aspects, and particularly the last ~30 minutes, and some of the themes.

But I think ""writing"" wise, in terms of like, storyline, and the plot itself, it was a little ho-hum, and kind of absurd sometimes. I'm very much able to suspend my sense of disbelief, but when a bunch of supposed normal humans start talking about things in a way that just sounds dumb I can't help but find it jarring.

Some examples.

1) Why is ""researching"" the shimmer never discussed. Like did they never decide to poke it with a stick, and then examine the stick under a microscope? Or did they never tie a camera to a stick, put it in and take it out? Or did they never just walk in, look around for 5 minutes, and come out? I mean this has been going on for years and it's just kind of ""yeah we just keep walking people in but no one comes back"". Or why not just drop a small bomb on the lighthouse? Or why not drive through it with a vehicle? Or run a physical connection? Or walk in with a rope around you? There's SO MANY OPTIONS HERE.

2) I thought there was *too much* explaining, especially given the artistic, lofty ending. Don't tell me it's ""refracting DNA"", that's too specific an answer. I didn't like that they kept referencing science specifically. I wanted more general, lofty explanations and less ""THE PLANTS ARE USING THE WHATEVER (HOZ? I forget) DNA TO LOOK LIKE PEOPLE WOAH"". Specifically the main character and physics girl whenever they get all ""hue hue smart words time"".

3) I didn't like that the one paramedic girl was able to subdue and tie up 3 other people, and I thought it served essentially no purpose to the story. Her character really did nothing but bother me, and if I imagine the movie without her it seems better.

4) Although I **LOVED** everything towards the ending, the bit at the very end where they both have a ""shimmer"" in their eye was kind of confusing to me. It was clear that her ""real"" husband died inside, and the ""copy"" came out. Her copy died inside, and the ""real"" her came out, although the ""real"" her was now somehow affected by shimmer. But is it supposed to just not matter? Is that the ""point""? I kind of wish, personally, it was just him that was ""special now"", and that when she killed it all the stuff inside of her would die too, and then maybe she starts trying to... I dunno', like let him become part of their world normally? Or something?

I should say, I **loved** the movie. A lot of the themes throughout, and in particularly the visuals, from both sets to cinematography, as well as the soundtrack and editing, were all absolutely superb. Everything was pretty good, and towards the end I was absolutely glued to the screen and loving it. But I definitely felt like some areas were weak, and just didn't see it discussed anywhere here yet.",7zqsdy
dur0kkc,"I felt the movie was confusing. Things that made no sense, loose ends that never were resolved. 

Why did everything light on fire? What was the significance of the affair? If that clone mirrored her, why did it force her up against the door and not let her leave? Why is time altered in the shimmer? It seemed they forgot the first 4 days but remembered everything else. I'm confused. 

Oh and the worst part. Youre in a guard tower, why the hell would you go to ground level to keep watch at night?

If you know the answers please let me know.

My interpretation was that they were not humans, really, anymore. What came out of The Shimmer were the copies that were made in the lighthouse. But you are right in that they realize they should be together to reproduce the new life forms they now are. I think there was a reason that copy Kane fully recovered once copy Lena was created and left. 

What I also loved about the movie and how the narrative evolved was that I began to really question what Natalie Portman was saying to Benedict Wong. Because there's no way to verify any of what she said really. So who knows if that is really how the lighthouse scene played out.

Kane was cheated on despite Lena seeming very happy with him. I don't know her motives and I'm not sure why she would do that, especially if they had their affair around when Kane was supposed to leave for his mission. 

The whole self destruction/suicide conversation that Lena and Ventress are talking about in the middle of the film outside the tower gives a lot of insight into why Kane would go on such a dangerous mission. 

Maybe he left early because he switched ops to go on more of a suicide mission. Maybe he commits suicide with the phosphorus grenade because he can't escape or he feels he has nothing left to live for anyway. 

I think he knew going into the Shimmer would almost definitely end in his death, and he's definitely lost it a bit based on how he's ""reacting"" with his mannerisms and facial expressions when the video is shown of him cutting that guy open. He dumps the knife afterward and smiles at the camera. That scene creeped me out not just because of the gore, but after seeing the movie I realized that a very innocent man who wanted nothing more than to love his wife and be with her forever was now insane, dead, and with a doppleganger/clone that will take over his life and his place in the world.

Why didn't they go by boat? It's a lighthouse on a beach, would be pretty easy to just drive a boat right up to it in 10 minutes.

They mentioned drones fail after going into the shimmer, I assume meaning their signal dies and they don't get to recover any footage... why didn't they just sent buoys with a physical cable to gather data?

Why didn't they set up a hardline in their old base and allow the shimmer to pass over it, so that they could have scientific instruments taking readings from the inside?

Why did they only send in 1 team once year? They mention Kane's team was the previous most team to go in... that was over a year ago...

There was 1 great scene in this movie, and 3-4 with gorgeous visuals.  That's it.  That's everything of value.  The dialogue is laughable, the acting is laughable, the exposition is laughable. I am truely baffled.


Every single piece of dialogue in this movie is so melodramatic it becomes absurd.  


Every single character's emotions and every single piece of exposition is put on cue cards and said aloud to make sure we stupid morons who are watching don't miss anything.  This entire movie sounds like it was half written by a 13 year old and half by a homeless guy on acid.  It's 'beautiful message of self-destruction'  is the most heavy handed bullshit I've ever seen in a movie.  You could literally run this entire script through the Deepak Chopra quote generator and you would get the same result.


'We are all broken into fragments until the pieces we are left with become the nothingness we have long awaited'.


'You don't hate me, you hate yourself'


'Aren't we all just searching for the same things that make us who we are?'


The amount of useless lines delivered in this movie is hilarious.  'Look a camera'  'it should work' 'let's try it out' 'it's working'.


Natalie Portman doesn't have much to work with here, but she does a fairly poor job with what she's given.  The scene with her and Isaac playfully bantering in bed is some of the worst acting I've ever seen.  There is not a single moment in this film where you are not aware that she is an actress.


Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance is so ridiculous and over-the-top it's almost impossible to take her character seriously.  There isn't a single good acting performance in this entire movie.  There isn't a single piece of good dialogue in this movie.


The canoeing scene with Tuva Novotny listing off each cliched character's backstory, literally spelling out their absurdly dark histories one-by-one is so ridiculous I physically could not stop laughing.


The editing in this movie is so jarring it's impossible to care about anything.  This was their intent in most places, but it's useless in others and it ruins any sense of continuity and ability to care about anything.  Can't wait for the How Did This Get Made episode on this because it's impossible to watch without wondering if it's all just a parody.

It could have to do with love and pain felt by the affair? But the pregnancy makes sense to me and the line “I saw you in the room with the bed” 

It was bound to War of the Worlds itself(Cancer). It had to duplicate itself to survive and since there was only one it couldn’t cross breed with us. But a mutated human could give birth to something new?

The movie does most things better than the book, but one change I did not like was her motivation. In the book, she mainly goes out of curiosity.  
She knows the place drove her husband to the state he was in, and believes that she could handle the change, due to their different psychological states. She has a whole back story about losing herself in these contained ecosystems. She is literally called ""the biologist"" in the book. It is a large part of her character.  
She is infinitely curious about Area X, and that is her main drive to keep going. (And she got infected by the ""brightness"", but whatever.)

The Lena that comes out is a shimmer clone.

She is probably lying about the entire ending. The grenade maybe happened, but it ""destroying"" the shimmer is misinformation. The shimmer used it's newfound understanding between Ventress and Lena to disappear, but I say it's definitely still there. 

As Ventress says, it's going to incorporate humanity until we're more shimmer than human, then cease to exist. Because that's how it thinks it needs to react to humanity's aggression.

I'm honestly disappointed we didn't see more weird creatures in the Shimmer, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

If they wanted, stick a few mice in cages tied to ropes right at the edge of the shimmer and allowing to it envelope them before pulling them out at different intervals would have quickly made clear to scientists there that something weird was going on with the mice cells. This could have been fixed by simply allowing the military to know at least this problem with the shimmer.

Whether it's the alien or not, the Lena that arrives back outside of the Shimmer isn't the one that went in, she'd be too a) traumatized and/or b) mutated by her exposure. So that means the two theories can coexist: it's her, but it's not. Whether or not it's because of the mutation or she was literally replaced (by a being that has adopted most of her DNA, it's important to note) is almost irrelevant.",7zqsdy
duqvqp2,Can you expand more on what he’s teaching the thing?,7zqsdy
dv5pzh1,"My interpretation is that it's still Lena but she now carries influences of whatever ""The Shimmer"" is with her. As for if it's something in the background or more of a combined consciousness is harder to say. Obviously this is most apparent in the final scene where both Kane and Lena's iris shimmers.

I had a different interpretation of the phosphorous grenade though. I think Kane was surrendering to the madness of The Shimmer. ""My mind is... cut loose, and I can't bear it. I can't bear it."" I'll elaborate more below on my thoughts on the phosphorous grenade but it's a bit lengthy.

To me the alien creature was trying to create and understand something rather than mutating everything caught within the shimmer. It takes a drop of Lena's blood and from there mimics the structure.

After it forms and Lena shoots it, it begins to mirror her movements. Then it started to mirror her behaviors. One of the most interesting parts during the ""interview"" part of the movie is when Lena says the creature only attacked her because she was trying to attack (I forget the exact line, but it essentially implied that the creature was copying behavior/motives).

When Lena goes for the door, I'm not sure whether to interpret this as the creature mimicking rushing the door, or understanding Lena's intentions to escape and wanting to keep her there to continue learning to complete the transformation.

Now we're at the second point where Lena regains consciousness around the creature and one thing that's interesting to note is that the creature has a slightly different resting position than Lena. Lena is resting the palm of her hand on the ground while the creature is resting it's forearm there.

AND NOW TO THE PHOSPHOROUS GRENADE. So at this point we've established that the creature has a basic behavioral understanding. My initial thoughts on the phosphorous grenade were that the creature understood simply that Lena wanted to hold the phosphorous grenade, but why did it not run when Lena did? Was it disoriented from the transformation into Lena similar to how it stood there after being shot during it's initial transformation?

After watching the movie a second time, I think it was something else entirely. I think once the creature finished it's transformation, it started to get at least a base level adaptation of Lena's motivations. The notable one here being the desire to fight the shimmer (Radek points this out before disappearing into plant land).

We also see this base level motivation with the Kane mimic's desire to seek out Lena. Not to mention the fact that it seemingly just happened to appear inside the house, which is a whole other topic that I have thoughts on after reading through some of the comments in this thread.

But yeah ultimately I think the Lena being interviewed is the original, but carries traces of the shimmer with her. As for how much, how it affects her, and the other implications of it, who knows. We see that near the end, both her and Crazy Anya have the infinity tattoo from Swimming Pool guy. Another person in this thread mentioned that when she drinks from the glass of water, one water trail splits into two. I definitely noticed the camera focused on the water trail but wasn't entirely sure what I was meant to be noticing. 

I'm really curious as to what other subtle things are hidden within this movie. It will be interesting when it comes out on Netflix and people are easily able to rewatch and hop around the movie.",7zqsdy

I think the entire film is an allegory for cancer treatment. At least the things that happen in the shimmer is all a series of allegories for dying of cancer, and the lighthouse is an allegory for cancer treatment (phosphorus radiation). The shimmer is essentially a cosmic tumor that bends reality the way a glass of water bends light. 

The way all the characters die seems to represent the way people go through cancer treatment: 

* Sheppard puts on a brave face despite knowing her fate will be the same as everyone else's. Yet when death catches her by surprised the last anyone hears from her is her cries for help.

* Anya turns her back on her team out of weakness of character (I don't mean this as an insult to the film). I think the subtle implication is that some people get cancer from their vices and the discomfort of treatment can turn a person crazy.

* Josie decides to let her cancer just run its natural course and leaves behind a flowery grave. 

* Ventress, who has *literal* cancer, is so consumed by her desire to understand what the cancer wants that by the time she's found out it's already consumed her.

* Lena reads as an allegory both for a cancer patient, and for a wife of a cancer patient. There is a beautiful wide shot of Natalie Portman staring herself in the eye with a lit grenade in her hands. It's a beautiful visual allegory for killing a part of you, self-destructing so to speak. 

I've also heard from others that while undergoing treatment people experience the same effects of people that enter the shimmer: they lose time, they stop eating, they feel their guts move, etc etc. 

I definitely love how this movie creates this kind of discourse.

Lena's affair was her husband's (Kane) motivation for going into the shimmer in what's essentially a suicide mission.  It ties into the main theme of the human pathology for self-destruction.  (In this case the self-destruction of a relationship.)

This is specifically referenced in a few scenes, especially in the scene where Lena asks the psychologist for a profile of Kane and why he volunteered to enter the shimmer.

dvilnwn,"> The shimmer is distorting everything in an attempt to find perfection

Tbh I tend to agree with what Lena says at the end. The shimmer isn't attempting anything and may not have been ""aware"" of anything let alone self-aware. It's just there and doing what it's doing, which is refracting/mutating just about everything as well as continually growing (not necessarily everything within it, but the shimmerspace in general). Even Dr. V alludes to that when she mentions earlier in the movie that it's more up Lena's alley, that they're dealing with impulses, which are like reactions without thought.

The only motivations it has seem to be what is refracted, and in the tunnel, at its core, it's refracting most what it's directly interacting with to the point that it creates the mimic. And what does the mimic do? React without thought.

So few even make it to the core and Kane and Dr. V were both there on a ""suicide mission"" so they both basically resigned themselves to this thing before they ever got to it let alone when they encountered it. Lena was the only one with a motivation to make it out alive, and especially once she realizes her husband blew himself up and his mimic was what made it out, her motivation to destroy it is what ultimately ends up causing it to not just sit there after the grenade goes off, but go back to its core and fully destroy itself (though of course we know that mimic Kane and real Lena both have part of the shimmer within them (mimic Kane obviously a much bigger part).

Who knows if this being even intended to come to Earth or not. It may have simply ended up here. But once it's here, it basically acts like a cancer collectively upon earth, and perhaps ""in remission"" at the end of the movie, but still there as we see.",7zqsdy

The amount would be the delta of the other known refractions. Basically, by chance, giving traits to organisms that may be similar to known traits in other organisms. I would liken it to binary and bit shifts, but being base 4 or quaternary.

dypiwav,"IMO, for something to be a genuine plothole, it has to pass 2 tests:

1) ""can this be explained by understanding the movie better?""

2) ""can this be explained by adding something plausible, so that it all makes sense?""

eg Q: why go the long & difficult way instead of by sea or along the coast?

1) Ventress said they tried that. Something goes wrong

2) The sphaghetti monster gets them.

I feel a lot of ur questions don't pass these 2 tests but they are good questions that can help with trying to work out what's happening in the movie

eg that something gets them lends weight to the theory: ""the entity wants them to go through the forest - it's directing them there so that it can make an Adam & Eve""

Q. How did Kane escape the zone unseen?

A. He returns to the house that the bear dines in (which is in the town called ""Ville Perdu"").
We know this because it's *exactly* the same externally & internally apart from 2 things:
1) it's been redecorated 2) the plants have overgrown.

However, because:
1) he returns when the lawn & plants outside are trim
2) an ambulance reaches him

it's probable he returned 2 years ago, before Ville Perdu was evacuated & engulfed.

Therefore ur question is:
""how did he escape the zone 2 years ago unseen, before the military base, Fort Amaya, was swallowed & before Area X was near to the shimmer?""

Now it doesn't seem so implausible that he might escape because maybe security wasn't so tight back then.

Furthermore, he says he wasn't outside the house but he was outside the bedroom. This suggests he teleported which suggests he's mutated into a nightcrawler (like in X-men). Therefore bypassing security might be no problem to him.",7zqsdy

As to the rest,  they may have explained some of the things that happened but I don’t think it was as direct as you make it out to be. Yeah it was aliens but it was never as simple as that. Just like the characters, there’s no understanding of why they were there or if they wanted anything at all. It adds to the ambiguity of “Did this land here by accident? Was this a purposeful invasion? Where could this have originated from?” I get what you’re saying though. Things could’ve been fleshed out a little bit more but I’d be willing to bet Garland did what he could with the length and if there was a bigger budget then maybe they could’ve made it longer.

Another aspect of the book that I absolutely loved was the internal metamorphosis of the Biologist and her perspective shift of Area X, but I understand how that couldn't really be properly communicated in the medium.

You can certainly think of life as information, but your internet metaphor makes me think that that's not the road you're going down.

Life, at its very most basic, is simply change. Annihilation, destruction, death -- all are defined by the small scope of their objects. Zoom out, and death becomes part of a greater life. Total annihilation is but the reverse perspective of total integration, once one realizes that nothing exists in isolation from the substance and context from whence it came. The Shimmer is accelerated and condensed life force, rapidly changing all that it encapsulates through growth, synthesis, and integration to no end but that.

This is why the movie's ending is great.

dzhg1rb,"> and at the end there is no clear explaination for a lot of thing that happened.

I don't think there needs to be a clear explanation, but I wish something more telegraphed, or at least something aligned with the rest of the movie.

The way the characters ended started to annoy me when flower girl supposedly turned into a tree in extremely speedy fashion, and when the doctor just sort of slowly exploded. 

It's as if there was some grounded sci-fi in there, what with mutations happening so rapidly that it seemed like an accelerated, and totally alternate branch of evolution. The bear seemingly evolving a baiting tactic over the course of a day or two etc. But then there was the girl that walked off and became a tree... I had some pause there realizing the sci-fi route the movie was on was about to take a turn. I guess I'm kind of reminded of Lucy, wherein the sci-fi aspects hopscotched the shark after a decent opening. 

I suppose a lot of it is left intentionally vague. Kane mentions his skin being like liquid in the camcorder video, they cut the guy's stomach open to reveal a similar look inside in the other video, and the chamber where the being manifests also has that liquid DMT trip going on. Then, the girl who sees her fingerprints moving like that. Seems like it's a hallucination sometimes, but it's also the way the world around them looks, and that guys intestines are literally moving- not a hallucination. Not consistent, but intentionally so?

Then, there's the thing with Kane and how he has a thick accent, but doesn't seem to in any other scene. Intentional? The, ""is alive Kane the original Kane,"" question seems like one you can't even ask until we've tried to understand the weird accent that is present at no other time. Or was it, and I'm just not remembering?

The lighthouse scene, with the camcorder portion and the doctor turning into the thing that turns into Portman thing was easy to follow (except for the doctor being the catalyst), but seemingly doesn't matter because the shimmer in Kane and Lena's eyes in the end, and their dialogue, suggest that the outcome with the being doesn't matter. That, and Lena's blood test where she reveals that it's ""in me,"" etc... it's inconsequential. She was destined/doomed to her fate seemingly the second she entered the shimmer. ",7zqsdy

It's possible Copy Kane took other parts of him, and left him with his desire to self-destruct, with the Shimmer taking him just as the others were taken, but the Copy left with wanting to be with Lena, to create something new. Lena, who went in to do the same, because she ""owes him"", didn't let go of that, and instead let go of her desire to destroy her life, which the potential Copy Lena took and instead self-immolated.

Also, that theme write large throughout the film, reminded me of a paper that was published a year before the first book came out, and wonder if the author of either the book or film adaptation had read about it.

Jeremy England's 2013 paper 'Statistical physics of self-replication' hypotheses that that life is a self organizing expression and efficient mechanism of Entropy. 

The intrinsic breaking down and distribution of energy via the life process. That life exists because the law of increasing entropy drives matter to acquire life-like physical properties in order to get from A to B.

Unlikely. The clones don't seem to exhibit much understanding of human devices. Kane in the video mentioned that it was a phosphorous grenade. I doubt the clone would be able to grasp that after being literally created. Also if the clones did innately understand human tech, then Lena's clone wouldn't just stand there and hold the grenade willingly. They are indeed genetic copies of people, but their minds are much more... infantile and alien if that makes sense. 

> Why were the bones outside the lighthouse laid out in the pattern that they were? Who or what laid them out in that way?

No one really knows. It's just something Garland put into the film to make people think. There's 4 skulls meaning at least four people died but who could have killed them? Did they kill themselves? There's no sign of anyone else having even *reached* the lighthouse prior to Lena except Kane. And the skulls/bones I guess. 

> What happens to Ventriss after she’s dissolved in the Mandelbulb? Does she still exist in any form? Did she consciously choose to dissolve into the orb or was it inevitable?

She seeked a connection with it, and gave herself in willingly. It seems like characters that chose that path have the process accelerated much quicker e.g. Josie. 

>When Lena passes out, the copy stands still and stares at the light. It seems like her conscious mind is what attracts or affects the copy - it stops standing and lies down next to her just before she wakes up, mimicking her as she awakens. Why does it stare at the light instead of laying down like her, and then choose to mimic her again when she wakes up?

This one is interesting to think about. I was wondering that too... it mimic'd her but not entirely. Also, why couldn't it just take Lena's DNA forcefully? She was pressed up entirely on her near the door. Why did it have to wait for Lena to touch it before it could turn into her clone? Does this lifeform require consent? That would be odd... since it doesn't ask for anyone's consent before altering their genetic code and shows no sign of ethical thought throughout the entire film.

The bear had appeared to not attack them as they were tied up because they were remaining calm. Josie, who was showing the most fear at this point, was the one the bear attacked first.

Earlier in the story Sheppard had showed very little emotion during all of their horrific encounters. Sheppard said that she was just as scared as Josie was and that she was ""just hiding it better.""

During Sheppard's death she was forced to express her fear as she screamed for help while she was being dragged away by the 'Screambear'. It was possibly after this attack that the 'Screambear' developed a taste for fear. The screams from this attack were harnessed by the 'Screambear' and later utilized to try and draw fear from the 3 tied to the chairs.] (#spoiler)",7zqsdy

Fucking terrifying shit yo.",7zqsdy
durp8p7,"I think it is much simpler than the other comments.

1) The bear doesn’t decide what gets refracted. The fact that it screams is totally out of its control, just like the tattoo moving to other people’s arms and the soldier’s moving insides. The Shimmer put that in the bear.

2) Animals usually attack necks. Nothing more to it. Kills the prey quicker.

There are articles out there about why Paramount went with the Netflix distribution overseas...apparently they were afraid of the film being too intellectual and thereby turning off audiences.

But how much of that stuff is really all alien? It was all just changed by the shimmer. Like some stuff came straight out of that blackhole looking thing, but I assume most of it did not...

The crystal trees do, but I think they show the place at the shimmer's edge and that wasn't burnt up was it? hmm

Ventress is already dead and this is the clone in the process of completing her transformation.

There are only 4 nucleic acids that make up all life, adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine. But it doesn't know what goes where since the genome can be assembled any way and still fit together. And after it collects the data, or genes, it starts merging them, trying to get an understanding of what life is. The alien probably settles in a human form because we are top of the food chain. So it gets one alien outside. Then with Lena, she's able to destroy it because it has no idea wtf is going on. By the time Lena gets out, her alien husband has enough time to recover and understand its new world, but is still able to transmit data through touch, like when Lena touched it and it was able to copy her face (although, without getting too nerdy, it was able to do that anyways bc it's programmed in her blood).

Lena wanted to get out so she wasn't turned into a plant or anything, but the girl who did seemed to want that, so it accelerated the process.

I also noticed that the trees on the beach were made of a mineral or glass or something, and minerals don't have cells, so it can't be a DNA mutation, it's straight up molecular. It seems like the Shimmer scrambles *everything*, be it ideas, DNA, molecular structure, accents, you name it. That's how Lena's memory of her home even caused a house to mutates into the shape of her own.",7zqsdy
dv682cz,"For the accent, what I gathered as a possible explanation was that the real Kane had an accent, and the actual Kane told by ""Lena""'s narration is not the real Kane, but the duplicate. This would also go for Lena, as stated throughout the story she was a liar. Who is to say that she was also an unreliable narrator? In the end, I figured they were both the duplicates based off of the shimmer in their eyes.",7zqsdy
dv64587,"I noted those two things as well.
I'm still pondering about the house. Since a whole physical object being created out of someone's memory seems out there.
I want to watch it again and look for similarities between the living rooms. (from one flashback and when they are tied up)

As for his accent. Now that you mentioned it being possibly from another man on his crew. I guess it would be a lot like how the bear could make A sound like Shepard. It's more about how everything is blended rather than just being a biological trait. ",7zqsdy
dv5qjri,So totally both of these things. Both unexplained. ,7zqsdy
dv8du21,"Think about awareness and perspective. Do you think you stepped on a bug on your way to work today?

Do you think the bird that shits on your car knows why you don't like that?

The mimic, the alien, is not from our reality, it doesn't exist within the contexts we have gathered and carried around with our 5 ways of being aware of the world around us. 

It is totally alien. Understanding it's motivation would be like trying to explain to your dog why it can chew on a stick, but not inside the house. 

Which is to say, if we encountered aliens, ""Take us to your leader"" would probably not be the context that ensues. It would most likely be an absolutely unfamiliar [and that's the important part, real unfamiliarity, totally foreign, unknowable] situation. 

The alien wasn't motivated to enslave humanity or procreate with our women or anything like that. It very well may have just been acting the same way a germ does when it gets you sick, it's just doing what it is capable of doing and it isn't motivated any further than simply operating it's mechanical functions. ",7zqsdy
dv8f58t,[deleted],7zqsdy
dv8k90f,"My takeaway is that the alien didn't need to have a clear motivation. There was no definitive objective of ""take over planet Earth"" or ""exterminate humans"". it just existed because it can and it will, until it ends up being destroyed either by itself and or an outside force, just like life here on earth.

The idea that all life (even alien) ultimately squashes itself out seems to be a pretty common theme for a movie titled *Annihilation*. Life, in any form, has no meaning. It is just pure luck that at some point in time, a bunch of non-living things formed a pocket of nutrients that was able to recreate itself and suddenly it was a living thing. From there, natural selection shaped those life-pockets into the complex life forms we know today. None of this was conscious. Things that did a better job at existing existed, and things that were not good at existing stopped existing.

Of course, life comes with death. If natural selection always selects for the organisms best equipped to survive in their current surroundings, why do all organisms eventually die? It's a side effect of existence that life forms must eventually stop existing. They die at their own hands or they are forcibly killed by something else. 

TL;DR **In other words, life creates itself and it destroys itself for no reason whatsoever.** ",7zqsdy
dv97fz5,"I saw the aliens & the Shimmer Zone as a **metaphor for cancer** & tumors: 
malignant & aimless...just like cancer.

My biggest issue with the film is the **choppiness of the plot line** & overall lack of a concrete payoff.

*Example*: [Did Lena's eyes shimmer because she's recovering from DNA refraction... or is she the alien clone and did she destroy the lighthouse as a ruse..?](#spoiler)",7zqsdy
dvah53k,"Excellent points and I agree wholeheartedly. The movie exists right on the edge of stellar sci-fi and made-for-tv schlock and leans way too often into the latter section.

You've mirrored a sentiment I've had as well, about the hopelessness of the ending. My take is that the presence in Area-X existed until two viable candidates from the planet it's on made their way far enough into the core to be replicated and then sent out of the zone it had quarantined itself in. It couldn't exist outside the ""shimmer"" (Kane was dying after leaving) so once it had Kane out and Lena was effectively corrupted by it's own DNA it no longer needed area-x and was free to burn it down and spread properly on Earth. That's the only explanation I can come up with that isn't ""Portman saves the day and blows up the bad alien but uh-oh she's one too now"". These aren't conclusions that I feel confident making because there are so many other potential outcomes due to the poor storytelling.

Ex-Machina had Ava fulfill all the requirements of what it means to be fully, yet artificially, intelligent. She takes advantage of Caleb and her Creator perfectly, for her own self-preservation. She escapes, showing a beautiful quick shot of remorse and she abandons Caleb to die knowing he is a weakness to her continued existence. She is free to roam humanity, either for our betterment or our detriment. 

Lena, confined to a government facility, finds her husband and implies that she knows he's not really himself anymore since neither is she. They both admit this, embrace, and their eyes glow pink. While they are in a room full of government officials and video/audio equipment. As if they wouldn't immediately be dissected and destroyed, since the cellular change is so evident that even Lena could see it on a portable micro-scope. Their escape from, and experience in, Area-X means nothing. Not thought-provoking. Ultimately pointless.",7zqsdy
dv8dk5g,"Part of what makes this alien unique is that it likely has no real purpose. Purpose and motive is something largely unique to complex earth life, but that might not be the case where ever that thing came from. I like to think that it crashed on earth and started alerting things, not because it was trying to create something but because changing things is just what it does. The copies of the people only had a purpose when they were given one, kane's copy just copied him until he told it to find her, and her copy must have just been instructed to burn, because it did a great job of that shit. Its just a weird prism creature mucking up the place. ",7zqsdy
dvb1t19,"I don't think there really needs to be a motivation for the alien presence. That's just how the evolution of cells works. They are mutating and merging with whatever it comes across and changes it. And I don't think it's just two alien-human clone things that we end on. She set the fire which cause it's own form of annihilation on everything that the shimmer had spread to, but Kane was already out so he was spared. Once he hugs her at the end, he starts to merge and refract with her, just the way the Shimmer does. Now she's got it in her and will start the change. Both of them will continue to merge and refract with what they come in contact with and the Shimmer will spread.

dvzd3rb,I just watched it and I thought the thing was Lena's double took her place and is telling Benedict Wong's character the story it needs to tell to not be killed by humans - it learned this after cloning Lena.  So Lena and Kane can continue the alien evolutionary invasion of Earth.  The clues were in the water glass and the eye reflection at the end in both characters' eyes.  Just my interpretation.,7zqsdy
dw18o5w,"> So why didn’t Kane and Lena burn too?

Kane is already dead. Kane's clone should have in theory also burned. (imo a huge plot hole) Lena is not tethered to the Shimmer. There would be no reason for her to burn. 

> Why did Lena’s double suddenly become passive after she gave it the grenade and not continue mirroring her?

I think the clones aren't entirely ""human"". They are genetic copies of the original, but they don't really retain their memories or life experiences or *soul*. They don't have normal emotional reflexes e.g. Kane's clone doesn't really react when Lena hugs and kisses him. They don't really seem to grasp everything that it means to be human. And they certainly don't understand innately what human objects do i.e. this is just a thing she gave me and put in my hand. 

> Why was Kane’s double dying at first but then suddenly got well after the shimmer was destroyed? You’d think the opposite would have happened.

**HUGE plot hole.** There's no explanation for how/why Kane's clone lives. This is my biggest gripe with this movie. They used the Kane clone's health as the mcguffin: it serves to push Lena into the Shimmer, and then at the end when its convenient, he magically recovers his health so he and Lena can ""live on as something new"". ",7zqsdy
dw0ftnz,"As far as the scene in the Lighthouse, and Lena being able to escape, here's my read: Lena died up against the door--her shimmer-mimic smothered her to death by pressing her hard up against the door.  When the grenade goes off, the clone seems to stop and consider Kane for a long while, even touching his head, before moving on to burn the place down.  I interpreted that as the entity having absorbed Lena's consciousness--in sort of the same way that the bear was able to mimic Shepard's dying screams--and was acting up on her impulses at that time.  

I dunno, I might be really far out on a limb, but after a few viewings, that's my take.",7zqsdy

It was constantly evolving and growing. They referred to it as scary, it was tough to navigate, it magnified their flaws, it was beautiful and terrifying all at the same time.

Lena talked about all life coming from a single cell in the opening classroom scene. And I think the entity she encounters in the end is just that. The first cell to start life on the planet, only the planet already has life here. So, to say it doesn't want anything, would seem accurate to life. Life just is. It exists to exist. It was naive, and had no intention.

If you got scared or lost your way the shimmer would destroy you. If you lost your will you were absorbed by it. Only Lena with her will to be for Kane was allowed to evolve into the next step in the evolutionary process. Her and Kane at the end were living hybrids of this alien cell and earthly biology. A form of natural selection. There was love there but the embrace, I think, was more a recognition by both of what they had become. Opposites but the same.",7zqsdy

[spoiler] 

In the book Natalie Portman's character 'The Biologist"", goes to investigate the tunnel earlier with a couple others (It's also not in or near the light house).

dwdcmdw,"> all the human things that caused people to go into the void (cheating, cancer, regret,) are broken down into nothing. Am i possibly missing a connection here into diving into ones self? thats all i got aha

Not to mention Anya's issues with sobriety. so they each represent human self-annihilation in some way:

Lina: cheating (moral faults)

Ventress: aging/cancer (genetic faults)

Josie: cutting, (weakness, self-harm)

Anya: addiction/rage (lack of control)

Shepard: child loss, regret. (accidental)

Shepard's death being random, abrupt and no fault of her own I think mirrors accidental tragedy in life. All the other characters in some way are responsible for their own fates.

Josie's death is ambiguous in that it's either seen as a suicide or her taking control and choosing the shimmer; which seems to reflect the earlier conversation over whether Josie self-harmed in order to die or in order to feel alive.

I think Ventress's greatest struggle being her diagnosis of cancer at an old age suggests a hubris to her character. She doesn't carry the faults or pain of the other characters; instead I think her character reflects a desire for immortality and something beyond the human condition where age and deterioration don't happen. She ends up as Henrietta Lacks who was quite literally broken down to her basic components, cells, but nonetheless is immortal.

I definitely think a big theme is ""when you look into the shimmer, the shimmer looks into you"" kinda deal.",7zqsdy
dwcuipk,"I did get those vibes too. The movies is quite deep and intellectual. It showed an alien life form that we've never seen before, and even those shapes, that entity that appears near the end (when the clone is forming) they're not random, they're all based on the representation of mathematical formulae or astronomical stuff. It's really smart and the idea is that everything is broken down to DNA and that DNA is remixed resulting in beautiful or scary creatures.

The alien force itself is neither evil nor destructive. It just exists and it changed things to something different, like we change things around us, like nature changes us, like our relationships, diseases, goals, emotions, actions and society and the world around us change us. They moved to another type of world and that world changed them, but it only felt so drastic because it's unlike anything we've seen before. So I feel like the movie reflects on life, and the effect of life on people, the effects of time, they can't even realize how long they've been there. When life affects or changes us, sometimes we forget when we started changing or how. It just happens and we suddenly start realizing it.

All imagery of water when important change is happening in the characters, or they're talking about the changes they've experienced.

This would've helped them with the 3-4 day hole in their memory upon their entry to the shimmer. They don't take any night vision goggles with them as well. Why? It's not like they don't have access to gear like that, and they're going in for several days, anyone with ""seven years in the military"" would get all her squad to take night vision with them, but instead they just take a single pair of NV binocs, resulting in them not being able to gun down that bear and losing their first member.

It’s not even clear that that clone understands how to lie, and it also has no apparent agenda.

It also explains why vehicles couldn't be taken in as sometimes they had to crawl through the entrance to get in.

> How did they know her husband was in an ambulance and then immediately try to ram it off the road rather than order it to stop or contact the paramedics directly, such an odd scene.

Lena was already under surveillance. Her husband was part of a covert military operation and was considered missing or KIA. At the beginning of the film, Kane returns home and is visibly ill. Lena calls the paramedics explaining that her husband Kane is ill. Of course her phone was being wire tapped by the government and the location of the ambulance on call was tracked by them leading to the scene in the film. They rammed it because they needed to contain the situation fast as Kane was a HVT (High Value Target). If they contacted the paramedics directly, it would raise suspicion. 

""Hi, we need to take the patient that you are transporting to the hospital.""

If you look closely, the camera screen shows that the battery is very nearly dead; it's in the red, with only a little bit left.

Time is less certain. Depending on whether you choose to believe the Lena-who-is-interrogated, there may be a time dilation effect within the Shimmer. She claims she was only gone for ""maybe a few weeks"", but Wong informs her that she was gone for four months. If that's right then time moves more slowly within the Shimmer, so the battery is less likely to be totally dead.

Still a bit ""convenient"", though.

> The framing device of her talking to the guy in the hazmat suit with flashbacks was unnecessary for me, and I think it actually takes away from the mystery. The entire film we already know that she got out (even if it isn't exactly her).

Yeah, but... the whole point is that you're not sure if it is her. Maybe you've been watching a mimic in all those flashforwards. Maybe it's Lena but she's been changed. Maybe it's Lena but she's lying. (She lies to the reader in the book.) Multiple interpretations there.

> She starts freaking out immediately and wants to turn back and leave the shimmer after one of them dies. Why?

Because she's learned that Lena isn't there on the same mission as the rest of them. They're all happy with a suicide mission because they have nothing to lose, but they don't want to *die* per se. It's more like ""Yeah, if we die on this mission that's fine, but I'd rather not if it works out that way.""

Once it's learned that Lena's actually in there because her husband is the guy who came back, things change. Can they trust her? Clearly she's going to be more motivated to get an ""answer"" out of the Shimmer than the rest of them, because she still has something to live for, so she's more likely to suggest more dangerous tactics and whatnot.

Not to mention, tough-girl is kind of losing it already. She's seen her skin move, and she's not totally sure if it's actually moving or if it's an illusion and all in her head. She's just losing it in general, so this one hard piece of doubt (Lena's motive) breaks everything for her and she doesn't know what to do, but she knows she sure as hell doesn't want to be in this place anymore.

What you said makes sence, that she was sleeping with he co-worker prior to Kane's disappearance.  This explains why Kane left, despite the initial outward appearance that they had a perfect marriage. The movie's timeline was a little tricky to follow, no doubt purposely done, to change initial emotions you felt towards characters.

It's good that it's not made a big point of, but I'd like at least a little more reasoning behind it if you're going to mention it in the movie.

dur8jw2,"My friend and I kind of developed our own thoughts on the tattoo and the meaning of Area X altogether. Area X/The Shimmer feels almost dreamlike/heavenlike in the same way the Garden of Eden probably felt in the book of genesis(albeit not as brutal).

In the first rendition of Eden, Eve is the one who is punished for her curiosity and because of this mistake humanity is not only banished from Eden, but made mortal. Remember when Lena has that pillow-talk with her husband about how humanity's  DNA is flawed, and that's why we age/self-destruct? It is because of women God decides to make us the way we are, and the snake tattoos are the mark of the snake that fooled Eve into eating the apple.

The similarities continue into this reappearing of Eden. Once again the males of humanity are powerless to enact change, the necessary change in this case being the ability to dissipate this new, destructive Eden. However, for the women, it's a tale of redemption. Ultimately Lena is Eve and once again she gets humanity banished from The Garden of Eden, this time for the sake of humanity.",7zqsdy

No robot probes, no drones, no one even bothered to spool cables for power or communication into the shimmer. Bit of a plot hole that the only way this organization can think to probe the shimmer is to keep sending in unstable people on foot.

Edit to add: comments below indicate the book answered these questions. A little exposition on why they had to enter Area X in the manner they did might have been nice but it doesn't detract from the movie in any huge way.",7zqsdy
duz9mje,"I really wish the film had done a better job of addressing this, since it was explained pretty thoroughly in the books. I'm guessing that it was left out in order to keep the runtime down. 

&nbsp;
>Airdrop people from a plane into the shimmer near the lighthouse? Helicopter with a ladder so they can grab samples and get out? Send in a boat since it's RIGHT ON THE SHORE?

The film doesn't state it explicitly (although I suppose it's implied by the Southern Reach base's location), but the only way into Area X is through a small entrance roughly twenty feet high and twelve feet wide. If a person or aircraft or ship touches the border/shimmer somewhere other than the at entry point, he/she/it will get sucked in/vanish/be obliterated. And it doesn't allow for half measures, either: once you touch it, you're pulled into the void.

&nbsp;
>Send in vehicles, tanks, construction equipment or something to pave a safe path or road forward or make expeditions around the perimeter that go in small distances at a time and then slowly move more forward if it's safe . Or at least send I people with shovels and axes or something so they can pave somewhat of a safe path themselves for future expeditions on the way back.

This wouldn't work either. The entrance crossing through into Area X is far more treacherous than it appears from the outside. It takes expeditions anywhere from 3-10 hours on average and it becomes extremely narrow at certain points, forcing the expedition members to crawl on their bellies. This makes it impossible for the expeditions to get any sort of vehicles though. 

It's also an extremely terrifying/traumatic undertaking, which is why the expedition members need to be hypnotized beforehand. The film gives a nod toward this when the characters suddenly ""wake up"" in Area X with no recollection of anything beyond approaching the border.

&nbsp;
>No expeditions in marked any waypoints or left a trail to follow back?

Time moves faster in Area X and the vegetation grows at an accelerated rate, making it difficult to maintain trails or markers. And this assumes that the expedition members can even find their way out, as once inside Area X there is no longer a visible border/shimmer. In the book the biologist/Lena comes across a written journal from a previous expedition that had traveled up the coastline in an unsuccessful attempt to reach the border from inside Area X:

>>Instead, the same habitat confronted them day after day. “We’re heading north, I believe,” he wrote, “but even though we cover a good fifteen to twenty miles by nightfall, nothing has changed. It is all the same,” although he also was quite emphatic that he did not mean they were somehow “caught in a strange recurring loop.” Yet he knew that “by all rights, we should have encountered the border by now.”

>>The return trip to the lighthouse took four days, not seven, “as if the land had contracted.”


",7zqsdy
duy4oth,"If I were looking at the shimmer from a safety standpoint, I'm astounded by the lack of training and equipment they provided with the team going in. The government must have understood that there was some kind of electromagnetic waves or radiation or alien threat inside the shimmer. I feel like if this was a real scenario the team would at least have been suited up as well as a team entering Chernobyl for instance. I'm talking full hazmat suits at the very least!

Looking at your point 3 I'm totally with you. If it were me going in, I'd have a note pad and like a million pens to take notes like every step I took, especially after blacking out for 3 days. Any one who works in a lab (Lena worked at Johns Hopkins as a biology professor) should know how important note taking is and I can't imagine a more important experiment she undertook.

Lastly, I feel like the plan they had going into the shimmer should have been nailed down to a T. As in, ""hey as soon as we can get any sort of biological data lets gtfo!"" Let's figure out what the fuck is going on before we just recklessly plunge into some unknown hazardous environment with no exit plan.

dv4prke,I assumed this had something to do with the refractory nature of the shimmer. Kane's thoughts and desires were to return home to his wife without any memory of her infidelity.

>If you've ever suffered personal pain so intense that you've entered a period of self-destruction, you've entered the shimmer.

>Time gets distorted. If you've been in a dark place of depression or self-destruction, it's easy to lose days, weeks, or months.

>Communication to the outside world is cut off. If you've been in a hole, you know it's tough for others to reach you and you to reach out.

>Reality gets distorted. Events of the past and who you are get reflected in a way that is a mutation of reality. This could lead to seeing things horrifically but also can lead to seeing creative, beautiful things too - as Lena noted. (And why many artists have periods of self-destruction.)

>There's a chance monsters (aka ""personal demons"") will tear you apart.

>Some who enter the shimmer don't want answers and they don't want out. The fight is gone. They just want to fade out and disappear, like the physicist who gently becomes part of the landscape. This is a moving portrayal of depression and would guess this part hits some people very, very hard.

>For those in the shimmer fighting to find the truth - or ""the light"" - many will die before they get there. (The soldier's bones outside the lighthouse)

>Kane does reach the lighthouse but he can't defeat the alien. Sometimes in life one reaches a situation so painful that one does not have the ability to handle it - something like a mental breakdown. At that point in life, who somebody is - their identity - incapable of handling the present situation has no choice but to blow themselves up. The Kane that survives the shimmer is a clone, he's not the Kane that went in. This could be seen as a metaphor for those who when entering a period of self-destruction get hammered and destroyed. They make it out, but the person who makes it out is not the same person who entered.

>Lena reaches the lighthouse and the alien, her enemy, the one that blocks the door from her escaping, the one that mirrors and mimics her, she sees as herself.

>This is perhaps an inspirational message to those dealing with self-destructive issues. It's you who is blocking you and the only way you make it out of the shimmer is to blow that shit up.

>Once she does that, the shimmer vanishes and Kane recovers. This may be a metaphor for somebody who successfully is able to defeat their self-destructive tendencies. Things return to normal and those around them heal, even if nobody is quite the same as before they entered.

>And for the shimmer appearing in their eyes. If you have been through a period of self-destruction, you can often see it in the eyes of others who have been there too.

Wasn't there also that part where the clone straight up hits her and knocks her unconscious? I saw the movie roughly a week ago, so I'm kind of rusty, but the gist I got was that it mimicked her a lot, but it did so at its own will. It did its own thing when it wanted to.

1) The organism absorbed Lena's impulse to self-destruct and allowed itself to be destroyed. Evidence of this is that the organism gets exhausted falls at the same time as Lena.  The clone also burns Kane's corpse, implying some kind of feeling. The organism was an incomplete clone and reacted pretty much the same way Lena would in those moments they acted different. Like Lena wasn't cloned, but separated into two like a cell dividing. One side light and one side dark. 

2) The organism tried to annihilate the fire and instead burned itself to ash

And my personal favorite
3) The organism was still reacting to Lena's behavior. When you look at the refraction of figers through water it's not always a perfect reflection. I believe the organism refracts the laws of reality the same way water refracts light. Sometimes  the organism mimics, sometimes it does the inverse.

Fucking thank you. yes. I said exactly this in another comment. Also, especially when Kane was in multiple organ failure after entering then leaving the shimmer - Why no hazmat suits on Portman's group? Why no respirators or anything? Nothing to protect them from the environment. 

> Why did a biologist claim that species can't cross-breed? Has she never heard of mules?

Mules are typically sterile, they are the exception to the rule, and they are the product of two animals that are VERY VERY similar genetically. A shark and an alligator would not be capable of cross-breeding, which is what she was specifically talking about. True cross-breeding requires successful reproduction. Truly successful reproduction is not just producing living offspring, it's producing offspring that can also reproduce. So, back to my first sentence, mules are usually sterile. You can't produce a viable ""species"" of mule, you only get one.

Don't take this as a personal attack on you, but I have a feeling a few people read the book or maybe saw/read a review and posted that theme out of nowhere here.  Now, it seems everyone is regurgitating that theme without even questioning if it exists in the movie.  

> no one attempts to leave after collecting a bit of data. But I'm not sure if this has been picked up on before, but Ventress, imo, specifically chose people who were prone to suicide or extreme guilt/sadness

Again, this has been regurgitated here without anyone questioning if this is in fact true.  Wasn't it blatantly clear that at least half the team were not suicidal when they wanted to ""get the fuck out of here!""  They even voted on it, and was pissed as hell when Portman's character didn't support their decision to leave.   This idea that all of them had a death wish did not come from the movie.

I'm looking at this from a tiny, slightly different perspective. In that I believe Lena and Kane have been changed. Kane is a clone, Lena is a mutant. But they are evolved.

I guess I don't see the alien trying to spread. I see the alien trying to help humans evolve. And it challenges all of those who enter to shed their lower aspects. To face their shadows. Most don't. So it keeps spreading to find those who will. Finally, a man and a woman are able to do it. Kane sacrifices himself but allows his double to go out and find Lena (whereas it appears many others died, along with their clones, outside the lighthouse where the sets of bones lie). 
Lena faces her shadow self and kills it with the full explosive power of phosphorescent light (her conscious awareness).

I even made a comment here about it a couple days ago. 

I have read the book since then, and it sort of changes how I see it. Actually, it kind of makes it even more bothersome that it wasn't revisited? Because in the book there is the hypnosis thread, which is integral to the story. As far as the movie goes, I think probably everyone is right that we should just assume it happened more since she was in there so long, they just don't address it directly again. In a way it sort of seems like it was just a remnant of the hypnosis story line that the director remembered and included because it was big in the book but then opted out of including the rest of it.

One of the few things we learn about her is ~~her history of addiction, and~~ that she'd self-harm in order to feel something. I guess the effect of Area X on her body gave her that feeling or sensation she'd been seeking previously, so she just leaned into that feeling and surrendered to it. I don't think it was ""giving up"" in the defeatist sense, and more just accepting the process and ""letting go"" of what kept her human. She seemed to have found peace with it.

Edit: watched it again, think Anya had a history of addiction, not Josie. To add to the above though, Josie mentions not wanting to die like Shepherd did - scared and in pain.

Plot armor

>The bear used Shepard's scream to lure them out, but as they asked did her mind become part of the bear? Is she reliving that moment of her life over and over? Or did it just take her voice?

I doubt the bear 'used' her voice as in using intelligence to lure and trap people, as cool and horrifying as it would be. Being in the shimmer or the environment allowed DNA to cross with each other freely and on some level the implication is that while the bear was eating the person it, in some way, fused with her or bits of her fused to the bear. Ultimately the bear is some hybrid of bear and human and I want to say that its head was the way it was because it was transitioning into that hybrid shape

>Why did Josie give up? Was she brainwashed by the shimmer or had she just seen enough of losing those around her?

She reached the end and understands, somehow, that what is causing the shimmer is an alien life form that deconstructs life

> So, at what point was Lena no longer herself? Was it when she was hypnotised, when she was KO'D? We saw that the entity can play mind games, warp itself, can be capable of violence as well as changing the environment

You could say that she stopped becoming herself when she stepped in or maybe when she touched Kane. The movie shows the sometimes gradual and sometimes sudden mutation of one thing into another.

Annihilation by and large is a film that explores humanity's self-destruction. Everyone shares some tragedy or internal crisis that propels us toward our own annihilation. We struggle to feel worthy of existence itself and that is so strong, it is passed onto a life-form capable of manifesting it with literal and objective corporeality. At the end of the film we see the alien mimicking Lena trying to become a human not just by appearance or actions but also our way of thinking.

In the very end, bullets cannot challenge the adapting creature's existence because it is mimicking humanity. It only falls after it takes it's own life and it's own submissive existence is forced to expunge itself unto Lena. It tries aggressively and cannot succeed. It only succeeds when it gives into it's own destruction and ""perfectly adapts"", so to speak.

It leads to the alien coming closer to the realization that self-destruction is humanity's strongest internal (and perhaps repressed) drive so it takes several transfers, duplications, and even assimilation to finally reach this conclusion and it profoundly changes the alien and normalizes it into the human hierarchy. It has adapted to our instinctual low-humming of how we must expire with finality to inch forward to do it once more.

The alien effectively becomes a living, breathing, and physically existing manifestation of self-destruction.

dvrzzbk,"Okay here's a criticism of the dialogue with an example:

The interrogation scene. This scene is established pretty early on and we return to it numerous times throughout the movie. There is an older man in a Hazmat suit who interrogates Portman's character. There's a glass wall behind which a bunch of people in medical garb are standing and watching. Just from the visuals alone it's pretty obvious what the motivation for the lead interrogator and his cohorts is: They want to know what happened. This is very succinctly expressed through costume, set design, camera work and all the rest. Then half way through the movie we cut back there and the interrogator says ""I just want to know what drove you"". I think I actually groaned out loud when he said it.

It's just pointless exposition. In this film, a sort of sci-fi mystery, it just sucks all the mystery and natural tension out of the scenes. That's one example but this was repeated throughout the movie. It really just bogged the whole thing down for me. A shame because there was a lot to like about the film.

I thought they put so much emphasis on the answer of ""I don't know,"" early to set the stage for a purposely vague story about the nature of life.

duqm4fk,"> That is the point when I realized she was the alien and she lied about her escape.

I don't think it's that simple at all. The ""alien"" is not just an alien but also a mutation of herself. The movie used a lot of intentional imagery of cells splitting in two, hinting at this since the very beginning. What happened isn't just that whatever creature that was mimicked her, but it also *became* her, and she became it. The shimmer mutated her, and we still see the shimmer in her eyes afterward, not because she's the alien but because she's both herself and the alien.

It's easy to wipe away everything we saw and say ""well she was just an unreliable narrator"" but it's more complex than that. Her second alien half intentionally destroyed the lighthouse for example, and it reached for her husband's dead corpse. She - and her husband - both died and survived. They split in two, like cells.

The movie is a story about self-destructive behavior.

But I do agree the time loss angle could have been better explored and made for some interesting drama. I read why it happens in the book and for the film it seems like it was put in just to confuse us (on purpose).

The film heavily suggests that wasn't Lena being questioned at all but her double created in The Shimmer. The new infinity symbol tattoo on her arm that the soldier who got gutted and Anya had which wasn't there before she entered The Shimmer, and the glowing eyes (like the Kane double) that we see in the last shot is evidence of this. This means the Lena double was lying to the people questioning her. It puts everything we saw happen after Lena entered into The Shimmer into question. It could have all been lies, some lies, or just the last fight being a lie (maybe the alien did the grenade trick and not Lena). This is why a lot of people are thinking so much about the film even after leaving the theater.

For Kane's character, he is extremely important because the reason he goes to the shimmer knowingly on a suicide mission is that he's aware of Lena's affair. He still loves her, but is more dissapointed at himself that he isn't enough for her - tying back to the theme of self hatred/destruction.

Shephard tells Lena her daughter died of Leukemia, and that she had moved on - I think the direct quote was ""two people died the day my daughter died. Her, and also who I was"". I think it's clear that she hasn't moved on. When she gets taken by the bear, Ventress goes through her pack and takes her food. Josie finds a small toy bear attached to her backpack - probably the toy of her daughter, signifying she hasn't let go and this is why she dies - she is unable to move past the death of her daughter and change from it. Its also ironic that she gets killed by the bear.

For Anya Thorenson (Gina Rodriguez's character) - Shephard states that she was once a drug addict. Its why her application for the national guard got ""flagged"" and the southern reach came out to her. She is unable to accept the reality of the shimmer. It distorts everything and she blames it on the trick of the light. She isn't completely rehabilitated from her drug use, so her being inside the shimmer enhances the paranoia and its why she acts kinda crazy and distrustful.

Josie cut herself not to commit suicide, ""but to feel alive"". I really liked how Tessa Thompson portrayed her character, quiet, somber, and always seemingly in thought. The shimmer gave her the ability to feel alive by becoming a part of it.

Ventress was by far my least favorite character, mainly just because of the way her dialogue was delivered. But she truly wanted to know what was at the lighthouse, and she got her answers. She became enveloped in the entity/alien/clone - whatever you wanna call it. And she understood that this entity is here to to merge everything into one and envelop everything as a ""fragment"".

And not only does the ending *heavily* imply that she's not the real Lena, there's also the fact that Lena was the only one who was basically called directly to the shimmer. albeit somewhat indirectly, implying that the alien(s) had this plan from the start. Kane can't reproduce and continue the genetic line alone, something that the alien might not have known until someone (Kane #1) actually made it to the lighthouse. 

So how does the tattoo have anything to do with this? Well, I also remember it being on the arm of that mutated torso. Which was previously attached to the guy with eels in his intestines, or whatever the fuck was going on there. Maybe it was just a trait that the alien observed while it was messing around with the guy's DNA, and decided to copy it to the next clone it made. As for why the paramedic (I forget her name) also has it, honestly I don't really know. Might just be a mark that identifies people from the base, she did mention earlier in the movie that she was there for 10 months. ",7zqsdy
duu2twd,"The tattoo on the pool body is the same, but before that, in the boats, Lena mentions bruising where the tattoo, at the time, is beginning to develop.

dv87y5q,"Great analysis! 

I agree that the Kane that returns isn't necessarily missing memories. I agree he is most likely confused and aloof because of the extreme transformation he has gone through. He has killed a part of himself. 

I think there is too much emphasis being placed on the question of who is a clone and who isn't (on this forum). Because ultimately, Kane and Lena have changed. They have both killed a part of themselves. Potentially the self-destructive part of themselves. They are, potentially, evolved beings. The shimmer seems to force life to face the darkest aspects of its genetic programs, like for instance, self-destruction in humans. 

""You're not Kane, are you?"" 
""I don't think so."" 

I think this is the writer/director playing with us. He's still Kane. He isn't some alien or something. But he's certainly not the old Kane. He's gone through the hero's journey. He's faced darkness in himself. He is not Kane. He is an ascended human who has changed his biological makeup.

dvd8h8x,"From a story perspective it just addresses the fact that time is dilated in the shimmer. We already know that time inside seems to move faster than outside.

From a storytelling perspective it is an effective way to show the audience the effect the shimmer has on the mind. It makes the audience feel uneasy because it demonstrates that the shimmer doesn't operate within our own conceivable reality.",7zqsdy
dveaohk,"Why do you remember the dreams that you do, and not others? Not to suggest that ""it was all a dream."" I think this particular piece of artifice, the writer dipping in with this time lapse, signals to us that we should enter a different head-space, or perceptual framework to analyze what happens in the movie.

There's another implicit time lapse when the third act begins. [Right before this act transition, Josie walks off and we presume she turns into a plant. Then there's a bit of Lena's interrogation by Wong's character (if I'm remembering correctly), then Alex Garland marks the third act, ""The Lighthouse."" Lena appears and she's crying, then she stops and frowns, as if to say, ""what am I crying about?"" then looks around, and nearly thinks aloud, ""where am I?""](#spoiler)

The question for me is, why is Lena crying? At first we assume she's crying because of Josie's disappearance. But since there's was an implied time lapse, she could be crying about anything. We can't say how long it's been since Josie's disappearance. I think the correct order of cause and effect is that she's crying *because the third act has begun*. Then the question is, what does the third act *mean*? And why would this cause Lena to start crying?

Further, what has she been doing up until the third act starts? Avoiding the third act? Trying to find it? Killing time? It can't be arbitrary. Lena was in the shimmer for 4 months before her emergence. Remember, Kane spent a *year* in the shimmer. Why did it take him so long to make it to the third act? Or maybe it didn't, and where he got held up was in the third act, which resolved in his suicide. 

Final thing, and this one haunts me. How long was Ventress in the Lighthouse? Remember she split from Josie and Lena. Then there's a time lapse. How do all of these questions relate to her character?",7zqsdy

I like that Garland decided to focus more on adapting the tone of the story rather than the content of the story, *but* there were a number of things I wish had been adapted a little more faithfully, or just adapted in the first place. 

For example [I wish the tower/tunnel had been part of the story, as well as the use of hypnosis. I thought they were hinting at that towards the beginning when all the women except the psychologist are talking about how they can't remember what happened the night before, but the amount of food they have left suggests they've been in The Shimmer for four days. I also liked how in the book, most of the characters seemed to antagonize each other (or in particular how the biologist seemed to antagonize members of the group), and I was really looking forward to the confrontation between the biologist and the psychologist, and the revelation of what annihilation really meant](#spoiler).

I went into the movie knowing it wasn't going to be a faithful adaptation, and for the most part, I liked what I watched, but I'm definitely a little disappointed with some of the omissions/changes that were made.

* They seemed to have at least a little bit of control over how the shimmer affected them. 

* It seems that physicist just more or less gave up at that point and just didn't want to continue and let the effects take over. 

* The crazy lady just went kinda stir-crazy, while only the director and Lena had the willpower to keep going. 

* In the book, the director never actually makes it to the end location, but in the movie she does and it's not really explained what happens there.

* Lena makes it back out because she supposedly defeats what is in the Shimmer, though from the sounds of it, the Shimmer isn't gone by the end, her husband's double is still alive, and there's that color change in her eyes.

Basically, not a lot is explained and left up to interpretation, but IMO it's even more vague than the book is.",7zqsdy

dvoe3ka,"I think the alien life was having trouble adapting, whether to the environment outside the shimmer or perhaps to the reality of existing inside/alongside human beings.

Once that interaction happened, the Kane clone was able to survive.",7zqsdy
dvnyegb,"Going to go on a limb here, but maybe that was part of the plan? I think these beings had maybe the intention of sneaking into human society, and this was the way to do it: have somebody survive the encounters, send a copy, lure some humans into the shimmer using said copy, have some determined human actually outsmart these beings and destroy the lighthouse, and boom! We have an alien race living among us without even knowing it.

Pure speculation of course.",7zqsdy
dvob6no,"I've only seen it once so far, but this is the thing I keep dwelling on myself, everyone says (in every explanation I've read online) it's the copy/alien version of Kane that shows up; my first impression is it's one of the team members of Kane that managed to make it to the lighthouse with him. If Portman's character is an alien then this theory is shot to hell, but the fact that she had Anya's tattoo in the interrogation chamber, and Anya was talking about her fingerprints moving, I think it changed their outer appearance like it changed the pool guy's intestines and the scream in the bear and everything else - it just started merging and scrambling things without any real rhyme or reason, and that team member happened to make it back to Portman after he was told to do so. I still dont know what the deal is with the eye shimmer, but atm I think it's just the side effects of being subjected to the shimmer, their DNA is changing constantly.",7zqsdy
dvooad9,"I think that was her *and* what would have been her clone at the end, the lights burst from within her at the end and if you watch carefully when Natalie Portman's character first enters the cavern under the lighthouse you see that JJL's character's face is distorted and she doesn't appear to have eyes (similar to how Portman's clone looked at first).

Maybe you can see it as her being consumed by her obsession to know about what was happening there, a twist from her saying that she wanted to still be herself when they reached the lighthouse (she was and wasn't) - her last dialogue is talking about how she wanted to find what's in the lighthouse and ""I found it. It's inside me. Inside all of us."".",7zqsdy
dvooh2u,"My belief is that she had no penchant to come back into the world or live her life because she had no ""concessions""- no family or friends. She had 'self destruction' thing in her. Whereas Lena had the urge to come back or live for her husband. Assuming that the shimmer is a living thing (an alien or a probe to experiment the environment) it would make sense that whatever has no inclination towards life doesn't clone itself (or destroys itself) since it was heading in the self destruction path anyway. 

On the other hand, i think she did get cloned. As Lena enter that underground cavity we can see that Ventress's face has no features (just like the Lena's clone) but as Lena approaches her Ventress turns around and we then see that she has facial features. We don't know what happened to her original self or why she disintegrates into this evolving symmetrical object. ",7zqsdy

What matters is that Kane is a career soldier and Lena has an affair with her colleague while he's deployed. When he discovers the affair he volunteers for a mission he knows he won't come back from. Where ever any of these scenes fall on a timeline really doesn't change anything about the story. 

I choose to believe that by the first time we see Kane he already knows about the affair and may have already volunteered for the shimmer. Despite already knowing his wife cheated on him, he still loves her and to her credit Portman is pretty charming in that scene.  When he eventually leaves to go to the shimmer he doesn't put himself in a position for her to charm him again because then leaving would be that much more painful. But that's just my head canon.",7zqsdy

1. Playful scene
2. Kane leaves
3. Scene where Lena says that Kane knows about the affair

I think 3 happens very very soon after 2, and 2 happens make a week or so after 1. Kane has this weirdly reserved and distant attitude in 2 that suggests to Lena that he knows about the affair. I don't think Lena has told her lover in 3 that Kane had left yet.",7zqsdy
dvtx2gd,"I think they were far apart. I think it was just showing how happy they used to be.

dvxicev,"I think you might be grabbing too much for a real world explanation for a sci-fi movies physics. 

The shimmer took all light, radio-waves, dna, ect and refracted it everywhere. It wasnt a super fast process but parts of everything were refracting into everything causing crazy mutations like the beast with human dna specifically causing human voice. The elk/deer thing with plant dna. That one chick who kinda somehow randomly chose to turn into plants (idk how that one happened so fast). 

The idea is pretty cool but executed maybe slightly poorly by having some inconsistencies. Or maybe the inconsistencies is a beautiful execution of the idea in that everything is refracting so randomly that its just that, random execution.

So thats what the shimmer was doing but the shimmer and the alien being one in the same is debatable. I have no idea what the alien started as, whether was a specific individual alien to even begin with or if it was just a bi-product of the shimmer that started as a single cell or mutated from nature itself as u/thief180 said.

I also see this as a reference to The Deer Park where the Buddha first preached about Enlightenment.

""Why does Kane become sick outside of the Shimmer? ""

I think this was meant to draw Lena into the Shimmer. IMO the Consciousness of Area X learned of her by becoming Kane and lured her into it to create it's Adam and Eve.

A question I consider needs addressed is:

Why did the Shimmer allow itself to be destroyed?

My thoughts on this question are that it completed a mission by creating Kane and Lena- it was seeking a Sentient Life Form to alter. If not Sentient Life Form presented it would have spread over the planet it was on until its mutation properties CREATED a Sentient Species.

duqy787,"Would highly, highly recommend reading that blog post. If you loved this movie and it has set your mind racing, you're probably trying to figure out what it all meant. There are many excellent ideas in there which will you give more things to think about and a possible framework for examining the movie. It is really excellent work.

My own take was not nearly so cerebral. I've been trying to understand the movie as an allegory for self-destruction - a theme which the movie explicitly makes apparent. When Kane is no longer Kane to Lena, perhaps it is because he knows of the affair - as Lena suspected he did - and so the Kane that Lena laughed and loved with has been destroyed, by his own volition, and no longer exists. I've just started down this path though and have yet to work out how the symbolism could work. After reading the blog post, I like the ideas in there much, much better.

However, they both possess the crazy eyes. That leads you to believe that Lena was replaced by the humanoid... But wouldn't alien Kane know this? Or would this be an effect of her being in there too long?

Most of this film can be rationalized in our world with a suspension of disbelief in the physical sense, but that part stood out as off.

The only point I would like to make is not that Lovecraft's horror is not ""the fear that there are things which cannot be known is the ultimate fear,"" but that encountering that unknowablity would be so bigger than our tiny minds could handle that it would drive us insane. 

So in context, if at the climax of the film under the lighthouse, had Lena just collapsed and started foaming at the mouth or laying in a fetal position and laughing manically or whatever, would be the Lovecraft ending. 

The ending we got was 50% Hollywood not taking a risk and 50% not a bad idea given the theme of self-reliance and self-doubt and all the overall uselessness of self perception a.k.a literally fighting yourself and getting it to burn down the shrine to your fear and doubts.",7zqsdy

You could send an old, fly-by-wire plane, but I got the impression that the pilot would either wake up 4 days after entering, at some arbitrary location within the shimmer, half-starved and helpless, or else just crash immediately.

They could have potentially parachuted from outside going in, but not from the jungle side or the water side.  Conservatively estimating they were doing 5 miles through flat forest per day, and ignoring the lost time (so, very conservative), the radius around the light house must have been at least 20 miles, parachuting over water is out.  Parachuting onto the beach might get them an extra mile, but is risking unknown behavior on entry to shave off a pittance of travel.

It's said the observation group tried going to the lighthouse from every direction, presumably the coast was tried early on.  As for vehicles, it's not clear whether the shimmer corrupts hydrocarbons (fuel) or if its electrical properties might interfere with a spark-driven engine.  At no point inside the shimmer do the protagonists try to use a motor vehicle, generator, etc.  

It's *possible* there are dead four-wheelers scattered a few hundred feet inside the coastal entries, or that the beach coast terrain is instead more of a swamp at the coastal entry points, making vehicles useless.  Regardless, four-wheelers won't take you through dense forest, so given that entry point and a potential knowledge of motor failure, it makes sense they didn't opt for them.

That said, **I am absolutely making excuses for the movie, because it conveys almost none of this to the audience.**",7zqsdy

Also, I believe that the duplicate has Kane's memories and has somewhat of an idea of who Lena is and how much Kane loved her.  Kane killed himself (this is just interpretation) because he was having an existential crisis.

And then, the Shimmer pretended to be destroyed, for its own mysterious reasons, and sent clone Lena back (who lied about being the real Lena). Hence why they both have Shimmer Eyes.

I don't think Issac was an ""alien"". He was like a clone, like a single cell split into two. I think the implication was meant to be that one of the cells carriers all the self-destructive traits (there was a line of dialogue to that effect). Isaac was dying because the shimmer was actively fucking his DNA until it finally died. The Isaac that returns is identical, but different. Same with Portman's character.

Personally, I think the film reads like The Usual Suspects. Portman went crazy and killed her self and lit everything on fire and the Kaiser Souse Portman returns to share the harrowing tale, which she remembers because she's a copy of the OG Portman.",7zqsdy

Heres the whole movie in a nutshell.

Alien lands on earth and forms Area X
Area X the is the contained area for it's modular advancements but it is also primarily a TESTING GROUND for finding the appropriate Human Host! No one talks about this. It deems Oscar Issaic worthy so it creates a clone of him to lure his wife into area X. Portman goes into Area X as planned and reaches the lighthouse. The Alien finally having Potman begins the next stage of it's evolution which involves Annihilating it's own self! Since it now lives in both Osacr and Portman, the whole purpose of Area X is fulfilled and can go away now. Portman now infected with the simmer approaches her cloned husband with the idea of a second chance since this version of Oscar is not aware of the Affair in her mind. Both of them hug each other and their eyes reveal they both have the shimmer in them and will eventually reproduce bringing about the Aliens next evolutionary stage!

This whole movie is about the Aliens evolutionary process and how it does it. Everything that happens including Portmans escape was part of the plan the whole time!

[1. Technically it didn't ""want"" anything. In the books it's explained that an alien civilisation somewhere in the universe has bio-machines that are send to new planets to make it habitable for their hosts. Think kurzgesagts type 3 alien civilisation. Something bad happened along the way; either the original civilisation was wiped out or the bio-machine was knocked off its course... I don't exactly remember. Either way, it crashlanded on earth and simply started doing what it was meant to do: adjust its surroundings as ordered. It wasn't evil, it wasn't an attack, and like the biologist said, it wasn't actually destroying anything. It was changing. In the same sense we would be ""destroying"" mars by terraforming it. Now in the books it pretty much crashlanded on a person, and it kinda fused with him, so we can safely assume the whole process glitched the fuck out.

",7zqsdy

1. The alien did t want anything. In the book it’s more like a program/ terraforming device. It’s meant to fix things but because it’s alien it fixes it to their world. But because it’s on earth it doesn’t know how to fix it properly and makes something else entirely. A blend of both worlds but not correct either way.

2. In the film I’m pretty sure she’s the real Lena but mutated. The mutation was in her blood so she’s changed.

3. I’m not really sure.

4. She accepted her fate and didn’t want to fight it. She just let go.

5. She cheated on her husband and he found out and then volunteered for the suicide mission. She volunteers to atone for her betrayal. I think she just wanted to redeem herself.

dvm4muk,"It's a symbol called the ouroboros. The snake eating its own tail, which looks like an eight, symbolizes the endless cycle of death and rebirth in a bunch of ancient religions and cultures. 

Breaking down all sorts of DNA to make new, sometimes beautiful, sometimes terrifying lifeforms is what the shimmer is all about. Lena has that line (paraphrased) to the interrogator that the shimmer wasn't trying to destroy by breaking down old matter. It was simply creating by rearranging that matter in new ways.

The tattoo is also a sign of how much everyone is blending together in the shimmer. You see it pretty prominently on the soldier, the paramedic and Lena at various parts of the movie. The copy-Lena burned to death in the lighthouse, but there is precious little difference between them now. The shimmer has left its mark on Lena, and there is no going back to the person she used to be. 

The conversation in the boat was all about great events marking the end of an old life.

From my understanding, in the book it is indeed an organism, a fungus of some type.  In the movie, it's not clear.  The 'trees' outside the lighthouse are crystalline.  They describe the 'being' as without want or direction.  The very first thing we find out about the Natalie Portman character is that she doesn't remember eating, at all, which would imply some sort of shutdown of her biological functions.  It was certainly a natural phenomenon, but a biological phenomenon?  That's IMHO indefinite, and that it's indefinite adds to the movie because it makes one question what life actually is.

I still have some hard times with the following -> I am not a genius but heh; here are some suggestions for the team:
SPOILERS AHEAD
* what about sending, I don't know...**drones or any probes 
 and machines using tether**...?

* The whole prism principle, I like it, even if there is some sort of refraction effect, any engineer in signal could analyze the frequency response curve and counter it? At least we can do that in real time today for the vast majority of the radio-wave spectrum... just saying
*it reminds me of [Eden](https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/5xprq3/rt_eden_its_an_endless_world/) and the Closure Virus and phase 2 Colloid/Disclosure Virus*

* If you want to keep connection then use a **freaking CABLE** !!! I don't know plug it to an helicopter, or just go underground...or build a pipeline that goes into the zone and is sealed like a glassed tunnel in a vast aquarium?

* I agree with you, why not using any protections? like AT ALL??? The actresses literally can't stop having their rifles with them (is it some sort of feminist BS or just to show they're scared? dunno) but they can't have gas mask or any sort of **biohazard protections**?


the briefing:
> huh guys, we've been sending humans without protection contrary to any of the other protocols ever made for the past 100 years or so, and I mean...huh...we can clearly see that the shimmer is weird and has some funky tripy acid like going on inside and we don't know shit about because no one ever came back so far, I mean except this highly trained special force guy that is now dying from internal bleeding. hmmm
okay cool, let's send you there with backpacks and nice looking yellow tents. have fun!

* oh shit someone just got pulled into the water screaming, let's all NOT REACT and act like we've been smoking weed the whole afternoon (actually I believe that maybe the pollen of the shimmer and fine particles might have some sort of effect on the minds, therefore would also explain **the memory loss** at first)

* okay so now we've seen this fucking giant mutated fearless alligator (it HAS to be albino because white people are bad? m'kay... but also because it looks ""mutated"" for everyone...) but next thing you know they're **happily taking their little fucking boat** made of plastic that can be turned over by even a half sized albino alligator...?
 *is it again the drug effect and memory loss at play?*


Now regarding the plot itself:
* how come the asteroid now turned meteorite was never identified ? when the zone was small enough they have been able to do something, like **contain it**?

* okay I won't discuss symbolism but... lighthouse, a hole, a white one, a dark one, phosphorous, etc... it is a bit over the edge and **lack subtlety** from my opinion

* So after they get in the shimmer, they can't remember the past 3-4 days or so they say, correct? It is fairly similar to what Kane's copy is experiencing or Lean when she is being interrogated... making me wonder, **aren't they already have been duplicated and their bodies have been already be transformed, only their consciousness remaining but leaving bit by bit**? okay maybe it's a long shot and creates more issues regarding the rest of the movie...

* what happened to the guy in the pool, the one that Kane cut open? **Why is he evolving in such a way**? (only time we see that kind of mutation)

* **why is the ocean completely ignored?** Literally they can't stop talking about the coast, thus the water... water is not has limited and constrained as tress and rocks and all, it is fluid and fully open for the fishes and other organisms to leave at their will... hmm easier to ignore I guess

* There is this interesting sentence at the beginning: **""I don't remember eating""** -basically she might not be a carbon based life form.

* Why are their inside moving? but they seem to be able to still function almost normally? once again I don't talk about the symbolism of the movement and the changes - **I am proposing the fact that they are already not themselves**.

* it also really gave me a **""video game""** feeling; a bit like BLAME!",7zqsdy

dvm2usz,"That's what I thought too, I did get the doppleganger as a misunderstood being (read: alien) when it/she sees the ""real"" Lena go out the lighthouse, like some sort of sad look in its eyes.

Also, it got some Under The Skin flair too. Excellent sci-fi movie.",7zqsdy
dvlxb9q,"maybe the autophagy is a part of another theme? Like the alien thing becoming the character. There's a very old illustration of an ouroboros in a text called the chrysopeia of cleopatra encircling the inscription 'one is all'.

dw9hiow,"I think you hit the nail right on the head. Humanity has an inherent drive toward self-destruction right beneath the surface. Lena and Kane had a happy life together, but for some reason (or for no reason) Lena cheats on Kane which he find out about. Their journey into the shimmer is the visualization of what the fallout and spiral into depression looks like after that. It’s a journey into their own dark places in their psyche. Her fellow squad mates are all running from something in their past lives and ultimately succumb to their demons in a way. 

The final sequence with her doppelgänger that was created from her own dna in her own image she first tried to get away from but it almost suffocated her. Then she fights it and it knocks her down. Only until she recognizes it as a part of her and sees herself in this darkness is she able to control it. She makes the final decision to annihilate it instead of her, which I ultimately read as she has seen and accepted the absolute rock bottom in her but chooses to turn away from it and get better. 

When her and Kane reunite they recognize each other but also feel like they are different people. The glow in their eyes I think show that their experiences still live on through them. ",7zqsdy

duqqiwd,"I've read the first book and am currently reading the second book, but I know they are concerned about sending in anything but the most basic technology because of something that happened in earlier expeditions.  
The people being sent in weren't so much exploring as being part of a larger experiment on how Area X affects people.  In the book the group of women (the 12th expedition) had to be hypnotized to even enter Area X. The movie takes the DNA of the book and makes something new from it :)
Someone who has read all 3 books might have more insight but this is what I recall from the bit I've read.",7zqsdy

dur0bfr,"I'm only speaking for the movie here. I don't think those questions are nitpicking, but I think the best answer is that stories about the US government sending tanks to fight scary space things ala Aliens just isn't the kind of movie Alex Garland wanted to make. Some stories are told primarily to convey a sequence of events that is satisfying in-universe. (See most action movies) Others are nearly incomprehensibe plot wise, but that's okay because the director is making the movie more to communicate with you as an audience member than to care about the events in the story. (See 2001: A Space Odyssey, among others.) Annihilation felt like a 30/70 split between the two for me. If they sent tanks in, we wouldn't have this very personal look at the nature of survival, self-destruction and the cycle of 1 becoming 2 becoming 1 again.",7zqsdy

What I've read so far is that 1) the bruise she gets fighting the alligator monster is exactly where the tattoo ends up being, 2) apparently the guy who had his bowels cut open had the tattoo on his arm too, and that 3) it resembles an ouroboros, which thematically matches the phenomenon the psychologist turns into, which looks like a microcosm of the universe forming and reforming, i.e. eternal recurrence.",7zqsdy

Think about the DNA changes like a river. She could try to fight the current (like Lena). She could try to get to the shore and study it, to observe and try to understand the river (like the Dr).

dv7885r,"I've done a couple analyses of the film looking through the lens of Carl Jung, the psychiatrist. 

He has some thoughts on the Ouroboros, the infinity tattoo in the movie.

""The alchemists, who in their own way knew more about the nature of the individuation process than we moderns do, expressed this paradox through the symbol of the Ouroboros, the snake that eats its own tail. The Ouroboros has been said to have a meaning of infinity or wholeness. In the age-old image of the Ouroboros lies the thought of devouring oneself and turning oneself into a circulatory process, for it was clear to the more astute alchemists that the prima materia of the art was man himself. **The Ouroboros is a dramatic symbol for the integration and assimilation of the opposite, i.e. of the shadow**. This 'feed-back' process is at the same time a symbol of immortality, since it is said of the Ouroboros that he slays himself and brings himself to life, fertilizes himself and gives birth to himself. **He symbolizes the One, who proceeds from the clash of opposites**, and he therefore constitutes the secret of the prima materia which ... unquestionably stems from man's unconscious.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros

The reason Lena is the one who ends up with it at the end of her ordeal is because she is that person whom Jung describes, the ""one who proceeds from the clash of opposites."" In the same way that the Ouroboros is a ""dramatic symbol,"" a movie too, is a drama that unfolds in a sequence of symbols.

In the physics of the movie, being inside the shimmer means your DNA is getting scrambled with everything and everyone else, explaining the transmission from person to person.",7zqsdy

Lena also stated after emerging from her tent something to the effect of ""I feel disoriented.""

This theory would also explain why: teams don't just enter near the vicinity and come back with samples, teams don't immediately turn back, teams may survive longer than planned (i.e. outlasting their rations because they could've eaten anything within the shimmer and not remembered), etc.

I could also be 100% incorrect.",7zqsdy

dvloo0r,"The shimmer distorts everything that comes into contact with it -- electronic signals, memories, DNA. It doesn't seem to have any deliberate consciousness or agenda of its own, behaving more like an organic machine than anything else. (That being said, my pet theory is that it actually may have wanted to understand humanity, and so it went to the trouble of creating the copy in the lighthouse -- but that is my two cents.)

Lena volunteered to go into the shimmer when it became clear that her husband only agreed to go because he was disillusioned by the affair she had been having. She feels guilty (""I owe it to him"") and thinks that if she put him in that mess, however indirectly, then it's her job to get him out of it.

The team is picked off one by one -- the first one being mauled by the bear-man hybrid, the second one going mad with symptoms similar to dementia as the shimmer's distortion effect warps her mind, the third passively accepting what is happening to her and letting it overtake her instead of dying in misery, the fourth one seemingly merging with the core of the shimmer or at least being broken down for the raw materials used to produce the Lena copy. 

In the end, the copy is too perfect. It assimilates/reproduces the human drive toward self-destruction, burning to death, while a significantly changed Lena returns to the outside world. The question of ""is she the real Lena?"" doesn't matter because the shimmer has already left its mark on her -- quite literally in the case of the tattoo that wasn't hers or the shining eyes in the final scene.

Some one who needs to change, die and then be reborn (might head to the shimmer after this post).

I like how the 'villain' wasn't a traditional nemesis.  There were mutated creatures and the aliens were creepy but the shimmer itself was a much more abstract thing than we're used to getting in sci-fi horror movies.

There is no ""point"" to life either, it also does nothing other than to perpetuate itself in very creative means. 

The thing is that the movie presents the notion that alien life might be non-sentient (unlike its typical portrayal of intelligent, humanoid beings) and still behave in interesting ways or have drastic effects on us.

In this way, the film also alludes to cancer ---- another non-sentient phenomenon which leads people to self-annihilate in very peculiar and horrendous ways

There are huge plot holes within it, but overall the idea is to show that people/life is fragile and can easily be replicated, altered, destroyed, etc. There's also the theme of self-destruction. I don't care much for the ""symbolism"" in the movie. I appreciate the tension, mood and visuals more than the actual plot. ",7zqsdy
dvzsdui,"I think it has several themes, the most prominent being the urge to self-destruct vs. the urge to live. Each character is self-destructive in their own way--in the end, the alien, attempting to mimic humans, destroys itself as well. Lena facilitates this happening--she saves herself by destroying ""herself.""  Lena's urge to survive wins out over her urge to self-destruct, which is why she survives.

 The other big theme I noticed was identity. What does it mean to be yourself, and how well do you really know other people? Is a close that copies everything about a person still a clone, or is it a person? Lena never really ""knew"" her husband, so does it matter that she has a clone now instead of the real husband? 
",7zqsdy
dvzl5fl,"Think about what drives the characters - of those who make it - towards the lighthouse:

Kane: Hopelessness caused from discovering his wife was cheating on him.
Lena: guilt over the fact that her cheating drove Kane toward the lighthouse.
Dr Ventress: a selfish desire to know what the lighthouse is - emboldened by her impending death from cancer. 

Their different motivations result in different outcomes.

Kane is replicated and his original destroyed but his twin endures.
Lena is replicated but her twin is destroyed.
Dr Ventress her original is nowhere to be seen, but in her place seems to be a replicant who is also destroyed and her spunk is used to create Lena's replicant.

Map their motivations to their outcomes and what does this tell you?

Kane's weakness implies he completely abandons his sense of self to the 'other'.  He goes on, but as something else.  That he endures at all is due to the fact that he at least starts out with others in mind - namely the betrayal of his wife.  He is the opposite of self centered - but pathologically so.  He is never able to constitute a sense of identity beyond that betrayal, and thus is replaced.

Lena is going in to save her husband and for her that means confronting and ridding herself of the selfishness that drove her to cheat on him.  That's what the lighthouse reveals to her.  And it's no accident that the most selfish person overall in the story - Dr Ventress becomes the goo that forms Lena's double.  Lena destroys her double implying she is destroying that selfishness in her being.  But her original endures - implying that of the three she is the only one that is able to create some balance between the self and the other.  And thus the only one to truly avoid self-destructive annihilation in any sense.

Dr Ventress is completely destroyed - implying that without some regard or concept of the other in your being is to negate the self entirely.  There is no self without the other.

Lighthouse - the light shone upon the self when you confront your own self-destructive tendencies.  The journey doesn't always end in balance and self awareness.  That awareness can destroy you too.",7zqsdy

> Though they frequently try to visit the ideas of self destruction, the plot doesn't seem to actual reflect this in anything but exposition alone.

I think self-destruction was a bigger part of the plot than you're giving credit for. 

* Everyone but Lena went into the Shimmer and died, because they went in for self-destructive reasons. But Lena went in because she owed Kane. She wasn't self-destructing, she was trying to *save* something, which is why she survived and succeeded.

* I think that the doubles aren't just clones or mimics, but are actually imprinted with specific aspects of the originals. Kane's double was the part of Kane that *wasn't* self-destructive. So the real Kane (full of self-destruction) immediately destroyed himself, and the double (lacking self-destruction) left the Shimmer and sought out Lena.

* With Lena, this situation is reversed: she made her double self-destructive, essentially infecting the Shimmer with humanity's self-destructive tendencies. So the Shimmer destroys itself, while Lena survives.

Just my (long-winded) two cents. Great movie!",7zqsdy

The books go into more detail regarding the nature of the border, and why the expeditions had to enter it via land. Some key excerpts:

 >The border did not allow half measures: Once you touched it, it pulled you in (or across?).

>It had discrete boundaries, including to about one mile out to sea. The military had put up floating berms and patrolled the area ceaselessly.

>The border extended about seventy miles inland from the lighthouse and approximately forty miles east and forty miles west along the coast. It ended just below the stratosphere and, underground, just above the asthenosphere.

>It had a door or passageway through it into Area X.

>You could not get under the border by any means on the seaward side. You could not tunnel under it on the landward side. You could not penetrate it with advanced instrumentation or radar or sonar. From satellites peering down from above, you would see only wilderness in apparent real time, nothing out of the ordinary. Even though this was an optical lie.

It's funny that you mention using a navy destroyer.

>The night the border had come down, it had taken ships and planes and trucks with it, anything that happened to be on or approaching that imaginary but too-real line at the moment of its creation, and for many hours after, before anyone knew what was going on, knew enough to keep distant. Before the army moved in. The plaintive groan of metal and the vibration of engines that continued running as they disappeared … into something, somewhere. A smoldering, apocalyptic vision, the con towers of a destroyer, sent to investigate with the wrong intel, “sliding into nothing” as one observer put it… Some [of the sailors], though, just stood there, watching as their ship disintegrated, and then they crossed over or died or went somewhere else…

",7zqsdy
duvy763,"None of the problems from the movie were explained very well and it left me not liking the movie because of it.

If people keep disappearing, why not put them on harnesses and send them in a few feet, then a few yards, then 100 yards, etc? They had absolutely no details from inside the shimmer due to complete idiocy. 

A scientist with a portable microscope can easily see the changes in the cells, but when the husband and then Portman come out, they can't see the genetic changes with months' worth of testing.

Everything in the shimmer dies when the alien/being dies, but the Kane imposter and Portman are fine. No explanation given.

The Kane imposter left the shimmer and somehow got past the entire army and government undetected to return 'home.'

5 scientists are sent into the shimmer alone with no military personnel/support.

The shimmer has been growing for 3 years yet somehow with dozens of support staff, army personnel, scientists and engineers/builders making TWO military bases, no one knows about it. They evacuated a town but no one knows about it. As one character pointed out, there are 20 satellites overhead but no one knows about it. Hundreds of people know this thing exists but somehow Russia, China, and their network of spies have no idea it's going on.

I agree with this completely. 

As soon as the alien began mimicing Lena in the lighthouse I felt that she was literally dancing with herself. Indeed, a few of her movements resembled dance. 

And when she runs for the door to escape (herself) it nearly kills her. The pressure she exerts on the door to escape is equal to the pressure applied to herself by the shadow/alien/clone. *** The harder she fights the harder the shadow presses down on her. ***

It's possible that the guy with the worm in his belly was dealing with some kind of internal issue of being a worm? 

I, too, found it really interesting that Ventress dissolved into light, which is typically symbolic of highest truth and light of creation or God. 

And then the alien itself, the floating orb, was some kind of morphing light. Which really suggested to me that this thing was not evil or nefarious. It was something higher. ",7zqsdy
dv833u3,"Yeah, I would agree with that.

The movie did a great job of capturing the essence of the book imo [unnerving uncertainty, eerie beauty, the futility of familliaraity, the struggles of identity] and at first I thought the lighthouse change was lazy, but I kind of like the classical note of ""fighting a dark mimic"" you know? Like in Zelda or something, I think it honestly worked really well.

dw9sp95,"> how this post can have over 12k comments yet still somehow be a dud at the box office

Because:

1. Most people (i.e. - the masses who are responsible for the vast majority of the revenue) are not that enthusiastic about film. They just watch stuff looking to be entertained for a bit. 

2. This film (unlike most blockbusters) is thought-provoking, i.e. - there's stuff to discuss after you watch it. It has many layers. It has many interpretations. How much is there to discuss regarding ""Black Panther"" for example? There isn't. Okay, fun film, got some nice action and what not - but it's just shallow entertainment.  ""Annihilation"" is art.  

3. ""Paramount"" didn't want to pour any more money on the marketing of this film after they decided to push it to Netflix, so it got much less marketing than comparable sci-fi flicks (e.g. ""Ex-Machina"").  Because of various cost-effectiveness calculations they still reached the conclusion they'd make more money just screening it in theaters than by selling it to Netflix U.S - but figured that internationally the opposite is true.
They basically just looked for the most risk-free way of cutting their (predicted) losses on the film. The failures of other ""niche"" films they produced in the recent period made them more worried about spilling more money into it, or about giving up the opportunity to make it Netflix's problem...

What I've been thinking about lately is how the cost of film would likely remain relatively still, as humanity (and its economy) continue to grow at a much faster rate, leading to a situation where it would always be feasible to produce any film - as long as you have a creator who's devoted enough and a production company that's willing to sacrifice some profitability for the sake of art.

Right now we're still in a situation where a movie like ""Annihilation"" costs $55M - and has a risk of not having enough audience. But what if this were 2050 or 2100 and not 2018?  There likely would automatically be a sufficient audience to fund this film - even if it's only a minuscule minority of the 50 billion people who might be living then.

A good way to mitigate this problem until such point in the future - is to involve some kind of crowd-sourcing into it : I wouldn't mind paying double the price for a ticket in advance, if it guaranteed that this movie would get made and screened in theaters, and I'm sure many others would do so as well. I prefer to see a few excellent films in theater and pay a lot for each, then to watch a ton of crap movies and pay a little for each.

Why couldn't they take one step inside and then leave, see what effects it has?

If they're scientists, why don't they take test and equipment with them rather than guns?

dwddnsj,"> What a pointless attempt at mixing in some science, only to make the movie dumber. Kinda ironic.

As a synthetic biologist, excited to see the exposition of the biological future we've not yet been shown in movies, I felt the same way unfortunately.  The biology too just was *so* wrong that it just made the characters seem dumb.  And it's not just a suspension of disbelief issue - it's just clearly conducted with a very superficial understanding of biology.  And the trouble is that really deflates much of the weight that the movie could have otherwise easily carried.  

To the point that the film quickly became a 'here's an idea I have, encrypted in themes' movie rather than any kind of science fiction.  The movie becomes entirely allegorical and symbolic. Which, actually, is just fine.  Just a very different kind of movie than I was expecting/hoping for.",7zqsdy

dwgn3e3,"""We're five women.""   
""No, we're five scientists!""

That's not impressive writing on any level. Women can also be scientists, wow who would have thought. They're so science'y that it trumps their gender. Groundbreaking stuff. If the film had been made in the sixties. 

The dialogue was leaden. All five major characters have conveniently contrived personal issues, presented in less than subtle ways.

A sci-fi film can actually have shoddy science and work well as a film. Unless you make science a major point of the film, in which case the science should be atleast somewhat plausible. The science in this film made little sense, and in many cases it was flat out wrong.

And I disagree; Tuva Novotny can not be given a pass because of her english. She speaks very good and fluent english in interviews. Like you say, she acts well in Norwegian - and she's Swedish and not native norwegian. She has shown in the past her acting is not hindered by using another language.

The CGI was terrible. That is, it was great if you prefer films with CGI plastered all over everything until the film looks like a MMORPG. But it never looked real, and I'm not sure if the effects were meant to look real or meant to look like Kingdoms of Amalur or some such game. 

The film has many logical holes and things that dont make sense. It attemps to hide them by steeping the film in an appropriate layer or mystical and profound vagueness. At the same time the plot, the characters and the Shimmer as a symbolic device is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. It's a pretty good way to earn critical praise these days though I guess.

I can see why the film was sold to Netflix. It's not terrible, but far from great. And a huge step down from Garlands previous films.",7zqsdy

I actually disagree with a lot of what you've said but the other stuff's down to opinion, like I thought a lot of the acting was okay and I felt like the characters had enough defining characteristics to make them feel like real people and move the movie along without bogging us down with a bunch of unnecessary details that ultimately wouldn't have added much to the movie, since at it's center it's more a mystery than an character ensemble piece, like if we were given details for every character to the extent that we got them for Natalie Portman's character the movie would be four times longer and would have had nothing added to it. 

Something you didn't directly address that I didn't like though was some of the dialogue ""Do you think he knows about our affair?"" was the worst offender for me, but there are others scattered throughout.

The tattoo comes from Anya, and is being diffused out across people in the shimmer. Similar to how Kane picked up a southern accent by the recording he left at the end.

I don't think Annihilation is an example of an unreliable narrator per se. Lena might be unreliably relaying events to the people debriefing/interrogating her, but we, the audience, still see things as they happened. Such as how we see her watch that video recording of Kane at the very end, but the Area X base doesn't put him in extremely high security after they finish talking to her, which you'd expect them to do if she had told them that he was likely, or even possibly, a shimmer clone.",7zqsdy

I have zero problems with the deviations he made, and personally I think it was a damn good film.

durirhm,"So, I was with you after first seeing it and marinating on it for a day, I have come to the following conclusions:


1) Finding the tower and the crawler early in the narrative, like the book, could have messed up the pacing of the film, which constantly has the team pushing forward. If we had a place they return to, it would have been a lot of downtime. While I miss the tower, I'm ok with its exclusion.

2) What I'm *not* ok with is the exclusion of the never-ending sentence ""the strangling fruit will..."". I think that would have been a perfect through-line for the narrative. It's probably my favorite part of Area X in the novel. That said, I get that it doesn't jive with the Alien/Meteor stuff. 


3) I'm so with you. I love Authority, it's probably my favorite, and not having room for Control really sucks. I was generally really disappointed by the ending - it just made the story too concrete, when the entire point of Southern Reach trilogy is abstraction and mystery. That it's unknowable. *That said* - I understand that it was made to be a blockbuster for a massive audience, and most people need that resolution.",7zqsdy
durd3l8,"I agree, very disappointed no tower and no crawler. The words on the wall and the wall being actually alive would have made for a stunning visual and added creepiness. If the shimmer truly burned down, which appears to be the case, then sequels would have to be drastically different than the books. I hated the very last scene of the movie, was so obvious, you saw it coming a mile away. Should have ended more similar to the book and left Area X intact, not burned down.",7zqsdy

The characters having names really bothered me. It also bothered me that they changed the mechanism for them going nuts. The tower in addition to the words were huge losses for this plot. 

Overall, I think we got the ending we did because they weren't going to be able to do the sequels. I remember hearing that because it was so out there, the producers were worried that they wouldn't be able to do the film's true to the books. They had to change the story. The ending makes sense. The crawler created a clone that was mimicking her movements and so held on to the grenade without really knowing what it was. It was just a doppelganger, and when it encountered the fire, it spread it everywhere. They put in a lot of lines about self destruction, to hint at the action. On a basic level, the alien was copying something it didn't know was harmful. 

I liked the Movie overall, even though I was disappointed they cut a bunch out. The producers didn't have the balls to make a screenplay closer to the books. ",7zqsdy

> It signifies infinity, wholeness, two cells dividing, yin and yang, and echoes, like the Shimmer’s refractions. Anya first has the tattoo, which became part of Lena. And a soldier from a previous mission had the tattoo before her. Alchemists used the symbol of the ouroboros to represent integration of the conscious and the unconscious into the self, two halves of a whole. Jung wrote: “The integration of these opposing aspects of the personality is symbolized by the snake that bites its own tail, the ouroboros, another archetype. The ouroboros is a dramatic symbol for the integration and assimilation of the opposite (i.e. of the shadow self). This feedback process is at the same time a symbol of immortality, since it is said that the ouroboros slays himself and brings himself to life again, fertilizes himself and gives birth to himself.”",7zqsdy

""Getting to the lighthouse"" isn't a test or a goal the alien seems to ""care"" about putting things through - whether consciously or not 

It's simply where the alien ""landed"" and where its effects or activity seems to be strongest at the moment.

And - natural selection always happens whenever you have variance of properties - along side differential odds of survival (that are affected by said properties). 
you don't need a ""shimmer"" for that, every disease, natural disaster, etc. could be seen as another ""step"" or ""component"" in the grand process of natural selection.",7zqsdy

Each character died due to their decisions & character direction, with the exception of Sheppard, not a lot I could figure out about her.

Lena makes it to the Shimmer cause she doesn't buy into it, her goal is to get out - it says so quite clearly. Ventress makes it to the centre bc that's her entire goal - to find it, and understand it. She went into the Shimmer not expecting nor wanting to come out, so she doesn't. It seems that Ventress & Lena, and then Anya & Radek, are meant to play off each other, though Anya & Radek are explored seperately. Lena's overall arc links to Kane, but that's only about the ending, not the journey through the Shimmer.

dvtjqb5,"The moment Kane cuts open his fellow soldier with a knife during the recording was significant. You could read it in their body language that they were ""gonna go through with it,"" as friends and with trust in each other. There was no force involved in that scene. It might have been the idea of the guy being cut open, in fact.

The most telling part of that scene was Kane's reaction to finding the worms underneath. That face was a face filled with relief and amazement. The typical reaction is that of the women's reactions--disgust, shock, horror. The reason this is typical is because, in passing, seeing the actual person, rather than just the simplified, surface persona we use for our daily lives, truly warrants that kind of reaction. People are messy, if you really get to know them, if you look underneath. Now, if we are applying a depth psychology lens (I've understood this film through Jung, and have a lot of writing if you want to read more; just let me know) to this film, then Kane's reaction to discovering the worms was because he had always felt ""something"" was wrong, either in his life with his distant wife who was cheating on him--of which he didn't seem to be fully aware--or in his, and his team's, experience in the shimmer. Often times, getting the chance to look under the hood, so to speak, and see that there is, in fact, something wrong, can be a huge relief. In Kane's case then, the problems of life weren't just a figment of his imagination, they had an objective, external cause and for the first time he got to ""look inside"" another man and see that he had ""internal"" problems, as well.

yes. Yes, that's exactly it. They're doing that to study them.

Ever consider that... they had amnesia as was clearly mentioned? Also locations seem to not 100% be the same in the shimmer. It's also pretty clear they may be doubting her story the entire time.

I described this in another post. It actually kind of works out better as a ""canary in a coal mine"" type situation. If they all camped out in the guard house, and the bear came up they'd all get fucked. If one of them gets taken out and screams, then they all know to get the fuck out of dodge.

Also the pool of people for this mission is going to be small as the number of people who can know about it is kept to a minimum. They weren't exactly fielding the very best people in the world for this, they were sending whoever they could. 

>-What happened to the whole ""losing track of time"" thing that they introduced literally the second they went into the shimmer? It would have been cool to keep exploring that concept. Instead, they just mention it once and it's completely forgotten about. When Portman mentions ""we've been traveling for 6 days now"" later in the film. Like what the fuck? We can keep track of time now? The first part of the shimmer didn't happen?

It's inconsistent and unpredictable, like a lot of the effects of The Shimmer.

>-This would make the movie irrelevant so it's not a real complaint but like why the fuck doesn't their mission start at the coast? Like, that would bypass every single problem. It's a straight shot on the beach to the lighthouse instead of going into the deadly, spooky, shit-show of a jungle.

You *really* want an answer to that? Remember the bear? Imagine what the shimmer could do to a shark or any kind of sea-life. Do you really want to fuck with that? I think the reason is pretty clear given their desperation: They already sent a group of people in and they all died. This is not a situation that can be solved by more guns, as evidence by the many squads of soldiers they have sent in and lost.",7zqsdy

I just want to step in here and say, people might be making a lot of assumptions about what this film is are not giving audiences enough credit. I saw it yesterday and I can 100% understand the C cinemascore. It is not Ex Machina.

1.  Very stilted performances from everyone not named Natalie Portman. Jennifer Jason Leigh is AWFUL.

2.  Visually the film looks bad. The CGI is fine, but the lighting looks tv-esque for most of the beginning of the movie.

3.  The script (responsible for many of the bad performances from good actors, I think) has a lot of clunkers. A ton of clunky exposition especially.

4.  Yes, the Sci-fi finale is creepy and interesting. But the journey there was not worth it.

—The characters that aren't Lena are underdeveloped, which I think is by design, but it still makes their motivations unclear, especially when hothead ties up the other three. It's just such a self-destructive plan, but the movie revolves around things self-destructing, literally, figuratively, accidentally, on purpose, in every way imaginable, so it's just another example of that, in my opinion. 

—The dialogue is clunky, and the film can't decide whether it's a monster horror movie or heady scifi with a lot of big ideas that don't pay off.

That's just what I heard from my friends. I like it, I think it pays off all the ideas it needs to pay off, and leaves ambiguous the things it can for the sake of being interesting. I don't think it's perfect, and it's not my favorite Alex Garland work, but I think it largely works at what it's trying to do.

I disagree on that point, actually. I don't think it was two different deer, I think it was one deer and its echo, similar to Kane's echo, or Lena's. If you think about that scene again, you'll remember that they moved almost exactly at the same time, in the exact same way, like Lena's echo did to her. Down to every step and turn of its head.

Not only that, but one of them was corrupted, in the same way the bear was. Remember how one deer had blossoms at the end of its antlers. The other one, the echo, didn't. Also, the echo had those black spots on its fur, like the bear did. And it's head and face were gaunt, almost skeletal.

When she begins to pass out the alien turns with her and falls. I think that, had she relaxed sooner, both her and the alien would have back away together.

The Shimmer is not bound by what we would consider normal physics. The word usage is just the expedition team trying to make sense of, and describe a phenomenon that is utterly beyond their ability to comprehend. Just think of refraction as a metaphor for whatever is actually going on.

Rather than breaking down the world into something grotesquely painful (aside from the screambear), the Shimmer was constantly reforging the environment. We saw a functional ecosystem where flora and fauna continued on as expected, albeit with constant changes, and nothing appeared to be in any unnatural pain (aside from the screambear - seriously wth). It's only horrifying to humans who fear or despise the changes and not being human. Tessa Thompson's character saw the Shimmer as something beautiful to become a part of - and so she did. At the end of the movie I felt regret that the lighthouse burned and that the Shimmer disappeared.

I had assumed that her self-destructive nature is specifically what caused the clone to accept burning up, accept its own annihilation, as it was mirroring her physically, genetically, and also psychologically. She had a nice life and destroyed it by having an affair and growing distant from her husband... by going into the shimmer instead of staying with her husband while he recovered.

I think we would agree that her clone chose to light everything on fire instead of just burning up by itself, when it reached out and touched different parts of the lighthouse to ignite them. But after considering your comment I see that I am probably incorrect about Lena's destructive tendencies, because the other people who went to the lighthouse before Lena were all far more self-destructive, so they would have succeeded where she didn't (if that's what truly ended the shimmer).

Regarding your comment about Ventress (the psychologist) I think you missed one key point. When Lena first approached her in the hole beneath the lighthouse, the person she confronted wasn't the original Ventress. You could see Ventress' face (while her back was to Lena) and it was still being formed in the same way that Lena's copy took time to form. She did not turn and face Lena until her face was fully formed. It's interesting to think about what happened to the original Ventress, but I don't believe that was her based on what we saw after Lena got there. 

And I don't really understand the purpose of what the Ventress clone was saying, or the ""fireworks"" she made to show Lena. That part turned my fiance off the movie because it made little sense. I really don't understand the purpose of the shimmer, the clones, the shimmer destroying itself, the floating orb... there are so many questions I have, although I still enjoyed the movie and loved how horrifying the idea of changing a person was, changing on a cellular level, turning into something completely new yet still the same.

dw2hw6b,"There's a lot more to think about than  what you described. Let me first start by saying I loved this movie and I've seen the movie 4 times now. 

So, on a macro level, the movie is about cancer. Dr Ventress had cancer and Lena is a microbiologist that specializes in some sort of cancer research. The movie alludes to the destructive nature of the disease and how it affects host. Also on a macro scale, there are deep set themes of self destruction which are placed heavily throughout the film. 

On a micro scale, here we have a form of alien life unlike ever imagined. We grow up having images of alien life as being beings. But we come to find at the end that the alien is more of a like a phenomenon. It's not self aware, doesn't even know it's there, but it dramatically effects all DNA it comes in contact with. Not only does it change DNA, but the change is deeply affected by certain aspects of its surrounding environment and becomes apart of the change. We see this many times: trees + ocean = crystal trees / bear + terrified human(Cassie) = bear with human like skull and cry / Kane + guy he cut open = Kane with the guy he cut open's tattoo and southern accent (you can hear Kane's accent has changed dramatically in his video suicide recording). The way in which a human is feeling can also affect the direction your metamorphosis goes. Josie decided she did not want to see or fight what was happening to her. She was at peace with knowing she was changing and turned into one of those tree figures that are structured like humans. Before she went on the mission, she was a cutter, and used to do so in order to feel ""alive."" The experiences she has endured in the shimmer have made her finally feel alive and her death is still with life now that she is a tree. Anya was a recovering drug addict, and often times with people who are in recovery, they finally feel they have control over their lives. Anya was quickly losing this control and it sent her in a state of psychosis over everything that was happening. 

The psychosis that affects the team is probably my favorite aspect of the film. Here the DNA refraction process is slow and brutal, and they are consciously being witness to the terrifying deterioration of their brains. With Kane, he wasn't even sure if he even used to be a man or not. With Dr Ventress, she NEEDED to see what was at the lighthouse with more determination than any of the characters, but as the final stages of the metamorphosis are unfolding, she tells Lena that she is beyond wanting to see it anymore. It's too much and it's a type of pain unknown to man. 

It's here during Dr Ventress' final stage that the destruction of the shimmer begins. She is seen spouting out light and molecules and most importantly, her cancer. The refraction process is strongest where the initial impact happens (here in the lighthouse and can be compared to a ""Big Bang"" process of this new world) and cell division has become full on cloning beings. A drop of blood is spilled within this process and is part Ventress, part Lena and part many things in between.  It's a slow process and doesn't start to fully culminate until Lena touches it, which is when it starts to truly become her. Since Lena was driven there to fight it, the clone somewhat allows this to happen, because it is her in a way. She tricks it with the grenade, and the clone now proceeds to do as Lena would, setting the place ablaze, further spreading the cancer which leads to cell destruction. Kane's clone also has the drive of Kane by finding Lena which we see in the beginning. 

Now that the shimmer is gone, all that is left of it is their Adam and Eve. Kane the clone, and Lena with her rapidly changing body. Together they will spread this phenomenon to all organisms over time. We see Kane in the beginning drink from the water, and Lena at the end drink from hers. It's now in the water supply and the process has begun. ",7zqsdy

I got the implication that his realization of his wife's affair was the answer (or part of the answer) to the question ""Why did this guy agree to go into the shimmer on a suicide mission?"" Not that it was as simple as she cheated = I'm going to go kill myself, but more that the failing marriage fed into his own impulse to self-destruct. Portman's character has the line ""I owe him"" as part of *her* reason for going into the shimmer, and at first it sounds like she's being a devoted wife. But after the whole story has unspooled, it's more an acknowledgment of the consequences of her own actions. That he was collateral damage of her impulse to self-sabotage.

For me, the not-awesomeness of their relationship augmented the story. Even if the real Kane and Lena had reunited at the end of the movie, they probably wouldn't have had a straightforward happy ending, because there's still the distance and betrayal between them. The implication that they're *both* the humanoid copy versions of themselves, to me, resets their relationship in a way that would be totally impossible for the real versions to do.

The biggest problem with the movie was that it was terribly edited. There was not a single thoughtful shot until the lighthouse. But the biggest problem was the interspersed interview clips.

I thought that the film was okay, but I was disappointed because it could’ve been much better. 


Portman’s and Isaac’s acting were both good, but I feel like the rest of the cast wasn’t as strong. Anya’s character was over the top. The dialogue was also sub par. I feel like there were plenty of opportunities for interesting and engaging discussions, but the topics were merely skimmed over. 


When Dr. Ventress and Lena conversed outside during their shift switch, they were starting to get into a good conversation about the biological and psychological processes that affect what we do and the decisions we make. Their conversation was cut short in favor of an action sequence. It ruined the mood for me.


Some lines I didn’t like had to do with the various references to the shimmer. You don’t have to mention it every time you’re talking with someone about it. The audience can probably figure out what you’re referring to. Other lines were way too obvious and didn’t enhance the interactions between characters.


The feeing of disorientation was well done at the beginning when the group first camped out. It had a sort of freaky psychedelic vibe to the whole thing. 


The CGI wasn’t the greatest either. I think the whole thing could’ve been executed better with some proper set design. 


Overall, I thought the movie had great source material to work with, but ended up falling flat. I really wanted to like this movie. I didn’t even think the ending at the lighthouse was all that. Lena’s biological background was also severely underused, and was instead spoon fed to us at a shallow level. There were some good moments, but they weren’t enough to distract from the film’s glaring problems. ",7zqsdy

She goes into the Shimmer with no expectation of ever getting out. Lena speculates that none of them had a reason to return, and so they didn't, even if not by their free will.

On the note of self-destruction, it's also commenting on how humanity would react to this scenario in general. When Lena faces the alien, it doesn't attack her. She attacks it, and it mirrors her behavior. She concludes that the Shimmer wasn't going to destroy anything, just change everything. Humans assumed they were in danger, sending team after team into the Shimmer, all dying. But what killed them? Nothing malicious. They were either killed by creatures or by their fellow soldiers, driven mad by their own fear and assumptions. That's the point of the ending.

Yeah, it's tough - so much of the movie is dissimilar from the book. In regards to character development, there is absolutely zero in the book, which is very quiet, etherial, and more about Area X (it's not called the Shimmer, which is a dumb name imo.) In the book, the characters don't even have names, just The Biologist and The Psychologist, which is a part of the fiction and very important to it. SO, your feeling that there is little character development is extremely on point - that is very specifically an important facet of the book.


Also, there is zero ""science"" in the novel - nothing is explained and it's left completely abstract.

Looking purely at their human stories, the film is about Lena's affair and their struggling in their relationship with the aftermath.  Hence, when Lena says to Kane at the end ""You're not really Kane, are you"" and Kane says ""Are you Lena?"" it's to symbolize how they came out the other end of their hardship (the affair and also symbolically the shimmer) and while they're still together, they aren't the same people anymore.

Alright, I think this movie loses 30 fresh/meta points if the cast were entirely male.

The CGI was distractingly bad in many spots.  It hurt the rest of the otherwise pretty film.

There's no tension because the opening scene of the movie quite literally tells you what's going to happen to the group that we're following.

In fact, the movie outright explains just about everything that's happening via dialogue, save for the exact ending which is a classic ""ooooooo!"" roll credits.  But by then, you already hate the husband character so much that you don't even really care.

Save for Portman, the expedition characters are more irritating than interesting.  

The villain is ultimately not scary and easily manipulated.

Their rifles have 100 round magazines.  

The technology still works after being abandoned seaside for months/years of effective lapsed time. 

Wormguts man made no sense.

I feel your analysis in this paragraph is spot on for the novel and movie (although to your point it handles better in the books)

> Afterwards my dad and I discussed what we had seen and some of the themes throughout, such as the all too obvious cancer references. I later went home to do some thinking and research on the film, and eventually I came to a conclusion that this film (and perhaps the novel too, although I haven't read it) is an adaptation or homage to HP Lovecraft's The Color out of Space in which a meteor falls to Earth and begins to infect the local ecosystem and distort reality because it is so vastly alien to anything we understand. In that sense maybe the unexplained and seemingly incoherent plot developments throughout the story are excusable simply because they intend to be Lovecraftian in nature, meaning they are not explained because they cannot be explained. If so, it's a creepy concept yet makes for an often unfulfilling story. That's why HP Lovecraft's concepts are so intriguing yet almost none of them translate to the silver screen well.

dvoai9t,">  It's one of those bad science fiction hand-waving excuses to drive the plot, like how learning a new language is somehow supposed to alter your perception of time in Arrival, but you've just got to give the film a break sometimes.

IDK about your life experiences, but I never had any music training growing up, and when I learned a little about music theory it changed the way I look at a lot of things; as far as sci-fi goes, I don't think it's that crazy that an alien language is such a ""mind melting"" (for lack of a better phrase) experience that it changes your perception of time, or at least the perception of time as a viewer that is locked into linear time.

As for this movie, what dialog was so awful? I've seen your complaint a few times, and I tend to think of myself as one who has little patience for bad dialog, but it never really set off my senses in this one. A few scenes def made me think ""why is this here"", like the first affair scene where we essentially just see Portman's back writhing (which was pretty much explained later), but I didn't have any real issue with the dialog; maybe I will on the second viewing.

Cancer seems to be the overriding theme of the movie, and while I'm still working on the final sequence(s) myself, I can't knock it for anything other than ""it's not a cut and dry story"", which imo is not the worst thing ever and doesn't automatically warrant a bad review.

Lena by the end was unlikable, none of the other poorly developed characters fates mattered or aligned with the idea of Area-X he was presenting. And the end, without intense theorizing of outcomes that weren't necessarily even intended, was Lena blowing up the Alien world with a grenade but uh-oh she's an alien too kind of. 

Not to mention that those two idiots had a conversation in a government building surrounded by scientists and likely audio/video recording where the words ""You're not Kane, are you?"" are met with ""I don't think so.""

dvmns9c,"Strange for me its rather the opposite way arround. Not that i dislike Arrival by any means. But i like Annihilation definitely more then Arrival (but again both good movies).

What i did not like on arrival:

- beeing able to perceive time in a circular way instead of a linear one by just learning a alien language, is really a stupid idea i think.Maybe the aliens have changed her phisiology and alterd her body by giving her some sensors inside her mind and body which enable her to perceive time in that way. But simply by learning another language, i found that kind of stupid.

- I also didnt like the fact that the aliens come to us because they need your help a few thousand years in the future, that just does not make any sense. If they are far more technological advanced then we are then they simply can control their own evolution (body and mind) by changing them up from the inside.So they wouldnt go in a evolution dead end. So that it is highly unlikely that the humans will evolve their intellect at any time in the futher faster then the aliens to not only catch up with them but even overtake them intellectualy.
This whole they need our help, because we as humans are just so special, no one can do the things we do attitude is just plain out stupid.

Kane went on the shimmer despite having a seemingly perfect life for a reason that is left unknown to the audience (some are saying the implication is that he knew about the affair, but based on the context of the flashback scenes and the way they were arranged, I'm not sure that is true). He wanted to destroy himself in one way or another. Lena is on a similar quest, feeling as though she can atone for her sins by confronting whatever is in the Shimmer. I think Leigh's character even says something about how it is an impulsive need to self-destruct at one point. Every one of the main characters is dealing with something like this, Lena is just the protagonist, so we get to see the rationality behind her decisions. It is all based around guilt. The self-destruction comes full circle in the end when she confronts her alien doppelganger; she literally destroys herself, and then the alien, slowly being consumed by fire from the phosphorus grenade, begins to touch the vines on the lighthouse, another overt representation of self-destruction.

3. This is open ended, it's all how you look at it. There are clues that can lean you one way or the other. Personally I think that it is the real her that makes it out. The shimmer in her eye is because the shimmer is now a part of her since she's been mutated.",7zqsdy

In the book, they explicitly say that those who made it out of the shimmer did so in such a way that they had no idea how to predict it.  In the movie, they hint at this, as the locus of the shimmer is able to teleport at will in the lighthouse.  The idea is that the Oscar Isaac character likely literally teleported from Area X to outside their house while Natalie Portman was painting it.

> What happened to the black girl with glasses? Did she become one of those flower trees? That's the best I can come up with since she said that she didn't want to fight it etc. She literally just vanished and the film gave no explanation...

Right before she vanishes, plants are growing out of her skin, so yes this is the most likely interpretation.  Thematically, IMHO she became part of the shimmer, instead of fighting it or confronting it or what not.

> I'm confused at the ending. Natalie Portman's character died then I assume? Since the ending shows it was an ""alien"" instead of her, what are we to make of this? Are Portman's character and her husband just going to make a better species?

This is all interpretation, but in the film the Natalie Portman character notes that they are all becoming part of the shimmer while in it, i.e. they're all exhibiting the same signs as other organic matter, the 'cancerous' cell growth or what not.  So, in a sense, it doesn't matter whether or not she died and got replaced by a doppelganger, or if it's the same woman who entered, the idea is that she's part of the phenomenon regardless.

First of all due to her face just barely finishing forming when she's encountered, something that doesn't make sense until we see it happen with Lena's mimic; but secondly because in the script it's written purposefully to give visual clues that she's a mimic:

>LENA ... Doctor Ventress?

> DR VENTRESS turns to LENA. She has the same expression as KANE when he appeared back home.

It leaves the annoying plothole of what exactly happened with the real Ventress but I guess it's sufficient to assume she died in there.

The whole point behind Lovecraft's work is that things are unexplained because they're unexplainable, simple as that.

No offense, but this kind of missing the point. This is akin to asking why a derelict ship full of Xenomorph eggs on LV-426 was sending out a distress beacon. The answer is no one knows and it really doesn't matter. 

The shimmer is so alien that it defies human understanding.  We don't really know if the shimmer *wants* anything. It isn't intentionally evil, but, like a tumor, its mere existence is mutually exclusive with life on Earth as we know it. It's a prism that refracts reality. The real story is Lena's motivation and internal struggle and how her journey through the shimmer changes her. The confrontation in the lighthouse can be interpreted largely as an allegory for her internal struggle.

As for my theories, the shimmer didn't attack Lena. It just mimics her actions. In my opinion, the clone thing *is* Lena, at least a part of her anyway. It's the part of her that believes she deserves to die for cheating on her loving husband. In the end that reflection of her allows itself to be destroyed because it absorbs the real Lena's guilt and shame. 

One theory I've read about about the phosphorus grenade that I really like was that the clone didn't understand what the fire was, but once it saw that it was burning everything it tried to take it back to its alter and assimilate it into itself. I've also read that phosphorus radiation one form of cancer treatment, no doubt reinforcing that allegory. 

Ultimately, I don't believe that the shimmer was intelligent, or even really alive. I think it was just deterministic in the way that it respond to stimuli, but since it doesn't operate within the rules of reality as we understand them it's impossible for us to derive a pattern from its behavior. It is the perfect cosmic horror. A true Lovecraftian fever dream",7zqsdy

Who said she wasn't replaced by a clone? I think it's either Lena has been changed by the shimmer or that ""Lena"" is not actually Lena.

The eyes at the very end, the glass of water,  both the way she drinks it - just like ""Kane"" did - and the way it appears to ""shimmer,"" the fact that she asks to see her ""husband"" (wouldn't the real Lena know that he was dead?), the fact that she doesn't respond affirmatively when clone Kane asks ""are you Lena?"", the fact that the clone Lena had the same tattoo on its arm in the lighthouse that ""Lena"" did in the interrogation chamber but that Lena does not appear to have a similar tattoo on her arm in the lighthouse, and the fact that she and ""Kane"" are still in isolation appears to imply to me that the scientists at the lab suspect that she isn't who she says she is, either.

They already established that electronics work in the shimmer, they just can't send out a signal because they get scrambled. So there is no reason a helicopter can't enter. Or if electronics don't work, how about a hot air balloon?

Here's the thing: If the entire conflict of the film hinges on the fact that the team must trek to the lighthouse through the forest on foot, then you have to give us a believable reason WHY. They spent no time setting up the central conflict of the film.

Also, before she enters the shimmer, Portman's character theorizes that Oscar Isaac is suffering from either radiation poisoning or a virus. And then she just walks into the shimmer with no protective suit at all?? Jesus fucking Christ, aren't these people supposed to be scientists??

The other girls take their rifles but Lena drops hers to try to save her or see what happened. To be fair they don't KNOW if something attacked her or if there are even mutated animals. Nobody saw what happened but Lena rushed. A lot  of these really feel like nitpicks tbh. The SD card was digital, it was up to date, it wasn't ""Why didn't this person take a video?"". It made sense to be left there, and why the marines recorded it. Given how little the movie already states about what's going on (to the point that execs had a problem) it seems more like pseudo-intellectual jerkoff that you felt condescended that they explained this stuff. They showed the bag but not what was inside it. EDIT: Especially given that you missed the entire point of the cheating subplot which was done with little dialog.

>Then they take a tower, but for some stupid reason they do security from a little booth with a light in it, and it’s on the ground. 

This is so that person could act as a canary. Like it or not, from the radio tower you aren't going to present much of a barrier to anything trying to get inside. Hell, with how fast that bear moved if someone had been up in the tower instead, they may all be dead.

They also do have a flashlight, which they use. I always just assumed off-screen they are double-checking the rooms. If you really want to nitpick, they talk of radiation yet nobody wears masks or carries a Geiger counter.
Also for your point about gear *they are not military, only Lena has military experience.* There is no reason the military would give them stuff like holo sights, gun mounted flashlights etc for people who are not trained to use them. The guns are simply as protection in case something happens.

The idea is that the shimmer is beyond our understanding; it may be alien, it may or may not be conscious, it may or may not know how it is affecting the existing consciousness on Earth.  So it's not evil, necessarily.  Its actions, however, are contrary to what the humans on earth want.  But the shimmer may not care, similar to how we might not care about the well-being of an anthill.

Also I don't remember the mission leader to develop a clone (I was extremely annoyed by the plot by this point so I may be wrong). I am absolutely baffled that instead of launching a boat (something without engine) towards the lighthouse, they use the most dangerous path even in normal circumstances, through a swamp. At the beginning of the movie there's the whole secrecy thing and yet they are inside a facility which was clearly built due to shimmer's appearence. You need thousand workers for such a complex. How they managed to keep the secret?

They don't keep a pen & paper written log or audio/video recording after they discover they all have amnesia on a regular basis?? In the end, the black swan gets a grenade and conveniently, that's the moment her conscience decides to destabilise the alien? C'mon! 

From what I gathered until then, the alien was creating a live interconnected environment while ""remixing"" everyting organic and also anorganic (the trees made out of silicone from sand). It would make total sense that a long enough fire (basically just another chemical reaction) to be included in the mix having the result of destroying everything. 
The same way the alien was mixing concrete with plants would make total sense to mix fire with the rest. So basically one would expect that the military would bomb the lighthouse and the resulting fire would finish the job. ... or a long enough camp fire would have been integrated in alien's ecosystem. 

One would expect that the entire trip to forge the main character, to define it and make it stronger but no, the entire trip is just a filler for the flashbacks which add almost nothing to building the main character.

So yes, I was so annoyed by the plot and complete lack of character development that I completely missed the soundtrack wich is simply awesome. /rant-over",7zqsdy

second, there was the water being pulled down from the sides of the glass, two dry spots gradually connected and separated the water near the lip of the glass and the main body of water. Idk how to better describe that. I think the significance is that she is like the water near the lip of the glass (the lighthouse was near the water, thus the water represents the alien/shimmer) and while the main body of water had separated (the alien died) a bit of it remained (in her, represented by the water near the lip of the glass).

The characters weren't developed and that was intentional; they didn't even have real names, so the focus was entirely on Area X. And it had a clear mysteries that the reader could wonder about rather than a vague idea of what would come at the end.

Many have compared it to a cancer or virus but for me it made me think about the difference between intelligence and consciousness.

I don't think she ever lies - eg. at the start when she's asked what happened to the other team members, she answers truthfully - Anya and Shepherd died (which they did, she saw their bodies) and when asked about Josie and Ventress just says ""I don't know"".... because, as a scientist, she *doesn't* know, there's no explanation for what happened to them. When ""Kane"" asks if she's Lena at the end, I took her silence to be honest - while she's the same individual who went into Area X, she's been so changed by her experience (physically and mentally) that she can't identify with who she was before the expedition.",7zqsdy

They did try to explain that they've tried every manner of entry possible with no luck. In the book the border extends as high as the end of our atmosphere and tops off, and goes nearly to the earths core. The perimeter came down like a fucking anvil and destroyed everything it touched. The entry point is one area 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall and takes hours to navigate. I'm not sure why the movie didn't elaborate on the nature of the barrier a bit more.

I agree about the dodgy writing since they try to paint these women as damaged goods with nothing to lose, but all they do throughout the movie is desperately fight for their survival. I just try to think of them as being immediately compromised mentally once they've entered.",7zqsdy

Even with the ""we've been here for days and don't remember"" you'd think the contingency would be to leave with any possible information so another (possibly more successful) expedition could be planned. How is scouting completely forgotten?

Also, why such a huge lack of basic equipment? They're outfitted for a back packing adventure plus some guns. No hunters tape for marking their way for future expeditions to find, no drops of information either. No laid out plans so HQ knows their route when they inevitably don't show up and send yet another team in.

It's the military, are there only 5 people they can send at any given time? Why not send a huge expedition party to better defend itself?

In the end when the debriefer gasps at the confirmation it was extraterrestrial, we get a sense of how invested they were. They send in different kinds of teams each time, and they hear absolutely nothing back, so they can't be sure how to adapt their strategy. And right now it's in an unpopulated area and is slow-growing, so it has posed very little risk of the kind that would make everyone insist it needed to be nuked immediately.

It's pretty clear they don't need hazmat suits. Those would only make sense for an initial poking around. The government could have determined from their perimeter operations that whatever was going on wasn't really chemical.

It's also pretty clear they can all use big guns, and the military approach hasn't been working. So do they need escorts? Maybe a reticence to use force will be a good thing. Maybe their scientific training will be more important. The point of this expedition is to try something different.

[I completely agree that Ventress being down on the ground with a light on was a beyond-stupid way to keep watch. Had she been up in the tower listening quietly and not drawing attention to herself, she could have completely avoided attracting that predator. But then again the whole point of her character is that she has cancer and wants to sort of give herself to the destruction. She even talks at length about how we're all self-destructive in some way. Her asking for trouble is completely believable. Later too, it becomes more apparent that the shimmer sort of reflects the characters themselves: Josie is at peace with becoming one with it, and accelerates her assimilation; our heroine wants to fight it and keeps herself more apart from it; and the creepy figures themselves mimic the characters. And what does Ventress' creepy doppelganger do when Lena finds it right after it has finished transforming in to her form? It claims the alien technology wants to annihilate everything before promptly melting in to a million sparks! Later at the facility Lena says the shimmer was both beautiful and terrible, a nightmare and a pleasant dream. So annihilation wasn't really accurate at all; it was only Ventress' point of view.](#spoiler)

Tying everyone up was irrational sure, but it was reasonable at that point, because they were all going a little crazy. That's kind of the point.

Going after the bear alone makes sense if you really feel it is your duty to go after your comrade but you don't want to endanger the others. Ideally you stick together, but if the others are unwilling to follow, then set a time limit for your return past which point they should leave, and do what you have to do. It's not ideal, but there isn't a clean solution here, and it advances the narrative for the characters to not follow military protocol to the letter.

Time loss did seem odd, but I got the sense they wake up most disoriented and gain back something as they become more alert. Though the dreamlike quality of reality obscures a lot, they do seem to remember things they need to remember, so it's not true amnesia. They just never really feel fully awake and unscrambled, and that has a cumulative effect, especially as they go deeper in.

I thought the horror was wicked. I was grossed out and thrilled. It reminded me of how I felt playing The Last Of Us. That's not meant to be the entire focus, but I find the horror aspects are heightened by how the rest of the premise pulled me in.

I dispute the notion that we need to feel closer to the characters. This isn't a TV series. You don't have time to dedicate to each one to learn their full histories. You really only need to feel fully attached to Lena, and you feel for the others because you're a decent human being who views them as people with legitimate stories even if you don't know those stories. All these characters are Argonauts. They're on an expedition, and that's what matters. Everyone who undertakes such ventures shares some common traits, and you're meant to simply understand the archetype.

[One thing that does bother me is Ventress said something to the effect of them sending boats, which was clearly a much faster way to reach the lighthouse, since the shimmer didn't seem to effect electrical or mechanical equipment, so nothing would have really gone wrong with motors or whatever to prevent them from making it. When Lena gets there we see the bones of many people lying around, so presumably our mariners lost their heads when they actually reached the lighthouse because of that freaky business in the basement. That all makes some sense, but the stated objective of the scientific mission was to get to the lighthouse as swiftly as possible, and even without knowledge of what happened to those previous teams, it's pretty obvious that the fastest way to something next to the water is by boat. So why did they go in over-land on foot? To remain quieter? Because they couldn't know boats were a superior idea a priori because they recieved no word from any team so far? Plausible.](#spoiler)

The second thing that bothers me is the push to keep going. It would be much more rational to go back and try to strategize with the new information you have than to keep pressing forward, so the next mission can be more successful. But you get a sense of why Ventress and Lena at least feel they must keep going, so I can't be that upset with them. They're just desperate.",7zqsdy

Idk why everyone's hating on the characters, way more character depth than every other scifi-death-trap movie I've seen. Less character arcs it's true, and they weren't multifaceted characters but they weren't meant to be. Movie was about Lena, after all.

It suggests there is no true 'annihilation,' only alteration.

Never mind the difficult logic issues (like no protective gear going in, tethered comms, and the abandoned watch tower party on the ground in front of a bright light), the whole mystique of the environment and how the characters would end up was practically ignored altogether and spoiled by Portman's character early on (respectively).

I get there's some pretty obvious symbolism in the demise of each character, in reference to their respective ""personalities/perspectives"", but the overall development of their characters was pretty abismal. Even Portman's character, though seemingly ""fleshed out"" a bit more, showed no real signs of change of growth by the end of the film (the ambiguous ending didn't help this, obvs).

Anyway. There's an overriding feeling of ""art and confusion for art and confusion's sake"" that I can't shake, no matter how shallow that opinion feels to me. Any artistic decisions in direction or writing felt like self-indulgent cruft.",7zqsdy
dv64g6i,"The cheating subplot was actually the entire purpose.  This is symbolic sci fi, my favorite kind.  In other words, it's a story that uses fantastical elements (the sci fi, in this case) to symbolize real world themes.  The theme of annihilation is self destruction, as it's actually heavily mentioned several times throughout the film, the things we inherently do to ourselves when our lives unravel.  The shimmer is self destruction.  We get repeated flashbacks while Portman is inside showing her real world self destruction.  If you remove the sci fi from this movie, those flashbacks aren't flashbacks, they're the present tense story.  The sci fi then serves as a visualization of her and Oscar Isaacs self destructing relationship.  When they both make it out of the shimmer, they're together but they're not the same people anymore (and within the sci fi story this is symbolized more literally by the alteration of their dna, the effect of the shimmer aka their self destruction/hardship).  The other female characters are going through similar transformations, but unlike Portman's character, they're not entering the shimmer to face themselves and save something, they're going in to die.  

Disregarding all that and looking at your other point as to why they sent in the people they did: it's explicitly stated why they sent in the kinds of people they did.  The doctor profiled them, deliberately found people who were in modes of self destruction who would willingly take on such a suicide mission.",7zqsdy

dv64l7z,"Yea, I was confused why they sent in a small team of scientists like that and expected results. I just kind of assumed it was a last ditch effort to get a good look at the source before the shimmer spread further. Also, I think it's a callback to the novel that this movie is loosely based on. 

As for the cheating subplot, we kind of see that uncomfortable sex scene with her coworker one too many times. But later Kane mentions he saw them at it and that's why he signed up for the dangerous and probably suicidal mission, which kicked off the whole thing. Also duality is a huge theme in the movie, so her affair sort of fits the bill.

dvt8ygb,"I think you're missing the point, the movie explores atmosphere, metaphor, emotion --

it's not a drama, it's not about characters and their ""arc"", it's not about some intricate plot

think of it more like watching a dream. It's symbolic mostly - but without being senseless allegory like the movie ""mother!"" was : what is depicted is supposedly an ""actual series of events"" - but the events aren't the point of it

the movie is about self-destruction, and it explores this theme through the use of the aesthetics of the Cosmic Horror genre - which focuses on humans facing the unknown, unknowable, incomprehensible - in the spirit of Lovecraft.

There's a possible interpretation of the film as an allegory for man's battle against cancer --- since it bears a lot of similarities to the alien - it's a non-sentient entity that nevertheless causes self-destruction in very complex and intricate ways.
But cancer itself can be seen as just another metaphor for the more general concept of self-destruction --- an ultimate physiological manifestation of it.

When people call movies ""artsy"" - this is kind of what they mean -- you need to think of this more as a piece of art rather than a traditional story - with a coherent ""beginning, middle and an end"" (even though some semblance of a story definitely exists here and stands at the core of this film).

It's primarily a journey of the mind.

Considering this, I think on some level the shimmer is a metaphor for cancer. Cancer itself is not truly evil, it has no malicious intent. It just comes out of nowhere and warps what God has made good and right. It destroys our lives and we invest so much time, energy, and resources on finding a cure for it, but the absurdity of it all is that cancer has no rhyme or reason or malicious intent. It just is.

Every single character was self destructing in some way. Kane found out about the affair and he told Ventress (his psychologist). Ventress had cancer. Anya was an alcoholic, Josie was depressed, Sheppard was grieving the death of her daughter. Lena is unfaithful and lies constantly throughout the film. The affair was important because Lena isn't supposed to be a likeable character. This is the theme of the movie. Self destruction and the cycle of life.

So at the end, it's pretty clear she doesn't tell Lomax what actually happens in the Shimmer. She confirms Sheppard's death, but says she doesn't know what happened to the rest when we know for a fact that she does. When she's questioned about the alien, she first tells him she doesn't know what it wanted, then when Lomax says it was destroying everything and mutating the environment, she almost defends it saying it wasn't destroying everything. It was changing everything, creating.

This is from the initial scene:

A single organism alone on planet Earth, perhaps alone in the universe. About four billion years ago... one became two, two became four

1. What the director knows about the past expeditions is more or less a mystery. If they tried to go for anything like the book, she was hiding just how many expeditions there had really been, hiding that she had cancer and didn't care if she came back, and who knows what else. She could have known that teams off all-male military personel entered and still ended uo killing each other, and she calls the shots at ultimately what is a pretty poorly run branch of the government even if they are overseeing alien anomaly.

2. You have to accept that the minute they entered Area-X their judgement was compromised, just like their DNA. We accept that Anya goes crazy because she is the most obvious, but the whole teams faculties are suspect. Kind of like how people with hypothermia are compelled to strip off their clothes even though it means their death. The team members are probably coming up with plans where to us it sounds illogical but to them it's like ""Guard alone on the ground instead of up high in the watchtower? Makes sense...""

dvm7w0e,"Hear what you are saying. MY take on it was that immediately upon entering the shimmer there is cross talk and diffusion of everything that enters. The DNA, Biology, is mutating and warping with everything. This is also happening with their minds. This is why they are disoriented, forgetting things, etc... Their thoughts and minds are diffusing into the environment. This explains how the girls voice ends up in the bear/creature. Part of her mind / voice were diffused into the beast killing her. 

The Shimmer puts everyone into a mental fog and they cant tell why their minds are cloudy. It was implied that it is because their minds and thoughts are literally leaking into the environment.",7zqsdy
dvln1i1,"The boat part made sense to me once they saw the crocodile thing, I wouldn't want to risk going into the water after that as well. The thing about them not having a sense of urgency and curiosity doesn't bother me either, it's heavily implied (and said by some of them) that the shimmer alters the mind as well as the body, can't be healthy for your brain to have constantly mutating cells. One of them even goes crazy tying the others to chairs.

The part that was the most wtf to me was how they venture into it in plain clothes, you'd think they'd have suits against radiations or hazmats given they have no idea what's beyond and people who go in don't come out.

dvlnwmc,"I agree that the film is a lot stronger in plot and visuals than on the character side, but I think the first one who died was also a well-developed character for the little time we saw her. And the psychologist's character made sense too. The other two weren't very well-developed, and I wish the movie had spent more time with them. Most of the time in the shimmer is things happening to them, not them doing things, which sort of fits the theme of cancer, but also makes for a less interesting film. ",7zqsdy
dvlijf7,"Yeah, I agree with your point about character development. It felt like a lot of the 'backstory' was unnecessary since I never really connected with any of the scientists. The actions and reactions of the team just didn't quite seem realistic enough. I read (And quite enjoyed) the book a while back and in that they started straight off within the shimmer rather than having all the quite boring and unnecessary backstory. When the reader is trying to make sense not just of the world they're in but also the characters in it it's a much more interesting story. I wish they'd stuck more to that format as that would have been a lot more engaging and interesting. I felt pretty bored for a lot of the movie, finding it neither scary or intriguing. I enjoyed the finale though and I wish they had had more of that dreamy unreality throughout the rest of the film.",7zqsdy

dvqgg24,"> She's part of this team researching this crazy alien phenomenon that could lead to the end of the world and she seems bored out of her mind and uninterested.

Think of it this way: she's working for a government agency tasked with studying Area X. She's profiled and sent in team after team of people, but nothing and no-one comes back. Repeat for *3 years*. Every approach they've tried to understand the phenomenon has failed, any hopes of stopping the expansion have long since died. She feels utterly powerless. One man finally returns (Kane) but he's unlike himself and on the brink of death.

She's given everything she has professionally and got nothing to show for it, sent dozens (possibly hundreds) of men to their death. She has no family or friends... and terminal cancer. She's at rock bottom. She's resigned herself to watching Area X continue expanding until it consumes the agency (and beyond) unless the cancer kills her first. She opts to join the next expedition hoping she might get some answers for herself, whilst knowing she will probably never return. She's not approaching the expedition with a spring in her step, kicking her heels - it's with an utterly depressed, hopeless resignation that she will die either way, and Area X will probably continue expanding regardless of what she or anyone else does.",7zqsdy

Glass is made of sand.
The Alien's ""refracting"" effect caused the sand to ""refract"" into glass in the shape of other things, in this case, trees. 

Perhaps there dead tree cells there, perhaps its ""copying"" the shape from more farther away environment, who knows?

It doesn't really matter.

The point is that different things combine in seemingly random ways.

For example, the way the shimmer affects the living things. Whilst plants and animals evolve/mutate (because they just exist and survive), the humans die, which I think has to do with the self destruction attitude that is mentioned. But since everyone had different ways of self destructing, that mutated in different ways.

That's another thing that adds beauty to the movie. It's not one clear message (like the traditional/cliche sci fi) it's open to interpretation",7zqsdy

dvoqk28,"I think a lot of these questions are open to interpretation, but this is how I saw it.

Despite knowing that his wife was cheating on him, I think Kane still had an inherent desire to see her again, at least very deep down. His original self didn't want to leave the shimmer because of how changed he was and realised that returning would be a danger to his wife/the world. Of course, that begs the question why he told his clone to look for his wife. 

Kane was the only member of his team to make it to the lighthouse, which is why he was copied. I think some of his inherent desires were copied into the clone as well; even though the clone was confused, it knew where Lena was and wondered at the end if he knew her (iirc). 

I don't know if any of the other expeditions made it to the lighthouse, but I think it's safe to assume that they didn't. 

I don't think the cloned entity has any particular desire to spread the virus, but might have an instinct to do so. Depending on if there's intelligence behind the 'thing' or not, it may have been designed to copy people and send them out into the populace to spread the shimmer.

Or it could have been an alien entity acting completely without purpose and on instinct. Just another method of self-preservation and evolution.

durkv8k,"Much much different than the book. With that said, I though Garland's interpretation was amazing. The ""hole"" in the lighthouse is a main focal point in the book and was referred to as the ""tower"". It was also not inside the lighthouse in the book, if i remember correctly. The Biologist's husband was also not alive when she went into the ""shimmer"". There were also no animal attacks, if I recall.

The whole movie I was thinking Lena and Kane together somehow was the solution to the shimmer. All the other characters went in with nothing pulling them back to the real world, while Lena had a strong desure to return to Kane, whether that be love or guilt or whatever.

I thought that Kane + Lena was similar to the ""1 + 1 = 3"" in that together they made something different which was also what the ""alien"" was doing. So apart they were self-destructive, but together they were more then the sum of themselves as individuals.",7zqsdy

I think this is a problem originating from the title of the book, because in the book, the word 'annihilation' has significant meaning that is wholly stripped from the movie.  In the book, according to the author, the locus point of the phenomenon is based off of a starfish called 'destroyer of worlds' which is large and consumes other starfish, and so 'annihilation'. The phenomenon IMHO was clearly malevolent, at least in the first book, so the title was apt. It is far less so in the movie adaptation.

In the movie, the word 'annihilation' describes what the psychologist (and only the psychologist) sees when she sees the shimmer, which is a likely reflection of her state of mind due to her terminal cancer.",7zqsdy
duy5sk2,I hope there is no explanation. Was that in the book? It works best as an unexplained phenomenon. ,7zqsdy
duy6mgu,In the book the psychologist was able to hypnotize each crew member.

duzmtkp,Helplessly Hoping - CSNY,7zqsdy
dv0p7kl,"I do not have any insight into what the production/writing team thought. I'm interpreting this as someone that works in the biological sciences.

Intense electromagnetic radiation breaks the bonds in DNA. Given that our DNA repair mechanisms aren't perfect, this eventually causes mutations. Perhaps the shimmer wasn't directly refracting DNA, this was simply a by-product of the EM radiation refraction. 

Moreover, the life within the shimmer seems to have made great use of [transposons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposable_element), genetic material that can move within and between genomes. This happens on our Earth often. For example, parts of the human genome originated in viruses. 

If the shimmer is an area of intense EM radiation, causing breaks in DNA, and is inhabited by life that has a high degree of transposons, which take advantage of DNA breaks, it seems to explain much of the activity within the shimmer.

Regarding your feelings of emotionless throughout the film, I think it just isn't your type of film. You're supposed to be pondering philosophical issues, not waiting for the next monster to appear. 

> Even Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac's characters were forgettable, other than the fact they really loved each other and read books together.

If this is what you thought after watching the film, you're completely off. Pretty much every scene between them, even the tickle scene, displays varying degrees of tension between the two. Isaac's character, for the most part, is distant. In the book reading scene you mention, it becomes apparent Isaac is aware of her infidelity. He gives her a sad stare, saying to her, ""hey."" His facial expressions are depressed and distant as he's likely waiting for a confession. On the day he departs, he didn't even kiss her goodbye. He just coldly walked away for his suicide mission. The film then cuts back to Portman's character as she's nearing the lighthouse. She screams as she thinks about him departing because she realizes he knows. She loves him, but the film's depiction of that love is more about guilt than it is about happiness. Her guilt is the reason she went into the shimmer in the first place. ",7zqsdy
dv56u3u,"I am a huge fan of the book and I think this is one of the best adaptations I have ever seen. 

As a filmmaker, I'm fascinated by what Alex Garland and James Vandermeer did with the movie. The writer was heavily involved, and they worked on it before the other books released (I think). Film and books are ultimately two completely different arts, that depends on different criteria to be effective. I really don't think the book, as it is, would work as a movie. There is far too much introspection, that would, in a movie, call for boring voice overs. Secondly you can't really convey that unseen horror in movies without showing the audience a bunch of darkness. 

I absolutely disagree with that carnal sin of horror. This is a overused trope, mostly originating from the fact that horror is hard to create, you need good artists, modelers etc. I admit I loved some parts of the book more than the movie, but it goes in the other way as well. The ending, or the last third of the movie is absolutely mind blowing, something that really improved on the book. It was a pure audio visual experience, where I didn't feel sober. This lack of sobriety was present in the book reading experience, but wasn't nearly as intense. 

The other differences you don't care about or don't like can just be attributed to the change of theme between the movie and the book. Again, Annihilation was completely in her POV. In a movie this would call for a way more intimate, smaller scale movie, that in the end wouldn't do justice to Area X. I want to see what it actually is, I want to see the creator's vision of a unknowable horror. That in combination with the absolutely genius sound design/soundtrack hybrid completely nailed what was most important about the book for me: the world and the atmosphere. The biologist was an interesting character, but ultimately I've seen these characters before. ",7zqsdy

2) Someone else might have to chime in here, but I don't remember getting any information one way or another on this.  What we learned with Lena's experience was that the psychologist became the light that became the clone. So presumably Kane would have had a few surviving members with him one of them became the light, one of them was filming.

3) When Lena fled from the hole she came back into the main area of the lighthouse her clone was already waiting for her. As if on top of all of this weirdness, teleportation is also in their tool belt.

dux4quw,My take on it was that the alien couldn't survive outside of the shimmer.  It seemed like when the alien replicated Kane it took part of Kane with it (likely the same with Lena).

This left him and Lena as fragments of who they were originally.,7zqsdy
dux5uv0,"This is just interpretation, but I think the doppelganger knew that Kane went into the shimmer due to Lena being unfaithful, so perhaps the clone teleported straight to their house and created a biological emergency to get her attention and see what she would do.  Would she allow their marriage to fully disintegrate?  Or would she do whatever she could to save him?  

She chose the latter, and thus saved whatever was left of their marriage, which is likely what Kane wanted (either that or nothing at all, apparently).

dvndxp1,"> . I think the literal 'kill it with fire' ending was perhaps a little disappointing (I would certainly have preferred the entire human race just accepting that they are going to merge with all living things) but admit that it was presented in a visually enjoyable way.

That certainly is one way to look at it. Personally, I prefer the 'kill it' ending.

I mean, maybe  Lena regrets destroying the Shimmer and the creature that created it, realizing that despite the government's fears it wasn't ""annihilating"" anything, merely changing it. But on the other hand, Ventress after reaching the lighthouse and being affected by whatever landed from space claims that the Shimmer would eventually destroy everything, since it endlessly mutates everything by reflecting everything's DNA upon each other endlessly, eventually breaking down everything into shapelessness, the titular Annihilation, so destroying it was probably the correct thing to do. We see multiple mutations within the movie that clearly weren't beneficial to the recipient such as the soldier whose innards turned into something alive and Josie becoming one of the human trees.

So yeah, count I'm more for ""if it's hostile, you kill it""",7zqsdy
dvnjnr1,">started asking why they didn't record every moment of their journey towards the lighthouse. It would have made so much more sense as a data-gathering expedition.

I think it was supposed to be a data gathering mission, but (unfortunately) the film didn't really show much of that happening. You see Shepherd taking samples just before the alligator attack, and of course Lena takes some swabs after she kills it and is doing blood tests throughout the film. Apart from that I think there's only one reference to data collection - when Anya argues with Ventress about going to the lighthouse or back to the border after Shepherd's taken by the bear - ""we have data, observations, photographs. She (Josie) has hella footage."" I could have done with a bit more ""sciencing"" since they are all scientists!

As for the ending - still thinking about it, but to me it was more than just the grenade and fire. A drop of Lena's blood goes into whatever entity Ventress turns into (or whatever entity had adopted her shape) and then it mimics Lena's behaviour. It takes the grenade from her. I think somehow her self-destructive tendency infected the entity - it doesn't seem in pain when it's on fire, it touches Kane's body then touches the mutation/texture/whatever it is on the wall of the lighthouse which then spreads to everything else, sees the destruction, then goes into the lair and sets that ablaze too. I think it's somehow killing itself from the inside out because of that self-destructiveness it adopted from Lena, rather than just from the fire itself.",7zqsdy

Considering his squad was comprised of special ops military members he had supposedly fought with before, and that the grenades appeared to be apart of their standard kit, it's unlikely anyone on his team would have never seen one before.

The ouroboros tattoo was originally on the guy who had his stomach cut open. A theory is that the shimmer was constantly changing everyone's cellular/gene structure and cross-pollinating everything with everything else. So the guys tattoo transferred to Lena and also it was seen on Anya. Why is the shimmer replicating aesthetic stuff like tattoos?

I can't answer every one of those, but in response to your last Spoiler tag: I actually appreciated Garland's reveal of this information early. It's an old technique that Alfred Hitchcock talked about.

Imagine a dinner scene. People are talking, eating, for five minutes, and then suddenly the room explodes. Shocking? Certainly. But ""shocking"" isn't always the *only* tone you want.
Now the same dinner scene, but at the beginning of the scene, you see the bomb under the table. Suddenly, those same dinner conversations are packed with tension, because you know that the bomb is fixing to go off, and these fools won't know what hit them. You lose some of the shock at the end of the scene, but you've gained suspenseful tension through audience anticipation.

I think that's what Garland was going for. Worked for me, anyway.",7zqsdy

> What did they eat anyway? I mean Lena says she doesn't remember eating. Is it possible that, if this is the real Lena, that she mutated in some way to the point where she didn't need nutrition? Could she be blatantly lying because she's actually an alien? Could she not understand the concept of eating because she's actually an alien?

In the book they eat and drink often...in the movie they make it purposefully nebulous.  She never actually eats or drinks anything.  

The questions you ask all depend upon how you interpreted the climax.

>I think that Kane's clone teleports from Area X or somewhere close outside of Area X to Lena's house and is obviously weakened. But why is he weakened?

I think it was possibly a ruse (a very convincing one) to see what Lena would do.  Would she try to save her marriage, or subject it to annihilation?

>he's healthy enough to infect Lena and turn her into another alien. 

In the movie they make it clear that time spent in the shimmer exacts a toll, that toll being that they slowly become part of the shimmer, like the guy whose guts were moving like tentacles.

>If Kane's clone can teleport, and if his clone does want to infect others, why doesn't he simply teleport outside of isolation?

Likely the Kane clone just wanted to do what Kane wanted to do.  Kane wanted to see Lena.  Kane wanted them to be happily married.

>Why the hell was the house they made camp in identical to Lena's house, or at the very least the staircase (because that's obviously the main point)?

The idea is that the shimmer was refracting people's thoughts memories and turning them into reality.  Probably the most poignant instance of this is the Tessa Thompson character turning into part of the landscape, why?  Because she wanted to.

>, it means that Ventress either never made it to the lighthouse, or made it, was killed/died and her clone departed elsewhere.

I don't think Ventress wanted to be cloned.  She had nothing to live for.  Kane lived for Lena, Lena lived for Kane, so the shimmer picked up on that and acted in a manner consistent with their wants and desires, same with Ventress.

Oscar Isaac lit himself on fire and the shimmer creature burned down its layer. How was the theme of self-destruction dropped when the resolution to the main conflicts of the film were organisms *literally* self-destructing? The only reason the shimmer goes away is because it literally self-destructs. 

I don't see where you got the idea of identity from. The clones were building on the motif of cancer cells dividing which also reinforces the the theme of self-destruction. 

EDIT: Natalie Portman was brought to Southern Reach a)because if they just kidnapped her husband there's no way to prevent her from going to the press and b)she just came into contact with Oscar Isaac which is likely cause for quarantine. She is ostensibly being held against her will for the sake of secrecy. Her volunteering for the mission was really her only option.

I do believe the ""alien"" hands the ""human"" the flash bang, just as it did to her boyfriend in the video. And it is in that moment that the ""real"" Lena realises that there is no escape, hence her empty facial expression, she realizes she has to be annihilated.

I personally think the switch happens when she hits the alien in the head with the tripod, there is a whiteout which probably symbolises a stop in her stream of consciousness, they both hit each other in the head.

EDIT: just thought of something else: there is also the thing going on where the alien mirrors everything, which basically means it does the exact opposite of what she does. She tries to push away from the door and the alien pushes into her as a reaction until she stops resisting and they both fall down. This ties into the title I believe: when matter and antimatter come into contact they annihilate but they are in essence completely the same. Maybe the door sequence is where the real Lena gets annihilated.",7zqsdy

In that scene that she checked her blood it could be determined that the shimmer has been affecting all of them already, so it would not necessarily mean that she is, indeed, a clone, like Kane. 

However, she is the only one who knew what happened in the lighthouse. As nothing remains of the lighthouse but ash, I would say it’s difficult to say for sure if it truly was Lena or if it was a clone.

this is evident by the simple fact that the clone sometimes marches forward when she steps backwards, even though a perfect mirroring of her actions should have led it to back away
(this is actually what she's probably trying to induce or test)

So - it's not an exact mirroring of everything, it seems like it's doing something that alternates between mirroring and inversal of action (i.e - when it receives the grenade it is doing the opposite of what she's doing - which is providing the grenade).

I think the ""explanation"" for it is that the clone gradually becomes ""human"", gradually gaining agency - so that it can eventually operate independently. 

All this - as a none-conscious process, but more like a gradual evolution of form

Even when the cloning is ""complete"" - it seems that the process doesn't fully copy everything (which is why the clone of Kane doesn't behave like him, have all his memories, etc.)

dvnpg4f,"I don't think memories really transfer all that well to Doppelgangers.

The movie is very Lovecraftian, so applying logic to it skips the most important point.

duqcyag,"It's interesting but for one significant reason I don't believe it.

One, as you said, we clearly *see* that Lena blows up the doppelgänger, but more importantly...

Lena gives the grenade to the doppelgänger, who has to this point attacked Lena and not let her leave, and the doppelgänger holds on to it and gives up. This was, at least for me, an extraordinary moment and I have a theory about this. I think once the doppelgänger became Lena, and saw all the emotional turmoil, self-hatred, etc that she possessed, the doppelgänger decided it didn't want to be human, and accepted death. I think that moment, whether or not I'm even correct about it, is too significant to be completely erased by what we were shown being incorrect.",7zqsdy
duqksr2,"I thought the same thing. In addition, you see when ""Lena"" shot the alien and climbed out of the tunnel, she saw the ""alien"" already outside the tunnel. For me this actually represents that this ""alien"" was Lena because although there's a ton of weird in the Shimmer, there was no teleportation or anything like that. Since what we see is actually representing what ""Lena"" told everyone during the interrogation, that scene has to be interpreted with this in mind and by extension, could be a lie or genuinely memory confusion due to the merging/duplication/whatever.

The first act ends with the cast entering the shimmer. The only ""setup"" was that nothing comes back from the shimmer. It's established that they are not all trained combat personnel. Literally none of these other criticisms are valid because no where is the team's training set up except that they are scientists and an EMT. The issues the group goes through are simply meant to reinforce the subtextual themes and their deaths are allegories for dying of cancer. 

The story was about a woman atoning for her guilt. The fact that she does this by going into the shimmer is merely a coincidence that gave the director artistic license to tell his story visually.  Lena is the only one the responds to dangerous situations competently so your comment that she acts untrained also makes no sense. 

>The movie feels like its going somewhere and then it just ends and switches to something else and at the end of the movie there is a completely new plot and nearly everything that happened before or up to that point was just filler and to explain the ending act.

In the book none of the characters have names, and they are not developed very much, since Area X itself is the main character. There isn't any of the tying people up in chairs and stuff like that which I agree felt very out of place in the film. The characters actually work together decently, which you would expect from a team that's being sent to explore an unknown area.

The book is also a constant ramp up of tension; there's a much more developed mystery in the middle which I won't spoil here, but it's very different from the movie and I personally liked it a lot more. I was actually looking forward to seeing it adapted into film, so I was pretty disappointed when I realized it was completely ignored.

I thought the movie was decent though. It seems like it was trying to capture the spirit of the book, but ultimately failed to achieve that completely.

Instead what we saw in the origin of the shutter was very ambiguous - it was almost as it wasn't an alien creature, but rather an alien ""law of nature"" that was introduced to earth's biology.

**That reminds me of Ex Machina, actually. Both films ask complex questions but aren’t as concerned with providing answers.**


Not explicitly.


**Many movies are afraid to take that approach. Why is it an approach you like, and what does it give an audience?**


To be honest, I think what it really gives the audience is… well, to an extent, I would hope it gives them respect. That they don’t need to be spoon-fed. But it also creates a requirement, which is that the film is not going to do everything. It is a sort of… the audience member is a participant in the narrative, and if the inferences are going to be understood, and the connections are going to be felt — even if they’re different inferences and different feelings — they are going to be brought by the audience member. It’s like you have to join the party. And so, I think the ideal audience member for a film like that, and other films like it, is one with an open mind who’s not there just to be entertained for two hours. There’s a two-way process they’re willing to engage in.",7zqsdy

dv5nz2d,"I think you should stick to science documentaries or something like that... they never actually established a ""logic"" for the place, so most of your points are moot. The only predictable thing about the area is that it is unpredictable. The psychologist's lines indicated that there were many trials, I wouldn't be surprised if they tried using vechnicles, ropes tied to people etc. Every single thing you mention there is explainable by the nature of the place. Also did you not catch that Area X, like with everything else, basically unravels people's minds? Saying ""why didn't charater x do this, it would be more logical"" falls in the face of a force that is constantly recalibrating your mind. 

For the other points that don't concern character motivations, decisions and seemingly missing technology, there's even less to hang on to. ""destroying the lighthouse should have not have"", ""this would make sense if it was hive bla bla"". Where did you exactly get the information for this? We don't know anything about the alien. We don't even know if it was an alien. The guy basically leads her on ""so it's an alien?"" and she answers yes with very little confidence. Either way this things logic is different than your logic.

Same for the psychologist's transformation. this one is explained in the movie. Everything is changed, ""mutated"", refracted. Organic life, inorganic elements, energy etc. These distortions become stronger the closer you are to the lighthouse, where absolutely everything is distorted, including gravity. 

Oh also forgot your second point, that the [affair](#spoiler) is unnecessary. Um, it's kind of the whole motivation for Lena's character to go into the Shimmer.

Seems like the obvious step that they missed but I fault the books for that logical misstep, not the movie. Also, electronic equipment *did* work inside, that was the point. They had that huge plot point about how all electronics work, it's just that the shimmer ""refracts"" everything, so signals coming into the shimmer or leaving it were scrambled. 
*  Yeah another solid criticism of the logic of the film. I would say that I saw this movie twice, and I really appreciated it more the second time because I tried to let that stuff go. I found that if you thought of the movie more as a thought experiment and less as a hard sci-fi thriller, it worked a lot better. ",7zqsdy

My immediate reaction was, go back out, tied a long rope around yourselves, and go back in. Didn't they have any reconnaissance reports for the years it was there? No robotic probes? No electronic equipment works inside? But they could watch videos on a digital camera? Also, radios and cell phones aren't the only way to communicate to the outside world. 

So much this.

Bring a shielded tether for fuck sake, do some recon that way. 

No electronic communication works but they couldn't run a boat inside and get a look at the lighthouse? A helicopter? Nothing?

You don't see the women eat much while they're in there. I'm guessing mutations are cause appetite suppression or something. Fauna is just exploding and everything is changing. Seems reasonable to assume consumption of food is lower than normal in the shimmer. ",7zqsdy

I believe the shimmer is some sort of multidimensional entity that doesn't understand life and learns as it goes.

I think it was kind of a mockingbird type of predatory strategy. Also that bear seemed to be completely blind , and the hearing and sense of smell weren't so acute (it couldn't hear the three ladies tied to chairs, or smell them well, or lena whispering ""don't react now""). In that situation, probably it made sense to ""evolve"" this mocking sounds strategy. Maybe an experiment the shimmer did and didn't know where it was going halfway through, who knows. As I said, I don't believe the shimmer had any plan or knew what it was doing. I believe it just wanted to understand somehow like ""oh look , this is quite different from a bunch of asteroids in space or a nebula"" , and it stayed there. Or maybe just was being there and I'm anthropomorphizing. ",7zqsdy
dwk85kx,"Replied this elsewhere but it fits along with what you are saying. 

I agree and I think half the reason the bear would tear out the throat is as the  minds meld you would eventually realize you were eating yourself and listening yourself scream so you'd tear out your own throat to silence it.  Then stop eating the rest of your body because well you're eating yourself. ",7zqsdy

So I think it developed a body structure that essentially was a copy of Shepard's vocal cords during a scream. So when air was forced through its throat, or in certain ways, it would also pass through the adapted structure and create the sound of Shepard screaming. The new structure may have had some basic reflexes that helped create the sound as well. I really don't think it was intentional on the poor bear's part. ",7zqsdy

Wait, so you actually think that she made it out of the shimmer?

This would partly explain how she ended up with the lesbian characters (sorry, I've forgotten her name) tattoo on her forearm. I don't think that was the real Lena at the end, not at all. I don't know how to explain it yet, but I'm almost certain that wasn't her. ",7zqsdy

Then there's the house which not only is laid out exactly like the original, but so are the shots yet again no one addresses it explicitly. 

The meaning behind the tattoo is pretty clear but the house I think is less so. We don't need it for Anya to go mental on Lena because there's already the clear shot of him on the first video and her locket, so it must serve another purpose.",7zqsdy
duro3vp,It may have something to do with both loss of memory and the fact that the shimmer refracted more than just light and radio waves but also memories of those who enter the shimmer.,7zqsdy

When Lena asks Kane’s Doppleganger if he’s Kane he says, “I don’t know” and asks “are you Lena”, to which we never hear her answer. 

Maybe this was intended to make the ending thought provoking or open ended, but I could see the interpretation being that she didn’t answer because SHE COULDNT RELATE. She was still the same Lena, but Kane had changed. 

She fought to get back something she loved, and realized in that moment that because of her actions, the man she loved would never be the same man she had loved. ",7zqsdy
dvjnv6u,"That was definitely an interesting part of the movie. I like what some other commenters have pointed out about Carl Jung's shadow theory and the three different results achieved by Ventress, Kane, and Lina. And so the other characters were freed a bit from that framework and seem to just embody different reactions to the transformative and alien environment of the shimmer.

In that context, Josie's response to me felt like a rejection of her world/life and a radical acceptance of this ""other"", alien version. She was someone who clearly had suffered with reconciling herself with the world, and welcomed the chance to just melt away into this alternative mode of being once she came to understand what it offered. The plants growing from her scars were extremely symbolic.

There's also the possibility many of these interpretations are different ways of getting to the same truth, if one believes that truth exists.

Or just in a more simple and literal sense, the shimmer was destroyed because phosphorus is dangerous to the alien and Lena was lucky enough to have actually killed it, and by accidental continuation, the shimmer too.

duqemfn,"100% definitely read the first book, though I think it's important to say that Garland changed/simplified a lot making this adaptation.

Comparing just the first book to the movie, I think the movie does more to explain what's going on in its story than the book does in its own.  

The second book does present more information that I think helps understand the events of the movie and the first book. But to me, the first book is a patient experiencing an illness/dying, and the second feels like a doctor rattling off the physical findings of an autopsy. You'll get a broader picture that helps contextualize things in the first book but it just leads to more questions (like the patient saying they feel like they're drowning and the doctor finding that their lung were filling with fluid which then leads to the question ""why did their lungs fill with fluid?"")

I haven't finished the third book yet, but from what I've read from people that have it leaves you asking more questions and doesn't really give you satisfying answers.

duqxspq,"I didn't like that none of them except Lena had combat training. The military knows that soldiers don't make it out alive because something might be hunting them, so they send in a bunch of civilians with nothing more than M4s and well wishes?

dur2pmm,"(Out of habit I use some slightly different names that were changed in the movie: the facility they're at = Southern Reach. The anomalous place they call ""the Shimmer"" = Area X)

1)So this is something that the second book goes into a lot more and they kinda touch on it for a moment in the movie. I think it would have been too much to throw all of it in for the movie at the current length but Garland ""forced"" that thought when he spent as much time on the Southern Reach as he did (something that is left until the second book) so I think it's something they could have done for the sale of addressing it but ultimately unimportant. Things that go in, rarely ( if ever) come out. They can't just ""put a camera on a stick"" because that barrier they walk through makes no sense. What little info they have on it is contradictory: it's a tunnel and also wide open, straight and also winding, the time it takes to cross is anywhere between 3 and 10 hours etc. Area X essentially exists in its own dimension and no matter what the Southern Reach do they can't seem to affect it. 

2)It's funny because I think the point if the ""explanation"" was to make you think, ""wait that doesn't really make much sense."" To me it was an attempt at rationalizing/explaining something beyond comprehension. They're scientists so they're trying to fit what's going on into ideas that are familiar; our brains love patterns. But this is something so wholly alien that it's ludicrous to even think that we can adequately explain it with human terms.

3)I don't think it served no purpose though I totally understand where you're coming from (in the moment I didn't really like her either). I remember listening to a podcast where they talk about one of the troubles with short form (movie) storytelling that you don't have with long form (books/TV shows): you spend so little time with the characters that they can't really contradict themselves or go through subtle changes.

There's as much a psychological change within Area X as there is a physical one and Anya basically steamrolls though the concept of trying to reject and resist it. At the same time that chair scene also calls attention to idea that Lena (our narrator and only window into Area X) may not be reliable. 

I think they could have been slower burn on both those ideas but I think it was a limitation of the movie being 2 hours long and not 3 or 4 hours.

4)I think it's supposed to be like that, though I think that it isn't as clear as it appeared. Like I said earlier, there are a lot of hints that Lena isn't a reliable narrator, something that is given much more weight in the books. With regards to the Lighthouse, I don't think what she said happened is entirely what happened. I think that she changed Area X as much as it changed her (or the others). In the end she didn't kill it ( I don't think death was even a concept to it) but taught it what death is to humans. In doing so, Lena and Kane at the end are two cancerous cells that have effectively evaded chemotherapy and can start spreading unchecked.


But this is all just my thoughts based on what I've read so far of the trilogy and how deliberate I think Garland was with some of the choices. By no means a perfect movie but I think there is a lot going on that will take multiple watchings to unpack",7zqsdy
dutvc8j,"It definitely had some weak elements.  To me a lot of the weaker elements reminded me a bit of some similar problems I had with Alien: Covenant (which I also loved btw).  It's interesting though how here, a lot of those flaws are being overlooked and in Covenant they were nitpicked to death.    
  
Overall I really liked this movie though.  I have a theory that the Kane-alien left the shimmer and went to Lena in order to draw her back to the shimmer in order to replicate her as well and eventually procreate.   I also suspect that Ventress' cancer was accelerated in the shimmer.  ",7zqsdy
dzv7jk9,"Hox genes.  That was a bit sloppy.  They shouldn't have been so specific there.

Hox genes basically handle body planning, but if you give human hox genes to a plant it's not going to do what happened in that movie.  

If I were a betting man, I would say it would result in a plant not being viable (it wouldn't make it past early embryonic stages.). Hox genes code for transcription factors.  Those are proteins that bind specific DNA sequences.  The plant would have to have all of those specific sequences.  So yeah, not happening.

They should have just left it at ""these plants have human DNA sequences"" at most.  Let the viewer fill in the gaps.  Maybe humans turned into the plants from having their genetic code re-written/altered?  Maybe the plants got altered to be more human-like?  

Let the viewer's imagination run wild with all kinds of horrible scenarios.  ",7zqsdy
dur3hkn,"The fire was assimilated/transferred into everything, much like how the Tattoo transferred between people. 

I think the affair was to help establish that Lena is selfish, lies and just as self-destructive as the rest.

It didn't force her up against the door, it mimicked her trying to leave through the door but the door was closed so she hit it (and thus it hit her). I don't know why it kept pressing up against her after she stopped, maybe it had to do with actually being in contact with her? 

There's no explanation.

 It may have been a side effect of crossing the border or part of the idea that people need to be hypnotized in order to cross the border (something that is in the book but I didn't see much evidence of in the movie, though there were a few scenes that I need to rewatch because there may have been something).

So this last part, I think is twofold: One, there is as much a psychological aspect of the changes as there is a physical.  I think they were mentally compromised and thus unable to be rational or make good judgement calls. Two, I think the idea of intentional self-destruction plays a role. Just like Kane essentially sabotaged his happy marriage for no rational reason, the Expedition was sabotaging itself. I think it does so over several scenes but that part was the most blatant.",7zqsdy

dvsw4j0,"I'm glad you liked it. It’s difficult to discuss a lot of the other interesting aspects of the books without completely spoiling them for people who might want to read them (everyone should!). I’ll try my best, though.

&nbsp;

**1) Hypnosis**

In the books, Area X has been in existence for over 30 years, so the Southern Reach has had a lot more time to study it. The majority of the expeditions sent in were lost, but some of them were able to make it out by navigating back to the point where they appeared inside Area X and then approaching it at precisely the right angle (the gateways on both sides of the Area X border are invisible unless you face them head-on). Based on the information it learned from the successful expeditions, the Southern Reach was able to develop a few techniques to help protect future teams. The most prominent one is rigorous hypnotic conditioning of a sort that is far more invasive than conventional hypnotherapy. In one of the books, when describing a previous expedition member, it says that:

>[She] has been placed on a regimen of psychotropic drugs. She has been operated on, reconditioned, broken down, brainwashed, fed false information that runs counter to her own safety, built back up again, and all of this she has on some level known about, volunteered for.

The conditioning is done in part to protect the expedition members from some the more horrific sights in Area X. So for example, here's how a hypnotically conditioned character describes the  base of the “tower” (which is basically a lighthouse that has been flipped upside down and driven into the ground like a stake): 

>…a circular block of some grayish stone seeming to mix cement and ground-up seashells. It measured roughly sixty feet in diameter, this circular block, and was raised from ground level by about eight inches. Nothing had been etched into or written on its surface that could in any way reveal its purpose or the identity of its makers. Starting at due north, a rectangular opening set into the surface of the block revealed stairs spiraling down into darkness.

And here is how a non-conditioned character sees it:

>Once there, [she knew] immediately the tower isn’t made of stone… The tower is breathing. There is no ambiguity about it: The flesh of the circular top of the anomaly rises and falls with the regular rhythm of a person deep in sleep… The opening leading into darkness resembles a maw more than a passageway… The stairs form a curling snarl of crooked teeth, the air expelled smelling of thick rot.


The hypnotic conditioning also makes the expedition members suggestible to certain command words and phrases spoken by the psychologist (her character is much more menacing in the first book than she is in the film). Significant chunks of the books are devoted to various characters figuring out the extent to which they have been manipulated by their superiors. 

&nbsp;

**2) The Writing on the Walls**

As they descend the steps into the tower it becomes clear that the stone/flesh walls are covered in phosphorescent moss spelling out cryptic phrases. They have a memorizing quality to them, making it difficult to resist going deeper into the tower. As the biologist describes it:

>If I’d had the impulse to touch the words on the wall, I would not have been able to stop myself… [I had to] fight the compulsion to keep reading, to descend into the greater darkness and keep descending until I had read all there was to read. Already those initial phrases were infiltrating my mind in unexpected ways, finding fertile ground.

&nbsp;

**3) The Crawler**

Further down in the tower is the apparent the source of the writing: a slow-moving entity known as the crawler. While the crawler isn’t overtly hostile, it’s clear that things went very badly for an expedition member who’d recently tried to get a sample of it:

>[She was] slumped against the left-hand wall, her hands in her lap, her head down as if in prayer, something green spilling out from her mouth. Her clothing seemed oddly fuzzy, indistinct. A faint golden glow arose from her body, almost imperceptible... There wasn’t much left of her face, and odd burn marks were all over the remaining skin. Spilling out from her broken jaw, which looked as though someone had wrenched it open in a single act of brutality, was a torrent of green ash that sat on her chest in a mound. Her hands, palms up in her lap, had no skin left on them, only a kind of gauzy filament and more burn marks. Her legs seemed fused together and half-melted, one boot missing and one flung against the wall.

&nbsp;

As I said in my previous post, I get why the director decided to leave these aspects out of the film, since they probably wouldn't have translated very well to the big screen.

dw01aqd,"The film is based on the first book, which is the story of the all-female expedition into Area X. The film's ending is completely different from the book's ending.

The second book takes place after the events of first book, and takes place mostly at the Southern Reach facility.

The third book has three separate character threads and takes place both before and after the events of the first two books. It is set both inside and outside of Area X.

>The film ends in a familiar mirroring of Garland’s last film, Ex Machina, this time with two not-quite-humans venturing back into society together. But while Ava the android’s journey feels like a chilling triumph over the cowardly men who created her, Annihilation’s coda feels much more fraught, and more personal. Kane and Lena — or their shimmery doubles — have both destroyed a part of themselves in order to keep their DNA in the world, and it doesn’t feel very triumphant. (I am told by my colleagues that in addition to their altered physicality, as evidenced by their eyes, we also see the water on Lena’s glass mutate as she holds it during her interrogation. If I missed this on the big screen, I pity those poor international viewers trying to spot that on Netflix.) Maybe the Shimmer doesn’t need to exist anymore because it has two toxic agents in the form of Kane and Lena, a couple whose entanglement, both with themselves and their doubles, have left them shells of themselves, their sense of selves permanently dislodged. Lena, like her double, mirrored her husband’s journey because it was the only thing that made sense for her to do in her grief over their split.

It was worst for me when I was watching and Lena first entered the lighthouse. The camera pans around the room and passes over the pitch black hole surrounded by the bleach white of the lighthouse, and then the scorched figure to the left.

duskuhz,"Here's my take: it was an artificial intelligence, sent out into space to find alien worlds and study them. It landed on Earth and began studying this alien form of life, trying to understand DNA by cutting and splicing it.

It made a pseudo-Kane, and sent it back to his wife… but she wasn’t buying it. The duplicate wasn’t good enough, so the AI hit the “self-destruct” button on pseudo-Kane.

When Lena put the grenade in its hand, it finally understood. It knew what the grenade meant, and it finally grasped what these aliens were saying… they saw it as a threat to be destroyed. If it wanted to keep studying life on this planet, it would have to change tactics… or else they would destroy themselves the way Kane had done.

So it shut down the whole experiment — the Shimmer, the pseudo-Lena, everything — and transferred it’s AI into pseudo-Kane and altered Lena to be the same. Now it can continue to study life on this world from the point of view of humanity.

That’s my hot take on what happened. I just got home from the theater.",7zqsdy

We have pre-programmed self-destructive behaviors that we ""just do"" or ""just get afflicted with"" like aging, cancer, behavior problems that hurt us. Her meeting that creature was her splitting in two, like it happened with her husband. They got an opportunity to confront the destructive side of themselves in physical form. They come back from it, and I assume learn from the experience. They're changed people - mentally and physically. It's a metaphor.

So in the end I don't really think it matters if it's the ""real"" her or not. It's still her.",7zqsdy

dutcrbo,"Yup.  I actually loved that they kept the sense of uncertainty about the alien.  Vandermeer makes a point in the books that the alien is basically unknown, too powerful to stop and potentially unconcerned with us.  A lot of the books center on the helplessness of the Southern Reach organization, and that's shown in the movie a bit.

The director basically knows nothing about the shimmer, other than that it's growing.  The expeditions get no data out, and they're just changing variables to give the appearance of progress.  First they try a team of all-men, all-military; then they try a team of all-women, all-scientists; but they have no theory for why that might stop the shimmer's advance.  They don't even know what the shimmer is, they only have a handful of theories.  For all the power and influence of the Southern Reach, they are just throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks.

The alien isn't necessarily good, or evil; it might not care about the people at all.  It might not know that people exist.  In the books, they frequently toy with the idea that [the shimmer is a dumb machine made by a smart species beyond our understanding, possibly extinct or past the point of caring about the machine](#spoiler).  Basically, we're ants trying to stop an elephant from crushing our anthill.  Even if we fully understood the danger, how would we learn to communicate in time?

The movies ends a bit differently than the book, but humanity is basically saved by luck.  None of the preparations of the Southern Reach matter that much, in the end.  Lena makes it unscathed to the lighthouse and improvises in an attempt to kill her copy (or original? [Book Lena references that she is a copy that has been put back together by the alien, and the original gets assimilated into the shimmer.](#spoiler))  She couldn't have known that was sufficient to kill the shimmer.

This is why she fights back against the creature, who I think in some ways is a stand-in for God. She has a purpose. She doesn’t want to be annihilated, though part of her is anyway.  It’s partly about man’s attempt to thwart the powers that be, the powers that destroy us, the fundamental nature of everything. We assume our importance because we are conscious of our existence. When we discover that we are just a temporary arrangement of fragments, do we give ourselves up to the infinite, or do we cling to ourselves? ",7zqsdy

We are not afraid to rip our pasts to shreds if it gives us a chance to move forward, and we can see this throughout history in a large-scale societal level as well as the individual level. No other organism on this planet can do this and imo this is the beauty of creation.

The shimmer is a metaphor for human potential and creativity. But it is also a metaphor for human destruction and rigidness. One can’t exist without the other, and in fact there is a real world metaphysical basis for this: we as humans are essentially entropy machines which create order (buildings, cars, societies) from energy (fossil fuels, food, inspiration).",7zqsdy

Because it's not obvious that they did. Expecting others to write the story for the movie in their head is an example of you making up for bad writing by blindly defending it.

>Are YOU so dimwitted that you need a scene of a Helicopter crashing into the shimmer and not being admitted? Do you really need to see a scene that a Humvee won't penetrate? Do you really need this much exposition?

Oddly enough, I don't recall asking for entire scenes dedicated to these sorts of things, simply exposition. Why, exactly, wouldn't a vehicle working on a combustion engine be unable to penetrate the shimmer if it seems to only disrupt light waves as was explained in the movie? Unfortunately I can't really say as this was never even off-handedly explained. You're argument is simultaneously ""turn your brain off"" and ""make up explanations yourself"". Insulting my intelligence because the movie has plot holes is rather ludicrous.

>God help you if you try to watch 2001!

Yeah, I've watched 2001: A Space Odyssey multiple times. Quite capable of enjoying it because Kubrick excelled in making stories that are meant to be interpreted. This isn't the same as a plot hole, because interpretation is what the writers meant for you to do. 

An example of a *plot hole* in 2001 would be that HAL was meant to be superior to humans in every way, yet somehow Dave was able to thwart him and his vastly superior intellect. That doesn't make the movie itself bad, it's just a plot hole. Dave was supposed to triumph over HAL because it was representative of humanity triumphing over its creation.

However, it's important to note that plot holes can have different weight. The hero overcoming impossible odds can be explained by in-universe evidence, such as HAL seemingly becoming emotional and irrational at times as he gained sentience. This isn't simply assumption, this is a possible explanation that *the movie itself* has given us. This doesn't necessarily patch the plot hole, but it certainly can be a good enough explanation to band-aid the hole enough to barely notice it's there.

There is no in-universe explanation or evidence given to us as to why five female scientists need to approach the lighthouse on foot through dense foliage when they could have simply taken a truck. According to the physicist and other exposition, the shimmer disrupts light waves and does something fantastical to DNA. A combustion engine doesn't run on light waves, it doesn't need radio or satellite, older full mechanical models have no computers to speak of for the shimmer to disrupt. 

Why then, using only in-movie evidence and exposition, was the military unable to drive a vehicle along the beach to the lighthouse? We don't know. There is no real explanation. It's a plot hole.

>Let's ASSUME that they have tried all of the above and it doesn't work, ok? Much easier than screaming PLOT HOLE like a parrot.

It's difficult to assume what happened in a universe where the only thing they explained about the shimmer was its ability to disrupt light waves thus making radio and satellite useless. Cameras and other electrical devices worked within the shimmer, yet somehow I need to assume a reason as to why a vehicle, especially an older model, would not. This is a plot hole. 

I'm not screaming, I'm not parroting, I'm quite literally pointing out a few plot holes. I came here directly after watching the movie alone and posted this without going through what others thought first as my honest thoughts. Considering the plot of the movie consisted of five female scientists entering the shimmer on foot, reasons as to why they had no other choice but to do that are important plot points. The lack of explanations I can derive from in-universe exposition or evidence makes these issues ***plot holes*** by definition.

You've provided no possible explanation to cover said hole, you've only called me dimwitted and asked that I give the movie the benefit of the doubt when it comes to plot holes. It's rather ironic that you name me a parrot when the best defense you can raise for the movie is a tired and often repeated spiel that ardent defenders of movies they personally enjoy pull out as if their tastes were personally being attacked.

Please understand that I liked the movie, plot holes just take away from my overall enjoyment. You can ***assume*** what happened all you like, with what the movie itself has given me, I have no in-universe way of patching the obvious plot holes.",7zqsdy

My point being that Oscar Isaac knew he was pretty much fucked so I assumed he'd do something like punch himself in the face or some varying degree of self harm. He took it a notch further and killed himself. Now the precedent has been set that when white phosphorous is present, you're meant to hold it and blow up. He knew he wouldn't survive individually but the amalgam of knowledge that thing has runs off of copying (like the cell), not off some Darwinian survival or self preservation. So the next time the WP is present, Natalie Portman can safely give it to the thing and it feels right for it to stand there and blow up.",7zqsdy

Kane loves Lena so much that he allows a new version of himself to return - a version without memory or knowledge of her cheating. He sacrifices himself for love.

One more idea popped in my head: Ventress and Lena both say the Alien didn’t want anything — it just is.  I think that’s an allegory, too. When traumatic things happen to people we often search for a deeper meaning — everything happens for a reason, it’s all part of God’s plan, etc.  But the message here, delivered through the alien as metaphor, is that the alien — the traumatic experience — doesn’t want anything. It just happens, there’s no rhyme or reason behind why. Life is random, and we must find a way to overcome it anyway. ",7zqsdy

e3ocghd,">don't ever become a director unless it's true stories. Your movies would far too logical

I believe this is a common misconception. Things don't have to be *real* to make sense, they only have to follow logically from the premise of the story.

Take V for Vendetta as an example. Premise: the United Kingdom has fallen under a dictatorship, they carried out >!human experimentation on political prisoners, but by a twist of fate one of their experiments, a very bright man enhanced by their concoctions, manages to escape and seeks revenge!<. Everything after that follows perfectly. It's what you would expect to see in that world.

Or Jumanji. Premise: a magical tabletop game with an African jungle theme has the ability to manifest the consequences of your dice rolls. These manifestations are not really real, they are a mean for the game to do something, arguably letting the players become more mature. Everything that follows makes perfect sense given the premises.

Children of men: Suddenly the human race stops being able to conceive babies. All that results is what you would honestly expect to see in that situation. Monsters Inc.: boogiemen are actually real, they live on the other side of your the closet door, and they power their toasters with condensed children screams. The Lego Movie: everything and everyone is made out of Lego, and \*the only limit is your imagination!\*^(©).

In all these examples, the rules were set at the start of the story, and everything that happened afterwards happened within those constraints. If anything, the fault of whoever wrote annihilation wasn't that the movie wasn't real, it was that it was *too* real. Because if you set your story in the real world, aliens excepted, you're bound by real-world plausibility, and the real world has very precise and well known rules.

>This movie is meant to be strange, mysterious, not make enough sense to make you think.

duq5y7i,"In the book, the expedition members are put under hypnosis by the psychologist (yes, she hypnotized herself too). She's able to induce the others into doing what she wants by uttering specially-crafted key phrases.

Near the beginning, the biologist is exposed to spores which are how she begins her mutation (the other characters do not undergo any transformation). A side-effect is that she is no longer affected by the psychologist's hypnosis, so she quickly catches on to what's happening. The hypnosis is used as a plot device a few more times throughout the book. (Lemme know if you want spoilers.)

In the movie, the only hint we get of this is when they wake up that ""first day"" and can't remember how they got across the border or set up camp. I suppose we can infer that the psychologist used hypnosis here, as she did in the book. The difference is that the hypnosis is non-antagonistic; it's used to protect the expedition members as they cross from their regular world into the Shimmer. Perhaps the transition is too much for people to regularly handle, or perhaps it causes people to freak out too much, I dunno.

It's still rough for me, and feel I might be contradicting some earlier claims I've made, but I think I'm getting closer.

I think this personality shortcoming, the writer gives us in an easily digestible form. Kane is a life long soldier--someone who takes orders. Lena was one, and still is, but has become a scientist **as well.** She's more.

This makes me want to spin off into the struggle with the ""animal instinct"" prior to the lighthouse, and why the embodiment of the soldier is important, but I'll just stop myself there. ",7zqsdy

e0rivf5,"I don’t think you’re wrong in that they were combining in some way, but DNA wouldn’t bring the tattoo. This was a bit frustrating to me because the movie pretty much exclusively focused on DNA being refracted, when it would have to be much more than just the DNA. They went this route to amplify the biological narrative about cells dividing and stuff, but I feel like they could have made room to play with the idea of other things refracting more. Have the laws of physics being refracted, have them walking on the walls inside the lighthouse, I don’t know. Seems like a bit of a missed opportunity that they touched on with stuff like the glass trees coming out of the sand and the radio signals and compasses being refracted, but I’m not a writer so I’m sure they had great reasoning for keeping it the way it was.

Yea, when clone-Lena is set on fire, there is enough Lena in it so that it walks over to the corpse of Kane before climbing back down in the hole. The clone would have no reason to do that if it didn't have Lena's memories. ",7zqsdy
dv5r6ey,"I think it was more that she transferred her self-destructive tendencies to her clone, (which were expressed in the form of her affair) which is why it burned up when the grenade went off; it went throughout the lighthouse burning everything, literally annihilating itself.",7zqsdy

dv63nfh,"Everything in the shimmer was truly ""alien"". Alien in the fact that they had zero knowledge of what was happening. Science itself was upended according to their understanding of it. For me the representation of the shimmer, and how alien everything really was, was the scariest part. The unknown. Not knowing if there was intent behind everything, or if it was just a random force of nature, one we're unfamiliar with. The not knowing was the truly scary part for me.

But in regards to the movie, I'm mainly talking about the fact that every beam of light is a rainbow that flares beautifully, the moving fingerprints and corner of your eye things like that, and the last 20 minutes as a whole; especially how the music almost defines the movement of the entity. The philosophical idea of the movie is a completely different acid trip I'm still trying to piece together. Kane says something about his mind being completely open and that's what any psychonaut will tell you acid does.",7zqsdy
dvptqyd,"Good points. Also important to mention we see bio luminescence, in some scenes, meaning there's jelly fish dna in the eco-system. So along with the shark teeth so for all we know there aren't just sharkodiles, there could also be jellysharks with teeth covered tentacles. ",7zqsdy

Totally fair. But then it’s just one more inscrutable element in a film composed of nothing but. I am left to assume this movie is, above all else, concerned with exploring the relationship between Lena and Cane, and all of the other weird elements are symbolic devices. But man oh man their relationship just did not pop for me, and I’m still left feeling like there’s little clear message to draw from there. People rub off on each other? People change? Once things are muddied up it’s impossible to un-muddy them? Still seems like a scattershot attempt at saying whatever it’s trying to say. ",7zqsdy
dv9q2bv,"Thanks for your thoughtful reply. Another user suggested the same interpretation, and I really like it out of context. A non-sentient alien force, as purposeless as it is powerful, is a great concept with tons of thematic potential. The problem is that, to my eye, *nothing* else in the film resonates with this. There is no deep exploration of humanity's attempts to ascribe meaning to meaningless... the struggle between blind nature and human invention. Instead the film seems to center around Lena and Cane's relationship, even briefly shoehorning an affair into the mix. I think I was looking for a ""motivation"" to the aliens because I was grasping for anything that unifies this movie's many weird, disconnected elements. I'm still left feeling like there is a much better film hiding among the clunky mess we were given. ",7zqsdy
dv8us5m,"Also, I got pretty strong cancer parallels. Why does cancer exist? What is its purpose, as it sees it? Why does cancer attack other cells? 

Cancer exists because it exists. It doesn't have a purpose. It doesn't attack out of malice or greed or expansionism; it isn't consciously aware of the fact that it causes destruction; it doesn't have a consciousness. It just *is*. That just-is-ness is one of the reasons why cancer (and similar diseases) are so scary. There's no purpose, there's no reasoning, they just *are*, and what they are is destructive to what you are.

Likewise, whatever the alien is just...is. I'm almost certain the lack of motivation was explicitly addressed in the film. It might react to you [as with the scene towards the end, with the humanoid attacking Lena](#spoiler), but it doesn't *want* anything. It isn't working towards a goal. It just spreads, mindlessly, like a cancer metastasizing. ",7zqsdy
dv9t8vv,"I think the cancer themes are too overt for it to be metaphor. If there's a metaphor here, it's depression. ",7zqsdy
dvb1gyi,"That's the biggest problem: the thematic elements of the film get in the way of just the basic story. You're just so distracted by how the plot is kind of all over the place that the themes never solidy into something meaningful. Like sure, now they're two different people that embrace each other after trauma, but it just doesn't make sense from a story sense.",7zqsdy
dv8ds5r,"I really like this idea. It’s unfortunate that nothing else about the film seems to push this theme. A force as meaningless as it is powerful makes for great contrast with the assumptions of human civilization, as you point out... but once again I feel that this film had too many ideas and couldn’t get them to cohere and play nice.

dvh0e42,The guy that was cut open and left in the pool also had the tattoo. So it means they must have gotten it from the man but maybe the man got it from someone else. Is it a side effect of the shimmer? It's so ambiguous. ,7zqsdy

dw1cko9,"I had some problems with the movie, but I don't think that Kane's double living is as big of a plot hole as you think it is. From what I could tell all of the plants affected by the shimmer were connected by a giant 'root' system. When they get to the swampside house with the alligator Lena mentions that all of the different flower species are growing off of one plant system. So when the fire starts, it spreads like a cancer throughout the entire connected body that is the shimmer. However, Kane's clone was not connected to the shimmer any more, it was it's own being that just happened to be created by the shimmer. In the same way I don't think any of the other mutated creatures burned at all they're probably still out there. 

Maybe I missed some information and I'm off track, but this seems at least plausible to me.",7zqsdy

dvwpdow,"I think you're right. Or at least, her rebirth is already underway. I missed it the first time, but if you look at her veins, they look plantlike. Also, there seems to be something green growing through the scars on her arm. She turns to Lena one last time, and there are leaves growing out of her arm. Then just before she is hidden from view, you can see the leaves and twigs more clearly. (It's a pity that the film didn't have a wider global release in cinemas, that would have been more obvious on a bigger screen. I totally get why they chose not to do it though. Suppose I'll have to buy a bigger tv, lol)

I really enjoy it when there are these hidden details in movies, I don't always notice them, and when I do I don't always understand what they mean, but they give a movie a certain texture.

To get back to the alien life form, i thought a cool thing about the ending is that the substance takes on her, including her emotions (hence why it kept the grenade in its hand). The government thought it was “dead” because it wasn’t observable at the light-tower, but by the look in her husbands eyes that glows in hers after the hug as well it is clear that life form or energy had transferred or altered the dna and form of the two “survivors” ",7zqsdy

This film is better on an individual scene by scene basis. The bear scene and the climax in the Light House are both better than than any individual scene in Arrival. It's so hard to build a climax that really lives up to what the film is building towards in high sci-fi. I think the Light House scene is comparable to the end of 2001. It's really just that good.

I don't know and I agree that this flaw will ruin the experience for some people. 
Like you said, the movie is classed as a Sci-fi and it fails at representing the basic human behavior in a big way. I can pretend that people involved in the observation of the Shimmer were affected by it...but it will not ratify all the flaws of logic at the beginning of the movie.

When she passes out after trying to hit it with the tripod, the copy remains standing up. It doesn't lie down and mimic her position until after Lena starts to stir on the ground. After they both collapse after Lena gets crushed against the door, they both wake up in exactly the same places they fell down in (Lena on the left, copy on the right).

I think the copy accepts the grenade partly because it's still mimicking and learning from Lena, partly because they've started to form a different kind of connection, and partly because it's inherited her self-destructive qualities.

It seems to me to be the height of arrogance to worry about the fact that there are unknowable realms and entities. Because, OF COURSE. We know so little. We are so small. We should assume that we are surrounded by a universe we can barely comprehend. This is a great, healthy disposition that includes gratitude and surrender.

dvw38qf,"It's fine if you didn't understand the film or my analysis of it. A big reason the film wasn't released as a box office movie in theaters worldwide was that it was deemed ""too intellectual"" and ""too complicated"" for general audiences. The director was asked to change the ending to make it more appealing for a wider audience but he kept it the same. That's why it ended up on Netflix. It's in this article: 
https://theplaylist.net/annihilation-intellectual-audiences-20171208/

Nowhere in my analysis did I say that cancer was related to a failed relationship. Where did you read that??? It all relates to self destruction hence the title of the film is Annihilation. 

Cancer put simply is when a person's cells grow and divide continuously  forming tumours that interfere with the body's normal processes. Essentially the body is killing itself, self destruction. 

Lena was having an affair which lead to her relationship with Kane failing. If she was in such a happy marriage, why would she have an affair? It's because of the self destructive tendencies of humans. Same reason we drink ourselves to death, ruin our lungs by smoking or cut ourselves when we are depressed. 

In simple terms, the film explores humanity's need to self-destruct.",7zqsdy

I mean its pretty heavily implied in the film in my opinion. Everything in the shimmer slowly destroying/changing, the characters have destructive tendencies from their past (Natalie Portman cheated on her husband, her husband only left because he knew about her cheating so he didn't care if he died, Radek and her cutting, etc.) Alex Garland even says it in interviews that this is what its about: 

[""I think the main thematic preoccupation probably belongs primarily to the film, which is really about self-destruction. It’s about the nature of self-destruction in a literal sense: cells have life cycles and stars have life cycles and plants and the universe and us. You, me, everyone. But also psychological forms of self-destruction.""](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/21/17029500/annihilation-ex-machina-director-alex-garland-sci-fi)

Now, I believe that the movie is not only about self-destruction but also about self-destruction and it's innate tendency in humanity, and overcoming it. 

>Again, this has been regurgitated here without anyone questioning if this is in fact true. Wasn't it blatantly clear that at least half the team were not suicidal when they wanted to ""get the fuck out of here!"" They even voted on it, and was pissed as hell when Portman's character didn't support their decision to leave. This idea that all of them had a death wish did not come from the movie. The author may have related that to his readers, and suddenly, it's being accepted without argument.

That did happen, but earlier in the movie Sheppard is conversing with Lena over people on the team, and she says: ""Guess there had to be something. Volunteering for... this. It's not exactly something you do if your life is in... perfect harmony. We're all damaged goods here.""
So I think it's pretty clear that everyone involved, especially having known that no other team has returned, understand they are probably going to die. And they volunteered for it.

As for the Henrietta Lacks, I did not know that, that's pretty interesting. I just remember having read the book in high school and when it appeared in the movie I thought ""Ayyyyyy""",7zqsdy
dw4y2ax,"Yeah, this entire film is about self-destruction, in it's entirety, 100%. 

SPOILERS BELOW:

When Ventruss says that no one is suicidal, but almost everyone is self-destrcutive, and that it's human nature to destroy what could have been a happy marriage, and we as an auidence are left to speculate that that's why the husband left, you thought that had no thematic relevenace?

Or when it's revealed that it's Lena destroyed her own marriage via an affair she didn't even enjoy, that's not about self-destruction?

When the way that Lena 'defeats' the entity in the end is by giving it the opportunity to self destruct, when we see her husband self-destruct on screen, when Josie self-destructs out of a lack of willingness to live and Anya self-destructs out of fear, and Ventruss self-destructs on her quest for answers, none of that clued you in as to what this film is about?

I'm just sort of amazed by your comment.

EDIT: I've just read your other replies to MrJohz, and I guess I say actually nevermind.

I hope, in future, you can come to look at media without breaking your own sense of self.",7zqsdy
dw4pw9v,"I haven't really read much discussion of the film, and I haven't read the book.  Having just watched it, my initial impression (before even coming to this thread) was very much that the underlying theme was self-destruction.  For a start, there's a crucial segment of dialogue that is entirely about the self-destructive capacities of the individual characters.  I think that really sets the mood for everything that follows after that.

Then you've got the two central characters and their own self-destructive natures.  One cheats on the other, the other uses the military to stay as far away from the one as possible, to the point of signing up to a suicide mission.  The reveal that Lena has been cheating on Kane comes almost right next to the discussion with Ventress about why Kane would come on this mission.

And, of course, there's the climax - both of the two main characters end up killing themselves.  One kills their true self, the other their other self, but they're both very literal acts of self-destruction.

Maybe Kane's consciousness permeated The Shimmer enough for it to sense his attachment to Lena. The ScreamBear didn't attack the other women out of hunger, it just killed them. Josie gives up and turns into a Flower Child. The next time we see Lena she's made it to the Lighthouse, seemingly without any other obstacles in her path. I haven't read the books so idk if I'm way off base here. The movie's ending is vague enough that several theories could work.  ",7zqsdy
duv4sax,also it's possible that other team members did in fact turn on each other and the changes they were going through made them go mad,7zqsdy
duwu70i,"That's an interesting perspective.

>Not-Kane was an exact copy of Kane, but only surface deep--only what he chose to show throughout his entire time in the Shimmer.

What brought you to this conclusion? Since the mimics were created from the blood of the ""original"" person, I assumed that they were copied from DNA, not just what they saw. From that, I assumed the mimics were full copies, not just surface level lookalikes.

When Lena's mimic was created, it took time to form, first a general outline, then a physical appearance... that's all we see from this transformation. BUT, based on what we know from Kane's mimic, I think that transformation continues. It starts to grow organs, it starts to have blood inside, etc. This would explain its sudden convulsions and coma at the beginning, and also it being miraculously fine at the end... maybe it finally was fully developed. We didn't see a man breaking down, we saw one being created.

If this is the case, it's essentially a clone of Kane, and a second chance at real life outside. It also seems that Kane had time to talk to and teach his mimic at least a few things before he decided to end his own life. Based on the fact that he told it to go find Lena, it makes sense that he had time to learn about it, teach it, and decide it was safe enough to tell it to go find her. Maybe he also saw it as a second chance. A happier version of himself that can look past (or doesn't know about) the affair.

Now, I definitely think both of them are dramatically different. I think the shimmer lives on inside their cells and I don't think they're going to go home and everything will be back to normal... there's are an infinite number of paths I think it could take.

I realize all theories are valid, but this is one way I thought it could be interpreted.",7zqsdy

In the book none of them know each other - nor ever want to get to know each other, everyone is their own isolated self (as is required of them for the mission), and there is a constant aire of not knowing if what they are talking about is real or not. No mind control by the psychologist in the movie (none that was explicit at least.) The biologist doesn't have a military background. Complete different use of the word ""Annihilation"" as a main plot point. Also everything in the book, except for ""The Crawler"" is completely sight unseen. No man-bear pig, etc.

duz0dys,">  Not even hints of that going on, unless I missed something.

I was confused about this too. It's one of two things:

- They lost their memory from entering the Shimmer, and never lost any memory again. This would be sort of strange, wouldn't it? Why bother losing memory once if it never happens again?
- They continually lost chunks of time but the movie didn't focus on it, and we're left to assume there were other bits of amnesia.

Maybe the source material have more on this. Or maybe there were zero memory issues in the source. I dunno.",7zqsdy
dv620hd,"Yes! I think you nailed it. We are so quick to judge change. Particularly anything that threatens the deepest aspects of our identity like, for instance, our tendency toward self-destruction. 

We desperately cling to the parts of ourselves that don't even serve us because we're terrified of losing ourselves and becoming something new and unknown. Our self-destructiveness is our identify as a species, and without it we would be lost. 

I also wonder about the cloning capability of the ""alien."" You know how the image of the dividing cell keeps popping up? Lena and her clone are kinda like two identical cells. 

This film makes me think of non-attachment. Nature simply is. And we give meaning to it. Whether we name something horrific or beautiful. There is no inherent quality to anything. Everything comes from dividing cells. The less we judge the wider our ability to see reality in it's infinite state, not just the reality we perceive within our self-created contextual borders (prisons?).",7zqsdy

This film is already a flop even though its better more original and ambitious than the majority of films released so far.

duqpwi4,"I think this is spot on. Lena says that she knows why Kane accepted this particular assignment. He accepted what was essentially a suicide mission (entering the Shimmer) due to his feelings of betrayal and heartbreak about her infidelity. Accepting the mission and heading into the Shimmer are self-destructive actions on his part, borne out of a reaction to the pain he's feeling.
  
When he records his suicide note, I believe we are essentially seeing the same character on both sides of the camera. We are simply seeing two sides of his personality physically manifested into two separate (but identical) individuals. We see the duality of his character earlier in the film, outside of the Shimmer, with one Kane at a time exhibiting different traits/demeanors. In the scene where he leaves to go on assignment, he shows the same emotionless demeanor that he does earlier in the film when he returns home. This illustrates that the Kane we see return home near the beginning of the film, the Kane we see leaving home a day early to go on his mission, as well as the Kane who stands behind the camera at the lighthouse, are essentially just different aspects of the same character who we see laughing in bed with his wife and blowing himself up with a grenade. The only difference is that, inside the Shimmer, the two parts of this character literally manifest as two separate physical beings.",7zqsdy
durwcj8,"Supporting this, the water split like cells when Lena put the glass down.",7zqsdy
duy2i5m,"I think this is exemplified when Kane looks into the camera and says something to the effect of ""I thought I was a man but I'm not so sure. Am I you? Are you me?"" I think once the copy is made it doesn't matter. I think the aliens ultimate goal is to create a duplicate so that either can survive. I think in Kane's case the duplicate came out, and in Lena's the original came out, but they are each to half's to the same whole.


What are you thoughts on why the duplicate destroyed the lighthouse at the end? I have two theories.

One, that the shimmer was an incubation period for this life form to thrive and find suitable hosts to copy, and could destroy it's self once it did in order to infiltrate the dominant species with it's own mutated hybrid of alien/human life. I don't think the alien life would have sentience on it's own, but does all of this automatically. This might explain why Kane gets better once the lighthouse is destroyed.


The second is that once the mirror of Lena touched her, it garnered her self-destructive nature and her intention to destroy the lighthouse, and ""mimicked"" that intuition as her last act, after they were officially a part of each other. This would also explain why the shimmer seems to caress Kane's face as she is setting the lighthouse on fire.

",7zqsdy
dusos8o,"> The movie is a story about self-destructive behavior. Sometimes you ""just do"" things that mess up your life but they're opportunities to reflect - take a (literal in this case) look at ""yourself"" and learn from it.

And I agree, the movie certainly kept me thinking afterwards (which I liked about it), I just have some criticisms. 

I also like the idea about the shimmer clone lying in the debrief, but if that is what they were going for I think they could have done it better. Like, maybe throughout the movie some of the questions that Benedict Wong asks could be voice over, which could make the audience think that Lena is being snapped back to the present in the debrief. And every time Lena answers, her answers correspond to what the audience just watched to make them feel like she is a reliable narrator. Then, at the end with the last question, Lena lies to Benedict Wong. That could have been a cool moment.",7zqsdy

dv08nvm,">The film heavily suggests that wasn't Lena being questioned at all but her double created in The Shimmer. The new infinity symbol tattoo on her arm that the soldier who got gutted and Anya had which wasn't there before she entered The Shimmer, and the glowing eyes (like the Kane double) that we see in the last shot is evidence of this. This means the Lena double was lying to the people questioning her. It puts everything we saw happen after Lena entered into The Shimmer into question. It could have all been lies, some lies, or just the last fight being a lie (maybe the alien did the grenade trick and not Lena).

The biologist mentions during the movie says that every organism has the potential for immortality, but through an accidental random mutation was put on a timer. (I didn't like that bit because the evolution of apoptosis (programmed cell death) and death developed as a beneficial trait in a population.

As much as I liked the film I was left wanting more - if there were one subplot from the books I could put back in, it would be around the nature of the expedition (and I'm cheating because there are several tendrils to that one subplot!): [although the Psychologist was prickly in the film, she isn't as antagonistic as the book - I miss the hypnosis, that ""ANNIHILATION!

Third book has elements of second person. It hops around chronologically and fills in a lot (but not all) of the blanks between first and second. It gives more character to people previously touched on and has its own fair share of mystery and sci-fi horror.

That's anathema to his thoroughly rationalist, materialist understanding of the universe, so he fixates on it instead of trying to ignore it... has made the occult interest in Lovecraft since all the more hilarious, since to him their beliefs would be utterly incompatible with his own. Classic case of mistaking the author's work for their beliefs.

I haven't seen  the film yet so I'm not sure what ending Lena got in it, but in the book the ending is entirely compatible with the concept of understanding the universe as though the Copenhagen interpretation is literally true... which you gotta admit is terrifying to anyone who values science as we currently understand it.

I would suggest that Renya's reaction to the video tape of the worm inside the man's belly is a compromise between your two views. She certainly denies the reality of what she sees and goes crazy. She starts breaking down as her sense of self is changed without her consent (fingerprints melting, etc). When faced with the unknowable, she denies it and retreats into madness. Classic Lovecraft. 

Lena, however, is aware of the darkness and pain of life. She is aware of her destructive actions (cheating) and that Kane might know. She is focused on finding him and getting out. She has a purpose. She is willing to go to the depths of the unreal (the cave in the lighthouse - a straight up Lovecraftian short story title!! ) and face her shadow and blow it up with a LITERAL GRENADE OF LIGHT. 

Light/consciousness/God/awareness/mind whatever always trumps the shadow. Light always clears away the darkness. Lena is the hero because she faces the darkness and burns it down with light. Vantress faced the shadow and became light, but lost her self in it. She was unable to balance the polarity of light and dark. Self and shadow. ",7zqsdy

Once the clone took Lena’s physical appearance suddenly the mimickry stopped and the Lena holding the phosphorous grenade stood there perplexed.

That is also the reason that Lena crawled back into the hole as a last ditch effort to destroy the shimmer.

I think it was clear that original Lena survived (the director notes in an interview that he chose to make it less ambiguous) because he wants you to question how different clone Kane and original Lena actual are from their counterparts, considering they both have been changed by the shimmer (the flicker of it in their eyes at the end). The original scripted ending makes it very clear that it is very unclear which Lena survived, while the movie wants you to consider despite which Lena she is, how different is she really from the clone of herself, or the clone of Kane is from himself?

I think (clone) Kane hugged her mimicking the hug she gave him from the beginning when he came back. Whether or not it is due to 'love' is left to the viewer to decide, but I think there are multiple clues that lead us to the idea that the copies share 'intentions' as well as the physical form of their originals.

One thing I'm curious about is how much (clone) Kane will remember, and how much he will think like the original.

dvyev0n,"The way the team reacts throughout the movie... one isn't sure if that's due to the Shimmer someone affecting their minds/emotions, whether its a result of the time distortion (and they don't remember) or if they were just sort of broken down by themselves. That's a deliberate plot mechanic and it adds to the tension, it was one of my favorite aspects of this movie. Just constantly looking at the team members and the interactions and left wondering ""what is causing them to act this way?"" 

Anya e.g. realizes that she's kind of going crazy in that scene before the bear shows up. She starts off with accusing Lena of having been the one that killed Cass, but then she comes back to her senses briefly and recalls that her two theories on why teams die in the Shimmer were 1) something kills them 2) they kill each other. She was beginning to have clarity that she's suffering some sort of breakdown and was going to be responsible for # 2, and then her psyche snaps back to paranoia and she runs out to the bear. Is that due to her paranoia/ptsd from seeing so much death/gore? Is the Shimmer affecting her mind? No one can be sure, maybe a bit of both?

Another thing that's not pointed out is the tattoos on the left arm. Lena states she got a ""Bruise"" when they are in the boat, but you can see the pattern is clearly the ouroboros tattoo which she has on her arm towards the end of her time in the Shimmer and even afterwards when she's being debriefed in the southern reach. 

What's interesting is that Anya, also starts out without a tattoo but then gets the tattoo on her arm by the time she takes everyone hostage. What is the significance of the tattoo? Why is it that only Anya and Lena got it? That's a nice little easter egg!

dusxbm9,"We can actually see mitosis under the microscope. However it obviously doesn't look like the it does in the movie. 

The main thing we use to visualize the cell cycle under the microscope is the cell's DNA.  Basically if the DNA (purple center) looks like tentacles that means the DNA is packed up and ready to divide.

http://www.the-cma.org.uk/articles/cancer-cells-how-they-live-forever-4685/
Also, in one scene she is reading the book ‘The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks’.  The book is about Henrietta Lacks and the immortal cell line, known as HeLa, that came from Lacks's cervical cancer cells in 1951.
",7zqsdy
dusjza9,"So normal cells , like each one in our body, actually lose a little bit of DNA when it divides. This is because the replication process has a 'flaw' in which the protein making DNA is unable to attach the last few basepairs (DNA information) on the tail. 

So we have evolved by making the Tail end of the DNA have lots of useless repitive data. That way we can buffer the loss of DNA. However it's only a temporary solution because eventually the buffer will run out and the cell will not be able to divide anymore. This mechanism is the reason we age and why life is finite. It's our 'biological clock' if you will. 

Cancer doesn't have this problem. Cancer cells can divide infinitely. In fact whenever people grow cells in culture for lab experiments and such, it's usually cancer cells because they will happily grow and divide forever.

The main reason they are able to do this is because they have a gene which basically adds on more buffer to their tails. So while they do lose some of their DNA they can just replace the useless protective DNA.
This gene is called telomerase.


So basically all life on earth has evolved from a precursor organism that never perfected DNA replication (as most things in biology) and because of that all living things will eventually die. Except for cancer and jellyfish. They seem to have found a way to theoretically live forever...Lol

So it was alien Kane who commited suicide by grenade? Because it looks like there's two Kanes on the video recorder (or my eyes tricked me).

So that means that the Kane and Lena who are back in the real world at the end are the real Kane and Lena, except for the fact they've been changed by the shimmer?",7zqsdy
dvlomn6,"The shimmer caused a bunch of mutations in all the DNA, right? But there seems to be an alien at the end as well. And it looked like the alien came out of the psychologist, so did the psychologist mutate into an alien or was she ""infected""?

And it also looks like the Kane and Lena that made it back are some kind of aliens (their eyes change colour at the very end). I just don't get why on one hand it's a zone that causes mutation, like some sort of radiation, and on the other hand there's a weird alien creature that changes into people or something.

If the returning Kane is an alien than the alien Kane must have somehow convinced the real Kane to kill himself with a phosporous grenade. But when real Lena is ""dancing"" with alien Lena it looks like real Lena gives alien Lena an armed grenade. And after it ignites you can clearly see the alien shape being burned. So if alien Lena was burned, why is there an alien Lena back in the real world?

dwelcsb,"We see two Kanes in the camcorder video, and it makes a kind of sense that the real Kane is the one who blew himself up and the clone Kane is the one who returned.

However, we also see skeletons outside the lighthouse. I took this to suggest that Kane's unit attacked and everyone died. I think some or all of them got cloned, though, maybe repeatedly. ""Kane"" was gone for a year, and we can only imagine what sort of complex interactions happened during that time. There could be clones of clones of clones. During that time, maybe the hostility of the Kane's fallen unit continued to get refracted and diffused into the animals like the croco-shark and the bear-corpse-thing, who single-mindedly pursued the scientists even when their bodies were being riddled with bullets. In animals, that militaristic fearlessness seemed just as unnatural as the plants that grew into human forms. The humans went in with aggression, and the aggression got refracted into other things.

We also see at the end that ""Dr. Ventress"" is an eyeless, mouth-less clone talking to herself until Lena speaks to her. Then she turns around and she has a face. I suspect the same thing happened when ""Kane"" returned - maybe he was an unfinished clone lurking in the house until the moment when he said he says he recognized Lena, and that moment is when he became the ""Kane"" that we see.",7zqsdy

One of the many things I love about that film is that you do get a solid picture of Gosling's character (I'm being as vague as possible to not spoil anything for you), but it doesn't detract from what you take away from the film; in fact, it only strengthens what the film is saying about humanity, and ends up being beautifully hopeful.",7zqsdy

",7zqsdy
dushrbz,It differs in many ways. The main way I would say is that in the book the psychologist is hypnotizing the other members of the expedition until the biologist inhales spores that make her immune to the hypnotic ques.

Also in the book the psychologist kills a few of the others by forcing them into that hole thing via hypnosis.,7zqsdy

dvrlsku,"> That is almost true for the entire movie, except for the end when we get the omniscient perspective showing the clone going into the hole while the real Lena is on the beach. So I'm not sure the shimmer narrative being unreliable is viable.

First of all - surviving Lena might herself be genuinely unaware that she's the clone. The period where Lena loses consciousness and then wakes up seems to be the best ""opportunity"" for the switch to occur.

And - the fact we get a glimpse of what seems to be the omniscient perspective does not mean that scenes with Lena in them happened exactly as we see.
It could very well be that the ""mimic"" destroying the lighthouse and itself etc. happened this way - but it was actually a transformed Lena, while the clone is the one that leaves.

Personally, I favor the interpretation in which the original Lena survives, since it has some advantages over the alternatives, 

but i also like that it's made sufficiently ambiguous.

Though the significance is *certainly* subject to different kinds of interpretation, you yourself were able to draw a conclusion that the abstract symbol of a fetus in space was supposed to show cyclical life. Here's the important part: *within the context of the film, that is a deduction that is capable of being made. It fits the themes of the film and is supported by other events that contextualize that argument within the film.*

 We *certainly* don't have an answer as to why Clone Kane survived The Shimmer's eradication, because *everything that we know in The Shimmer has died, except Kane.* We don't know why that is. Out of all my gripes, this one bugs me thoe most: we don't know why Lena isn't drastically changing the environment of the laboratory or those around her, when she clearly has some kind of manipulative effect on the glass of water. And before anyone says, ""But hazmat suits, but two-way mirrors, but isolated environment--"" This effect of The Shimmer was so great that someone got their DNA entwined with a goddamned bear, and we're supposed to deduce that Lena has significantly effected by The Shimmer despite being outside of it. Anything that posits an answer to these question is unfounded speculation, because the film **deliberately creates ambiguities to the facts and context of the film's logic.** These are plot points we're talking about, not even interpretations of the plot points. It defies what we have expected from the past two hours of watching, just for the hell of it. This is what frustrates me. And hey, that same reason might be the very reason why other people besides me like the movie, and that's okay. But I find it to be a little cheap. If the director wanted to be more abstract like the books, then it should have been less concrete with its exposition. If he wanted it to be less abstract, he should have filled in the gaps a little more tightly. But what we have here is noncontinuous tone of storytelling, to which anyone who wants to defend the film's merit can argue: ""Unreliable narration,"" ""sci-fi logic"" or ""we're not supposed to know."" I simply find that cheap. Good movies that have these qualities still have explanations to the exposition. ",7zqsdy

It confirmed my theory that the shimmer had tried to make something like the humanoid at least once before, and that something was the copy Kane.

That, in turn, made me realize that copy Kane's foggy explanation of how he got home wasn't just his mind being scrambled by the shimmer. It must have teleported him there just as Lena's humanoid teleported to the main room of the lighthouse as she escaped from the underground chamber.

I realized there may have been more intelligence to the screaming bear than I first ascribed to it. When Lena finds Cass' body, only her throat has suffered significant damage. It's as if the bear was less interested in eating her and more interested in ""harvesting"" her voice to become a better hunter. Of course, it begs the question of why the bear is hunting in the first place if it doesn't eat. Some left over animal instinct? A sort of bodyguard meant to kill any human who gets too far in?

",7zqsdy
dvxj011,"I think the alien was able to teleport. This is shown when Lena leaves the underground area after shooting the alien, it disappears and reappears inside the lighthouse. 

This would also explain the dialogue at the beginning. Lena asks the clone Kane:

>""Kane, how did you get home.""

Kane responds:

>""I was outside... outside the room. The room with the bed. The door was open, I saw you, I recognised you, your face.""

He went from the lighthouse and ended up in the house ""outside the room."" The duplicate Kane did this because the original Kane told it to find Lena.

The military didn't become aware that he was still alive until Lena called the paramedics explaining that her husband Kane was ill. They didn't see him walk out of the shimmer because he teleported.",7zqsdy

* Kane clone is tethered to the Shimmer, which allows him to teleport back to their house. This also means that once away from the Shimmer, his body begins to fail. Thus when the Shimmer is destroyed, he should have also died. 
* Kane clone is replicated from Kane, who had organ failure at the time of cloning. Thus Kane clone inherited his failing health. But in the end he... magically gets better?

There was all the layers of motivations and weirdness that were lost I think.

",7zqsdy
duqasum,"I see your point. But I think that if the single conversation about self-destruction hadn't taken place, that message wouldn't have carried. The women involved were on a spectrum of self-destructive. To really make that resonate, they needed more personal background of behaviors to reinforce that. Because they all seem kind of bubbly and excited the beginning, then do a very sharp reversal to say; No, in fact, they want to destroy themselves. 

So that would mean that every person who goes into The Shimmer wants to self destruct. Which starts getting kind of flimsy as a premise.

If it instead was somehow calling to living creatures that were suffering form terrible trauma, it might stand to imply that they are unable to cope with what they have become and then surrender to the inevitable oblivion of their hopes and dreams about they might become.

I guess for me if fear is the core of a lot of our decisions, self-destruction is symptomatic. One of many outcomes that people suffer from INSIDE The Shimmer. Beside self-destruction, there is distrust, paranoia, anger, despair, rage, etc. Self destructive attitudes are only a part of that: the outcome of trauma and decisions that had unintended consequences.",7zqsdy
duqbp09,"Lena went in for selfish reasons, and as far as I could tell the others were just part of a team. They all had attributes that helped the idea of the expedition and didn't seem to go in to accomplish any kind of personal goal. 

The leader went in because she was dying and had nothing to lose and also wanted to redeem her decisions to send in so many people to their deaths. Her character would have been so much more fascinating if they had kept some of the elements from the later books, where she was a child in the town where the comet hit the lighthouse and has been exposed to Area-x/ventured into Area-X secretly for decades while trying to understand it.

And as far as I could tell, one of the members was sad over the loss of her child/former self, the other had struggled with depression and self harm and the other...I honestly have no idea why she was there except to be the tough one who goes nuts. The sad woman entering and dying was of no real consequence to the story, the self-harming one just gives up and joins the others that have given up after enduring Area-X, and the tough one just moves the plot forward and gets demolished by the bear. I'm not sure where any self-destruction or resolution to any of their stories takes place.

I like your idea of copies being made that are given all either the negative or positive characteristics of the original but I don't think that was conveyed enough in a very stoic Kane character/clone after the original self-immolates. Neither was it in the drawn out mimic process of Lena where she finds a deus ex machina grenade and blows up Area-X without any real motivation except to escape and survive. ",7zqsdy

A bunch of bumbling and incompetent scientists managed to get two people all the way to the lighthouse where teams of elite military had failed, even those approaching from a more advantageous route.

Yeah, there are some spooky monsters, but nothing so bad that good old fashioned guns couldn't take them down (up until the end that is). And the mental breakdown didn't happen very quickly either. The only one of them that became significantly incapacitated by this was a paramedic who clearly did not have the skills or resolve to accomplish this mission in the first place.

A military team who actually knew how to use guns, moved quickly, and had the brainpower to stay up in the watchtower instead of sending one person to the low ground to keep watch would easily have made it to the lighthouse.

Edit: To elaborate a little on their incompetence:

1. Lena is the only one who reacted properly to the gator and unloaded on it. One lady fired tentatively and the others did nothing.

2. They found an elevated watchtower, but sent the only person on sentry duty down to a less defensible spot a ways away from the tower. Also one of them took a sedative.

3. When they knew something had breached the perimeter, they didn't go hunting for it in a methodical way, nor did they take up a solid defensive position. Instead, they all gave up their defensible high ground and stood in an open field. One even walked ahead of her comrades (which got her killed).

4. The paramedic was so unstable that she was ready to kill/vivisect her own team members. The shimmer is stated to have a psychological effect, but the others were not affected nearly this much.",7zqsdy

In what way are they contrived? Surely your first thought, knowing their mission, is why would anyone willingly go in there?

It reminded me of Colour out of Space, wherein the titular alien entity is so alien and incomprehensible that you couldn't even apply science as we understand it to it and come out the other end with any real understanding of the phenomenon, but the folk in that story have a sense of what it's doing, they say it's draining life, or energy, but that doesn't necessarily make sense with science as we understand it, same with this, you understand what the phenomena does by the end of the movie, since it's shown to do everything we see it do multiple times and to maintain it's status of being truly alien it has to be something we can't understand in technical terms, it's simply too alien. You can choose to get annoyed about it I suppose, but you're definitely missing the point, and I'm personally very into the whole cosmic horror, incomprehensible other reality thing, so I rather enjoyed it.

The Southern Reach was desperate. Ventress was desperate. They were ALL DESPERATE. These are even core themes from the movie.

duqbkoc,"Agreed. My one struggle with the Lena theory is that is true for 95% of the movie, but once she sees the video and sees that he died and once she sees her clone turn into herself, she had to realize it was his clone that made it through, not him.

Now tell me -- do you want a thousand heavily armed troops with tanks driving out of the shimmer in an orgy of blood and destruction if theory number two is correct?

The guy in the lighthouse was horrified by what he was becoming. It's right there in the dialogue about he wasn't sure who he was anymore and how his flesh was moving like water. He couldn't go on feeling like a monster. Ventress burst into light because the shimmer's ""core"" seemed to be using her as the raw materials to create a copy of Lena. Lena pretty clearly did kill her copy. She already had the tattoo long before confronting the clone in the lighthouse. It's a sign that she was so changed by the experience that she's just as alien as the actual creatures.

Her affair was what made her husband go off into the shimmer. She told her lover that her husband had found out about them, and her husband is very emotionally distant to her when he says goodbye for his mission into the shimmer. She feels guilty for driving him away with the affair and feels obligated to fix him by finding some clue to how the shimmer works. That last one is almost spoon fed to the audience word for word.

dvmljei,"Why they didnt drive in with tanks,boats or helicopter could had many explanations. I only disliked that they did not explain that in a short scene or conversation piece in the movie. Maybe the shimmer changes the chemical properties of gasoline very fast after it enters the shimmer. Or it takes appart every vehicle bolt by bolt to analize it and then fuses it with the soldiers inside the vehicle to some strange metal-machine-human hybrid with is barley functional to live. And if they send in drones, it very quickly transforms the drones into something weird half alive have dead like the crystal trees at the light house , for example so that they lose connection to everything remote controlled very fast.

And the question of why did they act so weird in the shimmer is because thats what the shimmer does. It takes appart everything and rearranges it in a different way, even their mind. Beside of that the humans seem to at least partwise can control how they end up, depending on their character and belives and mindset they have in the shimmer, which explains why they mutate into different things.

But yes there are definitely a few other plot holes in this movie like:

- Why didnt they go in while wearing a hazzard suite and why did they touch every mutation with their hands?

- why does natalie portmans character not know that this giant light bubble exists on her planet since several years. I mean how do you keep something like this secret from the rest of the world. You probably can see it from hundret of kilometers away. How can the us military hide something like this so that she does not know.How can they hide it from the satellites of the other countrys.Even if the bubble would refract all light(which it does not because you can see its color from the outside) it would show as giant black anomaly on the sensors of the other spy sattelties?

Kane went through the same process and both emerge with reborn/altered versions of themselves through the opening of the hole.

Therefore, the best possible Lena (maybe still genetically altered by the shimmer) and the best possible Kane made it back ""home"". Survival of the fittest ;)

> So much dumb/shitty/obvious dialogue.

I think this is one of the most valid criticisms, but I was personally able to give it a pass considering how they had the fascinating challenge of writing dialogue with the knowledge that mannerisms and the way people talk was also going to get refracted. It's why Kane had a slight southern drawl at the very end. I don't know if the stilted dialogue was intentional or incompetent, either way, it didn't work very well, but I still admire the ambition and attention to detail that the actors were clearly directed to pick up each other's mannerisms through the movie.

>Fucking Gina Rodriguez. Like, what an idiot. I get that they're scared and shit, but literally one guy out of hundreds ever made it out alive of the shimmer. You're going to volunteer to go in and then shit yourself at the first sign of trouble/death? Her 'fuck it i'm out' scene was so dumb & cliche. Also, her reaction to the video was stupid. Some guys insides are clearly becoming a fucking monster, ""yup, that's a light trick"". Like what, are you blind?

This has the clearest explanation. I'm pretty disappointed Buny didn't pick up the fact  that she was the one who had a drug problem, considering how they literally spelled it out. That's why  she began to second-guess everything and insisted what they were seeing wasn't real but was a light trick. She signed up for danger, but she didn't sign up for something that made her feel like she was relapsing into mental decay and drugged out hallucinations. The whole seeing her fingerprints changing is especially horrifying for her because as a recovering drug addict, having all this happen to her probably made her feel like she was losing control over her identity and existence again like how probably felt while she had her drug problem.

>What happened to the whole ""losing track of time"" thing that they introduced literally the second they went into the shimmer? It would have been cool to keep exploring that concept. Instead, they just mention it once and it's completely forgotten about. When Portman mentions ""we've been travelling for 6 days now"" later in the film. Like what the fuck? We can keep track of time now? The first part of the shimmer didn't happen?

That wasn't abandoned. At the very beginning of the movie we're told she was in there for far longer than she thought they were. The scene where they discover they lost time was to throw all their perceptions of time out the window. They said they've been traveling for 6 days now. That's clearly not true.

>Tessa Thompson's character just going ""fuck it, i'm becoming a tree"" scene was hilarious. Such a dumb ending to a dumb character. She added pretty much nothing to the plot and her only big discovery was something that Portman's character probably knew anyways. Fitting end to her character.

This is another example of not picking up on the clues. She was suicidal, yes, but she was also there to balance out how each of the women went into the shimmer with very personal problems and they all wanted to get something out of the shimmer, whether they knew it or not. Each of the character either got what they wanted, or saw their own feelings/problems reflected/refracted back to them. Josie was suicidal and wanted simultaneously to feel alive and to disappear, since she clearly had depression but also cut herself as a way to cope. So of course she embraces the shimmer instead of being afraid of disappearing.

>Could they get people that weren't complete fucking psychos for this mission? Was there no one else more mentally balanced to volunteer? Given the stakes, I'm guessing the government could've picked from a million more emotionally-stable people to go in. Wouldn't you pick better people for this mission? They even mention that they're 'damaged goods'. Okay, the fate of the world depends on this fucking Suicide Squad.

This is also a valid point. I kept on expecting an explanation of some kind, because there was such a weird vibe from the psychiatrist and I kept on feeling like there was something wrong with her, her motivations, and her motivations for picking out this particular team. She seemed to be obsessed about the idea of self-destruction, considering where her own life was headed and how her own cells were literally taking her down with them through self-destruction. However I don't think there's as much evidence as there are for the other characters' motivations about whether she picked these people out because of her own warped view on what makes a good candidate due to her cancer.

>They had a perfect spot to camp out in that guard house, above everything with a perfect vantage point of the whole base. Instead, they send a single non-combatant to guard a random shed at the bottom? Are you shitting me? These idiots deserved to get eaten by a mutant-bear.

This also had a blatantly clear reason. The psychiatrist simply didn't really care about her personal safety or the safety of the other crew anymore, because of her cancer. They were clearly supposed to be at the high vantage point, which is why natalie portman's character spent several moments looking for her there and looked surprised when she saw her on the ground instead. It's why the whole thing that happened really was Ventura's fault. I feel bad for her, but her cancer made her a terrible candidate to go in there and also made her a terrible leader.

>Related to the above point, Leigh's character is plotting their next move? Like, you guys didn't even fucking plan where you were going to go before going in? Months went into prepping the mission and nobody thought ""huh, where should our main characters go?"". They always had the map, they only started using it once they went into the spooky alien wasteland?

This point confuses me because Buny pointed out himself a little before this that they lost track of time. They're disoriented because they don't even know where they are. Once they've found a point to orient themselves, then they are able to start using the map again....His own problems with the movie answers his other problems.

>What was up with the whole cheating storyline? What did that bring to the story exactly? Also, that post-sex scene was so fucking dumb. ""This is never to happen again, I hate you, my husband knows"". So why were you two fucking 20 seconds ago. Also, that guy's line delivery of ""does he know about our affair"" was way too on-the-nose and awkward. No one says that.

Idk how I feel about this problem. It seems like kind of a weird one, because they're both in a really strange situation, and in my experience when two parties are in a an unfamiliar situation, people rarely know what the proper procedure is and what to say, and that's how you end up saying things you normally wouldn't, because people aren't usually in a position where they've cheated on someone they love and immediately end up regretting it and feeling self-loathing. I hope. The dialogue in this movie is really stilted and weird, but this was not one of the scenes where that jumped out at me. 

Also the cheating reveal was pretty important...because it explains Kane's odd behavior before he left, why he says 'I do. I do love you', even knowing he's going out to a suicide mission. The key here is that Kane knew she was cheating. Again this was spelled out, so I'm sorry Buny missed it. It also explains Lena's motivations, why she feels responsible for him basically going in to kill himself, why she can't move on, and why she was willing to put her life at risk to save him.

>-This would make the movie irrelevant so it's not a real complaint but like why the fuck doesn't their mission start at the coast? Like, that would bypass every single problem. It's a straight shot on the beach to the lighthouse instead of going into the deadly, spooky, shit-show of a jungle.

This is a really good point. There are a lot of logic problems with the premise of the movie, like why they can't use helicopters to drop people inside, etc etc. I imagine these problems were caused by possible rewrites, which doesn't really excuse the movie.

>If Portman is telling them the entire story, wouldn't they know that Oscar Isaac is some kind of alien-clone-human-monster? It's mentioned in her story that the real one kills himself. So they're just letting them interact with each other knowing 100% that one or both of them is a possibly dangerous alien?

We don't know what Portman is telling them. We're definitely supposed to infer that what we're seeing is what she's telling them, but the moment we see that tattoo on her arm and when she tells the guy that she wants to know what happened to her husband, two pretty big red flag should have been raised about her identity. Still referring to Kane as her husband implies she didn't tell them about what she saw in the video

I'm sorry Buny was disappointed because he wasn't paying that much attention to the movie, especially since he had some genuinely good points that were overshadowed by how little he seemed to have tried  before reacting to it. 

You seem to have had an immediate positive reaction to the movie, which is why I'm replying to you with my responses to Buny's problems. If he wasn't willing to do much work as an audience, that's his problem. But If you initially liked it, I think you should trust your initial judgment at first and take a bit of time thinking about why first before coming to a more solid conclusion. If you decide the movie wasn't for you, there's nothing wrong with that. Just don't want you to base your opinion on some observations lacking in critical thought.",7zqsdy

>You really want an answer to that? Remember the bear? Imagine what the shimmer could do to a shark or any kind of sea-life. Do you really want to fuck with that?

This is not a situation that can be solved by more guns, as evidence by the many squads of soldiers they have sent in and lost.
  
Actually, it's because the movie's adapting the book, and in the book there was only one way into Area X through a sort of invisible gateway. They dropped the gateway but kept the starting point the same in the movie, and lost the reasoning in the translation. They didn't know about the bear (because in the movie no one came back who could discuss what it's like in there) so that wouldn't be a valid reason to avoid the coast. Also in the book, they're going in to take samples and notes on Area X (many other expeditions had gone in, and though each group had a different reaction inside, many came back) rather than look for the lighthouse in general.

And then obviously the last ~20 minutes, especially when she's staring into the thing, were very visually reminiscent of tripping. And then her meeting herself and it dying could be representative of ego death and/or confronting things in your head.

dvny30v,"I need to rewatch it, but there's depth here.

For example, is this a movie about the annihilation of the human race, or self-annihilation? The characters are all self-destructive. But there's also Portman's character, who literally becomes not herself, or no longer knows what herself is. It's like the ego death you get from psychadelics or religious notions of self-annihilation. It's interesting that the characters choose different ways to 'transcend', or how one becomes part of the bear that eats her.

Solaris was always interesting, because it tied into religious ideas from Christianity(he leaves his father, painting of the prodigal sun, tower of bable) but also Gaian religions, with the little pot of earth which he takes to Solaris in montages of memories of his mother. Ie, mother earth, with the planet becoming a new mother earth for him. There's also weird bits in this film, which remind me of that. Being eaten by a bear, but also becoming the bear, as a sort of reincarnation.

Also, is Portman an unreliable narrator, did the alien actually kill Portman's character? Or is the alien duplicate just as much Portman by this stage? It really questions notions of what it means to be you. We tend to think we're the same person as we used to be, when arguably we're actually a different person, even on a cellular level with memories that have changed with time.

Also, the love story isn't a love story. Why did she go in? To die? Why did she convince the others to follow her further? Did she do it, because she was already an alien? She had a weird bruise from the shark, which stood out as a sort of Chekhov's gun. At one point she's asked about hallucinations, about seeing things which leads me to believe not everything they're seeing is real.

TLDR I don't understand everything in this movie yet, and that's mostly a good sign.",7zqsdy

Both drink from poured glasses. There's nothing in the water supply. 

On top of that, neither of them are ever leaving the government quarantine. It was a pretty good movie visually, but it really didn't make much sense.

I mentioned Arrival because it had a lot of themes and plot points going around that generated discussion, whether or not people are still discussing the film today - whether that be the ending, the government response, our response, the aliens and more. 

My issue with the film is that at the end of the day, it's still not a film that's complete. Whether you want to call mainstream audiences dumb, the film doesn't ever give a complete understanding of the story that anyone can interpret but leave intellectual discussion towards a higher plane of audience. The film doesn't explicitly need to tell me A+B=C, but the film never gives you anything to chew on other than it's scenery. It doesn't make anyone less intelligent because they didn't understand the film, it just makes the film flop on itself for not allowing the audience to get enough pieces of the puzzle to connect things.

Botany and Zoology are also explored, evidenced by the different plants and animals as well as their mutations.

And when Portman asks her why her husband signed on for a suicide mission, The Director rejects the notion and asks her if she really believes that.

One woman lost her daughter and was distraught, one woman had a problem with addiction possibly due to working as an paramedic, one of them had a history with self-harm most likely in her teens, and Lena had guilt over her affair. Nothing in the film suggested any of these women wanted to die. If anything they were hopeful and excited to be experiencing Area-x.

dvjf22x,"Right, but there's no 'connection.' Refraction is a phenomenon where different colors of light travel at different speeds in materials. In a glass prism, this leads to white light turning into a rainbow. With the DNA, what appears to be happening is species are interchangeably sharing genes with nearby neighbors. If the DNA is just automatically getting 'diffracted' into chunks (doesn't make sense anyway, but whatever) you're pretty much dead right away. Also, this doesn't tell us how different species get each other's DNA. 

Maybe it's all laid out in the book. I imagined it was some sort of virus-like particle that swapped genes around and also diffracted the light in the air (ice and snow crystals can do this). There was a concept a bit like this in one of the ender's game books.",7zqsdy

This is so fucking ignorant it's not even funny. Hollywood is going nuts over feminism right now and I haven't heard a single word about this movie being an all female cast. Not a peep.

Just did a search, not a single mention of cerebral.

>The CGI was distractingly bad in many spots. It hurt the rest of the otherwise pretty film.

The bear scene looks entirely convincing. The 'alien' scene was supposed to look unnatural and unworldly. That's the point. The rest of the film was gorgeous.

>There's no tension because...

Were you watching the same movie? The faceless bear that screamed like a woman being murdered was one of the most tense scenes in a 'horror' film in years. Also, the dance with the alien creature at the end that resulted in the alien creature creepily crushing it's body on top of Natalie Portmans was equally unsettling and tension filled.

>The villain is ultimately not scary and easily manipulated.

... There is no villain in this movie

>Save for Portman, the expedition characters are more irritating than interesting.

The point of the movie was to watch the characters break. I'm sorry seeing broken people break further is irritating to you... I'm sure they didn't find it particularly enjoyable either.


>Their rifles have 100 round magazines.

They use their rifles twice and the one time you're referencing is for dramatic affect to show the difference between the rest of the team and Portman's character.

Why is some half-assed assertion that self-destruction is written into our DNA, the theme the movie seems to anchor itself to, constantly dismissed like how one of the characters just gets obliterated by a bear or how the nature of the alien is to simply spread itself through self-preservation and replication?

These aren't the kind of questions I wanted to be asking myself after leaving this film, but there are so many thematic discrepancies and juvenile plot points. Lena enters an alien world because she's guilty, and her husband went in because he found out? A mysterious, encroaching alien threat and the two main characters enter because of a domestic dispute?

The idea of language changing your way of thinking is based on a real hypothesis, albeit an unproven one. The film took it to extreme lengths so it takes some suspension of disbelief but... hey, it's sci-fi! I got the impression Louise was kind of ""super charged"" in a way that the rest of humanity weren't, because she has a couple of leaps in knowledge and in her ability to communicate with the aliens, and both moments coincide with her being very physically close to them at in times when they needed her to progress faster. I thought they were sending some sort of psychic pulse to her which advanced her understanding and changed her perception of time beyond the level that a normal person learning the language would achieve. But yeah, if you're not on board with the idea of language rewiring your brain to alter your perception of time, then that's a tough hurdle to get over because the film hinges on that.

As for what kind of help the aliens need in 3000 years - I don't think it needs over-thinking, the film is careful to leave it completely unanswered - it doesn't matter what that help is, just that humanity works together *now* so we stick around. I don't think it necessarily has anything to do with technology advancement, intellect, or evolution. The idea that the aliens can ""control their own evolution"" is your own assumption and not hinted at by the film, so we really have no idea what help they need. The help humanity provides might be as simple as working together now, ending war, and preserving the planet's resources so there is something to share with the aliens in future. Maybe mankind *is* the resource and they need us to stick around to harvest our flesh (I don't think that's the reason but nothing's off the table!)

Exactly. Yes, I think technically it was person-Lena who exited, but she was just as affected by the shimmer. The doppelgänger was Lena too. It wasn't some alien that looked like her, it was cells building themselves based on the information from her DNA. Not-Kane (or doppelganger Kane) is the Kane that exited the Shimmer, but Lena doesn't care because she knows it's just as much him as the real-Kane that would have exited... maybe even more so!",7zqsdy

Also, it would be an odd plot hole to not show us the real Ventress if it is supposed to be her clone down there.",7zqsdy
dwdf5it,"This helped it click for me. I assumed the 'blob' was already there, like it was the thing that landed from outerspace, and that it tried to duplicate Ventress like it ends up duplicating Lena. But really, the real Ventress just mutated to the point that she destructed down into the 'blob' which then took on Lena's form after getting a bit of DNA from her. This seems obvious now when she explains 'Annihilation' and how it wants to break down human cells into the smallest bits (which I guess is what the blob is). So I guess Kane's clone was also originally one of his squad mates that broke down like Ventress and then got some of Kane's DNA?",7zqsdy

Execution was incredibly slow paced, monotone, and dumbed down. Most of the dialogue is very generic, ""You go that way, watch your backs"" squad stuff.

Every time there was an opportunity to dive deep, it asked questions like, ""Why are you doing this?"" ""Why are you doing this for your husband?"" Etc.

The answers to those questions were very unsatisfying, and interrupted by boring gore and violence. The visuals at the end were cool, but once it again it was so abstract it felt like they couldn't think of a way to visualize it. So they just have shit fly out of her mouth and turn the final act into a musical driven sequence. (Nothing wrong with the lighthouse stuff, it just was too little too late)

The first encounter with an animal was fine, but they should have increased the bizarre going forward. Increased the tension with some clever scenarios.

None of it felt very thought out, just generic horror moments. I understand for some people this might be enough, but I wanted to see something fresh and new. It came close but ended up being too much for even the filmmakers to juggle.

I wrote in another comment that, for example, they could have simply scattered the inside of the shimmer with three years worth of failed attempts, rather than the single camp. Crashed helicopters, drones, vehicles, hardware. A skeleton just inside the shimmer at the end of a rope leading out of it, for instance, would have raised more questions but would have at least explained that ""well, there's a reason for that"".

BOOK SPOILERS BOOK SPOILERS.

First book. Kane is definitely a duplicate and defintely dies. Natalie Portman's character back at Southern Reach is also a duplicate. The version in the shimmer continues to explore and mutate accepting that she can never leave and will die a weird gruesome death. The shimmer itself is largely unnafected by all the puny attempts of humans to rationalise it. Southern Reach is revealed to be a pretty terrible, paranoid and shambolic organisation. Second book. We see more of Southern Reach and see how it's falling apart from frustration and fear. The weirdness of Area X engulfs the base. Book 3. History and origin of Area X. It's purpose is kinda revealed. Another, unofficial mission into Area X with the biologist's clone and a new guy from book 2. While they're in Area X, the border expands rapidly to unknown size, possibly engulfing whole cities or even the world.

dvmrahc,"My tin foil hat theory is that Kane was deliberately created to serve as a sort of ambassador to the humans. Unfortunately, things created in the shimmer need the shimmer's unique atmosphere/ecosystem/effect to survive, so he started dying not long after leaving.

So the shimmer tries to create its human again during the final confrontation with Lena in the lighthouse, but that one is too perfect, having absorbed her human drive toward self-destruction.

This, of course, is just a wild guess and not really something the movie spells out, but it would explain why Kane was able to leave and why the shimmer went to the trouble of creating something that appears to be a copy when it's usually all about biological mashups.",7zqsdy

It was so easy for the director to simply create a back story where all these 4 characters had reasons to enter the shimmer ""under the radar"": one searching for the lost husband etc. and this setting would effectively wipe out any scientific and logic expectations - at least for me. 

I can understand that 4 ""civilians"" can make a series of strategic errors in their quest to the lighthouse and in these conditions I could focus just on the characters as humans instead of being pretty much brain-raped throughout the movie by their total lack of strategy, logic, drive and scientific errors.

For me, such a story (alien invasion and all characters totally useless except for the cheating couple) is simply overkill if not straight ridiculous given the main theme of the movie: two lovers, one cheated the other, in the end love wins, they were back together but they are not going to be the same person as before aka the shimmer in their eyes.",7zqsdy

dv1vccp,"I'm not talking about the scene as a whole I'm referring to the dialogue between the women. 

Example: they're going through the food and one girl mentions how ""tasty"" everything looks with sarcasm. It's a good line, and the director unfortunately was locked into the way he imagined the words being said as he wrote it.

 A good director will guide an actor to where they want it, but not necessarily lock them into ""playing the mood."" It's spooky and suspenseful whether or not the characters are playing spooky and suspenseful. The mainstream audience refers to this as ""over acting"" or ""under acting."" But that's actually what it is. 

The most glaring of this wasn't even dialogue. It's when Lena leaves her bag on the beach after deciding to pose there for a bit. It doesn't really change anything whether she brings her bag or not, but it'd obvious the director was DIRECTING the scene to be ""the end of the road"" because he knows it's the end of the road. If Lena was an actual human person she would have probably more than likely taken her bag. And if she didn't want to take her bag we needed more information. But because it's not an important aspect of the story it doesn't matter in the long run, but that's the difference between good and bad directon.

First of all, it doesn't make any of the characters any less narrow or unenjoyable, or any of the dialogue less dense. Just as important, it remains a huge plot hole. The doctor is a psychologist working for the government. The idea that she had the authority to choose these people and give them the knplwdge of and then thr access to the most classified thing going on (probably ever) is just too far of a stretch.

This was doubled down on when they were all given firearms, which only one character (Natalie Portman) knew how to use. None of them received any training on how to shoot?

Mother! wasn't a senseless allegory, it's a self-indulgent film about the director's creative works and their impact on his relationships.

>the movie is about self-destruction, and it explores this theme through the use of the aesthetics of the Cosmic Horror genre - which focuses on humans facing the unknown, unknowable, incomprehensible - in the spirit of Lovecraft.

It doesn't explore it though, it just touches on the surface and goes no where. There is no depth to the self-destruction angle. I mean I get it, it's about death and our responses to it. Alien Kane and Lena mix themselves with the other and continue through having children. 

If it's an allegory for man's battle with cancer what's the allegory? One very shallow character had cancer, died and they mentioned cancer a few times. It doesn't observe or say anything with an ounce of depth on the topic. The Fountain is a much better film about the grief and destruction of cancer.

When people call movies ""pretentious"" - this is kind of what they mean -- shallow crap that people try to pin depth on. I enjoy plenty of artsy films, this isn't. There is no journey for the mind unless you've not seen many other films in which case it might seem fresher than it is.",7zqsdy

What I came up with was PTSD - but like I said earlier, I believe anyone could see anything they expect. Here's my reasoning:

Both Kane and Lena are military. Even during their romp in bed Kane jokes about country and flag.
Kane comes back a different person, he's disoriented and has no memory (of course we find out why later). He recognizes Lena but is otherwise completely detached.

Entering the shimmer completely changes you so that, as Dr. Ventress says, the person who starts the mission is not the same person who ends it.

Everything about a soldier becomes fragmented, the mind comes undone. The allusion is spelled out in the movie: both body and mind unravel.

Refracting DNA (which I still think is beyond the pale) symbolizes the utter transformation into something/someone that's fundamentally different from who they were before.

War itself is the transforming mechanism and like the shimmer, it's not even sentient. It's just a part of (human) nature that transforms soldiers and even civilians and sometimes destroys them. 

One can see themselves as a mirror image but that image is at odds with who they are after the battle.

However, there's therories that if ETs see us going in the wrong direction they may have to intervene, like how this movie portrays in the start of it. So these 3 dimensional (humans on earth) enter the shimmer and they feel sick and confused because they are literally entering the 5th dimension but still with 3D setbacks (ego, judgement, labels, duality). They don't see the beauty of the new earth and what it could really be if your are a higher conscious person. I took the film as a more spiritual point of view.

The A2 and A4 were semi and three round burst.  The A2 also had a bunch of smaller modifications to allow the attachment of a M203 and a number of other tweaks, like the rifling in the barrel to support tracers.

I loved the movie and it's themes of self-destruction, change/mutation, marriage, etc. At the same time I like to try to figure out the science behind it even though it is Sci Fi so anything goes (in a way). Obviously a ""prism"" that causes DNA mutations, thoughts to become manifested physically, etc are fiction but there is some science underneath the fiction (extrapolated).

I agree with everything else in your post, but what I got from this wasn't that she was lying. She was essentially describing the way our own biological sphere on earth developed. Whatever carbon based matter that crashed onto earth and seeded our planet as we know it was being replaced by a new alien biomatter. 

So similar to how in reality the first single celled organisms did not intend to destroy earth, or really, have any intentions at all, neither does this. It simply *is*. I don't think we really even know if there was any single sentient being at all, or if closer to the center things just mutate so quickly that it manifests itself in what we see. ",7zqsdy

If the military didn't return that's all the more reason to send in even heavier armed troops as there clearly is something in there that makes them dissappear.

I mean the entire thing is killed with a phosphorus grenade (BTW completely not how a phosphorus grenade works). All the other animals died by gunfire. Clearly it's very effective. 

When you camp in a guard tower. High up, single acces point. Smart place. You don't put the guard in the middle of a field..

You put them at the stairs.

In a scenario like this, nobody goes looking alone. Even if you don't want to you move in pairs. That's survival 101. 

The movie was completely illogical in its execution. It's a military run operation but there arent any troops to be found. The person who calls the shots for 3 years goes on the expedition herself?

The first human cancer virus wasn't discovered until the 1960s, more than 50 years ago. We still have a lot to learn about cancer as we are just scratching the surface in trying to find a reliable cure.

""No, it's too late to move. We're staying here for tonight.""

She doesn't have to yell at anyone or anything but it seriously sounded like ""We're staying here for tonight... but if anybody pushes me further on it I'll roll right over.""

Yes, the scenes do. I pointed that out. I know what each scene means and I know the importance of them. You kind of wasted your time explaining shit I already know. But again, like I said, they do not provide interesting character. There just isn't anything special about them. They can be played by anyone. I mean I guess you can argue keeping every character generic can mean the audience can put themselves in their shoes, but it just doesn't work here if that was the point. Compare it to Dunkirk where it makes up for lack of character for spirit in the entire army and an intense experience. The type of experience that is lacking from Annihilation. 

>It seems a significant number of the people that disliked the film keep bringing up the genre of horror.

Probably because of the scenes involving horror? I mean just because you have films involving relationships doesn't mean it can't be both a horror, adventure, suspense, thriller, sci-fi. You can most definitely do it all. But you can't just do it all without really focusing on a mood that can tied all themes together. Which the film didn't properly do. 

>The film is sci-fi--it's not Alien. Even your It Comes at Night reference seems out of place.

It doesn't have to be Alien. But you can't deny the similarities between Annihilation and Prometheus, in terms of going to a new world, there's a lot of awe and wow and then boom scary creature comes out and picks off the characters one by one. Except in Prometheus, you have this underlying dread throughout that keeps you on your toes and interested between scenes. In Annihilation, there isn't anything that is underlying that you can stick on to. 

And I pointed out It Comes At Night not because they're both sci-fi horror films, they clearly aren't. I pointed it out because the endings are similar. They're cerebral and cause discourse between viewers. The difference, like I pointed out, is that It Comes at Night sticks to a mood. While I hated the ending to it and didn't enjoy the point, I did enjoy the experience that came with it. The opposite comes for Annihilation. I enjoyed the point and loved to think about it, but the experience throughout just wasn't as good as it should have been. 

>Regarding your feelings of emotionless throughout the film, I think it just isn't your type of film. You're supposed to be pondering philosophical issues, not waiting for the next monster to appear.

Jesus christ, dude. I knew exactly what this film wanted to be. I went in expecting slow, philosophical shit. 

And don't tell me what kind of film I like. I fucking love shit like 2001 and Blade Runner. Which are a lot fucking slower and provide a lot more time for you to be ""pondering philosophical issues."" See, the difference between 2001 and Annihilation isn't their themes and ideas. It's the fact that one is a great film that stuck to an emotion and mood, and the other was all over the place unsure of exactly what kind of film it wanted to be. That's why Annihilation isn't a great movie. It's perfectly fine. But it needed to stick to fucking any kind of mood it wanted to cover not bounce around. You keep thinking I wanted more monsters or some shit, when all I wanted was for the film to stick to a mood and provided films that have done similar things as examples of why they succeeded in that department. I showed examples this film should have followed. It didn't need to focus on horror. It could have focused on the relationship. Make the audience feel the guilt she feels instead of just showing her that she feels guilty. That or just focus on the wonder. Anything. But it didn't. It bounced around thinking it could cover everything but ended up covering very little. And that's why this film isn't that good. It's disappointing as hell. 

Not to mention the dialogue is still fucking trash. ",7zqsdy

But the only being we saw was that object, entity which/who is actually based on a mathematical representation of a formula or something. It was stated in an interview. So maybe it's not even alive. Maybe it's just a technology or a phenomenon, just like the shimmer itself.

Like, the whole thing felt like another big bang. It is theorized that life can come from outer space on comets or meteors, and this is exactly what happens at the start of the movie. So perhaps this is an evolutionary event, a creation event, something that isn't alive, but definitely caused a new form of life to be born. A new existence/world.",7zqsdy

Also, I never thought about how the Kane clone might just be an exact copy of Kane in a way.

You gotta keep in mind after watching that video of Kane carving that guy up, though, that he looked absolutely insane when he was doing that, and that was BEFORE he was cloned.

Compare that to the very muted gunfire sounds from [the Annihilation trailer](https://youtu.be/89OP78l9oF0?t=91) and hopefully you'll see a difference.

One of the concepts the film explores and it is explained early on, is cancer. Think of the meteor as a virus invading the Earth. The shimmer is expanding just as a cancerous cell growth expands throughout the body.

The earliest human knowledge of cancer dates back to ancient Egypt. The first human cancer virus wasn't discovered until the 1960s, more than 50 years ago. Cancer has been known for years so how come no one has figured out a reliable cure?

In simple terms, the film explores humanity's need to self-destruct. I would like to explain it further but I already posted my analysis earlier on.

Another commenter in here mentions the grenade part. He says that the alien was simply mimicking Lena's actions the entire time. When Lena placed the grenade in their hands, it did not know what a grenade was or how it functioned. This is why she was able to run away. Once she ran out of the lighthouse, it went back to it's blank form. It was looking for something to mimic and touched Kane's body. It felt how Kane was burned to ashes and then the rest of light house caught on fire. Knowing what burning to ashes is now, the alien died as well as everything around it. They even mention that the team that arrived to the lighthouse found nothing but ashes.

The cancer cells likely would have made it more ""powerful"" or maybe a more accurate phrase is simply more biodiverse.

It took on aspects of the fire from the grenade, but it didn't seem to have any reaction to it other than ""cool, gots fire hands now"".

Thematically, taking on Lena's human self-destructive nature makes the most sense as to why everything turned to ash. But why is Lena special in this sense? She's not the first self-destructive human it came in contact with.

Her eyes are changing colour as if the entity would trying to adapt to the environment. When she realized Kane killed himself she had an expression of genuine shock and disgust. Would she welcome this entity that took her husband with open arms?

They're not sure what they are, but Kane definitely isn't Kane, at least physically. Whether the entity replicated his mind or he somehow lives on in the entity, Kane still ended his life with the grenade.

Lena could either be the entity entirely, it could have somehow swapped bodies with her or simply overtook her mind in an effort to survive.

I'd like to think the entity spared Lena, but she was planning to kill it. It reacts how she does, she hit it with the tripod and it punched back. She made it open a grenade on itself, therefor killing it. The entity killed her in return?

Going into tin foil hat territory, but also the most chilling conclusion: As the lighthouse burns, Lena is the one trapped in the entity's body. By trying to kill it, she killed herself.

The framing and filming of the final encounter between Lena and the... entity... makes it easy to keep track of which one is the original her and which one is the ""clone"" Lena. That seems particularly intentional: filming such a scene in such a way doesn't happen by accident.

Honestly, if you perceive this movie as shallow you should avoid the book at all costs. The book is much more ambiguous. The characters don't even have names.

This is art. Like a painting or a song, it gives you things to think about but doesn't tell you what to think. If you're the type that needs question answered, I recommend staying away from anything by Lynch, Lost, The Leftovers, X Files, 2001, Tarkovsky, Donnie Darko, and so much more.

There was nothing they did where that mattered on screen. They have this varied crew of varied talents and none of them come into play. Characters? This movie had none.

I've heard of this atoning for guilt plot. Its completely weak and lacking foundation. So what was Lena's motivation? Her love for her husband who leaves her suddenly and she presumes is dead? Or her need to correct for her adultery? That she betrayed Kane and now she has to save his life for it? Please. You'll probably say ""Its both, she goes into the shimmer because she has to for herself and for Kane"". That's weak and poorly written.

>Lena is the only one the responds to dangerous situations competently so your comment that she acts untrained also makes no sense.

Really? She failed to assess the threat the alligator or crocodile posed to the group and fired at the last moment and then failed to adequately react to the fence being broken. I mean the group knew there was a threat since Kanes group set up a patrol yet she lets the situation go uncontrolled and ends with Shepherd being killed. Shepherd being killed is then used to set up a scene for a mourning Lena so there's another presentation of guilty Lena being spoon fed to the viewer.

The psychologist was more driven to getting answers than Lena who had all this set up for her.

>This is literally the definition of a three act structure.

You are playing loose and fast with the definition of the three act structure. The acts need to connect to each other to reach the climax but the movie has nothing connecting the acts to each other. First act sets up the world but nothing from it was useful to the conclusion. Second act is the rising action and again nothing from it was useful to the conclusion. It was a lot of foreshadowing of course but the third act is ham fisted and is naked to the eye with what was going on in the shimmer. The third act exists on its own, self contained, and that is not how the three act structure works.

You can super cut the movie showing Lena walking through the forest, alone, to the beach, to the lighthouse, its events and then end the short movie as its own stand alone movie. Those other people, those other events in the movie didn't matter at all in the end. They were put into the movie as filler.

Strange alien land that the protagonists must explore that mimics whatever is currently ailing the souls or psyches of the protagonists is a trope of science fiction.

Roadside Picnic is an old Soviet science fiction book that was made into the film Stalker. Annihilation has almost the exact same story.

The film was OK, but it gets on my nerves the way r/movies discusses film writers & directors like they are discussing the writings of God. It's just the scribblings of a second rate writer reshuffling some old sci-fi tropes. If Alex Garland was really a serious writer he would be writing books or higher end comic books. As it is, he has made one very good science fiction film and one mediocre science fiction film but r/movies talks about him like he is Aldous Huxley or something. ",7zqsdy

dvxy4a5,"> I wouldn't say the ending was a cliche. If you paid attention in the opening scenes they did show a meteor and crashing into the lighthouse - it was clear from the beginning that something from outer space is causing the shutter.

I know it was aliens. Hell, you know that from the trailers alone. 

> In fact, I'd say it would have been much more of a cliche if Alex Garland made the aliens explicitly evil and seeking conquest. Instead what we saw in the origin of the shutter was very ambiguous - it was almost as it wasn't an alien creature, but rather an alien ""law of nature"" that was introduced to earth's biology.

No, it was definitely an unconsciously evil alien. Just a virus. A cancer. It was quite literally space cancer. That happened to occasionally replace/seed humans. I've literally seen dozens of endings like this.

> Similarly, in Ex Machina a cliche ending would be a clear ""Happy Ending"" - having the main character kill the creator of the AIs, and all his creations and then walking away with explosions behind his back. Instead, you had the machine use the human, manipulate him and escape by showing both excellent understanding of both the objective (quantifiable) and the subjective (qualitative). 

So in your opinion ""evil, emotionless robot kills everyone"" isn't a cliche? I'll honestly tell you that for comparison, the biggest surprise for me in ""Interstellar"" was that the AI characters were stand-up guys, and not trying to sabotage or kill humans. A much better ending to Ex Machina would've been if the BlueFacebook dude actually managed to create a real AI, instead of a convincing fake.

dvb4zws,"That was *a* theme, it wasn’t *the* theme. 

An equally prominent theme is that whether something is good or evil, creating or destroying depends on your point of view. 

Cancer plays a prominent role in the film. As humans we look at cancer as a destroyer and anthropomorphise it with words like “evil” but cancer has no ill intent. As they say in the film, cancer doesn’t *want* anything it just exists and fulfills its biological function, to reproduce. 

The protagonists in the movie see the shimmer/area x the same way. It’s an invader. It’s destroying our world. It’s metastasizing and will eventually kill us. What does it want? Nothing, it just is. 

But what happens once the humans enter the shimmer? Suddenly they are the foreign invader, there to destroy and the “immune system” of area x kicks in in the form of shark alligators and bears that scream with human voices. 

Lena says at the end, “It didn’t attack me. It *copied* me. *I* attacked *it*.” Both sides were doing what their biology told them to. There was no good or evil, they just *were* and those imperatives couldn’t coexist. ",7zqsdy

When an alzabo eats a human it gains human-like sapience. It then feels the drive to hunt down the victim's loved ones so they can all ""live together"" within its mind.

Yes agree 100%, I came to the conclusion that depression is a lack of purpose (perceived or real) and this chimes with that, whereas happiness is more like peace of mind, neither purpose nor bliss are necessarily related to joy or sadness, and people need to understand that humans are much more complex than a joy-sad axis.",7zqsdy

durddlb,"Lots of stuff to take in.

For one, didn't know it was MULTIPLE books. That makes tons of sense.

1) I guess the movie just did a very poor job explaining any of this. I feel like you're doing fine because you read the book and could kind of fill in any blanks with the movie in your head, but for me a lot of it seemed illogical. They walked through, and then it seemed like they could just turn around whenever they want. I never was under the impression it was as confusing as it sounds. For example, maybe a scene where a scientist is told to walk in, tape for a few seconds, and turn around, and then they start walking in, with a team behind them waiting, and they take a few steps, a few steps more, a few steps more, they turn around and see the team, still not in yet, a few steps more, and then it cuts back out to the team waiting, hours later, and then back to the scientist, waking up on the forest floor. Like something to express ""this isn't as simple as it looks"". Because otherwise I never got that impression.

2) Hmm. I suppose this is a good way to look at it. I just wish they had sounded more confused then. They were so sure of themselves when they said ""refracting DNA"" that it sounded like it was an explanation for the audience.

3) Yeah I thought this too. I'm sure she's much more important feeling from a book perspective. In the movie she just felt like a shoe-horned source of inexplicable conflict.

4) I suppose that's an interesting take, but the idea of her being unreliable literally *never* came to me. I consider myself pretty good at thinking through and analyzing movies, but that concept seemed entirely lost. Even given she had an affair, it struck me as her being in a bad place and lonely. I'm also not sure what you mean about the first time Lena is shown to be unreliable in the chair scene. Did she lie about something? I always felt like she was being honest. The ending, especially given it was all shown visually and not with any of her speaking about it, felt like a true depiction.

dutn8gn,"Probably should say ahead of this, the genre can be polarizing.  There are not a lot of high budget AAA films in it, and many have mixed ratings because they do not follow the standard horror formula.  This is a pretty mixed list, but should keep it interesting.  If something's not to your taste, try something else.

* Pontypool - A *very* different existential horror.  Verbal transmission of the [Halting Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) for humans.  Protagonist starts out as a gruff asshole, but movie turned out to be worth the watch.
* Sphere - A team of scientists is sent to investigate something that should not exist at the bottom of the ocean.  What they find, and experience, is both the greatest discovery in the history of man, and one of the most nightmarish things conceivable.
* The Thing (1982) - Creature flick / potentially world-ending cataclysm rolled into one.  Classic.  Practical special effects have held up better than they have any right to.  1982 version is absolutely preferred.  Oh, and after watching it, [definitely read this.](http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/watts_01_10/)  It's short enough and worth your time.
* Banshee Chapter - What if the wrong drugs made some of the worst things in the universe notice you?  More on-screen monstrosities, includes heavy paranoia/conspiracy, and loads of jump scares.  The actual horror is more thematic than present in the plot.  This is the least slow-burn and has some of the least satisfying SFX.
* Coherence - A comet passing overhead breaks reality, and the attendees of a dinner party soon find that the same house and occupants (themselves) wait for them in every direction.
* The Corridor - Awkward social interactions even before insanity sets in, but the characters are driven to psychosis after discovering a place in the woods that unlocks a kind of telepathy in them. It's hard to watch some of their insanity.
* The Mothman Prophecies - Something pulls a reporter into a small midwest town outside his will.  According to some of the locals, he has already been there.  Subsequently, he is contacted repeatedly by an unknown entity and told of upcoming catastrophes all over the world, which he is powerless to stop.  As he tries to gather information and evidence of this entity, he is told of a tragedy in the selfsame town.  Bit of a romance + drama + we're dealing with shit outside our everyday universe that clearly has its own ends.

I hear Absentia and Resolution are pretty good but I haven't seen them, so I can't say if they fit.",7zqsdy

dus29sn,"The physicist said something about how Lena wanted to “fight it” and how she, the physicist, didn’t want that. Then she chose a peaceful death.

Of course, the physicist could have been wrong!

Edit: The mimic’s motivation came from Lena. She inherited a degree of Lena’s sensibilities and emotions. Fake-Kane knew enough to get back home and he states at the beginning that he “recognized Lena.” My working theory is that the mimics take a while to fully “become someone” (if they ever fully do).",7zqsdy
dus3k6t,"I think the sentience behind the shimmer knew it was successful therefore the lighthouse and further shimmer effect was not needed any more.

My thought on the overall Shimmer is it is kind of a Genesis Device- it will either work on the Sentient life on a planet/dimension or if there is no Sentience it morphs DNA or whatever to CREATE Sentience. IMO.",7zqsdy
duxdph2,"Primer - I love how open to interpretation all of this is. I don't think there is a ""right"" answer and I love how it lets you think and fill in what you think. The book was similar as it was often vague and forced you to fill in details. This also mirrors the shimmer as we/they never really understand what is going on or why.

I took it to be the same as said above. That the copies took on parts of the originals feelings and ideas. That's why copy-Kane is happy to see her at the end. He knows he doesn't know her but cares for he because og-Kane did. 

So when copy-Lena mimics her to be more like her it is getting her feelings, motivations, etc.

So when she tries to kill it I felt that it knew that she didn't really want to kill it but that she wanted to save her husband and make things better. So it in a basic way tries to do the same. It burns everything down and shows that it too loves Kane by touching his dead body.

I also believe that the whole thing was some sort of terraforming device that had no real sentience. It didn't care about anything it was just doing as it was designed. So copy-Lena shut it down because it knew that it was causing harm and as a machine-like device it didn't care if it lived or died.

Also at the end with the shimmer eyes, I took that just to show that they both had been permanently changed. Not that there was some secret plan, or new alien invasion coming, or anything like that. Just that they had been massively changed by the shimmer. Which could be an analogy for how they were permanently changed by her affair. There was a before and an after and they are forever changed by her self-destructive tendencies. ",7zqsdy
dvikkv0,"Maybe the mimic's motivation was her motivation, which once she realizes her husband blew himself up and it was his mimic that made it out, was likely at its peak.

I don’t think she was a clone in the end, but I don’t see why they would put that cut right in the middle of that continuous scene. Watch again and you will see how jarring this is.

She was absolutely a copy by the time we see her with the Ouroboros tattoo. Or, if not a copy, so radically changed that she was not what she was when she entered the shimmer.

Of the two Kanes we see in the lighthouse from the tripod camera, I don't believe either of them were the creature from the hole. If they were, the destruction of one or either would have led to the destruction of the crystal forest and the collapse of the shimmer. The creature that absorbed/engulfed the psychologist was the original object/creature/whatever that landed in the meteor strike and was what was causing the shimmer. The shimmer caused the various mutations and created the copies. Also, if copy-Kane were the ""core"" creature, or a piece of that creature, I believe his persisted existence would have kept the crystal forest and the shimmer active.

The Kane and Lena at the end of the film are either new creatures that have some amount of memories from the originals or they are the originals that have been changed so much that they cannot be said to be the same. At that point it's the Ship of Theseus paradox.",7zqsdy

Not really- not if the Plot doesn't rely on you knowing or not knowing these answers. You are not questioning whether changes occur inside, just how quickly they occur? Is that why a car is such a big deal to you? So what if they took a car? How is the Plot any different? They could still have a river they need to cross or a bear attack... or any of the events that happen. Cars break down. Helicopters crash. Why are you obsessed with transportation issues?

That to me is the dimwittedness at work. Did you see the visuals of  the shimmer? Did it not resemble a wall to you? Doesn't take a lot of effort for the viewer to think that the helicopters standing off at a distance cannot go in there.

Same thing for the all woman team...did you see what the all male team did? Seeing if there was a sex difference to the reactions of Area X makes perfect sense. How is this a Plot hole in any sense?

Pointing out issues with the way the plot was set up to get rolling isn't diminishing the message of the movie, it's just pointing out plot holes. Plot holes which, with just a little more exposition, could be explained away with in-universe evidence thus preventing the plot holes from ever existing.

Late to the party, but I think /u/DuhTrutho is going too soft on this movie.

Why couldn't they investigate the shimmer with robots?

Why couldn't they send in teams to go in progressively deeper or less deep into the shimmer, depending on how well the last mission went?

Why couldn't they send in drones operated with laser comms? If we can see into the shimmer, then we can send in laser signals into the shimmer.

Why couldn't they use lab dogs tied to a rope to investigate the shimmer?

If the shimmer was expanding more and more, why haven't they tried drone strikes? If all it took was a little fire, why wouldn't the military send in the heavy artillery to stop this existential threat?

Why would they keep on doing the same thing over and over again (just sending a team of suicidal people into the shimmer) knowing that it would get people killed without producing tangible results?

I spent the first hour of the movie thinking of so many different ways that the investigation of the shimmer could have been done \*competently\*. And for that reason, I hated this movie.

It's definitely the personification of trauma and if we knew what it wanted it couldn't fulfil that role storywise.

I think as a straightforward horror sci-fi it's not as successful overall actually. There are too many basic storytelling issues, loads of which are pointed out in other comments here so I can understand if people find it frustrating and/or outright confusing.

e3pgg8m,"You make some very good points for those movies & that's why they are considered classics. While Annihilation will never receive anywhere near the recognition those movies received, I still personally enjoyed the unpredictable loose structure and strangeness surrounding it for a change of pace. Wouldn't rush to watch it again but enjoyed it nonetheless. I think the biggest issue is that you're trying to make sense of a movie that I assume was never supposed to make sense (Inside the shimmer) but rather a strange ride that evoke your own theories.

""Because if you set your story in the real world, leaving aside your alien, you're bound by real-world plausibility, and the real world has very precise and well known rules.""   
I haven't watched Annihilation in quite some time but iirc the shimmer was basically it's own little world on our world. Everything was changing and supposed to be vastly different inside the shimmer, It was not supposed to be logical once inside.  
It's definitely a far cry from being too intelligent, it would require logical structure to be too intelligent lol.  
& I most certainly found it kind of silly sending in an inexperienced & under prepared group of only women but at the same time they put their hands up and considering they were unsure what else to do after having apparently tried everything, I just went with it.  
Overall my main point is that if you were to take all illogical things out of this particular movie, I imagine it would have either been a very bland flop of a movie or it wouldn't have made it past the 20 minute mark.  


Just out of curiosity, did you have any theories regarding the ending or not your cup of tea?

The meteorite was described to have given a bunch of things a sort of translucent, soapy color, which I'm sure is where Garland got the shimmer idea from. AFAIK there is no shimmer in the Annihilation book.

The story is totally different though. In *Colour* the narrator is like some kind of land prospector and he is responsible for planning out a water reservoir.

But after seeing a few of them, it became apparent that he is actually really quite humble, and possesses a certain purity in regards to his approach to film as an art form.

dx0s1wu,"> but there is still the crazy expanding border

I didn't really need an explanation for that one. Living things tend to spread - viruses, cancers, all the comparisons they used likened the shimmer to those things that have a tendency to spread.

>  their psyches being warped

I was under the impression that their minds were being affected by the DNA alteration happening to their brains, and that was causing a sort of functional dementia.

>  the formation of clones, the worm hole alien clone, etc that isn't explained by retracting DNA

Yeah, I kind of ""hand-waved"" those things as a form of mimicry that occurs naturally to some level in our world. There exist lifeforms that mimic others to survive. I also sort of saw the floating-light-cloning-thing as an alien form of primordial pool or omnipotent stem-cell culture, that took on the form of whatever it was exposed to. Stem cells are guided by chemical and physical interaction with the cells/environs around them, so that worked for me. Plus, it seemed like a good way for the alien organism to survive wherever it landed, to copy the organisms it encountered that already lived in that environment.

However, I don't understand why Kane first saw the primordial light orb (that then apparently become his clone), and then Lena saw the Shrink-lady explode into the what appeared to be the same or a very similar primordial light orb. Did one of Kane's comrades explode into an orb like the shrink? It seems more like Kane was alone once he got to the lighthouse, until his clone appeared.",7zqsdy

I thought about the girl with the plants growing out of her, and if I’m not mistaken, wasn’t she the one who supposedly cut herself and hid it with her sleeves? Maybe the cuts when trying to heal we’re creating plants or whatever instead. Also, I do remember her explanation as the radio waves and dna were getting refracted or something, like through a prism, but how do plants get the human structure dna or do they all have that ability and it’s just hidden?

Good science fiction has never been about the fictional science itself -- it's almost always about (the nature of) people. Interstellar and Inception are very straightforward to understand, and I think you're getting that confused with ""an intelligible plot."" That doesn't make them bad -- I love Interstellar and Inception -- but it's not the only way to present an idea. Under the Skin is similar to Annihilation in that sense -- it's severely underrated because it's not spoon-feeding you the messages and ideas it conveys, but it's a remarkable film when you can understand and appreciate it. 2001: A Space Odyssey also falls under the same category IMO, though thanks to time and online resources, people can properly appreciate it today.

Kane was gone for a full year on outside-time but from his point of view his expedition probably wasn't any longer than Lena's, and the battery isn't dead because there's probably very time between his suicide and Lena entering the shimmer.

The movie had underlying messages but they weren’t too much in your face. They were subtle and the sci-fi aspect was enjoyable and convincing rather than messed up and all over the place and justified by the “message”. 

And yeah, the government had a limited perspective. They were trying to measure it, to observe it, to calculate it, but they couldn’t and it still existed. They also immediately thought of it as an invasion and it wasn’t. Hell, even Lena herself told them that she wasn’t even sure if the “alien” knew she were there.

dvhtkzw,"Your point about two or three subtextual layers underneath each line of spoken dialogue is spot on. Each character's utterance is a snake's tail sticking out of the ground, waiting to be unearthed.

Best is when Ventress asks Josie if there was anything inside the hut. First level of analysis, she's simply asking whether anything interesting is inside. Deeper level of analysis, what does it mean when a psychologist asks you if there's anything interesting inside? Josie says, ""looks like it's been long abandoned."" And as soon as she finishes uttering the last syllable of that line, she's pulled in by an apex predator, a crocodile with mutations from sharks, in some sense, it's a meta-predator, in that it's been given aspects from other water predators of its type. It's a representation. She yells, ""it's got my bag!"" It's got her by her psychological baggage, and is trying to pull her into the depths of the waters of the hut. The metaphor extends to the following scene, when they inspect the crocodile's mouth.

The camera is inside the crocodile's mouth looking out, and as the mouth is being opened, the first person we see, as she sits and looks in, is Ventress. The psychologist, as a profession, makes it her duty to look inside the animal that emerges from under the surface of consciousness. After Anya says that it's getting too heavy, we revert to the scene's opening shot and the mouth snaps shut as Ventress continues looking in.

This movie is incredibly deliberate. Every utterance, every thoughtless decision by a character, every action, reveals who the character is, e.g. Anya refusing to look into the crocodile's mouth as she holds it open. Her complaining about holding the mouth open, saying ""it's getting heavy,"" instead of ""I'm getting tired."" Cass's (short for Cassandra) long talk with a distant Lena as they row over the surface of the waters (read: consciousness), which were just revealed to house mutant crocodiles (meta-predators lurking in your mind), towards the old southern reach base. Here, Cass prophecies each of the characters' deaths, and we can link her utterances here to what Carl Jung wrote about his ""spectral Cassandra's."" 

This goes on and on, and the movie drops all pretense that this is a ""normal"" story by the third act, just like drilling underneath your surface personality as you get closer to who you actually are becomes more mysterious to onlookers, passersby, the faceless crowd. The entire movie is a dramatic representation of psychological theory, Jung's in particular, I think. This is probably why literal, objective interpretations come up short or are disatisfying. It requires a lot of legwork and analytical effort on the viewer's part. You must engage with it, rather than lean back in your chair and let it explain itself to you.

to me i just couldn't help compare it to Ex Machina's ending, where you know the central question/struggle between the characters - is she really alive or just pretending to be? is she a friend or is she faking it to get what she wants? these were questions that were set up, and the suspense and shock of the ending drew from those questions.

in Annihilation, I didn't have questions like that about the nature of the creature at the end because i didn't understand anything about it. i didn't understand the ""rules"" it was operating with, and i didn't have an idea of the potential outcomes because it was just confusing.

i'm not saying it's a bad movie, just that the ending fell flat for me because these questions weren't developed enough. it was one of those movies where i was like ""this kinda neat, i bet if i read an analysis by someone smarter than me i'll get it"". that makes for the actual experience of watching the ending to be less engaging because at that point i'd lost all hope of figuring it out for myself based on what had happened so far.",7zqsdy

The actors have pointed out that each character is flawed in a way that would lead to them wishing for self destruction- guilt over a failed marriage or loss of a child or serious addiction issues is at play here and the literal transformation of each person.

e38du89,"> for the vague utopian aspirations of the Left generally. ""Hey we don't know where all this radical critique is going to get us, other than destroying stable human social structures that have lasted for thousands of years, but we're kinda-sorta sure it's going to be great! Look, shiny objects! Rainbows! Imagine!""

That's not at all how much of the left looks at things and people like Karl Marx went through great lengths to critique idealism and Utopian beliefs. It's why communist follow the philosophy of ""dialectical materialism"" opposed to the various idealist philosophies liberalism and anarchism follow. 

The whole point of dialectical materialism is to scientifically observe social structures and society and then figure out what changes need to be made and how to make those changes to achieve an outcome in society. This is why communist governments will often do things that contradict the idea of communism itself (stateless, classless, moneyless society where private property is abolished and the means of production are shared). A communist isn't an idealist and knows you can't just dismantle (or attempt to dismantle) every social structure Humanity developed and hope for the best. That's Utopian idealism. Instead they try to figure out what changes need to be made to the Human condition to make society move towards that outcome. 

So you're comment may capture the idealist Utopian thoughts of certain elements of the left, it certainly doesn't capture the most common radical form of leftism's (communism) thoughts on society. 

As an end this isn't a communism vs capitalism argument so you can keep your classic ""muh 100 million deaths"" to yourself. It's just pointing out that there's large elements of the left that reject Utopian beliefs and idealism in favor of cold hard scientific dialectical materialism.",7zqsdy

2. They encounter a building with a spiral staircase leading down into the ground, which the biologist inexplicably can't think of as anything but a tower.
3. Upon entering the 'tower', they discover writing on the wall created from biological material that blooms into a bizarre mixture of different plant species like the plants in the film. The writing is one endless run-on sentence, that begins with ""“Where lies the strangling fruit that came from the hand of the sinner I shall bring forth the seeds of the dead to share with the worms that gather in the darkness and surround the world with the power of their lives while from the dimlit halls of other places forms that never were and never could be""

ive never seen someone do it wrong this way before",7zqsdy
dw5hfbh,"Evidence to support her being a duplicate:

We see all over the movie that things are being duplicated. From very basic and remedial things, like form in flowers or a human voice, to full scale clonings such as Cane. When Cane has been duplicated, his memories of his immediate past are damaged, but he can still remember Lena. 

I'd argue that when our characters wake up with their memories lost, those are all duplicates. We embody their perspective, but it's why they are like Cane; muddled and disoriented. 

Notedly, the tattoo that Lena eventually gains is present on Anya, but not during the alligator scene. It's somewhere between there and her tying up of our crew that Anya gains the eight tattoo, which was present on the arm of the man with eels for intestines in the video. 

We don't actually see any instance of mutation on screen. That's what character say has happened, but all we actually see with out own eyes is the duplication. Sure, you can infer that there is independent mutation happening as well, but everything is explainable with reduplication with the duplicates being altered; which is how biology actually works, by the way. Typically, mutation isn't a cell changing. It's a cell being copied wrong. 

Either way, it's much of a muchness. The film wants to make it clear that the woman who started the mission isn't the woman who ended it. Whether that's because she mutates magically via alien rainbows or because the process we see on screen occurs to her is pretty irrelevant.

More evidence, by the way; we see Lena doesn't have the tattoo until the double strikes her unconscious. When she wakes up, she has it now. Maybe the double inked her in her sleep. Of maybe the reason we got two breaks in lucidity in that scene was to play with the idea that when Lena wakes up, it's not the Lena we've grown accustomed to.",7zqsdy
dvoei38,"Wow, my impression was very different. After watching the movie I was pretty sure that she was an alien/copy from the first second onwards. I think that she has already reached the lighthouse and returneded as a copy when we first meet her. Maybe the cancer means that something went wrong during the copy process, so she wants to go back ans fix it.

Or she is installed by the alien to make sure only ""suitable"" people are sent into the shimmer.

Either way, I don't think that she is ever human or her original version in the movie. It would also explain why she annihilates in the lighthouse and the thing she becomes instantly makes another copy of Lena.

People have weaknesses.  How does that make us self-destructive - voluntarily or involuntarily?  There isn't exactly a path where one can follow that avoids the fate of death.  All of us will eventually die.  That's biology, not human failure. 

> Now, I believe that the movie is not only about self-destruction but also about self-destruction and it's innate tendency in humanity, and overcoming it.

This is the usual theme of most movies.  It creates the story where the protagonist must overcome his obstacles including the ones in his head.  But I'd hardly conclude that the characters in Annihilation succumbed (died) as a result of their own innate self-destructiveness (knowingly or unknowingly).  What was the innate self-destructiveness in the alligator, deer, bear or plants that led to their demise?  We're just animals too.  

> So I think it's pretty clear that everyone involved, especially having known that no other team has returned, understand they are probably going to die.

No, they knew there was a huge risk of dying.  Doesn't mean they had a death wish.  In real life, some people assume those life-threatening risks in their occupation where they weighed the risks against their own desires.

This is also a little ambiguous, but I'm pretty sure the sex scene we actually see on-screen happens after Kane leaves for the shimmer. I personally think that she ended the affair six months after Kane disappeared as she was finally starting to suspect that Kane discovered the affair. So the timeline is as follows.

Kane deploys to middle
Lena begins affair
Kane discovers affair
Kane leaves
Lena continues affair for 6 months
Lena begins to suspect Kane discovered the affair
Lena ends the affair

It's the results of a virus/disease carried by the meteorite... and that ""lair"" just happens to be the epicentre. It isn't malicious or evil, it doesn't have a plan to survive, it just does what it does - and that's refract/corrupt/replicate/destroy & create using matter around it. Is it really Ventress that Lena finds under the lighthouse in an advanced stage of mutation? Or is it a creation made by Area X that has adopted Ventress's form? I'm leaning towards one of those rather than it being an alien in the usual sense. I don't think it's ""consciously"" trying to replicate humans in an effort to survive out in the real world, but just mutating and adapting and doing what it does. One of the results of that is doppelgangers (like the Kane who returns home) and another is ""infecting"" Lena somehow and becoming part of her even after the rest of Area X is destroyed.

The film, thematically, is about the human tendency to annihilate. Every character grapples with this issue to some degree; in fact, it's the key component of most of them. In this film, we see how this tendency has caused some horrific unhappiness for our main characters, and directly jeapordised the mission at hand, but it is this human tendency, that, when copied by the mimic, eventually saves humanity as the mimic immolates itself.

That, and it has a lot it would like the audience to think about self. We don't see one character throughout this film, that's obvious from the clues hidden throughout. The Lena at the end isn't the first Lena, she's probably not even in the top ten. But how much does it matter, exactly?

When we watch these two people who don't know each other, but have intense and personal memories together at the end, and the film asks us 'How is this going to go? How can they relate to each other? Do they still love each other?'

I’ll have to watch it a second time to look into that but that’s how I interpreted it.

The second book shifts gears pretty abruptly and instead of following the biologist you follow a Southern Reach director ( newly appointed) and his struggles with interviewing the returned Biologist and Area X's growth. It's more of a spy novel than sci fi

The addict character got into her head that everyone else had been going crazy, and so inevitably she went crazy. The self-harming character just decided to give into the shimmer, and rapidly began changing. The leader of the group was determined to get to the lighthouse at all costs and did do that, but died/annihilated herself soon after.

The point of the affair is that it actually happened well before the Shimmer even landed on earth. Kane found out about it. That's why he decided to go on the mission knowing it was probably suicide. As mentioned in the film, everyone who goes into the Shimmer is damaged somehow and for Kane it was discovering the affair.

Again, Lovecraft was an author, and authors need narrative. I don't think the fear for him was in knowing that there are unknowables, but being *Presented* with one and experiencing a sort of death because of it. 

But yeah, the book ending has Lena giving up on basically everything she thought she knew and setting out to achieve a new understanding. Which is where I think her story should end. 

But trilogies are all the rage and Vandameer needs to pay his rent. 

*And yeah, I love Lovefract for having more well carved out what cosmic horror is, but part of the LARP'ing for that is being aware that it is fundamentally and purposefully, wholly unknowable. ",7zqsdy
dv8a4a3,"Perfect!

I really appreciate feeling like someone else is trying to talk about the film and not justify their speculations [""It was all a fabrication because Lena was called a liar!""].

Reyna was spot on an attempt to demonstrate cosmic horror for the audience. You either accept what you've seen that breaks your reality, or you deny it. Either way, you're going to have to work through this new perspective. 

I want to say it broke Renya, but she ended up coming to the rescue, so as far as classic Lovecraft goes, she's a hero character. 

Lena, however, you nailed it again. They say once or twice, or at least imply, that Area X gives you want you want [the book backs this up]. In so far as it has some psychic properties. 

What does Lena want? To affect change and progress, to grow and learn, to fix something she broke, to save her husband that she feels [rightfully so] responsible for pushing away. 

Does she get what she wants? I think she does. She kills her mimic [I'm trying to get mimic to catch on, seems thematically appropriate] which means she has conquered the self, the self-destructive [LITERALLY] part of her that she hated, that was causing her pain. 

I LOVE your take on the light grenade, I didn't pick up on that. Kudos! 

If there is a sequel, I'm interested in seeing where Lena goes next, what her new purpose is. Rebuild a life with Kane? Seek out a better understanding of what happened? Learn more about her new biological composition? 

I like what you said about the Doctor, but she got what she wanted didn't she? She was dying of cancer and was obsessed with knowing a more accurate 'truth' of Area X than anyone else [since that was her job] and at the end, she BECOMES the most fundamental representation of Area X that we see. So I think she got what she wanted as well. 

Everyone kind of gets what they want in Area X, one way or another. ",7zqsdy

Just after Josie walks off and becomes a plant person, we have a scene of Lena freaking out and doubled over, desperately sobbing, before she picks herself back up and goes to the lighthouse. The tattoo is there in that scene at the very least. It probably showed up even earlier. 

The soldier could have been a clone or he could have been the real deal. The paramedic was talking about how here fingerprints were moving, and Kane had the line about how flesh was like water now. They were all changing.

They might have carved him open because they didn't feel any guilt for slicing up a fake or maybe they were cutting him up because it was the only way to prove what they all suspected and he had already resigned himself to never getting out alive. ",7zqsdy

Especially in his articulation of the archetypal Shadow. This is a perfect example of that. 

Freud's Unheimlich, from wikipedia: ""What interests us most in this long extract is to find that among its different shades of meaning the word heimlich exhibits one which is identical with its opposite, unheimlich. What is heimlich thus comes to be unheimlich. [...] In general we are reminded that the word heimlich is not unambiguous, but belongs to two sets of ideas, which, without being contradictory, are yet very different: on the one hand it means what is familiar and agreeable, and on the other, what is concealed and kept out of sight. Unheimlich is customarily used, we are told, as the contrary only of the first signification of heimlich, and not of the second. [...] On the other hand, we notice that Schelling says something which throws quite a new light on the concept of the Unheimlich, for which we were certainly not prepared. According to him, everything is unheimlich that ought to have remained secret and hidden but has come to light.""

Basically, in case you don't have the full time to read the article, it was never going to be a strict adaption of the book; while I understand how insanely disappointing that would be, like back when I wanted a full adaption of A Series Of Unfortunate Events, but instead I got that strange distillation Jim Carrey version, I was super disappointed, but looking on it in the realms of just a regular, weird, zany kids movie, it wasn't the worst

Which isn't to say this movie isn't the worst, I think it's one of the best I've seen in theaters, but to each their own; I just think it's easier to form an objective opinion of the movie knowing this about the director and his vision, as annoying as it might be to have to know something about the movie and it's director going into it (Although, I mean, it's also same to say I feel about reading the book beforehand, a task that takes up infinitely more time than the cursory Google search I had with Alex Garland / Annihilation adaption)",7zqsdy

Having integrated her shadow in the lighthouse, Lena emerges from the her endeavor marked by the symbol which stands for she who ""constitutes the secret of the prima materia,"" that which ""unquestionably stems from man's unconscious."" We could abstract the mutation in her DNA--specifically the mutation, whatever that process is, perhaps the alien itself--to be the ""prima materia."" 

This is just from Google, the definition of prima materia: ""a formless primeval substance regarded as the original material of the universe."" By the by, this seems to me to be a pretty good physical description, if that's even possible, of the alien in the depths, in its pure form.

And here's a link to it's alchemical relevance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_materia

And a glimpse into the link, ""They [the alchemists, I'm guessing] have compared the ""prima materia"" to everything, to male and female, to the hermaphroditic monster, to heaven and earth, to body and spirit, chaos, microcosm, and the confused mass; it contains in itself all colors and potentially all metals; there is nothing more wonderful in the world, for it begets itself, conceives itself, and gives birth to itself.""

But I'm left wondering, if we're willing to go with this understanding of the Ouroboros mark, what is the significance of the Ouroboros travelling from person to person? In terms of the narrative, why are we allowed to notice it on say, Anya, at one moment, the soldier at another moment? What is being said about those characters?

dvlpf7x,"Take whatever I have to say with a grain of salt. I'm not going to sit here and pretend that I got 100% of the movie on the first watch. I'll definitely come back to this.

That being said, the shimmer seems to be some kind of alien lifeform or program. The ""program"" causes mutation. One is a symptom of the other. 

There were two Kanes there, yeah -- the bearded, unkempt looking one who blows himself away and the calm one with slicked back hair who steps into frame at the end. I believe it was the ""original"" Kane that detonated the grenade in the lighthouse. It's hard to say because things get so muddled in the shimmer, but the Kane who shows up at the start of the movie had his hair slicked back like the second Kane in the video. My guess is that the copy Kane was the shimmer's first stab at producing a ""perfect"" copy that would allow it to better understand/interface with the outside world, and it tried again with Lena at the end. 

I think it's the copy of Kane and the ""real"" Lena in the end, but one of the main themes of the movie is change. Cass has the line about burying her daughter as being two bereavements -- losing her daughter and losing her old self. Kane and Lena have been so changed by their experiences in the shimmer that it doesn't really matter if they are ""real"" or ""fake"" anymore. ",7zqsdy
dvlpx2e,"I think it's down to perception. 

It's not a weird alien creature purposefully trying to become human as such... it was a replica, potentially not even intentional. Possibly a side effect of the mutation and prism. It's all part of the same thing - the anomaly in the light house, which causes cell mutation and creation. 

Real Kane killed himself as he couldn't process what he was becoming. Don't forget, he was potentially in there for a long time before getting to the light house. Goodness knows what he went through - the team were may be there for a third of the time as we saw the short affects on them (physical changes, dementia etc). 

I took it to be  that the replica of Lena was killed - it absorbed and replicated her perfectly, including her self destructive tendencies. The real Lena is in the real world, with a probable Kane copy. She's just been changed/adapted by her contact with Area X. 
",7zqsdy
dvlpyvi,"I didn't read the book either, but here's how I understood it.

So yes, the alien doesn't just cause mutations in the DNA, it can also duplicate itself into forms that it has the DNA of. So, Dr. Ventress probably went down in the hole and did **not** run out like Kane and Lena did, therefore the alien absorbed Dr. Ventress. When Lena (and presumably Kane) went down there, it got the DNA of them (Lena had a blood drop flow into the alien) and mirrored them rather than absorb them.

From here, I'm just going to call the mirrored versions ""Fake ____"".

Fake Kane most likely did not ""convince"" Real Kane to kill himself, rather the Real Kane thought he was crazy. Additionally, **he knew he was going to die** because he could feel his insides moving, like when they cut open the stomach of their fellow soldier, so he would rather suicide. It's likely that Fake Kane and Real Kane spent some time together and talked. Real Kane probably saw a chance for Lena to be happy with Fake Kane.

Now to the ending: 

From what I gathered, it was Real Lena coming back to the world, Fake Lena burned and completely died. The reason you can see her eyes changing is because Fake Kane is still there and he is trying to change her DNA, because that's what the alien was doing all along, changing DNA. When Fake Kane and Real Lena hugged at the end, Real Lena's DNA was being changed slowly.

So, from what I understand, the ending could potentially be pretty grim. The alien is still alive and can mutate every living cell it touches BUT as Real Lena stated, the alien did not seem like it wanted to destroy the world, but change it.",7zqsdy

dwf4sx5,"I agree with your points.

I also want to add a bit of evidence to the ""clones of clones of clones""

1.) When Lena first wakes up in the shimmer, in her tent, it is an allegory of birth. We get a POV of a claustrophobic tent holding one (a womb) and we see Lena emerge from the single hole of the tent (no windows). This birthing imagery is repeated when lena emerges from the hole in the lighthouse at the end.

2.) Further, in a flashback Lena is reading ""the immortal life of Henrietta Lacks"" - about a woman who developed cervical cancer. Cancer cells were taken from her cervix and have continued to multiply, aiding health research throughout the world. These cells are clones (such is the nature of mitosis).",7zqsdy
dwf403m,"Its mostly my own understanding of identity, not so much completely rooted in the movie

the ""identity as secrets"" concept was something I learned in a college course about privacy on the internet. The idea is that we have numerous identities that form with social connections - for example we curb some of our behavior around grandma, thereby creating a secret and an identity. Similarly, we share more of ourselves with other people - for instance sex with a partner is very exposing, physically and emotionally. 

Therefore, identity is rooted in separation, we separate a portion of ourselves from another person (or people) depending on the circumstance and relationship.

Kane's clone broke down any semblance of separation between himself and another - thus he believed it *was* him. Self immolation (an extreme form of self destruction), original kane believed, was the last opportunity to gain control of himself. From a thematic viewpoint, it is saying that self destructive behavior is a response to a socially constructed identity.

There was so much birth symbolism in the film its absurd (check through my comment history), and the alien's mimicking of Lena was a parallel to how, as humans, our behavior is based on what behavior we are exposed to. Perhaps self-destructive behavior is indicative of a subconscious understanding of this lack of unique identity.",7zqsdy

When Lena asks Ventress why Kane took up the mission, she explains that we're all self-destructing in some way, and it's implied that Kane's form of self-destruction was taking on a more reckless mission as a response to finding out about the cheating.

Also, the movie only hinted at this, but the Southern Reach (agency that is monitoring the border of the shimmer) believes that whatever is inside the shimmer remains inside the shimmer. They observe the slow advance of the border and assume that they must prevent it's spread. But Kane (whether the real Kane or some other entity) exits the shimmer bringing traces of the shimmer with him, and potentially spreading the effects of the shimmer beyond the border. Lena also does this. So, some of the unexpressed questions posed are ""what else has exited the shimmer?"" ""is it even possible to prevent the spread of the shimmer?"" ""is it already too late to do that?"" 

The movie really leaves all of this to the viewer without dropping enough breadcrumbs. ",7zqsdy

e00wdvl,"I think that style of ending requires some kind of, familiarity?, with the visual and what it's trying to allude to with the audience member. I don't think anyone is dumb, I just don't think your family has experience with what the visual was trying to represent. I personally latched onto a concrete and satisfying concept for what it meant and it thrilled me to no end...but I think I already thought a lot about similar things and experienced similar visuals to explain those things...so it wasn't that big of a leap whereas for others it might be too large a leap to make in a 10 minute period with little build to that tool. 

I've had the same problem with different movies and other people will just be more familiar with what the plot is trying to showcase and they get it. You can look up an analysis someone else made and it can help you connect it more clearly on a second watch. Although, that does rob you of having your own personal interpretation. ",7zqsdy
e0g1j38,"Well when many praise the movie and have understood the story through the storyteller's movie then clearly they gave enough for some and not enough for others. It's not like I was languishing in obscurity through the whole movie and still loved it. Each step and plot point made sense to me within the build up of the narrative. Sure the final scene took some digestion and I didn't fully understand what was being stated in that scene, but on contemplation I came to a conclusion that made sense. On rewatching it was pretty clear. I think many times, on a first viewing, we have anticipation of where the plot is going and if it doesn't meet that we tend to lose a lot of the plot because we were digesting points within the context of our projected narrative and not the intended narrative. So maybe upon rewatch you can understand where it is going and therefor understand why things happened the way they did. ",7zqsdy

e09k1po,"The book is a little more ambiguous, and the structure is different. It starts off in Area X, and fills in Lena's backstory as the narrative progresses. It's from her POV, as well. All of the characters have journals, which is a plot device, as they find journals of previous expeditions. 

The locations aren't as varied, and the team stays in one camp most of the time (they aren't trekking throughout the area as long). The other 2 main locations are the lighthouse, and this weird bunker, where spiral stairs wind downwards deep into the ground. 

It's extremely ominous. The ""mutations"" to the animals are more subtle, so you aren't sure if it's really happening or not. It's a lot more than ""oh man, everything is getting all scrambled up in here!"" like it is in the film. The Psychologist is more of a character, and the use of hypnosis is a fantastic plot devise that was not used in the film. Remember when they didn't remember setting up camp, and said they had been there for days? (In the book, they don't even remember crossing the border) Eventually it's explained that the Psychologist uses hypnosis to trigger certain feelings, actions and memory loss in the group. 

The ending is completely different as well. It's left open. Lena learns that her real husband could still be alive, and goes searching. I guess it's possible a copy of her could've ended up outside of Area X, but we don't know.

If you want to know more, I suggest reading the summary on wikipedia.

The major plot points like leaving out the tower, writing on the walls, the creature, the notebooks and the room in the lighthouse with the notebook pile, and the fact that the biologist decided to just go up the coast looking for her husband was ok in some ways because they were replaced with other events that were more suitable for a movie, but the minor changes to the mystery of everything left me a little disappointed.](#spoiler)",7zqsdy

Kane clone is an exact clone, but I didn't think that meant original Kane had organ failure at time of cloning--rather, the shimmer affected the clone's system and caused it to fail. Once the Shimmer was destroyed, his clone was able to heal.

On the surface, that seems to fit my original theory, but she actually dies when she goes back into the house to *save* her teammates.

It's also very possible that how each person experiences the Shimmer depends on who they are as a person. I mean, the Physicist wasn't ever attacked, she just faded into plant life, so it's not like monsters are the only obstacle. 

We also don't know how many made it to the lighthouse. Potentially a fair number, given the skeletons there.

Lastly, we don't really know how many teams have tried. IIRC it sounded like it could have just been a relatively small number - pretty small sample size for gauging how dangerous the Shimmer is.

Then the phenomenon seems to require an eclectic and scientific group to understand it where literally years of trained and strategic effort have failed. And then the phenomenon starts to demonstrate its effects in terms of biology - we're getting really good here! This is a great setting, interesting characters, and suggests a biological twist to a standard exploration of the unknown.

...and then it essentially becomes a fantasy/horror movie rather than a mystery or science fiction movie. The characters' scientific backgrounds were irrelevant. The difficulty in terms of how much governmental and social resources applied to the problem were actually quite scant. The phenomenon itself was inconsistent and deus-ex-machina-like. There never even was a plan to foil. From the setup, I expected (and personally just generally prefer) a scifi or mystery rather than a fantasy- or horror-style conclusion. The plot itself never had much meaning or point other than as a vehicle for allegory. I took the plot seriously in the beginning and felt duped when the story itself stopped taking its plot seriously about midway through. It then felt like the characters were hooked up to the rails of beautiful haunted house ride rather than making meaningful choices as characters. 

It is pretty, it is eventful, it is an engaging allegorical piece but its plot is actually quite bad. It starts and seems to initially present itself (I think deceptively) as if it were a plot-driven sci-fi like Arrival or Inception, but it ends more like The Fountain.",7zqsdy

dwk2pu6,"Not OP but the first line was really bad. There wasn't much dialogue but most of it was bad and exposition heavy. The five major characters were contrived, they were all clearly different symbolisms that were represented. The issue is that most of the characters didn't have anything more than that one contrived defining characteristic. The characters simply had no more depth.

I also thought the science was terrible and NO that doesn't mean I am complaining about the alien. I am complaining about the humans, how they acted and reacted towards this clear crisis. They acted illogically, also how the scientists conducted themselves was laughable. Also most of the science in the shimmer was just symbolism. The time loss was never explained, to my knowledge was just used as a plot device to get the characters disoriented. Most of the shit that happened that was linked to the alien also wasn't very well explained. Yes, it can be explained by ""movie science"" and as long as the movie follows that it works but the issue is that it could be made a lot better. Many of the things that happened felt over the top, like slithering intestines, and even though it isn't a plot hole it could be much better.

In summary it just feels like most of the symbolism was forced into the movie and not naturally written into it, if you catch my drift. There are some examples of symbolisms that is much better, that fit more naturally into an actual believable plot. I can explain it to you with an example, you can watch Arrival and enjoy it for its sci fi and plot, but if you want to think about it, there are lots of symbolism tightly knit into it, almost so you don't notice. This movie however is very clearly symbolism after symbolism thrown into your face. Without care to characters or science.",7zqsdy

Apparently the guy was so turned off by the “five scientists” line so much it stuck with him all the way here? When I heard it I didn’t have a reaction, in fact it mirrored the book because they made point to say this expedition was different because it was all women and they weren’t primarily military. So it came off corny, who cares? The film is so much deeper and more interesting than some weak lines of dialogue.

dw0ouwr,"> I think you and other people missing the point in the fact that they've TRIED other tactics. They even mention that in the movie.

Where did they mention this in the movie? I don't recall them mentioning anything like sending in drones, sending in an exploratory team, etc. They mention that they keep sending in teams with the mission of finding out the source off the phenomena and those teams never come back. Well of course they won't, if there's something fundamentally hostile/dangerous about the Shimmer that kills people before they can reach the source and return. 

I think what I and others think is a glaring gigantic plot hole: they don't even know the **basic ground rules** of what they are venturing into. I find it hard to believe that a government funded scientific expedition couldn't figure out what the ground rules of a new environment are before sending in human beings.

That's like saying ""oh we don't really know what's on the Moon, or Mars. We just kept sending astronauts up there and they never came back. So let's just send one more, instead this time we'll have a team of all scientists.""

It's a weak excuse to make on behalf of the writers. If you have months/years to explore something like the Shimmer, you should have figured out within a week or two what the ground rules are i.e. time distortion, genetic alteration, memory loss, etc. 

The fact that this final team of X goes in there basically knowing nothing about what the Shimmer is or what it does besides that it keeps growing, is pathetic and laughably/unbelievably bad, like some kind of trollish joke.

dvqpbe0,"> The hole in the lighthouse is without doubt intended to be a ""vaginal cavity"" with an ""uterus"" at its end.

Oh, there's plenty of doubt

first of all, when speaking of the ""goal"" or ""purpose"" of things in a film, it's best to distinguish between the goal of the purpose of the **writer** and the goal or purpose of entities within the story itself.

It's perfectly possible that the writer wanted to convey a notion of a ""uterus"" or whatever you want - in order for it to be a metaphor, but without him intending it to be an **actual** purpose of things in the film.

For example, the lighthouse itself might be a symbolic element, but it's different to claim that there's a significance to the fact that it's a ""lighthouse"" in terms of the metaphorical intentions of the writer, vs. - a significance for the alien itself .

So, for *me* - it is quite obvious that the hole is not ""intended"" to be anything by the alien, it's the hole of the impact of the original ""asteroid"" we see in the beginning of the film.

Whatever is inside it is simply the natural growth of the organism.

I don't think ""best"" has anything to do with it --- at least not in terms of the intended meaning of the story, and anyway it's tautological to describe it this way (is there any way in which you could say that the ""worst"" was selected? in other words, which situations would NOT be describable as a ""natural selection"" process)?

> Furthermore, all members of the female and male exploration team came in with a variance of properties and had therefore different odds of survival. Some survived longer than others in the constantly mutating environment.

What's your point...?

You were trying to claim the ""shimmer is a natural selection process"".

My claim was that any environment acting upon organisms that differ in some meaningful way --- would lead to a natural selection process.
The ""shimmer"" itself has nothing to do with it, and it's impossible for an environment to NOT be a natural selection process - unless it has absolutely no effect on anything in it.
So it becomes redundant and pointless to mention the shimmer as a ""natural selection process"".

dvqk810,"I think what I disagree with is the concept of ""making it through"" as though the Shimmer is a gauntlet with a goal in mind.

Yes, her physical changes have symbolic, artistic, metaphorical meaning, and you can argue it's all ""because the writer said so"" but really it's ""because the writer said that this is what happens when you go through the shimmer"".

The movie quite explicitly says that lena's motivation not being one of self destruction is what gets her through. Her entire goal is to get out of the shimmer, to survive, and to fix her relationship with Kane -> as we know she wants to do when she ends the affair. And so that's what happens.

""To be honest, I think what it really gives the audience is… well, to an extent, I would hope it gives them respect. That they don’t need to be spoon-fed. But it also creates a requirement, which is that the film is not going to do everything.

",7zqsdy
duvjcuk,"I touched on it with a comment below, but essentially ""annihilation"" is built into our DNA in the form of apoptosis; programmed cell death. Just like our cells, people are programmed to self-destruct in any number of ways for any different reason, and every step brings us closer to our death and the annihilation of who we are.

For each person of the team it was a different reason. I can't remember names, so...

One's daughter died of cancer, and who she was as a person died with her. Just like her daughter, she was killed senselessly and brutally. Just as unpredictable and senseless as her daughter's death.

Another was suicidal, and in the Shimmer she chose to die on her own terms and in her own way.

Kane knew his marriage was falling apart due to infidelity and chose to go on the mission and leave Lena behind. Lena chose to go in due to her guilt. Unlike the others though, she had a mission and to complete it she had to survive. She wanted to repair the relationship with her husband and cure his illness. That's the only reason she survived in the Shimmer, and some interesting theories are suggesting that it was somewhat intentional on the alien's part to inject it's ""presence"" (or consciousness if you can call it that) into another sentient being and release it into the world.

At the end of the movie, both are entirely new beings; cells completely mutated and changed. We know Kane isn't Kane prime, but we aren't even sure if Lena is herself anymore or not. I don't think it matters. Neither of them are the same people that went in, and now the alien somehow and in some way resides within this couple. What happens when they have children?

Its only that i personaly enjoyed Annihilation a little bit more and not only because of the visuals(both movies had great visuals) but also because of the main story , but that is of cause only my personal taste.

From a logic standpoint, both plots are maybe not that realisitic.But what is more realistic:

- Godlike aliens which can manipulate gravity and the overall reception of time travel to our planet to change the way how we as human recive time by teaching us their language because they need our help in a few 1000 years in the future.

or

- Some alien or high,high tech alien drone comes down to earch and starts to rearrange and mutate animals and plants in a certain area around it.
",7zqsdy
dvn7ptj,">it’s the sort of plot that once you know it, there is nothing left to think over

Like anything, there's more to think about if the themes resonate with you. In the case of Arrival, it's things like the value of life when you know it will end in death, whether or not Louise was actually able to change her future once she could see it (knowing what would happen doesn't necessarily mean you can change it)... assuming she had a choice, was she right to have a child knowing it would have a fatal disease, was the joy the child experienced herself (and inspired within others) ""worth it"" knowing she'd have such an early and possibly painful death... there's plenty there to mull over if you're interested in those kinds of thing. 

Also interested in why you think ""not much is shown beyond a black ink circle and a bunch of out of order flashbacks"" - none of them are flashbacks, they're all premonitions of events which haven't happened - and the scene where the aliens tell Louise what they want is subtitled, so it's clear what they're saying (i.e. it's not just blank ink circles).

I think they intentionally left it unexplained in the movie because 1) that wasn't the focus of the story and 2) I think it's supposed to be a closed story, an alien machine meant to recover planets would have required some heavy handed exposition or something.

And there shall be in the planting in the shadows a grace and a mercy from which shall blossom dark flowers, and their teeth shall devour and sustain and herald the passing of an age. That which dies shall still know life in death for all that decays is not forgotten and reanimated it shall walk the world in the bliss of not-knowing.

dwdgem1,">This seems obvious now when she explains 'Annihilation' and how it wants to break down human cells into the smallest bits (which I guess is what the blob is)

That is not how I see the blob. The blob, that is the shimmer itself, is a force of creation. There is a theme of male/female throughout the movie. The all male team, the all female team, the affair and the romance between lena and kane. Even further, the lighthouse is phallic and the hole is phannic (female version of the word phallic).   The emergence from the tent upon entering the shimmer - its a birth of sorts (POV starts from the claustrophobic inside of the tent, and Lena emerges from a hole, edit: also nobody remembers anything prior to that morning). Further, when Cass is taken by the beast, she starts the night in the watchtower, and then is taken through the hole in the fence. The meeting of man and woman, the meeting of phallic and phannic, is creation.

The shimmer has no intention, just like the force of nature. The shimmer takes in what it is given and combines it together to create something new. 

> So I guess Kane's clone was also originally one of his squad mates that broke down like Ventress and then got some of Kane's DNA?

I am not sure. Following the creation theme above, the blob was made from within the tunnel (the womb). Lena's clone teleports from within the womb to the lighthouse, so its possible kanes did so as well (you may recall the video camera sees kanes clone outside the tunnel from within)

Further, I think the movie was an explanation of human nature - when we are born we create an identity the is an amalgamation of the things we are exposed to. ",7zqsdy

They've kept it a secret by shutting down the area outside the shimmer for miles like North Korea.

It was an all female squad because all the other teams had been predominantly male or entirely male and the director was trying one last ditch effort to change things up in the chance their interaction with each other wouldn't lead to what she assumed was a violent breakdown of all the men going crazy and killing each other.

Again in the books Area-X had been in existence for closer to 30 years, not 3. And there had been as many as 60 different teams comprised of all combinations of males and females, just never an all female crew. Also in the book several people had returned from the shimmer, mysteriously appearing at their old homes or places they had vague fond memories of. They all eventually died of the same thing Kane was dying from. Videos had made their way out too, showing the team members losing their shit and gleefully murdering each other. Ominous shadows of huge leviathans had also been caught on tape. So the all female team was the directors attempt at having a team least likely to all turn on each other.

She got the alien to ""trust"" her, then tricked it.

But like you mentioned - since the alien was already a part of Portman, it will live on through her.
Perhaps that was what the alien wanted - to live on through a real human host.

If everything is interconnected in area x(highlighted by the spreading of the willy pete), then how come all the mutations, including the mutated cells in Lena's body, weren't destroyed as well? The fact that the shimmer covers part of the ocean also messes with this. The constant churn of tides would easily spread shimmer mutated organisms across all major water ways. Its just a lot of holes and that's barely scratching the surface. I thought the film was doing a great job making it all fit right up until the end.

Whatever reason Garland had for not showing it is his business, but it made sense to me from the perspective of everyone in Area X being out of ideas and sending in a group they essentially expected to die (who cares if they have guns and/or no training, no one expects them to come back alive anyway) and the military just generally not knowing its ass from its elbow.

Nearly every character dies because of their self-destructive tendencies. One character literally self-immolates and the lead antagonist literally burns down its lair. The only surviving characters are changed from their self destruction

>If it's an allegory for man's battle with cancer what's the allegory

The allegory is that cancer is an unconscious biological process that kills its host. In order to defeat cancer you need to kill the tumor, which is a part of yourself. Generally speaking, cancer survivors become *new* people after they beat their cancer. This was in the dialogue, maybe you weren't paying attention.

It's worth mentioning that the shimmer is basically a tumor. Lena kills the tumor by holding a phosphorous grenade in its hands while it takes her form. This is an allegory for fighting cancer, because that's essentially what radiation treatment is. You subject yourself to a stimulus (which is sometimes literally phosphorous radiation) and hope that only the tumor gets burned. 

I'll admit the supporting characters were not very developed, but if they were then they wouldn't be supporting characters. They would be leads.

It's possible that you just didn't like the film, and that's fine. But none of these criticisms make sense if you actually paid attention to the film. The things you are claiming are surface to the story were literally the main themes that every scene in the film seems to allude to.",7zqsdy

on the other hand her emotional connection to her husband and conscious dedication to his memory allows her to succeed in traversing its influence where all other failed. so in the end i think she is able to contain it, or i choose to believe that given the expression of her willpower in the final scenes and the total distruction of its influence as a result of her own. i think in this way the film ends by acknowledging that self destructive behaviors will resurface but we can emerge changed and perhaps even bettered by eliminating parts of ourselves ",7zqsdy

It also reads allegorically. One as an allegory for the consequences on a relationship for infidelity. Kane and Lena are both changed due to Lena's self-destructive impulses. 

Less obvious, it also reads as an allegory for fighting cancer. Oscar, having recovered from cancer, is unrecognizable due to the trauma of his experience. Lena, loved one of the afflicted, is also changed as she is forced to experience the trauma of cancer vicariously.

But it was so much more than that. He used the name of the first book in a series and ended the story there. He changed the characters backgrounds, names, even personalities. Gave people names what never had names. Changed events leading up to the biologist deciding to go into area x, the events with the “12th” expedition in area x, what happens to people in area x, why it’s happening, what it’s doing and what it is. What audience’s got was 10% of an amazingly terrifying and weird story. Even the ending wasn’t even close to what happened, it was almost the polar opposite. It’s like if they made a lord of the rings film where frodo was given the ring, found out it was powerful, Gandalf destroys the ring immediately and they never even leave the shire.

I remarked to myself that it was strange that they post processed the light in that manner, around the time we see Lena's house for the first time.

I'm thinking what we're seeing most of the time is simply the time after The Shimmer has taken over. We're seeing clone Lena and clone Kane living in a transformed world.

That also implies that we don't know which world is which, to a certain extent. After all, The Shimmer tries to mimic, and eventually gets it right.

We see primitive structures surrounding it, crystallisation etc., the longer away from The Lighthouse one gets, the better the mimicry and specialisation, the more complex structures it is able to create. It tries and fails until it gets it right, basically.

dvres83,"> And the alien, at least in my opinion, defends itself from her.

I don't think so.
In my interpretation - the alien isn't sentient. It's more like a complex virus or a fungus.

Think for example about [that fungus that likes to plant itself in the brain of an ant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuKjBIBBAL8)  - and then takes over its brain - causing it to climb as high as possible on some tree branch - then to bite it super strong so as to pin itself to it - and the fungus burtsts out of the ant's brain - killing it - and multiplying itself, and growing...

This seemingly super sophisticated strategy of dispersal - is being applied what is in the end a brainless, non-sentient organism.

I think the alien is very much like that --

and i don't think it actively ""defends"" itself against anything - in the end it seems that it mimics Lena's own self-destruction - leading it to destroy itself.

> So when Lena says it isn't aware of her she's kinda misremembering then?

when does she say that?

didn't they ask her if it was aware of her, and she said it ""reacted to her""?

i don't think she's mis-remembering anything ---

I think there are two possibilities:

* The surviving Lena is the original one - and she remembers everything well

* The surviving Lena is the clone - and she is either lying about what happened to protect herself, or - because she's genuinely unaware of herself being the clone.  I do not favor this interpretation although I like the fact that it's plausible enough to make the ending ambiguous.",7zqsdy

The whole point of the movie is that the Alien mimics her actions, that is has no free thought of its own; it is simply informed by the thoughts and action of Lena, who is self-destructive. 

She is filled with guilt, and suicide is a heavy theme in the book. As the Alien takes her likeness, it also takes her self-destructive mindset, leading to its death. This plot point is very significant (and moving, in my opinion). If it turned out that ""Oh, it's the alien and it escaped the shimmer,"" I think that would greatly detract from the importance of the film's message, and would be a cop out.

funny that you should mention the framing because this is exactly what lends to the ambiguity: the fact that we - the audience - only know of what happened because of Lena is telling her interrogators.

So, she could be lying about what happened, or simply be unaware that she's the clone.

Also - there's the part where she loses consciousness and then regains it - with a hint of time passing between the two events. Why bother do that? 

We also see that Ventress was ""becoming"" like the mimic (her face turned non-human and she was mumbling what seemed to be nonsense) - only to then return to her original form.  To me, this was done to hint at the possibility of transitioning not only from mimic->human but from human->mimic (or whatever you want to call it).

Certain questions you asked were addressed in the movie. Like why Ventriss went into the shimmer and why they didn't just take the coast.

This is art. Like a painting or a song, it gives you things to think about but doesn't tell you what to think. If you're the type that needs question answered, I recommend staying away from anything by Lynch, Lost, The Leftovers, X Files, 2001, Tarkovsky, Donnie Darko, and so much more.

The name. The job. The things. The external trappings of reality. And I think this film shows us how offensive it is when these external forms are warped. Whether flowers, animals, our bodies, our minds, our thoughts. We are terrified of change. Because we are so conditioned to believe that the body and mind are static things. So yeah, this film challenges the western ideology of self. 

Joseph Campbell says it best. Do you identify with the light, or the lightbulb? Consciousness, or the body/mind?

dvapsrw,"Super long but here you go

Im pretty sure the Shimmer represents the unconscious mind or at least the deepest accessible part of the human mind. Journeying into the shimmer is a quest for some form of self transformation or at least for personal understanding.

 Everyone who enters the shimmer does so because they’ve experienced a great deal of trauma and adversity . Cancer, death of child, suicide attempts, adultery, addiction .

It seems they enter the shimmer primarily because they have come to the realization that they need to destruct themselves. Their life is too painful in its current state and entering the shimmer is the only logical route. By entering the shimmer they unconsciously agree to destruct their personality and their perceptions of reality. To either die in the process or in the rare case to return as something new.

They all knew going in that it was a suicide mission. Nobody in a healthy frame of mind would enter the shimmer. Because people with healthy minds do not wish to self-destruct. It’s stated that it’s a suicide mission because nobody has returned (only Kane). You can take this as a literally or figuratively in that nobody returns as the same person. In the case of Kane he literally returns as a completely different person, His journey into self destruction allowed him to create a new version of himself while destroying his original. Like a Phoenix. Like a cell splitting. Like a severe alteration in personality as a result of a traumatic event.

This is commonly referred to as an ego death. It’s a complete deconstruction of the part of your consciousness that you identify with. 

When you have a severe existential crisis, self destruction is inevitable...almost necessary. For trauma survivors it’s a way to cope with the world. You burn off part of yourself in an effort to keep surviving and become someone else entirely.

The way you self destruct can be very unintentional and confusing. When entering your subconscious you can get caught up in the terror that your mind can produce. This is like a bad trip. The bear and crocodile are both manifestations of predatory fear that is inside all of us as a result of evolution and it can easily be easily activated if you fear death. The bear only appears after somebody becomes fearful. Many times people enter on a path of self destruction and they bottle up their fear or want to return to their old self. This never ends well. Fighting your own ego death is a very violent and painful experience, It feels as if your soul is ripped out oh your body. In addition people who have bad trips often get irrationally paranoid like the girl who tied up everyone. 

The way you self destruct can be very deliberate also. For example Kane, the psychologist, Lena, and plant girl all had different end results of their self destruction because they had different motivations and were very deliberate in their execution.

The psychologist did not fear death and really just wanted to confront it, get answers, and become it. That’s complete self destruction/Annihilation. 

Plant girl also wanted to die but just accepted the death of herself peacefully. She didn’t necessarily want to confront all aspects of her deconstruction and didn’t want deeper answers. She was content with what she found.

The closer you get to the lighthouse the more determined you are for deeper insight into the self. Lena through her intense self destruction realizes that Kane has essentially killed himself as a result of the affair and a new Kane has been created to deal with the trauma. 

Only through her own self destruction is she able to come to this conclusion. Only after she enters the lighthouse and experiences her own mimic does she understand the process of ego death/reconstruction/etc and she learns exactly what she put Kane through. 

As a result she gains insight into herself, empathy for Kane, understanding, etc. 

Lena however does not need to become a new person entirely. So she kills her mimic and rejects the new self in favor of the old.

But what we’ve learnt is that anyone who enters the shimmer is mutated, so even though she maintains the same self identity.. the shimmer is still inside her. 

They are both new people 

And both Kane’s and Lena’s eyes glow at end.

dv4ugor,"You think im trying to be Superior? 

Get over yourself. 
The thread isnt a circle jerk to pat yourself on the back for liking a movie thats why its a discussion.

I just didnt like the movie. Its too open ended and felt like cliffhanger,  it was unsatisfying  bc i had more questions then answers and had to google the end to make sense of it all, pretty self explanatory..douchebag.


Even Netflix originals like Bright or Spectral that got mixed reviews atleast felt like they had a self contained story and ending.

I didnt even know it was part of a novel before, but that shouldnt matter. A movie should try to be a self contained. You look up extras, lore ,etc after the fact because its facinating, not to understand it all to begin with.Thats why i felt it was lazy, director made minimal effort or no effort to explain the setting and why things happened at end the way they did.",7zqsdy
dv53hmy,">Why were natalie and husband left?

They were the only survivors, and were thus valuable sources of information for what The Shimmer was like before Lena incinerated it.

> What happened to natalie? Is she herself a clone and dosent know it? 

It's intentionally ambiguous, make your own answer. That's like being mad that The Thing doesn't spell out whether Macready or Childs is infected in the end.

> I get shimmer changed DNA 'to create' life, but why? Why did they seem to want to destroy us, by way of changing us? 

This is spelled out pretty blatantly. It wants to change life because that's just what life does. Cells split and spread to create new organisms because that's what they do. Lena pretty explicitly says it wasn't out to destroy anything.

>What do THEY look like?

We did see what ""they"" looked like, ""they"" were the weird tessaract in the basement, and everything else in the shimmer too. It was a singled celled organism attempting to rapidly evolved by mutating and copying the things around it.",7zqsdy
dv4uwoy,"None of those questions are important. I think the only reason this movie is compelling at all is because so much of it is unexplained. It's very Lovecraftian.

Ultimately this story isn't about the shimmer. The story is about  people learning to overcome their self-destructive impulses. The film ends with the lead character realizing she's not the person she thought she was, and furthermore that she doesn't need to continue being that person. 

I don't want to have to explain Joseph Campbell's hero's journey to you here, but if you understood it you would see that the ending to the story of Annihilation isn't open-ended at all. If you wanted the movie to explain the cosmic horror elements, then maybe sci-fi isn't your genre. Try a Disney movie.",7zqsdy

The second is a bit of a leap, sure, but it's not exactly a huge one. The characters talk about their minds going, and we already saw that they lost three or four days when they first entered the shimmer. Area X messes with your head. The movie handed us all the pieces of that puzzle. ",7zqsdy

Here it is taken to the extreme, where she is literally mutated and mutated, even if she wasn't literally replaced. Is she still the same person if all of her cells changed?",7zqsdy
dvh7g8r,"Yes, but the entire movie is about cancer. That's the premise I picked up early in the film, and every scene after felt like it was devoted entirely and completely to that premise. From the first lecture Lena gives at John Hopkins to the struggle against her mirror self, everything in between alludes to cancer. The shimmer strikes, like cancer, in that everything is normal - and then it's not normal. And it starts expanding, messing with everything, as cancer does to the cells inside a person's body.

Once inside the shimmer, we start seeing the mutations, and they get crazier the closer they get to the centre. It's like that magic schoolbus episode where they explore the inside of a human body, but instead of shrinking down, the body they're examining is the Earth. 

Ventress tells Lena how she's sick of watching people, good people, go into the shimmer and never come out. That wouldn't be very different from an oncologist who loses their patients, but she feels powerless because knowledge is no defense. 

We know the movie is also about self-destruction, but still about cancer, since cancer itself is essentially biological self-destruction. 

We see a dozen shots of cells uncontrollably dividing - literally what cancer is. Not to mention a not so subtle reference to Henrietta Lacks. 

We see how the lighthouse itself has a growth that looks very much like a tumor.  

We see Radek mention how Ventress wants to face it, Lena wants to fight it, but Radek wants to give in. There's no single type of death by cancer, and each of those are relevant examples (I know, sadly, from experience here). 

We see the soldier in the pool where his body has broken apart and expanded the way cancer destroys healthy cells. 

We see Lena face off with her mirrorself, a powerful visual representation for cancer, since cancer is not an infection or a virus - it’s our own bodies turned against us. 

We see how the only way she’s able to destroy it is by burning it out, which may as well stand in for chemotherapy. It’s a destructive force used to selectively burn out the danger.

The way Lena was able to destroy the shimmer was by teaching her mimic those self destructive ways.

Had the mimic more time it too may have fled for the door.  But it was still childlike in many ways, still growing and learning.  So from this act it learned self-destruction, and the fire became a part of its ""DNA,"" spreading throughout the shimmer.  Of course fire cant really be in DNA but lets assume symbolism here can take tangible form.  This also seemed to me like Lena's reckoning with her dark passenger, the id in her that also needed to learn through mistakes (the affair) and be killed.

dutpnn8,"A note on the books: Almost all of the story in the movie is only in the movie. It's more a re-imagining of the book than an adaptation. 

1) I talked with a friend who went into the movie totally blind. No books, no trailers, nothing. He said that because they had been there for a couple years examining that place and the director said they had tried drones, he felt it was adequate enough to just go with the idea of sending the group in. He felt that it wasn't really important to spend time explaining it more because in the end none of that matters, a group is going in. 


3) It's interesting because like I said up top much of the story is a creation of Garland. She doesn't exist in the book, that scene doesn't exist. There is a conflict between the book's version of Lena and another expedition member based on distrust (and being mentally affected by Area X) but I think this version is better for the movie.    

4) ""I'm also not sure what you mean about the first time Lena is shown to be unreliable in the chair scene."" I think you misread what I wrote, what I was trying to say is: this scene IMO is to point out to the audience that Lena has lied several times in the movie.
At that point the two big ones are her connection to Kane (she did not tell Anya, Shepherd or Josie about him), and when she tells Anya and Josie that they need to go to the coast instead of turning back in order to get out. 

Going back to that friend I mentioned earlier, while he didn't pick up on the unreliable narrator idea as early as the chair scene, he did feel that in the end she wasn't being completely truthful.

They make a point of saying that humans are programmed to be self-destructive. Portman's character is an example of this, as is her husband and everyone that went into the Shimmer. As it slowly started to mimic her actions, it also started to copy her mind, and with it the 'human condition' of self destruction. That's why it lets her pull the pin, and proceeds to burn down the rest of the lighthouse. It's also why it reaches out to Kane's body in an almost affectionate way - it's his wife's mind it's mirroring.

I think they were going for a ship of theseus thing but it was caught in the middle and not fleshed out. Kane was just a clone.

It reminds her of the affair and she wants to start fresh when Kane comes home. It’s clear that Lena wants to undergo the transformation of her self and become anew.

I knew the cup of water with their fingers refracted was very symbolic of how the shimmer refracts everything. But if you look SUPER closely when Lena reaches out and touches Kane’s hands, their hands aren’t just refracted from the water. Lena’s hand is mirrored in the opposite direction, making it look like she’s stroking her own hand.

I think this is important. The movie plants the idea of Lena being untrustworthy a few times: from Anya straight up calling her a liar and distrusting her story, her lying to Daniel about Kane finding out about the affair, to her lying about heading to the coast in order to get out. 

The Biologist (Lena in the movie) in the first book also serves as our narrator and we're left with similar thoughts about whether the story she's telling us is accurate.

>Not really- not if the Plot doesn't rely on you knowing or not knowing these answers.

The progression of the movie and the plot aren't the same thing. The progression would have happened with or without plot holes as we've already seen considering plot holes exist within them movie and it's been released for consumption. Even broken messes of movies and TV shows can progress without any real attention paid to sensible plot. The narrative could remain the same as well, but I'm not criticizing the narrative.

>You are not questioning whether changes occur inside, just how quickly they occur? Is that why a car is such a big deal to you? So what if they took a car? How is the Plot any different? They could still have a river they need to cross or a bear attack... or any of the events that happen. Cars break down. Helicopters crash. Why are you obsessed with transportation issues?

That's a rather big plot point that's established in the movie. The time it took the five to travel to the lighthouse on foot was more than a week. The five didn't change much in the first few days besides bouts of memory loss. The movie doesn't explain exactly how long it takes for the changes to occur, or if they changes occur faster as you near the light house. *We don't know how fast the changes would occur if the journey was taken by vehicle. We can only assume based on what happened in the movie we were given that the changes take a few days to occur, thus a trip by vehicle that would take less than a day would likely be very different.*

We do know, however, that in-universe vehicles such as cars exist. We know that any rational person would attempt first to take a vehicle to the lighthouse in the universe that is presented which is so similar to our own. Yet, no evidence or exposition about an expedition taken by vehicle is presented. This is a plot hole. The plot of the movie would have likely been dramatically changed if the journey that took more than a week on foot could have been completed in less than a day by vehicle.

You can't simply tell me that the plot would be the same if a vehicle was used instead, because based on ***in-universe evidence*** that isn't true. An important point of the movie is the changes that the five scientists undergo as they make their multi-day journey. A mode of transportation that gets them all to the center of the shimmer in less than a day would be completely different based on what we were presented in the movie. It doesn't matter what you can ***imagine*** would happen if they took a vehicle, that's doing the writer's job for them, and it isn't discounting the existence of the plot holes.

Please don't call my attempts to explain what plot holes I noticed obsession. I'm taking the time to write what I thought about something, you seemingly wanted further explanation, and so I'm providing it. I'm sure you'd think it rude if I were to accuse you of being obsessed with defending the movie from the tiniest of grievances because you took the time to make a comment.

Again, all that was needed to fix the plot holes was some exposition. That's it. Without it, the plot holes remain. The movie would have been much different if they reached the lighthouse within a day. If they crashed before they got there, that means that a vehicle *could* have entered the shimmer doesn't it? You're asking me to imagine what could have happened in order to excuse plot holes. That's not the same as using in-universe exposition or evidence to convince me why the plot hole isn't really big.

>That to me is the dimwittedness at work. Did you see the visuals of the shimmer? Did it not resemble a wall to you? Doesn't take a lot of effort for the viewer to think that the helicopters standing off at a distance cannot go in there.

Doubling-down on an insult is certainly not conducive for actual discussion. I haven't questioned your intelligence considering your inability to accurately note what is and isn't a plot hole. ""Imagining"" what could happen without actual evidence provided by the movie is doing the writer's job for them. Plot holes exist because the writers didn't think of them, no writer worth his or her salt believes their audience intelligent just because they can imagine why something wasn't explained at all.

The amount of effort it takes for me to imagine why helicopters and other vehicles have not enter the shimmer is irrelevant. Based on the exposition we've been given, vehicles should be able to enter the shimmer just fine. If *any* evidence were given as to why they were unable to, I wouldn't have listed it as a plot hole to begin with.

>Same thing for the all woman team...did you see what the all male team did? Seeing if there was a sex difference to the reactions of Area X makes perfect sense. How is this a Plot hole in any sense?

I'm unable to parse what any of what you typed hear means. Where did I mention sex differences in reference to a plot hole? You apparently didn't read what I wrote in my OP, because there's nothing referencing the sex of the teams in terms of plot. Who are you responding to?

>Your problem is that there is a difference between Plot and Narrative and you are challenging the wrong thing here- kind of like mistaking Irony for Sarcasm.

Uh... What? Where did I challenge narrative? Is your imagination so fantastical that you imagined I wrote something different? I clearly differentiated between plot and narrative when I explained how I felt about 2001: A Space Odyssey in response to you, where I even included an example of a plot hole that could be explained with in-universe evidence which was separate from the narrative of Dave defeating HAL.

And ***mistaking irony for sarcasm***?! Your accusation of me parroting ""plot hole"" was somehow sarcasm? My stating that you vehemently defending the movie by parroting tired rhetoric while simultaneously accusing me of parroting isn't irony? Is English your first language?

I'm genuinely concerned that you are in fact stating nonsense to get a rise out of me.

>I don't think your concerns change the Narrative at all or describe ""poor writing"".

...no. Ex machina is an exploration of ""what makes us human?"" Annihilation is exploration of ""why and how do humans destroy good things?"" The bare bones of the stories overlap in that they both deal with humanity, but that's not exactly something to call copy-cat over.

so its not just about infinity, but also about self-destruction again. ;) one of the main themes here.

> This is actually an ancient symbol called ‘Ouroboros,’ a Greek word for ‘tail devourer,’ that is believed to have originated in Egypt. It has developed a multitude of uses and meanings over the years - in Egypt it represented the beginning and end of time, in Gnostic religions it symbolized eternity, and in Norse mythology, it represented Jörmungandr, the “world serpent,” an enormous sea serpent who encircles the Earth, clasping his own tail in his jaws.

> The most famous example of the ouroboros was from an early text about alchemy. It dates back to the second century, and encircled a Greek phrase - “hen to pan” - meaning “one is the all.” This illustration, created by Cleopatra the Alchemist (one of the few alchemists who was purportedly able to create the legendary philosopher’s stone, which is the primary goal of alchemy) was believed to **represent the infinite cycles of nature; birth and death, time passing, and of creation and destruction. As the ultimate goal of alchemy was to find a way to defy these cycles, it is no wonder that the symbol became significant to alchemists.**

I got that part, but what happens if Lena decided not to go? This is a science expedition, and yet there was no official biologist.

e3so76e,">Just out of curiosity, did you have any theories regarding the ending or not your cup of tea?

No, no, I can work something out.

We can consider everything before she is interviewed as a dream. Literally a dream, and nothing else. We suppose that what we see on the outside 'before' is the confused point of view of a strained mind, and never happened, or at least not in that way. We suppose that what we're seeing in the 'present' is the only thing we can trust about what the film shows us.

The ending obviously gives away that both her and her husband are now alien dopplengangers, so at some point inside the shimmer the both of them were copied and then disposed of. Her recollection could be the actual memories her double has gained from her during the copy.

If you notice, everything in the 'before' has a dream quality. Like the army going ""we're sending you because something something nobody came back ever, now take the rifle and go!"", or the stupid explanations like ""the genes are reflected"". Or the bear-monster, or the people-trees, or the physicist becoming a dryad.

They all have a distinct dream-like quality. In a dream even a smart, knowledgeable person would accept outlandish explanations because while sleeping your judgement is impaired, and your reality check systems are offline.

So we can say that she (the original) lived something possibly mundane or possibly even stranger inside the shimmer, which we will never know. Then, while she was asleep (because she fell asleep or because someone made her, doesn't matter), the alien copied her mind over, in such a way that the dream became her (the alien) real memories. So everything we see and hear of before the interview is complete fabrications and/or distorted accounts of reality.

EDIT: as for what it may *mean*, what the film is supposed to *say*, I have only that brief reference that was thrown in there towards the end: they said an organism doesn't have to have a purpose like humans do, it could be that they are beings of reaction, of instinct, like a jellyfish.

Together with the theme of creativity and differentiation that we see inside the shimmer, and how the humans are destroyed and absorbed by that environment, it could be meant to represent the immense productive power of nature versus humans' will to tame it. The soldiers' attempts at grasping the shimmer, at pinning it down with organised action, at filming it with a camera (which is inherently a representation of humanity's narrow and inflexible point of view, as compared to the nature in the dream sequences) were all useless when compared to a force that defied comprehension.

Or something like that.

LATE EDIT: Seems like this theory was even more likely that I initially thought. I was watching an analysis of the movie, and apparently, the house that the group finds inside the shimmer, the one with the giant alligator? That's Lena's (the protagonist) house, the same we see in the beginning.",7zqsdy

If literally no one has ever returned, your first mission should be send people just past the line of the ""shimmer"" and tell them to turn back AS SOON AS THEY'VE ENTERED. Then you have proof they don't just fucking vaporize or collapse from bad atmosphere or something as soon as they enter. This would have been logical when all five of Portman's party woke up and had collectively forgotten ~4 days of time. Turn back, bring samples of whatever you can find along the way. Resupply. 

Also, this should have been tried at least once in the three years they studied the shimmer: USE FUCKING HAZMAT SUITS TO ENTER FOR A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME AND COLLECT SOME BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES. This was especially true after the only living person to return from the ""shimmer"" is in multiple organ failure. Hello? Infection? Come the fuck on.

dusf7r7,"Okay, so: spoilers about hypnosis in the novel inbound!

Getting into Area X is apparently disorienting for the expedition members. So to help them through it, each team undergoes hypnosis and is told not to pay attention to the strange things they see. The hypnosis is also used to cause them to forget how they get into Area X once they’ve set up camp.

The first day that the biologist (Lena in the movie, but the characters have no names in the book) remembers, they explore a tunnel structure. She’s exposed to some spores on the wall, and begins to notice that the inside of Area X is somehow *different*.

Shortly thereafter, the team starts to disagree about things. The psychologist says some special words and the biologist notices the other two members (there are only four in the book) collapse and sleep, so she immediately does the same to avoid suspicion. She suspects that the team was hypnotized not only for crossing the border, and she theorizes that the inhalation of the spores has rendered her immune to the hypnotic effect of the psychologist’s trigger phrase. She extends this to figure out that they were also hypnotized into not noticing certain oddities about the tunnel, such as the fact that the walls appear to expand and contract slightly like the rhythm of breathing.

The next morning, the anthropologist is missing and the psychologist is disheveled. I forget what exactly happens next, but the biologist and the surveyor (other party member) head back to the tunnel without the psychologist’s knowledge. They go deeper, and the biologist feels like they’re following *something* down the spiral stairs which she names the Crawler. Eventually, they come upon the body of the anthropologist. The biologist figures that the psychologist had induced the anthropologist (through hypnosis) to attempt to extract a sample from the Crawler, and the Crawler didn’t like that very much (it killed her dead).

Fast-forward a bit. The surveyor is dead. The biologist goes to the lighthouse to find the psychologist. After investigating the top of the lighthouse, she notices something in the sand near the base — a leg that she recognizes.

She goes down and, as suspected, it’s the psychologist, barely hanging onto life. The biologist attempts to get answers to various questions she has about the expedition (short version: they were lied to *a lot*), but the psychologist doesn’t give her much. At some point, the psychologist screams “ANNIHILATION! ANNIHILATION!” At the end of the conversation, the psychologist dies.

The biologist looks through the psychologist’s clothes for any clues to the various mysteries. She finds a paper with the psychologist’s hypnotic keywords and their effects, indicating that the psychologist was concerned she would forget some. The biologist discovers that “annihilation” is one of these keywords — and that it induces nearly-instant suicide.

---

What I like most about the hypnosis in the book is that it adds an element of distrust with the psychologist, who was supposed to be the team leader. It, coupled with the withheld information, indicates that she knows much more than she was willing to explain. It’s an added layer of complexity with the Southern Reach, which I like more than the movie’s whole cancer thing with her.",7zqsdy

Then he accuses her of denying they have intellectual and physical connection that she doesn't have with Kane.

I'm just saying that the film is suggesting we (westerners) are quick to fall apart when our understanding of physical reality is challenged. Only the hero who faces their shadow self, it seems, will come out the other side. 

I would 100% agree that shadow and conscious self must be integrated and made whole. Light and dark must dance. Yin and Yang.  Agree that focusing on one or the other causes imbalance!

I totally hear what you're saying. But the western mind was far from the first to penetrate the cosmos! There are indigenous people who have communed with spirits and other dimensions for hundreds (thousands?) of years. Or wait...does that offend your western sensibilities? Like a mutant bear...or flowers growing out of skin? 

We certainly seek to know the material universe, I agree with you there. We are preoccupied with physical space and exploring the moon is amazing, no doubt about it. But we still know very, very little about anything that exists beyond material reality, due to our limited belief systems that remain rigid due to an arrogant assumption about how the cosmos work.

I already explained how these relate to self destruction but I never said that cancer and failed relationships were correlated. You didn't understand what you were reading which elicited this type of response, denial. How was this my fault?

- Hitting Lena
- Crushing Lena
- Burning its own roots

The deer with extended antlers, it observed that deer have antlers and replicated that in its own unique way. Like duplication of cells, adapting to the environment as they grow.

duvla45,"I think that's an important question. To my mind, there are two pieces of evidence that indicate that it was not the Kane clone that blew himself up:

1. Blown-Up-Kane was wearing dirty and worn clothes, a uniform that matched what we saw in the earlier video of him cutting open the dude's stomach (if I am remembering correctly). Alive-Kane was wearing a different, and much cleaner, outfit.

2. Blown-Up-Kane was exhibiting a similar warped mental state to some of the women on the team, such as the Doctor and the one who tied everyone to chairs. Alive-Kane seemed almost emotionless in the video we saw him in; and when he appeared outside the Shimmer, he was strange and alien, like a poor copy (or at least that's how I perceived him).

However, as a counterpoint:

1. If both Lena and Kane at the end of the movie, outside the Shimmer, were the ""original"" Lena and Kane, we could explain the Shimmer Eyes as being tied to their both having been altered by the Shimmer.

2. If it was, in fact, the ""original"" Kane who exited the Shimmer, then that would explain why he recovered when the Shimmer was destroyed -- because the source of his illness was gone.

3. It would be a sort of symmetry for this theory to be true (that the original Kane exited the Shimmer, and that the original Lena also exited the Shimmer). In that case, Kane 'killed' his clone by passing on his suicidal intentions; and Lena killed hers in a semi-similar way, but more in line with her ""fight-rather-than-accept"" standpoint. They both escape the Shimmer, but as different people than they entered (a theme that is repeated in many articles analyzing the movie as a metaphor for cancer).",7zqsdy

dv0xe31,"Ok. Let’s talk about it in reference to the movie then. Kane goes to the shimmer, like all others, because he is on a self destructive path.

None of them get any protective gear when they go in? Why do they have to get all the way to the lighthouse for samples? If you have to send in humans, why not tie them to a rope and send them 1 foot into the shimmer, collect a sample, and come back? And then repeat every few feet as they learn more? 

The only way they had thought to learn more was to send in squads of unprotected people with no knowledge into the shimmer for weeks at a time? It's a suicide mission. No wonder no progress had been made in 3 years. 

Also, I get that the Dr. Ventras had cancer (and technically had ""nothing"" to lose) but she seemed especially hell bent on sacrificing her safety (as well as those around her). It had so much potential but just got so far fetched and bizarre. Especially at the end. When it ended, my husband and I both looked at each other and muttered ""da fuck?""",7zqsdy
dv9qvrq,"Could one argue that the new Kane is a ""higher"" version as well since the original Kane sacrificed himself and sent the mimic off to find Lena? 

He killed the part of himself that knew of her indiscretion but he symbolically allowed himself to survive by sending off the mimic (whereas others before died with their clones - their bones outside the lighthouse.)

It seems Kane sacrificed himself. He didn't commit suicide since he allowed a new version of himself to survive and go back. This is a very jungian and kinda Christian idea: self-sacrifice/crucifixion of the self/ego in service of transcendence to higher consciousness/heaven. 

Kane has been reborn. He doesn't know where he came from. He doesn't really know anything. He has died to himself. And the ordeal that catalyzed his death and rebirth is gone with his former-self.

It makes me wonder if this is how we evolve. We kill ourselves and allow the higher parts of ourselves to be reborn in a new life. 
I feel like I've already lived many lives with different identities and I'm 38 years old.

I think physical life and death are almost irrelevant. We place so much gravity on life and death, as a culture, but give no attention to self- understanding and annihilation of self-identity. In fact we are conditioned to worship the identity and to promote the identity. Name, status, job, things. 

And like you suggest so eloquently, these superficial aspects of our humanity are no match for the primordial forces of the shadow that will destroy us if not met with awareness and focus and a desire to integrate and be made whole, which requires ego-death, annihilation.

This definitely sounds good. Alien/new/fake Kane is asked whether he is the real Kane. He implies he isn't. Then alien Kane asks real Lena whether she is still the real Lena, and she hesitates/doesn't say anything because she's changed so much that she doesn't feel like the old Lena anymore.

[I think, more than anything, it was a movie about self-destruction. They even say it in the movie. It's not a suicide mission, they're all running away from something; Anya from her addiction, Shepherd from her grief, Ventris from her illness, smart-girl from her depression/self-destruction and Lena from her apparently-failed marriage. There's a lot unspoken, a lot of inner struggle, 5 women who barely know each other all dealing with their various demons in their own ways. The Shimmer itself is self-reflection...

I really appreciate your response. I definitely believe that this warrants a re-watch, and I look forward to doing just that. I did enjoy the movie quite a bit, but left feeling more unsatisfied with the conclusion than I expected (with all of this being said, the lighthouse scene was insanely cool, almost to a transcendental effect).  I'm especially looking forward to finding details and nuances that I know I missed, which hopefully changes my ultimate understanding.

On a different note, I think this movie has the perfect makings of cult film status later in time. It will probably reach a limited audience in theaters, will most likely not perform super well in the BO, and the Netflix release coinciding with the theatrical release is a bit unusual. I think the narrative will drum up tons of conversation like the ones we're having now, especially when it can warrant repeat viewings.",7zqsdy

dw0iplv,"> Kane clone is an exact clone, but I didn't think that meant original Kane had organ failure at time of cloning--rather, the shimmer affected the clone's system and caused it to fail. Once the Shimmer was destroyed, his clone was able to heal.

That would make sense, if not for two things

A) Kane's clone teleported from the Shimmer, to Lena's house. He mentions that he was ""thinking about it"" and then he appeared there. We have to take this as fact because Lena's clone teleported from the altar room to the lighthouse, thus showing it is possible. And Kane clone has no reason to lie. If that's the case, then it shows that the clones have a deep connection to the Shimmer and gain preternatural powers as a result i.e. teleportation. Why would the Shimmer be killing them? If anything, the Shimmer is what would be keeping them **alive.**

B) If we assume the opposite, that the Shimmer was actually negatively affecting Kane clone's health, then him being outside of the Shimmer should have improved his health, not cause his organs to fail **catastrophically.**  

In essence the health of Kane's clone is sort of a macguffin. It's used as a plot device to push Lena into the shimmer, and at the end the clone magically regains his health with no real explanation... just because the ending called for it. It's one of the biggest glaring plot holes of the whole movie. ",7zqsdy

If that's the case, why does the one woman get gobbled up by the bear. Why does the girl who suffered from depression/lack of control disappear among the countless others who have visited Area-X. She had overcome her fear it seemed, and then just started turning into a tree when she found out her outcome might not be positive. 

It seems the leaders path led her to the core because the plot needed her to, and so she could give vague expository dialogue.

I assumed the physicist faded into a plant because she had already given up, since she's known to have depression and that didn't happen to anyone else.

If several military teams made it to the lighthouse, it seems like they should have been able to kill that silvery alien. Bullets didn't do much, but (somehow) a single phosphorous grenade destroyed everything around it and blew apart its influence. An expert soldier would presumably try grenades after bullets proved ineffective.

Each event in the plot marks a new depth in the descent into madness, culminating in a completely surreal and hallucinatory experience at the lighthouse.

I think that's actually a very valid criticism but I wonder if it's deliberate, like the Southern Reach in this is very different to what I expected that kind of organisation to be because they seem so rag tag and disorganised, it might be a subtle allegory for humankind's ineffectiveness in tackling natural disasters and dangerous phenomena a la global warming but that might be stretching it a bit.

It reaches out its flaming hand and touches the roots on the lighthouse, setting everything aflame. Someone in another thread mentioned that how Shepherd became one with the bear that killed her, Lena became part of the duplicate, and that it was essentially her burning the whole thing down. Which makes sense because their DNA refracted into their surroundings. Lena's house is the same house as the one the beast with the voice attacks in, so it's likely the duplicate was definitely not just an alien, but also part of her (plus it formed from her blood).

My new interpretation of the ""having a reason to get out"" is different, but I still don't think it's quite that sinister. Her husband went into a ""suicide mission"" because he was destroyed after he found out about the affair, and perhaps Lena felt responsible for his severe illness, and felt like she had a duty to fix her wrongs.

>The border extended about seventy miles inland from the lighthouse and approximately forty miles east and forty miles west along the coast. It ended just below the stratosphere and, underground, just above the asthenosphere. 

>It had a door or passageway through it into Area X.

Before the army moved in. The plaintive groan of metal and the vibration of engines that continued running as they disappeared … into something, somewhere. A smoldering, apocalyptic vision, the con towers of a destroyer, sent to investigate with the wrong intel, “sliding into nothing” as one observer put it… Some [of the sailors], though, just stood there, watching as their ship disintegrated, and then they crossed over or died or went somewhere else…

This would have been a very different movie if the central point of the movie was to communicate the experience of psychedelic drugs. 

Like I said - I think it's clear it's influenced by psychedelic experiences, and could very much be referencing specific parts of those experiences, but the story is very much a real start to finish story that's intended to stand alone. As are the books.

Take the movie Mother! for example. That is *not* a story that stands on its own. It makes literally no sense as a story by itself. The entire movie is simply plot devices set up to be an allegory.

This movie is about a strange ""intrusion"" from space, and earth's attempt at figuring it out/stopping it. That ""story"" stands on it's own. That's literally what the movie is about.

First of all, the real world works the way the movie does, and movies that are shitty, work the way you want them to:

In the real world, **we are all damaged goods**, but we manage to fulfill our tasks and duties in someway or another. Plenty of successful, capable people are fucked up in some way or another. Movies like PROMETHEUS, or shows like THE WALKING DEAD, where characters just do stupid shit to advance the plot, could be considered ""personalities coming undone"" as you say, but are just contrived and absurd.

And they **do** come undone. We see the leader's personality on her suicide mission to discover the truth, and the other girl chains them all up when she realizes she's infect and been lied to.

dvgnvsg,"Sorry for the essay. The director was being suspiciously cagey for sure, which only complicated matters because it adds an ulterior motive that we are only left to guess at. Was she manipulating Portman into going in for some reason known only to her that is never revealed, plus feeling regret for sending so many members to their supposed death, plus knowing she has cancer and is fine if this is her last mission? it's just so so messy.

Regardless of neglecting that the director had cancer, the motivations for the other characters still stand. They were troubled as is every human being on the planet, but nothing they did or said in or before Area-X, including the director, implied that they wanted to do anything but survive and find out what they were all there for. Aside from Josie who inexplicably gives up and turns in to a tree because she feels going forward is the only option, even though trying her luck going back is an option too. And her sacrifice to the effects of Area-X is so sudden that it's jarring. She was crying in terror at the bear, she saved Lena by blowing it to pieces with the rifle. The after traveling a bit decides to give into oblivion? That could have been set up in a way that we'd actually understand and feel for her finally finding peace.

Even the director didn't want to die. She just *was* dying. A by-product of her living. Her main motivation, I felt, was to find meaning for all the lives she sacrificed. She wanted to live as long as possible until she got an answer. When she does, she expounds the supposed nature of Area-X that she somehow became privy to and then is annihilated. 

Portlands character wanting to survive to be with her husband with whom she has a emotional bond with could have been the perfect reason Area-X allowed her to make it as far as she did. So she could be corrupted by it's DNA and return to the only other being Area-X permitted to leave. The affair and guilt motivation lifts right out.

Not to mention the basic fact that no one, no military or science personnel, would have ever been told of the previous missions into Area-X. This is a organization set up to learn about and eradicate a threat to our humanity. Not some asylum sending in smart but crazy citizens with rifles on a whim.

",7zqsdy
dvgjigj,"The director, having lost all hope after countless missions and dying of cancer, calmly divulges the information to Lena that no person or electronic device has ever returned until Kane. The director knows shes going in out of guilt and because she's dying, and knows that Lena deserves a chance to try and possibly find a cure for her husband who has reappeared with no explanation.

Nothing else in the story, or in logic, would suggest that she EVER told any other member the results of the previous missions. These are scientists and army personnel like any other, assigned to do a job and given only the details they need. They aren't convicts sent to the slaughter in some alien wasteland. This is an operation to try to defeat a growing Alien bio-dome. We just happen to catch the directors story at the point where she is saying ""Fuck it"" after sending in 60 or 70 people to their deaths and needs to find out if it was worth it. And it coincides with Lenas journey to foolishly think she can find a cure for him in there. 

Hell, our own military operates on the notion that they are going to places where the entities are hostile and they have a chance of being killed but they don't go there expecting to die. They do everything they possibly can to avoid death. The members of Area-X would know even less, if anything at all, if the agency is doing their job properly.",7zqsdy

Because there is no indication whether a day inside the barrier costs a week or month outside, I am floored trying to produce a theory on whether temporal distortion is an added ability of the Shimmer alien.  
  
Temporal distortion does not seem to be an ability such an alien would possess. This because its abilities arise from the manipulation of matter whereas temporal distortion is abstract and intangible. No atoms (or smaller particles) are involved in the bending of time unless one goes into quantum theory which is a subject way over my head.  
  
Thus, in this case I will stick with the first option you provided:  
*the time they blanked on is the extra months they were inside the Shimmer*. Here I also add that the passing of time while they were conscious inside the barrier may also stretch differently than time outside the barrier. This may be another contributing factor.",7zqsdy

It’s one thing for a film to be ambiguous but it’s something else for it not to make sense, or properly convey plot information that would allow the audience to get more immersed. Arrival is a film that makes sense but still urges the audience to ask questions after it( I didn’t even really like arrival but I can at least give it credit for this) but annihilation is simply uninterested in answering  common sense questions.

",7zqsdy
duvky98,"EDIT: Incoming essay, because I took your suggestion that I don't ""grasp"" the film to mean that you deserved a more detailed explanation. 

Yes the apoptosis idea has been put forth by others already, and this hard-wired annihilation being the focus of the movie would have been fine if that through-line had been maintained. 

Cass had lost a daughter to leukemia. She had lost her life as a mother and became someone bleaker that she never imagined. She didn't deserve to have her daughter die. She didn't intend on changing as a person. She ended up at Area-X but certainly not to embark on a suicide mission. So where in her story is this ""annihilation."" Where in that defined prism did she deserve to get shredded by a gigantic bear?

Kane was a dutiful husband and military operative who as far as we know did nothing to deserve having Lena cheat on him. He too was already embarking on the Area-X mission. Nowhere is it implied, except by Lena, that entering Area-X was known to be a suicide mission to him (Would he have been told about how the last ""10"" missions were all complete failures? It's doubtful.) Where in his story do we get any satisfying explanation as to why he gave up to his clone and self-immolated. 

The tough ex-addict, who had supposedly beaten her addiction if only temporarily, was the only one to become paranoid and become violent with the team members? Almost entirely over Lena simply omitting that Kane was her husband. Lena also had violent tendencies, a military background, and is the one who obliterates the gator. However she doesn't lose her shit until the end when the plot needed her to. Where in Anyas story was it believable that only she would turn on her crew mates, and then also receive a fatal mauling by the bear.

Josie was a very intelligent scientist but had self-esteem issues. Or at least a lack of control in her own life. What determining factor had been introduced up to that point that at random instances in the trip to the lighthouse, the crew members could simply choose whatever fate they wanted within Area-X like choosing off a menu, where she inexplicably decides to become a tree after casually evading Lena by walking behind a bush.

Ventress had cancer, and the guilt of sending wave after wave of crew members to their deaths. Hers was the only character that I could empathize with or whose motivations aligned with this self-destruction concept. Aside from the fact that she didn't chose to be dying of cancer, clearly. And her demeanor and actions in Area-X were mysteriously callous or cruel. And yet her fate was to reach the ""source"", spout off more ambiguous explanations of Area-X that were bestowed upon her somehow because *reasons*. Then she too somehow chooses to give up her physical form and become something we haven't yet seen and are never sufficiently told what it is. Unless she became some sort of blank canvas for the soon-to-be Lena clone to be created on, again for *reasons*. 

And Lena, the worst of the bunch. With no sufficient motivation, we are shown halfway through the movie that she decided to cheat on her husband despite us explicitly being *shown* that they were in fact in love. Then we are *told* that they have grown apart and *told* that her real motivation for entering Area-X was out of guilt. And she expected to go into an unknown, uncharted, ever-expanding alien world with the expectation of healing her now returned and dying husband...how exactly? Blind hope? Or does she just think she's the smartest person alive and will come back with a cure to erase her cheating. Again, no one expects this to be a suicide mission so they all intended on making it out except for Ventress. 

So fine, being the main character Lena makes it to the lighthouse, has her DNA extracted through a blood-tear (what?) and a lanky metallic tube is created. It chases her up the tunnel and prevents her from escaping. Through this exchange she deduces that it doesn't mean her harm, though true to her nature she acts rashly and with hostility and conveniently finds a second (of course) phosphorous grenade and destroys that which means to do her harm. Not only does this afford her the ability to escape, an outcome specifically reserved to the top-billed protagonist, but also results in the inexplicable destruction of not just her alien clone but the *entirety of Area-X*. She is then free to redeem herself, undeservedly, with her not-husband. Assuming the two of them ever make it out of that facility alive after clearly showing signs and *talking* about how they aren't themselves anymore. 

It's not a matter of not grasping the core concepts, its that the core concepts and the execution of them are on two completely different wave lengths. If you find flaws in my reasoning, please educate me. ",7zqsdy
duvs1wx,"That in no way coalesces into something meaningful for me.

Okay, the woman who self-harmed killed herself. The cancer connection seems extremely weak; multiple of them died in a senseless way.

The only reason Lena survived is because she had the will to live? Is that meant to imply that none of the countless men/women sent into the Shimmer wanted to come back alive? That seems like total bullshit to me. Even the paramedic didn't *want* to die - she was just incompetent.

There was nothing that brought this movie together in a way that will make me remember it or want to watch it again.

There wasn't, in my opinion.",7zqsdy

dvnc2jj,"When you say it like that they both seem so plausible haha...

-Some of arrival seems plausible minus the learning the language bit to perceive time in nonlinear fashion. There has been some research into this, like how aboriginals are able to perceive their location in comparison to major land marks more easily than those from most western civilizations. Also, if you use their language enough you would start to develop this perception. However, that's because of the nature of 3D space you can switch between various methods of perspective. Time is not like that for us. It flows in one direction for us while we are on Earth. Although, at certain coordinates time travels forward at negligibly different speeds to us. However, no matter what language you learn neuroplasticity cannot shift your neurons around in a way that will send information/AP's back in time to yourself. However, a sufficiently advanced species might be able to develop technology that could perceivably send information back thru time. Neil Degrasse Tyson attempts to experiment with sending information backward thru time.

I'm not sure about this one, but my shot in the dark is that destroying the shimmer's core lessened its influence on his biology, allowing him to survive outside of the shimmer's unique conditions. I think that's why nothing organic ever left the shimmer before -- the creatures instinctively knew they couldn't survive, but copy Kane was following real Kane's last wish to seek out Lena.

Yes, that's what I'm saying

Things can behave a certain way without being ""Aware"" of it - or without even having a brain

There is a type of fungus that takes over insect brains - causes them to climb high on trees and lock themselves into them - and then - bursts out of their brains, killing them - and uses this vantage point to spread its spores to infect more insects

this seemingly complex ""purposeful"" behavior is being carried out by an organism that isn't even sentient.

They didn't think to at least check the plant life literally right inside the border of the shimmer and come back out? It's clearly transparent. There str8 up they would have found the mutating dna. 

The entire purpose of the trip was to reach the epicentre which was the lighthouse. Instead of trudging through deep woods, the lighthouse was clearly and easily accessed by sea as it's right on the fucking shore. They could have taken a boat there.

They send in 5 unprepared chicks with a weeks worth of food yet they manually walk in, no bikes, trucks, other forms of transport. Not even horses? We were told electronic devices don't  work but mechanical ones clearly do given all the gunfire.

Speaking of electronic devices, we find a tape of what happened with kane and his party, thus blowing apart the whole electronics fry out. Not only that, when lena finds a STILL working camcorder, the battery hasn't run down. 

Kane is able to communicate with his doppleganger and seems to be on rational terms with it as he inexplicably kills himself. Yet Lena's doppleganger mirrors her every move except of course when she puts a grenade in its hand (and it conveniently forgets to copy her) and manages to escape - despite it mimicking her every move just moments before this.

Then of course there were the other retarded contrived plot ""twists"". Lena doesn't tell them Kane is her husband because "" it would complicate things"". Uh no bitch, it gives you a very legitimate reason for joining the expedition and makes it crystal clear what your motivation is. This was obviously set up for the other party member to put them in the kidnap situation later.

The absolutely  POINTLESS scene showing she was having an affair.

The other silly bitch, supposedly a scientist refuses to acknowledge that she saw swirling worms and dismisses it as a ""trick of the light"". This despite the fact it is exceedingly clear that the man is infected with some sort of parasite/mutated intestines.

There was so much about it that was utterly absurd. These are just the ones that spring to mind off the top of my head. The only saving grace is I didn't have to pay to watch it.

Listen, I was a lost fan. I love me some good clues that mean something deeper, but when it's at the expense of plausibility it can be an issue and another glaring example of his direction being blinded because he wrote the script. 

One of the hardest things to do when it comes to theater, movies, TV, is to direct something  you also wrote. This is why that rarely happens...this is the product. 

It's not BAD. It just kept this movie from really being the breakout it needed to be. 

I also think you're misinterpreting what ""play against the mood"" means in this context. I don't mean character breaking, action stopping moments to make the audience laugh (That's also playing the mood). 

Alright I didn't feel like typing this but here's an amazing example. I watched a documentary where the man being interviewed was giving a haircut to the man interviewing him. The man cutting his hair was a Jew that helped fellow Jews into the gas chambers to their deaths in exchange for his life. 

The guilt must have been extreme inside him. The guy being interviewed is talking about it like he was talking about what he was making for dinner that night (THATS playing against the mood, and in turn, makes that scene was more hard hitting. People seldom react the way it appears.)

The most striking part of the documentary is when the guy giving the haircut is asked how he can live with the guilt and he stops, pauses, and says ""Let's stop the interview."" 

An unseasoned director would've had the man crying and pleading about his guilt in that moment when a good director knows that's not how guilt manifests on the outside and will lead the actors to that same place. The scene is already fucked, we don't need the actors melodramatic tone to be there. People are seldom melodramatic. 

This could've been done with what he wrote, and probably would've happened with a better director that brought new and interesting ideas to the story. ",7zqsdy

dvtoiot,"Arrival is a spectacular film. It's a riff on the of the ideas of linguistic relativity (Sapir-Whorf hypothesis). These are the ideas that the structures of our language shape our worldviews and the limits of our cognition. 

Lots of philosophers have inquired into the constraints languages can impose in our discussions of things like like non-duality, subject-object ontology, process vs substance metaphysics. 

Language does have an extraordinary, almost magical quality to it. Although human beings aren't anatomically or physiologically all that different to chimpanzees (or our closer relatives like homo ergaster), our language and the cognitive revolution it birthed has completely transformed the trajectory of our species beyond all recognition. 

Culture shapes our bodies - feral children are significantly mentally disabled, because they haven't learned language at a critical stage in their development. Other animals are capable of communicating, but they don't possess anything like our ability to understand abstractions, symbols, or combine representations. We're capable of doing things that seem completely supernatural to our primate cousins because of the power of language. 

Arrival is in a long tradition of great science-fiction stories, pondering what it would be like to experience the next leap in human development, to learn the higher language, and all the abilities that would unleash.  ",7zqsdy

Also, good sci-fi doesn't have scientist characters say things that completely contradict the knowledge those characters should already have.

But *did* it replicate memories/personalities? We don't actually have evidence of that. We see Kane show up, looking disoriented. He doesn't react to Lena's affection. The only time he acts affectionately is *after* he realizes she's Lena. We know the original Kane told clone Kane to seek out Lena. We don't know how much time OG Kane spent with clone Kane, but it was enough for OG Kane to question himself, so it's possible he just told clone Kane all about Lena before he offed himself. If the clone Kane had OG Kane's memories, he'd know what Lena looked like. I think the clone's hugging Lena at the end even looked forced, it just did it because it was told that it was supposed to embrace or supposed to ""love"" her by OG Kane. It was told about how OG Kane loved Lena, but it didn't actually love Lena. That's not a replication of memory or personality, it's just a physical copy that obeyed instructions and heard some stories from the original.

The copy of Lena, as far as we saw in the film, just mimicked her movements. It didn't even talk (which Kane's clone did, but again, we didn't see how much time they spent together off-camera).

All the characters exhibit flaws, whether it's physical or emotional, and each has theirs revealed progressively.

Lena's infidelity provides the driving force behind Kane's self-destructive journey into the Shimmer, and completes the narrative theme of everything in the film being damaged, or imperfect - changed. 

The film would be enjoyable without the theme of her infidelity, but it would also be less challenging. I'd say personally you denied these friends a more interesting film experience. By giving us an imperfect protagonist the film strengthens its commitment to the greater sci-fi theme in my opinion; division of cells, loss, what constitutes separation and inclusion...

Just as the entity echos her movements and the flames of her grenade, it also reaches for Kane's body in it's last moments, echoing her intent to get back to him even though he's essentially gone.

While it seems heavily implied that the original Kane incinerated himself, I don't think the movie says anything to fully resolve that question.

Even the question of the ""original Lena"" is up for debate as the scene goes dark for a time while she's in the lighthouse. What's more, if you go with the idea that the scenes we are seeing are what Lena is reporting to the people at the base, then it's possible this is an unreliable narrator and it is clone Lena making up what happened to disguise that real Lena is dead.",7zqsdy

She chooses acceptance and we lose her after this conversation

Ventrass chooses to face it
Lena wants to fight it 

Kane wants to find Lena

Everyone going into Area-X for that mission is admittedly damaged, but at no point does anything they say or do, or the fear the feel while in Area-X, lead anyone to believe that they knew of the past expeditions. It stands to reason that neither would Kane. What kind of government organization tells its personnel ""The last 60 people we sent in died, or never came back. Sound good?""

Nothing in the movie (except one strained goodbye and the aburd affair subplot) suggests he went in because he was so broken up about her affair that he wanted to die. And if he did, the Southern Reach wasn't the place to do it as far as any military or civilian was concerned.

It's one thing to dislike this movie on it's own merits. There's plenty to dislike, but the film has no obligation to br similar to the book and from what littlr I've heard of the book I'm happy it's different.

I just don't get it, man. It's no big deal. No personal insult to you if you like it, and I accept that the book probably offered more.

And beyond that - like what if you just tied a rope to someone (the rope being tied back at the headquarters), and then once they were LONG gone into the shimmer, just dragged them back?

The tritium illuminationhas a usable life of 10–15 years.[5] Some versions of the ACOG have an additional daytime reticle illumination via a passive external fiber optic light pipe. Normally this allows the brightness of the reticle to match the field of view since it collects ambient light from around the sight",7zqsdy
dutwntn,"1) Hmm yeah I just don't agree. I think a short scene dealing with this would have made all the difference. My own anecdotal experience - I went with a group and everyone shared this opinion. We all loved the movie, but ""why didn't they just research it in normal ways"" came up a bunch. As well as ""this thing is eating everything that touches it, better send a bunch of random untrained people in again"".

4) No I understand what you meant, I think we're miscommunicating here.

I thought you meant that we were essentially showed ""fake"" scenes in the movie, and that the real things that happened aren't shown to us. That's what I assumed you meant by an unreliable narrator.

I got the impression by the end that she might be motivated by the shimmer and that it could be driving her to lie/manipulate, but I definitely never thought that maybe we were shown something ""wrong"". I understand that we're essentially just seeing her interrogation response, but they didn't really portray that... ""sense"", I guess. That seems like a leap in logic to make as an audience, and I don't agree that it's a very good conclusion. I also don't really see any places where she would be lying that would be interesting or of note. Like if she's lying about killing the thing, it seems ridiculous that it was one of the most intense/in depth scenes in the movie, and that the shimmer went away. I think there are subtle hints that could easily be dropped throughout if this was something we were supposed to consider.

Edit : Also, I did feel as though she wasn't being entirely honest in her interrogation, really, but not in the scenes we were shown - just in general, and not really in a ""lying"" way, more so in a ""withholding information"" way.

I agree she felt guilty about the affair. 
The pregnancy is just me fast forwarding the story and giving the Alien a reason for specifically having Lena come there. 
Lots of people had gone in. Why Lena? 
It could have to do with love and pain felt by the affair? But the pregnancy makes sense to me and the line “I saw you in the room with the bed” 

I think it knew it was bound to War of the Worlds itself(Cancer). It had to duplicate itself to survive and since there was only one it couldn’t cross breed with us. But a mutated human could give birth to something new? 

There’s  def something to the concept of love, reproduction & survival. ",7zqsdy

If we go either way with the idea that Lena would answer ""she had to make it back"" because she in fact was the alien-infected OG or altogether the alien, this could be dialogue used to describe human will to survive beyond all circumstances.

So it’s understandable that the characters in Annihilation weren’t AS layered as the ones in Ex Machina, as the story just doesn’t have enough focus or time for that.

I did however feel that the overall thematic point of the ""alien"" or whatever was that unlike life on Earth, it was quintessentially composed of the nature of being ""indefinite"" while the cells of beings on Earth have a determined and decisive nature.

In addition to your ideas: why didn't they try parachuting someone from above into the lighthouse area (we know satellites are sitting above the shimmer, so it can't go up into space--surely a plane could fly over it and drop someone)? Maybe they tried that and we didn't see it, but it did feel like they picked the silliest way to enter the Shimmer.


Also, it seems like there was no good reason not to take a Jeep or some ATVs with them, since they brought other technology that worked fine within the bubble (cameras, radio). They mentioned that drones wouldn't come back out of the Shimmer, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the drone didn't fly at all within the bubble. At least try to use an ATV for a bit...


It would have been a better movie if they'd said that the Shimmer started a few months ago, to make it more understandable why the government was still experimenting with how to investigate the phenomenon.",7zqsdy

Do the books give us any more information about how Area X/the Shimmer works or why?",7zqsdy
duq4l53,"> I don't see how complaining/nitpicking doesn't contribute to the discussion. 

Any movie, especially high-concept ones, can be nitpicked to death. What matters more is the suspension of disbelief, and whether the film was effective at what it was trying to accomplish.

> movie that decides that it feels the need to have the viewer constantly know what's going on.

I don't think Annihilation (the film) did that at all. A lot of it was left open to interpretation. The book is more ambiguous, sure, but that's just the nature of the medium.

> I used the source material as a contrast as to what I thought was sci-fi done right and sci-fi done wrong

None of that is clear since you never get into what makes for good or bad sci-fi.

As if it had collected enough genes, traits, consciousness to evolve. Both Lena and Kane were altered at the end. They were both infected by the organism and were not really the Lena and Kane that existed before entering the Shimmer.

I think it is reductionist to say that character should trump plot or vice versa, rather one should question the creator's intent and judge the execution with some consideration for that.

duquhku,"> You said it's not really a horror movie and your only rationale is because of a lack of enough jump scares.

That's not what I said (but I can see how it might've been interpreted that way). I used the word ""completely"" to imply that there were *parts* that resembled a horror movie. I was not trying to label or not label the entire movie as ""horror"". I also pointed out *how many* jump scares there were as a relatively independent observation. At no point was I trying to use that as ""rationale"" for the previous statement (especially not what you thought I was saying).

To clarify: 

Annihilation is part horror, sci-fi, fantasy, drama, etc. It's not purely/solely/completely/exclusively horror, so anyone watching it that doesn't like horror might find some reprieve in the parts that aren't.

On a relatively unrelated note and in no way commenting about what constitutes ""horror"", Annihilation has 2-3 jump scare moments.

However, I'd like to suggest and emphasize that the information we're given is flawed, incomplete, and (dare I say it?) mutated. Many things we're shown are impossible to explain with certainty. This un-knowability is a part of the film's strength IMO.

Specifically in this case, I'm not entirely sold on the refraction idea; that is, it's a working theory but there's no guarantee it's correct. Don't forget, the person who first gives that theory also suggested that the plants grew in a human-shape, but then went and turned into one herself (off camera though, so who knows!). We have no source of reliable information in this film. Even our narrator (for lack of a better word) is shown to be compromised at the end of the film.

Now, I freely admit there's of course a certain failure to this concept-- if we as the audience can't trust what we're shown/told from the film, doesn't the whole thing collapse on itself and leave us to various nihilistic speculation?

That's what I was trying to get at - I think whatever effects Area X has (antlers, doppelganger, shark-toothed alligator, bear with the scream of a person, turn into a flower person) there's no intelligent intent behind it. No malice or goodwill.

Think we're on the same page with everything else though, you're right, it's definitely replicating things like hitting Lena (because she went to attack her doppelganger), crushing her against the door (she ran to the door, it copied her exactly - I don't think the crushing was intentional). So it's learning violence or whatnot, but I think that learning process is kind of... passive? Yet at the same time I think learning her self-destructive nature was the real reason behind the destruction of Area X.

Case in point, she doesn't actually face an embodiment of her cheating in the duplicate of her.  The movie even points out that Lena didn't think it malicious or even aware of her.  Yet in the metaphor it stretches this...

Honestly, they're not very large novels so I'd say they're worth the time even if you end up being a little ""meh"" on the third.

dv3kcv8,Yeah I was hoping to see the crawler too. But I can't say I'm disappointed with what they did instead. Equally as weird in my opinion ,7zqsdy
dvo72uj,"Saul went into the forest and wherever he went, he established the tower. The crawler is heavily implied to be Saul, I believe the Biologist recognizes him in the first book. Besides that, the writing of the wall, according to the Southern Reach, matches the writing of Saul.

In Authority, Saul sees a vision of a meteor hitting the earth, possibly long ago. The meteor hits the shore, mixing with the sand somehow. As mentioned, the lighthouse light came from somewhere else, and it's heavily implied the fragment was from the chip in the glass that the S&S broke off from it. There are implications that they knew something about the glass and were investigating it, so that fragment ended up on the ground where it 'bit' Saul.

The clones, in many theories, are used by AX both as attempts to communicate and to spread AX. Remember that AX is not just a place, but implied to be an organism, alive but not in the sense that we know it. A common, recurring theme is understanding or the lack thereof, that our modes of communication might not be enough to interact with other lifeforms such as what is seen in AX and AX itself. The clones are likely an attempt by Area X to probe or communicate with earth. It's theorized by Grace in Acceptance that Lowrey is possibly not quite what he seems(still likely human, but irreversibly changed by AX purposefully for its own means). 

What do you mean where do we come from? If you're implying that AX has something to do with the origin of humanity, I didn't get that from the books at all and I haven't seen any other theories along those lines.

The writing on the walls of the Tower, in the most literal sense, actually comes from a dream of Vandermeer's. 

>[I won’t lie. It was disorienting and terrifying. I was scared as shit in the dream. But I kept walking down those steps anyway, until I could tell that around the corner lay whatever was creating the words. And I don’t know if it was out of fear or because my writer-brain knew if I saw whatever it was I’d never write a story about it. But I woke up, with the whole plot and main characters in my head. Along with about 500 words of weird words on a wall that remained the same in the final version of the novels.](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/01/from-annihilation-to-acceptance-a-writers-surreal-journey/384884/)

As for the actual meaning, my own personal theory is that it's what's left of Saul in the Crawler to try and communicate in his own fashion. I made an analysis a while back, but the gist of it is that if you break down the full text, the writing on the wall kinda describes Area X, what it is and what it's doing. For instance:

*Where lies the strangling fruit that came from the hand of the sinner I shall bring forth the seeds of the dead to share with the worms that gather in the darkness and surround the world with the power of their lives while from the dimlit halls of other places forms that never were and never could be writhe for the impatience of the few who never saw what could have been.*

I believe this first line(stanza?) is describing the beginnings of Area X. If you subscribe to the theory that Area X was formed due to a fragment of some highly complex alien organism that flew in from space as a result of some catacylsm on another planet or dimension, then 'the seeds of the dead' are indeed what the sliver that pricked Saul's finger were. Perhaps 'the worms that gather in the darkness' are what humanity are. We can't comprehend Area X and we're essentially blind, just like how we think of worms.

What AX does also seems to be described here. ""surround the world with the power of their lives"" is kind of what AX did in Authority, when the other two clones did whatever to cause AX to begin to grow where they were found.

""dimlit halls of other places forms that never were and never could be writhe for the impatience of the few who never saw what could have been"" is meant to just describe how AX stems from an alien lifeform that was wiped out or killed or just something bad happened to it from far away.

I could go on, but you get the idea.",7zqsdy

dvo1hdd,"Yeah Annihilation is based off a series of novels, which I hadn’t heard of until the movie came out, so I have no idea if its true. Either way I did read that Garland took a lot of liberties with the source material, so I wouldn’t be surprised if that was changed as well.

I guess one could also say that the Shimmer we see in the movie is possibly part of a larger organism that separated and just stumbled on Earth.

dvlzsil,"While I do think that's what happened, here's a counter-theory someone else offered to me:

The copy died in the lighthouse, having been overwhelmed by concepts of emotion and individuality. The original/real Kane then returned in his distant/confused/seemingly drugged state because he was suffering from the dementia-like effects of the shimmer refracting his mind. He had too much of the shimmer in him when he returned to Lena without the shimmer's unique ecosystem to support his new biology, but killing the core lessened the shimmer's presence in him just enough to survive in the outside world without entirely removing it (hence the silver eyes).  

In either case, I thought it was interesting that the dead Kane seemed to have picked up a very thick Southern accent during his suicide scene. No other version of Kane seemed to speak that way. This could mean any number of things. It could mean that the copy was imperfect, having picked up that accent from another donor. It could mean that the original had too many other peoples' DNA/thoughts/traits in him at that point, driving him mad, whereas the copy Kane was based off of an early, unmodified version of Kane.

In fact, I think the soldier who has his stomach slit open may have had a Southern accent, but I need to see it again to make sure. ",7zqsdy

I think movies like this depend more on long-term health and cult followings who are attracted to it as a defining aspect of their identity. 

It's no different than a Bladerunner. The first time I saw Bladerunner I understood the main arc but didn't really get the hype nor why anyone thought it was that deep, but upon rewatching it the depth of the arc and the depth of what was being said grew each time...it suddenly had value to me that other viewers didn't get nor care to retain and therefor became personal and exclusive to me. I don't really think it's fair to judge the quality of a movie on its inability to portray a complex plot that is perfectly understood to its fullest on the first watch. I think some messages and concepts are far too complex at the core to assume that any audience will  get them the first time around unless they already encountered something extremely similar before. Does that mean the work failed? I don't think so. I think Annihilation will be another sci-fi cult classic. I think the main plot structure was simple and interesting enough to warrant a re-watch and good enough to say it was a pretty good movie at the start and what clearly saying that what it was saying was substantial and warranted your time.

It's unclear to a fault. You said it yourself ""there's a lot of of"" stuff, but it's kind of smeared on.     
  
The characters were incredibly forgettable. It wasn't scary or thrilling, the one monster was cheesy. A bear on the coast next to crocodiles? The alien being led no where, and killing it was random. Nothing is explainable or makes any real sense enough to figure out some real plot or story. It ended up coming off a bit like m night shyamalan but without any serious plot twists and the end seemed obvious but lack luster, cheap.   
  
The narrowness of the plot/character development seemed on purpose, so I can accept some of it, but it still led nowhere very slowly. If the point is ""women's inner struggle"" then the scifi angle in this movie destroyed the message. It was like drawing a self portrait on a pair of old blue jeans. Or putting ice-cream on potato chips. Cool idea, but i can't make out a face and it seems like a hot mess. 

So if I ignore all that, and view this as a vehicle for these characters' various emotional struggle, I'd have to ignore a lot, not the least of which are the final scenes. Bad special effects, terrible reveals, dumb escape, debriefing. The structure of the mission was just so totally unbelievable. 
  
It lost in the details department. This anomaly was expanding and threatening but no other info was given after 3 years? The govt set-up to monitor it was a handful of people with really shitty equipment, no training and no security in really bad costume uniforms? Trained soldiers went in and died, so they're going to send in a team who don't know each other only two with any supposed combat training. One makes a comment about knowing how to use a gun, but they are all carrying M16's? So what, some of them have no rifle qualifications? It's all incredibly nonsensical. They weren't briefed on what their roles were within the team? Sloppy stuff here. The project leader didn't introduce them? Or tell them the one guy in the whole movie was the main character's husband? Then the one flips out about it for no reason later? Very thin, obvious plot device.  

The big reveal of the anomaly did not provoke my imagination. It seemed pointless. Literally a hole in the ground that led to a dead end light show of nothing. Then it suddenly was destroyed? The husband suicide bombed himself for no apparent reason? The same way the lost footage never amounted to anything. The whole movie was a series of dead ends just literally like the hole in the lighthouse. Everything is left to interpretation but there no inspiration to do so. All the symbolism is super conventional.

Well, now I know why. This is a film packed with highly potent symbolism. It works on a level that is much deeper than, say, Alien (one of my favorite films ever). It goes to places that we find disturbing and unnatural. It's challenging.

I think the same motivation goes for making it more character focused on Lena. I totally agree with what you said about her. In the book you are basically reading her journal so you root for her from that perspective, but she was really just the channel for learning about area X and the events that were unfolding. She had enough character that you could relate to her decisions and see her motivations, but not enough to take the full focus. The main thing that made her special in the book was that she got herself sprayed in the face right off the bat!

As far as it being the second group, I don't think that was the case in the movie. When they talked about it they would mention things like ""previous expeditions have been mostly military"" but didn't ever hint at how many there had been.

So, I really can't explain the teleportation thing, but here are my thoughts on this point: I don't think there is any ""why"" to the Shimmer, no motivation, any more than cancer has a motivation. It is neither intending to save or to harm. It just causes cell division and change. That means it can create life (like Kane clone) and then destroy that life (turning guts into worms and people into plant hybrids). It would have been interesting to see if any of the hybrid species created by the shimmer continued to live afterwards, because IMO they would have to for any of it to make sense. In the book the soldiers who get out get cancer, which I think makes more sense overall. But I still think this ending can make sense, if you assume that the effects of the Shimmer end after it is destroyed but the *life* it creates remains. So the cell division and mutation stops, but the beings that came about because of it continue. ",7zqsdy
dw16aww,"> B) If we assume the opposite, that the Shimmer was actually negatively affecting Kane clone's health, then him being outside of the Shimmer should have improved his health, not cause his organs to fail catastrophically.

Not necessarily. Try to follow my thinking here: The Shimmer altered Kane's genes in a way that deprived his health. One can reasonably assume that change is permanent (as is the nature of DNA under normal circumstances) unless you remain in the Shimmer and it keeps tampering with it.

It's not the **stay** in the Shimmer that's **causing** his illness. He got in, his DNA was screwed up, he got out. It's more like a virus, in that sense, or radiation poisoning. The change stuck to him.

Wow, it's surprisingly hard to put this into words. But can you see what I'm trying to say?

The Shimmer seems to act a lot like radiation. If you're suddenly in a radioactive area, you don't need to stay within in to retain the poisoning, you know? It already affected you. The area has nothing to do with it anymore. It shouldn't even be traceable, I don't think. It's less of an ""environment"", that way.

That's fair. I probably overstated things, but at the very least it seems like the psychiatrist preferred candidates who didn't have much holding them back to the outside world, so you might expect fewer ""strong-willed"" candidates to enter the Shimmer. Maybe few enough that luck explains the lack of soldiers escaping.

>I assumed the physicist faded into a plant because she had already given up, since she's known to have depression and that didn't happen to anyone else

That's my assumption to (especially with how quickly she changed after making up her mind), but the point is it's not just monsters. Any psychological trauma (PTSD maybe?) that a soldier has is going to be at risk of triggering their self-destruction.

>Bullets didn't do much, but (somehow) a single phosphorous grenade destroyed everything around it and blew apart its influence

It's really unclear why the alien died, or even if it did. I don't think we can say that a phosphorus grenade on its own is enough - it could easily be the grenade mixed with Lena's mentality (since we see the mimic reach out toward the corpse of Kane, it at least got some of Lena's personality/memories) that caused the mimic to ""refract"" the effect of the grenade throughout everything else around it (crystal trees, etc.). I interpret it as the mimic absorbing/taking Lena's self-destructive tendencies (and who knows what else), which combined with the grenade triggered the end of the Shimmer.

That's all guesswork though. But I do think there are some plausible explanations that make since.

>We can't say how many there were for certain, but even if there were only five (a conservative guess) that's still enough to make my point

I don't think five is nearly enough teams to say confidently one would make it through the mission successfully considering all the unknowns. So much is left unsaid about the behavior of the Shimmer, what monsters are in it, and how it can change people who enter it. A lot is also unsaid about what is necessary to ""succeed"".

dwjyrcl,"> The plot is the allegory: a physical manifestation of the exploration of marriage, depression, addiction, disease.

That is right.  But that is not a good plot in the traditional way of thinking about a plot.  The plot was clearly *not* about a biologist, an unknown phenomenon, an extraterrestrial force acting unknowingly on Earth's life, and the safety and security of our team of protagonists in dealing with that phenomenon, and growing as they deal with each other and the events of the story.  Quite the contrary - they all are picked off one-by-one like a forgettable horror flick with no investment in their own actions.  

> It’s established early that this is not some science expedition, but rather a deeply personal, almost religious journey for each of the characters. 

I didn't pick up on that until after they'd been attacked a few times - fairly late into their journey.  But more importantly, why can't we expect both?  One can have an allegorical story overlaid onto a reality - see Hamlet, see Casablanca, see Brave New World.  In this particular case, the plot *was* the allegory - but that allegory was not well-mapped onto a reality. The reality was nearly irrelevant as demonstrated by the fact that the entire story could have been told without including details whatsoever about science, DNA, the future, the extraterrestrial, or anything biological at all.  Unlike the other films I mentioned which went out of their way to set up the rules of a distinct but coherent world and then use that world to tell a story that was seeped in allegory, this film had no consistent or coherent rules of any kind.  And at that point, that's not really a 'reality' - just an untethered set of symbols.

> The “point” was never to solve the mystery of the shimmer, but rather to use the concept of the shimmer to better understand the internal conflicts each of the characters were going through.

And you're correct again.  But that's not what the first part of the movie led me to believe.  The way the movie was designed and the way it could have been executed, I actually really wanted to solve the mystery of the shimmer. I felt that could certainly have been an interesting and worthy plot - and made even yet more powerful if the underlying mystery contained and was interwoven with allegory and symbolism.  Alas, that was not the director's intention - but I didn't realize that until the end.  And so in the end I was disappointed.  I actually wanted to solve that mystery, but that fulfillment was denied me. And even worse, any attempt to self-design a conclusion was impossible because the characters didn't even try.",7zqsdy

Everything. If you look towards Ex Machina or Arrival, both of them have symbolism but it's a lot more subtle. In this movie most of the scenes had nothing going on but symbolism. It was symbolic imagery after symbolic imagery.

You missed what I said about the logic. I don't expect or even ask them to explain the alien. But everything around the alien was also illogical. I guess OP used the word science was bad but I mean more logical thinking and not science. In my opinion the movie really lacked any real take on a scientific level. My issues with the movie's science was that some of the story was never logical because they couldn't explain it in the movie. Like the time loss, how the paramedic acted and why Kane showed up at Lena's door after being gone for a year. A movie has no obligation to explain what the shimmer was and how it interuppts air waves but it kind of needs to explain the rest.

I'm actually  a huge fan of Cosmic horror, I've read a ton of Lovecraftian. But I just think this movie wasn't that well made. I understand why some people like it.

You can literally see the moment Lina gets it, she's rowing with Shepherd and she mentions that her arm might be infected or something to that effect.

Kane mentions that he doesn't feel like himself and he has a random accent that probably came from another member refracting onto him. 

Ventress leaves the group at the old base camp because ""I want to make sure that the person that started this mission is the same one that ends it"". Everything is being refracted. Someone made a great analogy that helped me mentally wrap my head around the alien. Think of it as an evolutionary accelerator, more variance and in faster periods.

Were there things you missed and wished had been included? I can live without the tower/crawler, but missed the hypnosis and some of the background/context around the Southern Reach.

No, I'm fairly confident that's exactly what's going on.

Even the lines of dialogue they exchange are things I've heard people say while coming down from psychedelics.

I'm totally with you on the story standing alone. They're not mutually exclusive. But what is the ending supposed to mean?

The fact that it was such a common feeling towards the film, I think maybe some people responded with associating anyone who didn't like it as not understanding it... simply because that's what they kept seeing.

Cass just spills the beans about everyone's shortcomings but the movie doesn't follow through sufficiently with making us feel like any of the blanket statements Cass made about them is true or has a purpose. 

The paramedic breaking down is the only character arc that seems genuine, even though she over acts the hell out of most set-up scenes and the dialogue is rough as hell. The rest are afflicted by their own demons but they don't show in the actions or in their fates. It was a weird choice to focus on this whole group being ""damaged"" (again, the absolute worst candidates to save the planet) but that's what he chose to do. Fine, but show us the connection to these shortcomings in how the plot moves. ",7zqsdy
dvgms3u,"Sorry for the essay. I think since the movie made such a departure from the novel and decided to base the plot around the ""self-destructive"" nature of people, there should have been a more gradual decline of all the characters relating to their specific struggles. If the movie hadn't dragged it's heels so much for the first 30 minutes we could have been introduced to the supporting characters in some meaningful way. Not just one exchange on a bench where they trade names and jobs, and the short conversations once inside.

Again, the movie crippled itself by explaining the characters to be one way then had them act contrary to the rules they set up. Cass was said to have lost her old self when her daughter died, but seemed optimistic and hopeful even when the team faced danger. She wasn't broken, she was recovering. And nothing in the movie showed the contrary, which is why her getting shredded by the bear meant nothing to us because she was so specifically developed and then done away with.

The paramedic had for all we know beaten her addiction. She wasn't the only combat vet there but was the only one to lose her shit. There wasn't any kind of cerebral paranoia gradually building among anyone in the team but her. She doubted the intestine-worm video (bizarrely), snapped and said fuck a few times, saw her skin move and then lost her shit and tied them all up after a small and inconsequential lie. Her struggle was her own, and it would have been better suited to have played off the other characters acting suspiciously or giving her a legitimate reason to completely snap. Her demise was seen less like a loss and more of a vanquished foe who the team was likely glad to be rid of, even if they had the bear to deal with. Another death of a character we didn't really get to know or care about, who became the villain and whose death changed nothing.

Honestly I think it was just the wrong approach to hinge the movie on the self-destructive nature of people, and the absolution Portmans character was seeking, and then to not give us enough reason to care about practically anyone or to accurately portray any kind of destructive behavior using this instance of people in Area-X.

In the book, we are introduced to all the characters right after they've entered Area-X and the surreal nature of the world and the paranoia starts immediately. The characters try to build a rapport but a series of events leads them to distrust each other as well as their own thoughts. It culminates in some pretty decent revelations, a few tense showdowns, an exhilarating encounter with the alien source, and a decently ambiguous ending. The movie makers shot for too much, to try and make it about some message. A bloated theme that couldn't be carried under it's own weight by the actual content of the film.

If it bothers you, that's fine. A movie that drops the real-world logic in the last half hour to be pretty much entirely a symbolic exploration of theme is not everyone's cup of tea. I'm just saying that it wasn't a failure on Garland's part because he wasn't trying to display the Shimmer as that... real. So looking for these tight physical minutiae about the Shimmer is like looking for the deep Buddhist themes of the Die Hard films. You aren't gonna be satisfied because they were intentionally not put in the movie.",7zqsdy
duw98ql,100% Agreed.,7zqsdy
duvm1o6,"I mean what you're saying, as a whole, is correct. But at the same time I think you're being a little too literal and you seem to be stuck in the idea that every self-destructive decision is conscious, with a reason to initiate it and an end-goal (to solve a problem) in mind. Like I've said, self-destruction is neither intentional, conscious, and efforts to repair the damage are most often not met with success.

For Cass, her death mirrored her daughter's death - senseless, unpredictable, tragic. There was nothing anyone could have done, and within seconds she was gone. You say ""she didn't intend"" on changing as a person, as if anyone ever INTENDS that. Of course she didn't intend that, and I'm not sure why this is a gripe for you. You say ""where in the prism did she DESERVE to get shredded by a bear"", as if self-destruction is a product of what people do and don't deserve. Again, you are missing the point here. It is a subtle distinction but it just isn't clicking for you.


As for Kane, remember the Shimmer rearranges DNA. People lose their fucking minds, and Kane was at the heart of the thing, likely for a LOT longer than Lena was. I'm not sure if you noticed, but his hairstyle was different, and he even had a completely different accent. Some of this is unexplained, but I think the point is that the longer you are in the Shimmer, the less you are you. His speech covers that to some degree. The self-destruction was solely him entering the shimmer; the annihilation happened inside it. 

And yes, Lena was different because she actually had the will to live. You make it sound like her going into the Shimmer was stupid because there's likely nothing she could do. Maybe, but how could you possibly know that in her position? You're seeing this from your comfy perspective. Her husband had been missing for a year, she was destroyed by guilt, and suddenly he returns from this place, and seemingly the only potential way to save him is to go inside. I'm not sure why this is a point of contention either. Would you not try to do everything to save the man/woman you loved, the person who loved you and who you DEEPLY wronged? Especially with the guilt you've carried around?

Maybe this is harder for you to digest because you've never felt many self-destructive tendencies. I only say that because you speak of it as if it is always something knowable, always something changable. Something easily made sense of and easily fixed. It is almost never the case.

duvsozm,"I fully agree. The execution of this movie was very poor, and was rescued only partially by some nice visuals and good individual scenes.

The characters were either not fleshed out at all, or they were fleshed out but didn't make sense. Ventress's motivations were easy to follow, but the team they put together seemed very poorly thought out. At first it seemed like they were gathering experts of various specialties who would bring unique perspectives and skills to analyzing the Shimmer. But one of them is simply an incompetent and panicky paramedic, while the others never really do anything specific to their specialties in a useful way.

Josie makes some comment about genetic refraction, but she hasn't done any actual research and it comes off as a very out of the blue hypothesis to me. She says the shimmer refracts genes like it does light, but that's total nonsense. Refraction is bending - in a literal way, not a metaphorical one. Bending genes wouldn't make us turn into trees or make deer with branch antlers. These things are fantastical, and in a science fiction movie, deliberate design is the only way to explain their existence. But there is nothing to suggest that an alien intelligence was deliberately making branch antlers or tree people.

It seemed like those characters weren't particularly special, and I didn't understand why they made it further than other teams. If anything, they were slow moving, tactically incompetent, and psychologically fragile. If they were able to make it this far, the first team or two should have handled the whole thing already.",7zqsdy

duvljqb,"Feel free to think that way.  
* The very first scene of the movie is Lena teaching her students about tumors and how they effect cells.  
* When she's taken to area X, she wakes up and asks what's wrong with her husband. She's told it's due to multiple organ failures, she theorizes it might be a tumor.  
* When Ventress and her are in the office talking about the Shimmer, Ventress talks about *it* spreading further and further, destroying the environment and everything we know.  
* Lena talks about the environment mutating, like a tumor when they're at Fort Amaya.  
* Lomax tells Lena, Ventress didn't matter. She had cancer and wasn't coming back anyways.  
* Ventress's final speech in the Hive/Lighthouse about annihilation was just an allegory for the Shimmer being a Cancer, destroying everything.  
  
If you really want to expound, Lena was a cancer to her marriage having cheated on Kane. The Shimmer itself was doing what cancer does. Absorb everything around it and make its' host more habitable for itself. The Shimmer was not evil, just surviving (which ultimately it did by having mutated Lena's DNA and having her possibly procreate with Kane Clone). Humans were the de facto white blood cells for Earth. White blood cells protecting the host body. The Shimmer, like a tumor, was destroying the white blood cells and reproducing itself and growing. Lena used fire as sort of chemotherapy to get rid of it.",7zqsdy
duw59fj,"> cancer is a form of ""self destruction""

The movie makes the exact opposite point, that non-cancerous cells are pre-programmed for self-destruction, and that cancerous cells are immortal.  Lena is reading a book called the Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, which is about this exact discovery.",7zqsdy
duw55k5,"Let me try a stab at this:

1) Lena's profession deals with the study of cancer cells.  One book she's reading in the movie is the Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, which is about a colony of cancer cells that have proven to be immortal.

2) Lena mentions how human DNA is preprogrammed for annihilation, that there is an inherent defect in the cells that cause systemic self-destruction -[ someone else explained this to me](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7zqsdy/official_discussion_annihilation_spoilers/dusjza9/), it's a degredation prevented in cancer cells by something called telomerase.  

3) Lena mentions how nearly everything organic growing in the shimmer exhibits traits of cancer cells, and how much of it is malignant to the host.

4) The psychologist tells Lena she should be more familiar with psychological self-destruction due to her knowledge of the pre-programmed self-destruction of non-cancerous cells, then hints that Lena likely destroyed her own marriage due to some form of evolutionary genetic programming.

So, from the above, we get a linkage between Lena's disintegrating marriage and her guilt/attempts to fix it, and her own experiences in the shimmer, which at first strongly suggest disintegration, and the locus of the shimmer plays along, yet we know she is doing all of this for her husband, and so in the end the shimmer still plays along, her actions 'saved' her husband and they are reunited.  How this connects to cancer and immortality could veer in various directions: a) maybe both Lena and Kane are now 'immortal' as they have both been infected and seemingly fully converted by the shimmer, and so perhaps they are a benign cancerous strain who will live forever as well, or b) maybe Lena did indeed destroy the shimmer, and whatever is left of it in their eyes is simply residual and will die off, much like chemotherapy killing off cancer cells (she used a phosphorus grenade, i.e. a chemical 'treatment' to get rid of the shimmer locus)...this would imply that they and their marriage will eventually die off too, like non-cancerous cells, or c) something else, lol.

How do you know that this alien-drone/mechanism does not possess
supercomputers and nanobots. It could have come with the information/building plans for both saved on some very advanced molecular hard drive with a astronomical high information storage density and a few nano assembler in it and then start building more and more ""nano""bots and microfactorys which would of cause be so advanced that they would not look anyway simular to the concept we have from ""nanobots"" today. 

Whe do not know if the whole area is not flooded with for our eyes invisable alien nano,femto or attometer tech.

Or it can change/manipulate space and time and build rooms which are from the inside way bigger then from the outside.

The rest are kind of his opinion. If I cut the cheating subplot out it makes the movie worse for me. Part of what I relate to about Lena's character is that she makes mistakes and feels guilt. Without out it she's just a stern woman on a suicide mission. 

I also don't think it's valid to criticize small roles because they had less development. They are supporting roles by definition. This was clearly Lena's story, we didn't need to see  an arc for the others. This is less a flaw of the film and more a matter of personal preference.

I'm happy to agree to disagree. As far as I can see this film has only 2 inconsistencies and i think they're pretty minor. 1) all female team and 2) no boat to lighthouse.

I don't think the movie is trying to communicate that the Lena at the end isn't the ""real"" or ""original"" Lena.

My take is that it's telling us that even though she's the original, she's still permanently *changed* by her experience and time in the shimmer. She didn't need to be the clone to no longer be the same Lena that entered there originally: she spent days or weeks (by her perception, months by external time) inside an area that aggressively alters entities, merging and melding minds, bodies, and even genetic structures.",7zqsdy

Given its a growing prism it makes sense the real mutations are happening further in. Although I do wish there was at least a reference to bots/drones that were attempted at first.  But also remember it took them like 4 days before they even found the first mutation.

This is just nitpicky. (Albeit funny) There is simply no movie if you just go straight to the thing. Same with any movie.

> They send in 5 unprepared chicks with a weeks worth of food yet they manually walk in, no bikes, trucks, other forms of transport. Not even horses? We were told electronic devices don't work but mechanical ones clearly do given all the gunfire.

No. We are told signals do not go beyond the shimmer barrier.  It was never said that electronics don't work. Hence all the electronics working.

> Speaking of electronic devices, we find a tape of what happened with kane and his party, thus blowing apart the whole electronics fry out. Not only that, when lena finds a STILL working camcorder, the battery hasn't run down.

Same as before.  Electronics clearly work and it was NEVER said otherwise.

> Kane is able to communicate with his doppleganger and seems to be on rational terms with it as he inexplicably kills himself. Yet Lena's doppleganger mirrors her every move except of course when she puts a grenade in its hand (and it conveniently forgets to copy her) and manages to escape - despite it mimicking her every move just moments before this.

 Lena is the only character that broke the ""tradition"" and actually wanted to leave.  That seemed pretty straight forward. . Kane clearly spent more time with his bio-alien. 


> Then of course there were the other retarded contrived plot ""twists"". Lena doesn't tell them Kane is her husband because "" it would complicate things"". Uh no bitch, it gives you a very legitimate reason for joining the expedition and makes it crystal clear what your motivation is. This was obviously set up for the other party member to put them in the kidnap situation later.

Fair enough. I can see how that is anoying.  I just want to point out that NONE of the stuff you mention are plot holes.  Maybe I'm being a bit pedantic but basically everything you're mentioning are things you didn't like (fair enough) and things you just didn't pay attention to.

> The absolutely POINTLESS scene showing she was having an affair.

The story doesn't work without the affair.  Its the catalyst for both Kane leaving (and not wanting to return) and Lenas leaving (and wanting to fix things)

Think of the shimmer as a ""mental breakdown.""  Many people may have one. Many change as they do. Unfortunately many don't make it out. (Or even want to make it out. Sometimes people just want the pain to end)  Kane made it out... but as a completely different person.  Lena made it out... having changed but still ""herself.""
 
> The other silly bitch, supposedly a scientist refuses to acknowledge that she saw swirling worms and dismisses it as a ""trick of the light"". This despite the fact it is exceedingly clear that the man is infected with some sort of parasite/mutated intestines.

Could be. Could also just be meaninglessness. I think that is what is is. Meaninglessness and that self-destruction is an aspect of our own meaningless nature. Still if that's the case, the cheating scene was heavy handed, and still not necessary (that whole conversation.)

I think...one thing I noticed was the concept of mirroring. That we look for meaning to describe our selves, we project that (refract it) and by looking for meaning and project it out, cause our own self-destruction. 

All the characters who died did so because they were looking for meaning. The only one I can think maybe didn't was Shephard but didn't she run out there to look for the bear? (find meaning?) 

You see that Kane killed himself in front of a camera (a source of mirror/reflection), yet Portman survived by knocking it down and away. When the mirror-humanoid started to copy and shift into portman's form, she rejected it every time. Somehow she realized that in order to survive she had to reject searching for meaning/answer as a projection of her own needs (mirroring).

But what and how in the fuck does the cheating fall into that?

Oh, it's much more absurd

It's easy to suspend disbelief to accept that some alien entity of unknown origin or essence has capabilities beyond our understanding, or that allows for physical or biological phenomenon that seems ""fantastical""

It is **illogical** and idiotic to accept the notion that the simple acquirement of some rules of grammar and vocabulary, without altering your brain in anyway - would grant you supernatural abilities

there's a stark difference between the two concepts

languages by themselves lack any ""supernatural"" capacity. Arrival is supposed to take place in a world much like our own, where people's brains don't have some innate supernatural capacity.

In arrival, it wasn't suggested that the aliens somehow altered the scientist's brain -- but that simply LEARNING THEIR LANGUAGE changed her in some fantastical way. There was no alien technology involved there. Their language isn't a technology, it's just ""knowledge"", like you might learn French or trivia facts.

>  Although human beings aren't anatomically or physiologically all that different to chimpanzees (or our closer relatives like homo ergaster), our language and the cognitive revolution it birthed has completely transformed the trajectory of our species beyond all recognition.

Sure, still a completely natural phenomenon.

Just as the appearance of wings, eyes, and countless other biological functions completely changed the natural landscape, but still operating within the confines of what's physically possible, and within very clear physical/chemical processes.

> Culture shapes our bodies - feral children are significantly mentally disabled, because they haven't learned language at a critical stage in their development. Other animals are capable of communicating, but they don't possess anything like our ability to understand abstractions, symbols, or combine representations. We're capable of doing things that seem completely supernatural to our primate cousins because of the power of language.

It doesn't matter what it appears like - it's still not supernatural in the end

> Arrival is in a long tradition of great science-fiction stories, pondering what it would be like to experience the next leap in human development, to learn the higher language, and all the abilities that would unleash.


at most it could lead to different understanding, conceptualization, etc. 

it would not lead your mind to jump back and forth through time.

the idea that language alone can make information travel backward in time is the absurd part

Regarding the hypothesis you mentioned:

> Popularly known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, or Whorfianism, the principle is often defined to include two versions. The strong version says that language determines thought and that linguistic categories limit and determine cognitive categories, whereas the weak version says that linguistic categories and usage only influence thought and decisions.

Of course there is no way of proving that in the field, so I am not sure what you would want it to play out like, if there is no correct explanation that would be easy to determine, why should the characters in a film have to come up with it?
I guess the story is very much based in reality, we didn't see any clues that science in the film is more advanced than science in the real world.

The person being interviewed says that it was something that an audience member could be expected to analyze the events of the film and come up with an answer themselves: spelling it out so directly would be an insult to the audience's intelligence.

Of course, this is different, as Alien does give a very clear reason for the audience to reason through.

You said:

The person who replied to you was responding to that.

As for the rest of your initial post on the movie, first off we don't know what Lena does and doesn't remember. She can't remember setting up the tents sure, but then there are other things she can't recall either when questioned at the end of the move, like the form of the thing she encountered. Lena wasn't more or less tolerable of the shimmer's effects, she even states herself she is disoriented. She was just the only one of the group that had an intense motivation to make it back, she wasn't just worrying about herself. 

When it comes to what the shimmer can and can't do, you are trying to apply rules to an entity that is totally alien to anything we've ever known so you can't say it is or isn't plausible that it can replicate certain things because we know nothing about it. Why would it be confined to replicating and changing just genetic things? That's like saying ""well, superman shouldn't be able to fly, because people can't fly,"" when superman isn't human. 

I don't think Vantress was waiting for Lena, I think Lena just happened to arrive as Vantress was about to change/be destroyed. I think the entity didn't replicate her because it was clearly trying to survive and Vantress wasn't a good example of something built to survive as she had terminal cancer.

The plan was lackluster but the government was officially at the ""throw shit at the wall"" phase. As Vantress said early on they'd tried a ton and failed to figure this thing out, so they were just changing the variables of the composition of their attempts. Admittedly, this wasn't the most fleshed out part of the movie though. It could have used a little more explanation as to why THIS team had any hope to succeed where others failed.

Let's be real, the real reason they don't send a boat to the lighthouse is because they needed a jungle action scene.  And that's cool.

But yes, I tend to over analyze things.  I can't help it.  I just have to think things through logically, even in a sci-fi flick.  For example, you keep saying that they've tried everything, nothing comes back.  Well then, since nothing comes back, it shouldn't matter which way they decide to send another party to the lighthouse.  They've already tried sending people on foot as well.

I just like discussing character motivation in movies.  And I don't need everything explained to me in a movie.  It's not that I don't understand the plot, there's just a logically more efficient way to get to the goal in this case and it's not well explained why characters in the movie are going the hardest way possible.

Well... that's a pretty fucked up way to look at our biology because we have the same code, in fact we have had it for longer, and we don't self-destruct like Kane does. We seek and face danger and take risks but we don't cross the line into suicide.

Your mind is mostly lost by the time you get to the lighthouse. Kane states are much in his goodbye. We have a pile or bones organized outside of it so nearly everyone gets to the lighthouse but still none leave it. Ventriss, the most driven to find the source and understand it, is driven to a mess inside the core. Teach what?

Yea, Kane is a walking, talking person in the end but you state that the Kane that killed himself is the alien Kane. For what purpose is the alien Kane going to kill itself?

It's sort of frustratingly irrational if Lena is an unreliable narrator, there are way too many loopholes, and it takes the power out of that whole end sequence in the lighthouse if that's not really the way things happened. The whole story falls apart. It's not some fun, mind-blowing twist like you'd find in Shutter Island. It would destroy the films own internal logic.

As one example, if clone-Lena were the narrator, she wouldn't have any knowledge of her previous affair or anything else that had happened, really... she would've had the same amnesia as clone-Kane.

I think the eye effect was merely a sign that her experience in the shimmer has fundamentally changed her... that not everything that was inside of her died when the shimmer disappeared. 

I haven't read the source material, but there are 2 more books. If there's to a be a sequel, a little confusion at the end gives them some room to play with.

Also, if you consider the extended metaphor of cancer... even when cancer is ""beaten"" there is a risk of remission, along with the fact that the experience will stay with you forever.... it fundamentally changes who you are. So the eye shimmer, to me, was more poetic than misleading.",7zqsdy

dvcmjg9,"There are hints to this, I think. After they wake up in the shimmer for the first time, and they're talking about how they've lost track of time, Ventress is at some distance. When the camera is on Ventress, she has her hood up, and her face is featureless--there are deep shadows over her eyes, nose, and mouth. So there's a bit of foreshadowing and perhaps a glimpse into who she is, that she's manifesting the traits she'll ultimately acquire long before she meets the force that can grant her that form. Then we learn she has cancer, and from her affect, I think it's safe to say she suffers from depression, of a philosophical kind--the world as she knows it is going to end--and practical kind--she's going to die from cancer,i.e. the world is going to end. Life sucks.

But most of all, she's a psychologist. The psychologist's calling is to understand. To put yourself in other people's shoes. The tension in the job is to not identify as your client, but I'm guessing Ventress, at this time, and for this ""client,"" was willing to throw that particular ethic away since she was going to die. 

I've written a bunch on Ventress, trying to interpret what happens to her through a Jungian lens. If you're interested I'll shoot you a link to those analyses.

this is a super intense, action-filled moment

her losing consciousness and regaining it after what is hinted to be quite a bit of time - is highly suggestive of ""foul play"" - and goes quite against the theme and the flow of that scene

how is ""confusing time in the shimmer"" suddenly related to the ultimate face-off with your clone?

why was it important to show that Kane is no longer sure if he himself is real or whether the clone is the real one? why not just show him killing himself and ""leaving the stage"" for his replacement?

I hate movies that put their ""theme"" above any discernable plot or story, because it completely derails its own efforts by being nonsensical.

2001 is a bad movie for completely different reasons. It's more a historic landmark than actual entertainment. If you enjoy visual effects alone, then it's the movie for you. But if you go into 2001 expecting a well-paced, entertaining, and thought provoking story, you'll be sorely disappointed.

She decided to confront her mortality instead of waiting until maybe she wasn't healthy enough so she could see what's in there for herself. It's mentioned that previous expeditions set off either by boat or with plans to follow the coast but they didn't return either so they assumed those paths were just as unsafe. Either way they soon decided to change course and head for the coast.  In the book though they have a more clear reason to take the path they did. ,7zqsdy
dvr03gm,"These are the interesting posts from other people in this discussion that I think explains all:

>The shimmer mimics and refracts what was there originally as well as what and who enters it. Every person that entered the shimmer was chosen or volunteered because really they had nothing to live for. Ventress says that people don't commit suicide, they self-destruct. So she sends purely self-destructive people into the shimmer which is I assume why the shimmer was growing. The shimmer didn't have a want or desire, it changed based on what went into it. The people going into the shimmer were destructive so the shimmer was destructive. Lena was the first to break that cycle because she had something to go back for. Her mirrored shimmer self didn't have a want, which is why she could destroy it without it fighting back. Kane didn't have a want to go back so he self-destructed and sent the new innocent shimmer version of himself back to Lena, the shimmer version doesn't know their past. While the real Lena does and will have to live with her decisions. The shimmer will continue to mimic and change and create based on what it encounters. The way I see it is that there is potential for it to create new good in the world if thats what its shown, but throughout the movie it is only shown bad. I see the ending as hopeful, that there is a chance of positive change, or just a lot more bad.

And the 2nd one:

>I went into my second viewing having absorbed the consensus theory online about how this was all about the characters' various forms of ""self-destruction"", but I came away this time with a pretty strong sense of what it was really about on a higher level. I think the self-destruction angle is definitely a theme, but it can't be everything because a) it's too on-the-nose since that concept was explicitly discussed in at least two different conversations between characters and this is definitely a movie that wants to be smarter than that, and b) it's a really sad and bleak message, and I actually think this is ultimately a hopeful, if somewhat solemn, movie. I'm curious to see what people think about my interpretation.
What I think this movie is about is: Personal change. It's like Lena says at the end-- the Shimmer wasn't destroying, it was changing, making ""something new"". I started thinking about this concept during my second viewing when I realized just how strongly the film seems to revolve around her relationship with Kane. It starts out with ""him"" returning to her, and it ends with the two of them together, with all those intervening flashbacks. Obviously this movie ultimately wants to be about them and perhaps say something about the nature of relationships.
Before Kane goes into the Shimmer, their marriage is damaged-- she's having an affair and he knows about it. We see that they have a legitimate spark, but we know that something is broken. We see him distant, struggling with what to do. So he goes off on his quest of ""self-destruction"". But I think the Shimmer actually represents something more- a place people find themselves at times in their lives, a sort of mental purgatory where some kind of facing of fears and personal change is required in order to move on. Some kind of ""self-destruction"" might be a necessary part of that process, if one needs to shed parts of themselves that hold back progress. It also requires facing your anger and deepest anxieties. And like Josie says, some people when they encounter a stage of personal transformation, will be eager to face it, some will fight it, and some might just peacefully accept.
So here's how I see the events of the movie from a totally metaphorical standpoint: Kane goes off on his journey. He's so hurt, sad, and damaged that when he faces the possibility of drastically changing who he is, he yields to this impulse and allows the doppelganger to return in his place. He comes back to Lena but he's not the same man, and his new self is unstable, and too alien for her to accept. His transformation has threatened to be their final separation. Lena feels responsibility for what has happened, and is now given a choice, and posed to her by Ventress at the base: she could retreat and ""go home"", abandoning Kane and their relationship. But she has given up her affair and resolved that she ""want[s] to be with him"", which will require her own journey of self-appraisal, facing down of fears, and transformation. So she sets out on her personal struggle as well, to face her lies, anxieties, and yearnings. When her turn comes to face the new person that threatens to take over her identity, she cannot accept it as readily, and mostly preserves her current self. But having resolved her internal struggle and committed to enough of this journey of transformation, she returns to Kane and accepts him in his current state. They embrace, having a shared experience and newfound understanding. It doesn't matter who either of them once were or is now-- they have accepted and forgiven the past and will move forward together.
People face all kinds of internal struggles and crises, and usually don't stay the way they were when we first met them. Staying committed to a relationship, or any endeavor in life, takes hard work, and asks that people take a hard look at themselves, decide which parts they can live with, and allow themselves to grow and change with each other. When times of struggle and transformation come, it's up to each individual how much to resist and struggle against change, and how much to accept it. Sometimes we don't have that much control over it. But at the end of the day, only through waging our own lonely internal battles can we understand and accept others as flawed and dynamic fellow human beings, and learn to move forward together, whether in a romantic relationship or otherwise.
I think ""annihilation"" here refers to the annihilation of the broken past, or parts of the self, that is sometimes needed to move on constructively.
Whew, I hope this makes some sense to people and I'm not just a crazy rambler.

Do you care about the individual ants in your experiment? She wanted to be free and knew which buttons to push to reach that goal. The revelation to the characters is also the revelation to the viewer in this movie, reflected in your dissappointment about the ""cold, calculating robot"", because you too, like the programmer guy Caleb, were hoping for true emotions.

An AIs experience of the world (especially if it surpasses human level intelligence) will be very foreign to our understanding of the world. I read somewhere that one scene was cut that showed the way Ava perceives the world, which might've been helpful.

Annihilation is a film that for the most part explores humanity's self-destruction. Everyone shares some tragedy or internal crisis that propels us toward our own annihilation. 

> ""You're confusing suicide with self-destruction. Almost none of us commit suicide, whereas almost all of us self-destruct. Somehow. In some part of our lives. We drink, or take drugs, or destabilize the happy job... or **happy marriage**. But these aren't decisions. They're impulses. And in fact, as a biologist, you're better placed to explain them than me. What do you mean? Isn't the self-destruction coded into us? Imprinted into each cell.""

This is the main theme of Annihilation, humans and their self-destruction. Why do we drink until we feel sick to our stomach? Why do we smoke even though we know it affects our lungs? Why do people have affairs when they are happily married? It is because of our self destructive tendencies. 

For Kane, he would always go on a mission neglecting his wife and their marriage. For Lena, she was having an affair with her colleague. These are forms of self-destruction. Kane's knowledge of the affair led to him volunteering for the mission into the Shimmer which was basically suicide. 
Her affair and how it might have affected Kane constantly eats away at Lena while in the Shimmer. She kept having flashbacks of this. It wouldn't make sense to have flashbacks to them just talking. Who cares if she was having conversations with her colleague? I didn't know that being married meant you could only talk to your spouse. **She cheated, it's unambiguous.** She feels guilty. This is similar to always having negative thoughts, another form of self-destruction.

Another recommendation along the lines of ""House of Leaves"" would be ""S"" by Doug Dorst.

I have been overall surprised by the lack of ""classic"" Sci-Fi recommendations in this discussion thread. So, if you haven't read ""Roadside Picknick"" and ""Prisoners of Power"" by the Strugatskys, do it right away. Absolutely fantastic novels. I'll stop my praise, my words don't do them justice. ;-)
Similarly, J. G. Ballard's short stories (e.g. ""The Dead Astronaut"") are a must (and I should mention ""Crystal World"", too).

The German publishing house Suhrkamp had this book series titled ""Die Phantastische Bibliothek"" (""the phantastic library""), running from the 60s to the late 90s, I believe. The series features almost 350 short volumes with novels and shorts stories from the dark sci-fi/horror genres. Unfortunately, they're only available in German.

Good point. I just assumed they couldn't fly low enough overhead to get a good drop without flying planes close enough to the shimmer that their gauges and tools would go nuts. But you're right, they really should have at least said that they had tried and failed in order to rule it out.

> Also, it seems like there was no good reason not to take a Jeep or some ATVs with them, since they brought other technology that worked fine within the bubble (cameras, radio). They mentioned that drones wouldn't come back out of the Shimmer, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the drone didn't fly at all within the bubble. At least try to use an ATV for a bit...

Completely agree. They showed that the compass was wonky, but that doesn't necessitate that an engine wouldn't run. If guns, cameras, and microscopes work, then why not a car/ATV? Again, they should at least try to use one and fail, or else talk about having tried it before and it failing.

Someone in this thread said the explanation in the book that inspired the movie is that the Shimmer has existed for like 30+ years and ISN'T expanding, so the government has defunded the investigation and therefore the workers are just sending in whomever is willing to go (and with whatever limited resources they have left) before they get shutdown.

dvgiiho,"That's true technically, but I believe that there are a few complications there. First of all, for me, there is such a thing as a ""perfect"" movie, as in a movie I personally have zero qualms with. Sure, there may be some technical slip-ups or what not, but if there's nothing in it that bothers me or nags at me, and I love it completely, to me it is a perfect movie. Now, that perfect movie, of course, won't be perfect to everyone. But I'll still call it perfect. For example, to me, Phantom Thread was perfect. Nothing in it bothers me at all, and I love every second. But not everyone does.
But, also, I believe that a 10/10 isn't necessarily indicative of perfection. I sort of see that as more of a sign of incredible quality. So, sure, there may be things that bother me personally in a 10/10 movie, but a 10/10 movie is one I respect deeply. But, of course, getting into the nitty-gritty details of this reveals some things I can't quite explain very well. It's highly personal. A movie can be 10/10, and thus earn my deep respect, but for it to be 'Great' or 'Perfect', it's gotta hit me, like have some impact on me. I've gotta really value the movie.

The third act imo is much easier to understand than in Annihilation, which is why I think Arrival received more critical and general acclaim (from the Academy and the general audience).

dw9jb0z,same here,7zqsdy
dw4u28z,"I don't really know what you're trying to say here, and you seem to be getting quite angry over it, but I'm not really sure why.

I'm sure there are lots of reasons for all the individual characters to go into the shimmer.  That doesn't necessarily mean that the film can't also have a theme of self-destruction, and use some of the characters' motivations to echo that theme.

For a start, almost all of the central characters have some sort of destructive tendency.  Ventress has her obsession, Josie her cutting (literal self-destruction - although not suicidal), Anya has her drug problems, Lena with her guilt over her marriage (I don't see how you can watch the scene where she throws Daniel out and not see that there is guilt, or at least some amount of self-loathing - she literally states that she hates herself).  The two where it isn't entirely clear are Cass, who states that she's lost a lot of ties to the rest of the world, but doesn't really exhibit obvious self-destructive tendencies; and Kane.  It's stated that Kane is aware of the cheating that's going on behind his back, and I'd argue that it's heavily implied (mainly by the conversation between Lena and Ventress) that they both believe that part of the reason that he was so willing to take on a mission that's so unlikely to succeed is because he believes his marriage is dying.

I recognise that they don't all literally self-destruct - Cass, like you say, dies because a bear eats her, and because it makes sense for someone to die at that time.  However, Anya does self-destruct mentally and ties everyone to chairs before going crazy; Josie willingly turns into a tree person; Ventress seeks out her obsession until it kills her; and both Lena and Kane literally kill themselves in some way - Kane actually killing himself, and Lena killing the alien version of herself.

This is on top of the handful of discussions of self-destruction (Cass describing everyone's personal self-destructive tendencies, and specifically pointing out that Josie's actions aren't suicidal, even if they are self-destructive; and then the later discussion that Ventress and Lena have where Lena states that everyone here is suicidal, and Ventress corrects her to say that they're self-destructive).

I mean, I don't think that's the only theme in the film, and I don't think it's the only driving motivation behind every character.  Lena does love Kane, and she wouldn't have gone in had she not loved him.  Kane is a soldier, and will do what he's told to do.  There's a reason for choosing the group of women going in - they're non-military experts who will be able to analyse the situation.  Lena kills the alternate self to survive.  Etc.  However, I don't think we should say that the theme doesn't exist just because it doesn't permeate every moment of the film.  I think these are all just cases where complex characters have more than one motivation, and where the film needed to be driven by a plot as well as the theme.

Your main objection to this sort of analysis seems to be that the cheating going on between Lena, her husband, and the colleague isn't self-destructive, but (a) I think they all very explicitly express upset about the situation, and (b) that doesn't change the other times the motif of self-destruction comes up throughout the film.",7zqsdy

Yes. Like your subconscious mind. You are unaware of your shadow self as you go about your day.

Again, if you want to begin to understand these concepts I would strongly suggest you read Joseph Campbell because it will help you deepen your understanding  of not only yourself but your relationship to these stories that are quite simple and archetypal. It's the hero going into the cave to slay the dragon (the shadow self).

They’re not physical manifestations of their own self destructive ways, but like Ventress said “most humans are self destructive”, which explains why only two survived (arguably they didnt survive though). . I think the word “evolution” is a good point though, since she was clearly not the clone in the shimmer at the end- but she also wasn’t “Lena” in that she had evolved into something new.  I think theres something to the idea that she survives because she stopped her self destructive ways though.

She was metaphorically “destructing” herself (and then she blew it up, and evolved into an entirely different being lol). ",7zqsdy

e0g7xx7,"I am not putting any definitions on art. But I will say this, all art has intent whether the artist intended to or not. Because even if you make art with no intentions, the fact that you chose to make it is still an intention. Okay, so if you want to make art, then at some level you want it to be appreciated right? Maybe some artists make art for a different reason, that is fine, we aren't putting a definition on art. But I am going to dare and say almost every movie is made with the intent to be appreciated on some level including this one; whether it's for a moral message or to make money is irrelevant. No one is putting a definition on art, but I can put a definition on appreciation and say if something is to be appreciated it must be clear, either consciously or subconsciously. So one of the most important skills an artist must master is clarity. For example, if someone intends to draw a raccoon and draws one but half of the people think it looks like a dog, then they failed as an artist.

So all I am saying is that movies should be clear(if they are to be appreciated) in their intent and this movie was not clear to many people. You understood this movie so you appreciated it. Now the reason it was not clear to many, is because the physical story relied heavily on the abstract metaphors in order to work and those ideas relied heavily on dialogue in order to work. Now most stories have two stories going on, right? The physical story(the events that are actually happening as you see them) and the message the writer has, sort of the deeper implication of the story read between the lines. When a story is done successfully(it is clear to most people) the physical story should still work and be effective regardless of the ""hidden story"". Why? Because this is much easier to understand. It is easier to understand an actual event that is happening in front of your eyes. Alien for example, if you were to just shut your brain off to the themes of the story and metaphors, its still works as a movie because the physical stuff that actually happens is engaging because it's clear why everything is happening throughout the entire movie.",7zqsdy

These instincts are born from frequently recurring elements in the human past, which give us all similar roots today.

Taking everything as literal or finding plot holes with the ""that wouldn't happen that way in the real world"" makes movies unenjoyable.

I have so many nots to pick about your interpretation, but I'll let most of them stand... Except for a few.

First, They explained why nothing really happened in three years. They'd evacuated nearby town and the location of the anomaly was remote enough that nobody would notice it being cordoned off.

Second, we don't know how much training they had. We don't know how much time passed after Portman's character meets the rest of the team. Even if it was a week, they could have all been taught how to use an m16, seeing as how it's a dead simple weapon system. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the croc scene, they were all inept at using the guns... accept for the ex-military character. 


The roles are clearly defined. One's a genius of some sort (I forget...), ones a medic, ones a biologist, ones a psychologist and I forget what Shepherd is. Doesn't matter anyway. They also explain why they're going in... They all don't have much to live for anyway, and they're curious. The fact that they're non-military is why they're going in. Ventriss doesn't explain Lena's relationship to the rest of the team because Lena asks her not to. The scene where Anya freaks out at the group is also explained during her monologue... Were you not paying attention? They had just seen Lena's husband gut someone on film. Anya was slowly losing her mind, which she admits to.


The husband suicide bombed himself because he had confronted an alien, gone maybe a little insane, had discovered before the mission that his wife was cheating on him... I mean, come on. That's an invalid criticism unless you watched the entire movie on mute.


You think the big reveal of the anomaly was that it's a hole in the ground? Come on. The reveal is that it's obviously alien. Whether that means anything in and of itself is pointless. It's not the hole, it's the whole thing. It's everything. Every bit of dialogue in regards to the anomaly. The anomaly is not ""the hole"". The hole is irrelevant. It could have been a fucking spaceship and it would still be irrelevant. The anomaly is something foreign to our world which tries to mimic our experience but in so doing annihilates everything it comes in contact with.

Lena is one of the cells that survives. She may not exactly be a clone but she is still a just a reflection of her former self. The shimmer 'bubble' was destroyed, which previously blocked any signals and reflections from escaping, but now it has free range in the form of Lena, allowing Kane to recover (as being outside of the bubble was destroying him, once again like a cancer).

Lena's motivation wasn't just to find a cure for him. Their marriage was a broken one, and as a couple of other characters hinted at, all the women in the group had the motivation of self-destruction, whether that be a concious or subconcious decision.",7zqsdy

So before that moment they had literally no idea about the nature of the phenomenon so it makes no sense for any of those teams to have had hazmat gear.

What do you mean what does the ending mean? It means that whatever ""the shimmer is"", it's still alive in them.

You're also contradicting yourself. If the story stands on its own, then no, it's not ""about psychedelic use"". My example of mother! is an example of a movie that is entirely referential and is ""about"" something that isn't visibly taking place. I mean, from the same director, Requiem for a Dream is a movie literally about drug use, both plot wise and meaning wise.

This is a movie that's about an alien of some kind invading earth, and the strange occurrences thereafter. Certain aspects of the story definitely feel referential to psychedelic use, but the entire movie is without a doubt not intended to be some kind of massive play on a trip.

Also - LSD is a hell of a drug. I totally understand the feeling of thinking things are somehow more connected to your experience, but generally once you really think about or take it apart, it's just LSD literally doing what it does - making connections that weren't originally (or intended to be) there.

Lastly I don't want you to misunderstand me. There are a LOT of things that I think reference psychedelics and tripping in this movie. It's definitely a clear influence, imo.

I feel like this defense of the movie can be applied to any poorly constructed science fiction film, as long as there is some hint at a pseudo philosophical narrative with interesting themes that never really develop into anything concrete or solid.

duvp6sk,"Again, I appreciate the concept of remorseless and unguided evolution being the reasoning for the senseless and awful things we experience, as much as it has been the driving force for why life on earth exists and why humans are intelligent enough to fail as spectacularly as we succeed. And that our failures are not always in our control, or that the reasoning behind certain outcomes has and doesn't require an explanation.

> Like I've said, self-destruction is neither intentional, conscious, and efforts to repair the damage are most often not met with success. For Cass, her death mirrored her daughter's death - senseless, unpredictable, tragic. There was nothing anyone could have done, and within seconds she was gone. You say ""she didn't intend"" on changing as a person, as if anyone ever INTENDS that. Of course she didn't intend that, and I'm not sure why this is a gripe for you. You say ""where in the prism did she DESERVE to get shredded by a bear"", as if self-destruction is a product of what people do and don't deserve. Again, you are missing the point here. It is a subtle distinction but it just isn't clicking for you.

This isn't clicking because as we go on to see the outcomes of the other characters, her senseless and brutal fate is distinctly her own. Her demise mirroring her daughters senseless diagnosis of leukemia works tangentially at least so at that moment I'm thinking fine, Area-X encompasses the chaotic nature of existence and that just as likely that something positive will occur something negative is also possible and both are out of our control. But then:

> As for Kane, remember the Shimmer rearranges DNA. People lose their fucking minds, and Kane was at the heart of the thing, likely for a LOT longer than Lena was. I'm not sure if you noticed, but his hairstyle was different, and he even had a completely different accent. Some of this is unexplained, but I think the point is that the longer you are in the Shimmer, the less you are you. His speech covers that to some degree. The self-destruction was solely him entering the shimmer; the annihilation happened inside it. 

Kane's outcome too is distinctly his own, but entirely contradictory to what we have been and will continue to be shown. He doesn't ""self-destruct"" by entering Area-X. He is military personnel going on a mission, and not a suicide mission in his mind. None of that is a result of his DNA or his sadness over Lena's cheating, except maybe going a day early. And his outcome mirrors Lena, for plot purposes more than anything. What made him have the most to live for, to resist the forces of Area-X for long enough to make it to the source, allow a clone to be created in it's totality, and then to seemingly give in to the idea that only one of them should be able to leave and find Lena. Not all of the members of Lena's team are weak-willed, so it must be assumed that neither was Kane's team. How fortunate that the protagonist gets to see a video recording of her husband (not one other shred of evidence from anyone else's expedition has been so perfectly preserved for future visitors). And again taking Kane's fate into consideration, his fate is entirely too perfectly streamlined which flies in the face of the so far stated randomness of existence/life in Area-X.

> And yes, Lena was different because she actually had the will to live. You make it sound like her going into the Shimmer was stupid because there's likely nothing she could do. Maybe, but how could you possibly know that in her position? You're seeing this from your comfy perspective. Her husband had been missing for a year, she was destroyed by guilt, and suddenly he returns from this place, and seemingly the only potential way to save him is to go inside. I'm not sure why this is a point of contention either. Would you not try to do everything to save the man/woman you loved, the person who loved you and who you DEEPLY wronged? Especially with the guilt you've carried around?

Lena isn't different because she had the will to live. That's the problem. She had the will to live, as did the ex-addict Anya, as did Cass, despite everything they went through. Nothing showed Lena to be more committed to her own survival, or that she had given up *less* so her story could be the one to be seen to the end. And again, Josie showed no signs of wanting to live or see the mission through less than Lena except she had a history with self-harm. However her fate is inexplicably to give up and become one with Area-X under her own free will and distinct comprehension of the rules. Deliberately rolling over, despite confronting/destroying the essence of Area-X not being the only two possible outcomes despite her insistence that they are. Again, a third eventuality of Area-X, independent from the other outcomes and inconsistent with the desired theme. 

And yes Lena's reasoning for going into Area-X was stupid. Even with her guilt and the return of her husband, what could she have possibly expected she could accomplish that 11 other expeditions had failed to. Not only had no one come out sick, no concept of what they were facing was available to her. As a biologist and as a human, it was either blind faith or a weird plot contrivance that she would enter a glowing, dangerous, invasive alien fortress. She couldn't have hoped for a cure, since she didn't know what he was suffering from. She couldn't have expected that she'd be the one to blow up the death star and rid not-Kane of his illness. If anything, her and Ventress were the only two that could have concluded it was a suicide mission but she went anyway and probably should have been the least likely to make it to the end.

> Maybe this is harder for you to digest because you've never felt many self-destructive tendencies. I only say that because you speak of it as if it is always something knowable, always something changable. Something easily made sense of and easily fixed. It is almost never the case.

I'm not sure why it's coming off that I don't understand loss or guilt or grief or self-destruction. I'm sorry for us both, and for many others, that death and pain and mistakes are a part of existence. Some avoidable, some not. I'm strictly criticizing this movies attempt to tell it's story and how these legitimately personal and ubiquitous themes were so poorly displayed and weaved together. The potential was there and again, I get what he was going for, but what the story he was striving to tell and what made it to the screen could not be so easily strung apart if there was more emphasis made to tell a solid story.



",7zqsdy
duvrdpw,"My gripe isn't with the themes intended to be presented. I appreciate the chaotic nature of existence. I would have loved a story about the annoyance of life itself. That you get dealt a bad hand or walk yourself into one and it's how you deal with it that matters. You stick to those basics and follow your own rules and I'm on board. 

If you say that sometimes the rules apply in Area-X/life, but other times for plot purposes nothing that you've been told to expect matters because certain things need to happen, it comes off as lazy and bad story telling.  

It's lazy that one character seems to exist only to give painful exposition about her own sadness and how they are all damaged goods, (despite the redemptive qualities they all seem to show) who is then savaged by a bear for an action beat in the plot. 

It's lazy to have tough ex-addict lesbian be the only one who ""loses her shit,"" seemingly over nothing distinct to her character or the plot except that she is the most offended/paranoid that Lena omitted Kane was her husband. Having no reason to knock out or tie up anyone but Lena, and having no reason to be the only one affected mentally by Area-X except that it leads to another action beat but another deviation from the ""Do the characters have autonomy or not"" theme.

It's lazy that Josie has some unearned and inexplicable communion with Area-X to the point that she can give up and turn herself into a tree, because to her the only options are go forward and confront the beast. She breaks the rules, displays an understanding that none of the other characters have achieved, in much less time than could be argued that it took Kane to ""figure out the rules."" It breaks immersion, it throws a wrench in the story.

It's lazy that Ventress gets to the source and again, for inexplicable reasons, is given a hint at the nature of Area-X by *something* for *reasons* and then she too seems to willingly give up her physical form and become a ball of light that Area-X needs. Or doesn't need. Clearly it factors into Lena's fate. So again, is there agency among the characters or the presence of Area-X? So far the world-building is all over the map so let's just say screw it until the end.

It's lazy that Lena remains a character we are expected to root for ( I only say that because of how much screen time she is allotted at the end) despite the fact that she seems to be the only one who legitimately set out to carelessly fulfill her own desires at the expense of someone else. It's lazy that her arrival at the lighthouse is met with a video recorder (ugh) of her husband (keep in mind how little was left of any other visitor to Area-X, this being the second VIDEO evidence featuring Kane). It's unclear how or why Kane was able to make it to the point of full replication of his mimic and in a few words decides to self-immolate and send this ""creature"" to find his wife. Does he know it's intentions? Have they had conversations? It should matter, but we don't get to know. Lazy.

It's lazy that she experiences the wonder (horror?) of this alien attempting to reproduce her, only to find another (of course) phosphorous grenade and again revert to her baser instincts to blow it up. Which inexplicably brings down *all of Area-X* except whatever version of her resides within it. Why does the fire purge the entire shimmer, but leave her be? It doesn't matter. Lazy.

Ex-Machina had Ava fulfill all the requirements of what it means to be fully, yet artificially, intelligent. She takes advantage of Caleb and her Creator perfectly, for her own self-preservation. She escapes, showing a beautiful quick shot of remorse and she abandons Caleb to die knowing he is a weakness to her continued existence. She is free to roam humanity, either for our betterment or our detriment. Beautiful.

Lena, confined to a government facility, finds her husband and implies that she knows he's not really himself anymore since neither is she. They both admit this, embrace, and their eyes glow pink. While they are in a room full of government officials and video/audio equipment. As if they wouldn't immediately be dissected and destroyed, since the cellular change is so evident that even Lena could see it on a portable micro-scope. Their escape from, and experience in, Area-X means nothing. Not thought-provoking. Lazy.

I guess the way I feel about it is: I don’t doubt the alien(s) could make clothes, but what clone-Kane is wearing isn’t a copy of what the OG-Kane is wearing. Moreover, I feel like I’m supposed to believe that this alien has “evolved”, was designed, or came to be at some point beyond “simple” human intentionally. If that’s the case, mimicking organic matter through DNA replication makes sense, but making a literal carbon copy of clothing seems way too “beneath” it, or at least it reeks of anthropomorphism.

In fact, the anthropomorphism of the alien is the aspect of the movie where it took a hit for me. They set everything up in such an unanthrpamorphic way which was great, and then that all falls apart towards the end. I’m all for some alien working on some level we can’t understand, but when it makes clothes, and then seems to show some ulterior, human-like motive in the very last scene, it just reminds me that the producers want to make money (I.e., can’t get too deep with the plot and always keep things open for sequels). <— So I’d be curious to read the book to see if these are in fact plot holes (IMO) made in film production.",7zqsdy

In Alien they set up the 'space trucker' aesthetic from the first scenes. We were told it wasn't a military craft by hundreds, if not thousands, of unspoken visual cues. By the time they're making makeshift weapons we get it. They are on a commercial space vessel with a predatory alien that they (and we the viewer) know fuck all about and they have fuck all to deal with it. There's a consistent truth that everything hinged off.

In Annihilation, we are on Earth. Scenes like the cops stopping the ambulance made me feel as though the venture had a huge amount of resources at its disposal. They could muster half a dozen SUVs to stop an ambulance but they send in small teams of soldiers and no scientists, or, scientists and no soldiers. And then it seems like the lady in charge was running out of options. Why? Isn't this an existential threat to humanity?

... Exactly: it doesn't matter. The way you phrase this sounds like you see it as a bit of a ""gotcha"" to my point, but it's not. There's three years of expeditions into the shimmer that the movie doesn't show us. There's likely expeditions that followed Lena's in the months after they didn't return.

Based on what the movie tells us, those three years of expeditions have tried everything you can think of: going by boat, by horse, by tank, by helicopter; parachuting in; tying someone to a rope and trying to pull them back out 5 minutes later, 30 seconds later, 1 second later; using a wired robot; shoving a camera through using an extra long selfie stick. The movie gives us enough evidence assume that if you can think of something ""obvious"" that they have already tried it. And that the result was always the same: *nothing came back*.

We didn't see *those* other expeditions. We saw one that happened to go by land. So yes, it doesn't matter how they decided to send this expedition. We got one that went by land, because it didn't matter so they went with one option and tried that.",7zqsdy

Honestly, regardless have how outright suicidal he might have been (if so, usually you would think you would be honorably discharged and not sent to a secret military organization as a compromised asset), the idea that this black ops organization investigating an alien aberration on earth would consistently send in damaged or poorly functioning scientists to potentially save us from the threat is absurd and an awful story choice by Garland. 

I am likely biased from reading the books, since the characters are sent in or volunteer because of their genuine curiosity of the anomaly and the terror is derived from what they experience. It's only Garlands manipulation of the source material that requires this ""everyone is damaged"" through-line as a plot device.

It makes no feasible sense that any branch of any government wouldn't send in only their best to discover what is going on. This also goes for 12, 24, 100 expeditions in.

> how is ""confusing time in the shimmer"" suddenly related to the ultimate face-off with your clone?

Perception and reality are odd in the shimmer. The first experience we have with the characters in there is them having lost track of several days and having no recollection of how they got there. Lena states in her ""debriefing"" that she has no memory of eating, and can't even seem to properly recall how long she was in there for, giving a range of ""days to weeks"" for her time spent there. The lighthouse is the heart of the shimmer, where you'd expect its effects to be strongest. Time being odd to her isn't directly a part of her confrontation with her ""clone"" but a reinforcement of the impacts and oddities of *where* she is.

> why was it important to show that Kane is no longer sure if he himself is real or whether the clone is the real one?

This goes back to dialogue earlier in the film. People and DNA are dispersed through a ""prism"" as worded by Josie People are merging together, gaining aspects of others and losing aspects of themselves. Lena gained the ouroboros tattoo of her comrade -- and that tattoo was even transferred to a member of Kane's expedition. Kane picked up the southern accent of one of his comrades.

dw3ias7,"> Was it too obscene for you? There wasn't even any nudity.

I am jaded like most people with unlimited access to porn.  That 1-second titty tease does nothing for me.  I like to keep my porn out of my mainstream movies.  When I watch porn, I do not want any dialogue or plot.  When I watch mainstream movies - particularly sci-fi and action movies - I don't want any sex scenes.  It makes a movie that I can watch with my teen nephew and niece into a movie I can't watch with my teen nephew and niece.  

> Annihilation is a film that for the most part explores humanity's self-destruction: *""You're confusing suicide with self-destruction. Almost none of us commit suicide, whereas almost all of us self-destruct. Somehow. In some part of our lives. We drink, or take drugs, or destabilize the happy job... or happy marriage. But these aren't decisions. They're impulses. And in fact, as a biologist, you're better placed to explain them than me. What do you mean? Isn't the self-destruction coded into us? Imprinted into each cell.""*

You see, that's why I can see people call this movie pretentious if in fact the author of the book or director of the movie felt this way.  IT'S FUCKING PHILOSOPHICAL BULLSHIT!  What kind of ""original sin"" is this?  We are just animals like the deer or bear.  As animals, we have basic impulses for survival - to eat and procreate.  What ""tragedy or internal crisis that propels us toward our own annihilation"" did the bear, alligator, deer, or plants have?  The most meticulous man concerned with self-preservation will still eventually die.  That could be because of bad genetics, a bad environment, ""acts of God"" like flooding and hurricanes, starvation, or just dying because his body has a shelf life.  This applies to all living things.  There is no original sin which causes our demise.  

> Why do we drink until we feel sick to our stomach? Why do we smoke even though we know it affects our lungs? Why do people have affairs when they are happily married? It is because of our self destructive tendencies.

No.  Like I said, first and foremost, we are animals with the same impulses.  The goal is always the pleasure principle, whether it is to eat to avoid hunger, have sex or take drugs because of the release of endorphins, etc.  Biological.  Yes, humans can manipulate the pleasure principle through our minds and actually create a physiological response to release endorphins (e.g., listening to music), but no one has self-destructive tendencies.  Don't confuse alcoholism and withdrawal symptoms with wanting to self-destruct.  The need is to make pain go away whether it's mental or physical, and drugs do the job (with consequences).  

> For Lena, she was having an affair with her colleague. These are forms of self-destruction. Kane's knowledge of the affair led to him volunteering for the mission into the Shimmer which was basically suicide.

These are very simplistic motivations.  The author or director may have had to spoon-feed us these motivations because they aren't very believable otherwise.  I would think as scientists, just like Space Shuttle astronauts, they may want to know what's out there.  I don't think astronauts have a death wish any more than they do.",7zqsdy

 Why did aliens let shimmer end so unremarkably with a incidirary grenade that somehow travled through network of shimmer area and dissapeared. It seemed doubtful that aliens so advanced could be defeated so easily. Was it to let them go intentionally? If so why? It seemed TOO easy.

For my part, what I talked about coming out of the theater was just the nature of life as constant change. Evolution comes out of so many abortive attempts and strangeness, and so much more destruction and death than success, but in the long term becomes beautiful and diverse with those other things hidden. Life is not squirrels and deer and trees, but their parts, which if left alone will morph into something totally alien when it suits them.

 Natural selection favors the capacity for change. Hox genes, mentioned in the movie, which allow body parts to mix and match. Also sexual reproduction which allows more variation per generation, and other things that allow organisms not just to be good in any one situation, but to change on a dime when the environment changes.

When you take a step back, life is weird and shifty as hell, and taking that step back can be freaky when you realize how different life can be and has been. Even when it's actually us, ancestors and descendants.

It’s the same with Lena and Kane - he’s the ship that’s made of all the new parts and she’s at the stage where she’s the ship that’s been changed but still retains some of its original parts. We have an intuition that Kane’s a ‘clone’ and she’s not, but are we right to think this?

It follows from the film’s theme about cell division - every 7 years (off the top of my head) every cell in your body has been replaced. Every cell in Kane’s body has been replaced, just a lot faster and by a different mechanism. Does that mean he “is” the original Kane or not?

dwampij,"I feel like we’re supposed to think that clone Kane responds how the original one would have - you could see the ‘clones’ were developing/learning fast and Kane’s mimic had enough time to learn the concept of using a camera talking in general.

In a way the film’s showing a “better” version of how humans reproduce. At the end of the day we instinctively want our kids to be somewhat like us  when they grow up (but also their own person). In the film the “better” mechanism causes the clones to a) grow up quicker and b) learn faster, so the way I interpreted it was that Kane’s clone was for all intents and purposes mentally the same as Kane, he’d just “seen some shit” and the original Kane would’ve been just as spaced out if it was him that got out alive.

Look how quickly Lena’s clone developed, from awkwardly mirroring just her movements to looking exactly like her in minutes, it’s clear Kane had more time with his clone. Kane’s coldness when he ‘gets back’ isn’t cause he’s an imperfect copy, it’s because he knows Lena’s been cheating on him. That’s how I interpreted it at least.

The film tricks you, it makes you think Lena cheated because Kane was away which is a bit of a trope, then the twist is that she was cheating anyway and it’s WHY Kane went in to the shimmer. It’s a mind bending film and it is the Alien of our generation in my opinion.",7zqsdy

It's made worse by the fact that there was other illogical ""dumb"" seeming behavior for no reason.

But that's a very interesting part of the story that would explain a lot of the seemingly silly choices. That's exactly my point - leaving it out was a poor decision, imo.

Like - when she examined stuff under a microscope inside the shimmer, she saw really weird shit. If you were to bring back some samples (even if it was via a spoon on a stick), what would they look like? Totally normal? And if that's the case, why was her husband so sick? My guess was that maybe upon leaving the shimmer, any ""altered"" parts of you, maybe just die? But then you'd think even if they sent in say, a mouse, it would come out dead, so like, let's not send in group after group to just die.

Lena noes the bruise while they're in the boats, but the squirmy intestine guy has the tattoo as well. In the moment I thought ""they must have served in the same division"" and assumed that would pay off and then forgot. 

I'm not confident at all in whether or not the Lena at the end is a clone, given that she clearly isn't the Lena that walked in, but is that because she's refracted or because she's remade? I can totally see this movie being a frame by frame pick apart upon home video release.",7zqsdy

I agree it's intentionally ambiguous but I don't think it's without an answer. There is an answer in the books but I'm not sure if Garland decided to use it (He changed quite a bit adapting the story) 

Blade Runner is actually an apt analogy at this point IMO because while it's still debated by fans, Ridley Scott has a canon answer for the movie (and the Final Cut I think greatly shifts it towards his answer) but Philip K Dick has a different canon answer for the book. ",7zqsdy

they send people in because they need to know what is in the shimmer, and how to stop it.  It is growing in size and they have no way to contain it.

They send people because technology doesn't seem work.  They can't receive any signal from any tech that goes in.  Their only chance is to send people and have them report back.

This is all explained when natalie portman arrives at the shimmer.

What if Ventress was an alien from the start and has been there for a long time waiting, Anya pointed out that Ventress doesn't have any friends family or connections. The movie writes that off with the whole her having cancer but that could be a foil. 

2. I have a strong feeling that NotKane was birthed from the hole in Vineguys stomach. When they found vineguy he looked awfully similar to the lighthouse with all the vines and shit. It's possible that death births the life of the clones considering that Ventress essentially becomes Annihilated (phyics wise she was ripped down to her basic molecular form) and then the NotLena clone appears.

Btw, the movie was made before the other two books came out evidently. Plus Garland only read the book once and did not follow some elements of the book, so there could be deviations from the written story and Garland's take on it.

I agree that Alex Garland has given us once again some top shelf science fiction.

I was helped along by analyzing what he did with the earlier Ex Machina (as an unreliable narrator) and therefore was looking for some of the metaphorical symbolism.",7zqsdy

It was obvious Kane's clone was far more advanced than Lena's by its collaboration with Kane. Kane #1 being alive long enough for the clone to ""learn"", fulfilling Kane's dying wish to find Lena, hell even manning the camera and recording his suicide shows the discrepancy in awareness between his clone and Lena's. (Somebody had to press pause!! Haha)

For all we know Kane could have been with his clone for days, weeks, or even months without being aware of it and that alone is what fueled his existential dread. Just think about being in a room with something that is not you, but sharply becomes everything you encompass and everything that holds you together. It would drive most mad. There are hints suggesting at this throughout the movie.

I believe the alien did not posses any motive to make a switch or do anything for that matter except survive, and to survive you need to adapt. 
So no, I believe that is our original Lena at the end and she lied by not telling the whole truth just like she did earlier in the movie with Ventress when she's initially kidnapped.

Otherwise, her losing consciousness temporarily serves no clear purpose, story-wise


>The tape of her husband saying he didn't know who was the real him anymore and killing himself are showing you that's what's going to happen, IMO.

Hang on, you might be onto something - if you watch closely, Lena has a bit of a limp when she's approaching the lighthouse, but no limp when she leaves. Coincidence?!??

Jokes aside... I think that's a fair interpretation but not one I agree with. Garland seems to be very deliberate about what he wants the audience to question, and what he's playing straight - and that whole sequence plays straight to me. If we were supposed to question whether Lena and the copy switched places at any point I think he would have been more explicit - eg. have Lena wake up in a different position/place to where she passed out, have the copy resemble Lena earlier on in the sequence to start blurring the differences between them, or have Lena's appearance start to change to look more like the ""alien"" (similar to how Ventress... or what we assume is Ventress... has a Play-Doh face when Lena first finds her in the tunnel).",7zqsdy

The movie touches a lot on both the characters, and peoples in general, self-destructive tendencies.

She had no impact on the story what so ever and never had any dialogue that gave her depth or value. The psychologist was the same except she did something atleast, she had exposition dialogue!

dwn9gv4,"> So Kane came back after they'd already sent how many teams in? So before that moment they had literally no idea about the nature of the phenomenon so it makes no sense for any of those teams to have had hazmat gear. 

Absurd. When dealing with anything that alters the environment, it makes sense to take precautions. Lena and her team went in after Kane came back. They were not wearing protective gear. It defies credibility.

>  The obvious conclusion they would draw from this is that whatever was making Kane sick was not infectious, viral, or any form of biohazard that would be negated by a hazmat suit.

You take precautions regardless. 

> we can safely assume a hazmat suit would do exactly shit all beyond potentially fuse to their skin and turn them into some sort of hazmat hybrid monstrosity like that gas mask kid in Doctor Who.

The hazmat suit is not alive, so it wouldn't be affected by the ""DNA refraction"" (a totally made up concept and pretty ridiculous-- DNA cannot be refracted like light; if they called the shimmer a mutagen of extraterrestrial origin, I'd be fine with that, with radiation or something distorting transmissions. Still doesn't explain why memory chips and video cameras work inside the shimmer). The hazmat suits would be unaffected by a mutagen and by radiation. Also, that is retconning info, since Lena and team did not know about the effects of the shimmer going in. There would be no reason for them to think the suits would fuse with them. When Kane came out, he looked physically perfect, yet randomly had organ failure. He didn't fuse with his clothes, gun, or anything else he touched.

Why didn't the team step out, or try to step out of the shimmer when they woke up and several days had passed. That alone would be enough to attempt to leave and report back with the data. This whole ""no one has ever gotten out but Kane"" thing would make me, as a member of the team, attempt to defy that to see if there was a literal barrier to exiting immediately. You know, as a scientist, experimenting? 

This movie doesn't really hold up to any scrutiny whatsoever as a sci-fi movie. If it's just a big old allegory, fine, but then I wish it were framed differently so that my expectations were not disappointingly and obnoxiously derailed.

It's hard to articulate but saying the Shimmer is a gauntlet with a ""best version"" in mind is not in line with what it is - which is just an accelerated form of life, and a mirror for what you are.

She had a direct connection with the real world and motivation to go back. The other characters did not. This led to her maintaining her essence, my assumption is that mental stability is a factor that maintains form within the Shimmer (while others became lost, were contorted, or transformed because they were not tied to preservation of themselves in the moment they died). She came to make things right with her husband (feeling more guilt and motivation through the fact she cheated on him), to figure out how to save him, and that maintained her form enough to let her come to the monster (while another literally faded out of existence in the same situation because their motivation was to reach that point and that was it). The monster seeing she made it saw her as a being worth replicating (because of her stability and strength) because she would ensure procreation and survival beyond the egg (the lair) and therefor it copied her...the same for her husband.

It was a metaphor for real life people in a more personal way that the audience member likely projects, while in the movie it manifested physically in why she survived and her backstory gave her the tools to survive through the monster's trial. Other character's exposition showcased why they had no reason to carry on and were lost to the shimmer...in some cases explicitly and other cases you had to look back to what they previously stated and why that might have led to their fate.

On the way she escapes, area x also extends it's borders into the SR. Control goes to find Ghost bird (the biologists duplicate) and they make there way into Area X through some sort of portal in the ocean. From there they get there hands on the biologists last journal entries and find out she's been there for 30 years or so, despite the fact that it's been much less time since ghost bird came back, so basically area x's timeline is super fast and that the environment doesn't necessarily degrade things by some other phenomenon, it's just been degrading for a much longer time than things outside of area x. I know you didn't really ask for any of that, lol, but i found it all pretty interesting.

That's absurd and idiotic.

Ventress directly informs us that *nothing* has ever come out of the shimmer, no matter what they've sent in.

That's an interesting explanation for why, but the one the interview was getting at was the acid blood and the crew's realization of how they cannot use conventional weapons.

If she is indeed the copy, I think this is the most likely scenario.

Her lying about what happened also doesn't indicate some ""ultimate motivation for the alien"" - it only indicates that this Lena might be aware that revealing her clone nature (again, in the case that she is the clone) might lead to her elimination.

I agree however that the best interpretation is that of a ""real Lena that was altered"" - because this also means that the alien destroyed itself by mimicing her self-destruction.

Which makes more sense than real-Lena just being left behind and dying like her late husband...

You mention God yet only care about real science. That is contradictory in the sense that the study of religion is not part of the course curriculum of any student studying real science. Is the Bible not full of ""FUCKING PHILOSOPHICAL BULLSHIT!""

> no one has self-destructive tendencies. 

This is very subjective. Self-destructive behaviour is heavily studied in Psychology (or is that not a science to you?).",7zqsdy
dw5f9dx,"1. The book this movie is based on features an all female team as well. Would’ve been a bit strange to deviate from that for no reason.

2. My understanding of the electronics is that the nature of the shimmer is that everything inside behaves much differently than outside which causes a scrambling effect. Basically, everything inside is a wave and everything outside is a particle. Inside the waves mesh up and work correctly because they are all waves. Outside everything is a particle so the waves don’t make sense/are scrambled. Not a perfect analogy but you get the idea. 

3. For the rope thing I imagine that the nature of the shimmer prevents that. The book is a bit different with how the crossing works than the movie(forced hypnosis if I remember right). But imagine if you exited and came back in with a rope you would just have another blackout and reawaken days later missing the rope or something to that effect. 

4. I don’t really see the issue with the affair scenes. Plenty of movies show affairs. Would you have even mentioned this scene if it was a white guy? Who cares about interracial sex in 2018? It didn’t break the immersion of the movie or hurt the plot. Who cares?

dvl6ove,"That’s a possibility. And without doubt the shimmer begins to change Lena’s DNA from the moment they enter. But how does this explain Kane?

We see what appears to be the original Kane blow himself up with a grenade on camera. The version of Kane that we see at the end of the movie also has the shimmer in his iris. But we know that this cannot be the original Kane, right?

No one has ever made it out of the shimmer alive, so why would Lena be an exception? 

I think it’s more plausible that no one makes it out of the shimmer alive except for the “clones.” 

But, having said that, I honestly don’t know. Maybe the real Kane made it out and the cloned Kane was the one who blew himself up with the grenade. And maybe your theory that the real Lena and Kane are now alien/human hybrids is true. That’s definitely a possibility.

What's more, Lena can't answer the question in the end from Kane if she's the original.

Alcohol users deploy it regularly: “I was drunk, I didn’t mean to punch you three times in the face.” Alcohol (and LSD) does not transform you into a different person. You are who you were before you got inebriated. I know plenty of people who can drink regularly without ever becoming idiotic, and I know some who cannot. The ones who cannot are not transformed by alcohol. They simply have shitty urges and beliefs and alcohol removes their inhibitions and smears their perceptions a bit and it all comes out. Nobody makes them drink. They do it to themselves. 

Conversely, I’ve taken LSD probably a dozen times, usually with friends, and those friends have all taken LSD with other friends, about as many times. I have acquaintances who share their own experiences with the drug. Not one of these doses resulted in violence. It’s so preposterously rare to hear about. You take LSD with a great deal of respect and awareness.

I saw it as more of a newborn, it found something that it roughly resembled and was trying to imprint on it, and follow them if they ran so it could continue to imprint, it needed something to learn from. They start very simply mirroring and following, and then they learn additional human traits if exposed to them. The Kane clone eventually learned speech from Kane and having no other impetus, did what Kane asked it to do, find Lena. The Kane clone didn't do anything bad, the Lena clone only did violent or forceful things because Lena herself did something that led to them, i/e punching her in the face when she tried to punch it, or running right into a door. It continued to pin her because she kept struggling because it had pinned her. When she went slack and relaxed so did the alien. I think this speaks more about Lena as a character, she just assumed it was bad, so she shot it and did dumb panicky things. The Kane clone seemed pretty chill. 

The only reason the Kane clone ""replaced"" him was because Kane asked it to find Lena and it was too dumb to do anything else, like a newborn. Nothing evil about them, like a newborn, they just aren't capable of complex though (yet).

e0goyy1,"It doesn't have to be the same type of movie, I'm talking about any movie that has a story and most do. My point about art applies to any medium or genre. No, not all things need to be treated the same way, but all the great stories are told with clarity which is why they have lasted so long and are retold in different forms so many times. Because they are understood by so many different cultures from different times. A lot of people also loved the transformer movies and worship the Twilight movies so I consider niche to be a con more than a pro. Sure you can get more exclusive with your story, but inside jokes and innuendo between close friends loses any power outside the group. Mass appeal sounds like a dirty word and has connotations of ""dumbing something down"", but increasing clarity doesn't always have to come at the cost of meaning or impact or any values you would attribute to a work of art. Can we at least both agree that this movie is good because of its ideas and themes and not how well it obscures those ideas more than most mainstream movies?",7zqsdy

There are films that spoon-feed answers and some that don't. Sometimes they're justified in the methodology, sometimes they're not. I feel that Annihilation has enough answers to the questions it raises to communicate it's themes, but I get that not everybody will feel the same way. 

Honestly I more want to clear up what a plot hole is. Plot holes are generally logic leaps without established rules. Annihilation is equally reliant on its themes as it is its plot, if not moreso. That obviously wouldn't excuse actual plot holes (e.g. imagine if Lena were to just randomly mention that she has three kids with Kane who serve as her motivation to enter the shimmer and save the world), but the film has already arguably established that not everything related to the shimmer makes sense. Even Lena herself states the growth of mutiple different forms of flora from a single plant to be 'impossible'. Therefore the shimmer is a representation of a theme, rather than direct science.

dwkwfd4,"I think your confusing symbolism with themes and expecting something from the film that you're not going to get because it's not that sort of film. The purpose of the way these characters interact with the shimmer is that that is what the film's about, I mean the direct implication (With how the psychologist for example interacts with the entity compared to physicist for example) is that your mutations are tied to your mindset, emotional state, physical state etc. (Hence why the bear inherited Shepherd's voice) and these things define how the characters interact with the shimmer and it's effects. That's what confuses me about this being such a big deal for you, the side characters have as much going on as they need to - they each have something that led them to the events of the film and those something's define what happens to them as the film goes on. If you want to be cynical about it their purpose is for each of them to die in different ways but again, the ways in which they die inform our understandings of the workings of the shimmer and dictate the actions of lour protagonist to a certain extent, what else exactly did you want? Perhaps some details on each character's favourite colour? A scene in which they discuss their favourite and least favourite bands? 

> The alien overall brought nothing to the plot. 

Other than the basis of the entire story and the mystery that motivates the entire journey ¬_¬

Like you seem to be saying everything is one dimensional, but my favourite thing about this movie is how much there is to think about, little details scattered about that make me wonder and want to revisit it, little things I didn't pick up the first time, for example what's the stuff growing up the side of the light house? I thought maybe it was just some sort of plant, maybe coming out the basement but on closer inspection it looks suspiciously like a human nervous system, so maybe that's the warden who was first to check the light house that they mention at the start, or the fact that the Kane clone is wearing the exact same clothes that real Kane left their house in but in the video when he kills himself the clone is wearing his uniform. The fact that this kind of thing is still on mind kind of flies in the face of your ""The alien brought nothing to the plot""  comment imho too but to each their own. 

I just like movies that make me think, this one did and the issues you have with it seem to me to border on nit picky and boil down to ""It's not exactly like these other movies that I like."" ",7zqsdy
dwnhw9g,"Your comment was so fucking awful that my reply became too long for one comment SO NOW IT'S TWO COMMENTS MOTHERFUCKER.

> When dealing with anything that alters the environment, it makes sense to take precautions. Lena and her team went in after Kane came back. They were not wearing protective gear. It defies credibility.

How do they know it's altering the environment? It's pretty clear that they know basically nothing about the shimmer other than that they can't retrieve anything from it. And you mention Kane coming back so they should have taken protective gear, Kane didn't have a scratch on him, as you point out he was completely fine when he got home and then just started to die, we have to assume they found no infection, or, maybe they did, maybe the organisation was simply not putting any value on the human life in putting them in, maybe we and Lena are not told everything, this was the case in the book, it's either implied or directly revealed that the purpose of the mission is more experimentation than anything (I haven't read it but read some of the synopsis, I wanna read the actual book now incidentally) maybe that's the case. I however have another theory, it's implied a number of times and in many ways that the Southern Reach in the film is kind of poorly run / has a sense of defeatism in relation to the shimmer, examples: the cynical way that the team members describe their jobs on the project, what does Shepard say? ""It's like using confetti to test a hurricane."", Thorensen's only on the project because she got flagged (Presumably due to her history of drug use) and Raddock's essentially got no qualifications, she's literally just been plucked from a university, maybe just so she can go on this mission. It's even possible that Ventress' only motivation for this mission was that she was dying she wanted to see what was going on on the other side of the shimmer, if that's the case the fact that she was able to do that says something about the organisation.

Other hint, the guard on Kane is sleeping on the job despite being in a hazmat suit, which implies that they had an actual quarantine on Kane at that point and clearly it wasn't very well enforced since Lena's able to sneak in no problem.

I'm pretty sure there are other hints towards this, I'm not sure if it's a metaphor for something, maybe climate change, but it is definitely a choice. Btw the fact that the movie allows for this much theory crafting is part of the reason why I like really really like it.

> You take precautions regardless.

I'm sorry but I think you're failing to consider the practicality of this situation and the potential for them to have hazmat suits in those big fucking back packs they're wearing for the entire movie. 

The environment's clearly warm inside the shimmer, if they had been made to wear hazmat suits they would have taken them off very quick. If they're going to be in there for a long time too, which is a given what with the time dilation and all, I mean I guess they don't know about that at that point, we'll get to it, the point I was getting to is how do sleep in a hazmat suit? You can't, out in nature like that with no roads it's gonna get fucked up very quickly, and consider as well, the assumption they're making is that there is physical danger inside the shimmer since nobody comes back out, why else do you think they have guns on a scientific expedition? Remind me, are hazmat suits known for their maneuverability, durability, and the sublime visibility they provide for, say, shooting a moving target? No, they make all those things really fucking difficult so why would they lower their chances of survival in that situation? You can't find me a person that's going to go along with that. 

> he hazmat suit is not alive, so it wouldn't be affected by the ""DNA refraction""

So this is the point where you either start willfully ignoring things I've said or you suffer from some form of spontaneous lost consciousness (Similar to what the team experiences when they enter the shimmer *Oh how astute*). I mentioned previously if you'll scroll the six or so inches up the page to where I said it, the shimmer's effects are clearly not reserved only to organic matter and beings, I noted the lighthouse as an example I believe, and the sunken shack where they meet the crocodile and I realised another one after I posted actually, Lena and Kane's house is in the shimmer, same layout, different paintwork, same house, the implication seems rather clearly that the shimmer produced that from either Lena or more likely Kane's memories as with the tattoo or Kane's memories to his clone. 

So as we bare this in mind your brain dump of - 

> (a totally made up concept and pretty ridiculous-- DNA cannot be refracted like light; if they called the shimmer a mutagen of extraterrestrial origin, I'd be fine with that, with radiation or something distorting transmissions. Still doesn't explain why memory chips and video cameras work inside the shimmer).

Is evident in it's rampant stupidity in missing the point.

Let me spell it out for you.

**The physicist uses a physics based metaphor to describe what she sees the shimmer doing.**

That is all it is.

A metaphor that describes what the shimmer does in a way that a laymen can understand. Next you'll be complaining about how using that metaphor is completely in keeping with her character.

I'm sorry that you took what she said in that scene as a literal scientific observation, despite her coming to it without any equipment or note taking. She noticed a pattern in what they were seeing: individual elements from separate species are mixing together, merging, splitting off, creating new things. Lena describes it early on as hyper evolution I believe, Raddock, also being in charge of communications, realise their messages from inside and outside the shimmer aren't blocked but scrambled, kind of like what's happening with the animals. I'm struggling to tell if you are as dense as a black hole or being willingly obtuse for the sake of an argument, I hope it is the latter.

> The hazmat suits would be unaffected by a mutagen and by radiation. 

And this goes back to a point I've made to some one else flowing their shitey ideas at me in here, you're assuming that the shimmer can be categorised as anything we currently understand in science when it's something so extremely alien. I am a big fan of cosmic horror and the shimmer in this reminded me alot of The Colour out of Space, do you nitpick the unclear ways of the colour's mechanics despite it being the point in that story too?

> Also, that is retconning info, since Lena and team did not know about the effects of the shimmer going in. There would be no reason for them to think the suits would fuse with them. 

I'm not saying there's a reason for them to think that, there's a reason for me to think that, although on reflection it'd be something more like dying all their hair high vis yellow or them growing oxygen tanks on their hips. Read better please. 

> When Kane came out, he looked physically perfect, yet randomly had organ failure. He didn't fuse with his clothes, gun, or anything else he touched. 

Well you probably didn't notice this but clone Kane is wearing the exact clothes real Kane was wearing when he left the house to go on the mission, but in the final video clone Kane is wearing an army uniform, same as real Kane. That's obviously not fusing to him (I said that more as a joke tbh on account of talking to you being a miserable fucking experience) but the shimmer's clearly able to make clothes, echoes, as Natalie Portman says. 

> Why didn't the team step out, or try to step out of the shimmer when they woke up and several days had passed.

You're assuming that they haven't tried that already on previous expeditions, while I would say that the fact that this expeditions objective is to reach the lighthouse i.e. the epicenter, they've probably wasted a lot of resources at that point trying to get literally anything out. 

Now you ask why it's never worked.

dvlcdh6,"I'm leaning towards the hybrid theory. The moment they touch is probably the moment they sort of fuse/share each other. 
Both Kane and Lena share the shimmer in their eyes at the end of the movie. 
Both Kane and Lena's clones no longer ""mirror"" each other after they become alike, in Lena's case after they touch. Seems like at that point it does not matter anymore if one dies. Maybe there's no preference of one over the other after that?
That does not explain why it didn't happen first, when Lena was pressed against the door by the metalic clone. Maybe it has to be voluntary in some way?
There are those shots of their hands through the water glass, Kanes at the begining and Lenas at the end of the movie, where they refract the light, and the image is in reverse for both of them, that suggest they went through the same transformation as well.

dw8o9mq,"OK. Some details in this movie might be explained away or just flat ignored for the sake of higher message or enjoyment or whatever. I'm ok with that.  
  
But just for the sake of realism/immersion I reject it even if what you say is true. If they didn't expect to need weapons, no sane military or govt project leader running an outpost would hand military grade rifles to anyone with no rifle qualifications just like it was normal. If it was a just-in-case type of scenario they might get a handgun. So maybe she was insane? But I think it was a power statement.      
   
I think there was a purposeful thing they did there with the 5 women all carrying rifles uniformly in the beginning but it fell flat because of these details. A rifle isn't the easiest thing to tote, especially in a swamp, you have to keep it dry. I can understand having Portman's character armed if it's her preference, but they acted like anyone can pick up a rifle, strap on gear, carry it through a jungle and use it- a huge myth that's been busted over and over. They march non-nonchalantly into almost certain death without even a helmet on.  
  
They took the ""hear me roar"" stuff a little too far. I can recall many movies in which characters would debate giving an untrained person a gun or like you said scientists with some type of armed escort and/or training. Think Stargate or Jurassic Park or the Matrix even. It's super common. This seemed like a cheesy move for the sake of the rhetoric of the movie. I couldn't get passed it. ",7zqsdy

If they had shown the Shimmer to literally bend the rules of space and time, then yea I'd throw my hands up and say ""anything can happen so Kane was probably magically healed by X"". They didn't show that. They showed the Shimmer to be a phenomena that distorts instrumentation, time, and genetic code. That's all we have to go on.

1) There's no good explanation (without utilizing magical thinking) for how/why Kane's clone has organ failure, and then at the end, magically recovers.

You say you like movies that make you think. I agree. I also like movies with interesting plots and stories. Stories that have logical & depthful characters and an exciting plot.

My issue with this movie is that it only ticks one box, that it only makes you think. But it makes me think and nothing else.

> That alone would be enough to attempt to leave and report back with the data. This whole ""no one has ever gotten out but Kane"" thing would make me, as a member of the team, attempt to defy that to see if there was a literal barrier to exiting immediately. You know, as a scientist, experimenting? 

Or... you kind of do, *sighs*.

Let's assume that what happens to the team in the film happens in every instance - loss of awareness and suddenly you're just somewhere. If we assume that when this has happened to other teams, including those whose objective it was to step in and step right back out, then the movie has handed you an explanation for this nitpicking on a silver fucking platter, don't yell at me for you not realising it. Maybe you'll ask about why that might be, either they enter a sort of controlled state of autopilot where the entity just puts them in the direction of the lighthouse and far enough away from the edge to where they'll never find it again, perhaps due to spacial fuckery like we see with Lena's house, previously mentioned above if you skipped it because you clearly hate reading enough to only do it selectively with these comments. It's true this isn't explored in the film, and that makes me sad and is perhaps to the films detriment. I am also curious about what would happen if you just stuck someone on a winch as they went in and then tried to pull them out, but again you've got to assume they've tried that three years ago when this thing first started and it didn't work. Y'know what, I'll give you the lack of having characters actively attempt to exit the shimmer at any point is a failing of the script, they could have had Rodriguez and Radeck try and get out and fail by whatever means the shimmer employs instead of that admittedly kind of stupid moment where Rodriguez ties them all up, I mean you can theory craft about why she does that too, but yeah, I agree the movie would have been better if they had explored the aspect of actually trying to leave in someway, instead of it just being a given that they all accept.

> This movie doesn't really hold up to any scrutiny whatsoever as a sci-fi movie.

Not in your expectations of what a sci-fi film should be, no, but I would say it's more a cosmic horror with sci-fi elements. 

> Fixing the beginning so it doesn't strain my willing suspension of disbelief to breaking, and explaining the effects of the shimmer so they aren't so laughably unscientific, would not have been hard.

I suppose not, I mean it would have meant literally more filming and writing and editing and all these things are not easy but sure, it's something they could have done. But doing all those things would have inextricably changed the movie into something very different from what it is, and it seems to me that you're complaining more about how it was different from what you expected than actual problems with the film. 

The issues you flag up are creative choices that lead the film to deviate from what you wanted it to be, this does not make them mistakes or problems, just things you didn't expect and I suppose didn't like? I'm glad you liked the ending though! Hopefully your will to continue arguing is crushed by this wall of text.

e0g6fjk,Well the understanding is you would retain the moment of exposition throughout the narrative. Simply because they didn't remind you of that exact line of exposition before the event that it impacts doesn't mean it's a bad narrative...it just means it asked more of you than other narratives in order to get why that mattered. I think the physical ways people died represented their exposition and backstory and therefor differentiated the protagonist from similar but ultimately different people in the same situation. I think the fact she was copied and not others in her party says something about her backstory in relation to the monster and the event caused by (or even designed by) the monster...etc. I didn't mean you could only understand it by literally re-watching a moment...you just had to remember it. Nothing was out of sequence and information given prior came up after. There was nothing within the movie that required a plot point divulged later to understand the narrative prior to that event. It just required memory and didn't bother to remind you of that exactly before that previous information factored into the plot. I think upon rewatching it you tend to focus more on the exposition than on the tension that builds and trying to decode what is going on...this allows you more mental capacity to make links you didn't prior and understand actions in a fuller way.,7zqsdy

What's significant about Lena and Kane's marriage isn't just that it's disintegrating, but that its disintegration, the consequences of it, and the motivations stemming from it, are all reflected in the 'event'/shimmer/Area X phenomenon.  

The book is named 'annihilation' for two reasons: 1) it's a hypnotic suggestion pre-programmed into the team by the psychologist to induce immediate suicide, and 2) the 'crawler', essentially the locus of the Area X phenomenon in the book, is [compared to a starfish that devours everything around it](https://boingboing.net/2014/11/12/describing-the-indescribable-w.html)...in the first book at least (haven't read the others) the phenomenon is most definitely malevolent.  In the movie, 'annihilation' refers to how the psychologist characterized the Area X phenomenon, likely mirroring her own terminal cancer and how it was going to destroy her, and so she gets annihilated...it does NOT necessarily refer to an 'objective' description of the phenomenon, and likely its reactions to Lena were not about annihilation at all, but rather what she noted herself, about change and mirroring.  

My point here is that 'Annihilation' as a name for the movie might be a bit of a misnomer, as what's actually going on is change and evolution.  This is true of the Area X phenomenon, and is true of Lena and Kane's marriage as well.  ",7zqsdy

I said that the idea that SIMPLY LEARNING A LANGUAGE (without altering your brain in anyway, introducing alien technology or processes, etc.) - could enable time-travel - is absurd.

Your ability to understand this simple distinction is non-existent.

There is a difference between suggesting that time-travel (or any other ""weird phenomenon"") is facilitated by: alien technology, alien processes, other-worldly effects, etc.

and between suggesting that grammar and vocabulary have a magical power to alter plain, ordinary human brains - to the point where they gain super-powers.
That isn't sci-fi anymore, that's fantasy. that's simply ""magic"".

to believe that this is ""sci-fi"" - you'd have to believe that this is actually possible even now --- just given the right grammar and vocabulary, and that we simply haven't discovered those yet.

Again, this is an absurd thing to believe, whether in reality or in film.

It's a dumb concept.

Languages don't grant super-powers, 

Aliens COULD hypothetically have a technology or capacities that interact with physical or biological elements in ways we cannot easily understand (but could accept as at least possible in principle).

duv41a8,"> It wouldn’t have been the same if some random creature that’s never been introduced before attacked them.

This is my point. No, it wouldn't have been, but the fact that it isn't is entirely dependent on the reveal, not the scenes that precede it. 

We're only shown a glimpse, they show the body, they talk about it after the fact. Great, none of that provides a reason to feel like it's still part of the movie moving forward any more than the alligator (other than the alligator being dead of course).

Personally, I chalked it up to further establishing that the environment was hostile and weird and that was that, more about the loss of the individual than the thing responsible. The bear was completely out my mind by the time they reached the house, just something that happened and no longer part of the movie. 

It's good that they did do more than that as it made for a great scene, but until that moment there is no reason to care about the bear, the focus is on the threat of the environment as a whole, not any build up over that specific creature. It's only made relevant in hindsight and that's kind of the opposite of buildup.

duv5n0k,In the book they hear the creatures moaning in the background at various times. It would have been easy to include that to know that it was in fact stalking them. ,7zqsdy
dvt7rgc,"Hah, thanks! Yeah I do think taste is a big part of it. Personally, it's not uncommon for in-movie (in-game, in-book, etc.) explanations for why [x] can't or doesn't happen to be an unsatisfactory explanation for me. I much prefer giving me the tools to come up with my own explanation than providing a weak one. It's inevitably difficult for me to have serious issues with an explanation that I come up with on my own. No explanation is better than a bad explanation.",7zqsdy
dv27go7,"I totally disagree with this. I think the its all the same but has varying levels of effects depending on how close to the source you are. Its not like the alligator had bird dna or something completely different. Shark/alligator are both aquatic creatures, the flowers had different species of flowers, the bear/pig are both land animals and had the voice of something it came in contact with. All the instances of strange transformations we saw had one thing in common and that was that the mixings seem to be based on things in close proximity or that could have been in close proximity at one point (if you didn't see it on screen). I think its completely baseless to say that the alien changing was ""active"" while everything else was passive. Even when Josie decided she wanted to stay in the shimmer she immediately started turning into the human plant (the same ones that happened to be VERY CLOSE in proximity to her current location) That seems like a pretty active transformation to me and not passive at all.

dvv78gf,"I don't see how this is ""rudimentary"". Yes, of course we can always make any number of convenient ad-hoc rules that make a specific setting work. But suspension of disbelief, and plots in general, work better when the rules are simple and clearly defined. Not to say that vague rules can't work - the best example being things like magic in Lord Of The Rings, where there's no clear cut stuff like in Harry Potter, just a generic notion of some people being ""powerful"". But they have to mesh with the setting, and this setting seems more geared towards sci-fi, and giving semi-plausible scientific-sounding explanations to stuff. So it becomes natural to evaluate the details a bit more critically, the movie itself primes you to do it with its general atmosphere.",7zqsdy

dw40yxd,"sounds like you're an underdeveloped man-child

most modern residents of the civilized world don't share your prudish sensitivities about worrying about nudity in film.

Nudity and sex are a part of life.

You might say you don't normally watch other peoples' sex-lives, but then again - you normally don't visit their houses, see them in hospitals, fight scenes, working (in fields of work that aren't yours, etc.) - in other words, it shows a lot of things that you're not typically exposed to in your normal routine

but that's the nature of a story, it shows you a tale about characters that aren't you

and some of the things that happen to them are sex.

You're the one who mentioned your relatives, idiot.
So don't ask others to ""leave them out of this"" if you decide to mention them as part of your argument.

You said the reason you think sex should be absent from film is so that you could show it to your relatives. But that's exactly why ""ratings"" exist for films - so that it would be clear which films are fit for which type of audience. 

Unfortunately - there is no rating for ""Prudish racist morons"", so you'd have to use the existing ones.

By the way, i find your username to be quite ironic, and makes me wonder if you're actually just a troll.",7zqsdy
dw3xqw2,"> **For me**, chopping heads are okay, just not giving head.

> **I don't** want any sex scenes. 

Sexual Intercourse is a natural part of biology. Deal with it. Maybe close your eyes during these scenes next time.

Blade Runner 2049, Basic Instinct, Gone Girl, Mulholland Drive, Top Gun, American Psycho, Troy... I could keep going.

All of these must be terrible films, ruined because pointless sex scenes were included. 

> Acts of God = natural disasters. Real events with scientific explanations for them.

The phrase ""act of God"" is sometimes used to attribute an event to divine intervention. Divine Intervention? Sounds like some ""FUCKING PHILOSOPHICAL BULLSHIT!"" to me.

Don't let your subjective perspective on things such as sex, philosophy and gender dictate whether a film is good or bad. Scientists themselves try to be as objective as possible.

According to what you've mentioned previously, a good film doesn't have pointless sex scenes, is not philosophical, is only concerned with real science, doesn't contain an all female cast and spoon feeds you everything leaving no question unanswered. Did I forget anything?",7zqsdy
