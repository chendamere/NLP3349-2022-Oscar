hky8unc,"‚ÄúGo. Now. Don‚Äôt look back. I love you, son.‚Äù

As the credits rolled I felt this wave of emotion well up inside me and I shed tears as the lights came up. I didn‚Äôt love it, I had some issues with tone mostly. But the characters were rich and the story was simple and lovely and by the end it had all just snuck up on me.",qs2ai3
hkazgrg,"Beautiful film, loved every minute of it and it captured the feeling of growing up somewhere your whole life and wanting to leave it and wanting to stay. And Caitriona was beautiful just so stunning in this.",qs2ai3
hkcah6d,This is a beautiful movie. I loved the B&W cinematography and direction. Jude Hill was such a find. The whole supporting cast was amazing but Balfe and Hinds were the standouts for me. I hope people see this movie and it doesn‚Äôt lose its Oscar buzz. It is hard to walk away from this movie and not have it stay with you.,qs2ai3

hkfxbp2,"Ciaran Hinds is one of my favorite character actors and, like so many other character actors, he tends to fly under the radar more often than not, so I‚Äôm thrilled to see the acclaim he‚Äôs getting for this film. I don‚Äôt know if it will turn into awards recognition or not, but at least it‚Äôs recognition.",qs2ai3

hkainhv,"Just had to throw the Thor comic in there, eh Kenneth?

I really enjoyed this movie! The Everlasting Love scene with the father and mother was amazing. Such a joyous scene. The acting all around was awesome, especially the kid actor. I think it will get plenty of Oscars love.",qs2ai3
hl1w4yq,"Just got back from seeing this film. I really liked it, but I didn't love it. It reminds me very strongly of Alfonso Cuar√≥n's ""Roma."" Both are reminiscences of a filmmakers' childhoods shot in Black and White, and there are even some shots that are very similar. but I just didn't connect with this one as much. There are some great scenes and sequences, but it also felt very paint-by-numbers at times. Like I was too consciously aware of the film's attempts to evoke emotion in the audience. The film's climax felt similarly artificial to me.

Ciar√°n Hinds and Judy Dench are brilliant as always, though. Every time they're on screen there's this warmth and nostalgia emanating off of the screen. I just wish the rest of the film was as magnetic.",qs2ai3
hp5ee9a,"Unfortunately not seeing the hype.  Its not awful but its not special.  Mostly boring. Cute kid but a lot of random scenes and just reminded me of superior movies.  Sometimes I would be thinking of 400 blows, roma, cinema paradiso, or how Wes Anderson would handle this.  And the tone is eh.

Also out of the black and white films this year, the cinematography isn‚Äôt anything special. Its the first film this year where i felt the b&w was more gimmicky and forceful of the look i am an arthouse film.

But idk, its being praised by everyone and in some people‚Äôs top 5, but eh I wouldn‚Äôt revisit it.",qs2ai3
hkamfq7,I‚Äôm not sure any woman in the history of black and white cinema was shot more beautifully than Caitriona Balfe in that Everlasting Love sequence.,qs2ai3
hkc34x0,"A beautiful film, full of heart, love and whimsy. *Belfast* expertly showcases the gravitas of the period through the worldly-innocent viewpoint of a child. The acting is stellar across the board, but I was especially impressed with Hinds and Balfe. Bragnah‚Äôs directing was truly wonderful, and there were a few shots that especially ‚Äúwowed‚Äù me (one of them being of the family sitting on the couch staring blankly at the box of washing powder). It‚Äôd be a truly worthy Best Picture winner, if there ever was one.",qs2ai3
hkas74h,Great film. Loved the soundtrack and the opening shot of modern day Belfast in color.,qs2ai3
hkaucqe,"""Belfast"" is terrific.

Branagh's film - as much about the immigrant experience as it is specifically about The Troubles - struck an atavistic cord. 

This is raw emotional territory and Branagh tells it with compassion and tenderness. The texture of the location is felt through the beautifully-observed gallery of character dynamics while the cast is uniformly excellent.

Dornan and Balfe prove themselves again to be more than pretty faces while Dench and Hinds are superb once again.",qs2ai3
hkf20u2,The best year that I have seen so far.  I was starting to think that this might be a bad movie year since Dune was #1 on my best of the year list.  I am glad to have the far better Belfast as #1.,qs2ai3
hkdomal,"Maybe unpopular, but I think the choice of Black and White *really* hurt the movie.

For as much as this was billed as Branagh's ""deeply personal love letter"" to Belfast, I left the movie feeling like I didn't have a super clear picture of what Belfast actually looks or feels like.  I think putting it in Black and White dampened the city a bit and made it hard to really get lost in it.  The choice to have lots of American pop and Soul music on the soundtrack also felt odd to me, as it made it feel much more like a generic late-60's nostalgia movie than something specific to Northern Ireland.

I liked the movie overall, but I definitely wasn't as drawn into the world of the film as I had hoped I would be.",qs2ai3
hkbnh6d,"I absolutely loved this movie.  The whole ‚Äúmain‚Äù cast did a great job, but especially Balfe. In any other year, she would be a shoe in for an Oscar.  I usually think child actors are hit and miss, but Hill really does a great job.  The movie walks a tight rope the entire way through, pulling on your heart in every direction, and painting the tense, dangerous times through the innocent eyes of a young kid who just wants to have fun and love.  This has become very easily one of the best movies I‚Äôve seen this year, and I‚Äôll be seeing this again, and again.",qs2ai3
hkg4hfs,"So much of this film was great. The performances, the passion from Branagh in the story, the photography. But I feel the story didn‚Äôt quite fully come together as well as it could have.",qs2ai3
hkicv82,"I thought this was spectacular. It's touching, the performances are mostly great (I could have used a better performance as Billy Clanton, but other than that I think the casting is pretty flawless), and it looks great. But the trailers didn't prepare me for how funny it was. I don't know how this year's crop of nominees will turn out, but I liked this more than any movie that was in the awards conversation last year.",qs2ai3
hl34rsu,Hinds and Dench CRUSHED this movie. Absolutely loved them.,qs2ai3
hm8mt0p,"I enjoyed the movie. The scenes with the boy and his grandfather were very simple but charming. Some of the other 'slice-of-life' moments were great too. 

My criticism is that the first scene of the riots was very well done and felt pretty jarring. But it felt pretty weak how the follow up to that throughout the movie is just the one bad guy harassing his dad. Sure, there was the barricaded street but not much every really comes from that. It just seems out of place to start the film that way when nothing really comes close to matching it in the rest of the movie (including the looting scene).",qs2ai3
hkset4t,"Really enjoyed Belfast, I wasn‚Äôt expecting to laugh as much as I did during this, and the performances were great all around. The Everlasting Love scene was definitely a standout for me and the Thor reference was the cherry on top",qs2ai3
hkcvji6,"I am so looking forward to seeing this tomorrow, but I must ask, do either of the grandparents die? I just need to be slightly prepared if so.",qs2ai3
hpq19x4,What a shit movie godamn. Another one of those oscar contenders that is just so boring and predictable. Jamie dornan or whatever was so unconvincing,qs2ai3
hkejcxr,"One of my favorite movies of the year. What really worked for me was how well the movie captured the innocence of a childhood invaded by tumultuous times. The way they framed the boy listening to his parents from around the corner or the top of the stairs, or hearing his family talking about kids being killed around the corner really spoke to me. It reminded me of the time around 9/11, being old enough to start to understand the hurt and pain in the world, but young enough to feel like your parents had the answers and everything would be ok.",qs2ai3
hkt4vi9,"Could've used the wee subtitles in certain scenes and hopefully will be able to do a second watch with it, overall enjoyable! would've liked to see more of the older brothers POV also, but oh well! I love wholesome relationships between kids&parents&grandparents üíû",qs2ai3
hmzrrqw,"Good movie, doesn't really feel like the Best Picture winner it's being hyped as though. Beautifully shot, strong performances, and yet felt a bit... slight from a scripting perspective?",qs2ai3
hvods0b,"The kid had a black teacher? And a black police officer investigated the riot in the street? So now we are rewriting history? Why?

And it is quite antiseptic, everyone is clean, little swearing, square people. We know who the good guys are. About as binary as God isn't Dead. Like a Hallmark Channel production.

Watch In the Name of the Father (1993) instead.

hki5ioc,"Probably sacrilege but Judi Dench is miscast. She's almost 20 years older than Ciar√°n Hinds, and feels more like his mum in this than his wife. If Branagh wanted to work with her yet again, it'd make more sense if she was Buddy's great-grandmother, then her saying goodbye to her family after the loss of Pop would be more touching.

It's exactly as bland and audience-pleasing as the ""stereotypical"" Best Picture winner would be. I like it, but it didn't feel like anything special, which is disappointing because I'm a huge fan of Kenneth Branagh. I think the only performer that comes close to deserving award recognition for their performance is Ciar√°n Hinds.

In terms of 2021 films where Jamie Dornan has a musical number, I prefer Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar.",qs2ai3

hkb4550,Why can't I watch this in the UK yet?,qs2ai3
hqel3ca,"Is this my favourite film ever? No. Is it an immensely charming and solid film designed to evoke a certain emotion for a certain audience? Yes.

This is something I can see students of film studying for many a year to come. It's what I call a 'filmy film'.

This is a film for someone who is an immigrant, or the son/daughter of an immigrant, this will connect with them far more than anyone who has stayed in one place all their life like me, I can understand that perhaps this film is not even *for* me specifically. It's a personal project.

As good as Judi Dench was, I found her accent to be lacking, made worse by having many Belfast natives surrounding her. She brings enough heat that it's easy enough to overlook, but when you have an accent as distinct as an Ulster accent it will certainly stand out, especially if you're already used to it.",qs2ai3
hkjiagj,Did not like this at all unfortunately,qs2ai3
hkcsoe7,"I liked it. Very good performances all around (I would nominate at least Hinds and Dornan for Best Supporting Actor). Beautifully filmed. Very cute. An idealized family story.

It did feel like it was pandering (not quite the right word) quite a lot, at least for my taste. For instance:

All the moments about the togetherness of enjoying corny movies felt a bit gratuitous and as if it was trying extra hard to pat the industry on the back to bring it home

Likewise, when the dad starts singing ""Everlasting Love,"" it seemed a bit calculated as a feel-good moment for an older audience to me

When the dad thanks and credits the mom for raising the boys, the way he said it felt a bit anachronistic, feminist, sticking in praise of single moms. Like he was almost about to say that she should get reparations for emotional labor

Judi Dench's ending lines and the dedication at the end felt especially sentimental and laid on too thick. Would personally have preferred it without this

I would have liked a bit more context about the political situation, I think. From this movie, everyone is getting along in a close-knit community until a thuggish militia suddenly appears in 1969. The idealized dad seems open minded, tolerant and apolitical. I don't know if the atmosphere in Northern Island was really like that.",qs2ai3
hkcs8hk,"Got to see it Monday in a small group, probably my favorite movie of the year. This movie is full of charm.",qs2ai3

hn7vfyv,"Late to the party, but why was the Christmas Carol play in color?  I didn't understand the significance of that.",qs2ai3
hwl47dq,I honestly thought this movie was terrible. I kept waiting for it to get good and it never did. I felt it was just pretentious Oscar bait. I hated that it was black and white and the way it was filmed was irritating. The story totally has potential and the cast is amazing! Caitriona Balf is fantastic. But the way the film was written and edited never gave her a chance to truly shine. She‚Äôs the only thing about this movie that‚Äôs Oscar-worthy and she didn‚Äôt even get a nom. Total waste of time and I really wanted to love it. Maybe I‚Äôm just not ‚Äúartsy‚Äù enough for it‚Ä¶,qs2ai3
hm7udfn,"Great movie and one of the best of the year! Ciar√°n Hinds & Judi Dench's relationship was the highlight for me but I thought it was very predictable that he was gonna die.

Regardless, this is definitely a top contender for movie of the year. So well made & not a complaint against the movie but I really want to rewatch this with subtitles - accents were thick.",qs2ai3
hmjcfug,"In many ways it feels like an Irish version of Fiddler on the Roof: the struggle of making that very painful decision to leave, mourning the things lost forever, yet doing so for all the right reasons.

hkmiiq6,"Of all the wonderfully articulated things people have already said about this film, I just wanted to add that it's a real movie lover's kind of movie. The scenes of Buddy watching movies whether in the TV or in the theater were so charming and full of life. The use of color in those scenes was an excellent touch. Made me so nostalgic for the way some movies made me filled with awe as a kid. And also I would imagine a lot of people share the childhood experience of being fixated on the TV while also being keenly aware that your parents are fighting about some real shit in the background. 

Also I ugly cried at a lot of the scenes between Buddy and his grandparents, just the sheer innocence of childhood was too pure and nostalgic for me to handle. I think everyone would find something to like in this movie.",qs2ai3
hkgvx4m,"This was a better movie overall, but it was kinda jarring to go from the incredible use of B&W in Passing to this, where it doesn't feel as impactful.

Did anyone go crazy near the end when there's suddenly color in the lower corners of the screen? I'm honestly even still not sure if it was just all in my head",qs2ai3

The good: 

1. Great performances
2. Wonderful cinematography

The bad: 

1. Van Morrison is trash, should be cancelled, and is a shit artist on top of that. Having the movie consist 99.99999% of his music made it not half as enjoyable as it could be. 
2. It's a bit unfocused, and some of the emotional content touching on historical events was a but less effective because, obviously, we know what happens in the conflict.",qs2ai3
hkneadm,"Interesting that the distributor kept this to 580 theaters which is just below the 600 theater wide release threshold.  I guess they weren‚Äôt extremely confident of good box office.

hy87he1,"I would have enjoyed this movie more had I had not gone in to watch it with pre-conceived ideas of what it would be about, the way it was promoted and the name itself led me to believe it would be an accurate representation of life in Belfast as a whole during the troubles. As an Irish protestant who lives in Belfast I am aware of the deep history of the troubles and how complicated it was but this film barely skims the surface of it. The history of Belfast is much more harrowing and frightening than the film hints at. Maybe if it had been promoted as 'The Brannaghs/family name' or something more specific rather than,' Belfast' I would have not come in with these expectations. I guess you wouldn't want to discourage people from coming to Belfast by showing them how it really was as tourism is important here! The film shows Belfast in a good light and shows the cultural kind nature of its people without showing the true dark sides of what happened. Otherwise the film was a heartfelt adaptation of an innocent lucky Irish child's perspective of his childhood on the edge of the troubles.",qs2ai3
i0aw1f0,"Saw it 2 nights ago at the cinema. It was fine, nothing special, but I sure enjoyed it as a movie.

But I lost my grandpa a bit less than 3 weeks ago and the grandpa dying at the end of the movie was really difficult. I was trying really hard to keep myself from full on crying.

hm8vrlk,"I did not care for this movie but I think part of my complaint involves how AMC projected it because the left quarter of the screen had a distinctive blue tint. Plus I started focusing on the grid between pixels which really took me out of the cinematography.

hyvplt5,"The movie wasn't black and white because of the time period, it's because Jamie Dornan made it fifty shades of gray. 

I think more than anything this is about the mindset of being from Belfast. After the opening scene most of the audience probably concludes that this is no place to be raising a kid. The characters themselves eventually reach the same conclusion, but it takes them most of the movie to get there. I've known people who have moved to another city or state when they were these kids' age, and it was over a lot less than potentially being murdered. It takes a really strong attachment to wait this long to get your kids the hell out of there. 

I was kinda surprised that none of the characters with names got murdered in this movie. Usually if there's a short Oscar-nominated film about a violent period it gets cut short with the Dad getting shot. But no, the funeral scene is just grandpa dying of cancer.  

Loved the fire-and-brimstone preacher. Definitely a big part of a kid's life when he first starts hearing the possibility that he'll go to hell. I'm a little more confused by everyone apparently not understanding what a movie is? Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is hardly the first film to use a green screen. I guess the point of this scene is that old crotchety stereotype that Northern Irish people at the movies always be talkin at the screen. 

I'm not surprised there are so many children in Belfast if they start mackin on the fly honeys in their class when they're friggin *nine*. Also that criminal girl is a total bitch, kid spent half the movie in trouble because he didn't learn that she was bad news. Mother of the year over here dragging her kid to a grocery store that's being looted because he stole something. *This is what you get for stealing! You get killed by gangsters!*",qs2ai3
i1or4cu,"the last words ""do it for your son""/ and that sums up the movie. It was if there was only 1 son. I reaize the movie is basically about the author. But making the brother a ghost in essense is odd. I know its not exactly real life because Brannagh had 2 siblings. But in the context of the movie the brother was never around playing with the little brother, or teasing the little brother or interacting with the grandfather or anyone for that matter. I loved the movie but its creepy how 25 percent of the family of 4 has no voice literally. Has no voice when its first floated that they will move to england. Its as if he had zero feeling. emotion, interest.",qs2ai3

Also, whenever you have a deliberately black and white movie, it's obvious that the director is making a blatant point when color appears. For this little boy that would grow up to make and be in movies and plays, that was when he would see a more colorful world.",qs2ai3

The movie spent a lot of time subtly poking fun at the things we identify with and take pride in. The segue of ‚ÄúCatholics are so dramatic‚Äù leading into the sweaty Protestant preacher yelling about two paths into salvation or hell fire. The chair swap when buddy moved into the top 2 only to realize it backfired and he couldn‚Äôt see his crush anymore. The ‚Äúwith us or against‚Äù tension between dad and the dipshit guy who was allegedly on ‚Äúhis side‚Äù of religion.

Belfast as a theme was supposed to be unimportant. It took two instances of her children almost dying for the wife to realize it‚Ä¶

Cities, countries, religions don‚Äôt mean a fucking thing. What matters is those you love. What an incredible, incredible story.

Half the shit regarding the politics side of things was just so unbelievable it pulled me out of the movie. A couple of them were.

The fact that he went to school with a Catholic girl would just never have happened. Even today, nearly all children who go to schools here are segregated, the idea of this happening in the 1960s was so bizzare.

The B-specials (who were the militarised police in Northern Ireland) intervening in the middle of a loyalist pogrom was hilarious. The reason why the army were sent to Northern Ireland in the first place was because they were refusing to go in and protect areas from these groups, often because many people in these groups were  members of the police.

The scene when they are describing themselves as Irish and talking about their history of going abroad was also bizzare. If they were Protestants in Belfast in the 60s it would be unlikely they would describe themselves as Irish and would class themselves as either British or Northern Irish. 

I think the politics side of thing is just more of a hook to get people into the movie and to make it seem like it is saying something deep or important. 

At this point I'm kind of used to it though. In media the troubles has never been portrayed particularly well, off the top of my head I can only think '71 and maybe some of the scenes in Derry Girls.",qs2ai3

Also, I'd argue that it isn't entirely apolitical. The protagonists are clearly against the protestant supremacists (or whatever you call them), and the character who acts as the conduit for the movement is defeated by the father, who acts as the antithesis of that character.
