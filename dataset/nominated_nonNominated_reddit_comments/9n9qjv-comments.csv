e7ok4yg,"Who else felt their stomach drop when Miles said the number, then felt relieved when they saw that it was because of Vietnam. Then felt really guilty for thinking Vietnam was the better of the two options?",9n9qjv
e7mvuv8,"Here’s how I understand it— 
The hotel is being bugged/run directly by Nixon’s people without FBI consent, hence the bugging and spying being at its height “around election time”.
The dude on the tape is Bobby Kennedy— Miles was clearly in Vietnam in his flashback, and thus his chronology would be real wack if it was JFK (he worked at the hotel, then got drafted, then got discharged and went back to the hotel?)
Also, he called him *senator*. While it’s possible he was still trying to conceal the identity out of respect for John, the fact that he doesn’t say President is odd.
And finally, the timeline honestly works rather nicely for it to be Bobby— he was shot in California, after all, so it isn’t a stretch to think the El Royale was one of his last stops before his death. ",9n9qjv

e7mfp2q,"I haven’t seen a lot of people mention it, but I loved the creep factor to this. It’s not horror, but it feels like a mystery directed to unnerve you. 


The scene with Jon hamm finding the mirror, the ever present never seen ‘management,’ rose and billy lee seeming to be evil murderers leading a cult. It all came together to be unnerving and amazing. 

Edit: also that opening scene choosing the rooms was amazing. ",9n9qjv
e7miifl,"I adored this film. Felt like something we don't get enough of anymore. I loved the cutting between the 'Chapters' and perspectives. Had a really great audience, very reactive. So many gasps and shouts of surprise when certain events happened. It made me feel a lot of feelings and kept me on my toes. I can't ask for much more. Hats off, I hope Goddard doesn't take such a long break between films again. ",9n9qjv
e7o7nlh,"Personally I'm surprised it's copped a bit of criticism, having heard some reviews (but not spoilers) I was expecting to be disappointed.

e7mbyc8,"I loved every song Darlene sang. When she took off her wig was really when I fell in love with her.

Great acting and I love how the movie tropes where turned up side down. ",9n9qjv
e7obr4n,Anyone else bummed when Jon Hamm died? I was really enjoying his performance. He stood out to me among an already fantastic performance all around. Really enjoyed the film,9n9qjv
e7q468j,"Favorite character  moments:  Darlene’s reacting to the series of insults in the lobby. Her silence and anger told us so much about her.  

Favorite acting moment: when he forgot his name.  Perfect blend of lost, frustrated and ..... I forget the word. Mirthless amusement.

Most puzzling choice:  Chris Hemsworths accent.

",9n9qjv
e7oxmqw,"This cinematography was amazing.

The priest with fire behind him. The orator with a halo. Nevada being sin, and those who cross that line.

I enjoyed how the characters' placements along the line (including the murderer who dies at that boundary between good and evil) were plotted.

I thought the lights-out at the roulette wheel and the continual emphases on the quarters was remarkable.

You can just see how ""God"" was letting this all play out. Like in Cabin in the Woods, ""she has to make the choice"". That was Darlene telling Miles he didn't have to kill.

The movie was incredibly self-contained except for one odd part which makes little sense to even show except in this context: DO NOT INTERFERE. Goddard made sure to focus on that for its importance to the overarching narrative in this morality tale.

The messenger was explicitly told not to interfere, and once he did he was removed. (But even that was part of the plan, so so much for free will I guess.)

That old saying, ""the devil's greatest trick was convincing others that he didn't exist"" is reflected in the bonfire scene of the orator's minions. Even his faceless appearance in Rose's introduction. All of it was of Goddard's intention.

Such an enjoyable film. Loved it. It reminds me of Pulp Fiction, the suitcase, and Jules' invincibility.",9n9qjv

e7pkmc3,"It was a collection of wonderful performances taking place in a tense box that unfortunately was ultimately empty. 

Cynthia Erivo is going to be a god damned Star and I can’t wait for it. 

But For me Lewis Pullman had the best performance of the high quality bunch. 

That scene between Darlene and Father Flynn before she bashed him in the head was really something too.  Just a masterclass.

I wish the film itself had done more to deserve all the hard work on display.

Last thing, Darlene’s absolute dismantling of Billy’s character was so beautiful and succinct (and the exact same reason I can’t stand Beat writers)",9n9qjv

e7zn6hm,"Good movie which probably needed to be 20 minutes shorter and I would have removed Chris Hemsworth from the promotional material and cut Rose's flashback to make his act 3 appearance a surprise.

e7oehr4,"So... Quentin Tarantino meets the Coen brothers meets, say, Paul Thomas Anderson (in terms of camera work, what with the extended shots, balance and tracking shots.) I have to admit, this was one of the finest films I’ve seen all year. I disagree with the criticism that it was overlong and dragged in parts. Personally, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The cult storyline was very well handled. But... who owns the hotel? It’s the Mafia, right? And it was probably JFK or Bobby on that tape? Anyway, solid 9.1/10.",9n9qjv
e7ybo8z,"Something I really loved about this film was that so much was left to the imagination or done off screen. They didn't spoon feed you everything. You didn't need detailed backgrounds on everyone, you just needed the essence of what they were about. 

For an R rated movie it was very mild in that they didn't show any sex or anything SUPER graphic, which I really appreciated. There was no obligatory sex scene (which easily could have been done given that so many people were filmed having sex there), there was no scene of the direct abuse from the father to the daughters, etc. There really wasn't any ""shock"" value which I loved bc it wasn't needed. Most of the intensity came from the plot itself. 

Honestly the only time I felt uncomfortable looking at the screen was when Billy was dancing around the room. 😂",9n9qjv
e7m7ur2,I spent the whole movie thinking that Miles was Tom Holland until I looked it up afterward and now I feel silly ,9n9qjv
e7m5dqd,"A few people on here have said that the tape is JFK and Monroe sex tape, which would explain why the FBI had Jon Hamm’s character in there, to retrieve it so the story didn’t get out... but that doesn’t explain what the deal with the hotel was, why are they spying on people and who is “management?”

Did Rose kill her father before or after she met Billy Lee? I assumed for a while that Billy Lee brainwashed her, she fell in love with him, and he convinced her to kill her father and to bring Emily along with her. However, there is that scene on the beach where Rose was wearing her father’s boots, after Billy Lee and her had just met, and it was hinted to that her father had already died. 

For people saying that Billy Lee had no motive for being there, he did, Emily had saw that Billy Lee was evil and ran away, but obviously Rose did not want to because she had fallen in love with Billy Lee which is why Emily had to “kidnap” her, and that’s how Hamm’s character got killed, trying to intervene on a suspected kidnapping despite being told not to intervene, he was only there on the FBI job. Anyway, Billy Lee said that Emily took away his property (Rose) and came to get it back. He knew where to come because Rose called him on the telephone without Emily’s knowledge. 

Billy Lee knowing that Daniel Flynn and the singer (I forget her name) we’re lying was strange, and I also don’t understand why he shot Emily instead of the kid or Daniel Flynn (just crazy maybe)

And lastly, who the F shot Nick Offerman.

And lastly lastly, why the F was Gary Gergich in this movie.",9n9qjv
e7m6hhl,Hopefully people get out to the theater to see this. I see so many people complain about how “Hollywood has no originality” or “running out of ideas” but when great original movies come out do they even go see them?,9n9qjv
e8t6n1g,"Okay, I think this movie was great, but here’s how I WISH it could have ended. 

Miles dies. Darlene and Flynn look over his dead body, as happened in the movie. But Rose wasn’t shot to death, she gets up and threatens Darlene. Flynn has a chance to save Darlene, but at the opportune moment, he forgets where he is. Darlene gets shot, Flynn, understanding he didn’t want that to happen, kills Rose for real.

Now it’s just the priest standing around a bunch of dead bodies, having no idea who he was or what had happened. 

I think that’s the dark ending I needed to elevate everything. ",9n9qjv
ecd1wws,"The lightswitch moment with Miles where he just goes off was incredibly satisfying. Also the second you find out _____ about him he immediately becomes a sympathetic character


That part was extremely well done",9n9qjv
e847zi5,"I believe the ""management"" might be the Soviets. They would have had a lot to gain at the time from having dirt on American politicians. It would explain the separate bugs in the rooms and could give an idea why the FBI was bugging rooms at the El Royale in the first place (communist witchhunts were a Hoover specialty). The duality between the two sides of the hotel could be represented as the two sides of the Cold War. In California it's a dollar more, but you're free. In Nevada, it's cheaper, but you aren't free.

Or I'm just talking out of my ass.",9n9qjv
e8kqyhb,"Wow. Based on all the mixed/underwhelmed reviews me expectations were so low and were totally blown out of the water. Gonna sound weird at first, but I think this movie is a great example of what The Hateful Eight didn’t do well. I felt part of myself rooting for each character in this movie and got genuinely nervous about most of them getting in harms way. In the hateful eight I was like ‘they’re all gonna die and why would I care?’ Bad Times is a crime film with a refreshingly complex, surprising, and original plot that does a solid job playing with noir tropes. Performances all around are great, but Jeff Bridges brings something special to the table with this one. The movie is definitely self indulgent but I think it deserves to be. It starts very convoluted and ties up very cleanly in the end, not overstaying it’s welcome. It also has something to say about America’s current political climate, as all films set in the 60s do... but entertainment and plot come first with this film. If you liked Cabin in the Woods and noir films I think you’ll enjoy this film.",9n9qjv
e7m6kkj,I went into this movie blind (seeing no previews) which made the experience so much better. Sad to see the scene of Jon Hamm discovering the two way mirrors in the trailer. That scene was one of most intense/creepy moments I've seen in awhile. ,9n9qjv
ecjp4vy,"Literally no idea why Hemsworth's character made that fuss about interrogating everyone

My biggest shock was finding out that the actor who played Emily's sister is 21, I thought she was about 14",9n9qjv
e7mgeme,"Just got out of a showing, and holy shit. Lewis Pullman needs to be in movies. I didn’t expect Miles to be my favorite character by the end of the movie, but, by when it was all said and done, Pullman acted the hell out of that role. ",9n9qjv
e7oaf6p,This isn’t gonna do well at the box office is it? Very unfortunate cause it’s a very well done film with great performances all around.,9n9qjv
e7m5ncj,"The first third or so was so, so good. From there it never quite recaptured the amazing atmosphere of the scene where Jon Hamm finds the two way mirrors. I still enjoyed it a lot, but overall I thought it was a fun movie that wasted a lot of its potential. The whole Billy Lee thing in the third act exemplified that. All the ingredients were there for something amazing, but it just didn’t quite come together right. Cynthia Erivo was the highlight for me, and I can’t believe her singing isn’t on either soundtrack.

This is a really, really minor quibble, but I wish they hadn’t kept coming back to the JFK film reel. Rose looking at it and saying ‘I know him, didn’t he die’ was enough of a hint, every reference after that felt like the writers had zero faith in the audience.",9n9qjv
e7x0b1q,"I was expecting Miles to be Norman Bates, but instead he was Rambo.",9n9qjv
e7sla4k,"I don't know why I assumed this, but from the beginning of the movie to the credits, I kept waiting for the state lines to be somehow important to the plot. When Miles brings up they only have a liquor license in one state, I assumed that that was a foreshadowing to some kind of legal catch in the final act involving the money. Something like ""In the state of Nevada it's legal to keep money you find underneath a building, but not California."" Okay, obviously not THAT ridiculous, but, you hopefully understand what I mean. When shit went down and everything ended I was basically sitting in my seat like ""Well that movie was fun but why the gimmick of making the hotel in two states? Just novelty?""

I enjoyed the film, seemingly more than other Redditors here, but I do agree I felt like there was a plot hole or two. The movie was already long, yet I felt like it needed an extra 15 minutes to expand on things like Hamm's character, the FBI investigation, etc.

Glad they didn't reveal who was on the tape though. Seeing everyone here discuss it is more fun than knowing for sure.",9n9qjv
e89zr6x,"I'm on the fence with this film to be honest. The pacing was a little weird. The story introduced so many things that ended up not mattering. The screenplay I thought was just ok. 

Then there were moments of greatness. The beginning lobby scene getting rooms, the tracking shot of Hamm finding all the two way mirrors, and The Priest getting the money while Darlene sings and Em watches through the mirror were all amazing scenes on their own. For some reason it just didnt click with me overall.",9n9qjv
e8c6kvy,"Wow! This movie impressed me. The cast was great! Jon Hamm and Jeff Bridges were as good as they usually are. I expected Hamm to have a larger part, but I think that might have been an intentional subversion. You expect a guy like him to be the protagonist, not get blown away early. You know?

Hemsworth was great. His Thor charm and humor showed through when needed and he really had the perfect sinister vibe.

I don't really remember seeing Cynthia Erivo or Lewis Pullman in anything before, but they were both impressive too.

The singing scenes and other musical bits really felt like they fit, even though sometimes that stuff can feel like it's just thrown in.

This movie consistently got me with the twists and surprises, too. The various sudden gunshots made me jump. Billy Lee's arrival and Miles' reveal were both great. 

I went in just expecting something fun, but I think this might be one of my favorites I've seen lately.",9n9qjv
e7m2skp,Hemsworth’s dance to Hush was goddamn hypnotic ,9n9qjv
e7m32cw,"Just got out of this film... Generally enjoyed it and appreciated it's direction and the cast was all fantastic, but I just felt it was missing something? I never really felt the movie had a consistent tone, I couldn't tell if it was going for funny or dark and serious. (The Chris Hemsworth fight scene for example.) It also felt very Tarantino-esque but just lacking something special. A good watch but definitely not as special or unique as Cabin in the woods. But interested to see what Drew Goddard does next. 
P.S. Miles became such a wholesome character at the end and I appreciated it. ",9n9qjv
ec9e8fv,"A couple of things that seemed strange to me:

1. Emily is trying to save her sister and turned into a killer so quickly. 0-100 real fast there. I guess she brought the guns to potentially fight off the cult, but she must have known Hamm wasn’t in the cult as he arrived at the hotel before she did. 

2. The Darlene bottle smash scene was weird watching from Darlene’s perspective. She takes off her high heels and runs over to the priest extremely fast. So fast I don’t even think she would have really had time to see and much less process what was happening before she darts towards him. ",9n9qjv

ecidiqj,The small 3 vertical windows on the right side of the wall in the opening scene was a really nice touch. You could immediately see that the priest was in the wrong room looking for what was in Darlene's room when Laramie was spying on all the rooms.,9n9qjv
e7n49at,"I was really intrigued by the premise and the first 2/3 of the movie was very suspenseful ... but for me it fizzled in the end.  They built up a lot of mystery that had little to no payoff.  

IMO there were 3 things they did wrong:

1. They killed off Jon Hamm way too soon.  They could have done a lot more with his character.

2.  I just did not like the dynamic of the film after Hemsworth's cult took everybody captive.  It took away the mystery of the film just to set up a quick action sequence to kill almost everyone off and resolve things.  I think the movie would have been better off if Hemsworth's character showed up to stalk/hunt Emily & Rose while all the other stuff is going on.

3.  There should have been more of a payoff or some sort of twist from at least one of the management, FBI, or tape plotlines.  ",9n9qjv
e7nzq41,"Father Flynn's real name was in there for sure during his sentencing. When it came time for him to try and recall it for Billy Lee, I was right there with him knowing full well somewhere in by brain I knew what it was, but still completely unable to spit the damn thing out. That was the coolest little detail to me.",9n9qjv
e84qcju,"Overall I liked the movie. It felt like it was missing some info and the story might be better as a mini series. 

I really love Darlene. She was a hard working woman just trying to get to a job and got looped into everything. She stood up for herself and tried to protect everyone else. She was tough when she needed to be but also very kind (like when she told Miles that he didn’t need to kill anymore). I wanted to clap when she verbally undressed Billy Lee. Darlene is a hero.",9n9qjv
e7sf9t6,"I really liked this movie, it felt like it was made for me.  It's weird and dark in all the right places, and I can overlook its flaws because of its strengths.

What I liked: To start with, this is probably my favorite Chris Hemsworth performance. Cynthia Erivo is new to me and she was great, as is Lewis Pullman. When his character had the Vietnam flashback at the end I was literally watching mouth agape. I've always really liked Drew Goddard's stuff, and this was no exception. I'm a sucker for ""colorful cast of characters in an isolated location"" so this movie was practically made for me.

What I didn't like: This came as a huge surprise to me, I wasn't really into Jeff Bridges' performance. I thought the emotional beats worked, like him forgetting his real name at the end, but something was off about the performance and I can't quite articulate why. I wish Jon Hamm's character had lived longer, I really thought the movie dragged to a halt in the time between his death and Hemsworth's arrival.

Overall I thought this was great, but it's a little too specific for me to recommend it universally.  In that respect it reminded me a bit of *A Cure for Wellness* which was also weird in ways I really liked (though very different from this movie.  I give it 4/5, I saw a few movies yesterday and this was my favorite.",9n9qjv
e82a6zf,"Saw this today. It was really something special. Great cast, interesting writing and direction, and a positive theme about the difference between compassion and trying to rescue others.

The opening shot was a gesture that this was going to be something different. The long, static shot resembled theatre more than film. It was a technique that Drew Goddard re-used throughout: long shots which followed characters performing simple yet revealing activities. The absence of dialogue in some of these shots created tension and focussed attention on the action.

The dialogue, when it came in, also resembled theatre more than film. When dialogue began, between Flynn and Darlene, it was not only charming, as in an old screwball comedy, but also laden with subtext: the characters' intent to charm each other. Very different from standard Hollywood dialogue which tends towards the perfunctory.

The theatrical dialogue continued inside the El Royale with Sullivan and Miles's long speeches which provided not only exposition but also characterisation. I think it might be the long speeches which provoke reviewers into comparing this movie to Tarantino. I think that's a mistake. Tarantino's speeches tend to merely entertain. These speeches performed multiple dramatic functions simultaneously.

Emily's dialogue, when she arrived, performed the same functions by being the exact opposite: terse and offensive.

I won't go into the switchbacks of plotting other than to note its complexity, the layers of reversals resembling theatre more than film.

Given the grinding nature of those reversals, I was very pleased to see a positive theme emerge at the end. Every character who tries to rescue someone else comes off worse for the attempt. (Edit: Even Billy Lee, in his own way, tries to rescue others -- from ""the game."") The two who find the best outcomes are the two who don't try to rescue anyone, and who, when faced with a situation they are unable to rescue someone from, opt merely to be compassionate. Trying to rescue others just generates more drama; compassion ends it.

Following that we have the standard horror trope of the house of evil purged by fire, and the satisfying symmetry of the first two characters we saw enter being the last two to leave. The final scene shows them free, having given up on presenting a false self.

A lot of thought and skill went into this movie, and as a result, it seems more arthouse than Hollywood. I can understand perfectly why it's gone over so many heads.",9n9qjv
e8es732,"When hamm gets shot with the shotgun, I jumped and was immersed in it. This movie is such a gem.

He's supposed to be some super senior high up FBI agent with a direct line to J Edgar Hoover but his opsec was horrific, he opens the key box without closing it, opens the maintenance room without closing it, goes into the basement without closing the door and tramps around the surveillance hallway and turns on the intercom of Darlene singing loudly while wandering around the area with her singing on full blast for anyone in the hotel to hear, and then when he tries to apprehend Dakota Johnson he doesn't even bother to make sure the criminal woman who's kidnapped a little girl is at least secured in some way and in like arm's reach of a giant shotgun...come on",9n9qjv

It's entirely possible that I enjoyed this so much since the last movie I saw was the new Predator (which was horrible). But I'd give it a 7/10. Some plot holes definitely and the pacing was a little slow at times but I left feeling satisfied and I liked most of the characters.",9n9qjv

Like it was being used an excuse to complete Darlene's character arc and flesh out her evolution from a timid pushover to a confident artiste. Add to that Billy's shellshocked reaction to a generic observation that sounded like 'you're a bully cuz your willy small' made it even more unbelievable. Chris Hemsworth's character could have been so much more. An agnost fanatic with a disdain for everything material and an ideology (though misguided) that countered any arguments thrown at him, making his eventual demise a lot more cathartic because a great evil would then have been quenched.

A few questions, as I went to the bathroom around the middle and must have missed some important exposition:

* Do we know who kills Ron Swanson in the first scene? Is it the third guy involved in the heist? Was he ever referenced to again?

* It doesn't seem like Miles let anyone know about the existence of his film canister until the ""priest"" showed up; how did Don Draper know it was there? 

* I got that everyone arrived in costume - ""priest"", ""vacuum salesman"", ""hippie"", ""straight hair"" - so was Miles in costume as the porter, hiding who he really was (a killer) or was that just who he was meant to be and thus the only honest one there?

* I'm assuming the theme here was choice- California or Nevada, paradise or hope, confess or lie, help or let someone die, believe someone or not, sleep your way to stardom or grind out Reno gigs, red or black, etc. - but did Rosie face any choices? Or was she just chaos? I kinda didn't get her angle, aside from maybe being nuts.

* Was anyone else waiting for a supernatural element in the third act? I was thinking with Goddard writing/directing we would see that the hotel was purgatory, or the priest forgot that he was actually God, or Miles was Charon, or something. Instead Thor was just a manipulative dick.

Overall I liked the movie; great tension, cast, some funny moments and the bottle smash scene really caught me by surprise. I think it petered out at the end, seems like it might have been re-written as it didn't flow with the first two thirds. 

Also, saw it last night at an Alamo Drafthouse and each person got a random keychain, either California or Nevada; thought that was pretty neat. ",9n9qjv

I thought the Vietnam war flash back was way cool. 

How they introduced each character was awesome.

The FBI agent and the camera film are linked.

Why else would the room be bugged? The film never elaborates on that either, so you could say it was for just about anything.

I liked it.  I agree with most redditors that it had some plot holes.  However, I think we are hand fed ideas.  I like unique movies that are somewhat open to interpretation.  I think we live in an era of film, where everything hast to be on a silver platter.  Who was the third robber and where did he go?  Who was management?  Was it the FBI/CIA or another entity.  To me the answer to these questions dont bother me.

&#x200B;

It was just nice to get a little breath of fresh air.  To find a concept that hasn't been beaten to death.  That Cynthia Erivo stole the show and was great.  Jeff Bridges was fantastic.  Even Dakota Johnson was alright.  Chris Hemsworth did his job in making us creeped out and hypnotized.  Miles actor was great as well. ",9n9qjv

e7qipo2,"I feel like everyone saying the ending sucked and therefore the movie wasn't that good is just copying what other people are saying because it didn't go the way they wanted. They completely ignore so many of the wonderful aspects of this movie, like the use of music, acting and character development, color palate, effective tension building (yes, it was effective, you just might not have gotten the payoff you wanted), and the levels of different stories interacting with each other. I think people are just mad because this movie wasn't made by Tarantino and didn't have CRAZY CONSPIRACY SHIT like in Cabin in the Woods. Go watch it again, from a technical standpoint, and then come back if you really didn't think it was great the first time. Look for stuff like staging, for shot composition. For example, think back to when Bridges' character lights the fire before he sits down with Darlene to eat a slice of pie. After they sit down, it shows the flames flickering behind his back hinting at his possible sinister intentions. It plays to seem like he's been laying a trap, which he is to some extent, but it's not truly as sinister as we are led to believe; He just wants his money. He didn't follow her to the El Royale, he didnt even plan on getting involved with her until he knew that the money was in her room. 

&nbsp;

This is a recurring theme throughout the movie, where we're set up to think that every character has some secret, sinister plan, but in reality it's just a bunch of people who got caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people (much like most people who get caught up in cults). Even the cult is just a group of people being led by a charismatic narcissistic sociopath who believe they've found the truth in life and just want to live their lives by their own rules. Billy Lee is the only true ""evil"" character in the story, and as far as we're shown (until the climax) he's only blatantly malevolent because he had what ""was his"" stolen from him and he wants her back. He was fucked up, no doubt, and abused his followers for sure, but he only becomes evil once he reaches the El Royale. He stumbled upon what people like Charles Manson would consider a gold mine of opportunity. He has all of the power over these people now, and has the chance to essentially play God (this mindset is very similar to that of Chigurh in No Country For Old Men, another sociopath). He didn't plan for it, but his sociopathic nature led him to a situation that is absolutely  possible and horrifying, a situation that most people don't fear until it affects them personally: being at the mercy of someone who thirsts for power and is not tied to society's definitions of ""good"" and ""evil"". In his mind, these people deserve what he is doing to him, they are liars, thieves, and hypocrites and he is a being of truth and wisdom and thus is worthy of being a judge of life and death. We know these people dont deserve what he is doing to them, which is ironic because many of us were so sure that at least one of them had sinister intentions. That is fucking scary, way scarier that ghosts or demons because we know for a fact that people like Billy Lee exist in this reality. It's verifiable fact. ",9n9qjv

I felt like that was the climax of the movie, and then Hamm is immediately killed and that whole part of the story is forgotten. Like, I just kept hoping that a different FBI agent would show up to pick up the investigation but it never happened. 

Also, the beginning scene when Nick Offerman buries the money, should’ve been seen by someone, right? I mean, our vantage point for that scene was front of the other side of the mirror, so it seems reasonable that whoever worked at the hotel witnessed him tearing up the floorboards and burying a suspicious suitcase underground, and they just left it, and did nothing about it?

ecl3cte,"People are asking valid questions about how Darlene knew Flynn was dodgy, and her answer stating that being shook for years making you spot a shaker. Spot on. If that doesn't make you super-suspicious and hyper-aware...

This is followed by why Billy cared for the source of the loot. Easy. To anticipate the calibre of the incoming onslot. Some money might just not be worth the hassle of living for years as a target and sleeping with one eye open, out in the open.

My standout fact is that the Black person not only does not die first; hello ""LL COOL J"", but remains one of the only two survivors in a Hollywood movie. Superb acting from Cynthia ""Darlene"" and Jeff ""Flynn"" all the way through. Some of their non-verbal communication scenes were the most priceless. Someone aptly described Jeff's breathing scenes as a monologue.

Dakota's continuing and stilted acting with the emotionless facial expression, induces a level of cringe I haven't felt in years. At least Chris's equally cringe worthy, off beat, wavey belly dance made me guffaw. The fact that I wanted to clobber ""Rose"" meant that Cailee also delivered. John's ""Seymour"" and Lewis's ""Miles"" scenes defined Chris ""Billy's"" allegory more than he could ever verbalise. All in all, loved this a lot more than I thought I would.",9n9qjv
e7nhfw2,"While the movie isn't perfect, I thought it was very enjoyable and definitely something Tarantino fans would enjoy. 

I see a lot of people mentioning the third act and how the ending feels flat. But I think the main story of the movie revolves around Father Flynn considering the opening scene is part of his story arc. We get a lot of great characters along the way but Seymour Sullivan (Jon Hamm) isn't our main character and his story arc is probably more of an entertaining decoy to keep us guessing about what is happening.

The ending I think emphasizes that Darlene Sweets just wants to sing. She just came up on a whole bunch of money, enough to change her life and she just continues to sing. Father Flynn probably has a few weeks left to live at most with his health condition so there really isn't anymore closure we can have regarding those two.

As far as the hotel and it's mysteries I think them tossing the film just emphasizes they really don't care about any of that stuff and I enjoy that it is left to mystery.

e7mka9n,"I was in love with the film for maybe the first half or so, but that turned into waiting for payoffs that never really came. Not a bad time (heh) by any means, but I left the theater feeling like I had just witnessed a lot of wasted potential.

[The film's willingness to kill characters very suddenly and without warning was gutsy, but it ended up stripping so many elements out of the narrative that it became extremely unsatisfying. Like the FBI stuff was intriguing, and it's completely gone after ~45 minutes. There's no real emotional climax between the sisters either. I'm okay with it going dark, but that was a lot of build-up for ""little sister seems to decide she doesn't care (but we don't really know for sure because all she does after is try to kill somebody who murdered her lover)."" There was probably ways to circle back to some of this stuff even with the deaths, like another character seriously confronting the little sister, but we don't get that.](#spoiler)

I might be in the minority on this, but Hemsworth felt like some bad miscasting to me. I wonder how much better the second half would have worked if they had gotten some actor who can manage more than being funny and looking handsome. Not to begrudge him for either quality -- those are great! -- but some roles require something more. This was one of them.

After the movie started and all the characters had been introduced I thought the set up was going to be that each character had learned about the buried money through different circumstances and each character was there to take the moeny for themselves. After the hidden hallway scene with Jon Hamm it became clear that was not the set up or plot of the movie at all.

I thought, ""okay that's fine. Where is this going?"" and then it didn't go anywhere. Just 4 seperate stories converging into one bad night at one location. There didn't really seem to be any point to what or why any of it was happening. Just things happening and all the interesting qualities led to nothing. Even the most obvious comparison to the Hatful 8, and by extension John Carpenters The Thing, I thought okay maybe this film is about paranoia. But it doesn't even go that far. Sure its there and every character exhibits some degree of paranoia but I wouldn't go as far to say the movie was about that. 

Disappointed over all by the lack of point but the movie is not terrible. Great technical qualities, production design, costume design, excellent cinematography and of course a great cast that each deliver solid performances. Even the script despite the lack of point is wonderfully structured. It just doesn't amount to very much. ",9n9qjv
e83o0z9,"Fucking loved it.  Cast was fantastic, especially Erivo and Bridges.  There were some stellar shots and sequences (when Hamm's character first discovers the hidden windows, with Erivo's vocals in the background, that was truly spectacular).  Loved the usage of character's reflections in the mirrors, both their own and when somebody was looking through to the other side, that was extremely effective.  Visually stunning use of sets and colors and costumes.  The end didn't drag as much for me as it did for others.  I definitely get the Tarantino influence but that's what I felt it was...an influence rather than copying...Goddard used flashbacks and dialogue heavily just like QT but made it his own, and I thought both the dialogues and flashbacks had a lot more heart than Tarantino's which are usually solely for exposition and stylistic choices (and I say that with no disrespect, I am a big fan of Tarantino's work), and his command of some of the more adventurous sequences shows that he has vision of his own.  It's definitely a film for a niche audience though, wouldn't recommend it to just anybody but my wife and I fucking loved it.  Cynthia's vocals were just the cherry on top of the cake, phenomenal voice both technically and emotionally.

eazeweo,"I have to say: 
Was the writer inspired by the novel, *The Girls* by Emma Cline? It's a loose retelling of the Charles Manson cult, narrated by an old woman looking back at the year of 1969. It follows the true events very closely, but the main character seemed more infatuated with a young woman in the cult than its leader. She also (bizarrely) doesn't seem to mind having all these older men giving her inappropriate attention. Yes, I know that the Manson Family has been a popular subject for many years, but this is only the second re-imagining I've seen of it [**Edit:** Scratch that-- there was also Lana del Rey's music video for ""Freak""]. Rose also looked like how I imagined Evie Boyd.

I'm still on season 6 of *Mad Men*, but I had this smile on my face upon seeing Jon Hamm in another period piece! C:

e7nbh5y,"This film felt like a cross between Tarantino's Hateful Eight and a whodunit like Murder on the Orient Express. I really enjoyed Goddard's style with the character perspectives and background stories, and I was ready for an epic climax where the characters are all somehow connected and are at the El Royale for a common purpose. The cinematography was truly gripping as we saw each character's perspective- the scene where Jon Hamm discovered the two-way mirror with Darlene singing while Father Flynn was breaking into the floorboards was my favorite scene by far. Then Darlene smashing the bottle over Flynn's head and then witnessing the shooting of John Hamm from the alt angle. Anything could have happened at that point.

However, after John Hamm's character is shot and Darlene and Father Flynn make their pact, the rest really fell flat for me. Billy Lee's cult was just weird, and Emily and Rose's characters lacked any real depth other than serving as a trope for Lee's ""nothing is all good or evil"". And while I really, really like his character (the intro to the El Royale had me cracking up) the reveals with Miles at the end seemed like a cheap way to end the film as we have an unexpected hero. Perhaps some of this could have been introduced earlier. Overall I was left wanting much more. ",9n9qjv

It makes the most sense to me that the man on the tape is MLK, as he died the previous year (68), and the FBI agent sent by Hoover had the explicit goal of retrieving the surveillance. Hoover infamously had the FBI wiretapping MLK and gathering evidence of his various affairs up until his demise. The ""management"" in the film was the FBI itself, likely Hoover's office, surreptitiously gaining leverage on key political figures, John Hamm's character just not being in the loop as Hoover did many operations off the reservation.

Anyways, I really thought that the movie was great, though I really think that the introduction of Miles’ backstory could’ve been done a little better. Maybe instead of cutting away during a tense and important current situation scene, have it done earlier, before he finds the knocked out (fake) priest and asks him for a confession? I mean they could’ve shown him in his room, getting high, and then flashing back to show his backstory. They could’ve also taken this time to flesh things out a little more and make us understand his background better, by actually showing us him being discarded from society after all the horrors of war he’s witnessed, and then being offered a job at the El Royale (and thus being accepted only by the people at “management” after everyone else has rejected him), and show how he gets addicted to drugs as he sees how high society plays out during his time there, and this continues even as the hotel slowly becomes less and less fabulous and the people stop coming. Even the staff start leaving, but Miles could never leave the only place that accepted him after the Vietnam war. The El Royale was there for him when nobody was, and now nobody will be there for him anymore when they find out he’s reliant on hard drugs to cope with day to day life. So he stays, haunted by the things he’s seen in war and in the El Royale, unable to leave. And then as the days pass and no one comes, one day while getting high, there is a loud banging as Darlene calls for someone to man the counter. And that’s when they should’ve cut back to Miles finding the priest.

&#x200B;

Timeline doesn't really make sense but reasons I thought it was going to be Miles.

&#x200B;

1. Miles thought he knew the priest from somewhere in the beginning of the film. But Bridges said ""no"", maybe they didn't know each other by face during the robbery maybe just had masks and Jeff knew Nick because he was the brother.
2. When Nick gets killed, right at the beginning of the movie, it may have been filmed. Miles works at the El Royale because management has dirt on him. Why wouldn't he just leave that shitty job right? Maybe he was the third robber and they have evidence of him killing Nick and are forcing him to work there?  He doesn't know where the money is because he didn't know the contingency plan?
3. Maybe management didn't have dirt on him, but he works there in hopes to discover the lost money.
4. I thought ""the Kid"" in the mask looked a lot like Miles.

Number 2. messes up the timeline of the movie, because Miles was in Vietnam which means he would have first killed Nick then gone to Vietnam. If management had dirt on him they would've employed him from the start (or maybe he was drafted and forced to go).

Quite Tarantino vibey, but a bit heavy on the Manson-factor. Also I really liked the production values behind setting the film in the 1969, but then they bring out shirtless Thor-guy with the body of action man. As someone mentioned weird that replacement Anton Yelchin didn't have a reaction to standing in the direct line of fire from a shotgun 3 metres away, considering he was talking about his sins from the beginning so he def wasn't not in that headspace. Cool moment when he switched to Mark Wahlberg, but a bit too much of a Hollywood approach in my mind, somehow too slick. Another little detail that bothered me was after the older sister shot the FBI dude she said 'wtf' as she discovered the 2way mirror, in the other timeline she says 'jesus christ'.

 I was kind of disappointed that the set up of the hotel was really just a perv hotel. I was hoping that the hotel was a part of a much larger and sinister force and the FBI had sent Jon Hamm's character to investigate. When Miles said he's killed many people I was hoping that it was somehow tied to the hotel and the managers were a part of some drug/sex slave traffic behind closed doors, and the while the ending reveal of Miles was interesting I felt like it was a tad bit random. 

I was also hoping that the killer (during the money hiding scene) early on the in the movie was tied to the hotel somehow. I might have missed this but they didn't really touch up on that . 

I also wished that they would have spent more time on Chris Hemsworth's character and developing his back story or at least his interactions with Rose.

I can understand some may not like that this is Tarantino-lite, but I really like that about this. The story is done in the styles Tarantino would do but not nearly as graphic. I think that's what makes this so well done. It takes those unique ideas but keeps it grounded to not be overdone.

I don't really understand why they are all present at the same time and I don't understand why there are no other guests or staff at the hotel. It all felt so implausible. It went from a hotel where A-list celebrities partied with senior politicians to nothing in a year?! How does that make sense? Or did i just miss something? It was asking to much of me to leave my brain at the door like that. 

It had a few other issues of implausibility which broke the fourth wall for me, some of the dialogue scenes dragged a little and so did the scenes where she sang. 

Having said that, i enjoyed bits and pieces. You feel quite surprised at what's happening and the layers unravel and you begin to see an arc, like why is our pallid but still fresh faced hotel clerk shooting up heroin in his grimy back room? Well you get quite a convincing answer to that and it feels nourishing to have a story adequately settled in the end. Furthermore, I felt the acting from Bridges, the Singer and the Clerk was stellar.

e86dehc,"A theory here...

I believe that Rosie was the adopted daughter of the couple she killed.

- Rosie was clearly emotionally disassociated.

- There were comments on the news broadcast about how the couple murdered were known for their help of Polish Children.

- It was somewhat common for children adopted from Eastern European countries to have severe emotional issues due to neglect in orphanages.

- It was clear the children were being abused in their own home by the father.

- Billy Lee made comments about her being psychologically cold, but Emily had made comments ""yes, but never violent"".

- It would give some kind of reason as to why their murder was included at all. If there was no reason for the murders, there was no reason for it to be in the movie at all.

I'd really appreciate anyone who could advise why this is not the case, because I haven't read this theory anywhere else.

Good flick, but it felt like Tarantino Lite. The filmography was every bit as good, but I felt like the dialogue lacked the intensity.

I really expected the Nevada/California border to somehow play a huge role in the movie... and apart from causing some sweet discussion between Father Floyd and Darlene, it was virtually non existant. There might be a huge cultural shift between Nevada and California that I might not be aware of due to not being American.

There were some absolutely stunning sequences, my favourite being the singing/pulling up floorboards sequence. It was the only scene in the movie where I thought that Darlene might actually be in trouble",9n9qjv

e7m9r0l,"Mixed on this one. There’s a lot of really interesting “stuff” scattered all throughout but it feels more like pieces of a TV miniseries squeezed together rather than a coherent film played out. In fact, the concept would’ve worked so much better as a series because each room felt like it’s own anthology until they all combine. Instead the way they cut between each other feels really awkward and increases the length of the movie. This could’ve and should’ve been 45 minutes shorter. That’s a lot to cut but there’s so much where either very little is happening to push the plot forward or things we already know about are being covered again, which again, is something that could be done more efficiently with TV but not for a feature. It’s very well acted and extraordinarily well shot, so it’s not an issue of competence on the filmmakers parts. Maybe an edited version of this would be much more enjoyable to watch where the pacing is more streamlined. I give it a 6/10, which is higher than it would be if not for how good-looking of a movie this is. Cinematography is a 9/10, and the soundtrack is a solid 10.",9n9qjv

Apparently [that scene was her idea and she sat down with the director to write it as well](https://twitter.com/CynthiaEriVo/status/1050557649501212673). I really enjoyed Jon Hamm's (short-lived) role, and Lewis Pullman did a great job from the awkward bellboy to aimbot mercenary.

The worst parts were probably:

* Chris Hemsworth channelling his inner yeehaw and doing a terrible job of it.
* Perhaps it was just me and this is just a minor quibble overall but it was really hard to follow what was going on in the news reports in the lobby. I managed to piece it together in the end though.
* I feel that Emily's abuse could have been handled a bit more overtly. For a film that would hint at bestiality and cults, I found it strange that it would tip-toe around the abuse that happened in her childhood.

e7yo8s8,"*Bad Times at the El Royale* is an excellent exercise in style and genre, but not an absolute must-see like Goddard's previous movie Cabin in the Woods. The film has some pacing issues, especially in the first half.  Some character backstories (like Darlene's) I didn't particularly need to see and slowed the movie down.  While there are no genre busting revelations in the second half like with Cabin, there are plot turns and fun character twists in the third act I did not see coming.  I kept steeling myself for something reaaly horrific or brutal to occur near the end, but was almost disappointed when a moment like that that never came.  Chris Hemsworth is 100% believable as a cult leader surrounded by ravenous young groupies, but he isn't as frightening a presence as I hoped he would be, which is only a minor quibble.  The performances were uniformly excellent. 
 The fact that Jeff Bridges is great could almost go without saying.  But I was pleasantly surprised by Cynthia Erivo and Lewis Pullman, two actors I hadn't seen before, who basically steal the whole damn  movie out from under their better known costars.   Two of the films strongest, most standout sequences are structured around Cynthia Erivo's incredible isolated singing voice.

I liked how much it let the characters relate and empathize with each other (""Flynn"" and Darlene, Miles just wanting empathy and forgiveness for what he's done, ""Laramie"" trying to save Rose when he was being told not to which got him killed, and so on). I found what Darlene (and the movie) said about being numb to powerful men who are just weak-willed people who just talk and talk and talk and say nothing, just trying to cover up their own shit. The reflections going on through the one-way mirrors and other normal mirrors was also really interesting, either they're a ghost in the room or they see someone they don't really recognize.

There was clearly a lot of love and care put into this and I really had a great time with it. Also Chris Hemsworth was extremely charismatic and scummy, and it was a weird line to see him ride.",9n9qjv
e7p3ncy,"I liked the movie a lot, its premise was very similar to *The Hateful Eight* in terms of seven/eight strangers with connections they might not know about being trapped in a strange environment-murder ensues.  I really liked however played Darlene as she showed a nice mix of strength but also vulnerability, and her ""MeToo"" story was very timely.  The priest and Miles were awesome and I liked Dakota Johnson's southern drawl and matter-of-factness about whatever situation she found herself in and of course, I'm still waiting for the day when Jon Hamm gets a movie to really shine in because whatever he's been in recently, *A Young Doctor's Notebook*, *Baby Driver*, and now *Bad Times*, he leaves me wanting more.

That said, I feel like I would've enjoyed this movie more if nothing changed but it was directed and written by Quentin Tarantino.  Imo, this movie borrowed heavily from Tarantino's style and morality themes, but it felt like a certain tension or style was lacking in a lot of scenes.  Such as when the cult leader Billy Dee is dancing to the music in the finale, that was a great scene, but I felt like it missed a certain punch that wouldn't have been missed in other movies.  Also when Dakota Johnson was questioning Miles in the El Royale's foyer.  He's tied up and being questioned about what the hotel actually is with the threat in the air that they're going to kill him unless he convinces them otherwise.  But imo, there's no menace there.

e7vamwc,"Drew Goddard is heavily channeling his inner Tarantino with this over-written crime thriller. It’s a film filled with many long dialogues (and lots and lots of singing) that often sound too lavish and verbose for their own good, or conversations often repeat what was already said before. In this sense, Bad Times at the El Royale is basically The Hateful Eight, just in a 1960s hotel. The pace of the movie is very slow, which works when there’s tension or character building, but again, it’s too slow for its own good as many scenes go on for too long or they are simply dull. What would have been a simple but effective crime flick about multiple people going after a bag of money is bogged down by subplots that end when their characters suddenly die. The third act arrival of a murderous cult leader who has a Natural Born Killers relationship with one of the characters changes the tone and plot into one long talkative confrontation. It’s all well acted and nicely shot, but also very over-cooked, indulgent, and uneven.",9n9qjv

None of the plot about the the two way mirrors or  Bridges not being a priest were ruined although even if it they had, it’s revealed pretty early and it’s also quite easy to assume he wasn’t a priest. 

The whole time I was engaged and just kept thinking please deliver one hell of an ending to put this over the top. Probably for that reason, it felt (only a little) flat to me and left the theater thinking this movie is a very very solid 9/10. Very solid. ",9n9qjv

I was struck by something as my friend and I were discussing the movie after leaving the theatre.  There is a William Faulkner short story called [""A Rose for Emily""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rose_for_Emily) about a reclusive Southern belle in a small Mississippi town.  The sisters' names were Rose and Emily in the movie and they were (presumably) from Alabama.  Could the sisters' names be an allusion to this story?  In reviewing the plot of the story, it would be pretty difficult to find direct linkages with the movie.

The director made sure everything stayed in place by filming it almost all chronology which is not often done. Because the film mostly took place in the lobby.

ef5xmuk,"I really enjoyed the movie, what a ride.   
People say it goes in every direction (like a JFK orgasm ?) but at the end, the money remains the low key corner stone of the story. I like the fact that it becomes the downfall of the cult : Billie's character wants to play it holy and above the system but his greed betrays that idea and eventually his whole buisness.   


Speaking of Billie, BAD casting. I usually love the Hemsworth but that was a bad call. Chris performance felt very heavy lifted and I had a really hard time buying him as this loved entity. Everything felt off, from the acting, to the dancing, to that weird super clean white shirt he wears in the forest. I was very glad when Jeff Bridges had enough of the bad acting and started to smash Chris' face with a burning torch. I'm glad they managed to keep that incident in the film and rewrote the ending.   
The thing is, Chris is very beautiful and sexy but he doesn't have Charm. I'm talking about that inherent, persuasive mojo that most cult leader thrive on. I'm still thinking about it but I'm sure there was someone more interesting to cast for that particular role/reveal.  


I just wanted to give a last shoutout to a few of the movie's qualities. The design a lovely and the screenplay's structure is a delight. It felt like a more grounded Tarantino, where the chaos of the story feels exciting.   
The movie has probably my favorite scene of 2018 : the clapping & singing while they dig up the money. It took me a while to get the danger of the moment and as soon as I did, I was a slave to the tension.

e7mhh36,"Aside from the fact that this was really absorbing from the start, we got yet another exceptional performance from Jeff Bridges. Even though we knew Father Flynn wasn't completely honest early on, him revealing his deteriorating memory felt very vulnerable and honest. Lewis Pullman as Miles was also a pleasant surprise & deserves alot of praise, especially during the final moments of the 'maintenance closet' act.  His acting style and appearance reminded me of a young Anton Yelchin and really sold it as the veteran in pain over the lives he took but seeing how much he really wanted to better himself in his final moments was heart wrenching.

Drew Goddard's storytelling was also very reminiscent of Tarantino's style(namely 'The Hateful Eight' & 'Reservoir Dogs'), the way we keep flashing back to get more insight into these characters & their past and eventually intertwine with their current predicament/situation. I really enjoyed it and felt it worked as a strength.


Interesting to read that Tom Holland(no doubt the original choice for Miles)and Russell Crowe were also up for roles in this film but things worked out with what we got.

Who was management? (Pro blackmailers I assume?)

What was the initial spy mission if they had no idea of the other monitoring that was going on? Why did they never send any sort of back up after not hearing from the agent?

Who was on “The Tape?” (Given context clues my guess is they were probably eluding to JFK)

How did Miles get the job in the first place? Was he being forced to stay there since he knew so much?",9n9qjv
e7mvery,"Performances were great. Personally I felt it moved pretty fast. Like I know it was 2 hours long but it doesn’t hold your hand and over explain everything. Most of the backstory comes through quick shots or lines. 

My favorite sub plot is one I’ve seen a lot of people complain about. The little girl and her sister.

When Emily says (and I can’t remember the exact wording) “there wasn’t violence before you” to Billy Lee and he walks up and says “maybe there was, maybe there wasn’t” at first I thought it was just more hippie non sense but he’s right the first time. There was violence before him. 

She was in an abusive home. Emily tried to protect her even when they were kids. Maybe she did protect her, maybe she didn’t. We never see. Just that she tried. Just like Emily is once again trying now. Which makes her getting shot, while her sister just stands by indifferent, so incredibly sad. 

Yes, Emily killed an innocent man, who was trying to help. And yes, she was probably going to kill more people to save her sister. So she’s “evil” in that sense. But her motivations are not sinister. They’re pure.

I never really felt sure that I knew what was going to happen and none of the characters ever felt safe.

I do have to say, on that note, that I was a bit disappointed with the ending. When Darlene said something to Father Flynn about coming to Reno to hear her sing, I thought ""Well that's how this movie is going to end"", and then as it continued to surprise me I figured I was wrong, but then that's exactly the ending we got.

e7t6jq2,"My wife and I saw it this weekend and we both loved it. We both agreed that the first third of the movie was far and away the best part of the movie, and the movie loses a bit of its reach once Chris Hemsworth is introduced. 

I think the scene where Darlene is watching what's going down between Seymour and Emily what was my favorite, just because you can see how the entire web of characters is connected and who is double crossing who and why they're doing it. I thought that that was so much fun and I wish it had been the overall theme of the movie. 

Overall, though, that's a minor complaint. Chris Hemsworth was ridiculously creepy as Billy Lee and the ""pick a color"" scene was heart palpation inducing levels of stressful. 

Was it the best movie I've seen this year? No, not really, but man was it fun, and I appreciate it for that alone.  ",9n9qjv
e7wbrdr,"hope this makes sense.. just seen today, but this was mine and a friend's reading of it:

&#x200B;

So they're in purgatory, right?

All these people died, and now they've been thrown together to see if they can repent.

Seymour Sullivan died as a spy, lying and thieving. He's absolved of his sins when he risks (and loses) his life in an attempt to stop a stranger's kidnapping. Emily Summerspring was unable to stop her sister Rose from being killed by her father's domestic abuse, and died believing it to be her fault. She's absolved of her sins by, this time, rescuing Rose from the abuser (Billy). Miles Miller died in the war, and is absolved of his sins when he confesses to Daniel Flynn.

Which brings me on to.. Daniel Flynn is God. There was no heist, that's just the story we and the characters are being told to have it make sense that there's a great big pile of temptation underneath the hotel. Why is there a great big pile of temptation underneath the hotel? Because it's a test, for Darlene Sweet. She hasn't sinned - her back story is just that she sings - but she's a regular human being, and can't be perfect either. So she's being tested, to make sure she's good enough for this film's version of heaven - she's put in a hotel full of murderers and thieves, given the opportunity to kill people, to have Miles kill for her, to look at pornography, to steal a valuable sex tape, and to make off with tons and tons of money. Instead she first declines what's offered to her, then graciously takes it, and even risks her life in front of the mirror for the sake of a man who tried to drug her 20 minutes prior.

Which makes Billy Lee out to be Satan. Surrounded by flames in flashback scenes and the film's present, all he does is try and get each character to sin. For the young girls to fight, for the hostages to throw one another under the bus, for people to look at the tape, for Rose and Emily and his henchmen to kill, etc etc. There are so many references to God through this movie - from Jon Hamm reciting a prayer to his daughter over the phone just ten minutes in, to a priest absolving a man of his sins at the very end.

So. Seymour, Emily and Miles are in their heavens, or have just been 'let go' in some way. Rose died as a kid - therefore innocently, ages ago, and went straight to heaven.  And Daniel Flynn - God - has delivered Darlene Sweet to her heaven - a band, a spotlight, an audience, and an opportunity to sing.",9n9qjv
e7z9abi,"Tarantino lite-ish. All the acting was good, but Thor stole the show. 

That little girl looks identical to Dakota Johnson, it's creepy. 

Cool mystery, with just enough intrigue.

That oner in the hallway as Jon Hamm explores was nicely done. 

Lots of influences from other movies that doesn't quite congeal at the end like it wanted to, kinda like how H8 didn't really fall into place for me either, but again the final act is fun. Nothing groundbreaking but definitely worth a watch to support original movies.",9n9qjv
e81qvae,"Saw this last night , I enjoyed it. I wasn’t enthralled but I enjoyed it. The scene with Darlene and The Father chatting over dinner is excellent especially with what happens next. I liked all the characters except maybe the younger sister. Also found it to be a little too long. ",9n9qjv
e93afhm,"I had mixed feelings about this movie. Well, I am a simple man: I see Jon Hamm in the cast, I find time and money in the limbo to see the bloody movie. But this time, I felt a bit embarrassed of following him to this bomb. 

I guess we're discovering Drew Goddard's narrative style. As soon as I saw Laramie getting shot, I remembered these sudden deaths were used in Netflix's Daredevil Season 1, when Wilson Fisk smashed that poor guy's head in the car door, and later killed Ben Ulrich with bare hands. If using a happy trigger is the way to end every conflict, better watch a war movie.

The second disturbing point for me was Billy Lee insisting to know where did the money come from. I mean, why does it matter? He came for the girl, just get the money and finish the business. All that roulette-and-belly-dancing only led to the most nonsense part of the movie, which is...

The bellboy also can kill! I got it, this is America, anyone is a hero, but how come suddenly the shy and sloppy room attendant becomes a war machine out of the blue? It felt like Goddard was struggling to finish the movie, and Jeff Bridges' characters can't die.

Seriously, the dialogues and parallel stories made me think of Tarantino and Coen Brothers, but if the man responsible for Daredevil's success is gonna be remembered for these moves, I'd rather think twice. It was a good movie, but the storyline and cast deserved better. ",9n9qjv

e7n79c9,"I really enjoyed the movie, but left with a question about the [dual surveillance technologies](#spoiler).  
We can assume:
1) [The hotel has been bugging/recording their rooms for years, likely since they first opened, since the hotel was designed for surveillance](#spoiler).
2) [At some point the FBI installed their own surveillance equipment in Room 1](#spoiler).
3) [Sullivan is assigned to retrieve the FBI equipment.  In the process of doing so, he finds the hotel's own devices](#spoiler).

So, [why weren't the hotel's devices (often hidden in the same places as the FBI equipment) discovered when the FBI installed their bugs at the start of their mission?  It seems like whoever the agent was who installed the FBI bugs would have been grossly negligent not to have noticed that the room was already bugged.

2) Immaculate performances from Erivo, Bridges, Pullman Jr, and Hamm. Johnson certainly left something to be desired.

3) It lacked a catharsis. Erivo felt like the protagonist but at the end it was Miles killing off Emily’s problems. 

4) the MacGuffin bit is overdone.

5) There’s a lot to compare with Tarantino and especially Hateful 8. What H8ful did so well was dole out information and action very well, and then when the third act came, a lot of action and information happened at once. In Bad Times, a lot happens in a few minutes in “present time”, but it’s all padded out because of the flashbacks.

Still an A grade movie and everyone should watch it",9n9qjv

One of my favourite things is how long a lot of the scene are. I'd love to re-watch it with a stopwatch to time the check-in scene, Laramie finding and investigating the secret corridor, Darlene and Flynn getting refreshments, and Billy Lee interrogating everyone. A lot happens, but it's all so well contained within each scene.

Also a very minor detail, but I really liked those stills that introduced each section of the movie (Room One; Room Five; Billy Lee; Reno, etc). At first glance they look uniform, but each of them actually have uniquely patterned / pinstriped corners. Nice touch.",9n9qjv

Also a big fan of the “there’s no pure good, and no pure bad in a person” theme. You can see Flynn really didn’t want to shatter the illusion for Miles that he was a priest because that’s all he was holding onto: the possibility of reconciling his soul before dying. But then he takes on that role again because he’s not purely a bad person. Miles laying on the line separating the states represented the moral grey area between good and bad. Beautiful visual.",9n9qjv
e7mbqau,"Got strong Hateful Eight vibes from this, though I feel like that was intentional. While the script could have been a bit tighter, the entire cast killed it (particularly Lewis Pullman and Cailee Spaeny), the plot was beautifully unpredictable, and my eyes were feasting on the cinematography from the first scene to the last. 

8.5/10",9n9qjv

e7m7qx1,"It was so punishingly long with no big payout at the end. Felt purposeless. I walked out with the sensation that I’d just seen a standard high school theater department murder mystery, but without the emotional payoff of being proud of the actors. Cinematography was good, and the actors tried, but the characters and stories weren’t compelling enough to engage the audience through the needlessly lengthy, meandering runtime. Jon Hamm might have been able to save it if they hadn’t wasted him in the first act. ",9n9qjv
e7ohb84,"I think there was pacing problems in this movie and probably could of cut about 15-20 mins without missing much.  
  
Despite that gripe, I actually thought it was a very good movie with a great ensemble especially Lewis Pullman and Cynthia Erivo (amazing voice).  
   
I honestly didn’t mind most of the unanswered questions in the end because the film’s main focus was on the souls of the characters. Darlene was really a lost soul trying to find her voice. Flynn was a repentant soul who’s dying and searching for one last memory, Miles is a tortured soul seeking forgiveness, and so on.  
  
I would say 8/10 and could of used more of Hamm’s character ",9n9qjv
e7zn6co,"I loved Goddard's The Cabin in the Woods so I was sad to be let down by this. The first 45 minutes were very intriguing and the set up had the potential to lead to an incredibly interesting mystery a la Agatha Christie, but the story really petered out after that and it doesn't help that the film's 141 minute runtime is really felt. Cynthia Erivo and Lewis Pullman were fantastic, but I think Hemsworth was a bit miscast as Lee. I thought that character needed an actor would could sell Lee's menace more, like a Matthew McConaughey or Boyd Holbrook even. Goddard's visual style is strong and he employs some great lingering static and tracking shots, but his directorial prowess just never made up for the uninteresting and stretched-out narrative. I know I'll be in the minority.

Can't wait to see smarter people than me dissect all the symbolism eventually.

I see some people saying that Hemsworth was miscast because he was really just hollow charisma without much else, but wasn't that kind of the point? Doesn't Darlene straight up say as much in her speech to him? Seems to me he was pretty perfect for the role.",9n9qjv
e7rvqcu,"I've not seen this posted anywhere (though I only made it through 200 of 1100 comments) , but leaving the theater my friend threw out an idea that hadn't crossed my mind... Was the ending alluding to the fact that maybe Father Flynn didn't make it through the night? We know he was given roughly six months to live about six months ago. The way he said ""I'd love that"" about seeing her perform the next night Reno was an oddly delivered line (just before he was bashed). He showed up in all white and didn't say anything. Maybe he was the one who was redeemed before his death by helping her. ",9n9qjv
e7sgirl,"So I think Billy Lee was the third robber and here’s why.  The robbery took place 10 years before.  Father Flynn served 10 years of his 15 year sentence.  So Billy would have been in his early 20s.  His mask was never removed but Flynn did remove his mask at one point.  The kid from the robbery would therefore know his face.  So when they met again he immediately made it clear that he knew Father Flynn was not a real priest.  How would he know that? Another piece of evidence is when Darlene corrected Flynn when he said “the money is mine” and she said “no, it’s ours”, Billy then corrects them both and says “you got the score wrong”, hinting that it should be split 3 ways and not 2 ways.  Billy also sarcastically asked Flynn “who else would come looking for this money” but Flynn has lost most of his memories and even admits “everyone else who knew is dead” because he probably forgot about the kid and never even saw his face.  I loved the movie but felt there were a ton of plot holes like why the hotel was being investigated and why room 1 was bugged and who the “unfamiliar big devices” belonged to.  Obviously it was being investigated by someone other than the FBI as well. I was also waiting for an answer as to why the news kept talking about the two murders in Miami. And of course the tape.  Hopefully it’s all just a big lead-in for a sequel. ",9n9qjv
e7uapcu,"The beginning was really good, up until the cult leader came into the story. After that bit I feels like they rush through the third act and the character development slows down. The dialogue wasn’t anything special but I did love the priests character and the cop at the beginning. 

I thought it got a bit cheesy at parts like the constant singing and the part where the priests getting the money out and she’s clapping at the same times as him using tools. 

The use of colour was pretty good in this movie and the cinematography is constant all the way through the movie.

Flynn was losing his mind and talking in his sleep. He could have easily said something about the hidden loot and then a cell mate or someone could have told Darlene to follow Flynn when he was released from prison. Even the third partner or whoever planned the heist could've sent Darlene to follow Flynn to see where he left the money.

Or maybe that did happen and she just never double crossed him because she ended up liking Flynn.

e81mpal,"Browsing this thread it seems like I’m alone here, but I am not as enthralled by this movie as others here seem to be. Don’t get me wrong, there were things to love (the state line, fantastic jump scares, creepy peeping Toms, and fucking Miles stole the show), but I generally found the film to be a bit self-indulgent.

Drew Goddard had pretty much complete control over this thing and while I’m a huge fan of studios giving money to visionary writer/directors, I think he could’ve used a little reigning in. The runtime is exorbitant, and I think this plays out more than anything in just the length of some scenes. They just seem to drag on and on, generally starting out wonderfully but unable to retain the same level of dramatic tension. 

And the flashbacks. I love fully fleshed out characters as much as the next guy, but some of these just went too far. They were all artful but I’m not sure if any (besides Billy Lee’s and maybe Miles’) were honestly necessary for the telling of the story. To me, it felt like Goddard was a juggler, extremely deft at keeping all the balls in the air, but performing for no real reason other than because he wanted to. 

Last thing that I didn’t understand and would be happy for someone to clear up. Why did John Hamm’s character have to work for the FBI? Is there literally any reason that it was beneficial to the story other than the fact that he took the wires out of their cars? He could have just seen Emily dragging Rose to the room and gone in to help as a good samaritan.  Pretty sure all the other outcomes would have been about the same. Maybe I’m just confused on that one.

All in all, it was a fun movie for sure. Miles Miller is absolutely awesome and I want a stand-alone movie. But I think the film as a whole just kind of lacked a spark I was expecting given how great Goddard’s precious work was.

EDIT: Hamm was FBI, not CIA.",9n9qjv

e7umv8y,"I just came from a showing of the movie and I think
Pros: 
1. The best part of the movie is Jon Hamm's terrible bayou accent and name Laramie. It seemed so laughably bad, more like someone doing foghorn leghorn until [it's revealed that he's actually an fbi agent.](#spoiler) It really showed Jon Hamms ability as an actor but the context gave it a nuance the film could have used more of. It's a touch that humanized the character for me a lot.
2. The suspenseful aspects of the movie had me wretching. When the movie just lets things flow without exposition, it really works.
3. It's getting kind of cliche, but Jeff Bridges knocks out another great performance as ""Old man who is tired""
Cons: 
1. I think the director thinks the audience is pretty dumb. I felt like I was getting knocked over the head that [the little girl murdered people when they kept flashing back to her with a knife over dead bodies, and then hemsworth yells out did you tell them what she did](#spoiler). or [Jon Hamm puts on detective glasses saying out loud, I'm special agent so and so](#spoiler). I kind of wish the director would have just let us piece some things together or left us with impressions to draw our own conclusions. There's a flashback showing every aspect, and that removes allegory and mystery from the film and takes away from it, i think. 

2. Not a fan of hemsworth in this at all. I don't think he pulled off being that charismatic, and his accent was really bad. It's between him and Hamm for worst accent and I think [Hamm's bad accent was done for a really great reason. He's playing an fbi agent undercover and i loved that to represent that, Hamm seems to intentionally do a terrible accent](#spoiler). He did a pretty job of being creepy, but that was more of the fact that this is an obviously adult man who is molesting a teenager. His entrance was way too telegraphed. I wretched at the scene of him on the beach. The delivery of the dialogue about what state she's in was pretty awful.

3. This was a really soft r rating. Some of the scenes could have used more intensity to show the magnitude of the scene. When the manager is describing the horrible things he's witnessed, I wanted more than just fucking. When [john ham gets blown by the shotgun](#spoiler) I want to see him in with more gore than a spray of mist. Dakota Johnson mentions the shooting saying he was blown in half, but when Darlene recovers the gun and keys from his body, it's all intact. Imagine if she had to move her hand through his viscera to get the keys. It would have shown her desperation and fear of the situation more. Also, I would have loved a scene where they had reels of stuff played during the menacing scene of the reels of the recording played.

All in all, it was a pretty fun movie to watch with friends. I think Hamm stole the show, Bridges, Eviro, Johnson did a great job. I hadn't seen Pullman before, but he did a great job for the material given to him, and maybe the actor's actor out of the cast. The creepy girl and Hemsworth were pretty terrible and one dimensional.

Editing was the downfall of the movie. Too much explanation, it made a fun concept a lot dumber. The cinematography was really nice, and some of the framing shots with the mirrors and doors was nice.",9n9qjv
e7ux96m,"Just saw it, genuinely loved it, probably the most fun I've had at a movie this year. I loved all the seedy, disparate threads, I loved seeing everything go to shit again and again, and I loved the resolution. Great performances all around, everybody was fun to watch in one way or another.

This is another movie that was just severely underserved by its trailer. I don't know what's going on with trailers this year, but it feels like they're reaching new heights of burning footage while completely failing to appeal.

Holy shit though, guns are sledgehammers in the El Royale. Catch a bullet and you're liable to be thrown through a wall.",9n9qjv
e7yr6kw,"So I happened to watch this again and honestly, I still really like it. I guess what I noticed better this time was that it’s not necessarily “too long”, as it’s more so unevenly paced - the beginning is perfect, the middle sort of stretches out with several flashbacks that probably could’ve been shortened, and so the final act comes as a surprise and then goes too fast. Bits here and there that could’ve been changed or cut but ultimately it’s just really entertaining and highly charismatic. I reckon it may have quite a long ‘lifespan’ ahead, given there wasn’t really a moment I was bored or out of it mentally even when watching for a 2nd time. There were a few “what ifs” or “could have beens” but  in retrospect it’s not a huge deal. 

The cast is truly great, there’s nothing more I could add that others haven’t already said. Loved how none of the characters (except for Billy Lee) were truly evil and never ended up as surprise cliche villains with their “aha!” moments (but then again, I did see a few things coming based on trailers). All of them were more or less just victims of the circumstances they happened by in their lives, something they desperately tried to escape from, even if that meant bad choices were to be made. The soundtrack is freaking amazing, and so is the cinematography. And the viiiiiibes  and overall style of this film ugh. Some scenes will linger in my mind for a bit longer. Paid more attention to little details this time, which I liked. The themes of the story are also cool - not new per se, but presented in a relatively unique fashion. I guess it’s just not everybody’s cup of tea, and it’s not overly hard to see why, but in some strange way it’s just a lovable movie. ",9n9qjv
e7n3gqa,"Two questions: 

1) What was Jon Hamm investigating exactly? Was his suspicion that this hotel was spying on it's guests, or was it Nixon spying or something like that? 

2) When Miles brings up the fact that he is a killer, are we to believe that all of his killings as a soldier, or has he actually murdered people since the war illegally? ",9n9qjv

I think I gasped out loud when they revealed the mirror to be a hidden spying chamber, but that was probably it—oh and when Cynthia Erivo smashed that bottle on Jeff Bridges' head that gave me a scare. Also I was blown away by how Cailee Spaeny looked so much like Dakota Johnson; and I was definitely getting pedophilia vibes from Chris Hemsworth character + Cailee Spaeny character—it just felt so weird when she was so infatuated with someone who is clearly older. ALSO Jon Hamm DIED way too early!!!! And I recognised Manny Jacinto even though he was in the background with no lines...

I hope someone sells the hotel key tag as merchandise I would buy that!

e7m5ngn,"Just saw it, I wanted to love it because the cinematography/sets were outstanding and because dark stormy nights are my aesthetic.  However it was around 30 minutes too long, by the end when they started up the hotel clerk's backstory I honestly was rolling my eyes.  The first 30 minutes with the opening scene and the characters waiting in the lobby/picking their rooms was all great, after that it seemed to be missing something.",9n9qjv
e7ymu18,"The ending dragged on for too long, and there was no satisfying resolution making the film a bit boring. 

I don't think Hemsworth knew what he was doing here, except for being shirtless 24/7 which seems to be the only reason he amassed a cult of people willing to kill for him. His appearance at the end really slowed the film down, when it should've given it a quick and grand spin-off. 

Other than that, I think the character with perhaps the most interesting storyline was killed off too soon (the FBI agent) and we were never given a reason as to why Rosie betrayed her sister in such an awful way. 

Bad Times at the El Royale has a really big plot and some good performances (with too much singing though), but fails to live up to films that clearly inspired it. 4/10.",9n9qjv
e7o53vz,"Just left the theater about half an hour ago. I’m still digesting it, but I don’t think I’m as high on it as most here. Stylistically it was amazing. I loved the music, and there were some great individual scenes. The first hour had me on the edge of my seat. But I felt like the pacing wasn’t great and by the end I was just wishing they would get to the point already. I left feeling like it was a somewhat forgettable story. 

I liked the movie, just not as much as I expected to. Probably a 7-7.5 for me. ",9n9qjv
e7npev8,"It's good, but not great. I know that sounds basic. 

This is a good looking feature, Drew Goddard certainly nails that. The acting is great, standouts being Jeff Bridges (if this had a stronger plot, he'd be a contender for Best Supporting Actor in my opinion), Lewis Pullman, Cynthia Erivo, and Chris Hemsworth, though it's kind of disappointing that the marketing revolved around him a ton and he's not in it in earnest until the final act. 

Of course it's one of those ""everything gets intertwined"" plots, but I don't know, the actual reasons for some of these people being there are truly uninteresting and honestly, the most interesting reason for a character being there gets introduced but dropped pretty fast in Hamm. The secret about the hotel and what it actually does that gets brought up consistently but the true reason for why and the purpose for so kind of peters out after the first act. 

Some scenes are great and truly unforgettable, but others feel like a lesser Quentin Tarantino movie without the compelling dialogue or characters outside of maybe two.  

Lastly, it is just too long. I definitely felt the 2:30ish length. 

Still, it's worth a view. No real substance outside of some brief allusion to feminism. I'd say a 6.5/10, maybe 7. 
",9n9qjv
e7o8l3a,"I was hoping the whole time Offerman was on screen that he wasn't going to get shot in that hotel room. Even though I knew it was to good to be true that he'd have a big part to play in this movie. Pretty pissed off about that bit of advertising, but it's a fair play.

Overall I enjoyed myself, the movie was slow at times but I never felt myself drifting away from it, just every now and then I'd go 'not a whole bunch is happening here.' I think the quality dipped when Jon Hamm died, he was driving the movie along and without his energy I think it suffered until Hemworth entered.

The hotel boy ended up being one of my favorite characters and I really enjoyed his arc (though I think I may have been happier if he'd been killing people in the hotel, not just in Vietnam.) Father Flynn and Darlene's chemistry was really nice as well. 

The biggest moment in my theatre was after Darlene smashed Father Flynn over the head with the bottle. We'd been lulled to safety by everything up to that point and when the cue card came up after that moment I noticed maybe 50% of the audience sit up straighter and lean forward ready to go for the ride. But I don't think it ever lived up to where we thought it was going to go. 

Still a 7/10 for me. It's a disappointing 7 though as I thought we'd be getting a 9 from that trailer.",9n9qjv
e7o9jl3,"I liked it. I enjoyed the vignette style of going from room to room and exploring each character's background individually. Jon Hamm's death took me by surprise and I especially liked the nonlinear timeline showing that scene from different perspectives. 

Chris Hemsworth's character felt a bit generic, maybe he would have benefited from more exploration. Also, as much as I loved the concierge, I think his backstory was a bit useless. We're left in suspense, wondering how he's killed so many people, and then it turns out he was just a soldier, kinda a bland explanation. Nonetheless, the confession scene at the end was excellent and a highlight of the movie.",9n9qjv

e7x241u,"My review, and I was sat as close as humanly possible to the screen which may have affected my opinion:  


It's fantastic. One of the best of the years so far (right behind Blindspotting). I can't say it's an all-time classic, there's something I can't quite put my finger on that is holding me back from going that far, but the movie is good from start to finish. Just a solid, entertaining movie. Can't see anyone not enjoying themselves, and I expect this movie has a long life ahead of it.

&#x200B;

My one complaint, and it's not really a complaint. Chris Hemsworth, very, very likable. Absolutely looks like the greasy, beautiful, hippy god he is supposed to be playing, and the character of Billy Lee should be a career defining character that goes down with the likes of Buffalo Bill or Nurse Ratchet, but.... he just doesn't quite hit a home run here. He's very good, but I think he could've stolen the whole movie, but instead is just perfectly adequate. I think I would've liked to have seen him push the inner conflict between the charming manipulator and the violent maniac a little bit further. Maybe it's cliche, but he seems too under control for a character who seems to live for a type of chaos. Or, maybe there could have been a hint of a lust for power. I don't know. This is a small complaint. He was fine. Really good even. Just thought it could have gone a tad further.",9n9qjv

The script had elements I liked and interpreted as meta -- the observation corridor and two-way mirrors as the audience's role as voyeur, and the jukebox's similarity to the ""monster boxes"" in *Cabin in the Woods* -- modules that a writer can queue up and use as needed. Visually it looked nice; I loved the lighting of Darlene and Father Flynn in the car in the rain.

e7mc2kd,"Just stepped out of the theater, it really had me invested the whole time, super entertaining! In hindsight, there were so many red herrings that I thought would go somewhere and were just to throw the viewer off. Including (but not limited to):

* Management being mentioned but never showing up
* Who was on the tape? Doesn't matter

e7qfljl,"All in all, this movie was...pretty good. Excellent performances all around, gorgeous visually, some nice dialogue.

I just have an issue with the plot in general. It felt *very* flat and one-note. The movie had a very nasty habit of immediately explaining mysteries or plots the minute after they're introduced. Holy shit, the hippie has a tied up and gagged victim? Oh, right after that we're told they're sisters and she's rescuing him from a ""bad man"". Wonder if that's referring to the guy in the flashback 10 seconds ago? Over a dozen listening devices, wiretaps, and a hidden observation room? What could be happening? Oh, it's just a blackmail setup in a plot that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie and just sets up a McGuffin. The sleazy vacuum salesman has a kit of strange tools and knows how to fleece a room for listening devices? Who *is* he? Oh, he's a government agent. The government agent finds out about the supposedly kidnapped girl? The agency told him to just let her suffer! WHAT WILL HE DO? Oh, he just immediately knocks on the door, backhands the kidnapper, forgets all about her, dies, and is mostly forgotten by the plot. Uh oh! The creepy ""bad man"" has shown up and he has cronies! How will this affect our ensemble cast? Oh, he just immediately grabs them all without any struggle and ties everyone up neatly for the finale. Thanks for the nice flashback showing us why we should be afraid of him.

I found it insulting and how little all the different plots develop before being cut short and replaced with the Charles Manson Variety Hour annoyed me. I was *hoping* that the movie would be about the ensemble cast having a bunch of intrigue and tension with each other and their own personal plots, before a monkey wrench gets thrown into their plans by the sudden arrival of a literal cult leader. That's a very interesting premise to me but the intrigue kind of ended when Jon Hamm got killed.",9n9qjv
e7s3hcr,"very average quentin tarantino style movie.

great cast, and very well acted. you come here for cynthia erivo and jeff bridges though. I liked the way the story played out, seeing the same scenes from different character perspectives. I thought the beginning scene introducing the characters and hotel to us was great (shoutout to Jon Hamm and that accent/attitude lol)

cons though, Hamm's character kind of led to nothing really. I don't remember any kind of pay off with the FBI link (unless the FBI were the people that took the footage the kid shot of guests, in which case that flew over my head completely). 
Same goes for Dakota Johnson, her story was riveting and the sister connection was great, but she just...dies? we get zero payoff, it felt like a twist for a twists sake. the sister gave two fucks, and then she also dies later. what was the point of that? How did dakota kidnap her sister, what led the sister to commit those murders? To many set ups with no solid payoff

but again, cynthia erivo is great here. She is a star in the making. the tracking shot in the hotel room while she sings is fantastic. Her vibe with bridges was great, I'm very excited to see her role in widows now.",9n9qjv

e7n3ts5,"I watched this film last week and really enjoyed it. It may be one of my favorite films that I've watched this year right next to Annihilation and Sorry to Bother you. Although it was predictable at certain points I appreciated how the majority of the film kept me guessing on what would happen next and wondering which character was hiding a hidden to them. 

The best and worst thing about the film was it's editing though. It had masterfully edited scenes that really heightened the tension of each scene. But on the other side there were terribly long sequences that dragged on for far too long. The movie could've been cut down at least 20 minutes from it's relatively long runtime. I think part of the issue have these Tarantino-esque scenes full of dialogue that drag on. The problem here is that the writing isn't as interesting as typical Tarantino dialogue so the scene kinda falls flat. 

Overall though, I really enjoyed the film and would recommend it to everybody. A solid 9/10.

e7qp7px,"I’m utterly confused. I saw this film 2 nights ago & can’t stop thinking about it. The concept and idea is amazing, but the film wasn’t. So many unanswered questions, but pointless scenes. What was the deal with Hamm? What was his relevance? Who is management? Nothing ties in. There’s no satisfaction, no closure, no great twists. The scene when the corridor is uncovered was wonderful. And Darlene singing in her room, was chillingly beautiful. And Miles’ uncovered past & shoot out was hugely unexpected & the only great twist of the movie. But, what was the point of any of it? I thought the California/Nevada aspect would have had greater influence, a consequence of choice. It seemed to be a huge part of the story, but have no meaning or point. I left the cinema feeling unsatisfied & annoyed. And yet, I can’t get the film out of my head. The film was full of great scenes and incredibly shot, but was ultimately very slow. I expected some answer, any answer, some relevance to the hotel that the film is built on. But the hotel seemed to have no real placement. Can someone help shed some light on my scrambled brain?

Ultimately, I was disappointed. But I can’t stop thinking about it. Is this the films intention? Is it in fact an amazing work designed to leave an audience questioning everything?

It was far too long and the dialogue and story weren't as good as Tarantino to really justify the length. The story was also told mostly in a linear way (unlike something like Pulp Fiction) so the minor overlaps in the story weren't very interesting. ",9n9qjv
e7m5ten,"The first three quarters were so great but then it just derailed at the end. Billy Lee's charachter made no sense. Why did he care where the money came from? It was cash, just take it and leave. Or else have the scene be him torturing Emily to show his other cult followers that they can't leave. Endlessly questioning Jeff Bridges and the singer about where the money came from didn't make any sense, it's not a mystery he should have cared to solve. 

That being said, the first 3/4 are fucking brilliant. I loved the way the film kept changing which character was in control of a scene. It was fantastic and I think the scene with John Hamm discovering the two ways mirrors was one of the best, most suspenseful things I've seen. ",9n9qjv

Built up a bunch of storylines that never had any closure. There was no plot to this movie at all, a bunch of weird storylines as an excuse for small character explorations but why? 

I was willing to tolerate the slow burn nature of the film for a huge payoff that I expected but never came.

e7rye5m,"Goddamn discussion threads posting Thursday leave my Sunday viewing ass in the dust.

It's not slick and focused enough to get away with its lack of thematic heft, really. The performances are all fine but drip with the movie as it goes along, it gets too cute with layering backstories, and the pacing is so stop/start that it makes it all the harder to care about the ""complexities"" of what's ultimately a story that ceases to be interesting beyond its premise.

Appearances are deceiving is underwhelming, to say the least. The truly interesting parts of this hotel - the state divide, even the hallway - never prove to mean much. It's a humdrum story with so much video store knockoff window dressing and 40 minutes too many. ",9n9qjv

The movie needed more John Hamm! His story line and acting added that needed energy to the movie, but sadly he died to early. 

 Bridges did a great Bridges! His character was on point, but he always delivers. You can’t go wrong with this guy. 

Boots! Did a great job.  She didn’t have a lot of lines so she had to completely build a believable character using her eyes and body language.

One of the best scenes of the first hour was the observation corridor introduction (with the haunting singing echoing throughout). In fact, the corridor scenes are some of the films best, most creative. I enjoyed the non linear time jumping storytelling as well. It was a bit coen brothers and a bit tarantino.

The sound design is impeccable, phenomenal. Some of the loud moments out of the silence really caught me (like a jump scare). Definitely sound editing and mixing deserve oscar noms if not wins. Its been a great year for sound in film. Also good use of licensed music and awesome singing the aunty.

The problem is that the ending and main characters (Father Flynn and Darlene) are really the sideshow for most of the movie. The characters a developed really well, and that's because we see them and how they react to everything else that's going on. 

With most of the movie revolving around Emily and Rose, the killing of John Hamm, Billy Leen etc.... that is the story line we get invested in. Its not Father Flynn getting the money back or Darlene's singing career.",9n9qjv

e7rgcfu,"This was not a good film. 

It wasn't all bad. It had good parts to it. The intrigue surrounding the hidden corridors and one-way mirrors and bugs, the concept of how these characters' lives intertwine in a kind of Altman-esque manner, and some genuinely clever scenes like with the clapping and hammering. In fact, I'd say most of the film was composed of good parts. 

Unfortunately, film is typically a narrative medium, so if you're going to make a 2 hour and 22 minute film, it will usually need some sort of actual throughline rather than just being a succession of vaguely interesting or aesthetic set pieces. Bad Times did not have that. 

The only actual sense I can make out of the film is that Goddard is somehow framing the rise of cults in America in the midcentury as a nihilistic response to the moral crises of the 60s, but the film as a whole is so bad that it seems unlikely. Even if that is the case, that doesn't change the fact that it's executed very, very poorly.

There were too many characters and subplots which led to the first 2/3 dragging a bit. But I also felt that the characters could've all been fleshed out just a little more.

I think they could've thrown in one or two more characters, expound on what they had and this would've made a hell of an 8-episode miniseries. Instead the movie felt sluggish and bloated at times. I still liked it better than most movies I've seen this year.",9n9qjv

Complete WASTE of Jon Hamm, the third act was awful, killed off Dakota Johnson's character pointlessly and just for shock value (or to show the audience how Rosie would react, I don't know?). 

Was good on the first half before Jon Hamm's character died, Chris Hemsworth's character was the least intimidating villain I have seen since Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor, and couldn't take him seriously at all. The only good parts technically speaking were the directing, lighting and song choices.

Style over substance.  Fun set piece and has the makings of a premise.  Solid performances by most.  I give it 57.6 out of 100.",9n9qjv
e7pr7mg,"I thought the first half was very good. I was interested in Cynthia Erivo, Jon hamm, and Jeff Bridges’ characters. All three give good performances. It lost me when it started the half-baked story about the hippie cult. I loved the concept of a sleazy hotel with mirror windows, secret political doings, and the California/Nevada divide angle. It would have been amazing if it had been 1.5-2 hours.

On the good, I praise Erivo’s performance, the original concept, the use of diagetic and non-diagetic music, and the cinematography.

The pacing of the third act was atrocious, especially the editing of the scene with all the characters tied up in the lobby. Perhaps it would be better if they hired better actors who can keep things tense, but they hired Dakota Johnson, Chris Hemsworth, and Bill Pullman’s son, none of whom are amazing or intense actors, so it fell flat. Imagine that scene with actors like Brad Pitt (cult leader), Paul Dano (quiet, forgettable, but crazy receptionist), and Dakota Fanning (Emily) in those roles and I can see that scene making a bigger impression.

Plot lines and devices were presented then dropped. The Malibu murder story is obviously supposed to tie in, but is never resolved (is that who rose killed?). Why did Darlene haul in two huge blanket rolls? Who owns the hotel? Why bother presenting that potentially interesting idea of these powerful, violent owners then never go with it?

Everyone behaves like a movie character/plot device, not like any real person. All the henchmen, Dakota, and Chris are killed and die instantly; whereas, miles takes a year and a half to die while characters just stand around a burning building waiting. Flynn immediately, conveniently forgives Darlene for clocking him. When Emily drags rose in the room for the first time, she just leaves the door open and weapons lay out. Who rose killed and what she did is too ambiguous. Why was Emily even at the cult? How does Darlene know Emily is on the other side of the mirror when they dig up the money? Who killed nick offerman and why didn’t they just dig up the money? Why did Chris hemsworth bother with Darlene and Flynn? The answer to most of these questions is: because the movie needed them to so we could have X scene or X plot. 

I don’t mind a little ambiguity. For example, I like that we never know the public figure in the sex tape. It’s a huge person, who speaks beautifully, and is dead. It could be a Kennedy or MLK. 

All in all, I’d say it’s more of a mediocre time than a bad time. An original idea that devolves into a formulaic crime movie. ",9n9qjv

I appreciate that it felt contained, there were allusions to “management” and whatever was on the film but it always stayed within the stories of the people at the hotel. Toward the end it dragged a little bit but I like the pacing in general, a lot of good tension built up by each backstory. I read some reviews that wished it had been a little more twisted but I appreciated that it wasn’t too self indulgent (compared to another movie about strangers meeting in an enclosed shelter and gradually killing each other).

Great to see Dakota Johnson doing something a little more on her level. Rest of the cast was great too and it felt like everyone was onscreen exactly enough (except Hemsworth, could have used a little more of him).",9n9qjv

>The visuals were great, the editing was stylish, and there was some twists I didn’t see coming.

>The movie’s pacing is what bogs it down imo. We see different perspectives, get backstory on all the characters. The movies third act definitely had me checking my watch.  
>  
>But it was good. Worth a trip to the theater.

Now spoilers:

* I did not like Hemsworth's character all that much. He had too little screentime and I felt Chris might have been miscast in the role because he didn't come off all that frightening.
* I didn't like that the trailers were a bit misleading. I know they were being intentionally secretive but I would've preferred something more supernatural bringing them to that hotel. Instead, it was just a pervy hotel that these characters were randomly just staying at for various reasons.
* Who killed Nick Offerman in the beginning? I didn't catch that part and thought it would play into the larger story.

But seriously, if Tarantino had written this, it would've been considered a recycling of the Hateful 8 plot. The combination of chaptered story telling, classic charming protagonist's early death, Jeff Bridges' old man, mentally unstable female character, casual racism, late addition of a main character causing a plot shake up, bloodbath, and team of unlikely survivors make for a very Tarantino film. I'm starting to think the mystery of the film was a nod to the golden suitcase in pulp fiction, and the name 'El Royale' is a nod to the Royale with Cheese.

The characters and revelations were well written enough to draw attention away from the trope, but once the credits rolled, the reality really set in that this wasn't a Quentin flick.",9n9qjv
e7wfvgp,"I enjoyed this up until Hemworth showed up, and then the whole movie seemed to start to drag - which is a shame because the trailer made it look like he was there to make things exciting. Especially the scene around the roulette table where there wasn't much tension because in the end nobody died who you didn't expect to die (because they were an underwritten nothing of a character). They could have taken a good fifteen minutes out and had themselves a really good movie.

Between that scene and the cult speech scene I think Hemworth is probably the wrong actor for the part. He did well looking a bit unsure at the moment he gets 'called out' by Darlene, but for the most part it was like he had the wrong sort of charisma for the role. It's the Hemsworth 'hot, nice guy' charisma playing bad, rather than the 'cool, charming, gets in your head' type charisma I expect most cult leaders have. Edit: I think if he was merely the twisted psycho lover who dragged Rose to the dark side, rather than a full-on cult leader, the way he played it would have worked better.

e7qi7nn,"Ok, this is just bizarre to me that people keep using MLK as the potential culprit on the infamous film. Does anyone not remember that it was clearly mentioned that it was a dead senator on the film??? Where's the MLK conspiracy coming from? Also, everyone keeps mentioning JFK? Am I missing something here?? It sounds like EVERYONE is way off track. I was thinking Bobby Kennedy, not JFK, and not MLK? MLK makes zero sense being that it was mentioned that it was a senator on the film. Also, Bobby was a senator from 1965-1968. He was a Kennedy. Maybe it's possible MLK was a person the FBI wanted dirt on, but on the actual film reel, it was mentioned that it was a senator that had already died. I also believe that Billy Lee's crew was involved in the murders that is reported in the background on the TV. Rose was apparently responsible for at least one of those brutal deaths. I had assumed that Miles was fresh from Vietnam being that he was still pretty young. Does anyone know the relevance of the Nevada/California state line being so prominent as a focus point throughout the movie? It seems to have more of an underlying relevance to the story. I mean, the guy died exactly on the split line of the 2 states. I'm currently scratching my head about it, sorta overthinking it to be honest. I think the El Royale was literally a place for people to do devious things in between their Vegas/California stay. The laws were apparently different between the 2 states, so the FBI used that kid to spy on the guests. Perhaps supplying him with heroine, as well (tho I could just be getting way ahead of myself with that.. lol) Anyway...what are your thoughts? I just saw the movie an hour ago, so I'm very pumped about yappin and readin about it😂. ",9n9qjv

1. Did it ever explain why the singer smashed the priest with the bottle?

2. The murders on the TV news... was this supposed to be perpetrated by Billy Lee’s Manson-esque cult?

3. Who was on the film? All I could guess was it was one of Hoover’s rumored sexual “things” but was it odd that they never said? Was this supposed to be another Tarantino nod a la Pulp Fiction briefcase?

4. What War was the clerk in? Korean, I guess? What appeared to be a helicopter crash threw me off.

e7qgmeg,"The performances and staging were wonderful, but the plot was terrible!

Why would Darlene Sweet (and really, she's not someone else pretending to be a singer? I thought she was going to be an agent of a foreign power, thereby tying Hamm's plot back into the mix) so *violently* attack Bridges? From what we're shown, she couldn't even see that he had tried to poison her, and even if she had, thats an extremely specific reaction (not to mention reaction time).    Also what was her backstory?  I couldn't follow -- the evil musicman was offering to make her a star if she gave him a year of her time?  (Was their some sexual assault pay-to-play undertone to that I missed?)

What the hell was Hamm there to do again?  He was surprised to find the extent of surveillance equipment in the room, but why was he there to begin with?  Was it to setup new surveillance? No one high stakes was coming to the hotel anymore.  So . . . wha?

When did Johnson kidnap her sister?  Was it after she stabbed the couple in the news?  Was Johnson apart of that stabbing? Had she fallen in with the cult, and that was the straw that broke the camels back?

Was Pullman/the Concierge supposed to be a serial killer?!  It was interesting to see his survivors guilt, but how did he go from Vietnam vet to shady-hotel concierge?  Why would he make that jump given his guilt about doing bad things?  Why did he not know to get away from the window if he was vet? Bridges knew and he was a two-bit failed crook!

Hemsworth was just a walking third act without any connection to the rest.  I honestly wasn't all that menaced by him either! The danger of his obvious good looks are less effective when he's directly so violent.  I expected to feel the terror from his smile, but instead he just slams things down and closes the loop on his plot thread by killing Johnson (kudos to the movie though for having that plot fail).

Also that ending! Wuuuttttt the fuck?  So he just buys a leisure suit and goes and hear's her perform?!  He didn't double-cross her or anything?  This wasn't purgatory or hell and he was the literal devil?!??! Ugh.",9n9qjv

Sound design was good but undercut by nondiagetic music telling the audience how to feel.  The set design and blocking were great, but not utilized well. Action sequences, such as they were, didn't take advantage of the established geography. Camera work was basic, always framing to center and only worked in middle depth. A strong cast did what they could with thin scripts. Darleen should have been the central character but lacked screen time, and her story doesn't tie in to the climax at all. Predictable.

e7q5tos,"I’d say it was a solid film, though I felt like the writers came up with all these great backstories and an end goal, but in an attempt to pull everything together they just fabricated Hemsworth’s character to be a cult leader that fills in some of the gaps. And speaking of gaps, ambiguity helps the film at times, not always. 

Obviously not saying what was on the film was by design. But what about the homicides that appear on the television in the beginning? And Rose just killing someone we don’t know of? 

They also didn’t give enough reason to make Billy Lee an asshole but he’s utilized as one to make the film progress. Okay yes he has some under-aged girl brainwashed, but by what means? Was the cult a sex cult? 

That being said, this film did well with the screenplay and small details for the most part. The length was a double-edged sword. Fleshing out a movie is never a bad thing in my opinion, though the quality seems to go up and down as time goes on.",9n9qjv

Two way mirrors in a hotel, yeah thats never been done before.

The FBI vacuum guy is going to interfere in the kidnapping after being told not to, its just way too obvious.

Billy Lee, why do you give a \*\*\*\* about the truth behind the money, and whether or not he's a real priest, just kill them and take it and go home, they dont matter to your character at all.

Miles don't walk up behind Rose right after u killed Thor, she's going to kill you. DUH!

When Miles was dying I thought please God don't let there be a scene where Jeff Bridges pretends to actually be a priest and then absolve him of his sins, and holy \*\*\*\* hes doing exactly that, just kill me now. That sequence didn't need to be in the film at all, it was a waste of time.

A hotel between California and Nevada is a great plot device that had absolutely no relevance in the film whatsoever.

I don't understand why Jeff Bridges pretends to be a priest and his baffling logic was ""people don't ask questions"" It made no sense and served no purpose. It's not like he was an assassin on a job.

It feels like its trying to be a Tarantino movie but totally misses because of poor character development.

There's also a contrast between Laramie and miles, as they both are faced with an option to interfere or not. Both make the choice to interfere, but the outcome in the case of Laramie shows the world doesn't necessarily care about the morals behind your choice.

He killed Offerman so he could take all the money but presumably couldn’t find it in the room and wasn’t aware of the floorboards plan.

Who Management is is intentionally left vague but their intentions were to blackmail notable figures with footage/audio recorded from the rooms. Given that it’s set just before the Cold War, I think it would be reasonable to infer that it’s Russia.

Billy killed Emily because he’s crazy, she turned against the cult, and he was probably gonna kill all of
them eventually anyways because they were witnesses.

As for Larry, there were a couple Schur-verse actors showing up in small parts here. Jim O’Heir, Nick Offerman, and Manny Jacinto (who I saw in the credits but don’t remember seeing in the movie). I know Goddard is an executive producer on The Good Place so maybe he’s just tight with all those guys.

e7ppjg2,"Yeah, it was not clear who rose killed. I figure it could be her father, but there’s also the recurring footage of a Malibu couple that just got killed. That story was never wrapped up explicitly, so it could have been them?",9n9qjv
e7maibi,[deleted],9n9qjv
e7rq55y,"> A few people on here have said that the tape is JFK and Monroe sex tape, which would explain why the FBI had Jon Hamm’s character in there, to retrieve it so the story didn’t get out... but that doesn’t explain what the deal with the hotel was, why are they spying on people and who is “management?”

It's Bobby Kennedy. I originally thought it was JFK but nobody would call JFK ""Senator"" after he died. I also thought MLK until Senator popped up too. As for the hotel, it's a spy hole set up illicitly without FBI oversight. Could be Nixon, could be Russian, we don't know because Hamm doesn't finish the job.

> Did Rose kill her father before or after she met Billy Lee? I assumed for a while that Billy Lee brainwashed her, she fell in love with him, and he convinced her to kill her father and to bring Emily along with her. However, there is that scene on the beach where Rose was wearing her father’s boots, after Billy Lee and her had just met, and it was hinted to that her father had already died. 

It's unclear if Rose had anything to do with getting away from her parents. They could have just been lost runaways or ran away after he died of something else. We do know that Rose was the target of her father's affections which is why she would choose to keep his boots in a fucked up kind of way.

> For people saying that Billy Lee had no motive for being there, he did, Emily had saw that Billy Lee was evil and ran away, but obviously Rose did not want to because she had fallen in love with Billy Lee which is why Emily had to “kidnap” her, and that’s how Hamm’s character got killed, trying to intervene on a suspected kidnapping despite being told not to intervene, he was only there on the FBI job. Anyway, Billy Lee said that Emily took away his property (Rose) and came to get it back. He knew where to come because Rose called him on the telephone without Emily’s knowledge. 

Billy Lee was there to protect himself from Emily. Rose was a part of the group that killed the family on the newscast. This is an event similar to Charles Manson and his clan and Emily was doing her best to protect her sister. Hamm got killed because he didn't understand the situation and walked into the room of a kidnapping to pistol whip the kidnapper.

> Billy Lee knowing that Daniel Flynn and the singer (I forget her name) we’re lying was strange, and I also don’t understand why he shot Emily instead of the kid or Daniel Flynn (just crazy maybe)

Preacher and Singer were outside with a gun and a case full of money. Her being a rich and famous singer doesn't sound quite right since he had no idea who she was. Also, if Singer can figure Preacher out, Billy Lee a liar and a narcissist definitely could. The only 2 people that didn't matter to him in that room was the kid who works behind the counter and the girl who stole his 2nd in command. That's why the game didn't matter. They were going to die anyway and Emily knew that.

Nick was killed by his partner. The guy who couldn't drive and the only other person who knew about the meetup. Flynn saying nobody else knew was probably true because he either killed the driver or being a criminal for 10 years will do that to a guy.",9n9qjv

Miles doesn't die. He points the gun at Rose while she's standing over Billy, she turns to rush him and then he shoots her and starts to cry. Flynn takes the gun away and Miles says ""How am I going to explain this to management.""

The rest stays the same, except Miles stays at the Hotel and is in the parking lot while it burns. Flynn and Darlene are in Reno, doing the same thing, except we see a little piece of recording equipment monitoring the venue as it fades",9n9qjv

As to the third act...
I was really expecting Father Flynn’s play to be telling Billy that there were TWO bags of cash. (Which would have both supported the partnership story and bought him time to work out an escape plan.)

The mirrors scene I knew to look out for, but a) it happens so early and b) the execution and tension of it happening in long form is so impeccable that I didn't mind not being surprised by it happening.

 I fortunately had forgotten who Bridges was talking to when he confirmed he wasn't a priest, so I at least got to be surprised that he and Erivo ended up teamed up. But I liked how subtle his not-priestness was in the first part of the film and it would've been nice to have that experience of reflecting on it and seeing how off his priest impression was.

e7nxiz4,"Agreed, first third was shaping up very nicely when Hamm went to his room and started tinkering around with the phone and investigating the hidden mirror hallway, felt like some classic noir detective stuff was in store, then shortly after he's out of the movie.

One movie poster said 'from the creator of cabin in the woods' so I was expecting tons of crazy twists throughout, nothing necessarily supernatural but tons of unexpected things that would make the beginning and end seem like completely different movies with what could have happened.  The surveillance stuff the vacuum guy finds was a great start to unraveling some bizarre history and truth of this hotel and of the other character's motives but it really just died off after the priest told the singer about the money.  Is it really my fault for expecting more when the movie mentions cabin in the woods and this was shaping up to be a whodunnit with a mindblowing reveal by the end?


I swear a brief synopsis said 7 strangers meet up at a hotel and stuff happens but it's just the original 3, then the kidnapping sister barely shows up, and I saw Hemsworth in the previews so figured he'd check in 'soon' which never happened nor did he appear until it was too late.  Movie would have been much better with more guests.",9n9qjv

e7x0dnf,I expected Lee Harvey Oswald.,9n9qjv
e7swcwx,"Thematically, I felt the movie was about choices and consequences and how they reflect who you are as a person, and the hotel was the symbolic backdrop. They are all faced with which room to choose when they check in and each has a different motivation. Those choices eventually change their lives - especially Bridges - who had to choose between two potential rooms. From there on, there are lots of binary choice situations. Does Jon Hamm get involved or ignore the kidnapping? Does Dakota Johnson kill him or leave him alive? Does Cynthia Erivo take the producers offer or not? There are lots of them. When Bridges and Erivo are in the car, he even mentions her having two choices at that juncture and then later the whole red/black roulette thing. Each choice is shown to have real consequence and to affect the story or the life of the character. ",9n9qjv

It too straddled the border between California and Nevada, as the name suggests, so perhaps they included the spiel about the state lines in the movie to overtly reference its real-world inspiration.

**Edit:** Also, regarding the importance of the state lines, I'm quoting u/kieranjackwilson from an above comment:

In fact the last thing he says is ""listen--"" but she pulls the trigger before he can explain anything.

What I found interesting was in his background, he made it very apparent that there's a choice not to play the game, and when Boots didn't play along with his ""Right/Wrong"" schtick, he called her out for giving the answer he wants, and then later, when in the hotel, he forces the game on them, which alluded to his God complex; his answer is to not play, but his power is to force people to play anyway.",9n9qjv

Billy wanted to know the source of the cash to anticipate the extent of the incoming onslot and make a decision. If it's really Darlene's, try to convince her to join the cult and take the lion's share; or just kill her. But he has to be sure.

I really did enjoy the movie as a whole but felt the story fell flat in the end. I got the sense the movie wanted to be some grand noir flick, but, ultimately, the ending did nothing to satisfy my cravings for a good mystery. Ended up just being a bunch of unique characters in a small setting with little surprise. All of the shootings/killings were fairly well telegraphed.

On the other hand, The Hateful Eight surprised me throughout. Certainly not sure its fair to even compare them but, in doing so, I think it is downright lunacy to call this the better film. 

Just my 2 cents of course.",9n9qjv

Billy Lee is the epitome of a charismatic narcissistic sociopath, we think he's weird because we only see him from Emily's perspective.

e7q5wb1,"I disagree with bits of your theory.  If “management” is the FBI, they’ve sent Hamm in with no info at all.  He figures out the secret tunnel by pacing the width of his room and realizing it left too much room, after finding another group’s wiretaps in his room.  So he didn’t know about the tunnel, or the camera, and likely neither did the FBI.  He was explicitly gathering the FBI’s wiretaps from his room (which is how he found the others), which means he was cleaning up after a previous investigation.  When Hoover tells him to gather the surveillance material, it is *after* Hamm tells him about the camera he discovered, and the other wiretaps, and Hoover assumes their investigation blown.  So Hoover probably wanted any surveillance material there to figure out who the secondary observing party was, and maybe to gather counterintelligence.  I don’t think Hamm was sent in looking for the tape, because the evidence just doesn’t back it up. 

However, I agree MLK is as likely a person to be on the tape as any other, and much more likely than most possibilities, even if it wasn’t the FBI in this case trying to gather intel on him.  It also fits with why the bellboy would protect him, and why the bellboy would specifically (and uncomfortably) point out that it’s no place for a priest.  ",9n9qjv

So she has a history of men offering her a lot of nothing only to swindle her. I think it's better she didn't see the bottle clearly and acted on impulse. 

They discuss it in the car and the priest references that she knew she was taking a gamble. He asked her, ""How'd you know "" and she says the line I opened with. Then he says and if you were wrong you'd have smashed an elderly priest with a bottle.

Myles is an unfortunate veteran working for unknown (to us) employees. Likely with ties to organized crime. Crime is a common route for damaged or plain underemployed veterans. Despite wanting to absolve his sins, he continues  sinning in order to live. Hence the heroin.

I thought that character would show up at the end, maybe knowing Bridges had been released he would follow him to the $$. Thought for sure they made it a point for him to be masked earlier so he could show up later and we wouldn't know who he was until the reveal.

e7m4s63,"I don't disagree at all, but I wonder how much of that is an issue with the movie itself vs. an issue of the expectations that maybe come with its tone?

I had a not-quite-there Tarantino vibe by the end, but I also really enjoyed the movie overall. I caught a screening a couple weeks ago, so I've had some time to digest it, and at this point, I'm not sure that's what the movie was going for.

There was definitely some commentary there that was maybe a bit on the nose, but generally well executed. Darlene felt to me like the most empowered of the characters by the end, which I saw coming a mile away, but she was portrayed so well that I was on board with it. Similarly, the anti-war sentiments that came with Miles' fucked up situation came out in such a shocking and sudden way that I felt like it really worked.

Overall, though, it felt like a fun ride to me. A bit of trope subversion, some really great visual shots, and excellent acting made it an evening really well spent, at least for me. It's not a movie I'm itching to revisit, but I had a great time with it.",9n9qjv
e7n9x6f,"Well, I dunno what you consider ""substance."" There are definitely layers, and motifs, in the film. 

The ""big idea"" of the film is about ""personas"" or who people present themselves to be to the public. Jeff Bridges character is acting from the beginning; eventually he forgets his real name, and the only identity left he has is the priest persona, and becomes a priest, in substance, for the Miles character, after pretending to be one. 

Miles, at the beginning, is summoned by a bell to perform a rehearsed ""spiel"" about the hotel whenever a new guest arrives.

Jon Hamm's character is putting on the persona as a southern salesman. 

Erivo's character's whole arch is about what it means to be a singer, for her particular, in a situation where her performances are controlled, objectified, and rendered ""boring"" by controlling men. 

Hemsworth's character is, as Erivo's character described, simply putting on a performance as a cult-leader type figure, like in the flashback, but the stuff he says makes no sense. 

The hotel itself is designed to uncover who people are, beyond their personas, by surveillance.


Maybe this theme is not especially complex, but I think it is good enough for a movie in this genre.... ",9n9qjv
e7o7qmi,"I think the movie did have something to say. Think of some of the scenes, we had Billy Jean asking people to make choices, to choose between black and white, or red and black during the roulette. We had Darlene talking about people like Billy Jean taking advantage of the weak and the lost.

Doesn't it seem like the whole movie was about the lost and the weak? Darlene had a struggling career, the priest lost his memory and was dying soon, the two sisters were victims of abuse looking for strength, and Miles was in the depths of guilty despair. 

This movie was about the lost and the weak, and the choices they make given those circumstances. ",9n9qjv
e7r24n7,"I don’t really see what exactly a film like Pulp Fiction has to say either though if you look at it that way. You could argue that a lot of films “have nothing to say” but they can still be very entertaining and well put together.

I think had there been a better producer on board who has their feet in the mystery genre storytelling (i.e. Shane Black, James Mangold, Ben Affleck) this would've turned out to be a much better film. Actually Mangold's ""Identity"" has a very similar premise to ""El Royale"" but is a much better movie, and I would've been very interested to see his how his input would've affected the film.",9n9qjv

ed3s4uz,"Late to the party, but I just saw the film and loved it, so I'm here. Looks like the Vietnam issue has been addressed, but I'll give some thoughts on the problem you have with Billy Lee. 

He insists on knowing where the money came from because it's a loose end. Doc tells him that nobody will come looking for the money, and Billy responds that there is always someone looking. It's a pretty smart move for a criminal to try to tie up all those loose ends, or to at least become aware of what the potential loose ends are so that he knows what to expect if anyone ever comes looking. So, before making off with the money, Billy wants to make sure he knows who this guy is and what the money might be tied to so he can handle it. ",9n9qjv
edrvu5c,"> The second disturbing point for me was Billy Lee insisting to know where did the money come from. I mean, why does it matter?

Cabin in the Woods was a masterpiece, while I think El Royale merely manages to be entertaining. Cabin was masterful due to its deconstruction/commentary on the horror genre (possibly Joss Whedon’s mark as co-author) while El Royale felt like it didn’t have much going on beyond the coincidental meeting of a mind-bending number of psychos.

I walked out thinking that the story was missing.... something... which I have since chalked up to a script the director thought was “close enough” to polish during shooting. I think some small tweaks could have really pushed this into the top movies of the year category, but those changes didn’t make it in. 

The trailer did an excellent job of making the characters seem like they all had very dark pasts, but the characters in the movie were not as seedy as it made them out to be. I also thought the climax and twists could have been more extreme - but maybe it was going for a realism approach? Maybe the trailer put my expectations in the wrong place. 

From a wholistic view, I loved every aspect of this movie (actors were excellent, set was fantastic, editing and post seemed crisp - including music) except for the script. The script gets a C+.

e7qc36m,"Darlene's secret being the wig was a stroke of genius IMO because in some ways, it was the biggest curveball of the movie.

Look over the secrets again and then consider what side of the line the rooms they chose were on. Hamm's secret that he's law enforcement is the first revealed, and he was insistent that he get that specific room that happened to be on the California side. It's not long afterwards that we see hints of Flynn's and Emily's secrets as well, and both of them seem sinister. Soon after, we see that Emily's kidnapping was for an altruistic reason - and remember that she initially tried for a California room before saying that she didn't give a shit. And then we see Bridges is far from being on the up and up as well, and he had immediately chosen the Nevada side.

So we've been set up to believe that the secrets these character are hiding correlate to the side they chose. Hamm was the only one to insist upon a California room, and he's the only character that we can be sure had a secret that set him firmly on the side of good to that point. The others are murky at best.

Which leaves us wondering about Darlene. She chose the Nevada side as well. She seems perfectly innocent, but how do we know for sure? We've been thrown a twist or two already.

And then it turns out that while, yes, technically she was hiding ""who she truly was"" like the rest of them, it's a completely innocuous secret. It reinforces that she was just in the complete wrong place at the wrong time, both at the El Royale in general and then the Nevada side where all hell has broken loose.

I think the guy on the film was supposed to be Robert F Kennedy. Nixon is shown on screen as president at some point and the man was described as being there ""About a year ago"" and that he was a Senator. RFK died in 1968 so that would line everything up.

Offerman even gets his gun before answering the door and waves the person in before getting shot.

And as far as the cult, I think they would have been a better character just shown only through tvs as a coming force, an agent of disruption and change and chaos.    


The hotel could have a couple, that actually turns out to be two famous actors having an affair.  Then instead of being after the girl, the cult shows up to kill the couple, and just stumbles upon the girl and the money.

Dakota kidnapped her sister and they ran from the cult led by Billy Lee (Hemsworth), who ordered Rose to commit those murders in Malibu (and desensitized her to violence by making her participate in ""tussles,"" which also groomed her sexually into doing what he asked of her).

Hamm was obviously an FBI agent that was working to take down this specific one and its management for good. And we don’t see/hear any more of the management of the hotel because they’re not relevant to the immediate story and are probably almost entirely gone since this hotel is now being run by a single boy. This setting is merely a backdrop for what DOES occur; the hotel isn’t the core of the film, the characters are. 

Each of these stories are in their respective final acts, but by putting them in the same confined location, they all overlap and play off of each other into a massive clusterfuck shitstorm. And I honestly thought there were plenty of amazing jaw-dropping twists and turns; Hamm being an FBI agent and the slow-burn tense buildup of uneasiness throughout the first act as he uncovers all the wires in his room and investigated the hotel; Johnson’s character dragging a body into her room and the slow reveal of her past; the Priest getting that unexpected bottle to the face and the reveal of his past, and so on.

My personal theory is that she was already suspicious and tested Flynn a little bit during their conversations, specifically by naming off fake hymns, and when he didn't spot the fakes she knew he was sketchy. Also, Flynn is VERY sloppy-looking for a Catholic priest in any era. Most of them don't have long, greasy hair and unkempt beards.

My comment further up on the same question. It's subtle, but it's there. and fits the films morality for me. Her hitting a potentially innocent man is the wrong action at the right time. It calls into question good and evil and as Billy puts it ""Playing the game... do you wanna be right or wrong"".   
The point Billy makes is that it's not really a choice.   
So Darlene does what she has to willing to accept either outcome. 

As the priest at the end affirms when he not a priest assumes the role to do the right thing, but as the wrong person. Or the weird morality of the FBI who choose to leave the girl to protect the image of man. Cause his image as good is worth more than the reality of who he was.        

Darlene making the questionable call is way more in line with the film than actually defending herself with full knowledge.

The owners of the hotel was Hoover and his men who used it to record and blackmail their opposition, including whoever was on the recording they threw in the fire at the end, presumably MLK

Billy Lee also talks about owning 'his' legacy while leering at Darlene.

Remember that Laramie calls Director Hoover *himself* directly from the payphone outside. Hoover and the Kennedy's were famous for not getting along, but he particularly hated RFK. At the end, Rose/Boots (I think it was her, right?) asks why the tape is so valuable even though the man on it is dead. The response is that sometimes a man's reputation is more important than the man himself. Laramie's only mission was to get that tape for Hoover.  


<EDIT> If it is RFK, then the woman on the tape could have been Marilyn. RFK also had an affair with her too (allegedly). However, I don't think it's her.

Then this guy who seemed like a cop burst into the room and her sister was a murderer?

It was a cult and their got off on playing god, that’s why they took the other people hostage so Billy Lee could spew more bullshit to his follows and get off on them doing whatever the fuck he tells them. The only thing the kid was trying to forget was how he killed 100+ people so makes sense he wouldn’t start talking about guns. He was using heroine to numb himself of those memories. Maybe the writers were trying to stick to the theme of the movie that many people all have stories and his happened to be he was a sniper. It was actually a relief to me that for once in a movie the psycho murders picked the wrong one to fuck with. They picked a guy that was actually a trained killer and they paid for it.

Sometimes people come up with ideas and they’re bad plans he was an old crook and he had a bad plan. He was some crime mastermind. It seemed pretty clear him and his brother only knew about hiding the money, so whoever killed his brother had no clue where it was.

As for Robert, he was the family man. The calm, collected, wise beyond his years brother of the wild and ambitious John.

If you make the FBI obvious bad guys in this movie, you instantly take away the aspect of how grounded this movie is.

It's either someone as inconsequential to the story proper as naming the film is; meaning, it's an agent of ""god"" that sets events in motion.

Or it could be the only person who knew that there was a bank robbery full of money somewhere. Someone who knew what was going on. The third robber.

The whole first scene is from the vantage of the mirror, so what do you want to bet it was Miles' predecessor who waited throughout the entirety of the room reconstruction before killing the crook (although why not take the money? unless it's an agent of the Management).

It's unlikely O'Kelly killed his brother only to return after prison to retrieve the loot, but plausible. 

I thought I saw the briefest of a CGI-young Hamm walking through a Flynn flashback, but I think that's coincidence.

Ultimately, I personally think it was Management itself. Watched through the mirror and didn't take the money because the events of this movie would provide a proper resolution over the soldier's soul as decided by the innocent singer.",9n9qjv

e7mkrgj,"Yeah it was somewhat all over the place.

I could be wrong, but I don’t think Darlene ever saw who was on the tape, she was just using all of those examples to refer to Lee. 

My guess to JFK is that they mentioned it was a kind senator that had a women in his room but Mile’s lied and said he didn’t. 

If I were to go full conspiracy I’d say they were referring to or at least pointing in the direction of JFK & Marilyn Monroe being on the tape due to the known secretive history behind their whole affair, the lack of proof, and the fact they had a picture together on the wall at the beginning of the film when looking back at all of the popular people that had stayed there.

Like what did Billy mean by asking Rose 'did you tell them what you did' then there was some sort of flashback to a kid - and did Emily burn her fathers body? did the father even die or am I just imagining that? My thought was that Rose was a psychopath, but she hadnt acted upon it till billy came into the picture but am I just reaching there? Anyways if someone can tell me what the flashbacks with Emily and the fire are and also what Rose 'did' that would be awesome. ",9n9qjv
e7wzcir,"The bellboy says he kept the tape because the 'Senator' who's on it was nice to him. That nixes MLK and certainly nixes Eisenhower as Eisenhower was never a Senator. It also credibly nixes JFK because JFK was elected president in 1960, which is about ten years prior to film's setting, when the bellboy would've been about 13 or 14. 

RFK was not a known philanderer in the late 60's or early 70's and would've only been killed within the last year or two, at which point his reputation would've been that of a martyr and it would have been heavily damaged by such a tape.

JFK died in 1963. Are we to think Miles was working at the El Royale way back before 1963? And probably before 1961, too, as no sitting president would likely have stayed at El Royale. 

So for it to be JFK we’d need a VERY young Miles working at El Royale, already for “Management.” Several years go by, he goes to Vietnam for at least 1 year, comes back, starts working at the El Royale again, then between 0 and at most 2 years go by before the events of the film.

The line splitting the property down the middle showcases this and the fact that they all get rooms on Nevada side (bad) to start. They start off in small little pockets (similar to their rooms) until John Hamm makes a choice and forces everyone to make a choice. 

Flynn has to choose whether to work with Sweet. He chooses evil to drug her. She chooses to attack him and flee. They reconcile in the parking lot near the divide to work together.

Emily kills Hamm. Rose calls Billy Lee. This is in their room on the evil side. She wounds Miles but chooses to let him live and brings him to the lobby in the center. 

Miles walks between good and bad by trying to confess his sins to absolve himself while also shooting heroin.

Darlene's the best because she never has been to the evil side. She's never left California. One afternoon in Nevada and she's cracking bottles over peoples heads and plotting to kill them. The car she chose to not shoot Flynn in was on the California side.

Then Billy Lee comes waltzing in with his posse and tells each of these people that there is a choice. Red or Black. Good or evil. However we have seen his version of good or evil. It's just evil. That's why he is shot always facing the group on the evil side in the hotel.",9n9qjv

Sweet was clearly planning on beaning the guy given her consideration to slip off her shoes so she could run at him without being heard. This detail is important because nothing we're shown in the character's background suggests that she has the capacity for such premeditated violence.  

Some of my other points, particularly relating to Miles, also make wonder if there was some other plot the movie was setting up, but that was ultimately changed.  It might have just been the marketing, but I really thought this was going to be some Huis Clos/No Exit type situation, and all the characters were dangerous, murderous individuals (all of them except Erivo's and arguably Hamm's ended up being so).",9n9qjv
e7uo3et,"This is a scene i wish could have been longer. I think the director could have really tied the suspicion down by doing research on the differences between aspects of baptists and catholics. Darlene is a devout churchgoer, flynn is not. There were some good details that could have foreshadowed her suspicion more. She was obviously suspicious but if during that scene, the camera could have panned to her slipping out of her shoes in a wide shot, it would have really brought it home. Instead, we get the scene of her shoes off in a shot after, to show she is suspicious. ",9n9qjv
e7sc7oc,"All of the points I raised were meant to be illustrations of why the plot is so bad, but to add some color to that: there are a lot of cool stories/ideas floating around in this movie, but they're never tied cohesively together.  Its as if the director came up with too many ""good"" ideas (any one of the three main plots could have been a story by itself) and just said we'll use them all.  I find it so frustrating because each of the plots has a nice hook to them and is cast very well (except Hemsworth), so it's a shame to get half-baked versions of them rather than a single great version of one.  Alternatively, the movie could've tried to tie all the plot threads into some overarching narrative or plot element, suggesting that these cool storylines aren't meant to be fully fleshed out, but to serve some greater purpose/point.

I would argue that RFK not having the reputation JFK has for sleeping around makes the tape all the more likely to be his; a JFK tape would be... something.... but it wouldn't be necessarily reputation destroying, as him getting around was an open secret. As for Robert, he was the family man. The calm, collected, wise beyond his years brother of the wild and ambitious John.

The only hole in the above theory is that ""Father Flynn"" mentions to Darlene that the plan was to bury the money under the floor (I think -- because how else would he have known this?) .... but it's possible that the backstabbing ""kid"" was not privy to this plan between Jeff Bridges and Nick Offerman.",9n9qjv

The hotel worker mentions senators that used to stay at the hotel, but never says the person on the film was a senator (only that he was ""kind"" to him.)  It's assuredly not JFK though, because the movie takes place in 1969 (officially, from what I can tell, though Nixon's speech playing on the television at one point is from 1970,) and the hotel worker specifically says the tape is from a year before (1968.) JFK died in 1963.  Therefore, if it's meant to be any real-life famous person at all, it would have to be MLK or Bobby Kennedy (both assassinated in 1968.)

&#x200B;

I feel like MLK is a better bet since a) the little girl recognized him on the film, and it seems like he would be more recognizable than Kennedy; b) information has since come to light that Hoover and the FBI spent an extensive amount of resources at the time investigating and trying to neutralize MLK; and c) they said the worth of the tape was that it alters the ""ideal of the man"" (or something to that effect,) and I feel like back then tarnishing MLK's reputation would have had a much greater impact than tarnishing Bobby Kennedy's reputation.",9n9qjv

ed3hv7p,"I think it's probably JFK, if for no other reason than I just associate JFK with Tahoe more than I do MLK. 

The El Royale is based off the Cal Neva Lodge and Casino, which JFK and Bobby both spent time at and  was partially owned by their friend Frank Sinatra (the resort actually has a really fascinating history if you want to google around a bit). One of the legends associated with the resort is that JFK and Marilyn Monroe had various trysts there, and the film made a point of establishing that Monroe had stayed at the El Royale. 

I don't necessarily think the Senator anecdote is intended to be about JFK, but it definitely is intended to draw our attention to the fact that powerful political figures frequented the hotel. 

Your point about the FBI is interesting. However, the sense I got was that this surveillance system was established, not to target someone specific, but to gather dirt on powerful figures, knowing that this was a resort that attracted various elites. So, it's possible that even if the FBI wasn't specifically targeting JFK in the film, they nonetheless instructed Miles to record JFK's indiscretions when they discovered he was staying there. Also, was it definitively established that the FBI was doing the surveillance? I kind of remember Miles' handlers being left somewhat ambiguous, but I may have missed it, there was a lot going on.

e85z9em,">How army guy got a mystery sniper rifle 

The film kinda showed the rifle in multiple shots *before* the 'army guy' (he's named Miles Miller btw) took hold of the gun. He took the rifle from one of the 'bad guys' (don't know if they had names) after he shot them with the handgun, which was clearly next to him. Just because you weren't paying attention to the scenes doesn't make Miles getting another weapon a ""Giant coincidence"".

>and felt like killing all the bad guys after he spent likev30 minutes crying about not wanting to kill anymore while staring feverishly at a hand gun.

He had no other choice. Also, he spent a minute max ""he spent likev30 minutes crying about not wanting to kill anymore while staring feverishly at a hand gun"". You exaggerated that part for seemingly no reason. Did the flashback confuse you? (just asking coz maybe that's why you were confused about how long he stared at the gun for). 

>How the secret agent guy and his secret agency knew there was a tape there to find, when the tapes were already sent off to another destination which they would have had a better time investigating. (The only reason why there was a tape there to begin with was because some guy was nice to the bell boy one time, otherwise there would be nothing to find.)

As u/sirjonsnow said, the FBI agent knew nothing about the tape. The agent also knew nothing about the see-through mirrors and how there was tape there. In fact, I don't think we ever learn why he was originally there- we just knew that his 'mission' may be comprised if he didn't remove all the bugs and film equipment in the hotel AFTER he found the secret room and bugging.

>Giant coincidences like that, that should not be the support for major plot points.

They weren't coincidences! You just didn't pay attention! Miles grabbed the sniper rifle from the 'goon' he killed with the hand gun, and that goon had been holding the rifle for a while. The FBI agent didn't know about the filming or anything like that, it's just that the discovery of those things made him and his superiors WORRY that their mission was going to be compromised. That mission was not revealed to the audience btw, so I can kinda get why your mind couldn't wrap around what happened. Maybe rewatch the movie again?

>also did not like the priests convenient Alzheimers.

That factored into the story in many different ways. It was also a part of his character arc/development. I guess I can see why you call it 'convenient', but I'm fine with it. It was hinted at/set up very early on in the film, it was consistent, it was essential to the story and it allowed for character arcs to be developed.

>Also conveniently fast bad guy is conveniently fast.

You mean Billy Lee? You might have a point, but it was never established how far away they were. They could have been quite close. Yeah, I can see why you think it was convenient. However, it was a great moment when Billy Lee and his 'goons' showed up when Rose (I think that's her name) was hinting that Billy Lee was coming.

Each character in that movie was lost. Darlene had a career going nowhere, Flynn was losing his memories and his actions had no purpose (he had no time anyways), Rosie and her sister were the weak abused.

Miles was present for the conversation between the sisters, he knows Rose called Billy Lee, and clearly all of them are aware that she's obsessively brainwashed and didn't react at all to her sister's death, which are all pretty major red flags in a situation like that.

I think it's just an event that requires some suspension of disbelief, and it's something the audience almost definitely sees coming in a movie that otherwise keeps you guessing pretty effectively up to that point, which makes it stand out a bit to me.",9n9qjv

I thought it was pretty clear this is exactly what happened, otherwise they wouldn't bother having the 3rd ""new guy"" and that bit of dialogue about whether they could trust him, whether he was crooked or just dumb.

>""Father Flynn"" mentions to Darlene that the plan was to bury the money under the floor (I think -- because how else would he have known this?) .... but it's possible that the backstabbing ""kid"" was not privy to this plan between Jeff Bridges and Nick Offerman

re: handlers, I do think Miles handlers are separate from the FBI surveillance and yes, they were absolutely ambiguous. I did think of Watergate/Nixon type of 'general political espionage' when he first brought it up. The FBI surveillance was from Jon Hamm's character and separate from Miles handlers and I surmised that perhaps he/they had been surveilling the hotel because they know MLK had been staying there (presumably from following him) and he was *specifically* looking for dirt on MLK that Miles had inadvertently stumbled on while just doing general espionage.",9n9qjv

Not only that he was not a legendary adulterer with all these whispers about him, that was Jack, so to have proof that he was screwing around would be massive.  

Jack was allegedly a fan of affairs, while Marilyn is his most famous it is far from his only, assuming the tape would be Jack and Marilyn is a foolish assumption and the fact it is not her is a foolish reason to say it can't be Jack.

I was telling my friend that it seemed too long and too short at the same time. I think it would've made a great miniseries.",9n9qjv

e7rjp1e,What are you implying is a red herring? ,9n9qjv
e7to6w9,"Yeah, the one piece I can't reconcile is what MLK would be doing in Tahoe, CA.  RFK makes more sense in that regard.",9n9qjv

e7skwra,"I know Rose said the person was dead, and he loved to talk, I don't remember exactly if she said senator, I feel she's young enough to recognize the face from TV, but not know the specifics on the person.  I definitely want to see it again and see if I can piece more things together.  

Ultimately though, as the priest said, does it matter?",9n9qjv

e7pyff0,"I considered that after I read your initial response to what I said. However, I think Miles believed right up until the roulette game that Flynn was actually a priest, which I doubt would be the case if he recognized him. I could be way off base though.

Mind sharing your possible other theories even without the subsequent viewing? No worries if so; I’m just curious. ",9n9qjv
edji1d6,"Could be Russian bugs, CIA bugs, hotel bugs... the point is that we were left guessing because of shitty writing. ",9n9qjv
efoz4uu,"Just watched it. Father Flynn kept asking Miles if he ever kept footage instead of turning it over to ‘Management.’ After much prying, miles finally says “well, there was one. A senator from back east...blah blah blah...” and then he said “but he was kind to me. Nobody is ever kind to me. I just told them he was alone in his room.” This is him saying that he recorded the night in the room, but then since the senator was kind to him, he ultimately decided to lie to ‘Management’ instead. Given that this was his response after endless prying of “did you ever keep any tapes.” It’s pretty much a for sure that the film was of Th Senator and the woman he spent the night with.",9n9qjv

e7uth7b,"""Avid fan of history"" lol

Straw man argument - never said Bobby was as big as jfk. You just invented that. You did that to change the argument to one you could win. 

My argument wasn't that Bobby was as big as jfk. My argument is that the facts suggest it was Bobby not jfk. 

You offered NOTHING to rebut or discredit my claim. 

Time to go to bed. ",9n9qjv

e92u12i,"Maybe. I just didn't buy it, but I can't really say I am familiar with the particulars of the Manson cult, so maybe it was true to form.",9n9qjv

ecxh81i,"1969
",9n9qjv
edjqvla,I guess it could be. Idk. There's enough real historical figures in the movie that I feel like it being RFK is more plausible.,9n9qjv
e85qls8,"Miles also said that the man was a visitor in the past few years. I’m almost certain he said last year, but it may have been 2-3 years, from what others have said. That’s the same way I saw the Senator situation, but I heard some other people saying that Miles said it was a senator that was nice to him that he kept the tape of. 

Also, I think the movie actually takes place in 1970, rather than 1969. The speech that Nixon was giving on the TV near the beginning about Nam, was dated on October 7th, 1970. ",9n9qjv
e7q7mz0,"Definitely, yeah, though I don’t know if the dates would line up with the movie’s timeline.  MLK is probably my top guess, but RFK is certainly a plausible candidate as well.  ",9n9qjv
ejx2b7v,"…and the film was supposed to destroy the ""good guy"" image of the person represented, so RFK is plausible.",9n9qjv
e8ko5hf,"Another person who was famous that died in 1968 was Martin Luther King Jr. The FBI were working to find proof of a rumor they started, namely that MLK had multiple alleged affairs so this could be him too. The alleged evidence came from the FBI and we had an FBI agent come into this movie and making the El Royale look like an FBI outpost, at least to me. So to me it could be Robert Kennedy or MLK and it would make sense either way. There is likely more people it could be but who knows.",9n9qjv
e8u6vl2,"Corrected, thanks.",9n9qjv
ed31taq,"No, she didn't agree to his blackmail, which is why she was doing a gig in Reno, exactly like he threatened if she didn't comply.  Several characters pointed out that the film had someone famous and prominent on it who was now dead.",9n9qjv

ed27mlb,"Why did you put her character's name in quotes? That was her actual name. 

Also, what are you talking about???",9n9qjv
e82fwuf,True true. I guess it does add something to the secret and cinematic nature of the film. That much I can definitely appreciate and understand. ,9n9qjv
e7sfrqx,"I've heard some people mention that, but I totally don't remember that line about it being ""last year"" for him. I need to see it again I guess!",9n9qjv
e7s4mt7,Thanks for clearing that all up for me guys. ,9n9qjv
e7uj9e5,I agree because it feels like it breaks alot of filmmaking rules with regards to intuitiveness there has to have been deleted pages/scenes. Even Jeff Bridges was in an interview saying he doesn't know what the hell is going on when he watched it.,9n9qjv

e7vv12y,"I understand. I picked up on that when watching, it was pretty obvious. Tthat doesn't excuse the pretty bad exposition of the film on the kid killer. There's allegory,  and there's saying ""This girl is creepy and is a murderer like the manson family"" like 3-4 times, which i feel the film did. ",9n9qjv
e7tp1cw,"Apparently mlk gave a speech in the Bay Area in 1967 so if he traveled by bus he could have gone through that area if he went towards Salt Lake City. It wouldn’t be too much of a trip to Tahoe from San Fran. 

I could he going there to gamble and keep a lower profile than the middle of Reno?

e8kzsvb,">film

I just watched the film this afternoon. I instantly thought it was MLK after the character Darlene dismissed the role of film as a preacher who ultimately decides who to f\*\*\* without her ever looking who's in it. A majority thinks it was Robert Kennedy. But it would make sense if it was MLK. Definite emphasis on burning the film if it was him.

&#x200B;

I respect Goddard keeping the film ambiguous so that the audience never really knows who was in that film role.",9n9qjv
e82i7l4,"That's not to say Hamm's character was flawless in that regard. As a trained agent (people are saying CIA, I thought he was FBI), he failed to secure the suspect.

I know we as the audience saw the shotgun eariler but Hamm's character kept not seeing it. That we saw it again later like this makes it a textbook ""Chekhov's Gun"" more literally.",9n9qjv

e7tuu2u,"I could see it. 

Still, I'm impressed to see how much historical thought went into this one-off thriller to keep us guessing this much.",9n9qjv
e7qgucp,"You need to watch the movie again, none of that makes any sense within the context of the movie. Miles had no way of knowing the money was there unless Management told him for some reason. ",9n9qjv
ee11wls,"Yes-but they specifically said that the tape had been made “last year,” and as an avid fan of history you know when JFK died and that the timeline doesn’t match. ",9n9qjv
e7w371q,"Right, but whether they know he's coming or not beforehand doesn't have any bearing on the handling of the situation at the end of the movie.

I'm specifically talking about Miles assessing the situation with Rose (at the end of the movie), at which point he had that information.",9n9qjv
e8dyuj4,I love that. A movie that has us debating something like this a week after its release,9n9qjv
e7nm2k5,Let me know what you think about it. I hope my opinion of it doesn’t affect yours. I’m sorry if it does. Hmu after you see it. Let me know what you think,9n9qjv
e7u5kk2,i probably spent longer reading and looking up RFK and MLK and nixon than i did watching the movie. I tried to find that clip with nixon talking about guerilla warfare. I agree i like the mystery of it,9n9qjv
