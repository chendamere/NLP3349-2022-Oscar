f8ur35o,"The best part of the movie is probably the end of the car chase when Marta gets away just by the skin of her teeth and the police cars have seemingly been trapped by debris or other things, and then we spend what feels like a full damn minute in the car with Marta and Ransom talking, and I’m thinking “Hurry! This is ridiculous if the cops don’t catch up!” and right as I’m thinking that, Blanc knocks on the car window with the rest of the fuzz pulling up behind him. So great",e21a17

I called the medicine twist fairly early, but I honestly considered that he may have switched the bottles himself when he knocked the game board on the floor. Possibly as a test to see if Marta was as honest and trustworthy as he believed.

Thankfully, what we got was much better than any half ass twist I could come up with.",e21a17

f91185d,"My thoughts:

* Marta is a great main character. The quirk of her vomiting if she tells a lie is a great obstacle to throw at her and it does a good job of informing her character. My one issue with her character is that I wished we had spent more time with her family to give me some connection to them.

* The twist that Marta was the one who “murdered” Harlan would have been fantastic on it’s own, but combined with the twist that Ransom sabotaged her made me like it even more. I stopped considering the movie to be a murder mystery so I stopped speculating about the circumstances surrounding Harlan’s death and didn't think about how suspicious Ransom was. 

* I loved Thormberry family. The little interactions that reveal that they don’t actually care about Marta (not knowing what country she is from, all of them saying they wanted her at the funeral but that they got outvoted, Don handing her a plate that he was done with to take away) were perfect and I like the fact that their political affiliations didn’t stop them from being awful. Like Meg, who is the pinnacle of the ultra liberal Trump hating college student, is willing to blackmail her friend with getting her mom deported once her personal situation is threatened. I feel like Jacob was underutilized, but I think that with a cast this big someone was bound to get the short end of the stick. 

* Daniel Craig was fantastic, mostly because of his absolutely ridiculous accent.

* The humor was fantastic. The donut analogy and Ransom stabbing Marta with the fake knife, pulling it out and then slowly pushing it into her again were particularly hilarious gags that had the entire audience laughing their ass off, but even the minor gags like Blanc getting jumpscared by the grandma staring out the window were great as well.",e21a17

f8ws15d,"I knew something was up with Chris Evans as soon as we first see him, because the dogs start barking at him. I mean obviously he's fishy but I knew there was always going to be another twist involving him. Earlier in the movie they mention that the dogs don't bark at Marta because they like/know her, and they don't bark at pretty much anyone else in the family. We hear dogs barking at one point on the night of the murder, and Blanc says at one point that dogs are a good judge of character. I know this is all super obvious stuff but... Yeah. I didn't call the twists, but I wasn't surprised when he ended up being the true villain.",e21a17

f8v17h8,The theme of ‘building something from the ground up’ and the parallel American obsession with ‘old money’ (‘our birthright’) was so deftly done.

Early on, Linda says that Harlan found the easiest part of writing his novels was the plots, apparently they just popped into his head effortlessly.  Then, when he realizes Marta is in real trouble, he comes up with an airtight plan to get her out of it within two minutes.

Then at the end when all is revealed, we see that Ransom managed to come up with a complex scheme relatively quickly himself, and was able to adjust it on the fly as the wrenches starting flying in.  Earlier, Harlan mused that of all his family, Ransom was probably the most like him, and given how clever he was, that turned out to be true.

Just a neat little detail that I appreciated.",e21a17

f8ux5tk,"Enjoyed this one quite thoroughly. Some rapid fire thoughts:

Marta's quirk of throwing up when she lies was hilarious and a fun story-telling technique throughout

Evans is infectiously charismatic. I think my favorite scene in the movie was him showing up early for the will reading and being a straight up asshole. ""You eat shit, you eat shit, you *definitely* eat shit""

I'm glad that this movie had a strong running message pertaining to contemporary political culture and didn't shy away from the family's hypocrisy

The ""reveal"" of Marta as the killer so early in the movie was intriguing and a cool direction for the genre. Managed to actually misdirect me for awhile, as I began to think the rest of the whole movie would be about her subtly sabotaging the investigation to avoid suspicion",e21a17

This wasn't mentioned in the movie but I wondered if Ransom messed with Martha's car after the will reading (which is why it wouldn't start) and he was ready to pick her up to escape. I'm not sure if that was suppose to be obvious to the viewer, or did we have to assume she just had a shitty car.

It was also amusing to see Chris Evans as a villain for once. The last scene where he realized the knife was fake had my theater laughing out of their seats.

Rich conservatives: the son in law is seen arguing in support of Donald Trump and says that “some immigrants came here the right way” and then immediately handing Marta a plate even though she isn’t a housekeeper. Reveals what he really thinks of people like her.

Rich liberals: Joni is supposed to be a woke lifestyle guru and her daughter is described as a “SJW”. Yet the daughter is the one who tells the family that Marta illegally immigrated. Just goes to show that the rich will put on appearances and posture towards all these social causes but when helping others is a risk to them they will abandon their goodwill immediately.",e21a17

He shoves Toni Collette, Walter, and Cheating Dad's motivations right in our faces and we're like ""nah it's none of them, too obvious"" completely missing the fact that they paid as little attention as possible to Ransom's equally-concerning motives. That ""I was driving home realizing I was on my own, and finally felt free"" line was excellent misdirection.

Also Hugh Ransom, *huge ransom* What??

Revealing the truth of the death really early was a pretty bold move and changed everything about how we approached the movie.

Daniel Craig was a lot of fun, seemed like he was really channeling Kevin Spacey in House of Cards.

All the modern political commentary inserted via the two kids was interesting too, I can't think of another recent movie that mentions internet culture, SJWs and the alt-right like that, but it probably is overdue.

f9fgbij,"I loved every minute of this movie. 

MY personal theory is that Blanc was completely genuine when he said he knew it was Marta the moment he laid eyes on her. It wasn’t the tiny blood spatter, though. 

It was because he read the “murder method” notes Harlan scribbled down as she frantically searched for the antidote and then, in his haste to get her out safely and take his own life, left out in the open in the study. 

Essentially, Blanc knew what went down the entire time. He brought Marta along on the “investigation” with him for one reason....She was the one who was going to lead him to solve the **real** mystery at the heart of this whole thing. 

*Who hired him?*

He ended up solving two mysteries in one, but the unnamed client was the real prize. 

I am NOT a fan of the “Marta was the mastermind” theory. It’s contrived, it’s got no legs and it makes the whole move seem cheap.

You always expect a twist, and I legitimately thought Marta being the one who “murdered” Harlan was the only one. I didn’t expect it to go as far as it did. The mechanic of her vomiting whenever she lied was also really fun, and made me smile like a madman when it was revealed. Such a creative character trait to have in a murder mystery film.

He must genuinely love the southern accent cause he did it in Lucky Louie as well!

Johnson threaded the needle pretty well through the political discourse. Never pushing it too far and not praising any side but still finding the topic of privilege and really going for it. While still keeping the movie sooo fun.",e21a17
f9jspw2,"I wanted this to be my favorite movie of the year, but I was out-voted.",e21a17
f8uadu7,"Wow, okay first of all this was great. I loved Brick so I had faith that Johnson could do a modern genre film really well and unique, but sometimes when you see a cast like this in something original it has a too good to be true feeling. But this is both too good and true. I was surprised by just about every twist for the full run time and I believe the ending is perfect, and that's usually where these whodunnits and genre films hit a wall.

First thing I noticed is how modern this is. It's definitely got that Agatha Christie feel to it and taking place in a huge mansion it definitely could have been anachronistic or set in another time, but between referencing Juuls, SJWs, and Nazi trolls this actually felt very uniquely of our time. It's a movie that doesn't just say late 2010's, but 2019 specifically and I think that's awesome.

It was so clever to solve the bulk of the mystery for us in the first act, you know? Because if it was a guessing game the whole movie there's only like five real suspects and bouncing between them could have gotten old. Right off the bat we are told these are these events of the night and this is how he died. There was still a mystery to solve, such as who else knows and will Blanc figure it out, but it became a very unique whodunnit because we knew who did it.

Or did we? I thought the final act was perfect. The movie lulls us into thinking we know what's going on better than anyone else in the movie, yet we still get that final reveal and the scene where the detective solves it all. And what's so great is that in mystery stories they tend to make everyone a suspect then just pick one for a hidden reason. What's great here is that everything is available to us and the person behind it all makes perfect sense. Here's a list of why:

- It's mentioned a lot that Harlan and Ransom are very alike and have their own way of communicating, and they both love drama. Only Ransom could have put this plot together because he's the only one who thinks like the mastermind. 

- Think of the board game. Why was that so important to Harlan? Perhaps because it's a parallel to who's ahead of the game. So while Harlan and Ransom are quite good at these games, Marta plays ""to make beautiful patterns."" Her innocence is her best tool and Harlan recognized that. 

-  Ransom vs Harlan is the only fight we never got to see happen. We saw Walt, Richard and Joni's arguments with him and knew what they were about, then the movie leads us to believe we knew what happened in Ransom's argument but we never got the full story until the end. 

- Ransom was the biggest piece of shit. Sure, Richard was a cheater, Walt was greedy, and Joni was dumb, but none of them were murderers. From the second Ransom is on screen he feels like he knows more than everyone else and he's the actual black sheep of the family. And in that same respect, we as an audience want to like him because he's charming and since he's the one everyone hates we want to assume it's not him because that would be ""too easy"".

So, when comparing it to similar movies who will give you a red herring as a douchey character, this movie makes the red herring the ""truth"" of the death. De Armas is the red herring and she didn't even know. Kinda brilliant. 

Daniel Craig is incredible. He's having fun, and I loved how we were never sure if he was amazing or terrible at what he did. He was obviously smart, but the big question was is he taking the nurse for a ride or vice versa? Did he make a bad judgement call by immediately trusting the nurse? De Armas also kills it in this movie, she definitely comes out as the main character and the tightrope she walks the entire movie of trying to evade Blanc but also dealing with the pressures of the whole family is super impressive. I would watch 100 movies starring Craig as Blanc, but I think she was the real standout in this movie.

Really my only criticism was that I wish the younger characters, the rich internet troll and the liberal college girl, were more important. They had their roles in the story, but they were never suspects and their actions that night were only important in the context of others. But also everyone who was important was really well done. Little things like when Richard absent mindedly handed his empty plate to Marta while arguing immigration. 

Beyond that, it's really fucking impressive to make a type of movie that's been made a thousand times before and make it modern and surprising and as tightly written as this. Easy 9/10, my top recommendation for the holiday weekend, and I can't wait to rewatch it. This is a full donut with no donut hole missing in the center.

Edit: also, I haven't seen a lot of people mention the kind-of-running Hallmark Channel movie gag. That was so perfectly dumb. I loved the junior detective being all about that after Marta relays Fran talking about it.

f9l9zzj,"I really loved the second act when it basically turned into an anti-whodunit. We already know who the (albeit innocent ultimately) culprit is but we like them and are rooting for them and so we're rooting against the detective character. We want the clues destroyed, we don't want the mystery solved for anyone else because it's going to ruin the culprit's life.

The will twist was genius because now the family hope to pin the murder on the 'innocent' maid so that they can claim the inheritance, unbeknownst to them the maid is the one who actually committed the apparent crime. I wish that there was more time spent on the family conspiring to try and frame her as the murderer because that would have been funny. 

Such an enjoyable film, Ana de Armas played the sweet, caring maid so well; a vital role as the emotional heart of the story so it was crucial that her character was likeable and endearing. Daniel Craig was a blast to watch and was smart to keep his character grounded enough to not be completely cartoonish. Chris Evans was perfectly cast to play the entitled, psychopathic rich kid although I kind of wish he didn't turn out to be the villain as I enjoyed him being an ally to Marta, it made him more nuanced.

It was funny, the plot was intriguing enough to keep my attention right to the end and it has great re-watch value. I haven't really been impressed with this year of film yet but Knives Out is easily my favourite of the year so far.",e21a17

I love how the Thrombey house is built like a Rube Goldberg-machine to highlight just how ridiculously convoluted American society has become. The patriarch sitting upstairs, removed from everyone, as the boomer generation has taken over the rest of the house was just *mwah*.

Then there's the obvious Trump/MAGA criticism, but even more fun is watching how Johnson flat out points the finger at boomers for allowing their children to just continue this bullshit by feigning ignorance at the internet. I thought Ben Shapiro was great in his part as the Nazi child. 

Then the whole rise of the working class angle, where the immigrant literally rises over the squabbling elite as they loudly implode over their own hubris and ego. I love that it wasn't enough for Johnson just to write a great throwback mystery, he also wanted to have a discussion about what makes these mystery stories so evocative and timeless, and then on top of that another discussion about where we are as America today.

So Ransom jumping to the deep-fried Southern joke makes no sense, except Ransom knows *exactly* who Blanc is, since he hired him. And he has good reason to imply that a) he doesn't know Blanc and b) he doesn't much like him, since eventually the question of ""who hired Blanc"" is going to come up. He probably already had the CSI:KFC line ready to go, to deflect suspicion, and used it as soon as he saw Blanc.!<",e21a17
fa57bri,"Random snippets of thought:

- Daniel Craig was really going all out with that southern accent.  If this movie was more serious I think it would have come off as too cartoonish, but given the tone of the movie, the other colorful characters, and that someone even points out that he sounds like Foghorn Leghorn it ends up working well.

- Thought Ana De Armas played her role wonderfully.  I didn't expect the twist of the mystery going from ""who killed the suspect"" to ""how is the killer going to get away with it"" and that I would be rooting for the killer (or who we thought was the killer until the end) to not get caught.  For those twists to work De Armas had to come off very likable, innocent, and completely out of her element and she pulled all three off.  I might be biased though, since she is my dream wife and all you motherfuckers need to back off.  I loved the shot where Marta finds out that she inherited everything and is trying to leave the house while the family swarms her.  The handheld close-up shot perfectly captured the metaphorical claustrophobia that she was experiencing.  Also thought the running joke of the family not knowing get home country was funny.

- I know people complain about Ransom being the killer as being too obvious, but I thought it worked out due to the aforementioned twist.  A more cliched movie would have stuck with the Clue-formula of ""whodunnit?"".  Throughout this movie though you're trying to figure out how can Marta get away with the murder and keep the money.  Maybe everyone figured out it was Ransom who was behind hiring Blanc since ""killer hiring the detective"" is a common trope, but it went completely over my head until the reveal at the end.

- I'm confused about some of the specifics of what the housekeeper knew in regards to Ransom and the murder.  So she sees that he's messing around with Marta's medical bag.  After the death she is able to get the toxicology report, which should say that Harlan's bloodworm came out normal.  So how can she use that to blackmail Ransom if what she originally thought was ""Ransom is trying to kill Harlan by messing around with his medication?",e21a17

For example, during the interview scenes, the camera zooms in on the actors when we're getting close to the truth, and it zooms back out when they start making up lies. Daniel Craig leans into the camera when he's in on something.  

Another thing I noticed is how the movie feels ageless when in the mansion (it could be a Holmes or Marple movie) but contrasts it strongly with Marta's flat and the ""outside"" world.

Also, small thing that would have no impact: that blood spat on her shoe, no fucking way blood reached that far from where Harlan was.

The dad killed himself to fuck with the family. But hmm who hired Craig then?

Obviously I then thought the nurse was involved 

Then I thought Chris Evans was the real writer of the stories for some reason and he was working with the dad

Then it really suggests it’s chris Evans too many to mention but I was convinced it was him when the medical lab was blown up as it was the only thing that proved the nurse didn’t do it.

Then it really lays it on really thick with the poirot dining room explanation. It’s soooo long it made me think oh hang on it IS the nurse.

In fact I thought it was even after she was sick (I thought that was a trick)

fjgbgmp,"Am I the only one who guessed it was Ransom from the moment there's that first shot of him storming out and we don't really see him? The way he's shrouded in mystery for the whole first half basically, when all the other characters are being properly introduced, just points all fingers at him in my mind, and I was 100% right.

As soon as he appeared on screen after NOT being in the whole interview with the police sequence, I turned to my housemate who was watching the film with me and jokingly said ""Well, I bet Chris Evans did it""... so when the twist and reveal came I was left completely deflated. We thought perhaps it was supposed to be obvious and the WAY he did it is what's important, as that's definitely the focus of Blanc's final big explanation. But even so, I can't shake the fact that that this is a whodunnit where it's super easy to guess, even based on such small evidence as 'He's not introduced with the rest of the cast' who precisely dunnit from the beginning of the film.

Other than that, the whole switcheroo bottle thing was really well done, love that it becomes blackmail to destroy evidence proving another character's innocence rather than absolve the killer's guilt, never seen that subversion before.

My favourite moment by far is when Marta is standing on the balcony at the end, looking down at the family. Didn't notice until my second watch, but her fingers cover up the ""My coffee. My rules"" part of the mug that she's holding, so it just says ""My house."" and then the credits roll. Absolutely brilliant touch.",e21a17

f921x2c,"There's a lot of themes at play here but I felt that the political message was well done. 

I'm not talking about the alt-right stuff that was played for laughs, I'm talking specifically about the juxtaposition of the family and Marta. 

Harlan has always given his family everything, including the in laws. Yet all they do is steal from him, cheat on his children, etc. None of them have made anything of themselves by themselves and their ""success"" is only due to his original success. 

So he decides he's going to cut them out from his will, not because he hates them but because he feels he's already given them so much and they haven't actually done anything with it.

Then here comes a woman, an immigrant, who treats him well and is kind to him. She entertains his eccentricities without malice and is a true friend. She never asks for any money outside of what shes paid, and genuinely cares for him.

The jokes about which country she's from are funny, but that just shows us that it doesn't matter where she's from because she came here, worked hard and made something of herself alone regardless of how much money she does or doesn't have. And she did it all while being a good person. So he gave the immigrant the fortune because she's actually earned it. 

It's a good message, imo.",e21a17

I went in with pretty much no knowledge outside of it being a fun ""murder mystery"" and that's exactly what I got out of it.

Great pacing (though almost loses steam mid Act 2), funny dialogue, smartly written plot and the thing I liked the most about it is you can see that the cast had a blast with their characters, which was the best part of the movie for me.  I came in wanting a good ""whodunnit"" film, but walked out appreciating the characters way more. I knew Marta didn't do it because there was no way she ""forgot"" the medicine to save his life after she realized she injected him with the wrong (right) medicine. I just kept waiting to see who stole it.

Things that had me lol in the theater:

\- Marta having 4 different backgrounds and everyone being ""outvoted"" on her coming to the funeral

\- Ransom telling everyone to eat shit

\- The ""nazi kid masterbating in the bathroom""

\- Everyone losing their shit when the will is revealed

\- Marta puking at the end

\- Daniel Craig channeling his Frank Underwood accent

And neither of them had a bad fight like the others. Plus Plummer was going to tell her about her husband's infidelity.

fcaxkdo,"I really appreciated the social commentary and criticism that this movie flung at both sides of the isle.  You have the rich conservatives arguing that immigrants should have to work to build something they inherited, not appreciating or the acknowledging the advantages their wealth and status granted them ahead of everyone else.  You had the rich liberals seemingly saying the right things but really being completely empty and disingenuous when their status is threatened.  And the kids.  Oh, the kids. You have the college SJW liberal who befriends an immigrant and helps her when it’s at no cost to her and even argues they should respect Harlan’s wishes but when she realizes that her stake(in this instance her tuition money) is at risk immediately betrays those values and throws her under the bus by revealing her mom’s illegal immigration to the family.  And, of course, you have Reddit’s own alt-right troll.  He literally does almost nothing active in the entire movie except be incredibly unpleasant/shitty/racist and troll on the internet and jerk off, like the oh so vocal all talk people we find on so many subs here.

I also like that in the end it isn’t white vs. immigrants or us vs. them.  Marta is painted as an immigrant who has worked hard for everything she has, likewise Harlan is painted as a white guy who also worked hard to earn his wealth.  The villains are villains not because they are white or have money, but because they’ve allowed their status to corrupt them.  Liberals, conservatives, old, and young all make up the family.  What makes them bad and her good isn’t race or economic status.  That our two “protagonists”(omitting Craig) are a poorer immigrant and a rich white guy shows that.  It’s that two of them had to earn what they have and the others let their status and birthright corrupt them and not appreciate what they have.

I’m bad at explaining all this but I just really liked it.  Took a really complex social political statement that threw shots to both sides of the isle while not falling into the mudpit of “both sides are wrong and there’s to clear right or wrong” that a lot of social commentaries fall into when they throw blows across both sides of the isle.  Yes, both sides are wrong - one blatantly hateful/corrupt and outward about the it and the other one emphatic but corrupt and disingenuous - but clearly the right way is to just be...good.  Be honest, be emphatic, be genuine, work hard, and don’t take for granted things that you are given by birth that others have to overcome obstacles for.  

We need more statements like this in the social sphere.

fkifjaw,"Awesome film, loved the unorthodox way of how the mystery is revealed, barely halfway through it seems like we know the full story and Marta would become the main character trying to stay ahead of Blanc, but it just keeps on unraveling from there. I kind of figured that Chris Evans would be the mastermind soon though as I saw people call him the ""villain"" of the film, him genuinely wanting to help Marta out wouldn't make much sense if that was true. 

This movie has a ton of foreshadowing and seemingly unimportant details that make perfect sense if you go back and look for them, like the dogs noticeably barking at Ransom when he makes his first appearance, and one of the characters mentioning being woke up by barking in the night when making their testimony, I find details like this so cool.

This movie does have one gimmicky aspect which is Marta puking whenever she tells a lie, but it both hinders and helps her throughout so I'll let that slide. I'd be very happy if this turns into a regular franchise as Daniel Craig is wonderfully fun in this role.",e21a17

When Ransom finally does show up to the house for the will reading, the dogs bark at him. Quite the foreshadowing. Poor Fran. The ""you/Hugh"" homonym usage was really clever. I thought she would really made it out okay, but Marta got me.

As an aside, I thought Linda would play a bigger role,but I think the movie did a good job demonstrating that she was obviously way over her head in how she viewed herself. She was not self-made at all (a million dollar loan from her dad;flipping out about not receiving any of the inheritance lol). And the games she played with her father were rather not that complex--simply revealing invisible ink. 

I also liked the social commentary. None of the family knew where Marta was from--in fact, they all said she was a from a different South American country. Even though they family members appeared to be on different sides of the political spectrum, they all treated Marta the same when their true colors came out.

faatyo9,"Just saw this one yesterday, quite entertained. This is one of those movies that has a few things you're supposed to notice and be just bugged enough by until they resolve it later.

First and foremost it initially seemed odd that we got basically the entire death scene moment for moment (at last as Marta remembered it) less than halfway through the movie. And you could tell it was supposed to be accurate because she was only remembering it in her head while Blanc was flipping the coin, she wasn't giving her account to the police yet.

Aside from that, the first odd red flag was how Marta was talking about all the symptoms of morphine and what would happen after five or ten minutes, and Harlan was exhibiting *none* of them. The second, the letter that said ""I know what you did"" was already opened and ripped when Marta first saw it.

The bit at the end with the fake knife was a clever callback to Harlan's earlier line about how some people can be so stupid they can't tell the difference between an actual blade and a prop.

The audience laughed, nobody interrupted the movie, and half of them applauded once the credits rolled. I don't care that some people think clapping is annoying or pointless--I like when it happens, even though I don't partake.

Everybody else has already mentioned just how good so much of it is but I especially want to emphasize just how nervewrackingly brilliant the performances were in the scene where Ana De Armas’ character realizes she accidentally gave him the morphine and how calmly Plummer’s character accepts his fate, and the extreme length he goes to to protect her. In the context of the movie, it immediately establishes such a believable love and bond between the two characters and it was acted beautifully.

Then the will-reading scene... this was pretty much Rian Johnson detonating the bomb he had building up the whole time.

The scene where she wakes up like 5 times in the night was aweosme. her character was smart, loved her father, had her own business and just felt strong.

As a latino, some of the scenes really triggered me (when they're talking immigration and then Don Johnson hands Martha the plate) or how they confuse where's she from every time.

At the end of the film, >!Benoit Blanc reveals that he knew that Marta was involved from the moment he saw her as she had a blood stain on her shoe. Knowing that she was involved, but not knowing in what capacity, why would Blanc allow Marta to accompany himself on his investigation and give her ample opportunity to tamper with evidence? Even if Blanc was confident that Marta was involved but not guilty, there is no way that he could have known that Marta would not destroy evidence that was left by the real killer. !<

 That being said the middle act still flies IMO, I think the pacing was great. 

The tracking shot as Marta leaves the building is phenomenal and one of my favorite shots I've seen.

Along with the great pacing, the editing is really fantastic. 

So many clues of Ransom being bad the whole time that I completely threw out after he ""took Marta's side"".

The final shot is one of my favorites ever.

Michael Shannon was fantastic and I overlooked that the first time because I was too focused on Ana de Armas. The scene where he goes to Marta's house was so incredible. 

Score is generic but still super fitting and really helps control the story.

Overall it is still one of my favorites of the year, I hate that it will be overlooked at the Oscars. There is still some good stuff coming but I don't think it's too much to say I think this movie deserves a screenplay nom, editing nom, and lead actress nom.",e21a17

f913v5k,"Spoilers ahoy!

Had no expectations coming in, but really really ended up loving the movie, enough to bring me to this thread. 

First, after scrolling through there were about 5 ~~now 6~~ references to the multiple South American countries Marta was supposed to come from, as well as being “outvoted” about having her at the funeral. It’s hilarious that everyone loves it but well deserved.

A couple of standouts for me:
>!* Don Johnson’s character causing his own demise was a brilliant bit of poetic justice, especially given how subtly the baseball kept returning all over the place. 
* The introductory scenes were so good! So well cut.
* Ransom being shown as separate from his family during the initial will reading, but surrounded by them in the final scene when Marta was about to confess her role in Harlan’s death.
* I will not eat one iota of shit!
* The tightness of the film and attention to detail! The timing, the cinematography, the music all heightened both drama and comedy. The dog coming back with the broken part of the trellis after we thought Marta addresses it.
* The indictment of capitalism regardless of where people were on the political spectrum.
* Marta saying she’ll use _her_ resources to fight the immigration? Perfection. Especially in the light of the microaggressions we’ve seen this family have to her.
* Chris Evans as Ransom endearing me to his character with his pretty boy looks? Ngl, Rian Johnson, you got me there.
* Not sure if I'm recalling correctly, but Harlan's painting was actually painted as severe while Marta was torn up with guilt over killing her friend when she sees it ~2 times in the movie, and the last time she sees him, at the end of the movie with the blanket over her shoulder and his mug in her hands, it's actually painted that Harlan was smiling.!<

One of the details that seemed like a miss to me was that Christopher Plummer’s character didn’t seem to put his go stones the right way. ~~S/o to Hikaru no Go.~~ That Marta wouldn’t would be an endearing part of someone who just wants to make beautiful patterns.

Editing in mobile hates me, sorry!",e21a17

He completely proved me wrong, he looked and acted like a mid-20s douchebag and not like the 38 year old he is. Just goes to show how good of an actor he is

Edit: And Fantastic Four movies, how could I forget",e21a17

The theater I was in was laughing a lot. Great Nana was a character that provided a lot of laughs too. They didn't forget the small details, like when Harlan says his family can't tell a real knife from a stage prop. It lets us know quick who can be trusted and who can't. Marta's vomiting to lying was hilarious and used very well as a plot device throughout the movie.

So in Roma, Cleo, is always told that she is part of the family, but even after everything she does like (Roma spoiler) >!saving the kids from drowning!<, she is always given work to do and seen as an outsider. And in this film, everyone keeps telling Marta that she is part of the family, but when it came down to it, she was also seen as an outsider who wasn’t really equal to them, much like Cleo is in Roma. Sorry if this is dumb, but I just wanted to write it out lol",e21a17

When Marta was revealed to have accidentally killed Harlan, I was rooting for her to get away with it and a part of me was like is Daniel Craig supposed to lose and be some sort of bumbling detective? But nope the guys a genius! Just a lil weird. 

Rian Johnson is all about subverting expectations and he killed it. This movie was engaging as hell. I was always paying attention to details in the background and whatever the characters said to see just what was being foreshadowed or how Rian was gonna twist it. It just kept you guessing which is what I love about these kinds of movies. 

This is easily one of my favorite films now. Everything about it was awesome. The fact it was in present day was so refreshing. The cast was awesome and Marta was a great character to root for.

The characters' motivations and personalities are so clearly defined even with how quickly everything moves along and how many people there are to focus on.

There's one shot right before that line where the camera is panning with the knife in the foreground, and is framed in a way that the shot ends with the knife going straight across Harlan's neck. Right when that happens he says the name ""Ransom"" and starts talking about him. 

I thought that was a cool bit of foreshadowing, even though obviously Ransom wasn't the one that killed him in the end. But it did point to the fact that he was ultimately responsible for it all.",e21a17

Morphine thingy kinda sucks, like why did he just slit his throat like that, also, wouldn't he feel something already? But it felt like Harlan was really tired since he already changed his will a week before the incident, this has been planned all along and he already saw a chance to end his suffering (dealing with his offsprings and especially in-laws).

Still satisfying to watch. I just really like staring at Chris Evans' angelic face <3",e21a17

For me, 10/10

Yes i might be exaggerating the rating a little but that's fine. Because thos movie is great and i want everyone to watch it.

Daniel Craig is a fucking amazing actor; frankly, his potential is wasted on the Bond movies, he should be doing more roles like this one.

Ana de Armas is adorable as usual and Chris Evans seems to have enjoyed not playing a goody good guy for once. His character is supposed to be an asshole and he plays it perfectly.

The plot, while a simple whodunit, is so competently executed with just the right pacing; humour perfectly interspersed with suspense, which in turn is perfectly interspersed with one small reveal after another to keep the audience hooked till the end when the full plot is unravelled.

I guess i enjoyed it so much because it is fucking refreshing to watch a well made, completely original movie after sooooooo fucking long",e21a17

Linda's special way of communicating with her dad; Ransom and Go; both Walt and Richard's patheticness. 

The only character I actually felt sympathy for was Meg - yeah, she got Marta back to the house on false premises, but she didn't seem to have any major character flaws (like her mum stealing the money), and got cut out as a result.",e21a17

The fact that it was incorporated in the end of the movie really made me happy as a law nerd.",e21a17

I've never been huge into mystery-type stories (have read all the original Sherlock Holmes stories though and do intend to get around to some Agathie Christie at some point) so I'm coming at this film as a bit of a newbie to the genre. I liked it; don't know if hardcore murder mystery buffs would or not.

One thing that surprised me I guess is that how Harlan's death went down isn't saved as a big reveal at the end or anything, but rather shown explicitly early on. Then it's just watching how Blanc puts it all together. A few other random points:

-There were some great sweaters in this movie

-I really, really want to live in a house like that. So beatiful and quaint

-Loved some of the song choices throughout: Sundown during the bar scene, Sweet Virginia during the end credits. I think I even heard a Spirit song in one of the birthday party scenes

-Not sure why the hospital specifically phoned Marta to tell her about Fran's death, but it sure was convenient for the plot

-Ransom's character started off as an asshole, then looked like he would turn into a good guy with a heart after all for a bit, then...nope, pure villain. Hahah.

-Lol at the donut hole speech

-Daniel Craig was obviously having a shit ton of fun in this movie. ""I suspect...foul play. And I have eliminated nooo suspects."" Wonder if they'll make any more movies with this character....",e21a17

fahgwwb,"I wonder why he cut Jaime Lee Curtis' character out of the will? Yes, she had a cheating husband but he was going to tell her about him. Other than giving $1M in seed money when she started her business, the movie never indicates that she is screwing over Harlan or anything. Yes, she reacts badly and lashes out at Ana de Armas' character when the will reading is revealed but it's justified. As far as she and the audience knows, she has a pretty good relationship with her dad (secret communications between them and all), so for him to cut her out and giving it all to his nurse would definitely cause a reaction on her part.

EDIT: On second thought, maybe Dad thought that she might end up giving a lot of her money to Ransom, who she did raise to be a spoiled brat, so he just figured it would be easier to cut them all off.",e21a17

One thing that stood out to me was the fact he came during the will reading, even though he admits he isn’t getting anything. I was kinda of like why would you come? But given by the end of the film we learn he knew Marta was getting it all. In the moment we the audience were led to believe Ransom came to stir drama, but given that he knew no one in the family wasn’t getting anything it definitely added suspicion to his character. There is no doubt in my mind Daniel Craig’s character realized this which he then realized that that was the argument Ransom and Harlan has.  Also Ransom, from what I remember, was also the only one who was calm and did not seem shocked at the will reading compared to the rest of the family.

Daniel Craig is great in this. Always knew he had great comedic chops but he was really freed from typecasting here. His monologues, his “method”, and his accent were just a riot. 

Ana de Armas should be getting some more elevated work real soon.  She’s fantastic.

1. There was no sense in slitting his throat as Harlan (a veteran crime novel writer) must have known that Morphine would be detected in his blood anyway through the forensic test report, raising doubt & investigation on Marta. It would have made sense if he had kept an empty syringe with Morphine bottle lying on the floor near him implying suicide by morphine overdose.
2. When Ransom went back to the home during funeral day to switch the labels, he should have realised then and there that Marta gave the right medicine, by looking at the bottles (the one with morphine content would've been found full and the one with actual medicine empty).",e21a17

Like what others have said I wish the detective that Daniel Craig plays gets a sequel or spin-off or something. Hilarious, how he starts leading us to think he's an imbecile, then the big reveal he figures everything out. 

At one point after they showed us that Marta committed the crime. I was thinking to myself... ok... so what's the rest of this movie about? It's about Daniel Craig trying to figure out that she did it? 

The twist at the end... it was ok. I saw some of it coming. The mix-up, mix-up. The way Fran fit into the whole picture I found that a little strange. But, it was alright.

fdfr2pz,"Just saw it with my wife finally. We absolutely loved it.

I dunno if i'm just a nerd, but I noticed a couple of parallels between Knives Out and Breaking Bad (he directed Ozymandias and The Fly for those who don't know).

Greatana definitely kinda seemed like a Hector Salamana-type character. Can't really communicate much, but still is an integral part of the story and plot. I also noticed some slight parallels between Marta's character and Walter White's character as well- where she has situations where she has to decide to keep someone alive, or to let someone die. 

Also, for anyone who has seen Ozymandias, Knives Out kinda follows the same direction from Rian Johnson. Hits you in the beginning with a real emotion moment (I won't give the BB scene away for anyone who hasn't seen it) and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the emotional conclusion which is fronted by an unraveling of plot twists and shocking scenes.

One thing I didn't understand - I get why Harlan cut off most of the family, as they were all terrible in their own way. But why his daughter Linda? Unless I missed something, she was not shitty and they got along well and even had their own secret note system? The only reason I can think of is maybe because he didn't want to leave anything to her because she was married to a cheater and didn't want him to be entitled to anything he left to her but again I'm not sure.

Also, when Linda saw the empty letter and smirked, instant bells rang in my ears, it's one of *those* letters, lol.   

Also, a family member of mine hypothesized that Harlan possibly wanted to commit suicide from the get-go. It just felt that too much time had passed by, from the time he got the ""wrong injection"" and that he would have felt the effects at that time. Just gave me a suspicious vibe.

The passion he coaxes from his actors, the tone he pulls out of the woodwork of the sets, and the suspense he creates out of thin air and on short notice are spectacular.  He created a truly original movie, and anyone who disagrees should think on this:

-The murderer hired the detective who caught him.

-The murderer was arrested for murder, but he never even committed the murder he intended to.

-The original death, Harlan's suicide that he only committed so that it wouldn't be murder, was completely unnecessary.

>!Here is what I don't understand still.  Fran sees Ransom messing with the medicine bag, so she knows something is up.  She calls her friend for a toxicology report on Harlan.  The report comes back and says his blood was totally normal, nothing out of the ordinary.  At that point, how does she know about the medicine mix up with Marta if Marta has not confessed to anyone?

f984rhr,[deleted],e21a17
f8upnfe,"I know it’s a meme at this point, but I loved how Johnson subverted my expectations while simultaneously delivering satisfaction in spades.

Marta is the “killer” and we learn it early on? Great, especially Harlan walking her through the coverup.

Blanc seemingly not catching on to Marta’s nervous deception? Lots of fun, but also throughly great that he was on to the real killer all along (I was worried at the end when he was playing with the labels on the bottles and rolling up his sleeve that he would manage to kill himself while explaining a plot that’s didn’t actually happen). Loved that Blanc could seem foolish but still be a worthy sleuth.

Also loved that Ransom was convincingly not as shitty as the rest of the family when he starts to help Marta (even if for his cut), but still thrilled that the character who epitomized the family’s ugly behavior wouldn’t be let off the hook thematically.

Finally, I found the film’s first act to be really refreshingly structured. We start after the murder, but filling in the circumstances with interviews and flashbacks that smartly set the scene and tell us about each family member. Instead of spending like 30 minutes waiting for Harlan to be killed, the game is afoot from the start. I really enjoyed *Ready or Not* earlier this year, but given that the hook (in-law family hunts the bride as a ritual) was all over the marketing, the film had an entire first act where the audience is steps ahead of the protagonist. That was never a problem in *Knives Out*, especially as Marta is the the true protagonist, and not Blanc (as I had assumed going in).

Overall, Johnson does here exactly what he did with *The Last Jedi*, which I love. He delivers the results we want from this kind of film, but in a way we couldn’t predict.",e21a17
f94m2uq,"I think it is particularly tough to put a new twist on the murder mystery genre and Rian Johnson does a great job of giving something fresh. Essentially telling you who the killer is and how they did it right off the bat and watching instead as a sympathetic character tries to dodge the rap while showcasing the downfalls of wealth is really engaging and a new way to tackle the genre.   
  
That being said, any seasoned mystery fan will suspect right off the bat that it isn't as simple as all that. There's always another layer and the movie in this case sometimes tips its hand more than it should with some not-so-subtle dialogue. Harlan specifically speaking to Marta about switching vials and outlying what stages exactly he should be experiencing after being poisoned while clearly not experiencing them felt unnecessary.
  
The movie also falls victim to a classic pitfall that has long plagued daytime television crime shows. ""The guest star is always the bad guy"". To its credit, *Knives Out* admirably tries to combat this by stacking the cast with some fantastic character actors, however when a certain very famous pop culture icon is absent for half the movie after being heavily featured in trailers it sets off alarm bells and at risk of sounding like ""that guy"" felt painfully obvious from the start.  
  
I particularly liked the open ending. It leaves a lot for discussion I think and I'd like to hear your opinions. Do you think Marta kept the money? Her mug at the end says ""My house"" implying she might but we've also seen her exposed to a whole movie where she sees wealth destroy this family. It's a double edged ~~sword~~ knife and I'd like to think Marta realizes this and thought she might give all the money to charity instead. Again, what are your thoughts?

By that point it's pretty obvious he's the one. I was hoping for a larger twist but it was all pretty straightforward.

I'm a little torn on rating this movie between an A or B rank. On one hand the humor, cinematography, acting, production, dialogue, pacing, and editing were all top notch. But on the other hand the story was fairly above average. A little too straightforward for a whodunnit - especially one with so much technical caliber. A solid 90/100 if I were to put down a number.

Daniel Craig's donut monologue is the best piece of comedic writing I've heard in forever.

I'm almost disappointed that when Harlan mentioned Ransom not knowing a prop knife from the real thing that I didn't immediately suspect the movie would end with Ransom trying to murder somebody with a prop knife.

I was \*so\* sure going in that Harlan wasn't dead that it took me until 3/4 of the way through to remember that Jamie Lee Curtis specifically mentions seeing Harlan in his casket at the funeral. I feel like that line was in there just to let people know that Harlan really was dead, so that was pretty dumb of me.

fik8h9s,"Posted this elsewhere and would love to get feedback on it:

To me, the movie was about how a lot of Americans are in favor of immigration, up until it hurts them or their jobs. Marta was hard-working and way better to Harlan than any of his children, and, by Harlan's logic, she ""earned"" the inheritance. We can think of immigrants who come in, work hard, and contribute to the American economy/achieve the American dream as her.

A lot of us support immigration up *until immigrants threaten our jobs or way of live*. ALL of the Thrombeys turn on Marta. The Jaeden Martell character and his mother were the most openly racist and opposed to Marta (they were the only characters not pictured talking to Marta, save for Jaeden Martell's insult about her being an anchor baby.) You see some racism embedded in other characters, specifically the Drysdales. 

The dad hammered on and on about how Marta was working her way up to the American dream and deserved to be in this country, and yet, treated her like a servant (handing his plate to her) and being the first to demand she renounce her inheritance. Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis's character) was less openly bad about this imo, but she still made some off-color comments that hinted at conservatism/wanting to keep all the money to herself, even though she had done nothing to earn it and had her own business. At her core, she was still the same.

After the openly racist and likely conservative characters fall, we see the more sympathetic/""like us"" characters fall too. Joni prooooobably manipulates her daughter into giving them information about Marta (this would happen off-screen), and Meg, a character who seemed the kindest and most defensive of Marta (look at the beginning, where she tells the police calling Marta 'the help' to fuck off), turns her in and risks her mom getting deported because Marta will not renounce the inheritance. Marta has already told her she'll pay for her college and give her whatever she needs, but that is not good enough. 

Then Walt, who represents the American moderates (to me), goes and tries to strong-arm Marta into giving them her inheritance. 

Almost all of them say ""give back"" the inheritance. They all feel entitled to it, even though it was never theirs to begin with. None of them except Linda (who has already gotten a million-dollar loan) seem to be close at all to Harlan, except to get his money. Meg included, she's not even there for Harlan's cake cutting (normal for college girls to want to go see their friends, but if she viewed him as anything more than a distant relative, she'd have stayed.)

The movie encourages us to consider ourselves more harshly. The American dream doesn't belong to us for living here, it belongs to anyone willing to make an effort/work hard. 

As a side note, I'm a graduate student at a design school, and there are a good deal of immigrants here, as it's a widely-renowned school. I see this kind of garbage all the time with people I work with, as design is a fairly easy field for anyone with talent to break into, even if they don't have citizenship. 

I **loved** this movie because it captured all the hypocrisy many people in America have, even if they are supposedly leftist. The characters all look down on the ""creepy Nazi child,"" but prove they're not different than him. All of my friends and colleagues rightfully express a lot of distaste for the alt-right, but, when it comes to their jobs, say some borderline racist things (""you shouldn't be able to work at X unless you go to grad school,"" when a lot of immigrants get design credentialing from bootcamps, which are totally valid and worthwhile.)",e21a17

I got tipped off that Chris Evans was the true villain when he suggested to her that she check her e-mail. Though I obviously didn't put his whole motivation together. 

It was sorta cool that while Ana De Armas was the protagonist, and she did play Daniel Craig a bit, Daniel Craig was still competent in putting everything in the end.

Felt Chris Evans character was kind of set up as the main suspect from the get go and was expecting something out of left field. 

I don't know how, but I kind of suspected that Harland was alive the whole time, and he wanted to see how people would react to his death vs how they'd react thst they wousont get his money.  It's said early on that he likes to play games.

I just feel there was such a huge ensemble powerhouse cast and they were hardly used. Entire characters are pointless and non-factors, they could've been combined or cut completely and it wouldn't make much of a difference. A lot of them weren't even used as red-herring bait. This would've benefited much more from a lowkey cast making their breakthrough, keeping Daniel Craig, Ana De Armas and Christopher Plummer while the rest could've been up and comers. Other than those 3, Toni Collette was the only one with memorable moments. How you waste Michael Shannon, Lakeith Stanfield, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Don Johnson is beyond me. Chris Evans was oddly distracting, especially since the mystery around him wasn't even trying to make you think it's anyone else. Katherine Langford seemed oddly placed into this film, not matching anywhere near the charisma or presence of the others yet while still having a substantial amount of lines, and Jaeden Martell did practically nothing.

In three  out of those four cases, there is a clearly stated reason for why he  disinherited them, and they pretty much had it coming.  But in the case  of his daughter Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis), unless I missed it, the story  never gives a reason for why he disinherited her.  (Harlan finds that  his daughter's husband is cheating on her, and Harlan plans on telling  his daughter, so that gives the husband a motive.)  Clearly Harlan still  felt protective towards his daughter, enough to tell her that her  husband was cheating on her, so why would he cut her out of the will  too?

(I realize he wanted to leave everything to Marta, but, given that she'd be equally well off regardless of whether he left her $50 million or $60 million, it doesn't seem to make sense that he wouldn't set aside $10 million for his daughter if he still liked her and she hadn't done anything wrong.)",e21a17

Ana de Armas was great and I was really happy to see her as an outright, non-romantic lead. And she did a great job. Outside the (stylishly) ridiculous honesty quirk, her character was very believably human. Evans was great too. You could feel how much fun he was having getting to play a shitheel instead of a patriotic poster boy. Craig's role actually felt a bit minimized, but I think with him being so intentionally ridiculous (CSI:KFC, indeed) it was for the best. But I still loved him. Him and the cops made a great little comedy troupe. And everyone else was great being melodramatic and terrible.

The mystery element felt thin. I don't think it was unbelievable, but him being the murderer was obvious as soon as he started interacting with Marta. Maybe that was intentional? 'Here's the obviously guilty guy setting up his own plan, wonder how he's going to pull it off?'

First, holy hannah, I think it was great casting to make Don Johnson and Chris Evans father and son. Say what you will about him, but Johnson is still a handsome man. 

For as much as I loved Daniel Craig, I would kill to see Lakeith Stanfield in the goofy detective role. He is one of my favorite actors right now. I have liked him in everything I've seen him in.

They did a great job making who the ultimate bad person was, though that person really should have been more present earlier in the film. Someone with such a big name was bound to be in a big role so I was waiting to see how  they'd be used in the story.",e21a17

f9i7gwg,"I saw this the other night and thought it was great. For context I generally like whodunnits and Rian Johnson's other work, as well as most of the cast, so I guess I was predisposed to like this, but I think it would be enjoyable even for someone who isn't.

What I liked: On a superficial level, the twists both got me pretty good. I didn't expect Marta to be involved in the death at all, and I thought Ransom was too obvious to be the true villain. The performances were all solid, but I thought it really showed how much fun the cast obviously had making the movie. I liked seeing Chris Evans as a dirtbag, and Daniel Craig is the standout, but really the entire cast was great. I really liked the portion of the movie that was Marta trying to obstruct the investigation. In particular her throwing the piece of siding away was a hilarious visual. It's also a very funny script, and it kept me guessing the entire time.

What I didn't like: It was a little heavy handed with the ""alt-right troll"" stuff. And while it was already a 2:15 movie, I felt that some of the characters didn't get enough screentime and it hurt the movie. For example, we didn't see enough of Katherine Langford's Meg actually being a friend to Marta to make it hurt when she betrays her. And we didn't really get very much of Jacob actually being a Nazi, just people saying he was.

Overall I really enjoyed this.  It's a 9/10 for me, and I can't wait to watch it again. I'd be excited to see any potential follow up as well, I'd watch Benoit Blanc solve more mysteries any time.",e21a17

fcdqmhl,"Hey there. So, I’m a nurse and the major issue I had with this film was that even if Marta thought she was drawing up 100mg of ketorolac, but actually drew up morphine instead there is still no way she would have doses Harlan with enough morphine to guarantee death. 

First of all, a standard vial of ketorolac has a total of 30mg/ml. This is the confirmed concentration she had based on clips and screenshots I found from the movie. If she wanted to give 100mg (which is a weird dose to give in the first place, but I’ll ignore that for now) she would have drawn up 3.33mls. Morphine vials can come in a number of concentrations, but you will never see a 30mg/ml vial of morphine. So even if the vial she had (ignoring the fact that she would need more than one) had a concentration as high as 10mg/ml, and she drew up the 3.33ml the total dose of morphine Harlan would have received is 33.3mg. That may or may not kill him depending on how much he weighed and his exposure to narcotics. She could have just monitored his vital signs to see if there was a need to escalate care, but there is no guarantee of death at this dose for an adult. 

He also would have experienced a pretty instant high if she pushed morphine as fast as ketorolac. These are all things that, as a nurse, Marta should have known. This is why I think Marta is the true villain of the film. 

At work all the standard vials of morphine I use are actually 2mg/ml (10mg/ml is just the highest vial concentration that I could find that was manufactured, any high higher and they are packaged differently specifically for PCAs) so if she actually had one of those instead, his 3.33mls would have been a puny 6.6mg. I’ve given higher doses to children. Again, something Marta should have known. 

Sorry that was so long and a little confusing. I hope people understand what I’m saying....none of my co-workers have seen the movie so I have no one to really discuss it with in depth.",e21a17
fhw3g4o,"**OBVIOUSLY INCORRECT THEORY I HAD AHEAD**:

Just saw it. This movie had me speculating even after it was over! I **SWORE** that Marta and Ransom were in cahoots somehow, whether a secret couple, or what have you. I was certain the whole “she’s better at Go” was going to end up that she was the *true* mastermind behind this because she was *always* steps ahead of everyone else: faking the whole “vomiting while lying” thing (remember Verbal Kint?), pretending to Harlan to mix up the vials because she *knew* he would react in the way he did, and generally acting like she was innocent to fool Blanc. I thought she and Ransom were in it together and that he would have agreed based on the thought that he wouldn’t actually kill Fran and that he would go to club fed for a little while like he said, and then when he was out, hook up with Marta in whatever country she was *actually* from (which he truly knew), and that would be how they “got away with it”, also setting up a sequel for Blanc.

Later that call seemed to be connected to Meg having told the family about Marta’s undocumented mom, but I don’t see how. Did that betrayal happen on-screen? - if so I missed it. 

Meg’s demeanor throughout the call strongly hinted that she was making the call under some duress, & that (as later revealed to be the case) the whole rest of the family was off-camera listening to her side of the conversation.  I didn’t get how or why they had made her make that call.",e21a17

The character of Fren. What was she trying to accomplish? She hated ransom and was shown as not someone who would blackmail him for money? If she had toxicology, why don't go directly to the police?

It pays tribute to the ole' whodunnits while also skewering them. It hides who the real star is (although I've got a feeling it won't be long before Ana De Armas is on their level) by surrounding her with big names and more recognizable up-and-comers. 

It changes the game every time you think you have it figured out. It sets up Chekov's guns without even making you realize it. It's topical and definitely political, but doesn't smash you upside the head with it- it's part of a far greater whole.

It's fitting that Frank Oz shows up, because in some ways it has a almost Henson Muppet-like feel to it. A zaniness mixed with humanity.

Still, a movie not meeting my initial expectations doesn’t mean it’s not great, just means that I know what to watch for. What details matter and what don’t. It’s not on the director to execute on marketing, or on what people think about it. A lesson Rian Johnson continues to teach us.",e21a17

However, Harlan seems like a very smart, thorough man, and particularly caring where Marta is concerned, so I kind of agree with Walt when he tells Marta that she's in a tough spot (because of Harlan).  Two things:

1. Marta probably didn't need ALL the money. Harlan could have cut her in and made her a multi-millionaire without making her the sole target for his cutthroat, opportunistic family's wrath.
2. Why did Harlan tell Ransom, who everybody paints as a ruthless, manipulative jerk, that he wasn't getting any money, that Marta was and then throw in his face that Marta was better at the board game than him?

ff5yal2,"Just saw this for the first time and really enjoyed it. However I want to ask if anybody else noticed the following particular scene.

When the will is read out and all the family members are going crazy, they surround the will reader and are yelling all these reasons for why the will is invalid and that the inheritance can't just all go to Marta.

Then for a moment, the camera cuts to Walt, the son who had been running the publishing company, who says something along the lines that the dad ""takes morphine and iodine... Or something"".

It seems that after he says that medication he looks around for a second, like he just revealed information he shouldn't know, and then says ""or something"" to cover his tracks.

So basically I noticed this little part during the chaotic yelling and I thought I had noticed a significant clue pointing towards who was ultimately responsible. I also thought at this point that there was something up with the medication as it can't be as simple as Marta simply making a mistake.

So here I was thinking I'm a genius for noticing this clue but ultimately Walt was completely innocent and this apparent ""clue"" was either a minor redhearing, or, most likely, just nothing at all.

What a blast. Most fun I've had in the theatre in a long time.

Was really lucky to get tickets for this and I'm so happy that I did. I hope this movie brings back mystery films in a big way.

Great ensemble cast. Everyone brings their own flavour to it and the chemistry between everyone is great. The dialogue is hilarious. The film never takes itself too seriously and it made the whole watching experience so much fun.

Definitely had some heavy Hitchcock influences in there, mixed in with the board game clue. The set decoration was amazing as was the house they lived in.

If I had to say anything really negative about the film is that and it pains me to say this because I love her, Ana De Armas's performance wasn't as strong as the supporting cast around her. (and how could it be because she's around fucking all stars). Also the film doesn't keep the pace of the beginning into the middle, but it picks it all right back up for the end.

Perhaps I just wasn't a huge fan of the cause of death being revealed early on and working it's way around to the truth - which I found anti-climactic. I can certainly appreciate some of the cinematography and dialogue, particularly for Daniel Craig's character, but the overall story just felt a bit generic maybe? There was almost a feeling of Wes Anderson knockoff, corporate-whimsy to it that I can't quite put my finger on, like they tried a bit too hard to make it feel 'classic'.

Second: technically, the movie was a masterpiece. Absolutely fitting music. Also, the character of Lakeith Stanfield meta-narratively expressed what most of the audience was thinking; the whole set was just like playing a game of Cluedo. Kudos to the cinematographer, Steve Yedlin.

Third: I did not love the twist at the end. The character of Chris Evans was given the less depth of the anyway caricature-like characters of the rest of the family, so the twist seemed a bit hollow, as if I was thinking subconsciously that we know so little of him that he might as well have done it.

And last: Daniel Craig was thouroughly enjoyable, at times as overracting as possible and at times as serious as necessary. He seemd to have enjoyed himself a lot. I would very happily see more movies with Benoit Blanc as the lead protago-sleuth.",e21a17

I liked the detail that pretty much everyone in the family was ready to throw Marta under the bus to get their inheritance.

Here he gets to show us he does indeed have range, comedic chops, and can do sinister just nicely.   


Daniel Craig was perhaps the one who stole every scene, between this and Logan Lucky I prefer Craig's comedic non-Bond roles by far. He has so many little moments in this movie that hit your funny bone  just right.   


Ana de Armis was another perfectly cast, and perfectly played character, I felt her character had to walk a tightrope in how her character was perceived, too dumb and she comes across as a bobble-head and there's no tension. Too self-aware then she comes across as calculating and it throws off the dynamics of the story. She hit that ""sweet and innocent"" yet not a bimbo or dolt, whose desire to do the right thing (or at least responsible thing) inevitably put her in a situation most people would shirk, and gave rise to this most-interesting ""who-dun-it.""


Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collete (Damn where's she been hiding?), perfectly played the back-stabbing bickering entitled family of leeches, and I laughed out loud when Don Johnson rails against immigrants as he nonchalantly hands his dish to the immigrant professional nurse.

I think the story takes a hit when a big twist is revealed about half way in, because all of the subsequent reveals seem to lack the same punch.  Still Knives Out stays entertaining the entire run time and kept me engaged.  If you don't like this one I think you need to reevaluate your feelings about The Last Jedi, and do some soul searching.

One last thing I will say is that while watching this, I think its the perfect holiday movie for a lot of families.

The way it was shown made it kind of unintentionally funny. ""I know about everything you did, and you're going to jail because of it, i just brought you to this isolated location to tell you this, I'm gonna leave now, wait why are you-- oh god wait wait""

I loved the performances, I loved that despite not getting all that much screentime individually the family was still able to convey an enormous sense of wicked unity and how each character had a different chip on their shoulder that made them all potential suspects, until the reveal early on.  Suprising amount of political commentary as well which was unexpected but really helped give the film a unique subtext. It really was a wonderful trip from start to end, with subversions that felt earned and clever rather than a bait and switch that Rian has been known for in the past (even if I don't think TLJ is bad at all, the twists were actually set up here).

A 33x stronger dose of morphine, delivered intravenously, would knock the recipient out IMMEDIATELY, or at the least make them a little loopy. Harlan was perfectly lucid in those 10 minutes preceding his suicide, which would have tipped off any good nurse (or Harlan himself, for that matter) that maybe he didn't just get a massive dose of morphine. The fact that they went into so much detail about how the labels were switched, and how Marta instinctively recognized the familiar heft/viscosity/density/whatever of the correct medicine to show that she actually WAS a good nurse is a complete affront to the reality of being injected with a 33x stronger dose of morphine. This was really the only glaring plot hole in the entire movie: the whole point of injecting a drug intravenously is that it hits IMMEDIATELY! It's right in the bloodstream! It's friggin' morphine! It would have rendered Harlan comatose with pleasure in SECONDS, instead of this arbitrary 10 minute window where he has time to plan out his own death in excruciating detail.

I love the way the story is presented from each one of the characters. A lesser film would have spent the bulk of the time focused on the actual interrogations between Blanc/the police and the family. Instead, we visually get to see how each family member “remembered” the party, including their biases and omissions. The interrogation scenes do an amazing job of fleshing out every single character (including the more minor ones) and the entire film is a masterclass in visual storytelling.",e21a17

I agree with the sentiment that it would've been even more fun if the killer wasn't Ransom, but I also figure it's really hard to make a solid whodunnit, and I'm not sure how they could've tied it to someone else without making it seem forced.  Maybe just more misdirection on the other characters would've helped.

I also suspect Harlan knew Marta would help his family.  In a way, giving the inheritance to her was the most equitable way to split the money.  Giving it directly to them would've just led to even more fighting.  Having a single person in charge solves that.",e21a17

There’s one thing that confused me though: So originally we’re supposed to think Marta mixed up the two medicines haphazardly and accidentally gave Harlan 100 mg of morphine. However, it’s then revealed that Ransom swapped the medicines so she actually gave him the 100mg of the correct medicine. Why did we need the whole explanation that she actually gave the right medicine by being experienced and knowing what they look like? That seems to overcomplicate it.

Some odd things though.

First Walts wife seems like such an odd role. She has no lines and doesnt have any reason to be there. She is the only character in the movie that doesnt need to be there. 

Second the comedy in Rian Johnsons movies always seem so odd. I almost wish that Edgar Wright had directed this instead. The jokes just dont even seem like jokes they seem like a deleted scene or a blooper that found it's way back into the movie. He doesnt understand how to put comedy in his movies.

Third, this movie could have been 30 minutes shorter. When we already know pretty much what happened we aren't on the edge of our seats trying to figure it out like other movies.

I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a bunch of fun! However, my girlfriend didn't because she didn't expect it to be a comedy. I felt like this is going to have the Cabin in the Woods effect.

But that one line from Harlan where he says something to the effect of ""they're all horrible people so I've cut them all off... like you said"" stuck with me as a bit unexplained. If Marta is empirically good of heart (which probably isn't true for anyone that isn't a movie character), wouldn't she have never said that - or pointed it out to Harlan?

I also was thinking from early on in the film that Marta was being set up to be highly knowledgable on mysteries and whodunnits just from the fact that her sister and mother are watching them constantly. 

Then going back to the Go board game and the lines with Ransom. Marta ultimately ""beat"" Ransom, but it doesn't really appear to be because she did anything besides not let Fran die, and then muster up the ability to lie without puking (for a short period of time). And even in the last Go game with Harlan, she was winning and he knew it, but instead of letting her finish the game he knocked the board which started a series of events which led to his suicide.

The IMDB boards don't exist anymore, but I was hoping that some others were starting to work on some fun theories for Marta really masterminding the whole series of events from the beginning, and Rian Johnson putting very subtle clues into the film.

It turns the whole whodunnit setup on its head when it reveals what happens, but you know there is something more to happen and when the twists come they are well earned. No line or setup is wasted, house keepers drug stash, Plummer's line about Ranson noy knowing real knife from fake one, all end up being important.

3. People aware of Johnson's style: Since the shifty asshole is so obvious, he is the culprit.

f8ulbsa,"Honestly, this is probably one of the bigger disappointments of the year for me. Don't get me wrong it was entertaining and had a few laughs, but I really just was disappointed in the direction this movie took. Once they reveal Marta's story, it just became super predictable after that. I think if it was revealed later, it would have been less disappointing, but honestly I just thought it was just a lame reveal. The movie started really strong as it was building up motive behind all suspects, but it lost its intrigue after the reveal.

This paragraph will have big spoilers. I knew the moment it was showing Marta's story and how Harlan mentioned her mom was an undocumented immigrant that he wrote the whole family out of the will and left it all to Marta. It was also very obvious that Ransom was connected as well. It was just so obvious from the barking dogs. So after it was revealed that it was suicide, I was able to piece most of the remaining ""mystery"" together.

The movie was entertaining though and did have it's moments. The cast overall did decent, even if Daniel Craig's accent seemed all over the place. I do wish this wasn't marketed as a murder mystery because maybe that would have diminishes my disappointment since that is not what we got. But ultimately once it's revealed early on what game Rian Johnson was playing, it became quite predictable and lost its intrigue.

SPOILER WARNING 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Was there a missing scene during the big reveal?

Blanc intervenes during Marta's public confession after noticing something in the toxicity report. The two policemen, Blanc and Marta rush into the Knives room to discuss the development, Blanc fiddling with two vials and then rolling up his sleeves before taking a seat. For those in the audience who had already guessed what was going on, they might have been gearing up for quite a dramatic and physical proof and demo of what happened. I personally was looking forward to a blind injection test being made on Ransom to pull out a confession.

Some dialogue later and Blanc is peeling off labels hiding the names of the medicine in each vial to suggest that Marta has the professional ability to tell them apart by feel, replacing his sleeves and jacket as he does so. Of course as the scene was finally presented he was now referring to the original event the night of Harlan's death.

But I can't help but feel that there WAS a blind test done but perhaps actually by Marta on Blanc, and that he was actually referring to something more in the moment that I now reckon had been left on the cutting room floor. Why else would he roll his sleeves up and down? Why did he blank out the labels on the vials? Why did he have the vials at all? He didn't need them to demonstrate his point. It would also have given those in the audience who hadn't guessed about the switch an opportunity to figure it out before the literal reveal.

Thoughts? It's a tiny issue that doesn't affect the film, but it just jarred a bit in a film that was otherwise so well made and smooth. A ""am I the only one who saw that"" check.",e21a17

This movie is kinda more Murder Explanation than Murder Mystery, cutting off the whole first act (the part that should lay the story foundation and dynamically introduce these weirdo characters) and drowning the first sixty minutes in shot-reverse-shot dialogue as the characters sit around and discuss What's What -- before the plot wakes up around the movie's midpoint (but the camera doesn't; the movie spent most of its visual energy on the set and the costumes, which are awesome), but it still puts the actors to the test: the ones who can really make static dialogue sing (Ana de Armas, Toni Collette, Chris Evans, Natural Charisma Lakeith Stanfield, and especially Midlife Crisis Daniel Craig), and the ones who kinda struggle with it (Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis).

f96rg41,"The only thing I didn't super love is that Meg (the granddaughter) kind of didn't get a resolution the way the rest of the family did.
Specifically, it would have been nice to at least show her finding out her mother had been lying to her about being broke in order to make her go along with the family's coordinated assault on Marta, and while it's implied that unlike the rest she'll be fine since she didn't really care about the money anyway aside from being able to afford tuition, her getting an opportunity to make her mother Joni face up to the embezzlement and lying might have completed HER arc too (although for her, simply missing out on the inheritance with the implied future outing of her embezzlement as part of the airing of the details of the case leading to possible jailtime isn't UNsatisfying as it is). 

Meg didn't really do anything all that terrible compared to the rest of the family, which makes it feel a little irksome that she gets lumped in with them - although neither did Jacob except for him using his one opportunity to show the audience he's not a Nazi instead being used to spout Jim Crow-era miscegenation fearmongering. If she were secretly an asshole like the rest I'd have liked a little more demonstrating of that, or alternatively a little more conclusion to her arc in finding out she's been deceived to show her being more ethically separate from the rest of them. Walt also didn't act that terribly mostly, but he was by far the most moneygrubbing of them so him ending up with nothing like Harlan planned doesn't feel unsatisfying. Ransom and Richard's comeuppances are pretty reasonable and self-explanatory.

EDIT: And Harlan's mother getting nothing from the will feels a little weird, although with the ambiguous ending it's probably reasonable if one wanted to conclude that Marta would at least financially take care of Great Nana and possibly Meg (it's just, directly showing that would kind of deflate the awesome imagery at the very end, even if it's still implied anyway).",e21a17

f8xvlej,"I was a little disappointed. It was a well crafted film and I enjoyed the performances, but I feel it was let down by the pacing. The film almost treats the individual character's motives as exposition to be gotten out of the way with and tells you in no uncertain terms what the motivations of 3 out of the 4 suspects are. We're given no time to mull these motivations over before Rian shows us Marta's story, removing any doubt and explicitly telling us that Harlan committed suicide.

Of course, we learn late in the film that Harlan was essentially murdered. But I felt for a mystery film, it gave very few cues for us to come to this conclusion. The knowledge that there would be a late reveal or twist was only there because this is a film in the murder mystery genre and therefore the genre requires it. The film gets motive and method out of the way immediately. After that, we don't have any more mystery until the end of the second act of the film where Marta learns she has a blackmailer. The reveal was relatively satisfying, I just wish Rian had given us more hooks to consider those final questions relating to the blackmail and the arson.

Overall, I was really disappointed. I loved the performances but the plot didn't quite do it for me.",e21a17

f8xiptn,"This is a movie reddit will adore, but honestly, I was very disappointed with it. Chris Evans saves this movie from being skippable, with a little help from some of Craig's monologues.

It wastes the stacked cast entirely apart from Michael Shannon, not really giving any of them real moments to shine outside of the interviews at the beginning. But those were just to introduce them, none of them have any meaningful arcs or really interactions with Ransom, Marta, or Blanc. Which would be fine on it's own if the mystery aspect was enough to pique your interest and keep you on your toes throughout, but it just doesn't. I found myself waiting for the end any time Evans wasn't on screen, which is something I very rarely do while watching a movie. 

I physically cringed every time politics got brought up. Not only was the topic done poorly in general, but they got so specific with their references that in two years or less people will be scratching their heads wondering what the fuck they're even talking about. That on it's own would stop this movie from achieving greatness, and I don't understand how Johnson couldn't have at least taken that cue from Clue.

Now, the good. Again, Chris Evans. He is absolutely amazing in this role, showing off comedic and acting chops I thought he'd lost after being in the MCU for so long. He's hilarious, has depth to his portrayal, and hits all the right buttons to get you behind him until the end. Daniel Craig was good from a physical acting standpoint, but the accent was too much for most of the film, with the donut monologue being an obvious exception to this. The story itself was good at remaining unpredictable, but again, wasn't engaging enough as a viewer to hold my attention throughout. I'm not sure if this was an issue with the script or directing, but either way Johnson was at fault.

Personally, I'd give it a 5/10. Skippable if you aren't the type to appreciate a single great performance. Rewatching Clue is more worth your time",e21a17
fibadbw,"An average movie tbh.

If Blanc is such a good detective then he could have easily banked on Marta's puking condition to get the truth out in 30 seconds lol

f8uizuu,"There’s a lot to love about this but I think among my favorites is that virtually every actor in the film is playing against type. Shannon is the handicapped weasel, Evans the cocky asshole, Curtis as the ice queen, Collette as the aged out of touch socialite. It gave them all a wide open space to play around with audience expectations and that’s just what a whodunnit needs from its core cast. Even Johnson, who played around in something similar to Django Unchained and Eastbound and Down, added a degree of spinelessness that felt a far cry from the man synonymous with Miami Vice. 

Also, allowing Armas to play someone so vulnerable and not sexualized really showed off her chops and ability to carry a film beyond love interest or honey pots. 

Overall, the film is a lot of fun and that carries over from the infectiously entertaining performances. That Rian Johnson directed the heck out of it is just icing.",e21a17
fc2b7ji,"I was expecting a final twist at the end. We're told very early on that Martha is so incredibly intelligent and hard working. We're also told that she just cannot lie. I was expecting her to be the intentional murderer at the end and tell a bold face lie without vomiting, to reveal that she was the mastermind behind everything and that her persona of a caring, naive nurse was just an act to fool everyone, including Harlan, into giving Martha the money. We're told that she was always better than Ransom at Go. If Ransom was able to think that far ahead in his plan, shouldn't Martha be able to think one step ahead of Ransom?

That's what I'm going with. Martha is the mastermind behind everything. Cool. Calculated. Intelligent.",e21a17
fc3pjmh,"Marta: Not a very good nurse.  Also not very good at math.

When  she holds up the vials, we get a couple close-ups with the medication  concentrations: morphine 5mg/mL, ketorolac 30mg/mL (by the way, they  spelled ""ketorolac"" wrong, as ""ketorlac"").  If she were intending on  giving 100mg of Toradol (which is a lot, usual dose is 15 or 30mg), it  would only be 3.33mL.  3.33mL from the morphine vial would be \~17g of  morphine — not nearly as much as ""100 milligrams of the good stuff"".   Furthermore, she's using what looks like a 5mL syringe, so there's no  way that he could've gotten 100mg of morphine during a single injection.  

Also, with IV morphine, the user should feel the effects right  away, especially with a larger dose.  It's not like 0–9:59 → fine, don't  feel it at all; 10:00 → dead.  

Although the lack of symptoms  could be explained by the vials being switched, the dosing wonkiness  causes some ambiguity whether this is an intentional omission for the  sake of the plot.  With the clarity with which we're shown the dosages, I  thought for sure this would be significant.  I guess not.

fc2c2tt,"I realize I’m quite late to the party. But I truly feel as though this was a perfect movie. I keep trying to find anything wrong with it and I just... can’t.

For context, *In Bruges* is my favorite film. I could wax on as to the reasons why but the long and short of it is that every single line of dialogue in that film, every set piece, everything you would at a glance dismiss as being irrelevant comes back in some kind of meaningful way in the end. THAT to me is the definition of a tightly written script. (It’s well acted too, but that’s a secondary point.)

The script for *Knives Out* is the next best that I’ve encountered. It’s the first film that’s made me question my allegiance to *In Bruges* as an unequivocal favorite because it checks all of the same boxes.

All the way through I was on the edge of my seat trying to formulate in my head what the total picture could be and I wasn’t able to until it was thrust in my face. Much the same way, every single line of dialogue went un-wasted. The script was perfect. The acting was sublime.

Having had a full 24 hours to digest and try to find any fault with the movie, I’m not ashamed to say that I have to place it in my top 5 films of all time.

I think Marta did it.  2 things - 1) the comment about her always beating that guy at the game.  She blows it off about her making a pattern or something - but I don't buy it.   I think she is smart - smarter than Hugh - smarter than the old man - smarter than the detective.  That point Ransom made about it was too thick... I think she knew she was getting the inheritance - the old dude told her everything!  2) the blood on her shoe. People think it splattered all the way over from the old guy.  BS I say.  I think her whole story is BS.  Kind of like Kaiser Soze - at the very end of that movie you realize the whole story he told, the whole dang movie, was made up and crap.  Heck - Daniel Craig was basically impersonating Kevin Spacey like Frank Underwood the whole movie - an homage maybe?   Everything about her was a setup - the puke thing is perfect to lure people into believing everything she wants them too - by making them think they can tell 100% when she is lying...  She has people wrapped around her fingers.  That last look from Ransom, her on the balcony - was a realization the she won.

I wish it was it had less topical one liners because these current topics get outdated fast and this really feels like it could be a cult classic. Hollywood should get this in their heads- current affairs shit get outdated, STOP IT. Keep it timeless, so new movies can become classics. None of their little quips affected their storylines very much, I thought the alt right troll would have more of a bearing on the story considering the set up but he was really just there as a 1 dimensional character and was the weakest character by far. Could have replaced him with a hippie vegan and it would have 0 bearing on the story. In the end it didn’t even matter because all the characters in the family were equally shitty.

Marta would then be in all the jeopardy Harlan had predicted. However, Harlan being a murder mystery writer would had to have known that his suicide would have been under suspicious circumstances and that an autopsy would be conducted and, ipso facto, a toxicology draw would as well. Therefore, Harlan committing suicide did nothing but slow down the inevitable revelation of Marta's supposed mistake. Isn't it the case that when someone commits suicide and they're considered *mens sana in corpore sano* then their death will lead to an autopsy? Consider if a person falls from a great height and the family believes it to be an accident- a toxicology report might be requested to see if drugs or alcohol were at play.!<",e21a17

Color me surprised!

I thought Parasite would have no competition for the best movie of 2019 but ""Knives Out"" looks to prove me wrong. Rian Johnson has found his niche in the ""Who Dun it"" genre of films. Maybe The Last Jedi was a fluke due to improper planning from Lucasfilm executives but Knives Out shows that the man knows how to direct.

""Knives Out"" is about a small wealthy right-leaning family and the patriarch's nurse navigating their way through a police investigation over the patriarch's apparent suicide. It's a mystery film that gives away the answer while slowly revealing the context to the audience. Johnson is extremely meticulous in the film while being humorous simultaneously. The entire film provides an entertaining experience. 

With such a spectacular cast, it's hard to distinguish any true breakouts. Daniel Craig shows off his acquired Kentucky accent as Detective Blanc but his extravagant performance is balanced off nicely with Ana de Armas' portrayal as desperate but kind nurse Marta. Both carry the film as none of the other big names, including Captain America, has enough time to shine but each does stand out individually. 

Rian Johnson's directing greatly differs from the 2017 tentpole film. His mixture of humor and tension blends together well. Not to mention that the closeups in certain scenes make the film more immersive. The cinematography and score were good too. 

Overall, this film is a must see for anyone looking for a good time at the theatre. See it at least twice.

* Who names their child ""Ransom""?

That being said, I already vented and wrote down all my nitpicky notes of why I didn't like the movie/what I felt didn't work, and I don't mean to disparage anyone that enjoyed the movie, the below notes are just what I felt and I'm totally open to discussion.

Overall, I have this ongoing bad habit of sometimes going into movies with certain expectations and when they aren't met, I can get really upset. I'm still trying to learn to go into movies with an open mind and let it guide me instead of having my preconceptions cloud my judgement.

>!· the performances were great, cinematography was great, there was cool play with light and shadow, score was alright, nice B-roll shots, technically a great movie.!<

>!· The trailers portray the movie as a classic Agatha Christie whodunit. We have a murder, a gallery of colorful suspects, an insightful detective, an old house full of secrets, a nice “cozy”. However, it becomes almost immediately apparent that the movie isn’t a whodunit once, very early on, we are spoiled to nearly the entire story of how the murder occurred. Therefore, the majority of the movie is no longer about “whodunit”, but rather “will the known ‘murderer’ get away with it”. It would have been an interesting take if both the plot and the main character/murderer in question didn’t have so much working against it.!<

>!· Marta is a bland, uninteresting character compared to everyone else. Detective Le Blanc is a funny, insightful detective with a southern drawl. Linda is a witty, sharp woman who refuses to be stepped on by the police or her own family. Morris is a scheming, lying, insensitive rich jerk who openly talks smack about others but has his own skeletons as well. On the other hand, Marta doesn’t have much of a personality – she’s kind, physically unable to lie, hardworking, and skilled at “Go” but that’s about it. Furthermore, she lacks autonomy. Most of her actions are not from her own discretion but rather instructed by someone else. The entire plan of covering up the crime was laid out by Harlan. Ransom leads Marta around after she’s named the heir. Detective LeBlanc stops her from admitting her crime and is also the one that unravels the case. Marta’s only true actions are tampering with the evidence of her involvement (her muddy tracks, the VHS tape) but her motivations for those actions are also problematic.!<

>!· I have no reason to root for Marta to get away with her supposed crime. Even if the “murder” was unintentional and was caused by improper medical treatment, we the audience and she knows that she is still guilty but actively avoids accepting responsibility. If it was clearer earlier on that she was framed with the vials being switched, then I’d have reason to root for her as she actively pursues the truth and clears her name. As it is, however, her actions are influenced by irresponsibility and avoiding the truth, motives which make me lose respect for her.!<

>!o Furthermore, Marta has no solid reason to betray/keep the inheritance from the family. Walt and Meg already promised to take care of her even before the will was read, showing their compassion – Marta was going to be secure either way. It would be understandable if the family never liked Marta and were planning to boot her as soon as they no longer needed her services, which is why Marta refuses to relinquish the fortune. However, there’s no reason for Marta to clutch so tightly onto their inheritance other than anxiety once everyone lashes out at her.!<

>!§ On a sidenote, Marta didn’t feel fully deserving of the full inheritance as her relationship with Harlan wasn’t developed enough. Sure she gave him company, joked around, and played games with him, but we don’t see enough to see how deep their friendship went compared to Walt and Thao’s relationship in Gran Torino.!<

>!o On another sidenote, Harlan is an 85-year-old mystery author, how has he not written about medical malpractice nor knows about the effects of overdose? Furthermore, he and Marta were talking for long enough for the effects of the supposed morphine to kick in, wouldn’t he have felt “Hey, wait a sec, I feel totally fine. Why am I not high of my balls right now?” (I’ll come back to this later)!<

>!· Ransom was already guaranteed his cut of the fortune by helping Marta, why did he still feel the need to blackmail her? Was he greedy enough to go after the entire fortune? If Ransom didn’t blackmail Marta, Harlan’s death would have eventually been ruled suicide, Ransom could discreetly kill/dispose of Fran’s body/toxicology evidence, gotten his cut of the fortune and gotten away with his attempted murder. Ransom’s nail in the coffin was Marta discovering Fran, but if he never sent the blackmail letter, Fran’s involvement would have never been found.!<

>!o On a side note, Fran confronts a known murderer but goes to the rendezvous unarmed?!<

>!· We establish that an overdose of morphine would kill a person in 10 minutes. Ransom injects Fran with the morphine at 8am, but is somehow still alive two hours later once Marta finds her at 10am.!<

>!o On a side note, if Fran survived past the initial 10 minutes for another two hours, wouldn’t Harlan have more time to be saved?!<

>!· The Thrombey family advertised on the poster is almost completely absent from the entire second half of the movie. While confronting the lawyer, Joni brings up the Slayer Rule and it seems that the family will gang up and conduct their own investigation to incriminate Marta, but no, they’re largely inactive. Meg calls Marta and Walt awkwardly confronts her at her home, but that’s about all they do. Despite having a great cast and colorful characters, they’re largely underused.!<

>!· Why didn’t the investigators wait for the coroner’s/medical examiner’s report before starting their case? The first thing that came to my mind when Harlan was poisoned was “the truth will be in the inevitable toxicology report”. If the detectives waited until all the established evidence came in before launching their case, not only would Ransom not have the opportunity to expect something had gone wrong and made efforts to cover his tracks, Marta would have been instantly cleared.!<

>!· Detective LeBlanc is an inconsistent character. Early in the movie we establish his perceptiveness. He’s able to effectively interrogate and deduce that all his witnesses are lying and exactly what they’re lying about. He’s able to press Marta for confirmation of his suspicions and get his answers. But then he turns into an idiot. After a damningly suspicious car chase and Marta painting herself as a key suspect, LeBlanc willingly allows Marta to make a suspicious stop completely unaccompanied while he twiddles his thumbs in the car?!<",e21a17
f94fiju,"Little bit of Star Wars dead horse beating ahead so fair warning, but as someone who felt frustrated with TLJ but enjoyed Looper, this basically confirmed what I think about Johnson which is that I think he's a damn good storyteller but was just wrong for Star Wars. Here, it feels like he's completely at the top of his game with a project that's perfect for him. Wasn't bored for a minute and found the twists to make me legitimately more interested. My only complaint is that I feel like they kind of spent a lot of time building up the first few family members but ultimately didn't flesh them out much. This is really Marta's story, which is fine, because she's great, but I think giving them a little more time to breathe could've helped the whole thing come together. 

As is, it's a really entertaining little mystery that feels really tightly knit and satisfying.",e21a17
f9eudzs,"Sorry everyone, it seems I'm in the minority here. I think this movie is seriously overrated.

The first half is good. Everyone in the ensemble does a great job and the set up makes things appear real intricate. Then they reveal the story of the guy's death and it all falls apart.

Once they show that he did indeed slit his own throat it's fairly obvious that someone had switched the vials, especially because they made such a point of the overdose-fixer being missing. It becomes even more obvious as the script spends another 30 minutes trying to ignore the prospect of a toxicology report. This deflated a lot of Ana de Armas' scenes when she was trying to cover up her tracks, because you know she wasn't the true culprit and that she would ultimately be safe. So by this point a lot of the tension's gone, and the only interesting part is trying to figure out who switched the vials. Then they introduce Chris Evans and... he's immediately desperate to help her out, feeding her all sorts of orders to get her to behave exactly as he needs, remembering addresses too well, confessing to everything too soon. I don't know if the idea was to make him so obvious a red herring that we couldn't possibly believe it was him but... well, obviously it was him, and we're left with no mystery at all. Even with the damn letter to Jamie Lee Curtis the gut reaction when you see it's blank is 'Oh. Invisible Ink.'

So it fails as a mystery movie for me because they strip away a lot of tension and mystery way too soon. The other problem for me is the writing.

Almost everyone in the family falls by the wayside in the movie and your mind after they show it was indeed a suicide, and especially after Chris Evans rolls up; only Michael Shannon is left with an interesting scene. Some of the dialogue coming out of people's mouths is strange (for example, Ana de Armas' first phone call is awkward, the teen sparring with cookie cutter phrases, the cop's cringe-inducing weaksauce drops). They also beat you over the head a bit too much (did you guys realize Ana de Armas was a *good* person? Did you remember that by the fourth time they mentioned it?). Thankfully this isn't a constant problem, so aside from parts here and there (my theater was laughing at the whole 'you'/'Hugh' debacle), the all-star cast handles what they're given well.

I would call this movie pretty good if it hadn't bent over backwards to fight the genre it's supposed to be part of. As it stands it's just okay; solid performances, especially Ana de Armas, coupled with a script that needed more work. Frankly, I think the Ana as the Mastermind theory is just people trying to give this movie more credit than it deserves.",e21a17
f8uvpxp,"I'm sure this will be lost in the shuffle, and that's fine. I'm sure the movie was probably good too, and that's fine. If you're reading this, just stop and ignore it, I'm writing it more for me than anything. I have no proof or evidence, so I have no means of convincing anyone. But something about this movie was just way too clear to me. It might be that I'm a huge Agatha Christie reader. I took notes of when I thought something was true as I watched the film, and this is the first time I've ever done that for any movie I've ever seen. I was just that confident from super early on that I understood what was going to happen. 

Basically every single major reveal in the movie I predicted an hour before it happened. And I don't even know how to phrase this without sounding like I'm bragging, except to say that this is not something that I normally do and it's not meant to be a brag. I'm not the fake-genius who says he picks out every plot of every movie. I'm right and wrong probably a normal amount. But this movie specifically stands out as something that I guessed extremely accurately and quickly. 

Spoilers from here on out. 

What felt like 30 seconds into the movie I knew who the ""killer"" was (though what I didn't know yet was the reasoning and that it was an accident, or that it would be revealed relatively soon in the movie). Technically at this point I was actually wrong too, but since it was a minute in and I was just starting to form my basic picture of the movie, I still think it was basically a predictor of what was to come. I can pinpoint the exact minute that I guessed who ""killed"" him, it was when Marta's sister was watching her fake mystery TV show and they basically introduced Marta. Not sure exactly why I immediately thought ""well she's the killer"", but at the time I will admit that I thought she was more devious and intentional a killer, and so was only really right on a technicality. 

When they introduced Harlan later I immediately thought he killed himself, though my main reasoning was that he was a mystery author and that he would like to set something like this up. The fact that he coincidentally cut ties with all his family at that point seemed like even more evidence to me, though as I said I'll admit again this basically turned out to be right for the wrong reasons. 

At this point we're basically shown the actual murder, and while I'm technically right, it's not for the reasons I thought. She did kill him, he did commit suicide. So while watching at this point, I'm basically thinking ""well, everything's going as I expected, but not for the right reasons, so a good enough twist and explanation from here could make the whole movie.""

Unfortunately basically from this point I'm never surprised again. That someone else mixed up the drugs seemed obvious; the fact that the cure coincidentally was missing made it pretty clear someone was involved, and no one seemed smart enough to have done it except Chris Evans. When I thought about his argument with his dad I figured that he might have planned something along these lines. When he waved her into his car I was almost positive he was guilty, especially when he's then presented as some savior. When he brought up Go and that he could beat his dad but she was apparently better I thought it was obvious. From that point, I had no doubt. I knew then that he was a mastermind, Go was brought up to show that he was that kind of devious thinker, everything else I may not have known the exact details of, but to me it was pretty obvious that he set this up by switching the drugs, Marta accidentally killed Harlan, and that Harlan thought it was an accident so he killed himself. 

From here on there's still a lot of movie left, which was pretty boring when it's already clear what will happen. They go to the diner and Ransom slowly wins her over, there's a lot of mystery solving where it's extremely obvious to anyone who's ever read any Poirot novel that Blanc already suspects everything, and one obvious event after another just continues to confirm suspicions. 

Honestly I think the majority of these things I just guessed because they either seem or straight up are Agatha Christie plots. It's especially clear if you think of Blanc as Poirot (even his french sounding name is clearly meant to be an homage). His entire interaction with Marta felt like The Murder of Roger Acroyd (where he basically knows what's happening but lets the parties convict themselves), but then when her part is revealed it becomes clear that there must be more to the story or the movie would be very boring. So all plot points from there on are based on the idea that in the end, it will turn out he knew everything all along and that he was always a step ahead. I guess here again you could claim I was only half right, since he did know basically everything all along, including Marta's part, but he didn't have the toxicology report and its repercussions until the last minute. So I guess he didn't have the full picture, even if he basically did. 

I guess this is more a cathartic rant I'm making than anything. I've read a million random posts like this where someone's just crowing about how smart they are. All I can say again is that that isn't my intention, that I'm not trying to brag or show off. I just legitimately wasn't surprised by a single thing for this entire 2+ hour movie, and I'm disappointed because I was so excited. I'm a big fan of Rian Johnson and have been since Brick, which I legitimately love.",e21a17
fkk5sl3,"Have to say, I thought this was a pretty mediocre movie at best, and don’t really understand the scores it’s getting. 



I was initially interested in the first part of the film because I thought it was good premise to just show the interviews and let the viewer put things together, but they ditched that idea immediately with highly detailed flashbacks. How is a mystery supposed to be thrilling if you know the answer?



And I thought the acting was straight up terrible. The only interesting character was the black policeman. Everyone else was just pure trope. Worst offender being the main actress, whose face seems to be purely ornamental and a vehicle for different degrees of pouted lips. 



Also can we take a moment to laugh at Daniel Craig’s accent? It sounds like they briefly mentioned that he should have a southern accent 10 minutes before filming started. I’m not even American and I was cringing the whole time",e21a17

f9kuw3m,"Why wouldn't Harlan Thrombey just stage his suicide to look like an intentional morphine overdose? Cutting his throat was needlessly violent and only raised suspicion that he was murdered, which he had no intention of doing. He even had enough time to write a suicide note and sign it. For someone with as much knowledge of murder investigations as a famous author like him must have had, he made some really stupid choices.

Other than that, I thought the movie was easily an 8 or 9 out of 10.",e21a17
fb2jl3p,"I'm at a loss as to all the praise this movie is getting. It's been advertised as a who done it with a stellar cast but it's something completely different. Within the first half hour we find out what happened, and then there is no hint that there is a deeper mystery until the last half hour. Instead we get to watch Ana de Armas' character try to cover up what happened for two hours. This wouldn't be such a problem if they gave her character a personality, and had her go about the coverup in a clever and interesting way. But instead she sort of passively goes with the flow and does such interesting and memorable actions as walking on muddy path, throwing a stick, and ejecting a VHS tape.  The famous actors are given very little to do. Even Craig whose Southern accent is the highlight of the film doesn't do much more than babble on and on, though at least that was semi entertaining. Having just seen Parasite last week, a film that deals with similar themes of class divide in an intelligent in nuanced way, the social commentary in this film came across as hackneyed and cartoonist. 

As an aside I know we are supposed to sympathize with Marta, the film literally tells you she is a good person, but as someone who worked in the elder care industry for a time, part of your job, especially if you are a nurse is to prevent them from committing self harm. She watched the person in her care commit suicide, and didn't attempt to give any aid, or call 911. At the very least she was grossly negligent. If the family sued she would 100% be found culpable in his death.

On a positive note there were some scenes that were well shot from a visual perspective. I'm not done with Rain Johnson as a director, but I'm not going to see anything he had a hand in writing.",e21a17

I think it's creative that we see his death scene so soon, how well all the details fit together, etc. But I was just kinda letting the mystery wash over me as time passed, I didn't find myself anxiously wondering what would happen next because it was so obvious when the movie was trying to manipulate you/fool you.

f990zxk,"I've got mixed feelings about this one, and I'm not 100% what to think about it. I liked it, I know I did. It was a fun little murder mystery and I admittedly did not guess the ending, but I wasn't able to fall in love with it.  Johnson does a good job subverting the murder mystery formula, but I kind of feel robbed. There were many red herrings, and there were a few obvious clues, but I didn't feel like I was given enough information to solve the puzzle myself, and when it all came together it felt like it was reaching from time to time. I also didn’t find the suspects very suspicious. Outside of Harlan, Ransom, and maybe Marta, I didn’t believe any of the other characters were legitimate suspects. I also wasn't sure what to make of Craig. Was he a bumbling moron who accidentally solved mysteries or was he an investigative genius? I think his character was inconsistent. I also would have liked the movie to be a little bit funnier. There are some good laughs, but I think it could have had more.  


Now, with that said, I still liked it, and it made me want to go back and watch some old Poirot movies, but I didn't like it as much as the hype suggested. Compared to kinda similar movies from this year, Parasite and Ready or Not, I would rank this third. 7.5/10",e21a17
f9oazgz,"Basically, Murder of Roger Ackroyd + Hercule Poirot's Christmas + some clever modern writing and commentary.
  
It's a pretty good film if you look at it as a family drama. In terms of actual mystery elements, it kinda let me down. Mainly because it borrows a lot of it's setting and schemes from the two Poirot stories, and it wasn't really engaging or captivating as a murder mystery apart from the interrogations at the beginning.
  
The ""twists"" at the end felt like the writers trying to give Marta a happy ending, and not like something that believably happened in the story. The whole ""Ransom was behind everything and the medicine was double switched"" didn't make me go ""Ohhh shit so THAT'S what actually happened!"". Instead I just thought ""Oh ok"".
  
All being said, the movie is an absolute blast to watch and I had a great time from the beginning to the end. Would definitely reccomend watching it.

fghgq73,"I was rather bored during it. Fairly predictable if you are familiar with this type of films, and most characters are more like two or three reddit posts rather than a human. Far too many conveniences for me to feel any satisfaction from the 'mystery', even had it been surprising.

It's strength would be the interaction of the kind of ensemble class, but I was a bit disappointed to not see them flex their acting abilities much. Also as always Rian Johnson has beautiful cinematography.

I think at points it was trying to be a comedy but the jokes didn't work for me.",e21a17
fgtghpm,"Knives Out - A conspiracy theory

Spoilers follow, obviously. So I just finished watching knives out, and thought of the following scenario on the way home:

The entire movie is a lie told from the perspective of Marta. Imagine for a second that Marta knew about Harlan’s will, which is not too ridiculous as he trusted her. She proceeds to overdose Harlan on purpose, choosing the day of the party to maximise the number of suspects. She knows, however, that she will be the prime suspect once the will is read out and the entire family will try to ensure that she is caught. 

So here’s what she does: She collides with a brilliant but corrupt detective (Blanc) to frame Ransom. Ransom never hired Blanc, Marta hires him and promises him a share of the inheritance in exchange for his help. This is why there is no bank trail of the payment. He involves her in every step of the investigation, allows her to destroy all evidence against her (the footsteps, the video tape etc). This same evidence would have exonerated Ransom. The local detectives are too in awe of him to challenge or question him (as seen multiple times in the movie), and he fails to point out evidence against Marta such as the blood on her shoes or the broken wooden ledge to the police. Marta burns down the lab on purpose, knowing that Ransom will be blamed for it. The house help found out about this (either because the help knew about the will too, or because she saw her messing with the medicine bag after Harlan’s death) - remember that Ransom was not the only person missing from the funeral, Marta wasn’t there either! So she murders her using the same morphine overdose technique and blames all of it on Ransom, while using the note as a convenient excuse for why she was at the murder location.

When Harlan tells Ransom that Marta is better than him at Go, he may be trying to hint that Marta is a better strategist who will outthink him. Marta pretends to be not very smart, and the whole vomit thing is a lie - she sometimes vomited instantly, but can hold it for a few minutes when it is convenient for her to do so (like at the end of the movie). The family only found out about her vomit thing recently during a game of Mafia, so it is likely she made it up when planning the murder. Note that Blanc never once asks her if she killed Harlan, but only asks questions that allow her to be vague but truthful, trying to make sure the detectives are convinced of her innocence.

When Ransom is confronted with all of this, he is understandably angry and confused, which is why he says the best they have on him is attempted murder - he knows there’s no evidence because he did nothing wrong, and the confession was made in anger. The recording angers him further, and he tried to kill Marta to save his family, but that is the final nail in his coffin and the detectives are now fully convinced that he’s the murderer.

What is the actual evidence against Ransom, except for Marta and Blanc’s testimony? No footsteps, no videotape, no evidence of the arson, the unreliable testimony of the old woman, and a confession under duress. Oh, and the report from the lab - that’s obviously fake, and no one can verify whether it is real because the lab conveniently burned down.",e21a17
fiw1kgr,"So I'm a little late, but I wanted to get this thought in before the thread closes. It's a pretty good movie, for the most part, but with a huge central flaw.

The problem with the film is the same issue Rian seems to always have- he has a good story, but he is so preoccupied, so consumed, his mind so poisoned with needing to be progressive and shout about something unrelated to the basic plot, that he lets it get in the way of competent narrative structure. In this case, that Marta the poor undocumented immigrant is pure of heart and that's what helps her 'win.' This is at odds with most of the plot and laying out the mystery, but what I see as the mistake of the film as a whole is this takes away the entire mystery aspect.

If this was a book, Marta's experience with Harlan would come out near the end, and then the reveal of the final twist would happen after that, making it a double whammy. But in order to get to that point Marta would have to appear duplicitous and suspect as much as everyone else for the rest of the story, which Rian wants to avoid at all costs. She is the protagonist, but because he wants it both ways I guess Blanc is also, and as a matter of fact all the other suspects besides the actual ""killer"" fall by the wayside, so their inclusion is almost unnecessary at all after the first hour besides comedy relief.

What happens instead is, at the expense of the suspense and even the entire mystery, Marta switching the vials and Harlan killing himself is revealed almost at the outset. This is all well and good... but then so far as the audience knows, there's no mystery. If we believe this version as truth, there's no suspenseful propulsion, and the movie becomes about just following Marta around as she tries to get away with it. But here's the main issue... even that is undone, becuase Rian wants us firmly on her side without telling us why. Because she's put upon? As far as we know, she ""killed"" Harlan, and rather than allowing us to root for this liar's downfall, we are supposed to root FOR her, to the point where Harlan's reaction is so inexplicable that we think there has to be more to it (and there wasn't, that part is face value).

So when the twist comes at the end, it is unearned. But it's unearned because it's just a reshaping of prior events that does not change who the prior culprit is. It is so flawed in fact that Rian has to set up another death (Fran) to make the ""killer"" actually guilty of something worth imprisonment, which is even mildly addressed in the dialogue and then breezed past so not to appear as a flaw. But the movie plot has no shape, and most definitely is not a mystery. It has clues, sure, but when we have no idea there's a mystery left to be solved other than there's a lot of running time left, it's a cheat.

I get that Rian wanted to make a movie about class inequality, and then call it a mystery anyway. That's well and good but it is so unfair for the movie's supporters to say we the audience are to blame for expecting a traditional locked door thriller, since that's what the movie was sold as and what any traditional ""mystery"" offers. So you feel justifiably ripped off for paying the admission price if you didn't want to hear Rian wax about Immigration and the plight of Marta, whose actions did result in Harlan's death, no matter which way you slice it. Saying someone else is to blame does not change the fact that she administered the vials and didn't try to call an ambulance despite his protests. Any argument about that is just semantics to defend her character. 

It was the same issue with The Last Jedi, where he wants you to be on board with his politics rather than educating the audience from a starting point of neutrality, so when he throws in jokes and shocks, the audience that is not already on his side and doesn't appreciate being lectured to, is put off. There's a case to be made for a good social message, but he lays it on so thick and does not try to accept anyone in the audience might start from a place of disagreement, that he throws the basic structure overboard and undercuts himself in pursuit of this message. Anyway, my two cents.",e21a17

Jesus F. Christ, I can't remember when was the last time I had so much fun watching the movie. So much diversity in character, holy hell. Every single person on the screen played different role. Every single person on the screen was unique.

f92dpr0,"Enjoyed the movie but I stand by my original comment that the initial Twitter praise for it when it premiered earlier this year was definitely more orchestral than genuine.  A good 90% of the reviews had the same buzz words and same type of praise just rearranged to not sound too identical.

Again, I enjoyed the movie and am generally a Rian Johnson fan but this definitely was over praised.  Acting was great, pacing well done for the most part, and cinematography executed nicely.  

But, it isn't a full on whodunit film.  It leans on that early on then it veers away from that.  You're not really getting into a ""I think this person did it"" after about 45min.  You're basically just wondering if the ""twist"" is going to be seen through all the way or if there is a detail missing or overlooked. 

Essentially when the final reveal happens, a lot of stuff that ties it together is presented on the spot and was never subtlety presented earlier in the plot. Also, there is not a much comedic moments as those earlier reviews suggested.  It spends more time being surgical vs comedic.

With that said, it's still a fun movie and definitely worth the watch but it's not some game changer that some will try to convince you it is.",e21a17
f9f3hra,"To be honest- I walked in with high expectations, and walked out disappointed. 

It was pitched as a murder mystery, and the murder aspect was revealed to us within the first 1/4 of the movie. The mystery aspect was ok and somewhat entertaining, but the pacing just felt inconsistent throughout the entire film. Was also a little taken off by the political humor that didn't really feel necessary- (funny yes, but not tonally where the rest of the film was at). 

It was a decent film overall, but honestly I wish I could've seen it as a Matinee, rather than a night showing.

But the movie’s doughnut hole is that it can’t quite decide if it wants to be a funny murder mystery or a commentary on immigration in America.

f9vkloz,"Considering how crucial it was to the entire story, I think the film did quite a poor job of showing why Harlan cared for Marta so much.

They have one scene together, and it starts with her telling him to go to bed after he requests that they play a board game on his birthday. He has to ask her 3 times before she accepts. Then they have a mostly one-sided conversation. It felt like she didn't really wanna be there. 

Perhaps this was intentional. When discussing the will later on, she mentions that Harlan's decision could be more to do with how much he disliked his family, than it was about her. Still though, the idea that a kind heart allowed her to succeed didn't feel entirely justified.",e21a17

But I ended up not caring about the core mystery at all; I thought it had a great cast but most of them are underused; I didn't like any of the characters; I didn't find it as funny as apparently everybody else did.

Also before anyone accuses me of being anti-Rian Johnson, please know that The Last Jedi is one of my two favourite Star Wars films, so that has NOTHING to do with this.

Also, the overlying theme of immigrant politics was something that should be left in 2016, but I guess the movie was formulated in the buzzing Trump era.

Obviously it’s very different from Star Wars but that exists within someone else’s franchise. The ability to craft 2 incredibly distinct and distinctly entertaining movies highlights Johnson’s talent- most directors would be lucky to have made even one movie as uniquely brilliant. And that’s to say nothing of The Brother’s Bloom (which this movie did remind me of in positive ways, from the tone to the cleverness to the music) and Brick, both good movies in their own right.

was hoping for a third act turn where marta is revealed as the mastermind. i thought the flashbacks to her conversations with harlan on the patio where he keeps reiterating, ""like you told me to"" were a subtle nod to her mischievousness. it felt a litle anticlimactic that the biggest POS in the movie was the villain, but, it's honestly a small quibble given how much i enjoyed it.

It feels a little *safe* if that makes sense, like it didn't go as far as I was expecting and it wasn't as intense as I thought it would go. I thought the mystery would be a bit more elaborate (even though yes it is very elaborate). Something along the lines of Harlan faking his own death or maybe the whole thing being an elaborate ruse to suss out Marta ""becoming part of the family"" because they've all been raised around a mystery writer. 

Like the things that I enjoyed about this movie like the campiness, exploring the characters, building the world were all things, Daniel Craig's accent, were all set to about a 4 when I kind of expected an 8 or even 11. I think a good example of this was the window. Why show **one** hidden entrance rather than a bunch? *Especially since the family stayed in the house for multiple scenes!* It would have been so funny to have a scene with two people bumping into each other or to have a shot of them all sneaking around to show the depravity of the family members. Like this was great but it felt more like an episode of a mystery series about Blanc than a fully fledged movie. This cast is amazing and I wish that we got more from them rather than what felt like a very brief glimpse into this life.",e21a17
f8x8qoc,"That was an epic way for Rian Johnson to tell all the toxic entitles fans who accused him of killing star wars “you’ve done that yourself,” and he did the movie the way he thought was best every step of the way and he’s not sorry for it... all while mixing plenty of social commentary on the divisiveness of American culture.

I say this because I heard that in an interview, the public backlash from Last Jedi was the inspiration for this movie. 

I could be looking at it all wrong though.

LOVED the fuck outta this movie, Daniel Craig, Ana De Armas, Michael Shannon, Chris Evans and Toni Collette were all standouts but really the entire cast was great. I will say I kinda wish they gave Jordan Lieberher a bit more to do because he is a find actor and they really only used him for one joke. Loved the ending, loved that they revealed the actual murder in the first act and the rest of the movie was us trying to find out who was out to get Ana de Armas’ character and I will admit Chris Evans being the “malicious” character was a bit surprising and I love love LOVED the bit with the fake knife because I do Murder mystery theater for a living and we use those for our shows so my crew and I had a hearty chortle at that.

I mean, it was absurdly predictable, Im genuinely shocked at all the people I see saying it was so twisty and unpredictable. I thought Chris Evans being the villain was pretty obvious from really early on... I kept waiting and waiting for a big twist and it just felt like it never came. Its like the obvious most simple answer ended up being right, the guy that felt the most villainous shockingly... was the villain? Ok I guess; A fun ride but a pretty predictable whodunit. The characters and performances really carry the film, but I wish the writing was a bit smarter and that it had a more clever ending.

It would have been mindblowing if all the dominoes fell in her favor and the whole plot was thought out by her and her alone.

Like I get that he's an anachronistic Agatha-Christic wacky cartoon character, but am I the only one that thought the accent was terrible? Maybe it's just because I'm from Louisiana and I've visited Kentucky and many other parts of the South, but literally no one talks like that. Why couldn't he have just been British? Was it supposed to be a [Transatlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_accent) parody?

f9c97q9,"There’s 2 things that bothered me about this movie:

1. 100mg if Morphine would most certainly kill Harlan quicker than 10 minutes (my mom’s a retired EMT so she explained it to me)

2. They called Jacob an alt-right Nazi troll, but nothing about his character showed that he was any of that. He was literally on his phone the whole time, and we didn’t even get to see what he was looking it. Didn’t buy that he was an alt right troll Nazi just because other characters said so and just because he’s a white male.

That whole political discussion scene was WAY too realistic. That’s the point, but damn did it make me think of my past family times where politics came up.

fa6p8vs,"Did anyone feel like the movie wasted its opportunity of having an excellent subversion of expectations? 

The trailers made it look like a whodunnit, the opening perfectly set it up to be a whodunnit,  then we find out Marta committed manslaughter and it was Harlan's wish for her to get away with it. This was a fantastic twist that had me on the edge of my seat.

It felt pretty shoehorned to revert the movie to a whodunnit in the third act, especially since Ransom was the obvious choice (had we not known Marta's testimony). I feel like Rian Johnson wasted an opportunity to give us a whodunnit where no one was a murderer, and Marta weaseled out manslaughter charges by Detective Blanc. I feel like that would have been a more entertaining ending.",e21a17
fcivnws,"So this is driving me crazy. I think a lot of people are watching the movie too literally and missing the real villain. This is going to be a bit all over the place. I've seen the movie once and it's late.\*Spoilers\*Look at this scene.""Can I ask, when did you know I had something to do with Harlands Death?""""Oh, from the first moment you set foot in front of me"" - points at the blood on her shoe""Oh, shit..."" - Looks at her shoes worried

""I want you to remember something that's very important, you won not by playing the game Harlands way but yours...""This is the detective acknowledging her game, one he saw. She was worried he found her out here at the end of the movie.

Now look back. Maybe re-watch the movie and imagine Marta is lying the whole time, having you see what she wants you to see. - Right before dying Marta asks Harland how things went, he says he told them all they've been cut off and then later also credits her with the suggestion of doing so, to all of them. Perfect time to kill him. She is in the will, the family have been cut off, and potentially she is aware of what Ransom has done, if he did it at all.

\- The girl the son-in-law was cheating on has the exact same coat Marta is wearing in most of her scenes, most notably walking around the garden with the cops and detective. It's the same color, the same hood and lining, also the same hair color. Either it's been photoshopped or she was playing the son in law. This was also the first vomit, when the detective asked if Richard was having an affair (With her).

\- In the flashback scene with Harland showing Marta the pictures of Richard cheating, potentially with her, this could have been him confronting her. She also could have been the one to send him the email. I believe this was a confrontation and the reason Harland didn't reveal the full details of the affair to His daughter, to protect Marta. Possibly, Harland was going to dump Marta too.  Or possibly she was using the affair to drive a wedge between the family and Harlan, possibly saying Richard pressured her?  Maybe he didn't realise it was her...but I think it's important that the scene is cut off there.

\- I think the coat Marta is wearing is a symbol for scenes where Marta is gaming the family or covering up her guilt. I actually think the clothing Marta wears is a motif in many scenes, like when her and Ransom go off and eat together they are essentially facing off, starting with different coats, his bold and outgoing hers blending. But when they are eating they are both wearing the same type of jersey. I think this is showing her ability to blend to the people she is with. At that point blending for him.

\- Marta is the one who drove off from the lab when she had no reason to. She could have subtly drove off but she called attention to the fact that she was there with Ransom. This is extremely lucky for her because it seems to save her from Ransom's plot, if there was one. She had been where the housekeeper was

\- She also set Ransom up, despite seeming to have him as an ally, lying and then puking in a cup for only us to see. - Here there's support for Marta playing Ransom, when the detective is doing the final confrontation of the plot with Ransom he literally says ""And it would have worked....and Marta not outplayed you once again by having a kind heart...by saving Fran's life"" (who died by the way). - Marta was the last one to see the housekeeper alive, what says she didn't give her the fatal dose. Also, who is there to say she said ""Hugh"" and not ""You""? Only Marta. - If Marta knew ""instinctively""  which drugs felt like which then why did she assume she was giving Harland the right ones until only after dosing him with the non-lethal ones? She was extremely confident when the detective taped over the vials, which was morphine, so why didn't she question it then and also when she supposedly injected him with the wrong drug? Because she knew what Ransom would do after doing research for his grandfather's book. And she let it play out knowing that Harland would consider his work done and would protect her. - Flashbacks with Joni going to see Harland shows very different details. In Marta's Account, she had already drugged him and in Joni, you can clearly see her picking up a vial and syringe.

\- Ransom doesn't actually confess. He's reacting to being told he is guilty and the cops are watching a story being spun between Ransom and Marta. When he hears Fran is alive I think he might be reacting to the accusations, something in-character for him. Note the detective triggers him by uncharacteristically mocking him. It's why Marta is a better player than him and his grandfather, they are both hot-headed and reactive. He's laughing off the charges and calling Marta out for trying to take the money.",e21a17
f9lugxa,"This movie was *frustrating*. To quote RedLetterMedia's Glass review, I liked the movie until I didn't.

I think my main problem with this movie is my same problem with The Last Jedi: the script is clever than it thinks it is, and the movie subverts your expectations so many times that it subverts it's way out of being an interesting movie. I got bored around the time Marta found the servant's body and was just wishing for the movie to stop smelling its own farts and get on with it.

I honestly loved the truth about Harlan's death and what the movie was from around the 1/4 to 3/4 mark. It played with a lot of the tropes of the whodunit genre in very clever ways. I loved the idea of a classic murder mystery turning out to not be a murder, and despite everyone having a movie for wanting Harlan dead, the true culprit is the one person who had nothing to gain. And the famous detective overlooking that person because he thinks there's some big conspiracy where there is none. I loved all that. And that's leads to my biggest issue with the movie.

I don't consider Knives Out (or The Last Jedi) to be deconstructions, for the reason that in both movies, they twist your expectations and present something truly groundbreaking, only to twist things some more and give you exactly you expect the first time. I really would have loved to see that movie that the middle was leading to. When Chris Evans' character first appeared, I expected him to be the red herring, and Detective Blanc would end up suspecting the asshole despite being innocent because of he fit all the tropes of what the killer would be. I mean, I figured he might be the killer from his introduction, since the dogs don't like him right after Blanc says they're good judges of character. And the real culprit, Marta, has no motive and is eventually forced to reveal the truth in order to stop him from being arrested, as he turns out to have actually turned a new leaf and actually wants to help Marta, as he said he did in the diner. That's an interesting movie that I want to see that would deconstruct tropes like motive, small pieces of evidence adding up to something, and other expected tropes of the genre. A ""whodunnit"" where no one actually did and there's no culprit behind everything. I love that idea.

But that's not what Knives Out is; there's another twist and it turns into what you'd expect from the start. I suspected Chris Evans from his opening scene because it was that obvious, and I thought they were turning him into a red herring with his interactions with Marta, but no, he turns out to be the killer after all (I actually hoped that when Blanc revealed there was a true culprit, it would be Harlan's mother, because that would have actually surprised me). It frustrates me because it teases you with a premise that's more interesting than what the movie actually is. 

I wanted to like the full movie so badly because of how much I enjoyed the first 3/4s, but it instead of sticking with its interesting deconstruction, it subverts that interesting premise to get you back where you started. It's like taking a bunch of detours when going from A to B; you end up when you originally thought you were going to, but you made the journey needlessly complicated. It's the cinematic equivalent of a car taking four hard left turns. I think that's what frustrated me so much about Knives Out (and The Last Jedi too). I heard so much about they go in crazy new directions, and I **adore** the directions they teased, but they end both going back to the same old tired tropes, after taking a fun detour into new territory that's actually unexpected. It reminded me of J.J. Abrams in the lead up to Star Trek Into Darkness, where he spent a lot of effort saying that Benedict Cumberbatch's character definitely was Khan, only for it to turn that he was Khan.

I don't hate it. I enjoyed most of the movie and would give it around a 7/10 as a whole. It was a lot more fun watching this than The Last Jedi (mainly because the humour was actually funny and it didn't spend so long after it twisted itself back into familiar territory). But it was frustrating near the end, and like The Last Jedi, there were a lot of smaller things and ideas I liked, that I think would have created a more interesting movie than the one we got.

P.S. There's one question I have that only occurred to me coming back from the theatre. Why wasn't the servant already dead when Marta found her? Harlan's suicide rested on the fact that morphine would kill you 10 minutes after injection, so it must have been injected soon before Marta found her, but it's revealed that Chris Evans met her 2 hours before that. It might have been because it wasn't injected straight into a vein by a nurse, and if there was a line about that then this is a stupid question (the audience was making a lot of noise in the last scene so it was hard to make some dialogue out). But that's just a thought that came to mind.",e21a17
fc400pj,"The movie is rather entertaining but please don't compare Rian Johnson to Agatha Christie.

f9bal9m,"My wife and I saw this Friday. We loved it but were left with an overall feeling that Marta had orchestrated everything. I thought for sure there’d be a thread here somewhere discussing that theory. Here are a few of our thoughts:
1. She claims to be too tired and having had champagne in order not to play the nightly game of Go. In other flashbacks she is shown clearly refusing champagne and marijuana. Is she lying? Is the entire puke-when-she-lies thing a lie?
2. Every time she “pukes” it is in a container and “unseen” until the final reveal scene. She also pukes almost immediately in all other scenes, but holds it incredibly long during the reveal scene. Is it real or part of an elaborate plan?
3. How does Blanc know about the puking thing? Was he told when he was mysteriously hired? 
4. During the putting-Harlan-to-bed scene, Harlan comments that cutting off Ransom and firing Walt and cutting off Joni & her daughter are all Marta’s ideas. 
5. Marta is the best Go player in the film. She is the best strategist. Better than Ransom. Better than Harlan.
6. How long does it take to die of morphine overdose? Marta tells Harlan 10 minutes. This creates urgency that results in his suicide, yet when Fran is overdosed at the rundown laundry mat she’s still alive 2 hours later when Marta “finds” her. 
7. Donuts. There’s a hole. Donuts in donuts in donuts. 
8. The coffee cup. She has it on the tray at the beginning of the film when she “finds” Harlan. And in her hand at the end. If my theory is right, Marta is the only “self-made” person in the film.  Hard-working immigrant girl does good. In a shady way. 
9. Ransom as the villain is entirely contingent on Grandma’s testimony, but she can’t tell Marta apart from Ransom through a window in the dark, and Blanc’s conjectures. There isn’t a single shred of evidence against him, except a manipulated confession in which he says “so what, IF I did kill Fran, I’ll lawyer up and white, classist privilege will have me out in no time”. Not really an airtight confession, or true admittance of guilt. 
10. We only hear about Fran’s friend at the ME office through Marta. 

Are we way off base?",e21a17
fc668ys,I thought it was decent. I was expecting a major reveal and kept waiting for it...but the movie focused on Martha and Ransom for like 75% of the movie.

I was expecting like a sherlock type of character but he seemed incapable at times. overall thought it was like a 7/10,e21a17
faxsd5x,"Overall I thought it was good. But I needed one more twist. I needed Marta to have known about everything all along and played everyone - she was the only one who could beat the incredibly clever Harlan at Go. Maybe she even manipulated Harlan into leaving her everything and then killed him. Or I needed Harlan alive standing beside her on the balcony looking down at them all in the end, the bit about the prop knife alluding to his fake suicide. I think because it was a movie that promised the unexpected the twists delivered were underwhelming.",e21a17
fh2kgwl,"A very dissapointing film for me. I was expecting something on the level of Johnson's other film 'Brick' (which is one of my favourites). What I got was a high budget, feature-length episode of 'Murder She Wrote' (Johnson even has Marta's mother watching an episode of that show, in Spanish, on her television).

In fact I would say that a partciularly good episode of Murder She Wrote, Columbo or some similar show would be far more enjoyable. The characters in Knives Out were two-dimensional (why was Ransom an asshole again? Because we were told he was?), the politics were rote, hollow and shoe-horned in and the plot was so obvious I was surprised only because I could not believe how basic it was.

The only redeeming features were the setting of the house and Ana de Armas' acting.",e21a17

- when does Marta get the blood stain on her shoe? I dont recall her coming close to Harlan's body after he slit his throat
- There's a scene some where in the middle showing Richard witnessing Linda getting a letter with a few pages (hand written with visible ink). Who gives her the letter and what is it implied to contain? 
- likewise, Linda picks up the invisible ink letter at the end of the movie and the contents of the letter is shown for a bit. Did anyone pick up what was on it? I figured it probably mentioned Richard's affair, but didnt the previous letter also mention it? 
- why didn't the cops check and secure Harlan's toxicology report earlier?

Edit:

- one more question: was it ever explained why Ransom and Harlan had their meeting in Harlan's room?",e21a17

Here is the plot: A scrupulously honest college student named Nao Kanzaki receives a package containing 100 million yen (about US$1 million) and a note that she is now a contestant in the Liar Game Tournament. In this fictional tournament, contestants are encouraged to cheat and lie to obtain other contestants' money, with the losers forced to bear a debt proportional to their losses. When Nao's first opponent, a trusted former teacher, steals her money, she seeks assistance from a con man named Shinichi Akiyama. Though they manage to defeat him, Nao and Akiyama decide to buy out his debt and advance through different rounds of the Liar Game Tournament against merciless contestants, while at the same time attempting to free their opponents from debt and defeat the Liar Game organization from within.",e21a17

It felt a lot like a family drama with a little thriller mixed in than it did a mystery at all- all of the mystery felt removed from the film the second the reveal was made. After that I started to think it could be a red herring, and expected something a little more clever, so I was second guessing and rethinking everything at every moment. I was sort of disappointed that it wasn’t a little more twisted or clever in its outcome. 

I think the advertising of a ‘whodunnit’ style film is a little misleading, and while i love that Johnson has turned the trope on its head, I think he might have turned it so much that it simply can’t be classified as one - because it will inevitably leave viewers a littlle disappointed.",e21a17

Her scenes with Christopher Plumber were my favorites in the film. Looper still holds a special place in my heart, but I think this might be Rian Johnson's best film. I think he can truly be considered a titan of genre films now. He's made a gritty noir film, a wonderful caper about con men, a dark time travel sci-fi movie, (dont kill me for saying this) a pretty good Star Wars movie, and now a perfect and innovative whodunnit.

It helps how all of the heir apparents were played by renowned actresses and actors (I fucking loved how much Toni Collette's character annoyed me) and not literal high schoolers playing Twin-Peaks-California high schoolers. I went from wanting to hug Ana de Armas, to wanting Ana de Armas to puke on me, to wanting Ana de Armas to findom me.

This was partially because I felt like the movie was insulting my intelligence by expecting me to believe that Marta's story was 100% true(Not suggesting that I thought she was lying, but I knew there had to be more to the story because this was advertised as a ""whodunnit"" and there was still more than an hour left of the movie) and also because after the diner scene, it became obvious that Ransom was going to somehow be behind everything.",e21a17

1. Harlan need not slit his throat. He could have waited out for the Morphine to work and die. He already made sure that he was seen on the stairs by Walt. So Walt would testify that Harlan was seen on the stairs 10 minutes after Marta left hence disqualifying Marta's involvement in drug overdose and henceforth concluding that he took the Morphine by himself. He could have kept the empty syringe in his hand or somewhere near him. As a crime novelist, Harlan should also be knowing that Morphine overdose will also be detected in the blood test. 
2. Ransom could have figured out that Marta gave the right medicine right on the day of funeral when he went to switch the labels.

Why are state trooper and detective shown that much dumb ?  But I just dont find whats is so different about the story which people find it so good. There was no twist in the story. I kept waiting may be Chris Evans is not real guy after dogs barked on him and and Nana said you again Ransom. Sometimes directors give wrong signals to lead you astray but no, it was little disappointing.   I think people like feel good stories about someone realizing their mistake in the end.

Then he leaves and they share profits. They exchanged a very interesting look at the end and the whole donut hole in a donut hole speech made me think that there’s another donut hole in the end.

No way would he have maintained functional consciousness had there been a lethal injection... him slumping over would be the indication of the lethal injection well before she figured out a mistake!<

After that: >!Even accepting the overdose, Harlan did kill himself criminally speaking. He may have died with a high level of opioids in his blood but the opioids did not cause his death (eg his cardiovascular functionality wasn’t impaired by them, he did not asphyxiate on his vomit etc). Harlan’s death was caused by blood loss. We are medically advanced enough to tell this. Additionally, there is no one measure of a “lethal dose” (ie habitual users are frequently using what would be a lethal dose for a common person just to get high. Controversial eg: Kurt Cobain has a “lethal dose” of heroin in his system when he committed suicide... but was known heroin user).!< >!surely Harlan would know this, and that all of these facts would come to light - so why put on the charade with Marta to begin with?!< 

Of course then they introduce >!the slayer rule!< I’ve passed an American bar exam but I’m not an attorney nor have I practiced estate law. I took a course on estate law. I barely remember it coming up. But the rule is effective in the movie for >!marta losing her inheritance if found liable in just civil court for Harlan’s death.!< this at least has some teeth to the plot. At the very least >!the family can tie Marta up in civil litigation for ages stating if she hadn’t injected Harlan with the dose than he would not have killed himself!< regardless of the outcome it could present a legal nightmare. 

Otherwise of the coin: depending on where you are >!the slayer rule just means Marta wouldn’t inherit the money - it would go to Marta’s next of kin. Not back to the family. Also depending on where you are: Marta would need to be convicted criminally!< so that doesn’t do much for the family.

The will reading: >!the family is quasi right...while legally Harlan can cut them out of the will it definitely opens the door for a probate battle over the validity of the will. I initially thought it was open and shut that the family was out of the will - until it became apparently that Harlan did not have an attorney involved in the drafting of the will. Apparent because the attorney reading the will had never seen it before. If you have an attorney and you want to cut descendants or spouses out of a will - for the love of god use your attorney to do so. Regardless of the will being deemed valid *eventually* this entirely opens the door for years of litigation. How about a sentence specifically disinheriting your family?!<

There were some funny moments but they were largely overshadowed by my “wtf why would you do that?” Incredulousness 

Probably the best part - the longest span of me not being completely confused by the characters actions would be >!Marta helping Blanc investigate the death!< that felt humorous to me.

And don’t get me wrong the reveal >!that Ransom switched the bottles because he knew Marta was set to inherit the fortune was still a surprise. I just never believed Harlan was overdosing- and didn’t know if I should chuck it up to bad writing or a plot point!<

Idk. I’m still digesting the film. It’s weird that it feels like there’s just a thing or two off with it that are stopping me from really liking it and I can’t quite place what they are.

Edit: my thoughts are meant to be contemporaneous to the scenes as we’re viewing them.",e21a17
f9uhxl0,"Any explanation as to why Harlan wouldn’t assume that his toxicology report would immediately condemn Marta and render his whole charade moot? Kind of a massive plothole

Why would Benoit let someone he knows is misleading him destroy pretty much every piece of physical evidence right before his eyes?

Moreover, how would Fran - who knows nothing about the will or the attempt to frame Marta - think that a clean toxicology report would be damning? Why would she see that and assume that Ransom had attempted to poison his grandfather who died from a knife wound? Why would she try to blackmail someone much larger than her that she thought capable of murder and then demand he meet her alone in an abandoned building? How did she take hours to die right on cue at 10am and if Ransom had zero concern for making the time of death match up in a way that could feasibly implicate Marta than why did he give her such a low dosage? 

What would burning down the medical examiner’s office accomplish when the examiner who prepared and filed the toxicology report could just testify to what he had put in the report? Does Rian think those reports just appear magically sans human intervention?

If the grandma was so blind that she thinks a slight Cuban woman is her jacked, 6’0” great—grandson then how did she even recognize Ransom initially? Why would Chris Evans - who weighs at least twice as much as Ana de Armas - get up the scaffolding without issue but it cracks apart under her weight?

If Harlan was so concerned with Marta’s mother remaining in America that he was willing to slit his own throat and let his entire family believe he had killed himself, why would he leave Marta an amount of money that would obviously put her under public scrutiny? If the money he was leaving could negate the issue, why didn’t he just do that himself when he was alive before it would be subject to massive controversy?

Why would Harlan tell Ransom in advance that he was disinheriting everyone and not expect him to - at the very least - share that with the family? Why would he not just tell everyone at that point or, much more plausibly, tell no one?

Why would the actual culprit hire a famously incisive private detective for his messy attempt at a frame-up? He could’ve saved himself all the trouble with an anonymous tip to the police, especially when he knows his patsy cant even lie!

This flick is a perfect encapsulation of an [Idiot Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiot_plot) -  a plot which is kept in motion solely by virtue of the fact that everybody involved is an idiot. Almost nobody’s actions in the story correspond with a plausible motivation, from Harlan to Fran to Ransom to Benoit.

Why would she need someone else‘s house? What would she do with a publishing company? If she was truly a good person,  then, she should have told the family right away that she has no intentions of keeping their fortune. Instead, Martha simply took advantage of the situation. Elderly  people are vulnerable and can become an easy target for manipulation due to various reasons. Suddenly , the family becomes evil and a total stranger, usually a kind caretaker becomes a confidante and a best friend. I think Harlan might have changed the will, hadn’t he died so suddenly. This movie is a reminder to the families to spend more time with their parents and pay a close attention as to who takes care of their loved ones, in order to avoid any surprises after they pass.",e21a17
fcleyah,"I just finished watching now, and i was so disappointed!

Before anyone bashes me (lol) please just know these are my thoughts and feelings on what i just saw, i am not a movie hater by any stretch.

\*SPOILERS\* So i know Johnson has this ""special"" way of presenting an audience with a story, then trying his best to be real clever with its followthrough, but this movie was supposed to be a smart ""whodunit"", but it simply isn't.

\- The first few minutes play out like a murder mystery, but then you quickly find out who infact is kinda responsible. Then, the rest of the movie is an awkward cover up featuring a suspect who comically (and conveniently) THROWS UP whenever she lies? This is so contrived and plays a massive part in the movie so its kinda hard to ignore.

\- Also, the trailers and advertising set the film up as a whodunit (probably not Rians fault) but i felt like the actual movie was trying its best to show me what i didnt sign up for. I really dont see the sense or value in that. I see a horror trailer, i go see it. I see a mind bending scifi trailer, i go see it. I see a whodunit mystery trailer, but end up watching a woke watered-down episode of Dexter? i am left unsatisfied. Shoot me for wanting what was advertised.

\- The detective himself spends the entire movie not looking very smart at all, and when he does finally figure out whats happening, its not even treated like a wtf moment for him (from an audience perspective). This lands awkwardly because again, the movie does not build him up as being exceptionally smart, but by the end we are lead to believe that he actually is.

\- The ""twist"" at the end also doesn't land very well. Ok, so Cap did it, and i did not see it coming, but the movie portrays itself as smart and unconventional, and trying to build to a big climax........but then the reveal is so bland and sitcom-level shocking. I have seen far better reasons for existing in an episode of The Outer Limits.

\- The movie also thinks its smarter than it really is. And while the actors performances were great, the dialogue itself was average and largely meaningless. I felt this the most when the detective sits down with the old lady and monologues for a bit, but everything coming out of his mouth was garbage. Nothing he says matters in most of the scenes because he is just a plot device of misdirection, and it FEELS that way. Even the ending feels like lines lifted out from the writers ass, out of thin air. Johnson is always more concerned with moving pieces into place, rather than justifying the pieces existence in the first place.

\- Cant believe he played 2 characters as being a woke ""SJW"" major and another as a far right internet troll. This will not age well. I have no issue with the light political messaging but this just feels like lazy contemporary social media commentary a 16 year old would insert.

\- The old man slitting his own throat was also super implausible. It was such a nonsensical reveal that for about 20 minutes i thought ""nah, thats not what happened. Thats so dumb that there has to be a twist to it"". This reveal also kills most of the remaining mystery in the story for me, cause now i literally know who killed him....and its not clever, not funny, not amazing, not even shocking. Its just meh.

Overall, theres still a lot to like. I felt the music was good, i liked the darkish humour tone, acting was stellar, cinematography was great and the set design was good too, but once again Rian Johnson seems more concerned with tinkering with audiences minds, rather than telling a compelling clever story that makes sense in its own universe.

Oh, i also burst out laughing at Daniel Craigs ""Think of it as a tax return by a community theater"". That was hilarious.",e21a17

* I'm no nurse/doctor/pharmacist but if someone received a fatal dose of morphine then the effects should have been apparent really fast, right? It's potency seems a little inconsistent in the film as well. Fatal within 10 minutes the first time it's used but Fran wasn't dead when found an hour later by Marta (although she still died). Just have a hard time believe that if Harlan received that much morphine he would have been lucid like he was.
* Again, I'm not lawyer but isn't up and giving a caregiver your home, publishing company, and money a really, really bad idea? Especially if it was all summarized in under a single page. Feels like a white elephant gift. Marta would probably have no idea how to run the company itself nor handle that windfall. God knows how many lawyers or businessmen will be circling her. Let alone managing that windfall. If Harlan wanted to leave her money that's fine, but it seems like something that could have been handled in a more manageable way for her. Also, isn't a caregiver receiving wealth like that an ethically gray area in the field? Even with Ransom's actions this seems like something that will be fought in the courts for awhile.",e21a17

The family - a great cast of characters played by A-list talent could have been under suspicion but bizarrely do not figure in the plot at all. The denouement is so convoluted that it fails to fit into the form of a mystery story at all. It was all twist and no mystery.

Every character was flat and contributed nothing to the story. I'm sorry but there was no mystery to solve. During the big reveal, what are we supposed to be wondering about? Blanc's big solve is about who hired him? lol Sorry but that is completely retarded.

I guess we were all meant to think that Marta was pure and perfect since, in one cringey moment, the Detective tells her what a 'good person' she is, moments after she confesses to killing her employer. Manic Pixie Dream Maid. She spends most of the movie evading the police and trying to cover herself up. What a great person. Plus, she 'won because she didn't play any of Harlan's games'.

I get that it could be a character trait, maybe he's a bodybuilder in his spare time. Sure, that could work. This is supposed to be a light-hearted mystery/comedy anyway. But in general, especially for more dramatic movies, watching this made me realize having a body like that really limits the credibility of an actor in certain roles.

fcb76a2,"I don't want to give an overkill on this film, but it received so much hype and has so many holes that I can not seriously accept it. Here are some more contradictions:  
Because  Marta thought she had adminstered a strong morphine, why wasn't she suspicious that the drug did not seem to be doing what it was supposed to do?Because Harlan remained alive to the supposed morphine, why would she so politely permit him to slit his throat (unless she wanted him to do that)?  
Could an elderly and weak Harlan easily slit his throat or did Marta do that?  
Marta returns by climbing a trellis on the side of the house that leads to a window entrance and to a secret door. This secret door has no significance except as a ""plug in"" to allow a convenient means to permit Marta (and Ransom) to enter undetected by not goiing through the main entrance door.  Bad cinema.  
The entire building housing the autopsies (contains toxicology report that shows Harlan did not perish from any drug) and death records, which are usually kept in metal and fireproof cabinets, burns down. Is it that easy for one person quickly to burn down an entire building undetected and destroy vital records?  
Why did Ransom use morphine to murder Fran and why did he leave before she died? To frame Marta?  Would not the autopsy show that type of morphine must have been adminstered much earlier than when she could have  arrived?  
The film survives if Marta is the culprit. Makes for a more twisting murder mystery when the killer outwits the detective.",e21a17

f99hzv5,"Honestly I was disappointed with that movie, but maybe my expectations were wrong, I expected it will be more detective/drama then comedy. Film was quite entertaining, yes, yet completely didn’t meet high expectations, it is bearable only if you watch it like pure comedy or parody on detective movies. And again, sadly extremely high percentages in reviews mostly have nothing to do with story, acting and overall production quality, but with political undertone. Comedy moments were mostly one big “Spanish shame” or just way too cringy, and sudden switches between cringe and seriousness didn’t saved situation. Story isn’t good either if you care to remembering details while watching. Only strongpoint of “Knives out”  is actors performance, it was really pleasant to watch, Evans and Craig did great job, and notably Shannon was just straight up great in his role.

f93cpo1,Imagine having a film revolving around a character whose tell is she throws up when lying. Such a convenient gimmick. And then of all the knives to grab he grabs the fake one. Also the ending was so convoluted yet obvious from the trailer. Considering how much work nonsense was thrown in the story I'd expect something worthwhile. Also 90% of the jokes fell flat. Like all Rian films very overrated and underwhelming. 3/5 at best.,e21a17
f9fj8ne,"Not a very good murder mystery in my opinion. The camera angle on medicine dropping and the dogs being friendly to her gave away the plot in seconds. Not to mention that if you’re gonna shoehorn politics into the plot, don’t give us surface lvl reminders every 5 secs. Yes we know Richard is a prick, Marget is a entitled liberal artist student, and the kid who’s name escapes me is a nazi. Nothing about this mystery felt meaningful.

A call from the hospital relates that Fran is all right and will recover. With that misinformation, Ransom immediately and conveniently admits his guilt – rather far-fetched to do that immediately, and without a lawyer.  
Why did Ransom hire investigator Benoit? If Ransom framed Marta, why did he not ask for a toxicology report by himself? The film also has the investigator proving the guilt of his own client -- a first in murder mysteries.

f8wf0ka,"Loved this movie!! Just one thing I was questioning as I left the theater...
(Spoilers ahead obviously)

We know Fran blackmailed Ransom with the toxicology report because she witnessed him swapping Harlan’s medications. However Fran would have seen that the report was normal which would’ve contradicted her thought that Ransom tried to kill him by switching the meds, so her blackmail would have no power against Ransom and wouldn’t prove that he did anything (Fran didn’t know Marta accidentally switched the meds herself thus giving the correct doses). 

In addition, by the time he confronted Fran, Ransom already knew Marta had given the correct meds because she admitted to him that she accidentally switched them. So he would’ve been able to deduce that the toxicology report would be negative anyway and wouldn’t have had to have the pressure of rendezvousing with Fran and passing on the blackmail letter to Marta. So basically if Ransom ignored Fran’s blackmail he could have gotten away with it since Fran would have no proof of anything other than her word against his. The only reason I can think of as to why Ransom did meet Fran and burned down the medical examiner’s office was if he was scared the toxicology report would be positive for overdose despite already knowing Marta switched the meds he had already switched himself. Otherwise, even if Fran did release the toxicology report (which would be normal) Ransom could deny any accusations of swapping meds since the report is normal and would support that.

Maybe I’m overthinking it or I’m just missing something and I’m also trying to recall the timing of these events while the movie’s fresh in my kind. Any thoughts?",e21a17

Her demeanor to Harlan is also callous and rude, and I doubt she would've treated him the same way in front of his family. How you act in private says more about your character than how you act in public. Despite all this, Harlan decides to give everything to her. Okay.


Marta and her family are not blameless. Aside from the obvious fact that she caused Harlan's death, after she gets the inheritance, her sister excitedly asks her ""Are we rich?! We're rich, aren't we?"" This is the same attitude shown by Harlan's family; Marta's family is no different. What annoys me even more is that afterwards, he mom says, ""I don't like this Marta, I don't like this one bit."" Like, *oh noOoooOoooOoo!

They even did a horrible job at convincing me it could possibly be any of the people they mentioned. Then it felt like I was just waiting on my theory to be revealed that it was ransom especially after that scene when the grandma said ""ransom back again"". It was almost dumb after that point and I was hoping to god they would have a double or triple twist with Marta fooling everyone but no it was just so straightforward. They didnt interview the Ransom character, he was the only one story kept being revealed, the only characters name who kept popping up, the only viably mobile character and also they named the character RANSOM for some damn reason.

f979xf2,"I think that Harlan actually knew (roughly) how the events would play out and I believe that he knew he hadn't been overdosed with morphine.  In fact I think there's evidence to say that Harlan may have known that the vials were switched from the get-go and that he intentionally took his own life knowing he wasn't dying in order to play one last game with his children.  

After the party, Harlan protested to taking his medication as normal because he knew that his ""normal"" dose would have killed him.  He also intentionally caused chaos by flipping the Go table, knocking the vials to the floor.  I suspect that Harlan realized that Marta picked up the ""correct"" medication and formulated his plan from there.

At the very least, Harlan must have known from the moment that he was dosed, as 30x your normal dosage of morphine via IV should be *immediately* noticeable.  He also made a few statements that hinted at his knowledge of the events to come, such as saying ""Ransom couldn't tell a real knife from a prop"".  Committing suicide to cover up his ""murder"" even we he knew he wasn't dying is very like him as several of his children described the ""games"" he would play with them & at their expense.

It may be far-fetched to think that he could foresee how everything would play out (up to and including the prop knife), but it was described that ""the plots of his books appeared fully materialized in his head"" as if he could take a set of situations and follow them to their logical conclusion, however absurd.

At the very least, everything certainly played out *exactly* how he would have wanted it.  Every truth he wanted to tell got told despite his family's best efforts and he got to use his death as one last chance to play with his childrens' heads.",e21a17

Then when we see it from her POV later, he's waving her in only to back up his xenophobic, anti-immigration point.",e21a17

It was surreal watching him read such obviously ridiculous lines with such a straight-laced performance. The only comparison I could think of was Adam West's take on Bruce Wayne/Batman.

For the longest time I thought Harlan wasn't dead and it was all a ploy for him to accomplish... something. Clues were here: his comment about prop knives, he's the one to drop the Go board with the meds, the fact he's seeding dissent in his family, his cover up plan he came up with almost immediately... but all were explained for different reasons too. I've already seen people here sharing other theories they had during the movie too! It really freed up the plot to go in a multiple of directions.",e21a17

Blanc plays up his image as not being a particularly good detective (especially with his Gravity’s Rainbow method like “I basically just sit back and then take a guess at the end”)

They're interrupted at the 4th minute mark, so Harlan probably killed himself at the 6th minute mark, right around the time the first effects started showing up. 

One could argue he should have realized something was up when he didn't feel anything, but there are also explanations for that: he might have actually started to feel something with the combination of stress, psychosomatic effect, and maybe some morphine left inside the bottle and mixed with his medicine. So he has no reason to doubt he is ODing. On the other hand, Marta was a mess and wasn't thinking straight, when Harlan started to boss her around she stopped questioning things.

Also, Harlan admits he's forgetting something in his master plan: the toxicology report, which a mystery novelist like him should have thought about and which made his scheme pointless.

I was wrong about that being his point, but the idea that someone had already switched them beforehand seemed so brilliant that I held onto it for the rest of the movie and just tried to figure out who'd done it.

Unfortunately that's where my low intelligence comes in and I couldn't figure out it was Ransom until the movie spelled it out.

Also, the ketorolac dose she was intending to give (100mg) is way too high of a dose, so that part doesn't really make sense either.

Ransom swapped the contents of drugs. Marta used the vial labeled morphine because she did not read the label. She knew what the viscosity of the medication was like in comparison to the morphine. Being accustomed to the difference, she just picked it up and injected him with his actual medicine.

Basically, we're not allowed to be upset at things like this. If we get mad, we play into the stereotypes.

fa2img7,"Absolutely agree. Great movie, and you could argue that making the guy everyone bashes on into the actual perp is almost a twist in itself, but I still feel like he was a little unsatisfying. Since Ransom kind of isn't around for a lot of the family stuff, he just doesn't get developed as much as the others, imo. And having the end of the movie produce a whaaa moment isn't just about whether or not we can predict it ahead of time (which I didn't) -- it's about suddenly seeing something in a character that you hadn't seen there before. In this case, he was a douche, but was revealed to be exceedingly douchey, so...

Again, that makes it sound like I didn't like the movie, but I thoroughly did. Debating what could have made the ending better is just a question of adjusting the cherry on top. And given the ending they went with, I think they supplied lots of details to make for a nuanced affair, with solid twists and turns.

Edit: also just noticed that if you google the cast, Chris Evans comes up first. That's not cool. Perceptive future viewers could easily read into that (rightly).",e21a17

If they invented a new suspect right near the end it would have been no better than your typical weekly procedural.

I actually think Harlan knew the medicine was fine because he kept fiddling the time frame (2 mins left, 6 mins left) and wasn’t symptomatic at all, not even for that dosage. He was perfectly lucid. And Marta didn’t spot that because she was panicking. Compared to Fran later on who was fading out very slowly. I think he suicided himself knowing that, considering most of his past actions were pretty much putting his affairs in order.

He didn’t give his dysfunctional family the time to sabotage his will so he enforced it there and then. And went out with what he thought would be the perfect story to end his life and his career.",e21a17

While Linda didn't make a big deal about her relationship with Marta as some did, I don't recall any evidence of disrespect.

Harlan is depicted as a clever and caring old man and Ransom is basically depicted as a psychopath, but only in the film’s unraveling of the murder plot. I just don’t think the motive makes a lot of sense outside of “this is a clever murder story”.",e21a17

I think this gave him freedom to use any trope however he wanted, so I think this is why he was comfortable revealing the actual ""murder"" early on.  He knew he could give that away because he knew we would still wonder how it happened that way.  He knew we wouldn't actually believe Marta was a murderer, so we were able to keep guessing.

I never thought about the bottles being switched until Harlan started talking about how that would be a great way to kill someone - immediately after establishing that he was cutting off all his family members.

The third hint that made it clear to me was when Harlan explicitly states how 4 minutes have passed, and Marta has stressed how he will be dead in 10 minutes, which then indicates that he should be showing some kind of symptoms at this point (especially as he was given the drugs *intravenously*).

I think it was a real masterstroke to ‘reveal’ the ‘killer’ in the first act. It knocked me out of my seat. Like many here, I’m a huge fan of old sleuth novels and media, and have read virtually every Poirot. It takes something special to take me by surprise within the confines of the mystery genre, but that was special.

It was also masterful because once you think Marta is the ‘culprit’ and that the rest of the film will be about whether or not she gets away clean, your mind sort of stops playing the usual game of ‘anyone could be a suspect’ to some extent (albeit we all knew there would be some other reveals - my money was on more killings taking place courtesy of the blackmail, and the real mystery being who is the blackmailer).",e21a17

* Ransom realizes that Marta *won't* be blamed for Harlan's death because the tox results show that his morphine levels aren't high enough. He sends Fran's blackmail letter to Marta, except he changes the time from 8am to 10am and he only photocopies the header. He then sets the forensics lab on fire.

* At 8am the next day (or whatever the letter said), Ransom meets with Fran at the laundromat and injects her with morphine.

* At 10am, Marta goes to the laundromat because that's what it says on *her* letter. Fran tells her to check the weed stash.",e21a17

Yet she had no problem talking absolute shit about the rest of the family for using his money - like her brother, the college girl etc. She's consistently shown to be quite the hypocrite - her quick flip on treating Marta, how much she spoils Ransom etc. Once the will actually came out she reveals her true colours and you can see that she despite her big talk she was relying / expecting the inheritance  as her right while the father felt it was no ones right but his own, and felt he had done her a disservice to rely on his inheritance. If she truly was as self made as she likes to claim, she wouldnt have blown up nearly as badly as she did (well a blow up is understandable regardless, but not on the level of hers).

fffqfvu,"Sociopathy and psychopathy aren't used as psychological terms anymore and instead the official diagnosis of guys like Ransom must come from the current list of personality disorders under the [DSM-5](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5).

In my opinion, Ransom seems to have some traits of [narcissitic personality disorder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder). From my impression of him, it fits with the definition of the disorder: taking advantage of others, grandiose perceptions of themselves, excessive need for admiration. Stuff like that.

That's as far as I'll go though bc I only have a bachelor's in psychology and a more precise diagnosis ideally should come from a more credible professional. Then again Ransom is just a fictional character so don't take any diagnosis as some word of God that will also necessarily to real people who seem similar to Ransom.

I thought the piano notes were genuinely an eccentric way for Blanc to rush Lt. Elliot towards getting to the point during the interrogations.

Edit: Gonna add a quote by Harlan that sums up Ransom's character bc I like when movies do this:

In fact, since she left the drugs, someone might very well have accused her anyways once the will was read. One of the family members might accuse her of encouraging Harlan to commit suicide (I think one of them actually did do this, but there was no proof so it was ignored). And you can be prosecuted for encouraging suicide. She could be charged with manslaughter, Slayer's rule comes into play, and and Harlan's will would be nullified.

With his method, even if he had drugs in his system, that's not what killed him. His cause of death would have been ruled as ""Exsanguination"" and it would be ruled as suicide.",e21a17
fi8xsx1,"Just got back from watching this, and I found the entire premise unbelievable. I guess I had my hopes set too high, because I did not enjoy this film nearly as much as others seem to. 

Don't the effects of morphine administered intravenously take place almost immediately? As in, would Harlan still be lucid enough to talk after the injection? Not to mention that I'm supposed to believe Marta subconsciously used the correct medication ""because [she's] a damn good nurse""? I also can't understand Harlan's train of thought. 'Oh dear, my nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication that will result in my imminent death, but she's a good girl in spite of that so I'm going to gruesomely kill myself in order to cover up for her incompetence.' 

I was overall disappointed in the ensemble cast. I found the characters to be quite bland when they were supposed to be wacky and colorful. Chris Evans was the best character in this movie and I say that as someone that is generally ambivalent towards him. Jamie Lee Curtis was also very good. However, I just don't think Don Johnson is a good actor, Toni Collette didn't sell me on her role as the in-law gold-digger, and Michael Shannon does not seem convincing in roles where he is not playing a borderline psychopath with barely-contained rage. Despite trying to make the entire family seem like horrible people, I found Walt's son to be the only remotely upstanding character in the whole bunch. Despite being the alt-right nazi masturbator who is addicted to his phone, he is also the only character that doesn't lie as well as the only one who doesn't exhibit any greed or malice.

To be clear, although I personally did not particularly enjoy it, I would still call it a good film, and would recommend it to others, and I respect the opinions of those who disagree with me.

Maybe I'm misremembering, but from what I remember, her vomiting was something that was well known to the family and those around her. Like it was something that had afflicted her for her whole life or at least since she started working for them. That would mean she would have to have been faking it for a very long time beforehand for no specific reason in particular. So unless she faked her vomiting affliction for years (did they say specifically how long she worked for them?) in the hopes that she could utilize it later for nefarious purposes, the whole idea doesn't make a lot of sense.

Also, she'd have to be able to throw up on cue. I think it's probably more likely she turned down the champagne in that specific scene, but had some later.",e21a17
f903l6z,"Yes, agree there's lots of holes in this interpretation. But what other reason is there for the story to focus repeatedly on them playing Go unless it's to tell us she's a cunning strategist who thinks several moves ahead of Harlan and Ransom.

They pretty much painted Evans as a suspect from the start, almost very Law&Order:SVU style where they minimise his screen time from the get-go but remind you every now and then that he's not just some cameo. They even took the cliche route of making him the asshole who's actually a good guy, only for him to actually be the bad guy.. Nothing wrong but it was so predictable for me.

With such a star studded cast I thought the actors/actresses would be given more leeway to deliver the plot twists. Sitting through Craig read out his hypothesis of how it all unfolded at the end was a little cheesy and anticlimactic to me. Took away any room for the audience to contemplate and conclude for themselves (but maybe the Director wanted it that way). The music score was amazing though!👌

The final vomit--knowing the vomit was coming gave it tension.  Could she keep up the ruse long enough, could she hold back her vomit  until Ransom had implicated himself (I originally thought the struggle was going to be until he got out of the room to confess to the poice).

Meg wasn't literally going to college for a ""post contemporary feminist etc. etc. degree"" and Jacob wasn't a Nazi. They both wanted to think the other was their stereotype when in actuality they were both just opposite ends of the political spectrum.

I liked where, in the first act, they reveal that Christopher Plummer is actually dead and Ana de Armas is totally culpable. It turned a murder mystery on its head a little, revealing the actions right away.

The issue I had was Chris Evans was the only legit suspect for the future reveal. Ignoring how most everyone else besides Jamie Lee Curtis are complete fucking morons and not capable of screwing over Ana. Evans was the only character besides her and Craig given any proper amount of screen time. So while Rian Johnson thought he was being clever by writing in the usual ""*everyone is a suspect*"" motivations he didn't write in enough presence for all the characters. At no point did I think JLC was guilty, she got like 15 minutes of screen time all movie. This is where the movie thinks it is being clever when it's about as sneaky as a dude playing poker wearing aviators. Because how satisfying would it be to have Don Johnson be the guilty party? Not very. 

The humor in the movie was fantastic. I laughed at many of the setups and lines. A great example being JLC telling Craig ""*I know what you're doing, and you won't bait me into shit talking my family*."" **Hard cut** to Don doing exactly that! Or Craig's doughnut hole analogy. It got dumber and funnier as he kept rambling on about it. Or when Ana calls out Michael Shannon's dumbass for ""*so your resources will solve this problem? Well guess what I have those now bye bye!*"" Or the fact that every time Ana's country of origin is mentioned it's different every time.

Overall it is a fun and enjoyable whodunnit. Hollywood should totally make more of these. 7.5/10 for Knives Out.",e21a17

4) she established with her main opponent her vomiting weakness months ago. She's a nurse. She could access drugs to induce vomiting easily. Its unclear who told the detective about this, but it wasnt her.


I feel this is all hinted at by her superior go strategy: a game where one move flips your opponents strength into their weakness, it's about being adaptive, and planting long term seeds early.

The idea of switching the drugs and framing the suicide sounded to me like the kind of dramatic flair that Harlan would have done. One final game for the family to play. 

After the movie I was also thinking that when Marta was panicking looking for the lifesaving drug, Harlan very calm, he even mentioned once that it's been like 4 of his 10 minutes, but wasnt exhibiting any signs of overdose. He mentions how he'd be sweating and shaking but showed none of that and Marta was to panicked to realise.

I remember reading that some people think if alien societies exist, they probably play Go also, because the rules are simple but deep.

The significance is just that they're all clever and smart, but Marta is more so than Ransom.  Probably there was also a bit of Harlan trying to knock him down a peg like he was doing to everyone else, too, by writing them out of the will, firing Walt, etc.  Also probably to show why he gave her everything in his will, by showing how she was actually his friend and not just a leech like everyone else.",e21a17

She is not trying to outsmart Harlan rather she is simply just making ""a pretty picture"" (don't remember exactly what she says) and wins. So, Harlan telling Ransom this is effectively letting Ransom know that the good/innocent (Marta) will come out on top of the evil (Ransom).

During the movie, the character of Michael Shannon yells angrily at his brother Ransom (Evans) that now that he has been disinherited he won't be able to pay for his ""fancy new drugs"".

So she devised a plan to force him to out himself: She got the toxicology report from her family member. Now she didn't understand what was in the report, but she knew that if Ransom did something he would know there was something incriminating in it so he would come to the rendez-vous. If he did nothing, then he wouldn't care about the report and wouldn't come.

Or at least that's what I'm telling myself because I cannot buy Harlan coming up with this mess inside of 3 minutes (if 2 had already passed, and he should have started to feel the effects at 5 minutes, he had 3 minutes to get the plan out and get rid of Marta before she should have noticed he was having no symptoms).",e21a17

Now, the only way to get the money is to keep her convinced that she really killed Harlan, so she will give him the cut in exchange for his help avoiding capture and her mom being deported. At that point he switched from trying to out to ""help her"" (but really cover his tracks, esp after Fran blackmails him) by killing Fran and torching the lab/Fran's copy.

I did appreciate that you start immediately hoping Craig isn’t the talented detective he claims he is, so that Marta will get away with it. But ultimately it sucked away the intrigue — as for what felt like a majority of the film you see the rest of family as just scumbags, rather than scumbags who may be guilty. 

As soon as Evans took Marta for dinner at that lodge the viewer can piece it together about 80% how he did it. 

That being said I also agree with your point on the marketing of the film as a classic “whodunnit”. I too can’t help but wonder if they didn’t go so heavy on that marketing if I would appreciate the clever subversions Johnson made to the tropes in the genre.

One thing that can be caught is that Marta has successful convinced everyone that she is literally incapable of lying.  It's the oddest thing, she vomits whenever she lies.  One thing that many people will note is that, she does not in fact lie at any point in the film.  But she does withhold information, which means she strategically  gives out information.

But, perhaps her vomiting at lying is an act and is in fact a lie.  Perhaps she just has a skill of vomiting on command.  One question that comes throughout the film is never answered.  Where is Marta from?  She has told multiple people that her family is from multiple countries, Uruguay, Paraguay, Ecuador, Venezuala.  It's just endless.  So where is she really from?  She seems to have lied to many people about that.  There are other times in the movie where third parties indicate times where she has lied or told untruths.

At the end of the film she is seen on a balony looking down on all the people she defeated.  One of the things of note is that.... even what you see can't always be trusted.

My favorite parts of the movie were either when it went full comedy (Chris Evans hating on everyone and the family argument, or the aftermath of the will) or full tension (Walt meeting Marta in the hallway, or Marta finding Fran).

But like 3/4 of the movie felt like it was coasting by with occasional jokes or subtle nudges with little character or plot development. While the subtle references are cool, they didn't succeed in dragging me in.

Also, the cast was bloated and therefore a lot of people were definitely underused.

Additionally, his stated goal was to pull scrutiny away from Marta and, by extension, her undocumented mother. If he'd clearly died of morphine overdose, that would put a great deal of scrutiny on her. (granted, this would have ended up coming out in the toxicology report, but as he stated there were going to be things he missed).

And, finally, there's the simple fact that this was all done in a hurry. It wasn't premeditated. Dude just found out that he was going to die within 10 minutes and he came up with all of that in the blink of an eye *and* had to explain it all to Marta and convince her to go along.

f9crz5x,"> Fun movie, I personally just didn't like all the super current political ham-fisting shit

I actually completely disagree here. I was really impressed at how this movie presented political themes in a very natural way that made sense for the characters within the context of the story. One of the core themes in this movie I think was the idea that the political differences present in this family (as shown in the immigration debate they had) are fundamentally shallow; they go out the window the moment their money and power are threatened (as exemplified by Meg revealing the immigration status of Marta's mom to her family as well as going from being offended on Marta's behalf and saying ""you're a part of this family"" at the beginning to saying ""but we are his real family"" on the phone after the will reading) It's a pretty great illustration of the old Carlin bit about ""it's a big club, and you ain't in it"" in my opinion and it fits this family so god damn well, I love it.

There are definitely plenty of movies that convey a political idea in a very heavy-handed way that doesn't end up feeling natural (imo The Post falls into this trap), but I would hold this movie up as a near-perfect example of how political themes should be conveyed.

I'm curious; what parts did you find to be ham-fisted?

I just watched the movie and this was along the lines of thought I had, so after thinking about it a while I went online to see if others had the same though and some reasoning behind it I missed and found pretty much nothing.

Only 2 mentions of the possibility, one that didn't give any detailed reasoning and yours.

I think this isn't a case of her being the *real* real killer, but rather some intentionally placed seeds out doubt regarding her innocence. A conclusive answer isn't meant to be achievable.

It's only one part I disagree with you on, I think the puking thing is real, as I don't see that being faked as necessary to have her possibly be guilty.

The puking being real even supports it. During her interview she very carefully didn't lie by only telling parts of the truth. But she puked afterwards.

It could be that what she did was so close to lying that it triggered anyway, but I see that as indicating the possibility that she did lie about something.

It's yet another uncertain thing, but it's things that the movie could have made certain if it wanted but I think it intentionally made uncertain in order to make her guilt a possibility but not a certainty.",e21a17

I think the only point to the boy being an alt right troll was to add to the family’s tension and dysfunction, even though nothing really came of it. The characters’ political views are important to the story as they fuel the whodunnit aspect and serve as a bit of a misdirect imo. Particularly in Meg’s case.

No she wasn't, Meg was probably the closest to her and she spilled the beans about her undocumented mother. Also don't forget that they voted her out of the funeral. Makes you think they would have voted her out of the party if it wasn't for Harlan.

f8wbzgn,"Totally agree this movie is overhyped: mostly Rian Johnson (whom I’ve enjoyed when he had more limitations and less ego stroking as a big name) marveling at his own contrived cleverness. The linchpin to the solution was built on some pretty shaky grounds and sped through so rapidly people would easily glaze over it. But it's what stuck with me after the movie:

>!What I still don't get is why Fran, though she obviously hates Ransom and saw him suspiciously around the medicine bag instead of at the funeral, didn't stop after she saw the toxicology report. If the report showed that Harlan's blood was clean, she'd have zero evidence of Ransom's supposed foul play (from her POV, not knowing anything about Marta). Why would she act in the emboldened way she did, setting up the dumbest possible secret rendez-vous in an abandoned cleaners, unarmed, with literally zero evidence of his wrongdoing? The whole 8am to 10am discrepancy bothered me, too: if Ransom OD'ed her at 8am she'd clearly be dead by the time Marta got there.!<",e21a17
f8xgwoc,"I disagree with a few of your points, at least concerning the inconsistency of the plot, but I do respect your passion so don't take this as an attack.

Marta had extremely good reason to keep the inheritance from the family. They were all extremely untrustworthy and very CLEARLY didn't care about Marta. There are two recurring gags, one where Marta's country of origin changes every time it's brought up, and how everyone wanted Marta to be at the funeral, but were 'outvoted'. While funny, they also serve to show that the family doesn't care about Marta at all.

Ransom had to go through with blackmailing Marta because Fran KNEW that Ransom had something to do with the murder. So he couldn't let her live, but the housekeep getting murdered so close to death of his grandfather would raise questions. If she just goes missing someone is going to notice, and it might come back to him. But if Marta takes the fall for Fran dying it clears his own name.

I don't know why the investigators WOULD wait for the full medical examination report. AFAIK the whole thing can take quite a while, and you give no reason the investigators as characters in the story should wait. Yes, if they launched AFTER it may have been easier to catch Ransom, but you're using details that the police wouldn't know to reach that conclusion, and the toxicology report pretty much proves that he had killed himself. There wouldn't be an investigation if they had waited.

Detective LeBlanc suspects Marta the entire movie. He says so at the end, pointing to the bloodstain on her shoe. I can't say for sure because the movie doesn't give enough detail about his thought process at the time on why he waited in the car, but it wasn't because he thought Marta was completely innocent that's for sure.

I agree with a couple points though.

I have no clue why Fran was unarmed, all I can chalk it up to is that she wasn't a smart character? Which I think can happen, but yeah it is like super bizarre.

The morphine rules seemed rather unclear to me. I don't know if she meant you die after 10 minutes, or after 10 minutes you're guaranteed to die or what. I don't think it's unexplainable (maybe because Fran is younger it takes longer???) but they don't do a good job explaining it in the movie.

There are other points I *personally* disagree with, but I think it's more subjective. This movie really isn't like a whodunit, so I think it's fair to be disappointed if that was the expectation, but I also think the movie premise is fun regardless of expectations. I also liked Marta's character and didn't find her all that bland, but it's rather subjective. Also I think it's kind of a central point that she is not making decisions for herself, since at the end of the movie we get the payoff that is her FINALLY making the decision regardless of the other characters and what they want her to do.

f9gf4d3,">I would call this movie pretty good if it hadn't bent over backwards to fight the genre it's supposed to be part of.

It's a deconstruction of a genre which is hardly an unusual thing in movies. In fact, it's not even unprecedented for a movie to be a deconstruction of a genre whilst also being a movie in that genre: Scream being a notable example.

> It becomes even more obvious as the script spends another 30 minutes trying to ignore the prospect of a toxicology report. 

I'm not sure I understand this criticism? The toxicology report became a major part of the plot. I'm not sure why the police would initially consider it a priority when everyone except Benoit believed it was a straightforward suicide. 

>Then they introduce Chris Evans and... he's immediately desperate to help her out, feeding her all sorts of orders to get her to behave exactly as he needs, remembering addresses too well, confessing to everything too soon. I don't know if the idea was to make him so obvious a red herring that we couldn't possibly believe it was him but... well, obviously it was him, and we're left with no mystery at all.

I'm not sure I agree. Ransom hated the rest of his family and he wasn't desperate to help Marta out because he was a nice guy, it was to get a cut of the money. I think the movie will be really enjoyable on rewatch even when you know the mystery because of the clues Rian Johnson drops in throughout the movie (the great grandmother saying Ransom was back ""again"", Harlan mentioning prop knives, the stuff with the dogs and the baseball). Johnson is a master of tightly written plots where everything ties together.",e21a17
f9evbaz,[deleted],e21a17
f8vc99p,"> Honestly I think the majority of these things I just guessed because they either seem or straight up are Agatha Christie plots. 

I think that's the (beside) the point - Harlan was a mystery author. I say (beside) the point because I don't think this was about making a dense, puzzle-box whodunit. It certainly didn't follow the Christie structure as it wasn't afraid to telegraph and reveal (to the point of almost spoiling). Which, for me, leaves one of two possibilities:

1) Rian Johnson isn't a very good filmmaker when it comes to films like this and should stick to space movies. But this can't be true because ""Brick"" is a dense deconstruction of the detective movie that stands, in my mind, up there with Chinatown and The Long Goodbye.

or

2) The mystery wasn't the point. This was satire with Agatha Christie as the vehicle. The hole in the center of the donut hole. These characters wouldn't survive five minutes with Poirot. The film was really a critique of American new money entitlement and is brilliantly bookended with the coffee mug changing hands from the white self-made millionaire to the immigrant working class. The family didn't even know what country she came from (Ecuador, Uruguay, Paraguay). They had the trappings of Agatha Christie's aristocratic characters without the poise, charm, or intelligence. So, from that, I would put this on the thematic level of the movie ""Clue"", rather than ""Murder on the Orient Express"".

When you stop watching it for the murder mystery, there's a different kind of mystery at work.",e21a17
f8v4jz6,"I also thought it was a little contrived and convenient - no real whodunnit would reveal the real murderer so quickly and so the only real answer was that the medicine had been swapped. And as you say by that point Ransom was really the only one who could fit the bill.

But surprisingly none of that spoiled it for me. It turns out that I didn't need a surprise-twist-reveal for a film that was otherwise so well and smoothly made - in that sense it may actually be better than a typical whodunnit as I know I can watch and enjoy this one again.",e21a17
f957ezn,"Hmm.

Reading your line of thought it seems you jumped from thinking one person was guilty (the devious Marta) to another (Harlan in an elaborate set up) to a third (the ""obviously"" guilty Evans). To my mind that's enough swerves from a mystery like this for complaints about it being too straightforward to seem churlish. Especially given the first person you suspected (Marta) very explicitly didn't kill anyone and the last person (Evans) didn't actually kill Harlan either and is ultimately arrested for an entirely different murder. If you guess three different people are ""guilty"" in any murder mystery then you'll probably be right on one of them and the film did enough to ensure that you (someone who has clearly seen a lot in this genre) made a few wrong guesses along the way.

Plus it slightly misses the point in terms of  what (I think) a lot of critics mean when they say it's a clever film. It's actually a very traditional mystery in the sense that it plays fair with the audience and provides a relatively straightforward answer to the murder, in a sense. The clever bit is how it does this while still playing with the format by explicitly showing us who actually killed Harlan early on (himself), making who hired Craig and why the key mystery of the film, turning the middle section (which would traditionally be the clue gathering part of a murder mystery) into a crime thriller before reverting back for he traditional murder mystery reveal only to have the ultimate bad guy be arrested for an entirely different murder. All while also being a satire.
 
In other words the trick of the film isn't leading you astray on ""who killed Harlan?"" but rather making you think that this was the question you should be asking. At which point poking holes in the ""who killed Harlan?"" thread isn't particularly damning, I think. Especially when it did manage to lead you astray on who killed Harlan too.",e21a17

f9kwoub,"I actually feel like this part makes a whole lot of sense with what they were saying about Harlan's character.

He wasn't doing it to save Marta, not deep down. The truth is Harlan was a massive drama queen and the second he realised he was going to die he saw it as a massive opportunity to stage the perfect murder and 'get away with it'. Commiting suicide in front of everyone, writing a note saying he took the morphine himself, anything like that would of ruined the fun of it.

I really think all that talk to Marta about saving her mother was more to convince her to go along with it than because he was genuinely concerned.

I'm sure he cared for Marta a whole lot but ultimately he's as bad as the rest of the family in the way he used her as a prop in his own personal theatre production. 

Even when he gave the money it was meant to be done as a huge shocking reveal. As Marta surmises it was more about getting at his family than her.

Second, while it's your opinion that the movie loses mystery and thus effect (something I disagree with, the movie turns into a thriller and then back to a mystery through the use of the seed ""who called Blanc"" and the turn of Fran in the second act), you are completely misrepresenting Marta's involvement, the movie, whether you agree or disagree, presents Marta as a victim of circumstances and Harlan's suicide as a way to protect her, and thus gives us an emotional anchor towards wanting Marta safe. The movie is indeed more interested in Marta's journey than having a more ""generically"" structured murder mystery with a ""double whammy"", and I personally enjoyed that. Blanc signals the resolution at the end of the second act, when Marta promptly ends the thrill by saving Fran, thus not playing into the typical murder mystery cliché structure... Until we get the double whammy.

Really the only bit that threw me off was why Harlan cut his throat and not his wrists, which was a big red herring, but Harlan was really a big drama queen.

f9f7fjt,"That political stuff is a total Agatha Christie trope, so I was actually happy to see it here.

I was taken aback by the film's structure as well, but I suspect that was Rian Johnson's way of deconstructing Christie-esque mysteries. This narrative was pretty much exactly like a Poirot story EXCEPT that it pretty much ignored Poirot's POV and focused on the killer's POV instead.  When Poirot gives his big speech at the end of one of his stories, he revelations to the characters are also revelations to the reader - but in this case, we saw it all happen earlier.  I thought it was interesting. 

Of course, Knives Out tries to have its cake and eat it too - by introducing a second revelation which WAS shielded from the audience - and that aspect of the movie is where I felt it got a little sloppy and predictable.  But it wasn't enough to taint how much fun I thought it was!",e21a17
f9ge1nm,"I think the political humor was supposed to signal the broader themes of the movie. All these people felt entitled to their dad's wealth, and also had this condescending and totally false attitude that they were each self-made despite the massive head start their dad gave them. Marta was ""family, but not *really* family"" despite being the closest to her dad, and the best of the lot of them. When money got involved, they stopped pretending to care about her - she was just an immigrant from who knows where who didn't deserve the money. But in reality, she was the one who actually took care of him and never wanted a penny she didn't earn - that's why she got the inheritance.",e21a17
f9f4771,"Idk I felt like the political aspect fit right in with this movie. Using the argument at the birthday as an example, neither of the two arguing knew anything they were talking about and were clearly talking out of their ass to make themselves sound smarter or better than the other. It to me was another way of showing they didn’t care about each other or anything except status and money. Also in that scene Walt is talking about how we should just let all immigrants into the country, but he’s the one that uses deportation as a threat later on.",e21a17
f9ibh7p,"I agree. Maybe if this had been sold as something else, my expectations for a good mystery wouldn't have been so high. But this really isn't a mystery, and I was disappointed.",e21a17

f8ulh3c,"Because in the the, the family only cares about themselves - that's the point of why they're so upset. It just adds an interesting layer of drama because the stakes are so high, and the death of Harlan to protect her family shows that he really, truly cares about people - take away the immigration narrative and the movie loses huge chunks of narrative weight.",e21a17

f9vpvs0,"I wouldn't have minded if they expanded on it a bit but I didn't get the impression that they didn't care for each other. I was really impressed at how much of their dynamic they conveyed in just a short scene.

I took the Go board discussion to be less that Marta didn't want to be there and more to show that they are comfortable with each other and have a sort of old married couple dynamic for lack of a better descriptor--they tease each other but underneath you can tell they have mutual affection.

Plus it was even more pronounced considering that every other interaction we see Harlan have is an argument with one of his entitled family members.",e21a17
fa0kjvd,"For this style of movie, One scene is all you need when every other scene of Harlan with other people is shown to be antagonistic and dramatic. If that's established to be his baseline attitude, then showing that he is more relaxed, playful and comfortable around Marta gives you everything you need.",e21a17
fa08h0s,"Marta says something along the lines of ""maybe it's not about liking me and more about not liking you""

Plus the pickup shots of her hanging out in his study while Harlan shows her about Don Johnson cheating and other personal family details; they were close. I don't know what more needed to be smashed over our heads.",e21a17

fj8q2tf,It is probably a Murder on the Orient Express situation. The true resolution is quite fantastical/convoluted such that the detective comes up with a modified version to give to police. Beniot's reputation would likely shield Marta from suspision/legal troubles as he could likely creatively explain her involvement away.

They revealed too much, too early and it was obvious that Ransom had something going on from the beginning. Most of the characters were one-dimensional and useless. All of their 'motives' were painfully generic. Did Riki Lindhome have more than one line? I almost forgot she was in it.

It felt like it tried to be a comedy first, and a murder mystery as an afterthought.",e21a17

f94wdoh,"I was Ready for something like that in this movie because all throughout, Johnson establishes throughout the movie that everyone has ulterior motives even if they may have good intentions. Plus it's a Rian Johnson movie, he loves being an troll. 

But ultimately, if she was revealed to be the mastermind, I think it would have been to the detriment of the conclusion. It wouldn't be as satisfying of an ending if she was guilty all along.

Remember Harlon is the kind of person who, upon realizing he has MINUTES to live, spends it first coming to the immediate conclusion that swapping the medicines would be a great way to kill someone, and then concots a ridiculous murder mystery plot surrounding it. If they really do think so similarly then it's likely that Ransom came to the exact same conclusion about the medicine when presented with his ultimatum and, rather than do the sensible thing like hiring a lawyer to contest the will, immediately went into murder mystery mode.",e21a17

fcmlauy,"Ransom is the obvious villain character, until he learns Marta's story and agrees to hide it.  There's no apparent reason for him to do this--we already think we know everything of how Harlan was killed.  The new tension is whether Marta will end up being accused of the crime.  So Ransom becomes the new love interest character.  And while he's still just a little too perfect, he's so charismatic (""Are you seriously flooring it?"") and his motives make enough sense that you kind of want him to be genuine so Marta can have someone nice in her life.

The movie is surprising because it shows you the murder halfway through the movie and everything about how and why it happened.  It seems completely airtight and it's hard to see how anyone besides Marta could be responsible.  So you sort of buy into the new tension being Marta getting away with everything.

The members on the left are portrayed as being very shitty and insincere in the brief parts of the movie that mention any sort of politics. 

If you interpret it as Jacob actually being an alt-right Nazi troll then I think it's fine that for a very minor character in a movie with a lot of characters there had to be just a bit of 'telling' and not 'showing' with him, but the way I took it was that those scenes were more about the family members calling him out than Jacob himself.",e21a17

But for most the movie, I was so impressed because I thought we were watching a flip on the whodunit where we already knew who the murderer was and the victim actually wanted the murderer to get away with it. So the excitement was seeing if the murderer could outsmart the cunning detective and the family so she could be free, which would be its own twisted form of justice and bring peace to Harlan.

Marta still ends up free and retains control over the estate, but I was slightly disappointed the movie turned into a traditional whodunit, with all these crossed arcs to explain what happened.",e21a17

Often, rather than the audience responding like, ""Oh, ho, ho! You got us good,"" they get indignant and angry and feeling like they've been taken for a ride. (Also see ""The Last Jedi,"" for example.)

I love that even after you think ""Knives Out"" is a twist on the murder mystery genre where the victim fakes his own murder, but not his death, Johnson still comes back with another twist in the final act to show that the setup to the intended murder really was a ""whodunnit"" mystery after all.

I dig that about his movies, even if it pisses other people off.",e21a17

Instead it reverted back into a standard whodunit in the end, with the standard character-we-know-the-least-about-being-responsible-for-the-murder twist. Things that I was hoping were red herrings to throw us off of what kind of movie we were ultimately going to get, just got revealed as actually being nothing more than very obvious clues as to the real solution to the murder mystery. Instead of going ""oh wow what a surprise"" I just thought ""Oh so I really was right an hour ago, oh well."" 

It was still entertaining, but, yeah",e21a17
fcmjadp,"Are you serious?  Ransom reacts to being told that the girl is alive by saying he'll barely take any time for attempted murder.  

If Fran is alive there'd be no reason to suppose he'd take ANY time.  Fran breaks the whole thing apart.  If she's alive, she clears him, bing badda boom.",e21a17
fcivon8,"I could go on. I think there are a few more clues in there, but some clear hints.

\- There's a visual clue that Marta is not who she is when she is walking through the garden the dogs come to her and the detective says that dogs are a good judge of character, immediately Linda arrives and the dogs flee from Marta to Linda, who Harlan calls ""My Heart"" in his letter at the end.- I think the Go board is representative of a persons ability to manipulate another. Harland being the person who enjoyed weaving storylines and plots the most enjoying to play, the 2 people who could beat him are  Ransom and Marta. Ransom even says so in the diner ""I always thought I was the only one that could beat him at Go. I always thought that meant something"" - I think this speaks not only to the persons ability to weave a plot but also endearment from Harlan. He even says it's strange for his grandfather to tell him she always beats him at Go.

\- Martas mom asking ""Are WE Rich"" - the same woman asking her daughter to be tactful and respectful in opening scenes is now asking if the family is rich, not Marta. I think this is both commentary and also a point of parity between them being poor and the rich family, both wanting to take money. There is a discussion that people need to come to the country and earn their way through work, but the family is clearly leaching the same way they accuse immigrants of. Also when Ransom is asking ""Why"" in the diner  Marta says ""He wanted you to build your own thing from the ground up"", which is what they are expecting immigrants to do, but they are angry when expected to do it themselves. This is also exposed as hypocrisy when the home was later exposed as bought off an immigrant.

I think Marta wormed her way into the family, sparked division and manipulated them all so she would inherit the money. She even manipulated the Detective to an extent, who saw her trying to pull back at times and intervened. He saw what she was doing but collaborated with her.When Harlan is telling Ransom that he is giving the money to Marta he says ""I am sane for the first time in my life"" - kinda classic for that type of situation. They actually all loved her. What if she was a lot more like those Hallmark movies and she was actually slowly drugging him, he even said he didn't take drugs earlier in his life and she even offers him drugs the night he dies and encourages him to take some ""Just a little"".

Possibly when she realised what Ransom had done she took advantage of the situation and out-played the family, particularly Ransom. Hell, Harlan also foreshadows Ransom's downfall saying there's so much of ""Me"" in him as she's beating him in go. He calls himself and Ransom confident, stupid, playing life like a game without consequences. Then says they can't tell the difference between a prop and a real knife - obviously Ransom's last failure. What if Ransom was the real threat in the family and needed to be dealt with? I think Harlan and Ransom's downfall are tied by Martas intentional actions.

I also think we are seeing things played out as Marta wants us too. We don't actually see Ransom do anything to the housekeeper, but the day of the funeral the housekeeper is talking to Marta about suicide after poisonings. She's talking to Marta after Marta might be guilty of poisoning Harlan ""I don't think he killed himself""...she tells her about her cousin at the . She's also talking about the hallmark movie, ""Deadly by surprise"", the same type of movies Marta's sister was listening to when we meet Marta. Something they watch often, Alice said ""It's normal TV"".

I'm still not 100% sure f Marta is a purposeful killer, but I think she is deadly by surprise. I think she wound up and took advantage of this situation looking to get rich. Seeing an opportunity and then taking advantage for her family.

But I can see a scenario where Marta finds out the housekeeper is onto something. Confiding in Marta, that she doesn't think Harlan killed himself, then describing a movie almost exactly like what happened. Right after that Marta has a panic attack and they go to the housekeeper's stash...this is where the medical records were hidden...records where the results were hidden and should have been clean.

But the bottom line; Marta is the bad guy. She came in and intentionally drove a wedge between Harlan and the family, getting him to leave her the fortune. I think we are seeing what she wants us to see. And I think the Detective is helping her, respecting her game, not letting her fail due to what he assumed is her heart and letting Ransom take the fall. I think the real Marta is revealed when we see Joni speaking to Harland, the dark figure in the background putting drugs in the syringe, not the crying girl who is crying.",e21a17
f9m2dwj,"There lies your problem: not liking a movie because the plot didn't go your way, when in fact the progression of the movie is obvious. In this movie, from the very beginning you know there has to be a mastermind behind the medication mixup because why would naloxone not be there? And an experienced  nurse confusing the medications should have to you suspect that there is a switch in the meds somehow. Also it is standard protocol to run tox report on suicide cases so of course the tox report is going to be a key evidence. That is obvious from the very beginning. The entire time the focus of the audience should be on who tampered with the med kit. No unnecessary twists at all, just detours. As for TLJ, from Episode 7 you should expect Luke to be in a despondent state because why else won't he come out and help if he is alive and well? From the very first interaction between Kylo and Rey it is obvious the Kylo was NEVER meant to be a villain and their connection is the center piece of the new trilogy. Rian Johnson stayed completely on point. As a new fan, watching episode 7, Rey's origins and Snoke's origins never stood out to me to be important. All the things that caught my attention was developed thoroughly by Rian Johnson. Next time, observe what the story is actually trying to say, rather than get fixated on your theory.

For me it was entirely the lack of suspension, with the third act just basically the tables turned on the villain, but we all knew he wasn't gonna get away with it in any shape or form, so it was just me sitting there, watching people pretending to be smart.

And the extensive cast of characters was just an entire family full of blatant red herrings who were all too flat to be interesting *as* characters, and I get what their roles as a whole was, but again, no tension. I didn't doubt for a second that none of them are going to get what they so want, and they weren't developed enough for me to even care, so all they ended up doing was feeling like unnecessary weight. Too many of them, all of them with too little substance or threat. I didn't care about any of them, despite the star-studded cast.

I did enjoy Harlan's character, surprisingly. On the surface, benevolent, 'old man regrets having raised his kids wrong, does one last act of charity for someone who *actually* needs it'. Below the surface, a family despot known to like playing games with people dependent on him, never raised his children to be their own people, now yanks the carpet from under them when they're all middle-aged with not much else going on for them, except Linda, I guess, and her marriage's now gone. Walt's out of the firm that's now owned by Marta, Joni's broke, Meg can't continue her education and will become a loan slave. Can't even remember the others.

Which, on one hand: welcome to reality. On the other hand, his kids not having their own legs to stand on was his doing as much as their own. So honestly, he wasn't really any different from his kids, and I thought it was a cool thing to watch unfold.

>  
>She claims to be too tired and having had champagne in order not to play the nightly game of Go. In other flashbacks she is shown clearly refusing champagne and marijuana. Is she lying? Is the entire puke-when-she-lies thing a lie?Every time she “pukes” it is in a container and “unseen” until the final reveal scene. She also pukes almost immediately in all other scenes, but holds it incredibly long during the reveal scene. Is it real or part of an elaborate plan?How does Blanc know about the puking thing? Was he told when he was mysteriously hired?During the putting-Harlan-to-bed scene, Harlan comments that cutting off Ransom and firing Walt and cutting off Joni & her daughter are all Marta’s ideas.Marta is the best Go player in the film. She is the best strategist. Better than Ransom. Better than Harlan.How long does it take to die of morphine overdose? Marta tells Harlan 10 minutes. This creates urgency that results in his suicide, yet when Fran is overdosed at the rundown laundry mat she’s still alive 2 hours later when Marta “finds” her.Donuts. There’s a hole. Donuts in donuts in donuts.The coffee cup. She has it on the tray at the beginning of the film when she “finds” Harlan. And in her hand at the end. If my theory is right, Marta is the only “self-made” person in the film.  Hard-working immigrant girl does good. In a shady way.Ransom as the villain is entirely contingent on Grandma’s testimony, but she can’t tell Marta apart from Ransom through a window in the dark, and Blanc’s conjectures. There isn’t a single shred of evidence against him, except a manipulated confession in which he says “so what, IF I did kill Fran, I’ll lawyer up and white, classist privilege will have me out in no time”. Not really an airtight confession, or true admittance of guilt.We only hear about Fran’s friend at the ME office through Marta.

The blood stain is probably just from him cutting his throat, I think someone said that blood is higher pressure in the neck area so it spurted
Those were older letter between her and Harlan, she doesn't know about the affair yet at this point.
The letter she revealed the text on at the end was the letter that Harlan threatened her husband with, I couldn't read it but I assume the main content was about the affair
The cops didn't go straight for the toxicology reprot since from the way the crime scene is set up, it looks pretty clear that he died by throat slitting, and the medical examiner wouldn't bother telling them about the toxicology report since there was nothing lethal in his blood so the cause of death is not out into question.

During his last moments, he said so himself that right before 10 minutes he should have been feeling the effects of the ""good stuff"" at the 8 minute mark but he was extremely lucid the entire time and even concocted an entire plan. He observed that morphine was an extremely effective way of killing someone and calmly remarked that there was no antitode and that it was a really clever method of murder. Ransom was his research assistant, the relative most nearly like Hugh, and the only person in his family to occasionally beat him in Go. Harlem knew exactly the kind of person Ransom was and even commented he couldn't tell a stage prop from the real deal. The reason why he killed himself was because he finally put an end to his affairs that day and knew for a fact that Martha was more than a match for Ransom. He was a ""drama mama"" to the end and had a death with quite a bit of flourish.

Edit: To add on to this, it's certainly suspicious that the plan Harlem gave to Martha was the exact same M.O. as Ransom. My personal conjecture is that Harlem knew that Martha would eventually be exposed because she's literally incapable of lying. However, he was clearly quite confident in Martha's abilities and character and trusted that she would eventually expose Ransom's murder attempt.

Why would Fran want to be alone with Ransom in the laundry mat when she believes he is a killer? How did Marta know to go through a hairdresser's to get to an abandoned laundry mat in the back?

fik8fs5,"His character was VERY important to the movie!

To me, the movie was about how a lot of Americans are in favor of immigration, up until it hurts them or their jobs. Marta was hard-working and way better to Harlan than any of his children, and, by Harlan's logic, she ""earned"" the inheritance. We can think of immigrants who come in, work hard, and contribute to the American economy/achieve the American dream as her.

A lot of us support immigration up *until immigrants threaten our jobs or way of live*. ALL of the Thrombeys turn on Marta. The Jaeden Martell character and his mother were the most openly racist and opposed to Marta (they were the only characters not pictured talking to Marta, save for Jaeden Martell's insult about her being an anchor baby.) You see some racism embedded in other characters, specifically the Drysdales. 

The dad hammered on and on about how Marta was working her way up to the American dream and deserved to be in this country, and yet, treated her like a servant (handing his plate to her) and being the first to demand she renounce her inheritance. Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis's character) was less openly bad about this imo, but she still made some off-color comments that hinted at conservatism/wanting to keep all the money to herself, even though she had done nothing to earn it and had her own business. At her core, she was still the same.

After the openly racist and likely conservative characters fall, we see the more sympathetic/""like us"" characters fall too. Joni prooooobably manipulates her daughter into giving them information about Marta (this would happen off-screen), and Meg, a character who seemed the kindest and most defensive of Marta (look at the beginning, where she tells the police calling Marta 'the help' to fuck off), turns her in and risks her mom getting deported because Marta will not renounce the inheritance. Marta has already told her she'll pay for her college and give her whatever she needs, but that is not good enough. 

Then Walt, who represents the American moderates (to me), goes and tries to strong-arm Marta into giving them her inheritance. 

Almost all of them say ""give back"" the inheritance. They all feel entitled to it, even though it was never theirs to begin with. None of them except Linda (who has already gotten a million-dollar loan) seem to be close at all to Harlan, except to get his money. Meg included, she's not even there for Harlan's cake cutting (normal for college girls to want to go see their friends, but if she viewed him as anything more than a distant relative, she'd have stayed.)

The movie encourages us to consider ourselves more harshly. The American dream doesn't belong to us for living here, it belongs to anyone willing to make an effort/work hard. 

As a side note, I'm a graduate student at a design school, and there are a good deal of immigrants here, as it's a widely-renowned school. I see this kind of garbage all the time with people I work with, as design is a fairly easy field for anyone with talent to break into, even if they don't have citizenship. 

I **loved** this movie because it captured all the hypocrisy many people in America have, even if they are supposedly leftist. The characters all look down on the ""creepy Nazi child,"" but prove they're not different than him. All of my friends and colleagues rightfully express a lot of distaste for the alt-right, but, when it comes to their jobs, say some borderline racist things (""you shouldn't be able to work at X unless you go to grad school,"" when a lot of immigrants get design credentialing from bootcamps, which are totally valid and worthwhile.)",e21a17

He was in the car with Marta looking at the flaming lab, then in the hilarious car chase, and then arrested. There's no exact time frame as to how long that all took, but there's no way he could have been at that address 10 minutes before 10am to inject Fran.

The only plausible thing I can think of is maybe he did meet Fran at 8am, after firebombing the lab, gave her a lower dose, and that killed her slower? I have no medical knowledge, so I don't know if it's a case of that exact amount 'overdose' Marta gave that kills in 10 minutes or if it's any overdose at all.

f9ulvcs,"1) The two of them had 10 minutes to react under a high pressure situation actually less since his step daughter came up to check on him.

2) I think Benoit suspected her but i'm not sure he thought she would have the courage to destroy evidence due to her vommitting thing. This point is the hardest to defend.

3) Fran section: She IS the idiot of the series of events. It's shown in t he flashbacks and in dialogue. She was loyal but into juicy mystery films/shows and drama. So she thought a covert meeting would work in her favor... like in the films. People do stupid shit ALL THE TIME IRL. Don't forget that not everyone is of average or greater intellect.

4) This wasn't so much as to stop the medical examiner from coming forward and more about to stop future questioning. Trials (especially murder trials) take months/years. By the time she'd been indicted and he was on the witness stand his testimony would be shaky.

5) Harlan LITERALLY 3 hours earlier announced what he was planning to do. And only 5-7 days before that set things into motion legally speaking. I'm pretty sure he didn't intend to die on the night of his birthday. Not everyone moves lightening fast, people sometimes drag their feet on going to their lawyer (and other specialists) to talk to them about marta's mom.

6) Harlan had always had a love/hate thing with Ransom, it's pretty clear he wanted to tell him personally so as to get him to strike out on his own. He DID start to cut ties (cheating thing, school fraud, publishing company, etc) and likely was going to sit them down all down more formally in the future. It seems you don't understand how decisions of this nature happen in the real world. You don't sit down meditate about an optimum strategy to prevent any situation where you might be killed. You often love or in this case, love hate your family. He clearly wanted to get a rise from Ransom (and might've been drunk/tipsy if i recall).

7) Doing a tip would likely cause more suspicion. Who the fuck calls in tips about a death in a private residence? It's not like this happened at night on a city street. If anything maybe Fran would be under high scrutiny because of her access to the bag even IF her limited recounting of the night even led to a confession. 

tl;dr i think you're nitpicking WAYYYY too hard. Way more stupid shit happens on the daily, a lot of the characters where in high stress situations and made mistakes and others are just simply done because that's how the character would've been acted e.g. Fran being a drama/tv show freak who wasn't the smartest. 

P.s. regarding the thing breaking apart, it's possible Ransom weakened it with climbing it earlier. Or that Maria could've stepped the metal ornament causing more leverage and thus a break while Ransom stepped on the wooden rungs.",e21a17
f9v45xd,"I gotta,

1.) Harlan killed himself in order to have the case ruled a suicide. In a perfect situation, there would have never been a report. To paraphrase, ""we will create an alibi to fool any usual police officer."" Ransom brought in Blanc, not your usual, and his insights led to the toxicology report impossibly being on the table--an outcome Harlan could never predict. EDIT: thinking about it more, this 'plot hole' is a major component of the plot... 

2.) This can be explained if you'll accept a subjective analysis. In classic murder mysteries, the *why* rivals the *who.* Very early on Marta implicated herself with the blood on her shoes--but also by assuring Benoit none of the family members are killers. His gamification early on can be chalked down to either wanting to understand Marta's motives, or as a way to coax her into giving concrete evidence. Just like with Ransom, however, Marta's goodness kept her from ever fully falling into his designs. EDIT: or, if you dislike subjective arguments... he wanted to find out who hired him. 

3.) Fran hated Hugh. She, Meg, and Marta were all good friends. She knew Harlan well enough to suspect he would never kill himself. When witnessing Ransom tinkering with the medicine, Fran--as the movie described--hatched a plan to bait both of Ransom and Marta, but tragically snagged the real killer first. She likely had a movie-esque plan of engaging the killer: accosting him, threatening him with her copy when things escalated to threats, forcing him explain how he did it. But Ransom was ""in for a penny"" and, tragically, not in the mood for conversation. After subduing her, he likely WANTED a perfect, implicating scene, but knew he had to copy Marta's presumed M.O from the first murder: morphine, medicine bag. Also, Ransom would have had much more control over the situation if he himself had been there when Marta entered the meeting spot; Benoit Blanc catching them meant Marta was alone to decide for herself how to act, and she chose to help. 

4.) Ransom's win condition was any scenario that ended in the slayer clause. Even if the examiner testified AFTER the fact, Marta's ""murder"" of Fran would indicate she had nefarious intentions with Harlan. What was important was keeping Marta in the dark for just a few more hours until everything fell into place. 

5.) Neither of these points really point to an ""idiot plot."" The scaffolding example can even be reversed by saying Ransom's climb ruined the scaffold's integrity for Marta. The grandma mistaking Marta is, albeit unlikely, a possibility. We never learn what her thinking was, too: she could have been saying ""Ransom?"" as in, ""where did Ransom go?"" Or she didn't know about the trick window, and was stupefied by family raining down. 

6.) The money came before and irrelevant to the events of the film. He trusted Marta to be able to navigate a *murder investigation* despite her condition and morals. It is not that far fetched that he had faith in her to handle the burdens of his estate. Also, there is no way to say he didn't plan to help her mother before passing. 

7.) Ransom hates his family. After their argument, you can even see how he goes off alone to brood. Instead of taking the advantage of rallying all these soon-to-be-jipped relatives in one place, he runs off to figure out his own solution. This is a plot point, not an idiot point. Notice how Harlan prepared blackmail for his other relatives, and kept then in the dark as to prevent THEM from telling. Ransom's reaction was already a part of his calculation. 

8.) Because Ransom has a rampaging ego that made him think he would be well out of danger with how ""incompetent"" Marta is. The point of the movie, to me, is what she says during her last Go match with Harlan: ""it's not about winning for me, it's about making a beautiful pattern."" She didn't want to win some game of wits or pull off the best coverup ever. She wanted to discover what she owed to this family, how to do right by everyone and atone for her mistakes. Unlucky for Ransom that Benoit considers that worthy of further investigation, whereas he himself can hardly comprehend her choices and thus sloppied an otherwise strong plan. 

I'm running off a single viewing, but there's zero chance of this being an ""idiot plot."" I think certain decisions--Ransom not telling his family, Fran's plan, and so on--are *motivated* acts of stupidity.",e21a17
f9uvejc,"Would they run a tox report on a clear open and shut suicide? Cause of death would be known: he slashed his own throat open. It's not so unbelievable to think they simply wouldn't run the blood, and without Ransom's meddling the police would have just closed the case after a couple of days.",e21a17
f9va5lv,"Your point about the toxicology report is specifically addressed in the dialogue, Harlan says ""I know there's something I missed"" but assures Marta that she can still win.

For many of these other points... what you call Idiot Plot is an example of character flaws and theming that are directly addressed in the text--mainly ""You won not by playing the game Harlan's way, but yours."" Harlan was obsessed with mysteries to a fault and couldn't resist making his death an overly convoluted ruse. They specifically say he would have survived if he hadn't gone through all the theatrics that set the plot in motion. And the same is true for Ransom, he probably would have been able to get away with it if he didn't try to arrogantly beat his grandfather at his own game. 

All of the Thrombeys were undone by their hubris, and Marta was able to win because she was honest and not interested in proving her dominance by trying outwit everyone.",e21a17
f9xutf1,"  

He would have definitely assumed. But he made sure he was seen alive my Walt on the stairs (Marta disguised as Harlan on the stairs) twenty minutes after the drug dose. So that disqualifies Marta’s involvement in the Morphine injection. The cause of death will still be suicide and not Marta’s supposed mistake in administering the medicine. 

Fran didn’t understand the report. Blanc says “The numbers means nothing to her, but if Ransom is guilty, its existence is a threat, so she photocopies the header and makes her blackmail note.”

 The Morphine was not injected the expert way or how a nurse or a medical practitioner would administer into the veins. It was injected in a struggle and behind her back. Plus, we don’t know whether Ransom managed to inject it all. Marta happened to be lucky in this case and Fran was still alive and bit conscious to inform her about the stash. 

Nice point about the Examiner officer’s testimony. The officer signs several reports in a day. It will all be dependent on his memory. One can challenge the report. Labs are obliged to keep remnant samples. The samples had to be re-tested again for confirmation but the whole lab was burned out destroying the remnant blood sample also. 

It was dark and grandma (like all aged people with poor eye-sight) just assumed that it was Ransom. You can see in the entire movie, Grandma only spoke when Ransom was around. May be she loved her a lot. At the night, she saw Ransom once and when she saw someone again, she assumed it was Ransom again.",e21a17
fa2nrmo,"There should never have been a toxicology report.  The lead detective mentions throughout the movie that it's an open-and-shut case of suicide, and none of the family members are shown requesting an autopsy.  If the state required an autopsy, the toxicology report still should have been of no interest to anyone, because everyone but Benoit was convinced it was a suicide. The police were ready to wrap it up and the family was (as Harlan no doubt anticipated) embroiled in family drama and, later, battling over the will. No on else thought twice about an autopsy report.

>Why would Benoit let someone he knows is misleading him destroy pretty much every piece of physical evidence right before his eyes?

He suspected Marta but had zero evidence against her and not even a workable theory.  Her alibi appeared airtight.  He couldn't have suspected she'd manage to sneak in a magnet to wipe the tape - that's some rare quick thinking.  And he didn't know to look for footprints because he didn't know there'd be conditions for it - when they reach the muddy path, he is clearly surprised and asks something along the lines of, ""Did it rain here recently?""  As soon as he realized, he called Marta back.  Up until he found out about the trellis and false window, he had no clue as to how she would have managed the murder and was probably hoping she would give something away due to panic or pressure.  He also didn't know if she was the actual murderer or just someone tangentially involved.

>Moreover, how would Fran

Anything to do with Fran can be chalked up to the fact that she's clearly shown not to be the brightest bulb in the tanning bed, and is someone who thinks the real world works the same way her Lifetime Originals do. As for Ransom's actions, I don't think he knows jack about medicine at all, and just gave her a random dose, uncaring of when exactly she died. All that mattered to him then was that Marta showed up with a dead Fran and a medicine bag and morphine in her blood to implicate Marta (as a tox report would definitely be done on Fran).

>What would burning down the medical examiner’s office accomplish when the examiner who prepared and filed the toxicology report could just testify to what he had put in the report?

Remember this is damage control.  This was not part of Ransom's original plan.  He did the best he could with what he had.  After all, who's to say that the lab tech would actually read the report?  Maybe they just send it off to the coroner and let the coroner deal with details, or even if a tech or coroner did look at the report who's to say the morphine level stood out?  Harlan was a rich man who apparently committed suicide.  Dosing himself with morphine prior to the act wouldn't have seemed all that unbelievable.  With no other concrete evidence, the police would have nothing to go on.

>If the grandma was so blind that she thinks a slight Cuban woman is her jacked, 6’0” great—grandson then how did she even recognize Ransom initially? Why would Chris Evans - who weighs at least twice as much as Ana de Armas - get up the scaffolding without issue but it cracks apart under her weight?

All grandma knew was that Ransom left in a huff.  She didn't know of anyone else leaving, and if she saw him come back once it's natural she'd assume that the next person to show up in that spot was the same person.  You could also easily say that it was Ransom's climb up the trellis that weakened the wood.  Harlan wouldn't have sent Marta up there if he thought the structure was at all compromised. 

> If the money he was leaving could negate the issue, why didn’t he just do that himself when he was alive before it would be subject to massive controversy?

Harlan himself said that he was just in the process of putting things in order.  He believed his will would be read after he died a normal death.  No controversy, no suspicion.  And yes, 60 million dollars is more than enough to make any immigration issue disappear.  I also felt that Harlan brought that issue up to Marta because he knew nothing else would convince her to go along with his plan, and he couldn't bear the thought of her going to prison or suffering for a simple mistake.  He was emotionally blackmailing her.

>Why would Harlan tell Ransom in advance that he was disinheriting everyone and not expect him to - at the very least - share that with the family? Why would he not just tell everyone at that point or, much more plausibly, tell no one?

Harlan liked his games, as mentioned several times in the movie, and he particularly liked playing games with Ransom, whom he felt took after him the most.  He also had no issue with confrontation.  So what if Ransom told everybody?  Don't forget Harlan also fired his son the night of the party.  He wanted to kick up a fuss.

>Why would the actual culprit hire a famously incisive private detective for his messy attempt at a frame-up?

Prior to the Fran complication, his attempt wasn't messy at all.  Every member of the family had motive to kill Harlan, but only Ransom was seen leaving the house and not coming back.  Marta was the likeliest scapegoat, and Ransom knew that when the will was read all eyes would turn to her and the family would be out for blood.  If Marta inherited with no issue, he thought he could easily weasel his way in with her and get a share of the money anyway (which very nearly happened).  And if Benoit caught on to Marta, slayer clause comes in to play.  Either way is a win for him.",e21a17

At the end the detective says he knows what he would do, in a certain tone, but then says she’ll do what’s in her heart. This implies she’s gonna help out the family. Most likely give a lot back.

The family's moral crime wasn't really that they were racist but rather that they benefitted from huge privilege only to react by blindly constructing hypocritical narratives whereby they had actually earned or were entitled to that privelege.

The key example in this being all the talk of the importance of work ethic and being self-made early on, only for the family to then be appalled when the hard working & self made Marta is given all their money. Their notion of being self-made later being further undermined by the fact that it all built on pre-existing money anyway. There was also another telling bit where Evans' character claims the mansion is their traditional family home, only for it to be pointed out that it was actually bought more recently. And finally we saw Walt's obviousness to the source of their powerful position as he tries to threaten and cajole Marta with influence that comes directly from the wealth she now possesses.

fca1c1h,">Why would Ransom expect Marta to realize that she had administered the wrong medicine, would discover the fact, and search for the antidote?

Because she's a nurse who (in Ransoms plan) was supposed to have given him the 100ml of morphene and would assumably recognize the symptoms of an overdose pretty quickly. He took the antidote to make her think she messed up and killed him (which is exactly what happened). The reveal being the switched labels made no difference - she wasn't as stupid as Ransom thought she would be.

>Marta, knowing Harlan is dying, accede to his wishes? Would not a normal person immediately call 911 or drive a dying person to the nearest hospital?

She did try calling 911, Harlan stopped her. He then kicks her out of the room and then when she changes her mind and goes back in, he kills himself.

> A call from the hospital relates that Fran is all right and will recover. With that misinformation, Ransom immediately and conveniently admits his guilt – rather far-fetched to do that immediately, and without a lawyer

It's a Murder She Wrote movie - it's a trope, but it's a trope popularized by this genre. It would be like ending a scooby doo episode with a lengthy legal battle over the lost profits of the haunted hotel. It's silly, but eh.

>Why did Ransom hire investigator Benoit? If Ransom framed Marta, why did he not ask for a toxicology report by himself? The film also has the investigator proving the guilt of his own client -- a first in murder mysteries.

He thought Marta would be as stupid and as greedy as they were, and he needed James Bond to suspect murder (since the police just thought it was suicide) to pin it on her. He thought once she was implicated (and based on her not being able to lie, which he found out when they played Mafia, the movie suggests he thought this would be a slam dunk), her being the reason he died would invalidate her right to the inheritance (the Slayer ruling). The only reason his plan got complicated was because A) Marta wasn't as bad at her job as he assumed B) He got caught by the other housekeeper.",e21a17
fccswns,"Harlan explains that the response time for the ambulance means he'd be dead before they could arrive (an interesting way to kill someone for a story plot).  The naloxone was removed in case Marta recognized the symptoms of an overdose before Harlan died.  The situation that played out was literally the reason it was removed, because otherwise Marta would have it and the overdose wouldn't have been a problem.  Harlan wouldn't have died if the naloxone was still in the kit.  

The plan was to have the overdose administered, then switch the labels back so that it looked like Marta had given Harlan an overdose.  Joni mentions ""the slayer rule"" after the will reading when the family is trying to contest the will.  Marta couldn't inherit anything if she was responsible for Harlan's death, so murder or manslaughter would have invalidated the new will.  It only mattered that Marta had caused his death, so as long as the investigation concluded Harlan was going to die due to overdose the family could have lawyered up.

Benoit was hired because Harlan's death was being classified as a suicide.  Harlan tried to make it look as much like that as possible so that ""the average cop wouldn't think twice about it""(paraphrasing).  Ransom needed Benoit to dig deeper so the overdose was discovered and Marta took some blame.

A lot of your problems are actually in the exposition of the movie.

The weakest part of the story is Marta being held responsible for Harlan's death when he actually committed suicide.  She might be at worst guilty of medical malpractice, or some convoluted version of manslaughter.

fa0f8zn,"First off, I'm procrastinating writing a paper so I'm going to respond to this. It is explained in the movie that Harlan plays that board game with her every night. After the party, which went late into the night, almost midnight to be exact, Harlan wanted to play the game, but I'm sure Marta was tired and not feeling it, but decided to play anyway. She always treated Harlan with kindness and there's a big difference between ""being callous and rude"" and playfully bantering with a close friend. It's also very clear that Harlan trusted Marta because he tells her all the family secrets. Also we can see her kind nature in private when she calls 911 for Fran instead of leaving her to die.

Also, if you're going to claim that Marta caused Harlan's death, you're so so wrong. Marta tried not once but twice to call 911, which if Harlan had let her, he would still be alive because Marta had given hime the correct dosages of Morphine and whatever other drug he was taking. This is explained as Marta, being a good nurse, instinctively could tell the differences in tenacity of the two drugs. 

As for Marta's mother not liking the attention, she was in America illegally. Attention to her could cause the whole family to be deported. She's not talking about not liking the money, she doesn't like the attention. Also, if you were to randomly come into an extreme amount of wealth, you would be just as excited as her sister was.

I’m sure many out there may disagree with me but that movie felt so *not* Star Wars that even though he’s clearly a talented writer/director, I just don’t think he’s a good fit.

Sorry to hear about your family situation, sounds tense. The characters in the film are somewhat different in that Harlan Thrombey did make all his money himself.

Hopefully, I can answer. 

Ransom (Chris Evans) switched the labels on the vial. The purpose of this was to trick Marta into giving Harlan the morphine instead of the ketorolac (his normal medicine). Later, he'd go back in and switch the labels back, so it would look like Marta had done it on purpose, killing Harlan for the inheritance.

But, after the bottles were dropped on the floor, Marta picked up his normal medication and gave him the normal amount. She didn't look at the vial labels (which is very bad nursing), she just noticed how it felt and knew, instinctively, that it was the right medication, even though it was labeled as Morphine.

She didn't have it injected directly into her veins. He just stabbed her with it. Absorbing through the veins is much faster. Through the muscle it takes longer",e21a17
f9ieiyr,Harlan didn't account for the toxicology report because he (correctly) assumed the police would rule it a suicide.

Was it a different amount of morphine (it seemed like Marta did two separate injections with Harlan)?  The fact that Fran wasn't injected directly in the vein?

The fish are distributed in the U.S. by Mondelēz International. The fish-shaped candy gained enough popularity on its own to where the Malaco, and later Cadbury, company had to do little advertising for the product, until this past decade. A recent resurgence in popularity has resulted in greater accessibility in supermarkets and convenience stores where they are often sold prepackaged in plastic bags. Building upon this resurgence, the company recently created ""Giant Fish"" television advertisements and a ""Treadin' Water"" YouTube mini-series, which follows the miscellaneous adventures of four friends and a Giant Swedish Fish sharing an apartment. The first few episodes of the mini-series were published onto YouTube on May 9, 2016.[9]

Originally colored red with a flavor unique to the candy (often guessed to be lingonberry, but never verified), they are now also available in several different colors, such as Orange & Lemon-Lime. Purple Swedish Fish in grape flavor were discontinued in 2006. The fish come in two different sizes. Initially, the smaller fish came only in red; now fish of both sizes are available in all flavors. According to a visit to the factory on the Food Network's show Unwrapped[citation needed], green is not lime, but pineapple flavor, while yellow is a lemon-lime flavor.

1. Blanc says to Marta ""The medical examiner was ready to rule this a suicide, but Elliott agreed to keep it pending for forty eight hours.  Tomorrow morning I search the grounds and the house, begin my investigation.  I want you to be by my side for it.  My confidant, my eyes and ears. ""

He didn't ask to hold the body. The body was already buried. He asked to hold the report, rather the ruling of the report.  

Excerpt from the script at the Burnt Medical Examiner's office:

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT: Five AM, security systems here was all triggered.  It went up quick. Blood stores, records, all gone.  No employees around, thank god. 
BLANC: Any surveillance cams?  
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT: And speaking of security, the security tape from the Thrombey residence was scrambled.   
BLANC: What was still pending from the autopsy? 
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT: The report on the blood work. 
BLANC: Blood work? 

So it wasn't that Blanc requested Blood Test. Infact he happens to learn that a blood test was done.

fjyfaip,"Not the guy you responded to but it's clear from how the characters are set up at the start that Evans did it, and Harlan literally explains the twist in the scene where he's dying - I didn't even think about the bottles being switched until Harlan started spitballing and talking about how it's a great way to kill someone. The other family members are all introduced together as well as there being almost no focus/development on them after the first 30 minutes, and Evans' character is more mysterious and absent indicating he has a different/more important role to play in the story. I knew he had done it maybe halfway through the movie when he talks about finding ""clarity"" and then says he'll help Marta if she gives him his inheritance - it shows that he's still selfish and just wants the inheritance. 

Also, from a story writing standpoint, there's no satisfaction or payout in Marta actually being caught and subsequently arrested for Harlan's death (the resolution of the first mystery - who killed Harlan?) so the resolution of the second mystery (who hired Blanc?) will lead to the ""real"" ending. You can rule out the other family members - as the detective literally says in the first 30 minutes of the movie - and Marta which leaves the suspects as being Blanc, Fran, and Ransom (from the point of the viewer). There's no focus on Fran so she most likely didn't kill Harlan, Blanc has nothing to gain, and that leaves Ransom. By the hour mark, if you already suspect the bottles being switched, the most likely culprit is Ransom through that process of elimination and by shifting focus of the movie.

tldr: It was a very good movie, but I don't think the hints were that subtle as they're almost entirely all **told** to the viewer so they're nearly impossible to miss.",e21a17

It mirrors their relationship, that it was never a contest or power struggle between them, just friendship. Ransom was similar, except where Marta's relationship was friendly his was openly adversarial, something Harlan clearly respected on some level (as opposed to the fakeness of the rest of the family).

And then the fact that he wasn't even beginning to notice that he had been overdosed (he wouldn't go from not feeling it at all to keeling over immediately right at the 10 minute mark). I honestly was surprised that he actually killed himself, I thought he realized he wasn't ODing and he was going to warn her that someone was trying to kill him and that her accidentally switching up the vials saved his life. When it came to revealing Chris Evans I also didn't really find it that surprising because they were not subtle about any of the hints. The thing about the dogs barking in the middle of the night and then the moment Chris Evans enters the dogs start barking at him. He goes out of his way to be an asshole to anyone and everyone but then decides to ""rescue"" the girl who just inherited his family fortune and doesn't even pester her about it in the slightest (seems pretty out of character unless something else is going on). Then him getting her to eat because he remembers that she can't lie without throwing up from playing mafia with her years ago (and him mentioning that he was also good at go) shows that he is definitely intelligent enough to pull off an extraordinary crime. Then, possibly the most obvious part of it all, him acknowledging that he knows about the exact medications his grandfather takes and that he knows switching them would kill him. Then the fact that Marta receives the tox report but the results are conveniently covered up (at the time Evans was the only one who would know that Marta switched the vials, so it would only make sense to cover up the results if the results were in fact clean. Also lets not forget the pretty large plot hole that a lab is advanced enough to be able to do a tox report but isn't advanced enough to digitize and backup results?).

I do agree that overall it was a solid movie. I was very much entertained by the movie, and i loved the acting, the characters, the pace, and the cinematography. I just thought the plot was very mediocre to sub mediocre. I honestly thought the biggest twist of the entire movie was that there was no twist at all, the most obvious ending that they foreshadowed throughout the entire movie (that Marta was set up, and that the set up was by Chris Evans) ended up coming true. To me, this kind of kills its rewatchability because the best part about movies with a good twist is going back and seeing the all the little details that were imperceptible or insignificant the first watch through but make sense once you know the ending. I would've loved if it had been something crazy like Marta was the actual murderer and that she elaborately set Chris Evans up  because she found out he switched the vials and that the sweetness/throwing up when she lies was all an act to take advantage of the family.",e21a17

fi7ugf4,"The meds were prescribed to him. It’s not a breach of care to leave a patient’s medications with them even if they could be overdosed on. Chronic pain patients frequently fill prescriptions of opioids that would kill them if they took too many. They sell 500 pill bottles of tylenol at the supermarket. 

They accused her of influencing him anyway, it’s inevitable that they would seeing as he left all his assets to her. As the plan was, if a tox screen was done, it would appear that someone drugged him and then slashed his throat to make it look like a suicide. It doesn’t make any sense to take a lethal dose of morphine and then slash your throat. The suspicion would immediately fall to the person who administers him drugs. In my version of the plan it just looks like an 85 year old man was tired of life, felt he had tied up his loose ends and waited until he was alone to make a peaceful exit.

Actually this poses an interesting legal question. If you give someone a lethal dose of something and then they kill themselves before the substance kills them, is that homicide? Attempted homicide? But it was unintentional, and there’s no such thing as attempted manslaughter. Hmm.

Either way, I’d bet that they’d be more likely to win a judgement in civil court in the throat slashing scenario. In the intentional OD scenario I don’t see them prevailing by a preponderance of the evidence. Taking a bunch of morphine and then slashing your throat is bizarre. Intentional OD is basically the most common form of suicide for anyone prescribed opioids.",e21a17
fi9cgsc,"Don’t know who downvoted you. I agree with some of your criticisms and disagree with others. My first thought during the death scene was the same as yours, if he had been given 100mg of IV morphine he should be nodding out by now. But I figured movies getting drugs wrong is practically a trope and they were just taking a little artistic license. A large man of intelligence with a tolerance to opioids could probably manage to slur out a plan. The final twist, of course, reveals that he in reality had not been given any morphine, so his lucidity and able-bodiedness is explained in-movie.

I don’t know why you don’t understand Harlan’s motive, though. Throughout the movie it’s made clear that Marta has been Harlan’s closest friend and confidant for some time. He respects her intelligence above that of his family’s because he can’t beat her at Go. Though he may love them, the rest of his family sucks up to him for his wealth; Marta genuinely cares for him with no ulterior motive. He’s recently made the decision to leave all his wealth to Marta and cut his family off entirely, even telling Ransom. He cares for Marta deeply, and sees her as a genuinely good person, or he wouldn’t have left her all his assets. It’s also not just about Marta—her mother would be deported, and as Harlan says, her family would be broken. He knows that’s it’s not fair that Marta’s life and family will be ruined over this while his own family members skate through life and never have to take responsibility for anything.

He’s already told family members that he’s cutting them off. He told Ransom that the entire family won’t get a dime. He’s made up his mind that this is for the best. Now one simple, genuine mistake by his closest friend is set to derail it all, to completely undo everything he had resolved to do, and destroy his friend and her family’s lives. There’s no time to change his will—he knows that if Marta is held responsible for his death all his money will go to his family. He can either die knowing that everything he wanted will be undone and his family will live out their life as spoiled brats, or he can die saving his friend and her family and ensuring his last wishes are fulfilled.

I was also disappointed in some of the ensemble cast. I felt Lakeith Stanfield was wasted in his role. They gave him nothing to work with. Toni Collette wasn’t great, Don Johnson isn’t a great actor, but I know guys like his character in real life and they have this kind of faux, acting vibe that weirdly made his not-great acting click for me for that character. I thought Michael Shannon was playing a psychopath with barely-contained rage, but an impotent one. He has some great lines when he’s yelling with the family. Then when he confronts Marta, he’s very intimidating, but he’s not clever enough to blackmail someone properly, so he gets it turned around on him and when Marta slams the door he just kind of weakly calls after her. Jamie Lee Curtis was obviously very good. Walt’s son has like five lines and one of them is to call someone a liberal snowflake and another is to call Marta an anchor baby. I’m pretty sure he just comes across better because he’s hardly in the movie. Agreed on Chris Evans, I generally dislike him but his character was fantastic.

I thought the movie was very funny. But it’s not a genre of humor that everyone enjoys, and that’s fine.",e21a17

The opportunity, was to have her aware that something was up in the first place. That she would have seen that the label was switched and the viscosity of the medication didn't match the label, so she was basically playing along until Harlan's move of cutting his own throat. 

It'd be the rough equivalent of saying, ""You didn't wreck this cake - you're an excellent baker. You knew that whipping the egg whites to stiff peaks was the right move, even after you added those yolks"", when any baker worth their salt will know that the second you add any significant amount of yolk to the white, no amount of beating will ever get said egg whites to stiff peaks.",e21a17

* When Harlan is losing, he flips the board. When he thinks he's dying, and his plans to disinherit his family are going to fail because of a simple mistake, he ""flips the board"" and concocts a plan for Marta to still inherit the money.
* When Marta plays Go, she's only trying to make beautiful patterns. While everyone else is trying to get Harlan's money, or plotting murders - she just wants Harlan to be happy and her mom to be safe. She ""wins"" by playing her own game - being a decent person and a good nurse.

f94z2tc,"The only thing I've liked of his that I'm aware of is his two Breaking Bad episodes.  IIRC, he did the fly episode and the one where Skylar walks into the pool.  Both great episodes, but nothing that really blew me away.

It wasn't until I saw the trailer for Looper that he went on my radar. 
Time travel stories are, hands down, my favorite stories so I was more psyched for Looper than maybe any other movie that year.

And it might be the worst time travel movie I've ever seen. And then he tried to play it off by saying, ""time travel is just the thing the starts the story, it's not a main part"" which was utter and complete horseshit as time travel was used at every point in the movie. 

And none of it.  NONE OF IT made sense. That fucking line about ""I remember what you do after you do it."" or the stupid fucking ""walking down the street as I lose my limbs"" scene.  

What I'm trying to say is after Looper, he kinda fell off my radar until I heard about him getting TLJ.

I don't really care for anything Star Wars related that doesn't have Filoni involved, so I really don't have a dog in the fight in regards to Last Jedi.  But I honestly thought the movie was pretty fucking stupid and despite thinking all the Star Wars movies are pretty stupid, I 100% understand where the hate for this movie comes from.

f8vv4cb,"No, I got that, I address it in my fourth point. It's just that neither the audience nor Marta knows that the vials were switched/unswitched for the majority of the movie, so it seems that Marta is simply trying to avoid responsibility for her supposed medical negligence. And while I do like the tragic twist that Harlan killed himself to protect Marta from nothing, his intentions are noble but  hers aren't. IMO I think it would've worked better if Marta knew at that moment she had been set up (while still not realizing she had unswitched them), Harlan kills himself to protect her (still unaware over nothing) to buy Marta some time to uncover the mystery of who set her up before the inevitable toxicology report arrives.",e21a17

f9h7wp0,"I understand it's a deconstruction that wants to utilize all the tropes. I have no problem with that concept itself. My problem was that those tropes weren't used in a way that felt fresh or interesting, and unlike scream, which was still horrific and mysterious despite it's satrizing elements, this movie didn't foster much tension or mystery. 

Your point on toxicology is fair. I still think it would have been natural for another script to mention it somehow much earlier, because it was being done from the beginning whether the cops believed suicide or not (it could've come up in early discussions between the cops when they were arguing over murder / nonmuder). That it was ignored for so long became very suspicious to me as a viewer and only solidified the first thought as to what would clear Ana de Armas' name.

I get that they tried to give Evans viable motivation. But he was too in control of every situation after the diner scene, asked leading questions, knew things that shouldn't be immediately memorable too easy. And his choice to give up Ana so readily was the nail in the coffin. 

Ultimately a lot of this boils down to personal opinion. Sure, like any mystery movie, there's lots of little clues together that tie things together. But without a compelling mystery behind them I don't think a rewatch will have me any closer to being impressed. I would not call this script masterful. Competent, absolutely. Good, I can buy. Nothing beyond that.",e21a17
f9fz965,"This is a “mileage may vary” kind of thing.

flfp6ph,"Just watched this last night and the reason it was clear he wasn't overdosed was because the medicine meant to save him in case of an overdose was missing. If we assume she wasn't sloppy/poor at her job, it means her bag was tampered with. Why would someone tamper with it and remove that medication specifically intended to avoid a morphine overdose? The likely answer was that they swapped the medications, intending for her to poison Christopher Plummer. If they swapped the medications, that meant she accidentally gave him the correct stuff. Will say that Craig's explanation for why she did so was a nice touch.  


To me the film fell apart when her car was broken and Ransom just happened to pull up with a car to collect her. When he also had a plan mapped out to interrogate her, it became clear he had thought a lot of things through. His leaving early, her car breaking down, his pulling up right as the family was getting agitated and she was very reasonably trying to run away... it was too coincidental. The only way he could have planned that far ahead was if he knew what was in the will, which meant he had a motive to both kill his grandfather and frame the nurse.   


Wasn't expecting the blackmail storyline but it didn't do much to throw you off the scent. You had to know what was in the toxicology report the moment it entered the plot. Just as one last clue... wouldn't a toxicology test have been performed on someone who took their own life?

What a good nurse would have done is call 911, monitor, and give CPR when he stops breathing. A good nurse would not tell a patient they are going to die when there are still viable treatment options, leave the patient to die, then try to cover it up. The fact that the patient told her to do those things is irrelevant, in this case it would be her professional obligation to ignore Harlan's request.

 at the start of the movie she is offered an alcoholic drink and marijuana but refuses both then later when it recounts her bringing Harlan up the stair and he insists on playing Go she tells him that she's had too much too drink.

Even if it was a little lie to placate him she did not puke, also when she gets the call from the hospital about the housekeeper's condition she turns her back on the camera. I think, due to her being an RN, she knows what drug to take to make herself throw up on command.

fdezxm0,"The knowing by weight/viscosity was an unconscious thing. In the moment, she got it right by ""feel"" without even realizing what she was doing -- she accidentally grabbed the wrong vial after the mix-up, but everything felt right so she went through with it. Had she instead pulled the liquid from the properly-labeled vial, she would've known that something felt ""off"", and then would've checked the vial, confirmed that it was the right liquid by the label, then would've shrugged to herself and gone ahead and administered an actual lethal dose of morphine. So she didn't trust her skills so much that she would disbelieve black-and-white evidence when confronted with it (we saw this after she read the labels after administering the shot), it's just that she was good enough to get it right without reading. Once she read the vial, she believed she had gotten it wrong.

Her effort to meet her duty to help was in desperately trying to find the antidote. When she couldn't, she knew as well as he did that calling 911 was simply a meaningless gesture. Now whether that's a realistic real life situation (that she knew with 100% certainty he would be dead within 10 minutes, and that there was no possibility for him to survive to 20 minutes when the ambulance would've arrived), well I have no idea. But under the reality posited in this movie -- where both characters fully believed that there was no way for him to survive until the ambulance came, then there's no moral culpability in her acceding to his desire not to call the ambulance.

On the not fessing up, you're right, that's a not-good-thing that she did, along with misleading the cops and fleeing in the car. She had good reason for those things though, which was to protect her mother. And the harm to others in those actions is all minor at best.

Ransom switched the labels on the bottles thinking she would administer the medications as labeled, but she drew up and injected the correct medicine without looking at the label because she had done it so many times. She looked at the bottle after the injection, saw the switched label, and incorrectly believed she had given the wrong drug. The fact that she recognized she had given Harlan what she thought was morphine right away and never gave him drugs from the second vial alerted Ransom to the fact that she had in fact given him the correct medicine and that the toxicology report would be clean - he knew this without seeing the report based on her account of what happened, which is why he tried to destroy all the toxicology evidence that would contradict her confession.",e21a17

You are missing the point that its been ruled a suicide, the Medical examiner has done the checks and there's nothing to suggest its murder. There is no police investigation.

Blanc is only there as a PI and there's nothing the cops can do to remove him if the family invited him into the house as they want to find out if Harlan was murdered. As one of the cops is fan-boying maybe that's why the cops are hanging around him during HIS investigation.

>Why would Fran want to be alone with Ransom in the laundry mat when she believes he is a killer?

True but maybe she thought she would be safe telling him there was a copy somewhere that he would not be able to find if he killed her.

>Why would Marta trust Ransom and get in his car, and why would she confess to him anything?

Pretty obvious she was completely freaked out and he was the only one who didn't care when the will was read and she probably felt she could trust him.

There was no sense in slitting his throat and complicating things further up. A clear case of suicide - Morphine overdose and days later blood report confirming morphine overdose. Simple. 
2. Ransom would surely want to know whether his plan worked or not. He would surely check the bottle and made sure whether Morphine was injected or not especially when things got twisted after he found  that Harlan supposedly died by slitting his throat.",e21a17
f9o66ok,">He decided to slash his throat because it was quicker and less painful than the way he believed he was going to go.

Even if it's more painful, I could see Harlan's reasoning being to try to draw attention away from the toxicology report by doing something that's both so dramatic and clearly the immediate cause of death; the police treat the toxicology report as a formality anyway and would have ruled it a suicide before seeing it. 

Obviously, they still *do* run a toxicology report, but then I'm not sure how much we're meant to read Harlan's actions as completely well-reasoned; he was calm, but was focused on clearing Marta and the fact that he thought he had a few minutes left to live, so he didn't quite think it through (if he had, he'd probably have realized that he didn't feel like he was going through a morphine overdose).",e21a17

Now, I know that Harlan _wasn't_ shot up with 100ml of morphine (because Ransom switched the medications in the bottles) but I don't know why Marta wasn't at least more confused -- I would have expected her to expect Harlan to keel over in a narcotic daze, or at least be slurring his words or something.

f9uv77o,"Thanks for the detailed response. I'll try to keep my counter-points brief

1. Sure, it's hard to think clearly under pressure. **But** this movie made quite a point of showing Harlan to be impeccably calm and calculating in this instance as he swiftly unfurled a very detailed plan of action while ignoring the obvious, glaring issue that analysis of his body would show the massive dose of morphine and render the rest pointless (or worse, given that he's now encouraging her to obstruct justice). This is just too big and crucial a point for his character to plausibly overlook
2. He lets her ruin the tape, step all over the footprints, and remove evidence from the vicinity while gaining next to nothing from her assistance. He knows she can't lie - why on Earth wouldn't he just ask her a series of questions rather than letting her continually tamper with his crime scene?
3. I'm willing to accept that Fran is just an idiot character, but why would she leap to the **correct** conclusion Ransom was attempting to poison Harlan if all she knew was the toxicology report was clean and he died from a knife wound? It had to be that way to make Rian's narrative work, but it doesn't make any sense in context
4. I would imagine the ME would be asked in a reasonable timeframe whether the very high profile celebrity death he had just handled had been examined before the arson - especially when the obvious intention of the arson was to interfere with the investigation. When he plainly states the tox report came back clean it sort of immediately collapses the whole scheme to frame Marta for poisoning Harlan
5. That's fair, but it's a bit strange that he's shown to be willing to go to insanely dramatic lengths for the sake of Marta's mother but never offered to help her previously. Kinda undercuts the plausibility of him caring so much about where she happens to live that he traumatizes his own family with a graphic suicide
6. I'm not saying Harlan should've expected to be killed, but why would he think Ransom would keep it a secret? If/when Ransom tells everyone, the family would be harassing Harlan and Marta endlessly over the will, up to and including threatening to report her mother's illegal immigration status. It's pretty contrived, you must admit
7. I fail to see how an anonymous tip to the local PD is going to arouse more suspicion than a mysterious $10,000.00 anonymous payment to a famous PI haha

Won't fight you on the scaffolding, you're right that that's a nitpick, but several of the above tie very crucially into the central mysteries introduced and it seems like there was a lot of lazy outs taken. Still a fairly fun little flick carried by its likable leads, but it sort of requires you to 'turn your brain off' as it were to get much out of it, which is puzzling to me when I see it described as so ""clever"" or, worse, ""ingenious"" by people who should know better",e21a17

f9v27xh,"Toxicology reports are routine in the event of an untimely death, especially in cases of suicide where drugs and alcohol are involved; Harlan was giddily drunk at the time of his death and was in good spirits inviting investigation. Sure enough, the report was being generated before Benoit ever got involved. 

If Harlan and Marta had been correct about the poisoning, their harebrained scheme would've seen her go from just not inheriting a gratuitous windfall to actively serving time for murder, obstruction of justice, evidence tampering and more, given how much she overtly incriminated herself without ever even so much as acknowledging the inevitable forensic conclusion. Now sure, her character wasn't too bright, but Harlan was said to be and this is a pretty massive oversight compounded by the fact that it's never brought up by either of them before the inane blackmail subplot begins",e21a17
f9uvefm,Never said she did. Strange comment,e21a17
f9uw41b,"Well, I'd contend that the fun of a good mystery is that you can solve it if the characters behave in rational ways, and that was sort of undercut here by the shoddy writing. It's still easy to predict a bunch of the 'twists' here like the prop knife and the cliche tricked confession at the end, but the mid-movie reveal of his death is sort of preposterous when he's trying to cover up an accidental poisoning in a manner that in no way would conceal that he was poisoned. 

I'd also like to point to Scream as an example of a film that was playing with the tropes of an unrealistic genre but still managed to have its characters have fairly lucid motivations that didn't immediately collapse under the barest scrutiny",e21a17

fcaxac0,"I think she gives them nothing.  She earned what she got by working hard and being honest, and the only time she was dishonest or misleading was to protect someone else - not herself.  

Not only are they shitty to her in general but she winds up being party to three key scenes with the family.  One is the illegal immigrant debate where the family is arguing and a key theme is that immigrants should come here and earn their way from the ground up.  Even the characters who are more favorable towards illegal immigrants in that scene are ready to drop their supposed values and weaponize that against her when she stands between them and the money.  The second scene is at the will reading when most of them are going hard at Ransom when he reveals he was cut out of the will and saying that he’s been draining and using the family for too long and that being cut off will be his chance to grow as a person.  The third scene is when Ransom mentions to her that literally none of the family has built what they have from nothing, they were all leeching off of what Harlan had built. 

In my mind she observes all of that and the way they treated him in life and her both before and after the inheritance and finds that the right thing is to make them do what they spent the first half of the movie grandstanding about.  Not as an act of revenge, but because it’s the right thing to do.  But I do think that had they been the least bit emphatic towards her she probably would have given them a substantial amount of money and supported them out of guilt earlier on in the film.  By the end though?  I think she can look at them, sip her coffee, then go back in her house and never think about them again.  

I really appreciated the social commentary and criticism that this movie flung at both sides of the isle.  You have the rich conservatives arguing that immigrants should have to work to build something they inherited, not appreciating or the acknowledging the advantages their wealth and status granted them ahead of everyone else.  You had the rich liberals seemingly saying the right things but really being completely empty and disingenuous when their status is threatened.  And the kids.  Oh, the kids. You have the college SJW liberal who befriends an immigrant and helps her when it’s at no cost to her and even argues they should respect Harlan’s wishes but when she realizes that her stake(in this instance her tuition money) is at risk immediately betrays those values and throws her under the bus by revealing her mom’s illegal immigration to the family.  And, of course, you have Reddit’s own alt-right troll.  He literally does almost nothing active in the entire movie except be incredibly unpleasant/shitty/racist and troll on the internet and jerk off, like the oh so vocal all talk people we find on so many subs here.",e21a17
fe4dd3u,"That's a good point. 

The usual suspects is a good example of a movie that doesn't narratively explain the twist. It's build in and the audience realized the hook same time the cop did. 

Kind of the same with oldboy. We learn about the trap same time the main character does. This time it is explained but it just feels different. It doesn't feel like it's being explained to the audience like it did in knives out. 

I dunno. Maybe I just didn't like it. 

Oh well.",e21a17
fe4p2re,That's what I loved about it. A good twist is foreseeable by those paying close attention. A good twist shouldnt *only* come as a shock but also make sense given the rest of the movie. Any twist that relies on nothing but shock value is a shitty twist.,e21a17

fa0924y,"Not if she so brilliantly planned it so that she wouldn't need to lie about anything. Setting the events in motion before the film started, letting the family pick itself apart. Dropping enough bread crumbs so that ultimatly one of them would snap, and bump him off, leaving her to inheriting the lot.

It's a stretch, I'll give you that, and maybe on second watch I'll think it's nonsense, but still, I'm running with it until I'm convinced otherwise.",e21a17
f94ig5v,"Along these lines I got a bit confused in the final reveal. It was like Blanc was preparing his arm for an injection (rolling up just 1 sleeve, laying his arm out on a chair). And then states something like ""Marta you can tell the drug by the tint of the liquid instinctively"" and peels away the label he covered up (they showed him taping it up). And this was proof she administered the correct drug all along? 
Did I miss her identifying the drug? Was Blanc just rolling up 1 sleeve of his shirt and laying it out for a shot on a chair randomly? It felt like a missing scene of setting up for Marta to administer a drug to him and correctly identifying it as proof she could do it. Or am I missing something?",e21a17

But I'm just arguing that she either knew or had a feeling how the family would act, even Harlan. And all she did was let pieces fall where they did. She just outmaneuvered Harlan's terrible family. And at worst let a sick old man die with some dignity, instead of wasting away, something he would not have wanted.

Pretty suspicious that they had Ransom note her ""Throw Up Lie Detector"" while they were eating at the restaurant, weird how he mentioned some type of party where he learned of it. How long did the family know of her lie detector? She also lied multiple times but threw up when it helped her most. At least that's where I landed, might have to watch it again to have concrete support as in ""In this scene she"".

Marta caused Harlan's death. Remove Marta from the equation and Harlan wouldn't be dead. It doesn't matter what her intentions are, but what her actions caused.

Classifying Jacob as Alt-Right (as if anyone can actually agree on what that term means outside a media-driven scapegoat for anything “woke” culture doesn’t approve of) does nothing other than politically grandstand, which the film does throughout (sometimes cleverly, others not so much).

His character serves no purpose - literally. I’m surprised the actor, with some visibility behind him,  took the role, considering how irrelevant it is. They could have left him out and all the film would’ve suffered was one less jab at the Alt-Right demon (or the supposed Nazis trolling American streets 🙄).

As it is, the inclusion of his character and claims made about him were meaningless without some kind of action on his part that justified the vitriol. We never saw it. He was literally in the background staring at his phone every moment we saw him. His character was framed completely by the quick condemnation montage from the virtuous family females - one who was a thief and another who tried to manipulate an individual for her gain.

When the mentioned the 'slay rule' I had an 'ah ha!' moment... but then no one in the family seemed to get too excited about the idea (the scene ended with them going, ""...maybe we get her to renounce the inheritance?""), so even then, I *still* thought it might have just been an unfortunate accident, with the slay rule stuff being a red herring.",e21a17

f9ej0ev,"I think that's also due to family pressure, particularly from her mother. She was the only one who suggested maybe Marta should keep that inheritance if it's what Grandpa wanted. I'm just guessing that Marta will support her through her education.",e21a17
f9doupq,"We don't actually know from the movie the extent to which she was pressured. After the phone call, we do see the family around her which, given her visible discomfort, would seem to indicate some amount of familial pressure. However, she told her family about Marta's mom completely off screen so we have no idea what that exchange was like.
Given that her family didn't know anything about Marta's situation (in fact Richard explicitly touted her family as an example of people who immigrated ""the right way"") it's difficult for me to imagine that her family could have pressured her into giving up that info. What would that conversation have been like given that they had no idea of her mom's situation? It seems much more likely that Meg volunteered that information on her own, likely due to fears over her education.


However that fear does not excuse her actions at all, in my opinion. Telling her family about Marta's mom's immigration status was an action which, from what she knew at the time and what a reasonable person could infer, would likely result in Marta's family being torn apart. That's not something a friend does, ever.

Fine, she believed that her mom wouldn't be able to pay for her 5th year of college -- then you try to get financial aid from the school or find a way to take on loans or *something*. That doesn't give you the right to destroy a family.

I could see someone in her position rationalizing it by saying that the pressure would result in Marta giving up the money and therefore she wouldn't end up being separated from her family so ""no harm done."" I don't buy that either. Earlier in the movie, she made a crack at her alt-right cousin about ""SWATing undocumented immigrants"". Even if this was hyperbolic, Walt's whole family expressed some very overt anti-immigrant sentiments and the kid was clearly characterized as alt-right, so it seems absolutely in character for the cousin to report Marta after they get the money back (when they have no more use for her). She has to know that in telling her family about Marta's mom, there's a serious risk in Marta losing her family anyway.

It's also really telling that she goes from being offended on Marta's behalf at the very beginning, going so far as to tell her ""you're a part of this family"", but later in the movie finishes with ""but we're his *real* family"". 

I'll grant that she's a bit more sympathetic than the other members (at least on the surface) and that her motivations are a bit more understandable, but I think the movie is pretty overt in its condemnation of her hypocrisy.

First you think wow, Meg is pretty cool. But then I went back and thought... Maybe not.

This is affected by personal experience, I've met people like that before, who acted that way around me. Nice, but clearly still ignorant of their privilege or trying really hard to rationalize keeping it. You're right that she was just trying to protect her education... But so what?

f9suiwi,"Blood: when we saw it through her eyes, she *left before* he cut his throat, down the stairs, came back up, left the mud, etc.
Perhaps I missed when she got the blood on her, but I take it from the comment around blood splatter - it would be messy and suggests she was in the room as he cut his own throat.




Why: throughout the movie, the family members misrememeber where she is from, manipulate her, etc - in some cases, with overt racism (anchor baby!!)

I take the scene where Harlan loses at go and cheats to be an indicator of his true personality: petty and vindictive, he'll play games with you but wants to win, and will cheat you if he doesnt.
He raised this family and is somewhat responsible for the bulk of them having large personal failings.

I suggest Marta's motive would be simply to punish the whole family, from the top down, for the continued subtle racism.

It's interesting that her family is the opposite of Harlan's - no father figure, a mother with no control over her children, etc, etc. 
Though it is not shown, perhaps she has a large and unresolved sense of anger toward her own father - and to see this patriarch do so badly at parenting conflicts with her idealized image of what a father should be. Her revenge on her absent father/causing the death of Harlan blurring into the same symbolic act.


For point three, Harlan showed her their personal failings a few times over. While he did not say he would cut them out of the will, it could be inferred he would do something like that - she regularly beats him at go and has seen how he handles his family.

Point 4 I agree is somewhat weak, but only because of the frequency of vomiting.
It's a ridiculous plot device (I lie, so I vomit) that isn't seen in real life, designed to be a huge and obvious sign to the audience.
I feel it could have been a much better device if we were shown that it was a fabrication, or done less frequently.

https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/11/knives-out-review-rian-johnson/602653/

I mean, it is quiet obvious and not subtle the way Johnson is manipulating the subconscious of Americans with this movie. More amazing is how you don't even realize it!

So I can suspend my disbelief enough to think someone might have the ability to say a couple of cogent words before death an hour or so later.  Maybe Ransom fucked up the injection.  

Last point, he needed to set up the idea that the medical examiner's office was burned down because Marta was hiding the blood and toxicology report.  Murdering the blackmailer (Fran) in such a way as to make it seem like the toxicology report would inducate morphine overdose, thus implicating Marta became his only reasonable play.

E.g. one such film had something like 15 positive reviews on Reddit after showing at a decent sized festival and the likelihood of 15 Redditors being at that festival specifically to watch that movie is just not believable.

f9i0n4o,"> or interesting, and unlike scream, which was still horrific and mysterious despite it's satrizing elements, this movie didn't foster much tension or mystery.

Fair enough. I can't say I agree. I felt he tension in the first half came from Marta scrambling to cover up her involvement as Benoit followed leads and in the second half from questions like who was blackmailing Marta? Who killed the blackmailer? What is the real story behind Harlan's death?

>whether the cops believed suicide or not (it could've come up in early discussions between the cops when they were arguing over murder / nonmuder).

This would have been completely artificial though. There's no reason for cops to talk about a toxicology report when they don't suspect foul play, or specifically poisoning. Perhaps the script could have delayed the coroner's report instead or something but this seems an overly fussy point.

>But he was too in control of every situation after the diner scene, asked leading questions, knew things that shouldn't be immediately memorable too easy

Can you give examples?

>And his choice to give up Ana so readily was the nail in the coffin.

It's not very out of character for a guy who was only helping for a cut of the money to act selfishly, especially when he is already established as a selfish character.

>Ultimately a lot of this boils down to personal opinion. Sure, like any mystery movie, there's lots of little clues together that tie things together. But without a compelling mystery behind them I don't think a rewatch will have me any closer to being impressed. I would not call this script masterful. Competent, absolutely. Good, I can buy. Nothing beyond that.

Like you said it comes down to opinion, but I think Rian Johnson is one of the best writer-director's out there. His visual style is often lauded but I don't think enough attention is paid to how tightly constructed his plots are. There's not a ounce of fat in this script. What's even more impressive, is that it's not even something that he needed to improve, he's been this way from the very beginning of his directing career. His first movie, Brick, was probably the most confident debut's I've seen from any director.",e21a17

The marijuana is offered to her after the murder, while the investigations are ongoing. This may show her character, but I don't think it proves she didn't have one glass of champagne during the party.

The scene where she is in the toilet doesn't start with the water on, instead, you see her run into the toilet, turn the water on, and then throw up. She didn't want anyone to know that she was throwing up, so she did it behind closed doors so nobody can see, and with water on so nobody could hear. Why would she throw up in there, where nobody can see her? Same thing happened after the car chase, she threw up with nobody noticing. And both times if someone did see her, it would have implicated her.

I think that final time with the call was the only one where she could have taken something to make herself throw up. Other times we see her the entire time, and she could not have taken anything. If she didn't have a condition where she throws up when lying, then she must have the ability throw up whenever she wants.",e21a17

Sure, the immigration angle is there, but its mostly used as a plot device for why Marta is avoiding her confession and to show why the family is so entitled and scummy, and those behaviors manifest regardless of any particular right, left leaning, or particularly xenophobic politics.

Marta and Ransom's side quest, Luke-Rey-Kylo, Canto Bight, they all seem pointless to you but they are crucial in revealing character motivation and their psychological and emotional development. Would you say the story in Looper is pointless detours when Joe ended up killing himself anyway as all loopers do? Of course not because all it arrives at that conclusion, why the character does the things he does is completely different from the beginning of the movie, even if it loops around, as we say.

She probably didn't even know if what she did would work, but luckily it did. I think it's reasonable that attacking other ships with lightspeed had never even been considered before. I think the scene with Poe calling Hux showed very well how incredibly cocky he was, even to the detriment of his fellow fighters. He didn't need to reveal himself at all, but he did just to make fun of Hux. As for the bombs, we saw that the entire battle took place very close to a planet, so it's reasonable that there would still be some gravity. Or, if there isn't, maybe the bombs have some sort of propulsion system or something like that. I thought the chase was very good, and it wasn't really slow at all. Every second we saw that the pursuing ships were getting closer and closer to blowing up the cruiser. There isn't even any sense of relative speed in space so there's no way to tell that it's ""slow."" As for the rescue at the casinno, we saw how empathetic and moralistic Rose was, so it totally makes sense that she would prioritize rescuing animals, especially since she identified with being mistreated under and oppressive hierarchy system.

2. Even in the end he had no evidence. He was clearly not the type focused on making an air tight case but enjoyed the pursuit. Even until the confession he admitted he had nothing to prove it just that it all fit the story he had discovered.
3. She did not understand the toxicology report, she assumed based on the similar story she heard and Harlan not being suicidal that it was poison and thought that would be enough. She proclaims when he arrives at the meeting that she was right as if she wasn't positive until that moment.
4. If it destroyed the results then it doesn't really matter if it looks suspicious until he gets caught. He was trying to get the will reversed, and had her confession. Even without needing to prove anything or thinking through the specifics of the plan, delaying and having her confess would have been enough to accomplish that goal.
5. Maybe it had gotten darker or her more tired between seeing them, or maybe she just was assuming who else would climb up the thing after seeing him and wasn't really paying attention, Idk about that part. But Chris Evans being much more athletic and climbing better could definitely explain being more graceful and not breaking it on his way up vs someone clumsy and distributing weight poorly causing damage. or he cracked it on the way and she just stepped on a vulnerable section. Quite plausible.
6. He had already changed the will when he thought he had 10 minutes to live. Slashing his throat wasn't exactly the same as a healthy person doing it, he was dead either way, he didn't give up anything additional in the moment. As was discussed the money would keep her mother presumably safe from deportation so that's not really an issue if there's some scrutiny. 60 million + scrutiny is way better than no scrutiny and no 60 million.
7. The family was already hounding Harlan non stop for things, I don't think he was expecting Ransom to keep it a secret or anything, he just was telling him, as he was telling everyone off that night and that was the main thing he had to jab at Ransom. 
8. He hired the PI at a time when he thought Harlan was poisoned. If that had happened he would have been in the clear. He didn't find out his mistake until she confessed everything to him in the bar. When he hired Blanc he thought he would correctly uncover the poisoning and the will would be reversed.

1) I think that if a guy slits his own throat the morphine would not matter. The thinking is that he's confirming that he wanted to kill himself. I mean think about it, wouldn't it make sense that someone would do two ways to kill themselves? I've heard of people OD'ing on pills and turning on their car in their garage.

2) Hard to defend this one

4) See #1 + like i mentioned i'm not sure how air tight a memory-testimonial vs a lab results one would matter i think this is a non starter since i'm not familiar with case law

5 + 6) i think the theme here is that Harlan really perhaps was not as kind as you might think. Perhaps this was more of a motive of spite rather than compassion (thus he wanted to get a rise out of ransom. He seemed to only be proud of his oldest daughter who was a self starter (kinda))",e21a17

That's the point. She knew the first time. She only second guessed herself when she saw the label.

>Speaking of the vials and ""just knowing"", I've been taking medications that are in vials since I was six months old. I'll forgive the fact that the doses come with plastic caps you have to remove first (so they Hollywooded it up a bit). But, you instantly know if the seal has been punctured before. You can tell even if your eyes are closed (or if you are sensitive enough to have viscosity ESP like Marta). So either she's a super nurse or a dummy nurse when the script needs it.

That is a valid point, but I'll chalk that up to taking artistic liberty with a technical detail that most of the audience wouldn't know. I don't have a lot of experience with injectable drugs, and I didn't even think of that until you said it.

>1970s fridge magnets can't erase video tapes. I severely doubt they made/make novelty fruit rare earth magnets. They could have had Marta do something like tripping on purpose and break it by landing on it (or on a convenient rock). At least it's something physically possible.

fa1ixwf,"> Where in the movie did Marta treat Harlan with kindness?

You're clearly not good at understanding subtext so I'll explain this to you as if you were five. In the movie, all the people seem to think Marta is a nice girl and very good to Harlan. Harlan also has a very jovial attitude towards her (even plays games with her all the time) and was willing to leave her his inheritance. Even with his impending death he was only thinking of saving Marta, while Marta for her part was thinking of her guilt for accidentally killing Harlan. This suggests the two cared for each other very deeply, likely because Marta took good care of Harlan and was nice to him. You're right that we aren't 'shown' much of this, because we only saw one major scene of Marta and Harlan together. But the movie doesn't want to treat its audience like they're idiots and instead assumes that, based on subtext, the audience will understand their relationship.

> Marta caused Harlan's death. 

Because the vials were switched...it's not her fault. She is absolutely blameless. 

> Remove Marta from the equation and Harlan wouldn't be dead. 

This is false, the vials had their contents switched. If Marta wasn't there, whoever injected the medicine into Harlan would have killed him.

> hating on Harlan's family for coming into an extreme amount of wealth 

Nobody is doing this, that's you projecting. They were hating Harlan's family because they're clearly greedy and willing to stab each other in the back (perhaps literally) to remain rich. Quite a different scenario than a poor immigrant family being excited at suddenly having millions. 

> Being found out that you're here illegally isn't something $100 million can't fix.

This is something you would know or understand if you were rich and used to spending money to fix your problems, like Michael Shannon's character was, but if you're a poor immigrant who was always paranoid about being discovered, you wouldn't think like this.",e21a17

Such a great heist film and wonderful performances all around. People claim Channing Tatum cannot act and they haven't seen Logan Lucky. Shame the way Soderbergh tried to change the way movies were financed and advertised didn't really work for it. 

>Soderbergh is said to have relied primarily on foreign presales to finance Logan Lucky — a practice the indie world has relied on for decades, including such hits as Cinema Paradiso (1988) or The King's Speech (2010). He then went about raising $20 million in marketing funds. That's a fraction of what a major Hollywood studio would spend to trumpet a summer release, but Soderbergh contended that Hollywood traditionally spends too much to market movies. He took a targeted approach, waiting until the eleventh hour to unleash most of the television ads and concentrating outdoor billboards in the Midwest and South. He also didn't test the trailers. Soderbergh will use the same approach when releasing his next film, Unsane, which he shot secretly in June using an iPhone.

And then kept talking about it, basically until he died. Along with the fact that the naloxone is very conveniently missing when it’s also been established that Harlan and the rest of the family see Marta as a competent nurse so I didn’t immediately chalk it up to her being stupid. 

Then if you watch the rest of the movie thinking that the vials were switched from the start, you can assume it is most likely someone who isn’t Marta or Harlan. In the first 15 minutes, before even learning how Harlan died, Blanc dismisses all of the family members motives as “weak sauce” except for Ransom.

fjp39gw,"I could write an essay on your first criticism alone.  Luke had a fantastic arc in this film and so did Leia.  Luke began as the consummate bitter old man after facing failure that the man who once saved the galaxy should never have.  He wasn't supposed to fail after the Battle of Endor, but he did and his attitude in TLJ perfectly reflects this.  Luke is an extremely flawed character, as all people are; that touch of realism was welcome.  His greatest flaw is a love of mystique and power; he couldn't put that lust behind him to properly train Ben Solo and he can't put it behind him when Rey comes to him with just as much power and will.  He couldn't put it behind him when he played the hero on Yavin, on Bespin, and even on Tatooine in Jabba's clutches in the original trilogy.

When he caves again to that power lust and trains Rey, he begins to accept himself and what he's done, partially by talking through Ben's story repeatedly to come to terms with it.  When Luke projects his consciousness to Crait, he has meditated in Rey's absence and come to terms with himself.  He flaunts his force abilities against kylo, showing off and enjoying being the hero.  That image of Luke being the glorious and mighty figure against all odds was what reignited the resistance at the end of TLJ, and his life was well spent to create that.

There would be suspicion cast on Marta of course, but there was suspicion cast on her anyway, and this way there would be no actual evidence against her. 

Harlan assumed that there would be no tox report because his cause of death would be considered open and shut.

You raise good points, but to say it is a symbolic killing of her absent father or sees Harlan as petty and worthy of being murdered etc etc just doesn’t feel like the most direct experience of the text. 

For example, regarding the Thrombey patriarchal family and the Carbrera matriarchal family: why is it you think this is something that would make her want to murder a father figure and not cherish one, especially a silly one that jovially fakes an earthquake when losing? He doesn’t fling the board across the room or get surly, he obviously respects and is thankful for her presence in his life. Maybe her environment is why she cares more about people and became a nurse while the Thrombey family was concerned with prestige and power — to the point of hypocrisy.

f97342i,"And here is where movies never fully do their research into the stuff they use.

Morphine is an opioid, a class of pain medications that work by binding to opioid receptors in your body. How an overdose of an opioid like Morphine (or Fentanyl, Dilaudid, heroin) kills you is by inhibiting your respiratory drive- your brain stops telling you to breathe and you die from a lack of oxygen. Anoxic brain injury can definitely happen after about 10 minutes (or less) or having no oxygen, so maybe that’s where they got that number from.

100 mg of morphine is a HUGE dose. I don’t know exactly how long it would take for it to take effect but I’d bet it’s a few minutes from IV injection to apnea (stopping breathing). Naloxone, the antidote that she was looking for, would definitely reverse the effects of a morphine overdose. There’s no “point of no return” for giving it aside from I guess, if the person is already dead. 

As a side note, 100 mg of ketorolac (the other non-opiate drug), which is what she was trying to give, is also a pretty high dose and would likely cause issues like GI ulcers and renal failure pretty quickly if he was getting that regularly.

Source: I’m a doc

Edit: Also, you can most definitely NOT differentiate one clear-appearing liquid from another with your eyeballs, that’s why paying attention when drawing stuff up is crucial, as well as labeling syringes.

Its still subversion as it undermines your expectations.

fac3uha,"I agree with you, but I also think this illustrates why Rian was the wrong choice to direct any Star Wars film that is not explicitly a side story. He just doesn't understand audience expectations, or even how to reward audience members while subverting their expectations. I'm speaking specifically within the context of directing a Star Wars fiml which is part of the central narrative, not all of Rian's films in general. I really enjoyed Knives Out, but I did not enjoy The Last Jedi.",e21a17
f9osfyb,"I can't agree with you either.

First, Rian Johnson's movies aren't character-driven at all, especially Knives Out. It's a whodunnit where the main focus is on the twists and reveals, and characters get pulled along by the story. That's a plot-driven movie. A character-driven movie is something like the Before trilogy or The Lighthouse, some of my favorite movies of all time, where the plot takes a back seat, which a mystery can't do. Mysteries are almost inherently plot-driven. There is no ""brilliance"" there. You're just trying to cover up a bad plot (in TLJ's case) by saying it's character-driven when it's clearly not. And again, my problem isn't with any preconceived notions. It's that the movie presented an interesting concept and idea and ended walking back on. It's less like Looper or R&J and more like Wonder Woman (which sets up the message that there is no grand villain pulling the strings, only for there to be one). 

I think you're completely misunderstanding me. I *like* the detours. The problem is that the detours and the ideas presented in them end up being more interesting than the actual ending. And since those ideas aren't fully explored and end up abandoned by the main plot, it makes the detours feel pointless and like the movie's spinning its wheels to waste time before the conclusion.",e21a17

fh764pe,"This is exactly my gripe as well. It became obvious very early that none of the family save for Ransom did anything, and suddenly you just have this large number of named characters played by big name actors just becoming a weight. None of them are sympathetic enough for me to want them to get their inheritance, but all of them stop getting enough development and plot relevance to me to ever believe that they're going to get the inheritance. I'm not *afraid* that any of these strangers I barely even know or like are going to emerge victorious, and when Ransom enters the picture, you might as well just toss that set of characters in the garbage anyway, as Ransom takes over the role of 'family who wants to get their daddy's money'. But I guess the entire family standing beneath Marta, with her in her homey throw blanket and the 'my house my rules my coffee' mug was a scene that the director had really insisted on from the start, and it wouldn't have really packed as much a 'satisfying' punch if it was just Ransom. So whatever.

Some 30 minutes in the movie just started like feeling an ending that's just stretching out, a slow and painstaking march towards a very obvious outcome.",e21a17
f94pgg5,"It could be that there *was* a sequence where Benoit offered up his arm as a test, that was originally part of the scene, but got cut for time.

Additionally story wise Rian killed off Snoke without any sort of reveal of his motives, omitted the involvement of The Knights of Ren, a group heavily insinuated to be a major force in the first order, and forced a boring romantic plot on the audience completely contrary to what appeared to be ray and finn falling in together.

Time and distance are problems in that they are traveled too quickly (like the beam from that planet weapon in the force awakens, that could be seen from other planets but blew up a planet far away that could be seen almost immediately on other planets without any lightspeed considerations), or unbelievably slowly (why not just hyperspace microjump ahead of the rebel ships and then) - either way, they are very contrived situations that claim to support the narrative but only do it a disservice. And good for Rose, but that whole scene was unnecessary to show such things, and the programmer guy was totally unneeded in the end anyway. Finn's line itself was cheesy, and that's ok too, but the fact that they then killed Phasma was as stupid as killing off Holdo.

I’m a first generation immigrant and there are plenty of people in my family that think exactly like the rich people in this movie. It’s not as black and white as the movie wants to depict it. Shitty people are just shitty people.

Same with her hippie mother. She's not so subtlety shown to be living off a metaphorical welfare, spouting generic ideas she takes from social media to try and prop herself up as an intellectual. And of course she also doesn't know Marta's heritage and likely didn't want her at the funeral.

Truth is that the white liberal side gets criticized just as much as the alt-right side. Maybe moreso actually. Rian Johnson didn't include the boy as a ""petty hot take"" on the assholes that ran actresses off twitter. He included that kid cause... That's what exists. Same as the Meg type.",e21a17

None of them are perfect in their actions, but they all have redeeming qualities that generally outweigh the bad. 

I think, as you said, Meg is caught in an impossible situation and does what pretty much any of us would do if our entire family were pushing us in a certain direction. Marta immediately reconciles the relationship once they are in contact again and does not hold a grudge whereas she makes no similar effort with anyone else in the family.

Like until he shows up at the end, nothing has been done to show that Luke's characters has changed from the start of the movie to that point. Luke is never shown having a lust for power, he pretty clearly wanted to follow his ideals and fight the Empire. He even gives up his force training to go save his friends and confront Vader on Bespin.

On top of that, Luke's 180 shift in character prior to the events of the movie is never explained well. In the OT he was idealistic and optimistic - he believed that Darth Vader, one of the most evil men in the galaxy, could be redeemed when no one else did. Then he decides that Ben is somehow too evil to save and *must* be killed. What had Ben done before that that proved he was evil? Nothing that is told/shown to the viewer, yet Luke is afraid of the ""darkness"" inside of him. This isn't Luke's character, this is a fearful coward not the idealistic hero of the OT. After realizing Luke wants to kill him, Ben does the sensible thing and destroys the academy and kills the Jedi who are loyal to Luke - the man who just tried to *murder him in his sleep*.

The more likely answer is that they do, and then determine that the kinds of things you’re talking about are not all that important, or rather: when reality is pitted against a movie’s *unreality*, logical reality always yields. They’ve crafted a specific scenario that requires certain specific circumstantial conditions to propel the narrative forward as intended, so they fudge the reality to fit their narrative (which, like all cinema, is an inherent abstraction, because movies are fundamentally emotional experiences, not thought experiments). Is there such thing as a “point of no return” for the scenario on screen? In reality, no, as you’ve described. But that doesn’t matter, because for the purposes of this narrative, *there is.* That stuff is malleable and in service of the larger dramatic needs of the movie. 

As a side note, in reference to your last point: I have multiple bottles of morphine just sitting collecting dust in the back of my cabinet as I type this, from when my grandfather was living with me before he passed a few years ago.

Which is... not good? De/reconstruct doesn't mean 'spin your wheels and end up in the same place.' Empire *does* change the status quo. One of the main heroes in dire peril, the other gets laughably defeated and maimed by the villain and learns a shocking revelation. The ending feels uncertain.  In 8, Rey continues her non-arc of never failing, the villain gets laughably murdered, and the revelation is that there's no revelation. The only status quo change is 'the Resistance is in trouble, no for real this time' that doesn't land because SW in general and the new movies especially are so hand-wavy about scale. So it feels 'things are bad because we told you they're bad but Rey is here to save us guys.'

I agree the Rey/Kylo stuff is interesting (and the most redeeming quality of the new franchise), but it's will-they, won't-they. If the two of them *had* 'turned' together and stood over Snoke's smoldering corpse ready to rule, that would have been scary and an Empire-worthy twist. I'll grant Poe learns a lesson, but Finn's arc seems repeated (in 7 he's running from the Order, in 8 he's running from the Resistance).

Despite her relative financial independence though, she screams in the face of the lawyer just as much as anybody and yells angrily about how they're the goddamn Trombleys. I do wonder why she was so animated despite not needing the estate as much as the rest of them.

At the end, there's an odd moment of calm though, where she gets her father's letter and ""plays his game"" to receive a final gift from him, the truth about her jackass husband.

The neutral accent then seems to play well with the joke about nobody knowing where they're from -- a happy accident.

As for Knives Out, I don't think any of the ""twists"" are surprising, pretty much guessed most of them. However, I was VERY interested in watching Marta's personal journey. She was supposedly an honest, kind, hardworking person. But she was also willing to go through great lengths to lie for her own sake. How far will she go to cover her own ass? That is what I was interested in finding out. She could've left Fran for dead, but when she started doing CPR and called the cops, I was genuinely moved. Had she done the RIGHT thing the first time, stood unwavering instead of letting Harlan talk her into the lie, Harlan wouldve been alive. This made her choice at the end VERY impactful. Rian's plots are driven by character MOTIVATION. They move the plot through their inner doubts, fears and the overcoming of that fear, and the plot serves that inner journey. We see this again and again in TLJ, in Knives Out, and in Looper. I've read many classic whodunnit detective novels, took a whole course in university. You almost NEVER see this kind of character development in those stories. Not in Agatha Christie, not in Sherlock Holmes, not in Edgar Allen Poe's original detective stories, etc etc.Also I must point out, your claim that mysteries must be plot driven us unfounded.

I would also say the political over tones were obvious, but given how nicely they were woven with the character motivations, they seemed *inevitable*. Politics are, after all, just personal motivations on a grand scale, so why is it heavy-handed when the characters in a contemporary film reflect contemporary concerns?

In any case; the political message I saw was more of a class message than anything else. A primary concern of most people is portraying themselves well as the heroes of their own story, and therefore privileged people tend to try to see themselves as deserving of their privilege, and conversely try to see others as *not* deserving of that privilege.

For the rich family, this takes the form of being benevolent, but when somebody who they are benevolent toward becomes independent of that benevolence, and indeed leapfrogs them, we see that “benevolence” for what it really was. That this evokes a *political* question (“should families be torn apart for having the audacity to walk across an imaginary line?”) is only because it has a lot to do with a question that many people are asking themselves (“Am I a better/more worthy person than those who were born in between different imaginary lines?”). And fundamentally, the political question of the day is the same as the personal question “who do we assume is an equal with agency, and who do we assume is only here because we allow them to be?”

And these questions were never really ones of “immigration.” A few weeks ago I came across a guy with an Australian accent open carrying a .45 on a belt while wearing a t-shirt and board shorts, sporting a red “Keep America Great” hat. Do you think, being an immigrant himself, he was concerned about Trump’s rhetoric on immigration? I would say no, because he knows damn well it had less to do with immigration than general “othering,” and he wasn’t going to be othered.

In the movie, this coexists with the Blanc character himself. Marta and Blanc are, on the surface, extremely different people, but the way they are both treated as “outsiders” unites them. With the Blanc character there, who would be a better class-based avatar to use as a protagonist.",e21a17
f9272wh,"If you really couldn't see how all of Harlan's children were fundamentally assholes, wealthy or not, you need to have your head examined or we were watching a very different film.

Want to clarify some things:

Its heavily implied that Harlan is giving Marta the money because he trusts her to oversee his family's affairs. Not necessarily because he doesn't think she'll give them a single cent of his fortune.

She's only covering her tracks so her family doesn't get found out for being illegal immigrants. Not necessarily because she doesn't want to confess from the get go. When she gets the inheritance, she's clearly mostly afraid about what it means for her family and is only regretful to renounce it because its what Harlan wanted. Painting her motives for keeping the inheritance as questionable here is super misplaced.

Lastly, all art is political in the sense that its going to be someone else's perspective on a host of things you encounter in every day life.

>Rian’s script was bulletproof to begin with. Obviously the ad-libs came in the times when we would all be together, like when we’re chasing [Marta] out of the house. I think I got a couple of good ad-libs in that scene. There was a nice little piece where we’re talking about Trump, and Marta coming into the country the right way [as opposed to undocumented immigrants, according to Richard]. Meanwhile, subconsciously, I’m just handing her my empty plate. That was an ad-lib.

That and the fact that saying Marta was a part of the family had limits, as seen when she said that Harlan's fortune should go to his ""actual family"".

Hard disagree on this. Meg was the only one who knew Marta's mom was undocumented. So in reality, Meg's family didn't push her to do anything; they have no idea that Meg is sitting on such a big secret. Meg would only reveal that information because it could be used as blackmail to get her tuition money back.

fjysyig,"I believe you forgot that Luke is not a onedimensional character.  I noted he has a hunger for both power and heroism, and though neither were as strong as in his father Anakin, this simply resulted in Luke having less of a moral crisis than Anakin did as they aged.  In the originals he is highly idealistic, yes, but intense ideals in youth tend to subside in adults.  This allowed a much more human version of Luke to come forward in TLJ, a version who, after years of peace and security and light, had feared that the paradise his younger self had helped to shape would collapse in the face of Kylo's corruption.  This slavery to fear that caused a moral meltdown is not baseless, and even then it could still rest firmly on Luke's age.  This is his midlife crisis, attempting to save a rather egoistic operation (the new Jedi order) from something he thought he created.  Such crises happen, especially to Jedi who weren't trained until age 18 like Luke.  Instead of solving the problem of Ben Solo, Luke retreats into his fear once again and it is only Rey's young idealism that both improves herself and awakens Luke.  You are correct that his character remains static for much of TLJ, but again, this can be attributed to middle age.

faxw8tx,"I still don't think it makes sense for several reasons.

1. No-one knew that Harlan had been possibly killed by an overdose for the simple reason that the toxicology results (ignoring for a second here that they would have come clean) had been burned and Ransom had already burnt the hospital . So even if they found Fran's body and find out she had died of an overdose I don't think they could have possibly linked Martha to her. 
2. I agree hiding the body would have been difficult but even for a second if we believe that Ransom planned on implicating Martha with her murder the logistics require a big leap of faith and honestly kinda felt inconsistent with the rest of his brilliant plan. 
3. What saved Martha was that the detective couldn't understand who had hired him because that someone was obviously privvy to something big and their motivations were at the centre of the whole movie. That fact, in addition to an anonymous call placing Martha with Fran's dead body that couldn't have framed her and probably outed him. Hence why I think that whole scheme doesn't make sense.

I am willing to concede that maybe he did want to frame Martha but I still think that poetic angle is a bit of a loop-hole. Enjoyed the movie though.",e21a17
f95oupf,"Previously unfamiliar with Rian Johnson. I have seen Looper and realizing both films are by the same person is sort of enlightening. I enjoyed Looper a lot during my first (and only) viewing of it. By the end I had the same ""huh?"" ""what?"" ""that doesn't make sense"" going on but I ignored it because logical inconsistencies and time travel stories go hand in hand. Ignoring the logic made the film rather enjoyable and fun. However, I was vaguely (and rather detrimentally) underwhelmed by the ""reveal""/conclusion of the film which is why I have not rewatched it. It felt like a lot of song and dance for nothing. Mind you I enjoyed the song and dance mainly until the end left me with nothing - which is a greater disappointment than a film that is just lackluster throughout.

I probably would have had much different expectations if I knew this film was by the same person who did Looper. A lot of song and dance, persistent logical inconsistencies, underwhelming ending.

It's heavy-handed because of the way that concern was delivered. There was no subtlety in it. I don't necessarily have a problem with the message, I just have a problem with how often we were beaten over the head with it.

As far as why the family turned on her, that did not happen simply because she gained independence, they turned on her because she took what they believed was promised to them. I don't know about you, but I'd be pissed too if my father gave away millions to someone that was not family, and left me high and dry.

I understand this film is trying to ask bigger questions of its audience, but the problem is that it then answeres those very questions for us. Marta is judged worthy of the old man's inheritance, and the others are not. I don't see why that is. From my point of view, she was no better than the rest of them.

I actually agree with your last point. Most people don't treat others badly because they are immigrants, they treat them bad because they see them as outsiders. But everyone has the capacity to do that, not just the rich. The movie for me failed to depict that.

So these changes to his character between the end of the OT and this movie are things you are assuming. These are pieces of the story that you are writing yourself, not information given to us by the movie. That’s my point. The movie does a very unconvincing job of explaining why Luke’s attitude flipped 180 and plenty of people are offering valid explanations, but the viewers shouldn’t be filling in a gap that significant to the story. 

Luke is never shown wrestling with his ideas in this movie until the one scene where Yoda shows up and then suddenly he’s not a coward anymore. There’s no interaction with him and Rey that makes you believe he is inspired by her tenacity or heroism. I’m not saying that isn’t the case, but it’s not made clear through the writing of the movie.

I know what intravenously means\^\^ and I'm the one who abbreviated it. Your short term memory makes me think you may be a lost cause. Technically the peripheral catheter is intravenous because its administered in to a vein. They're the same. So my point was that he takes injections daily which makes me believe they would not be 'venous.' He already had his sleeves rolled up and there was no permanent catheter. So by your logic he takes daily venous injections with new sticks. This could destroy your veins and would leave heavy scarring (neither things i noticed). Turns out daily morphine would actually be more likely taken by mouth so there are other faults in the movie. But these are things you'd either be a nurse to be sure about or google it. Hence you can accept it happened a way that works or search for a way that doesn't.

Not a doctor or a nurse, but that sounds perfectly reasonable to me.

He has formulated his plan and cut her off from calling 911 within four minutes of the shot:  ""Listen. If what you said is true I am gone, there's no saving me, we have six minutes. There is one last thing I need to do in this world, and only you can help me do it. But you need to trust me and do everything I say....""

At this point, he's acting a bit weird -- maybe sweating and maybe talking a bit slower, and she's been hysterical nearly the whole time. His behavior being perfectly explainable from stress and power of suggestion/placebo effect.

It's entirely plausible that she thinks she's seeing the beginnings of symptoms in him, and really isn't thinking clearly due to the stress. And it's not like they're there staring at a clock. So yes, you can pick and niggle a bit at the timeline, but it's easily within the realm of possibility for her to be a decent nurse but still think he's going to die.

Then, during the funeral, he switches them back so when they test her kit, it won't show up.  

Then, Fran's cousin, who works at the toxicology lab, takes the bag and gives it to Fran so she can blackmail Ransom.  

She only suspects Ransom of having to do with the murder which is why she yells ""I knew it!"" when she sees him come in. 

He then chloroforms Fran, and injects her with the morphine bottle which we see on the ground.

So he did not dose her with the analgesic. He injected morphine into her neck.  

The movie stated previously that after 10 minutes, you're beyond the point of no return for a morphine overdose (real life, you have 2 minutes then you die). Somehow, she lives for 2 hours overdosed, until Marta saves her, then she dies later in the hospital.

fjz79wn," It you speak on Luke’s heroism in the context of his lust for power and mystique. Those characteristics are not why Luke is a hero or what causes him to behave how he does. It’s pretty well established that he does not want to kill Vader and he believes in redeeming him. That is not debatable, it’s expressed in various ways across the last two movies of that trilogy. 

So again, I’m not mad that Rian wanted to do something different with Luke Skywalker.

Maybe it’s because he’s aged and grown weary, but this is a movie so there’s no reason to not explain that in some manner. You or I should not have to be filling in the gaps when Luke’s shift in character is such a huge part of that movie.",e21a17

fa4soyu,"Non of that stuff dabbles much in sci-fi though. The Old Republic is just an adventure story that uses space as a setting. ""Sci-fi"" rarely drives the plot, it's always about mysticism and religion (Jedi), bloodlines or good vs. evil.",e21a17
fa3eoq4,"The scale of a kamikazi pilot vs a destroyer isn't the same as a single hyperdrive ship vs the Death Star.  If a kamikazi pilot could take out an entire fleet on its own, it would absolutely be done (if we still had wars like that.)

Plus you don't even need to sacrifice anyone's life (although some evil person wouldn't have a problem with that.)  You just have a droid captaining the ship.  

It's like giving a super weapon to half the universe.  In the context of that single movie, it was a smart move for the characters.  But I agree with the other poster that the implication of it wrecks a lot of the other stories.",e21a17
f8unohn,"Sure. The problem probably isn't the revenue, it's the data involved. If AMC/Regal/Cinemark would agree to allowing RT to have ticket sales numbers, that is a hugely valuable type/amount of data for Fandango/Warner to have relatively easily and costing them next to nothing in acquiring the data. I just can't see the theater companies going along with it as it could be used as leverage against them in some negotiations.",e21a17
f9s4a2y,It can. But will it?  I donno.,e21a17
f9vm0f1,"How is that thematized in the movie? You could literally say that about any film with narration that is misleading, but it definitely wasn't the main theme of this particularly film.",e21a17
fhxxe9y,"There’s clearly more than a lot of films but plot point set pieces are not needed for a plot. 

I’m using the definition of plot. The Before Trilogy also has a plot, in a very much classical three act structure. It’s people literally meeting and talking until the end of the movie and very much still a plot.",e21a17
f9atxzf,"At the very least, the police would want to formally question Marta. As the last person to have a meaningful interaction with him she would have been a person of interest from the beginning. And if he had a lethal dose of morphine in him that would instantly turn the situation into a cover-up.",e21a17
f95s2jq,She has to confess because she’ll vomit when they ask her specific questions after seeing the toxicology report.,e21a17
f9474z9,I absolutely love his lightsaber. The sparking effect they give it makes it look so menacing and dangerous compared to most of the ones we've seen. And I totally agree about Adam Driver. His acting is amazing.,e21a17
f9llcw9,That isn’t how a real investigation would be sealed off and there would be someone there to make sure he didn’t sneak up to tamper with evidence. That was just a narrative contrivance,e21a17
f9lbgkq,Oh yeah? What'd you pirate the movie or drive back in and rewatch it today because of a reddit discussion? Lol if you were Marta you'd be standing in a pile of vomit.,e21a17
fefomrb,fuck this is a good drama,e21a17
fdixvwv,"...yes he was, as part of the mystery as to what was going on with the movie. The big mystery of the movie wasn't ""who hired the detective?!"".",e21a17

f9scwa5,Lol. OK,e21a17
f9r7cr8,Ransom would have switched the labels back by then and she’d be squarely responsible.,e21a17
f9qft77,"how do you know she isn't in trouble, the movie ended just as the truth came out. this another assumption that you make that wasn't explicitly shown.

additionally, ransom admitted to tampering with the drugs, including stealing away the naloxone, the toxicology report shows that she didn't inject harlan with the incorrect drugs, Blanc himself says that she did nothing wrong because if Harlan took her advice of going to the hospital he would be fine (an argument her fancy lawyers can use if it goes to court)

and you really said that you understood the movie perfectly fine and cant remember any of these details...",e21a17
f9qj68y,"She didn’t poison him, why would she be in trouble?",e21a17
f8w4i4n,Thats because his character is an asshole racist. Its not the thesis of the entire movie,e21a17
