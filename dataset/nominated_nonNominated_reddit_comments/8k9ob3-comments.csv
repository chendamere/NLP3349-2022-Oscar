Cable was badass, the references were a hundred fold, the X-Force almost immediately dying horrible deaths was hilarious, Juggernaut was awesome, the X-Men cameo was hilariously unexpected, just.. everything was fantastic in my eyes.

Edit: that end credits scene too. That had me rollin’.

The trailer focused on the X-Force team which made their sudden deaths hilarious. We had no idea Juggernaut was in this.

Had a blast with this movie. Think I liked it just a bit more than the first.

Edit: Thought it might be fun to share this. Before I saw the movie I remembered hearing there was no scene at the very end of the credits but decided to stay until the end just in case. Turns out just about everyone else in the packed theater did too. Meanwhile right when the credits started this guy who worked for the theater was coming in to collect garbage and stood at the side of the auditorium near the exit. Right when it ended and me and my buddy realized we watched the entire credits for nothing, I got up and headed for the exit (we were pretty well the first ones out because of where we were sitting) and before we left I asked the dude if he knew that we were all waiting around for nothing and just didn't speak up and he started laughing and was like ""Yeah, and I'm gonna do this every time!""",8k9ob3

X-Men cameo was great!

I didn’t feel like Vanessa had a big enough part in this movie, but hopefully the credits scenes mean we’ll see more of her!

2 moments that really wowed me.   
1. Deadpool's arm is broken and he uses that to his advantage to choke his enemy.   
2. Deadpool drives his sword through the dash of a car to press the accelerator of it.

There is one other moment I can vaguely recall where 2 characters are moving around each other to dispatch bad guys.

Those are just 2 moments in a film filled with superbly choreographed action.  Action was spot on in D2.

dzredqp,"I think the X-force dropping in is my favorite scene of the movie. It lampoons all the ""superheroes team up for the good of the planet or whatever"" trope and then immediately kills most of them off to keep the story pared down. 

Also, Cable was pretty good. ",8k9ob3
dz5ytp4,dubstep's for pussies.,8k9ob3
dz5ysa6,"Jesus. I loved it. Saw a lot of interviews where the cast referred to the movie as ""bold"" and I'd say that covered it. 

Like any movie, it isn't perfect and there are definitely some bones to pick. But I think that it was really good as a whole.

I fucking loved Domino in this movie. I know there was some questions when Zazie Beetz was cast, but she fucking nailed it. I really liked the care-free attitude that came along with her life of good luck. She's a lot less serious than her comic counterpart, but still just as skilled. I think this iteration of Domino works perfectly with Ryan's Deadpool and I can't wait to see more of her. 

Josh killed it as Cable. He can really nail that gruff, gravely voice. The CGI around his arm was *suuuuuuuper* well done, and I can't believe I got to see fucking Cable on the big screen. Childhood me just had his mind blown. I really like how he was kind of stranded in our timeline, but the extra credits scene might have something to say about that. Again, I can't wait to see more Cable in future movies. 

The humor in this movie was pretty on point. They might have had one or two too many self-referential jokes, but it wasn't too bad. Julian Dennison was phenomenal as Russel. Him and Wade went really well together, and he had a couple one-liners that were really memorable. ""Damn it feels good to be a gangsta!'

I can't believe they killed off the entire squad! That kind of blew my mind. I figured Peter would die, but I thought Bedlam and Shatterstar might be around for the long haul. I would have loved to see more Terry, but it was worth it to have that unexpected moment where I'm sitting there in shock. ""Did they really just kill half the squad?"" I can see this being a contentious thing to do, but I was really into it. I did not see it coming, and only in a Deadpool movie could they build up this hero squad and then kill half of them because of high winds. 

And HOLY SHIT COLOSSUS SAID FUCK. That was so fucking hilarious. Hit fight with The Juggernaut was *everything* I wanted it to be. To see those two really going at each other was fucking **intense.** I like that he was dented in the head at the end, just walking around like that. What a trip.

I feel like I want to hop into a full rundown of the movie from beginning to end, talking about all the highlights. I really loved this movie. 

I can't wait for future X-Force movies. I like that they might be willing to do some dirty work, but still bring some heroism and levity to the situation. I hope Colossus becomes a staple of the movie version of X-Force. Yukio and Negasonic as well. The lineup of them all at the end when Wade is coming back to life is a **solid** squad to build X-Force around, and maybe add 1 or 2 more ""big-league"" players. 

I have so much more I want to say. I just want to gush about this movie. Probably going to go back and see it again this weekend. ",8k9ob3

Story was surprisingly good, too. I liked the first Deadpool plenty, but it was really just a showcase for the character; plot wasn't all that much, you were there for Wade and if he wasn't your cup of tea there was no reason to watch the movie.

This movie has a story that could actually work even if played completely straight. Telling it with Deadpool is like dipping fries in your frosty, it doesn't sound like it'll work but the results are surprising.

He pokes his head out to see some purple guy beating the shit out of some budget avengers impersonators because obviously it would be too difficult or expensive to get everyone. Maybe he recognizes Thanos as cable and thinks it's some alternate timeline and ends up killing him saving everyone after a bit of exposition proving he was evil in this world, or he could kill him just to say they're even. Avengers are all confused afterwards and then he tries the watch again but it still doesn't work, he'll use some distinct profanity that would make them all recoil and gasp since their movie is pg-13. Or maybe he tries to but it's bleeped out so then he swears even more getting bleeped trying to get the hell out of this censored timeline.

dzbe269,"Watching Deadpool's X Force: First Class going down in flames within a few minutes of their first mission felt like Reynolds' response to the studio and the first director wanting a bigger Deadpool sequel. Reynolds has always said that he wants to keep Deadpool small. (I think the thought behind that is the smaller the picture, the lesser the risk on the studio, the more freedom he gets to do the movie he wants to do.) Having the X Force running around blowing up a city and such would have killed that desire. The studio would have tabled up to the kitchen like so many cooks, potentially spoiling the broth. So, Reynolds and the writers killed off the X Force. Technically, he did have them in his movie. The studio can't say he failed to deliver on that. Even had a major A-list star playing one of them (for a split second). But within a few minutes Reynolds got rid of them and went back to the smaller storyline that he clearly wanted more. 

Honestly, I am with Reynolds with this. Deadpool works best on a smaller scale where they can focus on character and especially dialog. It's Deadpool. He's the Merc with the Mouth. To have more scenes where stuff is exploding and a cast of a thousand is running  about with little dialog than to having quieter scenes where Deadpool is sitting on the couch, growing back his legs and just running his mouth would be boring for Deadpool.

Even tho it wasn't explained, they still followed the rules of his techno organic virus without interjecting an out of place origin scene.

The X-Force stuff was hilarious including the introduction of Domino and how they showed her power on screen. Liked the reveal and how they handled Juggernaut.  
  
The stuff with Russell was a bit convoluted, I kept wondering why Wade or Cable didn't just put two in that pedophile headmaster head for what he did to those kids especially since they have no problems killing other scumbags. Dopinder scenes/jokes just wasn't hitting. I wish there was more Cable and Deadpool scenes but that will probably happen in the future movies.

The crowd literally gasped when the bookshelf crushed that dude's head. And you can hear some people feel genuinely bad when the skydiving scene was going on. Good shit. 

I also felt genuinely sad at times. So it's really impressive how Deadpool has done superhero movies so well. Also it has the advantage of being a movie that subverts the typical superhero tropes. While also highlighting them with a character like Cable. 

Btw, Cable and Domino were fantastic. I enjoyed seeing them as much as I enjoyed seeing Deadpool on screen. I'm just happy we finally get all these people properly showcased on the silver screen. 

They humanized Deadpool so well! The collar was a great plot device. You never felt he was going to die in the first movie but they made him a lot more mortal here.

The unexpectedly emotional scenes in the movie and the incredible amount of gay flirting going on all over the place, it was wonderful and beautiful and just as fun and funnier than the first film and I'm already planning to spend my holidays reading the entire comics. I've already watched every interview I could get my hands on of the cast on YouTube. All that's left is to wait for the bluray, buy it. Watch the gag reel. Replay my favourite moments, show it to people who didn't watch it yet (which sadly hurts my heart but there are many folks I know who isn't into it) 

It's already been 3 weeks, nearly a month since I've watched it twice. ...I might watch it again once I find the nerve in me to go alone to a crowded cinema in the CBD in the middle of the night as celebration for... For being alive. Yay!

Secondly the new cast members fit in really well, especially Cable and Domino who I'm really looking forward to seeing more of.

I also loved how often the movie subverted my expectations. I was so shocked when Vanessa died, my heart broke for Wade. Then the opening credits started and I couldn't stop laughing, it was very cleverly done. And similiarly how the X Force were introduced and it looked like they'd be a team for the rest of the movie, only for all but one of them to be killed in the next scene! I am glad that Deadpool managed to go back in time and save Vanessa and Peter at the end though, not sure if he saved the rest of the team but I hope he did.

Finally the cameos were awesome, the X\-Men closing the door on Deadpool at the mansion, Brad Pitt as the vanisher, Alan Tudyk, and of course Wolverine himself in the end credits. I know it was achive footage but I gasped nonetheless. And the icing on the cake was Deadpool shooting Ryan Reynolds as he reads the Green Lantern script. I knew that had to be what he was reading before the title was revealed but that didn't make it any less hilarious.

Overall I'd give this a 9/10 and will most likely catch it again at the cinema soon as I'm sure I missed a lot of jokes because I was laughing so much!",8k9ob3

Yukio was the cutest, looking forward to more Yukio, Domino and Cable-I’m not familiar with their backgrounds but I hope all three of them are in the third movie. 

My only small complaint was not enough Negasonic Teenaged Warhead or Yukio. 

I also loved the Jared Kushner and Fox N Friends jokes. I always love a good Kushner or Paul Ryan joke. 

The Cab Driver’s “What the fuck” freak out after Peter was accepted into the X force was hilarious.

dzbxss5,"Very fun movie much like the first one. This one has a better story though I think the first one is funnier. The sequel does seem to have more pop culture references so some people may be lost. It's strange how the Deadpool movie treat their X-Men characters better than the mainline films like Colossus and Juggernaut. Unfortunately Black Tom is killed so we won't get our Juggernaut Bitch reference of Black Tom getting his pimp cane and teaming up with Juggernaut (who survived at the end with getting out of the pool). 

Something not many people mention was the choreography of the fight scenes and how well shot it was so that you can discern the action clearly(no surprise given that a John Wicker director is behind this film). Deadpool and Cable skillfully often redirect their opponents to kill each other in various cool techniques. 

Also noticed that with Deadpool's death scene that the music sounded suspiciously like the one used in Logan. I looked up on IMDB and confirmed that it was. 

By the way when Deadpool breaks the fourth wall, can the other characters hear him? Like when he speaks directly to us or calls Cable ""Thanos"", does Cable wonder what the hell he's talking about? ",8k9ob3

Not sure how many people in my theater got the Take on Me reference with the whole crossing over thing(I thought even if some people didn't know the original video they might recognize it from Family Guy), though to be honest, before the singing started I thought it was going to be 99Red Balloons. 

Really enjoyed Domino(obligatory [coheed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fss62DCM18w) reference). Thought the Hawkeye line was great, along with Black Black Widow.

Thought the jab at DC and Cable being dark was better in the trailer, whatever he said to get DP to say that just fell flat for me.

It was a pretty big deal when jt came out, and it was he director’s first film after lagaan, which some of you may remember as the media darling for best international film at the oscars in 2000 or 2001, even tho it didnt win. The song being olayed is the first song in the film, and it basically depicts the main character Mohan driving an old, sage-like hitchhiker who is going to a place that is on the way to Mohan’s old village. The lyrics basically tell of the challenges and opportunities faced by wandering travellers, and “yuhi challah” basically means “go forth, traveller” (if my
Himdi is correct). It’s kind of a road trip song tjats picturized is a comical yet philosophical way in the film. It was a totally random easter egg that caught me off guard, and I thought it was really funny that Brolin sId to turn it off. Inwas half expecting DP to give a full breakdown of the film to be full on meta. But it was a sort of fittig song to wha was going on in the film, so it has some
Meaning nonetheless. I honestly feel like Dopinder’s actor had some say in song selection during that scene, because its just *such* a random bollywood song to choose in that moment

e38nbmm,"Coming back to this a month or so later I realized I was kind of hard of this film. My biggest complaint before was that the plot was too sentimental for a Deadpool movie, but honestly the first film was kind of like that too. Just instead of Wade pining for Vanessa he tried to save Russell, neither of which are exactly comic accurate but that's clearly the tone this trilogy was going on for and I think it was honestly a mistake on my end for assuming this would be radically different. 

If anything, I actually think this movie did a lot *more* than the first film to embrace Deadpool's comic roots. Like the X-Force arc in the middle of the movie was genius with all of them getting recruited and then dying like that. Total Deadpoolesque wackiness, and I'm not going to lie the scene with the rednecks with Matt Damon's cameo was seriously amazing. 

Overall, I still think there are a few problems with this movie. But all things considered I don't think it was that bad of a movie and I'm strangely looking forward to future Deadpool movies where they might go full on Comic Book, since it seems like Tim Miller (a man who I have great respect for mind you) is the one who was really pushing for the sentimental stories.

Josh Brolin was incredible as Cable, seeing him kill all the pedophiles alongside Deadpool was one of my favorite action sequences in the whole film.

I loved that mid-credits scene, as soon as I saw Ryan Reynolds with that script I was praying for a Green Lantern roast.

A little disappointed by the Stan Lee cameo, seeing as it was just his image, not his actual physical appearance. The one in the first movie was much better.

I’m so happy there was a fucking Les Miserables reference!!!! The prisoner at the top of the planning map, who looks suspiciously like Wolverine, is labeled as “Prisoner #24601” Jean Valjean, who Hugh Jackman also played.

One more thing, shoutout to that very subtle Taylor Swift reference. It makes total sense because Reynolds’ kid is the child who says “Gorgeous” in the beginning of the song of the same name off Taylor’s new album.

I will say, for a film directed by a stunt director some of the fight scenes are edited sloppily. And that *one* CGI heavy scene is obnoxious it kinda takes you out.

dzb59js,"I'm surprised at how few people are discussing Wade's arc from the first film through this installment, because it's pretty good when viewed as one arc.

The earliest point we see in Wade's life is him standing up for a kid, then leaving and denying himself the ""hero"" title.  He establishes precisely 3 relationships and alienates everyone else.  Even in the climax of Deadpool 1, he chooses *not* to be what he thinks of as a ""hero"" by killing Ajax.  **He was static.**  He didn't learn anything at all, except that Vanessa didn't care about his looks and Colossus' crotch is a hard target.

But Deadpool 2 starts Wade down the path to a more nuanced and freeing definition of heroism, an arc that Joe Kelly, Fabian Nicieza, and Rick Remender all did very well in the comics. Deadpool is forced to get over his self-loathing and see that people love him and need him. Whether he stays or goes *matters.*  His face, his past, his not living up to Colossus' bullshit definition of heroism... Those didn't matter.  He finally chose to *be there* for somebody, and it made a literal world of difference.  

Tracking that character arc from the first film through the second gives me a lot of respect for Reese, Wernick, & Reynolds.",8k9ob3
dzbdfps,"One thing I don't think is getting enough praise is how heavy, meaty, and fucking brutal the fight scenes are in these films. Compared to the MCU (which I do love) where a lot of impacts don't have a lot of *oomph*, especially from characters like Hulk or Thor, and instead are somewhat bouncy and spongy with comparatively ""soft impacts,"" I really enjoyed how bone-crushingly violent and heavy the action was here. Juggernaut vs Colossus in particular felt weighty and powerful in a way I wish the MCU would capture. Great action in this film all-around and Domino was an incredible new addition.",8k9ob3
dzcoisa,"I loved it.  I think more than the first, but I'll wait to call that after I see it again.

I feel this one did a better job showing Deadpool's humanity.  People forget (or don't know) that Deadpool absolutely can play up the gravitas.  Some of his best moments in the comics are with that.

Back in his first limited series, when he first reveals his face to Siryn, it's a bit narmy but still solid.  His stint with the ""grey-and-black"" X-Force had some great moments, most notably probably being the ""baby bird"" scene.  The entirety of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.  His interactions with his daughter.

Cable was great.  Domino was awesome, and the way they showed her powers just worked.  The Juggernaut surprise was amazing (if blatantly telegraphed).  The bait-and-switch with X-Force was totally out of left field.",8k9ob3

dz6j9h0,"I wasn’t as hot on the first Deadpool. It was fine as an R-rated superhero movie that finally gave Ryan Reynolds a platform to be Ryan Reynolds. The thing I liked most about it was that it was actually surprisingly a solid love story. 

I preferred Deadpool 2. It’s another example of ‘bigger is better’ in sequel building but for once I think it is actually better.  Found it very funny, loved how silly it went with the humour - a big Celine Dion ballad. Liked how it went pushed more against the forth wall. Liked how it lampooned superhero team ups with the coming together of X force. 

Most of all, like the first movie, I really liked the surprising amount of emotional depth the characters had - mostly invested in Deadpool himself. It’s always been tricky doing superhero movies in which the hero is practically invincible or capable of healing himself until the point of death. But the way they portray Deadpool as literally depressed and suicidal was a really good way of anchoring the story. He’s a character who wants to die but is unable to die. ",8k9ob3

Russell was really good and you rarely see teens in films who feel that genuinely angry to the point that you want to just give up in them at times.

My biggest complaints: juggernaut cgi at times felt off, and negasonic teenage warhead felt underused.  They gave her gf more screentime.  Also i gotta dock the film marks fridging vanessa until the post credits.

dz7mp9g,"The utter and complete failure of the X-Force destroyed all of my expectations for this film... *and that's a good thing.* 

Meta reddit jokes aside: I thought their introduction was going to be played straight. This is when the movie turns into a full-length Avengers parody but then boom, everyone is dead. The whole thing was fucking hilarious. 

My only criticisms: it's probably 10 or 15 minutes too long. Domino, Weasel, and Dopinder were not all that funny. Domino at least had some cool fighting moments but a lot of the jokes for those characters fell flat. 

I thought the first Deadpool was good but it didn't live up to the hype. I didn't see in it theaters so maybe that might be why I didn't enjoy it as much as most people. I saw this in theaters and it was great. It also has the best end credit scenes out of any of the recent superhero flicks. ",8k9ob3

I will say the movie did get a tad too sentimental at parts, but not enough to be super off putting. X-Force scenes were hilarious and the best scenes of are were during the credits.

dza49da,"I liked it okay but it was pretty much what I was fearing.

I never liked the parts of Deadpool i saw before I saw the first movie. Trailers for the game, some comic pages on reddit. mostly just puns and edgy violence. But I was surprised by the first movie how much I ended up rooting for the romantic relationship. The fucking montage is still really good and funny. Then it kind of devolved into a messy third act action setpiece which I didn't much care for, but the movie had already build up a bunch of goodwill.

Deadpool 2 is basically that third act done better, with a bigger budget and more jokes with about an equal succes rate, but I never really got into the characters. There's a point where Colussus attacks Juggernaut and Deadpool says ""here comes the big CGI fight"", but it's just pretty much that. I liked Zazie Beetz as Domino, her (pretty interesting) superpower is also used in some inventive ways (enemy trips, she lands on an inflatable doll, etc), but it doesn't really change the nature of how the fights and the movie develop.

I laughed a couple of times and felt it was a pretty enjoyable way to spend two hours but was disappointed at the end that apart from some cute sight-gags it never really surprised me. It's fine. I'm sure I would have loved this if I was 14 though (not meant as a dig!). ",8k9ob3
dza6drd,"I think a good way of looking at this movie is that if Infinity war seemed like it was non stop action, then Deadpool 2 is non stop jokes and references.  Both make it work really well.

Deadpool 2 is pretty good.  The only thing I'd give it over the first would be a better antagonist this time around.  The Logan/Wolverine/Hugh Jackman references were fantastic.  Action was cool.

I loved the references to the comics, the Liefeld reference had me rolling, and I think they did better than the first film. My only complaint is the CG, but I imagine the budget wasn't directed so much to the CG as it was the actors. Better CG than the first film, but after awhile the cracks started to get bigger.

dz67lek,"A few thoughts after seeing this and thinking it over:

1) It didn't click for me during the movie, but it was kind of a cool tough that ""Your heart isn't in the right place"" figuratively and literally meant that Deadpool had to get shot in the heart for him to be reunited with her.   
2) I commented this earlier, but I absolutely adored the fact that the score where Logan was dying from last year was played when Deadpool was dying. Such a meta thing that only Deadpool can pull off, and it sort of comes back full circle to the beginning of the movie with him ""dying"" there.  
3) Surprise cameos from Brad Pitt need to be more commonplace. I saw the gag of Vanisher being an actual person coming, but I didn't expect it to be such an A-list actor for what was virtually an extra role. Incredible.   
4) Josh Brolin was awesome as Cable. I'm a little divided whether I liked Cable or Thanos more, because both were really awesome, complex, characters.  
5) The gag about Deadpool being a trainee really wasn't that funny and I don't know why they tried so hard to make it happen. Kind of reminded me of that ""It's not ripe"" gag from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 last year.  
6) I love that Russell was a fan of Tupac in this too, it's kind of a really awesome easter egg to Hunt for the Wilderpeople.   
7) I adored the fact that the stakes felt really real in this, through killing Vanessa in the beginning of the film and through having the X-Force get killed off, so that, during that final fight, it kind of felt like anyone could go.   
8) And lastly, that ""Sun is getting real low"" joke came out of nowhere and was fucking fantastic.   ",8k9ob3

I didn't care about his ongoing flashblacks with his gf, didn't think any of the jokes were funny except maybe one or two and even those were drawn out and just ended up becoming unfunny! I love Josh Brolin but I think he was an ill fit for Cable and the whole storyline with this boy was so annoying and boring. I wanted a real villian but instead it's this whole mission. All the side characters showed up for one moment, and then that's it. They didn't have enough time to do anything. Why even have the Xforce? Just to have the joke??

All in all a disappointment.

So many cool little jokes, but quite a few that if you didn't know the backstory you probably wouldn't understand.

They built the X-Force up in interviews which was great, just to have them get rekt immediately.

I think Deadpool 1 had more laugh out loud moments, mostly coming from it being a brand new movie/concept. Deadpool 2 had a slower burn which left me feeling good the entire way. Definitely still as good of a movie.",8k9ob3

dz91em3,"Good follow up to the first but there were quite a few things that bothered me. Let's start with the negatives:

- The pacing was pretty off for me. It didn't flow as naturally as the first one did. This one also seemed to have more 'forced' humour.


The goods:

- Josh Brolin's Cable was fantastic. His chemistry with Deadpool is undeniable. 

- JUGGERNAUT VS. COLOSSUS. I didn't read much comics when I was a kid because we couldn't afford them but I watch the cartoons religiously and seeing these two finally go at it is such a fucking treat. I didn't read much about Deadpool 2 before going into theatres so that Juggernaut surprise added to the experience. 

- The action was amazing. The truck scene is where we really see David Leitch's touch in this. 

- Deadpool saying ""The sun's getting real low big guy"" was a fucking riot. My favourite MCU reference. 

- 007 opening montage.

- End credits scene had me in stitches. 


The difference between the two movies for me is when I watched Deadpool again on Netflix - I watched it from the beginning to end. With Deadpool 2 I'll have to skip some parts to get to the good ones. ",8k9ob3

dz6njv0,"-Boy what a year Josh Brolin is having so far. Thanos was incredible and as a huge fan of X-Men TAS I felt like he pulled Cable right out of the cartoon and onto the big screen seamlessly. Domino was also great, they deserved more screen time. It didn’t really seem like they had much for Cable to do in this film.

-I wasn’t the biggest fan of the 1st so I’ll probably be in the minority here but I actually liked this one a bit more because of the characters surrounding Deadpool (Cable, Domino, Colussus). For me the first suffered from having a crappy villain; this one at times suffers from not really having a villain at all. 

-I think the movie had an issue similar to GoTG2 where it tried too hard at trying to one-up it’s predecessor in the jokes/music department. Many of the jokes missed more than they hit for me , especially the “death scene” that dragged on for way too long and then made it even worse when he came right back to life anyway. The dubstep jokes were huge misfires, and the “X-Men Trainee” joke was “It’s not ripe” all over again. TJ Miller in this was Drax in GoGT2 for me; so many tries at going for crowd laughter that it became cringe after a while.

-Juggernaut’s appearance was awesome and unexpected but god help anyone who still tries to make sense of the X-Men universe’s continuity in 2018. It’s a goddamn mess and at this point really should just be completely ignored for your sanity. 

-The kid was annoying but not to the point where he ruined the movie for me. I think the Essex subplot is kinda interesting despite lingering in the background as it can possibly serve as the X-Men’s seemingly impending insertion to the MCU soon.

I actually found some of the more obscure ones the funniest, like the Rob Liefeld reference other people have already pointed out, or the Breaking Bad one (or at least the one I assumed was a Breaking Bad reference).

The movie was strangely melodramatic at times, to the point where I thought Deadpool would turn to the camera and make fun of that fact, but that never happened. I don't think they were self-conscious about that fact.

Tim Miller's absence is noticeable. There was much less clarity in the action scenes—thankfully, nowhere near the level of other superhero movies. The plot also felt less straightforward and definitely not as tight.

Overall, I still loved the movie, probably just not as much as the first one. There were much less jokes (and less successful ones, too), but when the jokes hit, they hit much harder than the first movie did. The whole X-Force sequence was just pure, 24-carat high grade ~~gold~~ lead.

dz7ewg9,"Just got out.

It was good, not great. It was really funny, but not on the same level.as the first one. There were a lot more 4th wall breaks, which I liked. Deadpool was certainly obsessed with killing himself again, which there definitely is precedent for in the comics.

That title sequence was fantastic, I could practically hear the James Bond producers taking notes for Bond25.

I did like the way they basically fucked off the whole trailers, I heard rumors they were including Juggernaut but kinda figured it would be bullshit. That was entertaining. The fight between Juggernaut and Collosus was great. Cable looked pretty fucking cool. I'm shocked that I didn't catch a ""crank it up to 11"" joke.

The drama, for the most part, didn't really do it for me, but I did like the touching scene at the end when Wade is back to looking like Ryan Reynolds and you think ""oh holy shit, they weren't kidding when he said he was gonna die in this movie!"" Had they ended it right there, I would have been wowed. Instead the final 10ish minutes were a bit of a convoluted mess.

My other gripe is the CGI. It was shitty in some parts. Juggernaut's face looked weird, and Domino's first action sequence looked real bad. Like...real real bad. I did like Russel's CGI though, his fire abilities looked pretty neat.

That post credits sequence where he kills the Origins Deadpool and Ryan Reynolds right before he does Green Lantern was fucking hilarious. Even if the rest of the movie was shit, it would have been worth watching just for that. I could not stop laughing.

Ultimately, I think they suffered a bit from Sequelitis. It was not awful, but it was sooooo close to being great, that you almost feel a little disappointed.

Definitely worth seeing though.

Edit: also would like to add, Deadpool corrupting Colossus was such an entertaining bit. He finally gets him to say fuck at the end, and then shortly afterwards Colossus says fuck again.

But the movie really does pick up when Brolin comes in, and I would probably say I enjoyed the final action sequence/the ending more than anything in the first movie.

e07cyq9,"So, Deadpool 1 & 2 started me thinking, what stage are we in?:

 Christian Metz's model of genre development 1974

Metz theory was that genres of films are passed through stages of existence. These being:

-Experimental

-Classic

-Parody

-Deconstruction

http://cgroucott-tam6formmediaas.blogspot.com/2013/03/christian-metzs-model-of-genre.html

So:

We're starting Parody, and now that outer space is involved, are we even starting to approach Deconstruction?

P.S.  I also thought, ""haven't all of these happened before for this genre""?  But then, it's not like superhero stuff hasn't gone through phases before this, and you can renew old genres.

""The X-Force's entrance into battle out of the back of the plane is very similar (if not identical) to Iron Man's entrance to the Stark Expo at the beginning of Iron Man 2.

Barbara Streisand is the one singing ""Papa Can You Hear Me"" in the clip of Yentl we see Vanessa and Wade watching on their anniversary. Barbara Streisand is Josh Brolin's step mother.

Rob Liefeld is vaguely referenced when DP and Domino are talking about her powers. ""Who would make up those powers? Probably someone who can't draw feet!"" (Paraphrasing)

The cure for blindness mentioned in DP1 can be seen next to the cocaine also mentioned in DP1.

Vanessa says ""I know."" To Wade's ""I love you."" A *very, very* obvious reference to *Empire*. Making this the third time Vanessa has referenced the Star Wars franchise""",8k9ob3

While there's a couple of jokes that suck (dubstep jokes, Russell's jokes) the rest land consistently. I love the much-improved colour pallette and the noticeable increase in gore. There are some scenes where the visuals aren't as consistent like how the prison scene is coloured vs the look of the Essex home and the CGI is also a little mixed. However, this didn't detract from my overall enjoyment. A lot of people in the thread will watch it, nitpick later and kill their own enjoyment. I can't think of much that I actually had a problem with.

Also, the joke writing is surprisingly ""layered"". There's jokes within jokes and those jokes follow on, which means I'm gonna end up rewatching it at some point just so I can try and find them. 

EDIT: I also forgot to mention how much more I liked Deadpool as a character this time around. Instead of being a walking, talking meme, he's a seriously flawed person with a decent dramatic arc. Cable was great too because they played him completely straight. It meant other characters could rip into him and then still be taken seriously.",8k9ob3
dz6jkdu,"-Almost certainly funnier than the first. Few jokes run too long for sure, but I think I'll remember specific humorous moments more from the sequel than it's predecessor.

-AMAZING post credit scenes. Probably the most hilarious thing I've seen all year in a movie. Nothing that lays groundwork for a sequel, but just LMFAO


-Brilliant casting of Brolin as Cable. Of course Reynolds is still solid as Deadpool. Would be OK with a Domino spin-off, very interesting character.

-Emotionally empty. The first movie was billed by Deadpool himself as a love story and it really was, kind of moving in a way. This one is billed as a family film about teamwork but I never felt that invested in this dynamic, making some of it feel forced.

-Think this movie struggles with a lack of a true or central villain. Ed Skrein's Ajax might have been one note, but he was a good heel you wanted to see get his comeuppance. At times the baddie is Cable, sometimes, Firefist, sometimes, the orderly. Wasn't expecting the reveal of Juggernaut but he comes so late it's kind of hard to see him as an unstoppable badass. 

-Believe the lack of a true villain messed up the pacing for the first 30 minutes or so.

-Anyone else underwhelmed by the action? Nothing shoddy but from the director who did half of John Wick and the awesome fight scene(s) in Atomic Blonde, it was pretty average in my opinion.

dz9quyq,"I really liked this movie, even better than the first one.

A couple things bout it:

 
* Even though the riffle flying to Cable and his shields were all probably just tech, my head canon is that it was all Telekinesis.


* I loved the Hope call-out.


* Probably not intentional but when Deadpool got blasted by Firefist near the end and he was all covered in dust and ashes, his whole costume looked like the grey and black one from X-Force.",8k9ob3

dznu768,"Holy shit! Saw this a second time sober and with my girlfriend and my opinion of the film had definitely changed. On my first viewing I had a problem with pacing, and I definitely think the  could cut a couple of gags, and they could've improved the pacing a little .

But on second viewing this movie really exceeds the first one. I've heard a few YouTube critics say this movie felt safe and that the fourth wall breaks didn't push the envelope, but I think it's hard to defend that position. The movie *is* self-aware and tells us at the start they are stealing the plot from Logan to make satire. However the effect of that artistic decision had much more impact the second time around. Also, I forgot to read the opening credit scene the first time around, but I was dying the second time.

I'm changing my score from 7/10 to 9/10. 

A lot of people thought the kid was cringey. I did too, but I also got the sense that was the point of his character. He's a subversion of Dafne Keen's character in Logan. Where Laura was a killing machine (like Logan), Russel was just an asshole (like Deadpool). When you consider the fact that the character Deadpool basically manufactures the whole movie just to give himself a dramatic death scene it really puts the whole film in context, especially the mid credit scene.

Another criticism I see is that the movie played it too safe, but I don't think that was the case. There was the dick shot, extremely brutal violence, very niche humor, child lead, heavy use of CGI, and killing the lead heroine in the first act. Those are all huge risks for any movie, much less a sequel.",8k9ob3
dznumzh,"Maaaan, haven't seen it mentioned here, but did ANYONE catch the fact that it was named Essex House (the orphanage)? As in... Nathaniel Essex, the name on the briefcase in the end credits scene of X-Men: Apocalypse?... as in... Mister-fucking-Sinister? I'm really hoping we get Mister Sinister in an upcoming movie because it seems they are really teeing him up to be the next possible baddie they tackle after Dark Phoenix. I think he'd fit in well in the next Deadpool/X-Force/X-Men movie.",8k9ob3

I wasn't sold on it at first (killing off a love interest that early in a sequel is usually just a way for bad writers to avoid further developing a relationship), but the story seemed much more solid than the original's and it was way more heartfelt than I thought it would be while still being pretty funny.

Otherwise, this was incredibly entertaining. I lost it multiple times throughout the movie. Juggernaut was a fantastic surprise. The brawl between him and Colossus was a treat. All of the x force getting Final Destinationed was great. And despite my initial dislike of Domino’s design (I’ve warmed up a little to it) she was one of the best parts of he movie.

I think the movies are overrated because no one seen a superhero movie so mature, that's why the movie Kick Ass was a big deal, but that wasn't a real superhero, actually if you order or find real comics probably online a lot of them have blood and killing and swearing, the Wolverine comic's were bloody and cut apart and the spiderman comics had killing, just the only difference I seen with the Deadpool comics are Deadpools sense of humor and non caring, but everyone forgets Lobo.",8k9ob3

A large group of people I sat directly in front of were hollering at every gag and laughing super loudly before jokes would land. I've never had to deal with an experience where an audience sort of sucked some joy out of the movie for me. 

On its own merits, I think it was funny enough. More joke heavy and most of them landed just fine but I think the plot is way less interesting and I felt myself getting a little restless when things were coming to a close.

dzl57kh,"Went for Round 2 today with a friend who hadn't seen it and we both had a great time, as did my theater despite naturally being less packed than last week. Been reading Gail Simone's Twitter lately on how she doesn't actually view Vanessa's death as a traditional fridging because she continues to have a presence throughout the story (as opposed to just disappearing and giving the male a bit of grief), and I think that fits with where I'm at with it now in terms of why I wasn't super bothered by it or, at least, part of why the film won me back as I like the afterlife scenes (acoustic Take on Me was a nice touch ;_;). Plus, Vanessa's back at the end so, as young Anakin Skywalker would say, yippee! 

Overall, I appreciate how the story continuously ties into the theme of family which, while it may not be wildly original (what is at this point?), is executed with enough of the sort of uniquely raunchy, meta nature of the character to work well. From what I've read of the comics, Deadpool definitely works best when he's being ridiculous (and violent) but still has heart at his core (I think of examples like Joe Kelly's Spider-Man/Deadpool where Peter initially thinks Wade is just an idiot but discovers new shades of him when he finds out he has a daughter he takes care of on the side apart from all the merc business). 

On second viewing, I was also able to appreciate Josh Brolin and Zazie Beetz's performances that much more. Cable is a really funny straight man whose dynamic with Deadpool made me crave a straight up Deadpool & Cable film - you can bet I'll be looking into those comics! - and Domino's swagger/charisma and Rube Goldbergian action sequences are a lot of fun. I'm really excited to see more of them both in the future, and I honestly was not expecting to be so interested in X-Force prior to seeing this film but I'm totally down now. In fact, I have to say that this particular branch of superhero films is one I'm willing to follow more so than any other just because of its distinct flavor (and why I'm a wary of the Disney acquisition because I don't want a monopoly that homogenizes all this). 

At this point, having seen it twice, I can now firmly settle on my rating of an A-/A or, for the purposes of this poll, a 9/10. In other words, I can definitely say I loved it! For reference, I feel the first film is more of a B/B+ and thought this film clearly made use of its budget to get more creative and capitalize on the first's potential by getting out of the origin story box.

The CGI was really good, apart from the car that hit the gas station and one part in the Colossus/[Juggernaut](#spoiler) showdown where Colossus threw [Juggernaut](#spoiler) and it looked a little off.

It seemed to me like Wade was a *bit* more super than he was in the first one, or maybe they just showed it. Him perceiving the world in slo-mo for a bit at the start, and also some moments like him getting hit by a car where he should have some broken bones. Personally, I enjoyed it. Rule of cool and all.

The x-Force was great, [even though I wanted to see a little more of them](#spoiler). Jokes were mostly spot on, and Cable was awesome.

Music was hit or miss for me. Bangarang is the stereotype of dubstep so it's understandable, take on me was good, but some of the music choices took me out of the scene..

I think it's one of his most important character traits but the execution was terrible in the comics. Subbing Vanessa for Lady Death is such a good plot point  and conveniently sends her off before the movies had to acknowledge her  comics history. And while it was kinda in ""girlfriend in refrigerator"" territory, it's not as bad as just killing her off and that's it.

Pros:

The soundtrack. (more so the juggernaut song at the end of the credits)

the cast was great everyone did a great job. (Julian Dennison did an amazing job, he sold his role beautifully)

Domino (Zazie nailed her role).

all the references and easter eggs the basic instinct and alpha flight where my favorites.

THE MOTHERFUCKING JUGGERNAUT

Cons:

The story was a little weak, not the most original concept but they managed to make it work.

wish we could've seen alpha flight do more.

The start of the movie was weak and too much like the original, but everything after vanessa's death was great.

lack of bob from hydra.

Overall I loved the movie and it has almost nothing I would change, it was a thrill ride, though going to a double feature and seeing the first deadpool definitely helped it out and made the second one more enjoyable.",8k9ob3

It would have been more interesting to see it not change, which would implicate that even though Russell has changed, a completely new set of events occurs between now and then that results in the death of his family or, quite possibly, all of humanity.

Definitely the action scenes were pretty incredible. But I didn't understand why Colossus didn't immediately jump to Deadpool's aid when Deadpool mentioned Juggernaut. Like I know you are mad at him but a seriously powerful person is now loose whom you dealt with before? 

Did anyone else totally get disappointed when lines they repeated in the trailer weren't in the movie? ""That's what happens when you get older.""

Two things made the movie not as good as the first.

Don't get me wrong, I think it was a really funny movie, but at the same time, it felt kinda exhausting to watch? I laughed at pretty much all the jokes, but I felt like some of the jokes could've been shorter. There were a quite a bit of times when a joke would come out, and it'd really funny. Then the very next joke would just be a play on the previous one, but it was still funny. Then etc. etc., until it just became kinda stupid? (However, it did work on me a few times... such as the demise of the XForce kept cracking me up)

The other thing to me was that there was a layer of seriousness in the first movie that made it feel like there was an actual struggle. This had a very thin layer of seriousness IMO, and so the struggles didn't feel as hard to overcome. Even though I think worse shit happened in this movie than in the first. ",8k9ob3

I had fun, but they may have learned the wrong lessons from the original: there are so many jokes that don't relate to the on-screen action or ripped directly from pop culture that it feels more like Family Guy than an action movie. For every joke that was wildly creative like Beast closing the door in the X-Mansion, there was a flurry of MCU or obscure song references.

I did really like Domino (Zazie Beetz also killing it on Atlanta), Cable, the slow build-up to Juggernaut & the mid-credits sequence. There's a lot of good stuff, but it feels buried under an avalanche of one-liners: the original movie had a better balance between plot & comedy.",8k9ob3

In the end she's saved and we see that the entire film still happens, so why not just use another motivation for plot?

I like the way the film interacts with the franchise, it felt very similar to the way the comics do it - it's the same world, follows pretty much the same rules, but takes itself less seriously and realises it doesn't have to clash.  

Loved the X-Force bit, it was a great joke, but I kinda hoped the team was really a thing at the same time.

By the end of the film I felt oversaturated with reference homour, and also realised I'm way past the target audience age when the ""you're going to google dubstep when you get home"" line hit and the girl that sat next to me went ""I'm totally going to google it""

Too many callbacks and forced landings, (and Vanessa's dialogue/delivery in the beginning reeked of ""I'm going to die in a few moments,"") but it was solid enough to carry the plot along. I like how they touched on DP's more serious side of his character. Once the X-Force actually took off, it got its traction back from a humor/action perspective. From *then* on, I liked it better than the first. Cable and Domino kicked so much ass, I'm so happy they're finally on the silver screen. All the action scenes and most of the jokes stuck from the parachuting on.

I feel like Russell only started to want to kill just because the plot demanded it.

Makes you wonder how things will change as far as number of characters involved if Disney does acquire 21st Century Fox.

dz68zos,Unpopular opinion: It was a good movie but I think I would've enjoyed the film better if Deadpool 2 released before Infinity War. To go from that superhero movie to deadpool felt like driving a Lamborghini and swapping for a camry. ,8k9ob3

1. Juggernaut never really juggernauted. We never saw him really momentum his way through anything.

All I know is that it felt like it maybe had a little less heart in it. The first movie was sort-of an underdog, while I think they went into this one knowing it will do well.  Not to say this movie was bad by any means. It was fantastic.

The death-compilation of X-force, playing Skrillex's ""Bangarang"" during Cable's fight scenes, baby-legs Deadpool... there were so many jokes that made me laugh so hard I had tears in my eyes. The first one only really made me do that with the ""Women's Day"" scene.

I'd rate it 9/10, though I am biased when it comes to comedies. Also, why wasn't Stan Lee in this one?",8k9ob3
dz7wg8u,"Julian Dennison is such an odd choice to play Rusty Collins aka Firefist. Also, Shatterstar claims his name is Rusty while Firefist says his name is Russell. Any idea why the writers are making these changes? Makes no difference to the overall plot; just seems odd.

As much as I liked the first one, it felt like ""Hey here's Reynolds as Deadpool making jokes, just like you guys wanted!"" which is fine but it felt like a showcase for the character and not a story.

This time they made it feel like an actual movie, there was a world and a story and Deadpool was a part of it, breaking the 4th wall is most effective when you clearly establish a wall to begin with and they did that much better this time around.

I was also caught off guard by how well they integrated heavier, more emotional stuff while still keeping it a comedy.  If the MCU has gotten better at sprinkling comedy amidst the drama/action Deadpool is becoming the inverse sprinkling just enough heart into the absurdity.",8k9ob3

  That being said I don't think it's as good as the first one. It does the bad sequel thing of constantly referencing the first movie. Which gets kind of annoying. (Though I did like the callback of there actually being a bunch of coke and the cure for blindness in the house.)

  I don't like how they kill Vanessa in the first couple of minutes. A big part of the first movie is actually the romance and it informs all of DP's actions. With her dead he's left with nothing to do but mope until he eventually decides to get the plot moving. Plus you just know she's coming back, so as an audience member you don't care one way or the other. I was actually a little annoyed at the opening credit gag telling me I was supposed to feel, ""OH did they Really just do that!?!?."" No, opening credits I'm just biding my time till you magic her back to life somehow.

If anything, this shows that Fox has the right idea for the next films  - keep the Deadpool standalones small scale and the X-Force ones with far less ""Deadpool moments.""

Saturday morning rolls around. I check the movie times again just to make sure. They completely changed their schedule. They went from 3 DP2 showings to 18, and they also had 7 Infinity War showings. No other movie (which means that Josh Brolin was in every moving being shown at the theater). That meant that there was a DP2 showing every 30 minutes.

The city we live in isn't very big, so the result actually was that there was maybe 3 other groups of people in the theater with us. It was nice.

Edit: guess I should talk about the movie. It was great! Enjoyed it more than the first, and I already enjoyed the first a lot.

My friend and I have been discussing the implications of Deadpool having time travel. I have a theory that they wrote in the time machine as sort of a scapegoat whenever the Disney/Fox buyout completes and the inevitable X-Men reboot for the MCU happens.

I really liked that all the goofyness of the Deadpool is behind the mask. His badass movements are increased ten fold whenever he wears the mask. And whenever something serious is being delivered he never talks with the mask on and the scene is set with Ryan Reynolds face showing with mask off, even in the last scene when there was no premise for scene to change firefist takes off the mask when Deadpool says last goodbyes to everyone. 

Overall the attention to detail and providing all the characters to have their movements with the commentary of Deadpool were the best movements in the movie.

Probably the Brad Pitt cameo and the Post-Credits were funny as shit, and there were more pedophile jokes than Minecraft videos.

Although I still stand\-by a lot of those criticisms, something ""clicked"" for me when I went to see it a second time. I was taken aback by how much depth and heart Deadpool 2 has for a movie featuring visceral decapitations and prolonged dick jokes. I found the themes of the film to be genuinely touching and I really enjoyed how they developed Deadpool's character. For a goofy psychopath, they really made him complex, relatable and sympathetic. So many great, emotional scenes. I also caught more of the jokes the second time around, and I was laughing pretty hard at some of the nerdier, obscure jokes. They had a lot of guts to include such esoteric references in a huge, mainstream blockbuster like this.

Deadpool 2 isn't as funny or fresh as the original, but I admire it a lot for its surprising amount of complexity and nuance. This is a really solid sequel and I can't wait to see where they go next with X\-Force!",8k9ob3

Only critique I have is the kid, I think he should have been played completely deadpan serious. DP works best when he is the only one ""in"" on the sillyness of it/doing tongue-and-cheek comedy. His breaking the 4th wall and 'out of place' sillyness works best when the other characters aren't in on it, and are playing serious characters. The kids 'prison wallet' scenes and fighting (getting punched in the face a bunch) the biggest guy in the pen felt at times like ti was too much.

It was also quite a nice tight film and raced by, whilst this was a bit more overstuffed, tried to be a little more dramatic which didn't quite work and felt its length more - I was ready for the film to end when it did.

Saying that though this was still an absolutely fun ride of a film and had just so many laughs and the references got me good. Brolin was great as Cable as well. Overall, very much a worthwhile movie, it just wasn't as fresh as ghe first to me.",8k9ob3

dz6b8kv,"I'm probably gonna get alot of flak for this, but I gotta say, the first one had Deadpool as a much more natural character. Here, he just feels weird.

His introduction in the first film felt like just a normal day for him: It mixed so fluently his most badass nature and his childish demeanour. In this one however, it felt like he was just childish. The humour didn't resonate as well as it did in the first; the first had some hilarious moments just because it felt like Deadpool's childish nature came in full force to the film's violence. In this film it felt more based on quips and edgy one-liners that'll go out of style after a year. 

There were some moments that got to me, scenes with Domino were amazing (She's pretty overpowered when you think of it), the entire X-force team dying in spectacular ways and Brad Pitt's cameo had me in tears (Its randomness felt more like the humour of the first film), but altogether those were outweighed by the strange pacing and editing this film suffered from. 

Cable didn't feel like a full threat and his character didn't really go anywhere, nor was his character in the end really justified (especially with his decision in the end). ",8k9ob3
dz6r0ml,"Some of the fourth wall stuff was pretty lazy, and the action scenes weren't all that spectacular. Opening action montage was the only really well done action, while the rest was more comedy focused and felt less thrilling.

dz6m43n,"10/10

I thought it was outstanding. I loved the short cameos, the jokes, the seriously emotional parts, the new characters, everything. I'm very much hoping this XForce storyline continues. ",8k9ob3
dz81bp0,"This movie is a lot better than Deadpool 1. The music fits the flow of the film to a tee and I'd say that it really tells the story of Deadpool 2 really well.

This film does not get bogged down by the ""making"" of Deadpool so to speak as it did in the first movie and that really allows for a very clean and aerodynamic movie that really just keeps going, keeps adding pieces and keeps adding tension to a film that is surprisingly heartfelt and emotional while keeping it comedic and keeping it Deadpool.

The characters were great and seeing as this is the sequel obviously even more fleshed out than before. They get Domino really right! (and this was the character that if the movie **was** bad, then either Domino was not well done **or** she saves the movie. No middle ground) And the movie even made fun on how Domino can really have luck as a superpower. 

The main cast of Deadpool 2 are all beloved and not one of them were miscast in any way, Josh Brolin as Cable was a match made in heaven just like Hugh Jackman's casting as Wolverine or Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. He gets Cable correct in every sense of the word and I hope they keep using his character before Brolin gets too old for it.

A bigger and better adventure comedy than Deadpool One, more stakes, more laughter, more badass moments. The only thing I could see was that CGI looked like CGI and that [The beginning of them literally skydiving, like them immediately falling off the plane looked worse imo than the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers' awesome skydiving scene](#spoiler) and that was my only complaint.

9/10, Domino is great, they got her right thank God, Zazie Beets is amazing. Deadpool = GJ Ryan Reynolds, Cable is Josh Brolin and vice versa, the X-Men in this movie were awesome, Colossus and Negasonic were a sight for sore eyes. In a movie where characters are key and basically the whole movie (I'd watch Deadpool and crew just do just about anything) They got it right again. 9/10.",8k9ob3
dz8i31e,"Ultimately, I enjoyed it but it wasn't nearly as good as the first one. Felt forced like the second Guardians movie. 

My favorite bits:
-The opening credits parodying Bond
-Smashing the cocaine in his mask (with the callback from the first movie with the two bags of cocaine and ""cure for blindness"" on the box)
-Russell (who I feel like no one is talking about) - he's like if the kid from ""Up"" got an R-rated upgrade
-""You killed Black Tom, you racist son of a bitch!""
-X-Force (and that wonderful little cameo)
-Domino's sequences were amazing to look at, loved her.
-""Shirt-cockin' it"" scene (feat. Basic Instinct reference).
-Josh Brolin was wonderful and badass
-(after the bullet scene on the van) ""...Ow.""
-Dopinder (he was wonderful and I didn't think he'd stand as a character)
-Overall the emotion hit a lot harder in this film. The jokes were there and pervasive, and it's still Deadpool, but it felt much more resonant. Deadpool had a purpose. Everyone learned from everyone.
-The end credit sequence had me DYINGGGG

It was a good movie overall, just wish it could've retained more of the effortlessness of the original film.",8k9ob3
dz9vfrb,"Who else agrees with me that Deadpool should have stayed dead? Think about it. Deadpool didn't let Colossus take off the neck brace that could have prevented him from dying, he has always hinted at wishing to die in the comics, and he just really wanted to be with Vanessa in the end.

I was excited for it and knew that i'd have fun, but it blew my expectations out of the water and had me f***in beeming from start to finish.

A Female sidekick who isnt a forced love interest, and doesnt need saving because the universe has her taken care of, leaving her open to kick ass and luck out. The humor was perfect.

dz6cntd,"Deadpool 2 is a hilarious reintroduction to the fourth-wall breaking ""merc-with-a-mouth."" With a larger budget at hand, Ryan and director David Leitch brings all the comedy from the last movie while adding more modern references (*where was the Atlanta reference? Seriously, Fox still owns FX.*). The movie consists of a time travel plot, some amazing cameos, and a hit-or-miss message about ""faith and family."" Though the film takes a while to get going, the jokes are entertaining enough to keep the audience attentive. Finding a boring moment will be hard. Asides from Deadpool, Cable, and ""Firefist,"" hardly any of the characters develop at all. It makes them feel like cardboard cutouts. In fact, the film makes fun of this through the Negasonic's girlfriend, Yukio, who is all but a smiling face until the after-credits scene. The film could have used more moments like that one. Also, the editing felt a bit off at time. There are sharp cuts and transitions from one scene to another. It feels as if some connecting scenes were left in the editing room. Overall, Deadpool 2 is the first film and more with a time traveling plot and a few harsh editing issues. Go see this in theatres at least twice. 

edit: Juggernaut was credited ""As Himself."" Teddy Perkins was credited as the same in Robbin Season... ",8k9ob3
dz6ejhn,"I thought this was better than the first one. At least this one felt like it has some rewatching value in it unlike the first one, where pretty much all the jokes felt old immediately during second viewing.

The action was pretty much non-stop and it was awesome! At times I did felt like though that the action was starting to be at the expense of the story, but... I was just really, really entertained by all the mayhem the characters caused.

I pretty much fell in love with Domino @_@ It was also really fun idea that her power was basically just her being incredibly lucky. I think Negasonic was pretty much the only one, who didn't have anything to do really and the movie pretty much just forgets her up until the end where she just shows up and makes a convenient Ka-Boom to end the fight :/ I also really liked what they did with Colossus in this one and the scene where Deadpool is talking to him under his window like a boyfriend trying to say he's sorry was the greatest thing ever.

Some of the jokes fell a bit flat and I think the movie tried way too hard to be funny especially at the beginning. It took a pretty long while for my audience to start laughing at any of the jokes. Fortunately the humor got better as the movie went along.

As a pretty big negative, I thought the time travel stuff at the end was pretty... eeehh? As it went along, it just started to make no sense at all? Like when Deadpool was dying, the kid was saved and Cable's rabbit wasn't covered in his daughters blood anymore, Cable then goes back in time where the kid is still on the rampage and the rabbit is somehow still clean now? And then Deadpool goes back in time to save his girlfriend, which pretty much makes the rest of the movie not happen at all? I guess it can all be explained by ""It's Deadpool so it's ok"" and it shouldn't be taken that seriously, but to me, the movie is breaking it's own logic at this point. The jokes about Wolverine: Origins and Green Lantern were great though

I think there was a missed opportunity in the X-Force recruitment scene, why not have anyone from the MCU show up there as a joke? Imagine someone like Thor sitting there and noping out of there. I know Thanos did his thing in the Infinity War, but if you can be fine with Deadpool basically undoing the whole movie by time traveling then this isn't that big of a stretch here in my opinion.

The truly subversive moments (the demise of the X-Force, the surprise cameos and the post credits scene) were brilliant, but lots of the jokes didn't land for me (humour is personal, I understand if you loved all of them). I don't really find endless pop culture references and name calling that funny, and it felt pretty incessant in this film.

I thought Julian Dennison was miscast, he's great in Hunt for the Wilderpeople but I think a better actor was needed to sell what he was saying - a lot of his dialogue was very cheesy.

It lent too much on the first film, which is understandable to an extent, but several jokes and scenes were just extended versions of jokes from Deadpool (regrowing limbs, the slow mo vehicle crash etc).

Overall a decent film, but I'm not itching to see it again like I was with the first.",8k9ob3

A little bit too many pop culture references but i liked that they made him more human, though he's a murderous jerk, he does have a softer side. 7/10",8k9ob3
dz8b1ww,"It’s funny. It’s entertaining. I had a pretty good time watching it, but it’s missing the emotional core from the original. It pales in comparison to the original in just about every way but it’s a fun movie, regardless.

I love Ryan in the role, he was born to play this character, and he’s definitely good here but it makes me appreciate how much more nuanced his performance is in the original. Josh Brolin is terrific as Cable but there isn’t enough of him to get you invested. Morena Baccarin as Vanessa- love her in the original but I'm not sure the dreamy 'afterlife' sequences worked for me and she was wasted in this.
Thought some of the characters that came back from the first film were mishandled, or simply not in it enough, while some new characters, like Domino and Cable, were fun and a welcome addition. This film is what I was afraid it was going to turn into once the original DEADPOOL director, Tim Miller, left the project: too scattershot, and missing the heart of the first film. 

It’s a good-looking movie for the most part and I’m a fan of Jonathan Sela (JOHN WICK, ATOMIC BLONDE) but I miss how much Deadpool’s red suit stood out in the original. I feel like Sela’s usual affinity for a more cold, desaturated color palette worked against him sometimes and Deadpool’s suit looked damn-near purple in some scenes. 

Tries to do too much in 2 hours— either it should’ve had a longer runtime or they should’ve simplified the story. 
Again, I sound like I didn’t like the movie… I had a perfectly good time with DEADPOOL 2 but it’s just not as focused, contained and interesting as the first DEADPOOL. Definitely worth checking out though. 
",8k9ob3
dzixif6,"Overall I enjoyed it, though I don't like call backs because I'm really picky about them and prefer that they be subtle and not slapped into your face.  Brolin's character was actually interesting and even though he's not talkative, the writing was great for him.   The kid however, came out really cringy and I really didn't like his character that much.  Maybe all his lines being cringy was intentional but god damn did the line ""Damn it feels good to be a gangster"" sound really fucking awful.  

A lot of sequels try to top what they did in the first one and think that trying to just double or outdo what they did in the first one is the way to go, and Deadpool 2 is guilty of this. At moments it felt like they were trying too hard.  The 4th wall break to 'cue music' was used twice and it felt like it really should have been a 1 per movie thing.  Colossus's character was used more but while trying to develop his character, it just felt like he became a caricature of himself in the first movie.  Compare this to Negasonic who felt like they stayed the same across both movies, maybe because there was less screen time.  Liked her role in this one even though the 'trainee' joke was a dud.

Brolin, again, did a great job and I really loved his character, him being a 'good guy' in this was a great surprise for me and him being after the kid and not Wade won points with me as far as plot goes.

And plot-wise, winning the kid over through 'sacrifice' felt like some kind of Deus Ex Machina, ""ah shit we gotta fix this somehow"" bit and came off as sloppy, awkward and silly.  Also, I know Deadpool was late for his Anniversary ...meeting? but him running away from those group of guys near the start felt off.  

I really enjoyed the action sequences and Domino's 'show of force' bit. Out of most of the modern Marvel movies, Cable and Deadpool's fight at the mutant school/place has got to be my favorite fight scene.  

I don't think the credit scenes should count for the movie since they're just bits but I just want to give props for how fun they were.

Again, overall I enjoyed it. And for once I think I actually agree with a RT rating. 80-ish% is absolutely fair.

Speaking of 80-ish%, I am about 80-ish% sure  that they switched Cable's glow eye when he was drinking that beer. I know he was standing in front of a mirror but it really looked like they switched it to his right eye and it wasn't just a mirrored shot.  (Unless it just does that.)",8k9ob3
dz7w2ch,"It was . . . OK. Lots of inside jokes and asides but I felt like the audience that I viewed it with. Some laughs, more out of recognition than anything else. Was it memorable? Not really.

I hope that if Disney truly does reboot the X-men franchise to fit it with the MCU, that they leave Deadpool the way he is. Ryan Reynolds is too perfect for the part.

""Reese, Wernick, and Reynolds has proven once again that they know this beloved character in and out so much that they never seem to lose focus of his stories being HIS stories. Besides capturing the superhero and humorous aspects of him, they maintain Wade’s humanity by displaying his emotional side. The majority of this plot focuses on Wade’s reaction to tragedy and trying to get in control of his feelings. Here, we see him at his very worst where he has to face reality and the consequences of his actions. Just like its predecessor, this is another character story that displays the depth of Deadpool in ways we’ve never witnessed before.""

Why the fuck did Cable had to use the time machine to save DP, either he didn't care for his wish to actually die and could've just destroyed the collar with his gadgets or he did care for his wish and would let him stay dead. And he made this nonsensical bullshit decision at the cost of never being able to see his family again, which he seemingly cares more about than the entire world. I know they needed a reason to keep him in that timeline for future movies, but they could've easily came up with something better. I actually loved Domino's power because it actually makes sense in a world with superpowers, magic, ghosts and shit to have someone that is magically lucky, she was established and she was really cool, so I didn't mind her just having anything she wants be served on a silver platter, but Cable was suppose to be the serious bad-ass to juxtapose to DP's shenanigans and they ruined him at the end :(",8k9ob3

dz6aun0,"Deadpool 2 is better than infinite war, let's argue ",8k9ob3
dz6lntl,"As much as I enjoyed this sequel, the film is heavily flawed.

One of my biggest issues with Deadpool 2 is that there is a point in the movie, right in the second act, where it peaks in hilarity and absurdity. The sequence where all of the X-Force are killed an insanely graphically way that could’ve been taken straight out of “South Park” but leaves you in both shock and laughter to a point that will have you wheezing. 

But here’s the thing: not only is the film unable to make you erupt in laughter as hard as that sequence (until the post credits sequence which might be the best post credit sequence in a comedy movie since the meta end credit sequence in “22 Jump Street”) but they don’t give you enough airtime for you to catch your breath. Because of the film not being able to let you breathe after shelling out joke after joke, you start to feel the film’s length which by any means does not need to be close to two hours.

That said, I died several times watching this. That Beyonce one-liner had me gagging for days. As in I saw this 10 days ago and I've been chucking ever since.

dzmb9uv,i loved the movie but i cant believe deadpool became a crime fighting shit-swizzler who rooms with a bunch of other little whiners at the Neverland Mansion of some creepy old bald heavens gate looking motherfucker,8k9ob3
e3pg6jx,"So, first of all, I would like to say that this review is highly subjective. It is ok if you don't share my opinion:

This movie was...better than the first. Right off the bat, I will say that I really don't like Deadpool as a character. He is, in my opinion, one of the most if not the most overrated comic book character. He can be summed up by one sentence: ""Look at me I'm so random!"". His humor alternates between bad and not so good jokes and I don't see how someone older than an edgy 13 years old would find them funny. His breaking the fourth wall might have been funny and original the first few times they used it, but it's so overused by now. As such, I really didn't like the first movie, because their was way too much Deadpool in it. It was like 10% thin plot and 90% randomly inserted jokes. It felt like watching a 2 hour long Family Guy episode (That's really not a good thing, by the way).

The second movie, on the other end, was much more plot driven, and the larger supporting cast took the spotlight away from Deadpool enough to make it enjoyable. I particularly liked Cable and Domino. They are really the best parts of this film in my opinion.

Anyway, as I said, that's just my opinion, feel free to disagree with me.",8k9ob3
dz6um0d,"It was fun, but all that emotional stuff between the Vanessa dragged for more screen time than needed. Characters like Dopinder and Cable were way funnier than expected, but you can't ignore that the movie completely does a shitty movement by taking all the character motivation to the trash with a post-credits scene.",8k9ob3
dz86a0k,I can't believe Marvel let them use Drax,8k9ob3
dz9sflr,"Really good movie! So funny, action packed, though I’m not sure if it’s better than the first. Domino is freakin hot! I liked the scene where it cameos the actual X-men in that one room. The post credit scenes are genius!! I also enjoyed that Cable wasn’t the actual villain and became a hero or at least an antihero. 

Here’s all the MCU references I noticed. I can’t remember exactly what he said for them, but yeah: 

• You might as well give me a bow and arrow and call me Hawkeye. (Something like that) 
• DP said Cable had the winter soldier arm 
• Deadpool calling Domino black Black widow 
• Deadpool calling Cable Thanos 
• hey big guy, sun is getting real low (Hulk reference when fighting juggernaut). 
• edit: and yes, the brown panther line directed to Dopinder 

There were also several DC references such as Deadpool blatantly saying Superman and “I’m Batman”. 

I noticed there were way more DC and MCU references in this one than DP1. Why in this one was there way more of those references? 

The things I didn’t like: a lot of the cgi wasn’t good. Colossus’s cgi was somehow better in DP1. Russell absolutely annoyed me. I didn’t like the X-force being killed so quickly. I wish Weasel got more screen time. Yukio and Wade’s dialogue exchanges were cringe imo.

dz9sgih,"Man, something small that bothered me was other people in the theater. I hate when people laugh then clap. So annoying. ",8k9ob3
dzaewqv,"Some of the CGI in this movie was truly terrible. There was a bit at the start of the chase sequence where a few cars flipped and then a gas station blew up and it just looked ps2 cut-scene level really. Surprisingly, for a director who was involved in the John Wick movies, the action scenes in this movie were pretty forgettable. Enjoyed the movie enough overall though, easy 7/10. I would give the first movie a 9/10.",8k9ob3

A lot of people thought that Tim Miller was the driving force of what made Deadpool work but it seems they’ve done better without him. Laughed my ass off, but the hardest laugh all night was definitely that end of that muppet movie trailer ",8k9ob3
dz656i7,I loved it. My one real problem is a nerdy qualm with Juggernaut. I was stoked when he appeared. My issue is the film doesn't really use his powers. He's more than just a big strong baddie. Jugs ability is once he starts moving he can't be stopped. Usually I don't care if a film changes aspects of the comics but by not adhering to his power set from comics he is reduced to just a generic big strong bad guy. When Cable shoots Juggernaut he goes flying backwards I was very disappointed. I was particularly disappointed because it seems like the filmmakers were equally excited about bringing Juggernaut to the big screen.,8k9ob3
dz67uv5,Liked it a lot but it kinda sucks the best bit was pretty much stolen from MacGruber.,8k9ob3

dz6dc1r,"Deadpool 1 was a very hard act to follow because it used a lot of techniques which were a surprise to the Marvel genre, so it was very unlikely that Deadpool 2 could 'twist' the Marvel theme by the same degree again. That said, it was a good effort and likely a movie from which in-between laughs might be found. Ultimately though, the freshness of the first one could not be pulled-off a second time -- though the 'little legs' gag was fucking fun, albeit derivative. ",8k9ob3

dz6fyg3,"So I have to say I was kind of underwhelmed by it. I loved the first one. But this one seemed like the definition of studio notes. They repeated jokes from the first one as if it was because someone told them to because everyone love it in the first. 

""hey remember when deadpool made a joke about there only being 2 x men, let's do that gag again"" 

Or ""remember the baby hand gag, what about this time baby legs. And we will have each character enter separately so we can reuse the joke again and again for their reactions."" Christ that scene went on way too long too. 

And the meta references have him make more of them, people love wacky deadpool making 4th wall jokes. 
To me it suffers from the same problem as guardians vol 2. Where they just try to cram more jokes in as if that's all people want to see. 

It could have been better is all im saying. The x force bit was funny but went on a bit too long. Domino and cable were great. 

The end credits kind of make up for it cause that was funny as hell. But overall I thought it was no where near as good as the first. Probably not helped by the fact there was a teenage couple making out through the whole movie sitting next to me in a packed cinema. 

End of rant. ",8k9ob3
dz620kd,"It was ok. The fire kid was pretty cringey though, especially when he yells that phrase about being gangster ",8k9ob3
dz64ofh,"Just watched it. Thought it was alright, felt like a lot of the jokes didn't land. I'd say the original is still better.

Absolutely loved the Take On Me cover tho. ",8k9ob3
dz6c5ys,"So I saw this opening night since I really enjoyed the first movie.

I don’t think I’m alone in saying the first act was probably the weakest of the movie with the film picking up when they were sent to the Icebox.

I feel like they tried to cram as many fourth wall breaks and Meta references just because it worked the first time, and subsequently a bunch of them fell flat. 

With a slower opening act, this movie felt a touch too long even though it comes in with a significantly shorter run time than Infinity War. 

Really liked the X-Force, Collosus having to say fuck, Domino, the couch scene with Wades new legs, and the last ten minutes the best- including the mid credits scene and end credits song. Brolin was also a standout even though he was racist.

Didn’t like the first act, the CGI, the use of Juggernaut, and-this might be controversial- Firefist. I liked Julian in Hunt for the Wilderpeople, but he just felt like the wrong fit for the part here. Never quite getting the whole anger and rage that you’d expect of someone in his position. For me, he joins John Boyega in the overhyped actors box.

Overall, really funny movie that comes close to the first one. Solid 7/10 for me! Can’t wait to see more of Domino and Cable.",8k9ob3
dzesxfw,"I would say that I really liked the movie, but with caveats.

It's absolutely and surprisingly heartfelt in moments (especially more towards Cable's storyline and his resolution). When it's at it's best, the humor is the best in the franchise and beats out any other superhero movie to date. It's creative in it's execution of action set-pieces and physical comedy moments. I liked a lot of the cast, especially the newcomers like Josh Brolin and Zazie Beetz (although I wish they gave Domino a bit more personality). Solid music selection and fight choreography. I think a lot of the gags involving the mythology of the character in the comics and films is great, including how they reincorporate Venessa. Absolute kudos to Ryan Reynolds for sticking through the make-up and costume throughout the entire run-time (save for a small moment). 

Now the middling-to-bad: First, I think that this movie needed a better editor to trim some fat in terms of some jokes, included repeated one-liners, needed to be removed; there were even moments that felt like genuine editing mistakes in terms of timing. The CG is just....spotty at best. I'm talking about near-Black Panther levels of bad CG like the Colossus vs. Juggernaut fight. I didn't really believe the story of Wade growing to care for Russell as it just seemed to be a means to an end to get back with Venessa, so it just felt...off. Negasonic and Yukio were kinda pointless in the film and felt fairly arbitrary to the entire events of the story; in fact, it felt like they were really stretching how to incorporate previous characters into the story naturally (I had a similar feeling with Thor: The Dark World). The antagonists are somehow LESS developed than the previous film - how in the WORLD do you even do that? A lot more of the elements in this film feel much more ""inside baseball"" in terms of the references, like the reference to the original writer, as it's a lot more obvious and pervasive. 

There's a more good than bad here, but there are just some elements that just keep me from recommending it without reservation. ",8k9ob3
dz7au0p,"Movie was a huge step down from the original. The loss of director Tim Miller was felt. Part 2 was riddled with cheap-looking special effects and it couldn't land the proper tone for many of its scenes. While the original had some gross-out humor, usually it had another layer of intelligent humor on top of it. Here we have a much more frequent reliance on naked gross-out humor (pun intended).

Domino was the only thing added to this movie that A: was a fresh idea not already covered in the original movie and B: was done well. Her luck powers created a lot of fun moments and she had good chemistry with Deadpool. Cable was a failed attempt. If you bring a fan-favorite character into a movie, your job is to convince the general public why he's a fan-favorite character. Cable lacked the depth, development or awesomeness here to accomplish that goal.

A big problem with the movie's tone starts with the opening sequence. They insert a lot of darkness into what's supposed to be a gruesome but still light comedy, immediately weighing down the movie with a big burden to carry.

Another fundamental problem is just how abstract Deadpool's motivations are here. The first movie kept it correctly simple...motivated by fear of death, love, revenge. Here Deadpool is somehow motivated by the fuzzy memories of an apparition to be some kind of better person by saving a life, even while killing almost every other character in sight. The movie never decides what it believes. Does it really believe in this redemption storyline or does it think it's all something to be skewered for laughs? 

The indistinct and indirect nature of the motivating plot here would be more appropriate for an art film doing a deep character study. It's the kind of storyline that is impossible to make into a comedy. It's not cliched enough to create any expectations in the audience that the jokes can play against. Hence, the movie ends up buying into its fundamental story much more than it should, killing the potential for comedy. This is the kind of movie that should turned this basic plot into something anarchic and genre-busting. Instead it resolves its main plot with cliches as predictable and safe as something out of a Disney channel movie.

It was also embarassing just how much sitcom-level humor made it into the script. That stuff about continuing to call Deadpool a ""trainee?"" And the weird underuse of the new Asian female character, turning her into a really lame running joke where she's given nothing of substance to say at all.

Finally it almost goes without saying how weak the villains are in this movie. The first movie didn't have a great villain, but he looks like an all-time classic rogue compared to what we have here. And the surprise villain wasn't handled with any of the appropriate grandeur or mystique. Look to the lesser X-Men movies of the past to see potentially great villains handled in similarly uninspired fashion.

Reynolds as Deadpool tries hard and does a good job trying to save the movie from everything that doesn't work. But with bad villains, bad FX, bad jokes, bad characters and a bad plot...this was not a good movie.",8k9ob3
dz6sapd,Way better than Black Panther ,8k9ob3
dz6fz7s,"I really didn't enjoy Deadpool 2. The humour felt rather predictable and the action scenes didn't have any impact for me. Additionally, some of the CGI was god awful in this film... it's not excused just because they make a joke about it. Finally, I just couldn't get invested in the story, the plot just felt very loose for me and extremely small scale.",8k9ob3

dz81xuf,"Very messy plot, and it seemed to depend a little bit too much on the ""well, that's just lazy writing"" metajoke a few times to try and hide it. But I certainly laughed a lot and since it's a comedy that's the main goal. It also struck me that, as I said about Deadpool 1, the romantic elements of the film are miles beyond pretty much any comic book film other than Spider-Man 2 or Wonder Woman. Most comic book films don't even achieve half the romantic connection as this film.

I'm was a little annoyed by alterations to comic book canon with Cable and Domino but at the end of the day I don't actually care very much as these movies are just their own thing and are not interested in really adapting the Deadpool or Cable & Deadpool comic books.",8k9ob3

dz6323g,"#NON SPOILER REVIEW

This definitely wasn't on the same level as the first, but I had a really good time with it. The first 10 minutes and the last 30 minutes were pretty fantastic, but the middle had some issues. There was one scene in particular that gave me some serious feels. Also, another scene was one of the funniest scenes in a comedy that I have seen in years.

I'll admit that I wasn't feeling the Domino interpretation going into this movie, and I will 100% eat crow on it. The actress was a ton of fun in the role and I really enjoyed her character a lot.

Everything that was good in the original was good in this one, but I can't help but feel that some of the heart from the first film was lacking throughout the middle of the movie here. 

I was expecting a bit more from Cable, but he was fun for what we got. I love how right off the page he felt. They tried to give him a bit of heart, but I feel like they didn't give enough time to it to really make me feel anything.

Unpopular opinion, but the little boy was honestly by far and away my least favorite part of the movie. Any time he was on screen, my interest fell and the vibe of the movie felt off. He really wasn't funny and I didn't really enjoy his plot from a serious angle either. It's a shame he was the lynchpin of Deadpool's arc and the theme of the movie as a whole because he really didn't work for me. A certain subplot with him and DP in particular really didn't work for me and absolutely murdered the pacing in the first half of the movie. 

The action, the dialogue, and the side heroes were all a serious step up from the first movie. While I liked the first one and it gave me a serious early era DP comic feel (my fav Deadpool era), this one felt more like the Deadpool that a majority of comic fans love. Also, the romance chemistry that came out of nowhere as the best part of the first movie was still really good here.

#tl;dr 
It was a very flawed but fun movie that I can't say I was disappointed by. It actually reminded me a lot of Iron Man 2 in its strengths and flaws, but this movie had that one clearly beat on entertainment value. Not as good as the first, but tons of fun and worth a watch. 7/10",8k9ob3

dz6lm6z,"I had some issues with the movie.

* Cable was badass as fuck. Brolin was the perfect actor, his costume was cool, his gun was cool, he had good motivation for what he was doing, and he wasn't even really a villain. BUT I think he was underused and it often felt like the script didn't have anything for him to do. For example, after the convoy crashes and Juggernaut tears Deadpool in half, they just forget all about him and leave. He's lying there in the debris and nobody gives a fuck. They just leave and let him get up and walk away.
* After Cable's first attempt at killing the kid, why doesn't he just return to the prison and do it again? With Deadpool out of the picture he could have easily succeeded. The guards clearly could't stop him.
* There were too many moments where a totally inappropriate song played during a scene for comedic effects. It's not funny anymore. It just undermined what could have been much cooler moments.
* I thought overall it was less funny than the first one. I had some good laughs but the novelty wore off and I was expecting more fun, not more drama.
* Some of the CG looked like crap. 
* I thought the pacing was all over the place and overall it was a bit of a mess.
* With Leitch directing I was hoping for some clear, steadily shot action like John Wick, but here there was quite a bit of fast edits and shaky cam.
* The story was very similar to Looper",8k9ob3

In the hallway when Rusty is chasing down the school headmaster there is a poster on the wall that reads: M-Day is coming!!!

It explains why we dont see Mutants in the MCU after all there are only 198 of them after the events of M-day so its easy to see why they all laid low up to this point in the MCU.

* I was real disappointed we didn't really get that team.
* I was hoping we saw some pouches on Cable and some gags about that (maybe the fanny pack thing was supposed to be that!?). And some backstory for Cable, since he's got a pretty good story. 
* The CGI DID NOT look like it's from a modern movie. Colossus looked awful, as did Juggernaut and Deadpool's baby legs. They should have just used practical effects there, it was really jarring how jelly-like the CGI elements moved.

It wasn't as great as the first one though it did have a few funnier moments like the parachute fiasco, killing Reynolds and X-Men Origins Wade Wilson. 

Domino's luck sequence was pretty neat.

Josh Brolin was great as Cable.

Weasel was straight up boring. Dopinder wasn't funny for very long.

Surprise X-men cameo was hilarious.

Yukio and Deadpool's interactions were pretty amusing.

They could have made sure that Russel never killed the Orphanage Headmaster by doing so themselves and covering it up. Can't kill someone who's already dead.

Juggernaut losing was poppycock. He could have easily torn Deadpool into half again or thrown them all far, far away. Colossus can't even begin to compete with him. That fight should have ended before it even began.

Deadpool ""death scene"" went on for far too long and got exhausting pretty quick.

No one seems to take anything seriously at all. No one seemed to really care that Vanessa died. It was like everyone was just trying to tolerate Wade than actually try to empathise. Even Colossus seemed to care more about making Deadpool be a part of the X-Men than helping him get through the ordeal. It was a pretty fortunate that helping the kid helped him move on.

*The CGI was atrocious
*At no point during that ending was I ever worried that Deadpool was going to die.
*The Juggernaut, although cool, had no buildup and, as someone who is not a comic book fan, I didn’t buy the aura of incredibility that surrounded him.

Edit: welp, that was quick... already with the downvotes for not liking a movie. 

The CGI was pretty terrible far too often. I understand there's budget constraints but it took me out of the movie too often. The scene where Deadpool goes back to court Colossus at the X Mansion sticks out. There's a mirror in the corner of the room that's reflecting Colossus that looks like the stand in from the deleted scenes from the originals. Colossus in general look WAY worse this time around.

It felt overstuffed too. It would've been so much better if they just cut Domino and gave more to Cable. That would also get rid of that terrible part where it shows Domino's powers in the chase scene in slow mo with some of the worst CGI I've seen since Suicide Squad.

It wasnt nearly as funny either. So many of the jokes was in the marketing material. Deadpool's jokes were so fucking predictable and lazy. It seriously felt like they just took lines off Twitter. The only part that felt anywhere near as funny as the first was the mid credit scene.

The most frustrating part of it is the first was a parody. Same with the comics. This movie wasn't. It was bland without being clever about it like the orignal. It was X-Men with characters that say fuck and cunt. ",8k9ob3
dza73ny,"This was not very good IMO. 

I was kind of annoyed that a lot of the jokes they attempted could have been hilarious had they been executed better, instead a lot of it just fell very flat (the X-Men cameo, the X-Force dying off, etc.) The tone, especially in the first half, was all over the place, and the CGI was often quite poor. The story plods along messily until it ends up in a generic third act with a bunch of characters whose big team-up doesn't feel particularly deserved, pitted against a very half-assed cameo villain. The first one had some similar issues but was overall just a tighter and more enjoyable movie.

Don't get me wrong, there were a lot of good jokes, fun scenes, and Domino was a cool character. But other than that, this movie is an unfocused, loud, random, mess! 

* They stole so many jokes from the first movie. I know this is a common trend in sequels, but it just didn't have the same feel telling the same types of stuff the second time around. Quite frankly, it felt lazy and distracting most of the time. Especially the scene where Deadpool is regrowing his legs, they spent so much time having *every* single character focus on it and make tell their one liner it was just distracting more so than funny. 

* Russell Collins sucked. Seriously, you'd think the character who's supposed to motivate the entire story would have you know, some redeeming qualities, but no. There is no reason to care about this child outside one or two flashbacks of the workers being mean to him. There was no reason for Deadpool to become so attached and so willing to risk everything to save him, and no reason for the audience to care. 

* Cable sucked. He wasn't bad, just boring! What's his deal? Why does he have a metal arm? Why is he so proficient with guns? Why does he have time traveling technology? Why are he and future Russell such hardened enemies? All he is the entire movie is just some angry terminator who beats up Deadpool, and then just decides out of nowhere to make peace with them and that they're friends now. This is a character with tons of comic history and they turned him into a walking plot device. 

* The story was phoned in. There was basically no real antagonist of this movie, no really clear defined objectives, very little significant character growth, etc. Wade ends the film right back where he started from the beginning, literally. He already had made a good connection with the X-Men after stopping Ajax, and only slightly lost it, only to regain it again. Bad writing 101. He learned nothing from any of it. It's not even like he's going to try and be a serious X-Men now, he never learns to stop killing which was what got him into trouble in the first place and it's not like his personality is going to go away. 

* Speaking of plot, why is a Deadpool movie suddenly all about family and compassion in the first place!? He's Deadpool, he's a crazy healing psychopath who does random stupid shit because he's bored. There are literally so many other heroes and teams dedicated to exploring literally every single one of these themes and doing it a hundred times better. Just because the character makes a bunch of fourth wall breaks doesn't change the fact that he's being put into boring, lazy, repetitive situations we've seen a million times already in CBMs. 

Deeply disappointed. The first Deadpool was good, in like a Thor or Doctor Strange kind of way. Fun and a good adaptation, but not particularly deep or memorable. This took everything bad about the first one and multiplied while completely forgetting the reason people like this character in this place. 

Seems like I'm in the minority here not liking this, but I want to give my honest feedback and hope Ant-Man and The Wasp is at least a little better

Ryan Reynolds delivered as usual, and there are some truly hilarious moments (X-Force immediately getting fucking destroyed, Deadpool's baby legs), but the film was a little overlong. Compare to Infinity War which combined serious moments and humour and breezed by although being almost an hour longer than this film. It started to drag real hard for me near the end.

Cable was awesome, Josh Brolin is fucking cool. As close to a Tommy Lee Jones or Clint Eastwood type that's around today. It didn't feel like there was enough of him in the film though, and his motivations at the end of the film were nothing. 

Domino just felt shoved in, and didn't really make an impact as a character. I'd rather watch more of Peter, I loved that guy. Watching him sit down on the edge of the plane when they were all jumping was way funnier to me than I think it should have been. Firefist I didn't really care about, and didn't get a reaction from Deadpool throughout the film that he should care about him either.

Overall I had a good laugh, but it's a very busy film, but totally worth it for the post credits scenes.

The first one had me laughing the entire time and it was hilarious the whole time ever time I saw it in theaters (which was 8 total times).

The movie picked up after that for me and I laughed here and there from the jokes but the baby legs part has me rolling easily the funniest part in the entire movie. 

Brolin killed it as cable. I kept saying destiny still arrives every time he would talk. Anyways, he was great and portrayed cable perfectly. Also, fuck he is a ripped for like a 60 year old.

The juggernaut was god awful in this. His jokes fell flat except of course the sun is getting real low one which of course was Deadpool’s line but anyway. The CGI was awful and come on colossus even putting up a fight against him was bullshit. No way colossus fights evenly with him ever (of course I’m not talking about when colossus became the new juggernaut but just base form).

It was amusing more than it was genuinely funny for me. There's lots of fun to be had here but it's the same humour and same kinds of jokes as the first one for better or worse. And it doesn't feel like it's trying particularly hard to do anything meaningful. 

My biggest complaint, I'd guess, is that the movie devoted a lot of time to some really cliched story and plot points purely for the sake of subverting them. But it's still devoted a lot of time to these moments which ultimately feels like time wasted. It also doesn't help when it wants a serious moment to resonate when it's been farting in the face of serious moments throughout the whole film. 

Juggernaut was fun, Josh Brolin was great as Cable, Domino was a highlight, Julian Dennison was good, and Reynolds still nails Deadpool, but the movie itself is pretty messy and the humour is hit or miss. ",8k9ob3

dz607sl,"Ok so I LOVED the movie. It was funny as hell, original plot line, and surprisingly emotional. I thought it was smart for Vanessa to die and they made it quite touching that she knew it ""wasn't their time yet."" I thought the ending created a great storyline for the next movie. Cable is here to stay, the team is great, and maybe even a romance between Domino and Deadpool (speculating here). 

But then the mid-credits scene happened. And I'm really scared it may have ruined the movie for me. Fixing the time watch (?) took away all of the progress made in the movie. Vanessa's death was necessary and handled properly. It opened a lot of doors. Cable giving his life with his family to stay around added emotion and sacrifice hardly seen in Marvel movies. But then it was all basically reversed. Vanessa lives, there's a working time machine watch and, if Cable ever discovers this knowledge (Deadpool said he wouldn't let him know about it) he can time travel back to his family. 

Although this move allowed for a ton of humor to be added, it took away the sacrifice that I felt separated this movie from other Marvel movies. Marvel seems to almost always have this ""everything works out in the end and no one really loses that much"" theme. I personally hate this ever-recurrent storyline but that's a subjective viewpoint. I was really glad to see some real loss, emotion, growth, and creation in this movie and then it was taken away. 
So this raises a lot of questions for me: if Vanessa lives didn't that basically remove a major part of the plot? If Vanessa lived why would Deadpool have ever joined the X-Men again? If he didn't join the X-Men he would not have ever met Russel (I think that's his name not totally sure). Did Cable really sacrifice anything now that the watch works again? Did bringing back Vanessa and fixing the watch basically ruin this movie? I loved it up until that point. I honestly hope that the next movie comes out and we find out it was actually a dream or some cliche thing and that Vanessa is actually dead and the watch is broken. I felt this mid-credits scene, though hilarious, took away a lot of the ground the movie made and ruined some potential creative plot points. And I just want to say I was sad that Vanessa died but it added emotionality and made this movie more unique than it already is. Without destruction (Vanessa's death), they're cannot be creation (the rest of the movie). 

Feel free to comment please! I'd love to hear what other people thought of this move and if there's theories on why they did it.

dz6dcl4,"What a great movie, I have been a big fan of the Deadpool character for quite a while and these movies just get him perfectly, Ryan Reynolds was born to play this role, I definitely think he might be the absolute best casting in superhero movie history.

When I initially heard the film had more fourth wall breaking and references I was worried, overuse of those is part of what makes Way's run on Deadpool so bad but they weren't a problem at all, they were really funny and made sense in context rather than just for the sake of it for the most part.

Domino and Cable were so good, Their banter with Deadpool was great and man, Josh Brolin is having such a good month, first he does Thanos so well and now Cable, man if you had told me back during X Men Origins that this film would sort of lead (with the help of test footage leaked by someone who definitely wasn't Ryan Reynolds or anything) to us getting the perfect Deadpool,Cable and Domimo I probably would've called you insane but you would've been right.

That X Force parachuting out the plane scene was the hardest I've laughed in a long time, Glad DP used the time travel device to save Peter though, Hope we see him in X Force or Deadpool 3.

Also the post credits scenes were easily the best I've ever seen, Each one was funnier than the last from Negasonic Teenage Warhead's ""what have I done"" (When Negasonic Teenage Warhead grows up is she going to become Negasonic Adult Warhead or just Negasonic Warhead? I also thought her relationship with Yukio was nice and Yukio's constant ""Hi Wade"" whenever he appeared was pretty funny) to Deadpool killing Ryan Reynolds, just great.

But it wasn't just good comedy I really liked the plot of this one too, like the best Deadpool runs it showed us his inner pain, in large part due to Vanessa's death. His heart to hearts with Russell were great, I particularly liked him trying to not get him to kill, His scene with Russell where he finds out they are abusing him then repeating Colossus's speech then killing one of the Abusers was excellent, I really liked that they didn't make Wade this complete unlikeable psychopath instead This film got Deadpool right, it didn't borrow from Way's abomination of a run it borrowed from Joe Kelly as all good DP adaptations should.

My absolute favourite moment in the movie though was Cable kissing his daughter's teddy bear knowing he would never get to see his family alive, just great. You could see the pain on Brolin's face as he decided to save Wade instead.

They was also the fantastic final scene not including post credits of Wade and Vanessa in heaven before Cable rewrote time, Really nice moment. This film had genuine heart and I really liked that. I've said before that I prefer the best Fox films (DOFP, First Class, X2, Logan and the two Deadpools) over the majority of MCU films (Winter Soldier and maybe Infinity War being the two exceptions, though I still like Logan and DOFP more) because the Fox films have genuine emotion, heart that the majority of the MCU lacks.

I still really like most of the MCU films but I still feel like they lack the heart these movies have, even Apocalypse as shit as it was had the great Magneto scenes with his family, I've criticised Thor Ragnarok especially (very funny movie though) for not knowing when to be a comedy and when to be serious, negating the consequences of the film (though the Russos thankfully included a scene of Thor showing emotion over the events in Infinity War) and I've seen people use the defence that Ragnarok was a comedy, It was but so are these Deadpool movies and they still know when to be funny snd when to show emotion, It just makes the film's events carry some weight.

Overall while not every joke landed I Deadpool 2 was a fantastic time at the theatre and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has any interest in the character.

P.S loved the Liefeld joke ""like some asshole who couldn't draw feet""",8k9ob3

dzb191n,"I don't think this is a bad movie by any means. But it is NOTICEABLY worse than the first. Which, in today's age of movie making, is usually the norm. And I know it is unfair to compare a sequel to the original.

But this movie just doesn't have the excitement or even the heart like the first. I think because Ryan and the rest of the filmmakers poured their heart & soul in the first movie it really showed on screen. While this sequel isn't bad, it just feels like a generic action blockbuster more than anything else.

There was some good jokes here but, like a Deadpool comic, it becomes to frequent that a lot don't land for me. Some of the action in this is fun but a lot of it doesn't feel as eventful as the first movie. That and the CGI in this film is REMARKABLY terrible. I know this isn't Infinity War but it got practically doubt its budget; so the CG in this should not be as terrible as it is. It got to the point where I was laughing more at the bad CGI than any of the jokes.

I know this post is incredibly negative but like I said in the beginning I think this movie is decent enough to be watchable. The casting in this is pretty darn good and I think it is what saves the movie. Reynolds is still great as Deadpool so no shock there. But Brolin is pretty good too as Cable even if it is, mostly, a tough man role. But the breakout star for me was Zazie Beetz as Domino. She got some of the best jokes, got the best use of her powers, and was just a joy to see on screen. I hope she actually gets her own movie but I'll be happy to see her in whatever the next project is.

As you can tell I am a bit torn with this movie as a whole. It's not a bad movie and I still had fun with it. But it just doesn't have the magic that the first movie did. I still think it is better than ***most*** comic book movies out so you will still probably enjoy yourself.",8k9ob3

In this one, felt the humor was a bit forced.  And the self-depricating humor pulled me out a couple of times.  The line before the Juggernaut/Colossus fight, for example, was unnecessary and detracted from a pretty epic fight.

But my biggest issue was the first act.  It was too depressing and a downer.  Took too long to get fun and funny.  When it did get going, though, it really gets going.  The sky-dive scene onward was a fantastic movie, which unfortunately was pretty much half-way through.

I'm sure we could've gotten plenty of character development / heroes journey moments without the movie pumping the breaks at every yellow light.  Yes Wade could've been motivated by [indirectly causing Vanessa's death,](#spoiler) but in a comedy of this calibre it didn't need to be such a dream-like dramatic moment. Sure, he could've hit his lowest point by [being de-powered and placed in Mutant jail,](#spoiler) but it didn't have to be such a darkest hour trope where he stopped cracking jokes.  

And don't get me started on the ending. What a bunch of misfires. [He wants to die, but cracks jokes, but then gives a message of hope, then cracks jokes, then he can dream Vanessa again, and then crack jokes...](#spoiler) I didn't know whether to laugh or not. I actually heard some people in my audience give a ""Ha?"" aloud.  
And the superhero moral of this story comes copy-pasted right out of **Looper**; how better influence could set somebodies potential in life down a better, more optimistic path. And even then, it's execution is muddled and misses the mark.  

Josh Brolin feels pretty wasted / sidelined as the classic character Cable. He's essentially just a heel-face turn version of Kyle Reese, but with a less fleshed out backstory so we don't really care.  

And that CGI - What happened!? We all know 20th Century Fox were being cheap with Deadpool 1, but they more than doubled the budget here and the CGI just isn't showing it. Colossus looks nearly the same as before, and [the Juggernaut](#spoiler) (although he finally looks like his comic book design) just doesn't cut it here. Maybe I'm wrong in assuming X times the budget means X times the special effects quality.  

Also I've got to mention one of Deadpool's quips while he was being a trainee - that X-Men is just a outdated metaphor for racism in the 1960's. I think that waaaaaaay over-simplifies / generalizes it.  Just like zombie shows (The Walking Dead, 28 Days Later, etc), X-Men's mutants have been an ongoing and ever-relevant metaphor for more than just racism (Just look at FX's Legion's take on Mental Health) for decades.  

Also also, we get it already with the Green Lantern jokes Ryan Reynolds - yeesh.  

All that being said, Deadpool 2 is still a very fun movie and on par with the first. If anything, I'd say this one is far more rewatchable.",8k9ob3

But holy damn. It was great. Loved the beginning with the Logan reference. Loved all the references, really. I get that they pulled some people out of the movie.. I thought they were great.

I give this like a 75-80% on my ""hell yeah this was a fun movie"" scale. Perfect? Nah. But just a joy to watch? For sure. I'd say the first one was 85-90%. ",8k9ob3

dz7ia4g,"There's a two-screen theater in my town that played this a day early for only $5, so it was completely packed. We got there kind of late, so we had to sit in the back, and it was hard to concentrate for the first 20 minutes to half hour, but eventually it was easier to get into. It's a pretty fun experience with that many people clapping and laughing and everything, but the trad-offs are, well, obvious. 

Some guy in our row kept wobbling the entire line of seats, since we were on a relatively short row at the edge, and it seemed like the only area with open seats and they are all connected it seems. None of this is the movie's fault, but that's what made it hard to concentrate for a while, so I definitely want to see this again sooner or later. 

Overall, the CGI was pretty bad in some places, good in others, and the jokes ranged from okay to really good, but mostly they were great. If nothing else, the shoddy CGI knocks it down a peg, and sometimes, but rarely, the jokes seemed somewhat repetitive (musical gags, but some of them were great.)  

I really liked it. My opinion will change in time, from reading more perspectives and seeing it again, I'm sure, but I think it's an 8.5-9/10. ",8k9ob3

mind you i've never seen the first part or a marvel movie before, and i'm not hating on the movie; i found it really funny and entertaining, it was funny enough to make up for having to suffer through all the violence.

dza4eec,Didnt enjoy this one as much as i did the first one thats for sure. Ive watch the first one 8 times and still find it enjoyble im not sure i can watch this second one more that 2 times. The first act is so slow i was wondering when we'll get more DP there was to much testicular Ryan scenes and to little full costumed DP. The souldtrack even tho full of good songs  was sometimes missplaced(the dubstep jokes where shit imo) And 80% of the cgi is literally garbage... they relied to much on it thinking they the bigger budget can cut it while the first movie knew its budget limits and played around that using much less cgi. And i hated the charecter of cable here... nothing close to the comics version imo and it kinda didnt fit well with me.,8k9ob3
dzb2kg5,This movie was funny but there were a lot of try-hard moments,8k9ob3
dzfaftw,"I thought it was decent. Not quite as good as I wanted it to be but still fun. The plot structure seemed a bit all over the place and relied too much on magical dreams to establish motivation. 

I also thought NTW (and her gf) was wasted in this, while the relationship with firefist and dp seemed shallow. I think the movie could have been a tighter package if NTW somehow played the role firefist plays. 

And this is probably just me being a softy but Deadpool not giving a shit about all the new x-force guys dying because of him made it hard for me to root for him in his own life struggles. (I get that whole scene was played for laughs and dp isn’t supposed to be a real hero, but I dunno, still made everything feel less meaningful.) At least he saved Peter in the end but by then the movie was over. 

Final note; isn’t Domino the most powerful being alive? Seems like her powers are basically god-tier and she doesn’t even have to try. Does she have a weakness in the comics? 

Donino was great btw. ",8k9ob3

So here goes:
The Avengers set photos include scenes from past avengers films, and they have these devices on their wrist. I saw Deadpool 2 and does anyone else see the massive similarities between their devices and Cables time-travel device? So could they use this device to reclaim the infinity stones throughout time, and create a new infinity gauntlet? And also does this mean Deadpool might have a connection to infinity war, cause I know deadpool won't be fully in it cause of the age ratings of the two films, but this seems pretty cool! ",8k9ob3

dz63p7h,"Did DP save the rest of X-Force, or just Peter?

I wish we'd gotten to see more of the future Cable traveled from, and I was really hoping to see a sentinel. Oh well.

I really love what they did with Colossus (to butcher the line, ""this is how we do it in Russia""), but I wish we'd had more Negasonic. I was really hoping to see more of Brianna Hildebrand's acting chops, but it felt like she got less screen time than the first movie. Her GF was a nice touch, particularly with how their personalities were contrasted, but it seemed mildly distracting.

There were a few sequences that simply went on for too long. The whole baby legs joke and the DP death scene were excessive to the point of unfunny. Shoehorning the Basic Instinct bit in there was mildly amusing, but I don't think it was amusing enough to justify the entire sequence.

I'll just say it: Leitch nearly ruined the movie by casting Julian Dennison. Sure, he had a moment, maybe a moment and a half, but overall he was the weakest part of the film, and since he was one of the two main emotional centers, he was nearly a disaster. I understand he's only, what, 15? It isn't his fault, it's the fault of the director/casting director, but he can barely act compared to the rest of cast. His lines were *painfully* and noticeably repetitive and often poorly delivered.

The bit where Wade crossed into the afterlife with Vanessa and reverted to his former self was genuinely touching to some degree, which is impressive.

I'll probably see it again over the weekend. My initial showing was ruined to some extent because of some idiot parent who brought her kids, who were maybe 10 and 7, and I was stuck sitting next to them. They couldn't sit still, they couldn't shut up, they laughed constantly at everything even when it wasn't a joke, and they kept rocking around in their seats which shook the entire row.

tl;dr: awesome movie, but leave your younger-than-13 crotch fruit at home; intentionally taking them to a movie like this should be considered a form of child abuse, and you're a terrible person for subjecting the rest of us to them",8k9ob3
dz65zf8,"I never got into any of the comics...that's why I based what this movie was going to be about, and my then disappointment on the trailer...which usually gives you a rough idea what the movie is going to be about. The trailer went left, the movie went right. 

You can compare the movies when Deadpool 1 has been right in the mix of all the amazing Marvel (I know) movies that have been coming out for years. Deadpool 1 is in my top 5 comic book movies of all time. It's like 2 or 3. So I expected the sequel to be on par with the first. So infinity War is number 1, Deadpool being number 2 and Deadpool 2 would maybe round out a top 10 or so

Again not saying it was terrible. Just didn't captivate me like the first did. Was still enjoyable and worth the price of admission. We're in a day and age where everything is extreme. If someone criticizes something, it means they hate everything about it. ",8k9ob3

dz7g2b9,"The movie was fine overall but I was really unimpressed with the action, especially give the director. A lot of it felt choppy and unintelligible. Maybe David Leitch just isn’t used to working with CG action. A lot of the plot and motivation was also a little directionless. I wish Deadpool’s motivation for specifically wanting to save Fire Fist was a little stronger and the ending to Cable’s story was awful. When he made a comment about something happening back in the first act I was a little confused because the first act was over and I still had no idea where the story was going. Still, plenty of fun and laughs. Naturally it doesn’t have to originality the first did so it ends up feeling a bit like a generic superhero film. ",8k9ob3

Deadpool got over his GF's death too quick too it felt like, I know it's not supposed to be a sob story but it felt like her death barely had any weight to it. 
I thought they could've gotten a lot more mileage out of Terry Crews as well. He died without doing anything but I guess that was the joke. Feels like wasted potential. 
Negasonic teenage warhead didn't do anything either, she was just there. That goes double for her girlfriend, she was there for the one joke which wasn't that funny to begin with.

Cable was really fun too, but he could've been explored more as a character. Maybe im nerding out, but in the comics he has a major nemesis named Stryfe, who's an exact replica evil version of him and created by the big bad from another X-men movie, Apocalypse. So there could've been lot of fourth wall breaking jokes about how a blue old man who's really Oscar Isaac, gave birth to another version of Cable. Cable and Deadpool could've battled Stryfe (who could've been played by Josh Brolin also) in the end. And what more , that kid could've actually meant to grow up to become Stryfe, because of which Cable traveled back in time the first place.      

So overall the movie itself was an awesome in your gut, action comedy, but had a lot of unresolved scope for more. Also the way the writers carelessly murdered X-Force WAS FUCKING HILARIOUS.",8k9ob3

Those who go and watch it because it's trending; these people will enjoy the jokes as they are because the situation. (not trying to insult here) 

Those who know a little about everything that's happening in the USA, from social debates like cultural appropriation and gender neutral nouns, to comics related arguments (movies as well, the post-credit scenes killed me). These ones will get most out of the film.

One thing I didn't like is the lack of a song to ""represent"" the movie, like in Deadpool 1.

dzawtvc,Hey anyone get the vibe that Deadpool 2 takes place in the 1980s. Reason I say that is because when Cable is searching time he shows Pres. Regan and then shows the X plane flying in to deal with the kid version that kills his family. Also shows the version of the X men who will be in Dark Phoenix. I know this sounds crazy but I’m just wondering. Maybe this is why they are doing the reshoots to bring in Cable and or Deadpool for help?  I know probably a dumb idea but didn’t know why Regan popped up instead of Trump or Obama or hell Bush. Found it odd they showed the 80s. ,8k9ob3

Is this going to catch on?

Anyway, after the X-verse and the MCU merges, (if Disney is confident enough to keep DP) I reckon Vanessa's appearance would be a fine interpretation of Lady Death, since Death's interaction is fairly limited to Thanos and DP, and I think audiences will accept a romance with Vanessa's appearance better than a skeleton.

Also I'm hoping they'll adapt the Thanos vs DP story in DP3, after X-force that is. Go crazy cosmic, Eternity kidnaps Death, death as Vanessa appears in DP's dream, (use like a Zen / Karmic explanation, say when ppl die, they become a part of death, therefore Technically Vanessa is Death) Eternity manifest physically and we get a peek at the Cosmic Entities. DP becomes Captain Universe, aka Captain Deadpool! Oh man it'll be awesome!!!

2) The trailer made it seem like a totally different movie. I can't stand when trailers make you think a movie is about one thing, you get your hopes up, then it's something different. I was looking forward to Cable vs Deadpool. Not let's team up to protect this annoying kid with anger issues.

3) I feel like there was too much mask-less Deadpool in this

1) Juggernaut was awesome.

The heart of the movie isn't there (and all that stuff about Ricky Baker playing mutant Ricky Baker doesn't work, they don't use the boy's charm), the CGI is bad, the action is hit or miss, and some jokes are edited so fast that you barely notice them, or go on for as long as you can beat a dead horse.

[So they kill off four actual members of the X-Force team in this film as a joke.

Shatterstar was the deadliest fighter on the team roster for a while. Also Peter was being shown to actually have a purpose in the trailer and he dies because Zeitgeist spews acid vomit on him. Also Vanisher is just a better version of Nightcrawler that can teleport across the world by just thinking about the location; no idea why they deciding to make him an invisible Brad Pitt.

I personally enjoyed it but do like the first one more. I didn’t like how Wade visits Vanessa and then ultimately reunites with her until she tells him to go back. Sorry but that’s just cheesy, I did like that they killed her off though as I am not a fan of the actress at all and while initially seeing the first film I wished someone else got the role, so it was great to see so little of her in this. 

I didn’t like the kid. At all. Sorry but I thought he was awful throughout the entire film until the final scene. 

The jokes fell pretty flat in my theater until X-Force shows up and then they all die. Lmao. 

Domino was awesome in this. Was shocked how much I like her. 

The whole Colossus and Wade friendship felt too forced in this. 

My biggest gripe is the editing in this. I felt it was very sloppy at moments, especially in the early Cable scenes. This was easily my biggest issue.

dzmpt8k,"I liked the movie, but one part left me unsatisfied. The X-Force skydiving scene. I get the joke is that the audience isn’t expecting the entire team (who was featured heavily in marketing) to die, but I felt it was sudden, overly gruesome and left a bad taste in my mouth. When thinking about it, I feel they could have changed it so it was more palatable to the audience, without changing a lot.

So the team is skydiving in, and the wind advisory blows everyone except Domino off course. You can still keep the original joke of reality ensues, so someone still gruesomely dies. Deadpool hits the billboard, Shatterstar hits the helicopter, he can keep his joke about not being better at something. Bedlam crash lands, but doesn’t die. Lets just say he breaks both of his legs or something. Maybe DP can make a quip about his regenerative factor, ask him if he’s still ready to go. An ambulance can show up form him. Zeitgeist can land (somewhat safely), but maybe you have a joke about him getting nauseous and vomiting his acid spit everywhere. Peter lands safely, and Vanisher lands safely and takes off the harness. He will not be seen for the rest of the film, and you can have multiple more jokes about whether or not he is there. So now you’ve got DP, Vanisher, Peter, and maybe Zeitgeist going to catch up to the convoy. If Zeitgeist comes, you can have Cable kill him with little effort. After Russell and Juggernaut get away, you can have Peter (who has somehow survived the fight, maybe he has been shot non lethally) want to stay and help DP, and DP has to be reasonable and tell him its not safe for him to be there, reversing the earlier conversation they had on the helicopter about Peter wanting to leave and DP promising to keep him safe and adding some depth to their relationship. So X-Force is still removed for the rest of the movie, and maybe at the end Vanisher appears and there is a joke about him being there the whole time and then he’s run over by Dopinder or something.

There, now the X-Force/convoy scene is not as horrific because not everyone dies all at once, you don’t have to use time travel to save Peter, and you don’t make a joke out of people’s deaths in a movie where the plot and motivations are primarily urged on by death.",8k9ob3

dz8wumn,"I'd have a hard time recommending it without major caveats

Sure, it had some funny jokes \- had some really cringy jokes as well. The entire first 15 minutes are virtually unwatchable imo. Just garbage action.  It's amazing you can make deadpool killing thugs legitimately boring as shit.

Then the main plot driver just totally erases everything from the first movie. I had when films do this. Flash back to alien 3 \- oh hey we crashed newt is dead now. . .  ugh. But why?

Then it's like ""oh you guys liked deadpool 1 it made money \- lets just re\-make it and call it a sequel""

we get stupid ass colossus jokes. The colossus character from the comic is not remotely like this colossus character .this colossus character is absolute horse shit.

We get more mega sonic teenage warhead or whatever .Because of course, she was in the first movie \- gotta be featured here.

we get the legit exact same joke again ""oh i lost some limbs and now they are back but they are small is this not hilarious?

Why do they have to do this ? Why \- while watching a sequel \- must I constantly be reminded I share a planet w/ idiots who enjoy this type of ""member when this exact same thing happened last time. I member""  film making.

And lets talk about Cable. Aside from looking like cable and using a gun \- how is this character related to the comic book cable? He isn't. It's just like the movie World War Z. They just wanted to use the name and the look and feel to make people think they are getting some reference to a real character, but this is just a totally generic ""I'm from the future and my family died"" revenge character. Nothing remotely related to Cable in any way. They don't even MENTION that he's cyclops and jean grey's kid!!

In addition \- a major plot point of this movie is that juggernaut is being kept in a cell.

That just makes no fucking sense. If you know the literal only one thing there is to know about the character Juggernaut \- how is he being kept in a cell in a prison?",8k9ob3

You come to threads like these a day or two after the movie drops, and every single top comment contains a reference or at least one use of the word ""fuck."" I'm not against using the word, but all it shows in every single movie discussion is *how hyperbolic you people are.*

I knew that I'd come to this thread and see this. This is reddit. This movie is made for you people. There's references galore (which redditors *love* to repeat as if we haven't seen the movie) and you use expletives in the place of actual critical analysis.

This movie isn't the second coming of Christ. No movie is the second coming of Christ. You may feel that way the moment you drag your ass out of the theatre, but let it actually manifest in your mind before you spout off surface level comments. This is a *discussion,* not a place to type a quote and drown in upvotes by people who have the same attention span you do. Your recency bias sucks.

dzglc2v,"Subversive yet safe and dull.

Anyone notice how they just casually slipped 'molester' in with the description of the headmaster?  First he was an abuser then they just started calling him and the other guys there (all white) molesters.  Why?  There was no context for this whatsoever.

Remember the scene where DP asks Colossus for forgiveness and help? Did you notice that sort of hard cut from him saying he was a dick and all about how dicks are bad and do nothing but cause problems - straight to the two lesbians and flowering them with approval?  It's a hit you over the head message 'Vagina good, Penis bad'.  

You see shots don't just pop into movies.  It takes sometimes a third or even half a day to shoot a 3 second scene.  You have to set up the camera(s), lighting and sound equipment.  Then test it then finally shoot several takes, and then break down said equipment and move it to the next shot.  Think about that one shot of negasonic and her gf.  Can you easily integrate it into the larger scene in any meaningful way?  By meaningful I mean worth the 10 to 20 thousand dollars the shot might've cost them?  Does it not just stand out as remarkably unnecessary?  Was it entertaining in it's own right?  

And what was with the 'Oh no so many old white men on my wall, I better grab my rape whistle' joke?  At best it seemed to me to be an almost mocking of sjws but I *know* they weren't the butt of the joke.  I just find it hard to believe that that joke would work enough to put in the movie.  But I guess no matter the old white man, whether (or especially because) he's worthy of a portrait he's a rapist.  

I get the deadpool humor.  It's edgy, or supposed to be.  So I know walking in that I'm gonna need to thicken my skin a bit.  I have no right to expect to enjoy the character if I'm not prepared to take some jabs, it's gonna come with the territory.  But this is the most tame, riskless, *dickless*, and safe movie ever.  Instead of being a chaotic maverick he's the perfect example of an obedient, obsequious and house broken beta boy.  He's a true social justice warrior.

Deadpool is not funny at all  nobody is. Everything is either a marvel reference or some joke about racism is bad. That's literally all you're gonna hear this whole movie.That's like 75% of the dialouge and I'm barely exaggerating.

dz644ou,Dude I wanted that line so bad.  I was so disappointed he never said it.   ,8k9ob3
dzaj7yv,And they acknowledge him as being Xavier's brother in this one.,8k9ob3
dz8cqhq,Was it a cameo? I would say he was a full blown character. He played an important part in moving the plot along. Helping the little fat kid & whatnot. ,8k9ob3

Didn't expect him to seem like such a punk-stylish character too, which was great. Then...well. And I also really wanted to see Shatterstar on the big screen. So much for that. Their deaths earned some well deserved laughter from our audience though, probably the loudest ones in the movie, along with ''what the fuck!''s all around. 

I guess Shatterstar did get his turn on the big screen. You might say he is, in fact, splattered all over it. The green blood was a nice touch.",8k9ob3

dz6ahoy,"Was I the only one that was legit kinda ""freaked out"" about it? The only reason I can think of why was because I never have to, like, prepare myself to see deaths that brutal or all the suspense before each of their deaths in a superhero movie. I'm expecting it in a horror movie. Like, if that calibre of death happened in Infinity War, I'd shit myself. ",8k9ob3

dz65wyd,Yep.  He’s definitely awake.,8k9ob3
dz68mpe,He was climbing out of the swimming pool right before the cut to credits. ,8k9ob3

Plus I’m glad they saved the Vanisher joke for the movie instead of wasting it in the trailer. ",8k9ob3
dz6bz6j,And with the X-Force spinoff already announced you'd figure they *have* to survive! That was a great bait and switch.,8k9ob3

dz68hqy,I hadn't watched any trailers so seeing Ricky Baker with flame thrower hands was a real neat surprise!,8k9ob3
dz84483,I guessed Juggernaut would be in the movie because of Black Tom Cassidy. Turned out to be true but they never meet and Black Tom dies... is there a name for that kind of coincidental guessing?,8k9ob3

They learned from BvS",8k9ob3
dz7q9co,The whole arm green screne scene was not in the movie. They did a really good job with the trailers to say the least. ,8k9ob3
dz7019r,Yes because I was avoiding trailers..but one was shown when I was out supporting someone to see another film.. I couldn't avoid it..it was great that it didn't spoil much...it just made the bullet katana scene and x force funnier!,8k9ob3
dz9bq5y,That's why I avoid movie trailers as much as possible. ,8k9ob3
dznde2n,Just stop watching trailers to movies you know you'll see. ,8k9ob3

dz9oee1,I'm pretty sure it was an ambulance?,8k9ob3

But I was happy when he killed the fucker anyway.",8k9ob3

Seriously, then he tried to make sure they both died and the person he wanted dead the most survived.",8k9ob3

Although once they introduce Black Tom Cassidy and then said that the biggest inmate was locked away downstairs and about obvious foreshadowing I knew it was gonna be Juggs. 

Also way to save the Vanisher joke for the movie and not waste it in the trailer. ",8k9ob3

I think that leads to a lot of underwhelmed and disappointed viewers when they've already seen the big shots.

I had no idea Hulk was in Ragnarok and it was awesome when he burst out. I had no idea the X-Force was even a thing in this film so I didn't even know there was a lot of expectations for them, like my friend who did watch the trailers said afterwards. 
So in a way I kind of missed that joke, but I also had no idea the film was about a kid or that Cable was a good guy and part of the team, so all of these things were huge twists and turns for me, every film is a mystery. 

The Infinity War trailer was literally the entire film, it gave away every reveal and location.

Like, X-force all dying in the parachute scene is regular luck considering the whole wind thing and for her, it’s lucky she made it out of that unscathed.

I mean your explanation makes total sense and is kinda cooler, but that seems more magical than mutant and I already have problems dealing with a lot of X-men characters’ powers being more magic than actual mutations.",8k9ob3

This story was weird because it developed much slower than the viewer connects everything together which made for weird pacing, and character motivations that didn't really fit. The movie spent WAAAAAY too much time pretending Cable was the bad guy when it went out of its way to show the audience that he's not from his very first appearance.

No!  Cable clearly shows how the time-travel works.  When he 'rewinds', he still remembers everything that happened so he can slip the token where it needs to go, but still execute everything again exactly the same.

So even though Deadpool goes back and saves Vanessa, that would still leave Russell and the orphans in the hands of the pervert.

At the very least I thought Wade or Cable would have just killed the head of the orphanage since he was clearly abusive to the kids and they had no problem killing his wards. So why not him also? ,8k9ob3

Logan was also coincidentally the last movie we watched together, and ""our song"" was Careless Whisper. He would make so many deadpool references throughout our relationship. That opening scene was like a punch to the gut. I was laughing and crying at the same time. 

My ex also tried committing suicide after I left him, so I was rolling my eyes at seeing Deadpool going in front of a bus. He tried jumping in traffic too when I left him. 

My ex is basically a shittier abusive version of Deadpool. ",8k9ob3

dz82hh6,"The CGI all around was really bad. Loved the movie, though. ",8k9ob3
dz82r2y,"It was bad but it certainly did not look worse than DP1, it was improved if anything. Maybe it was just so low-res in DP1 that it looked better just because you could tell they weren't even trying, if you get what I mean. Here it seemed like they were trying with better lighting/reflective effects but failed.",8k9ob3
dz889gj,I mean even if Vanessa ended up being alive he still had to save Russell from Cable. There's still a whole lot of middle stuff that can't be explained (like how her dying led him to this point) but it's a Deadpool movie so I kind of just accepted it.,8k9ob3

There's also an X-Men story where the original X-Men (60s) are brought to present day by Beast to show present day Scott Summers what a cunt he's being. The Deadpool timeline is probably not meant to make any sense, but that's one way to patch it.",8k9ob3

dzu9tn6,"Peter's alive, but not a ""member of X-Force"" in any meaningful sense, is he? No powers or exciting background. I don't think he was even based on the comics. I'm not familiar with Deadpool and X-Force specifically but I've read a lot of X-Men comics. This universe already has Piotr Rasputin and Pietro Maximoff, and that guy didn't look like Peter Wisdom to me.

Vanisher parachuted into live wires and got electrocuted. Deadpool and some other characters would have survived that, but there's no reason to expect Vanisher to survive it. 

Bedlam could be alive. I don't remember how graphic his accident was. However, he could be dead, and if alive he's probably seriously injured and the character doesn't have a healing factor. Maybe he'll have a cameo or even banter a bit but he probably won't be jumping out of a plane again. Also, as characters from the comics go, he's relatively minor. Deadpool and Cable are major characters. Domino and Shatterstar aren't as big but they've still been on many teams, are fairly important to the X-Men universe, and are fairly unique. Bedlam, however, isn't. Never on a major team or key to a major event, often completely in limbo. No one out there was looking forward to the cinematic adaptation of a major Bedlam story. 

Let's put it this way, the odds of him being a major character in the sequel are less than 10 percent. ",8k9ob3

Bedlam could tho.

I literally just left the theater, so I'm probably still riding the buzz, but I enjoyed DP2 more simply because it did something new. DP1 was fantastic, but it was a parody of the superhero films from the 2000s and early 2010s. DP2 instead did its own thing, expanding upon the characters and world in a new way instead of, say, just trying to parody the Avengers or something.",8k9ob3

A) The prejudice angle works better if you don't have a bunch of other heroes.   
Raising the question why aren't they doing something about this.  

B) It means there are too many superpowered people in the MCU.    
I mean imagine if every gay or black person in Avengers 1 had superpowers.     
There is a ridiculous amour of characters in the X-Men comics because the mutants are essentially there own race. 
That's fine and there's a lot of stories you can tell in that world .... But you can't tell stories like Spiderman in that world. 

C) You can do more stuff if they're on there own.   
I can't really imagine shows like Legion or The Gifted I'm the MCU if I'm honest. (The latter refers back to A).      
Or even movies like Logan or Deadpool.

I think something people either are overlooking or they just can't put themselves in a place to 'unsee' the first one is that there isn't the hype and thrill of having nothing before DP1 whereas now with DP2 there's huge expectations.  And that is why I think a lot of people (not including you necessarily here) are saying this isn't as good as the first.  Whereas i'd argue it is, at least, as good as the first and perhaps even better considering it's getting such good reviews (especially for a second film - when compared to Thor or Iron-Man or Avengers 2 | noting that Captain America 2 was one of the few that was outstanding compared to its first).

But I could be wrong.  I am only going off my account and how blown away I was by the first which made me love it.  That couldn't be with this one but i'm still quite surprised at how damn well they did for a second film.  It's impressive and relieving to know it was done well. ",8k9ob3

I think the villain of IW was far more motivated, understood, and more terrifying than Cable, Fire Fist, or The Juggernaut. 

It's really not all that fair of a comparison, to be quite honest. IW had a massive budget, 10 years of prequels, and a litany of well known characters to play off of. Deadpool had one movie and like, 3 characters to work with. The rest were fresh faces.

You said things kept going on for too long, but the x force thing took up no longer than 10 mins in it's entirety and was completely unexpected (no one saw that coming). A majority of the baby leg scene had the camera focused on him above the waist. The action and dialogue was much closer to what you saw in the comics (as in Deadpool using his body recklessly because of his healing power). Personally, I lost some hype for the movie because I went in to comparing it to what infinity war turned out to be, but winded winded up being more and more excited for the movie as it went on.

dz6cc7w,"I mostly agree

First act was really slow

Loved Juggernaut's introductiom, but his CGI was terrible. Like a big, rubbery man instead of ""unstoppable juggernaut"". I'd take X3 Juggy over this one.

Domino was fucking great.

Really hated all the build up of the recruitment process, only to murder them literally in the very next scene (though was that Brad Pitt as Vanisher?).

Enjoyed the idea behind the intro, but felt the execution was lacking

And the general storyline was weak, imo",8k9ob3
dzeyiwd,"I feel like the bad cgi was almost on purpose? Like when the jet ludicrously lands near the institution. Maybe other instances weren't purposeful, but the Jet definitely felt purposeful. Like another budget joke.  
  
Also, the inclusion of Negasonic and Yukio I felt was a mix of a few different jokes. First, inclusion of characters from the first is sort of another budget joke. The mansion is empty except for 3 Xmen lol  
And then the contrast of negasonic and yukio's personalities, and the recurring interaction between Yukio and Mr. Pool.  
  
Also, I highly disagree that the antagonists were LESS developed than Deadpool1. Francis had very little characterization, whereas we learned about Russel's (the pseudo antagonist sort of) experiences that fueled his hate for the institution and its headmaster (the real villain). We also get a lot of characterization for Russell from Cable and his experiences in the future, and all the experiences throughout with Russell. Then we get lighter characterization of the headmaster when he seems to use a mix of religion and something else as an excuse to hate the mutants. It seemed most likely that a mutant had harmed him or his family in the past.  
But there was LOADS more characterization. I agree that the Wade/Russell dynamic and situation was a bit weird and borderline uncomfortable, but it still gave us a lot of characterization for Russell and even made him almost morally grey because we were sort of rooting for him to get the headmaster, but we knew what the future held. I really think the way they made us root for him and then realize we couldn't root for that was great.  
Also, I don't really think any of these issues deserve reservations in Deadpool 2 recommendations.",8k9ob3

If the movie was solely based around Wade and his search for vengeance, I would maybe agree with you more. In terms of Cable's WIR plot, I would say that's a little bit more of a lazy plot device so I agree with you on that one. I'm assuming that your issue with the other members of XForce besides Domino is that they were useless and essentially a waste of time story-wise, but the original intent of DP in his search for a team was to have help stopping Cable who showed himself to be a very dangerous enemy. So, with that in mind it would only make sense to have all of them go right? In terms of the headmaster, the whole deal was that he deserved to die but if the kid killed him he would become addicted to it and become a crazy murderer. I believe they killed the officers because the officers were trying to kill them.",8k9ob3
dztzo5a,"> There are two women in refridgerator plots in this, and it feels like a really lazy device to motivate your protagonist. I think the writers hamstrung themselves by having Deadpool have a love interest. 

I'd agree that it's an overused cliché, but I wouldn't go as far as ""hamstrung themselves."" It's hard to imagine either of the Deadpool movies without Vanessa, let alone both.

Remove the love story from the first movie and Wade is just an ex-Special Forces mercenary asshole who gets cancer. He has no reason not to drink himself to death when he gets the bad prognosis. If he gets powers anyway, he has no reason to wear that cool costume - no loved ones to maintain a secret identity to protect, and it's not like he'd care if the people he's killing think he's ugly. 

In the second movie, her death and his guilt is why he's suicidal. His desire for a family is why he was trying to kinda sorta do the bare minimum of the right thing for Russell. Take Vanessa out of this and Deadpool would either ignore Russell entirely or just let him kill the headmaster. 

Also, both movies would be incredible sausage-fests. There were other women, like Blind Al, Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Domino, and a few others, but they don't add much to the plots and they're more foils for Deadpool's jokes than characters themselves. I can't blame the writers for not wanting to have 4 hours of just Deadpool, Cable, and Colossus blowing things up and killing people. 

As for Cable's women in refrigerator plot, in the comics he came back in time to stop the X-Men villain Apocalypse from conquering the world. He's basically John Connor and the T-800 merged into one character (there's a lot more to it than that, but that's close enough for this). That would be derivative, and also more high-stakes and more morally black-and-white than everything else in these movies. That's probably why they wanted a more personal motivation for him. Maybe they should have picked a different one.

> So the kid doesn't get to kill the headmaster but Dopinder does? 

Deadpool doesn't have a problem with murder in general. But if Russell develops a taste for killing, apparently he becomes a horrifying serial killer and he has the power to do a lot of damage. There's little chance of Dopinder doing that.",8k9ob3

Everyone is happy 

Wade steals Cables time machine, has edgy teen fix it, goes back in time to save his GF, as well as kill shitty X-Men Wade and Ryan Reynolds before he can play in Green Lantern. 

**TL;DR**- Russel wants revenge on abusive orphanage but Cable wants to kill Russel because Russel turns bad after getting a taste of killing and somehow kills Cables family in the future but Deadpool wants to instead save Russel from turning bad instead of outright killing him like Cable wants to. They succeed and everyone is happy.

I really liked the movie, I think you're taking the movie too seriously for what it's meant to be.

>Cable sucked. ... What's his deal? Why does he have a metal arm? Why is he so proficient with guns? Why does he have time traveling technology? Why are he and future Russell such hardened enemies? 

Well, he is from the future. In which most likely time-travel became possible. From what I remember being said in the movie, he is some kind of mercenary/hitman. Deadpool talked about being in the special forces and he said he was from 'something similar'. So that's why he is able to use guns so effectively. 

The metal arm was never explained, but I guess that can be explained by the fact that he is from the future and living a life of being a mercenary/hitman, meaning that limbs may be shot-off sometimes.. 

Russell acquired a 'taste for blood' after he killed the director. So he became a serial-killer eventually. I think that's the case, at least. I don't think it goes anything deeper than that at all. Russell simply went on a murder-spree and he killed the wrong family. 

>(Cable) ... then just decides out of nowhere to make peace with them and that they're friends now.

He tried to kill Russell so that he couldn't kill Cable's family in the future. When the Juggernaut teamed up with Russell, he realized 1: he couldn't beat Juggernaut and Russell alone 2: Deadpool might actually help him. At that moment he believed Deadpool was trying to be a superhero (he talks to him about this in the car to the orphanage) so he would want to save the orphan kids. In reality, Deadpool wouldn't care about the orphans but would care about Russell going on the wrong path.

> Speaking of plot, why is a Deadpool movie suddenly all about family and compassion in the first place!? ... he's being put into boring, lazy, repetitive situations we've seen a million times already in CBMs.

It's a theme they are using in the movies. The first movie was a 'love story'. 

I think it's actually the *point* they are trying to make with both of these movies. They are essentially trying to parody love stories in the first one and family movies in the second one. 

If you don't like it that's fine, but it does actually make sense.

>There was basically no real antagonist of this movie, no really clear defined objectives, 

Well it's not a normal superhero where it's all about beating a villain. It was about saving a boy from getting on the wrong path. 

>very little significant character growth,

I don't actually agree with this, though. He has two major character growths. The first one is getting over the death of Venessa. 

 Like he said in the beginning, the second one is about family. His story arc is opening up to other people. He said that in the movie he loved Venessa, but she was also the only person he ever 'liked'. As in, allowing someone to be important to him. At the end of the movie he has accepted that it's okay to like his new friends. In Deadpool 1 he really didn't care for Colussus, or the cab driver. I think he has now accepted that it's okay to actually open up to these people and allow these people in.

He went from a loner who only let his lover in, to allowing multiple people in. ;)

But I agree with you, even if those things didn't bother me as much. My major beef was the sudden investment in saving this kid just because he was told he should. That's not interesting. They didn't bond at all. 

Cable was dull as a character, but he looked cool and Brolin is just a badass.

e0gj7h0,"> There was no reason for Deadpool to become so attached and so willing to risk everything to save him, and no reason for the audience to care.

He could have become attached to any kid.  The motivation was Morena Baccarin's death and the fact that they just decided to try to have a kid, and when Baccarin said ""kids are our chance to make something better than ourselves"" or something along those lines. Russell works well because of abuse he went through, just like Wade went through abuse as a kid.

> Cable sucked. He wasn't bad, just boring! What's his deal? Why does he have a metal arm? Why is he so proficient with guns? Why does he have time traveling technology? Why are he and future Russell such hardened enemies? All he is the entire movie is just some angry terminator who beats up Deadpool, and then just decides out of nowhere to make peace with them and that they're friends now. This is a character with tons of comic history and they turned him into a walking plot device.

I agree, this could have been deeper. Very few superhero movies have interesting villains, but I did appreciate that they built a connection between him and Deadpool.

> The story was phoned in. There was basically no real antagonist of this movie, no really clear defined objectives, very little significant character growth, etc. Wade ends the film right back where he started from the beginning, literally. He already had made a good connection with the X-Men after stopping Ajax, and only slightly lost it, only to regain it again. Bad writing 101. He learned nothing from any of it. It's not even like he's going to try and be a serious X-Men now, he never learns to stop killing which was what got him into trouble in the first place and it's not like his personality is going to go away.

> Speaking of plot, why is a Deadpool movie suddenly all about family and compassion in the first place!?

There are literally so many other heroes and teams dedicated to exploring literally every single one of these themes and doing it a hundred times better.

These two points contradict each other lol. First you complain about a lack of development of Deadpool as a character, then you complain that Deadpool isn't Deadpool enough.

IW is amazing that it actually works despite having a ton of characters. Storywise, it is not a great movie. There are lots of things wrong with it that are papered over by the fast pace and really good special effects. 

I thought the writing was very lazy with DP2, and the 4th wall was broken way too many times and inappropriately. But I still did enjoy the movie.

Most people in the theater enjoyed IW and most people in theater enjoyed DP2 - so I get why they have a similar score. 

> The line before the Juggernaut/Colossus fight, for example, was unnecessary and detracted from a pretty epic fight.

Lowered the stakes, definitely. But it also lowered the expectations, making the end result a lot more fun that I thought it would be. If you care a lot about the characters of the movie outside DP, sure it undermines them. If you don't particularly care about the characters outside the movie, it is a lot of fun. 

> But my biggest issue was the first act. It was too depressing and a downer. 

Everything said was an over the top, cliched telegraphing that his gf was about to be iced. That is a well worn comedic trope in itself. Go watch Hot Shots 1 and part duex. If it actually pulled on some emotional strings, it did its job really well. 

> Took too long to get fun and funny. 

Darker humor is still fun.

> Not sure how excited this makes me for a X-Force movie.

Did not know there was an X-force outside this movie, so this is a comic book fan vs just movie watcher thing.

> Good, not great. Prefer the 1st one. 

The RT score worked in your case.

Usually the effects are pretty subtle: She may move at just the right moment, or a fly may disturb the sniper as he takes the shot and makes it miss.  Similarly, she might miss a shot, but it will ricochet and hit the target anyway (or hit something else that hits them).

The landing on the inflatable panda, or falling right into the cabin on the truck were examples I'd expect from the comics.  Cars flipping and stuff is more grandiose than usual for her, but it's more cinematic.

Her powers have a limit too.  There has to be *something* that can be affected within the bounds of reality.  She isn't a reality warper.  If Domino is falling from a plane with no chute, she's not going to see an airbag appear under her, no ally is going to appear to save her unless they were already on the way.

If something happens in a Deadpool movie that is meant as a joke, like the inclusion of the younger x-men actors, don’t get concerned with continuity. If Deadpool kills Ryan Reynolds, the star of the Green Lantern, do not be concerned with canon. If Deadpool calls Cable Thanos... why are we concerned with this stuff?

I understand that a lot of people don’t actually “get” Deadpool, and he has become very popular in the last ten years so he had been over-utilized in the books to the point that a Deadpool “canon” is almost an oxymoron. This combined with movie-goers expectations based on the MCU and DC’s attempt at one has probably contributed to this happening. But, at least in my opinion, Reynolds and co took a shot with the first one, clearly it wasn’t intended to be considered canon in the “continuity” that is the FOX X-Men Universe, and it did well so they made another one.

Have you read any of the Cable/Deadpool comics? If you're familiar with the characters, you would have been more annoyed that the trailers made it seem like Cable was the antagonist. Regardless, pretty much the entire first and second act *was* Deadpool vs. Cable, so...yeah.

Certainly better than Vinnie Jones' version in X3. He felt kinda flat, though, since he doesn't get his reveal until pretty much the end of the movie. He wasn't really the antagonist so much as an obstacle.

Also, I wouldn't make this part of your common fridging trope. Because in that trope, the hero's love interest is murdered and that pushes the hero to act against the murderer for the rest of the plot. But this didn't really happen in the movie. Deadpool did kill the murderer but only a few minutes later. He spends pretty much the rest of the movie doing something that isn't related to Vanessa's death. And when he does do something related to Vanessa's death, it's suicide so that he could be with her. But it's not your typical case of, ""You killed my wife. I will now spend this entire movie getting my revenge!"" Instead, it's, ""Vanessa's dead. I need something to keep me from killing myself. Saving Russell fits the bill.""

Or to put it another way, if Vanessa had not died, would Wade have still gone on to rescue Russell? I think he would have because he is that type of person. Vanessa could have simply hung out back home and he would have still found himself in the Ice Block with Russell. We've seen in the first movie that Wade has a heart deep down when he went after that stalker on that girl's behalf (even if she hired him. He would have done it anyway because he doesn't like people like that.) He would have looked after Russell. Only he would have been more active from the get go instead of mopey in his jail cell.

dz6bvli,It was actually performed by the original band,8k9ob3
dz7l3xz,"They also reference Interview with the Vampire, like, 3/4 times before his cameo, which makes it even better",8k9ob3
dz9mfeo,But it was enough to get him listed in the credits,8k9ob3
dz9t4bf,"I had a feeling when they kept ""showing"" him that at one point he'd be revealed briefly and be some big name. I was not expecting it to be by gruesome death haha.",8k9ob3

dz9lzr2,"I totally didn't think it was foreshadowing, just windy, it happens haha. Was actually really funny especially since The Vanisher does exist and you see who plays him and it made me laugh way too hard. 
",8k9ob3
dzd4f0m,"Three times, there’s a wind advisory warning in the news ticker when they’re doing the news report about the orphanage ",8k9ob3
dz6bwqz,It seemed to be a pretty big flashing red light. Knowing from the trailers they'd jump out with parachutes and having two wind advisory jokes made it pretty obvious at least a few were going to run into major parachute issues.,8k9ob3
dz7hyf1,"Yeah, Zeitgeist was the only one that had my interest as well. Was pretty bummed. Glad we got to see his power though! Hahaha",8k9ob3
dz7d4w4,"Shatterstar was one of my favorite characters when I was a kid, reading the comics... I'm so sad to see that this is how it happened, but also it was pretty damn funny.",8k9ob3

Those deaths were super fucking gruesome. ",8k9ob3

dz6lw01,Luckily nobody in my theater laughed at anything so I was able to enjoy the movie.,8k9ob3
dz67kce,Thank god. He better come back in future movies!,8k9ob3
dz8vzrg,Except he lived,8k9ob3
dz63vj0,They had actual scenes in the trailer that never were I'm the movie. Was really good to be surprised.,8k9ob3
dz69u3y,Probably because he is entirely CGI. There won't be leaked set photos and the likes haha,8k9ob3
dz6cyl8,The trailer actually did tease Jugs. When Domino takes over the convoy there's a shot of the dashboard with shows his (very distinctive) silhouette on a monitor.,8k9ob3

Still, it was hilarious that he was playing yet another kid who just wants to be a gangster.",8k9ob3
dz8op2w,Pulling an idea out of your ass. ,8k9ob3
dzb5rde,"I was in a state of absolute hype at the sheer accuracy of his characterization after the shit pile we got in X3, and they delivered so hard.

A man with immeasurable strength and invulnerability who is just a giant bully. Doing whatever he wants and talking shit while doing it.

I was terrified when it seemed like he might have been killed off by something that wouldn't work on him. Glad to see him pop right out of the pool at the end.",8k9ob3
dz8z2v0,"It was, but not green-screened this time. They added a hologram display for him to look at (to find Russell's cell-block) instead of looking at the arm for no reason.",8k9ob3
dzfe16w,I think with what Deadpool went through in the first movie he knew the truck collision wouldn't kill him.,8k9ob3
dz9vejm,Are we sure that moment wasn't from a DC movie?,8k9ob3
dz9kdlg,"It was both. He needed a hug, and he wanted to kill the guy, and he wanted to kill himself. ",8k9ob3
dzbzg3f,Yeah I think right from the beginning he felt like it was his fault,8k9ob3
dzjp4ag,"I thought it was more like he thought that there were multiple people responsible for her death, but he was the only one who was still alive?",8k9ob3
dz9ru8r,I thought it was an ambulance too,8k9ob3
dz6af01,Oh duh he was the redneck guy talking about the proper way to wipe!!! Haha is Matt Damon the new Stan lee of cameos first Thor ragnorak now this?!! Thanks for telling me would’ve never known ,8k9ob3

dz69jd8,Matt Damon? I can't remember him in dp2,8k9ob3
dz63s80,I might be wrong but it seemed like they just CGI'd Pitt's face into that scene ,8k9ob3
dz6tugf,Hugh Jackman did not film anything new for this film. It was all stock footage. ,8k9ob3
dz87guu,Bobby Roode agrees it would be Glorious ,8k9ob3
e4m0l74,They did a secret Jackman cameo in the first one?,8k9ob3

dz68oqo,"""You're welcome Canada. ""

😂",8k9ob3
dz6p50g,Can I hust say... Green Leantern wasnt Ryan's fault at all. I loved him as Hal. And Mark Strong was incredible as Sinestro. The film just sucked.,8k9ob3
dz6ejsl,That shit was so meta it was unbelievable ,8k9ob3
dzhohmp,A guy in the cinema started applauding on that scene.,8k9ob3
dz6nohm,"apparently the original screening shown Deadpool killing baby Hitler, but it got cut from the theatrical relase. I hope the scene gets added as a bonus when it comes out on blue\-ray, all the more reason to buy it.",8k9ob3

dz6gquk,ah fuck there was an after credits scene? :(,8k9ob3
dz6hx81,He opened his eyes after that. Was it the end credits scene? I don't remember.,8k9ob3
dz68mlf,Pretty sure it was the other way around ,8k9ob3
dz85ece,"Another subtle joke is that the beginning of the film is Deadpool being upset that Logan dies in his film and stole his rated R, Deadpool dies in this film and even in his dying moments they played the music Logan died to. ",8k9ob3
dz75ssp,"I loved that threat from Juggernaut too, especially when Deadpool yelled ""I BELIEVE HIM"" after.  I mean, after the scene of him ripping Deadpool in half, I definitely believed him too.",8k9ob3
dz6tmpj,This makes me wish I could write as well as that.,8k9ob3
dz78ocz,Another moment like that is how Russell killing will want him to do it more. The same thing happened to Dopinder but I feel like this instance is more obvious. ,8k9ob3
dz6vkt7,Whatever it didn't even hurt,8k9ob3
dzbnp75,I never would have noticed this is you didn't point it out ,8k9ob3
dzcuplv,"Thank you, you too!",8k9ob3

dz9ub0g,"Man, it wasn't even five seconds",8k9ob3
dz65vsm,"I assume that he's a super nerd since his best friend, Ben Affleck, is a super nerd, and to me this seems like the best way to do the super hero movies: cameo in all of them so you get to experience the magic but don't have to stress if you're doing one of your favorite characters justice.",8k9ob3
dz6bxgt,He's been doing that ever since Euro Trip. ,8k9ob3

dzavj7u,Dont forget Interstellar haha,8k9ob3
dzb8btf,He had the surprise role in interstellar as well.,8k9ob3

dz6c4sp,Was the other guy in Pirates of the Caribbean with the fake eye?,8k9ob3
dz67xtu,It’s the scene where Cable is like what year is it and steals the truck,8k9ob3
dz687id,"Did you not see the Martian? I know its a few years old now, but not forever. ",8k9ob3
dz6r469,"I have no idea how this person has clocked then as Matt Damon, I saw it a second time and spent the whole scene trying to guess who it is. It's not been confirmed as Matt Damon either.

Edit: actually it has been confirmed as Matt Damon, but I still doubt anyone could have recognised him, he looks and sounds super different. ",8k9ob3
dz6dw2w,[deleted],8k9ob3

And I like they kept it consistent the whole movie",8k9ob3
dz6g4at,"I found it kind of relatable, when your partner gets along well with your friend but they dont really know each other this is exactly what happens",8k9ob3
dz6v5k4,"I think it's just unexpected in the way Deadpool and Yukio are so cordial with one another. 

Yukio is a cute kpop idol looking girl that would look like she isn't into violence or such things but has no problem smiling and waving to a hardcore killer. And the same with Deadpool who has a persona of gives no fucks and is always snarky.",8k9ob3

So it probably was barely any work for them to fly 4 hours to DP2 set and film that scene. 

This is evident by the fact that Dark Phoenix is set in the 90s and in the cameo QuickSilver is wearing a Nirvana t-shirt.

dzdi1ni,"The best thing about it was that when Domino debuted in the '90s (along with Deadpool, Cable, etc.) these were the exact conversations kids and comic book fans had, lol. I remember my friends being like 'luck's not a superpower! How does it work??' It was hilarious seeing that play out, from Wade not believing it to her actually flexing the luck.",8k9ob3

dz9rp2q,Don't think the luck thing would really be able to hold up for more than just secondary character scenes like in this movie. It's fun when she's just backup but I feel like it would get old to have a whole movie where the main character is undefeatable and knows it,8k9ob3

dzk06v2,"I've stopped watching trailers for the last 3 or so years and it has significantly improved my move-going experience.

The only time it ""Backfired"" was Shape of Water. My only other Del Toro films were Pacific Rim, so I assumed some sort of Thriller and kept waiting for that to happen, never did. 

Good movie but I went in with a completely incorrect mindset. ",8k9ob3
dzd4b6h,"Same here, I quit watching trailers and this was awesome.",8k9ob3
dzjvnvm,I do the same thing. I have stopped watching trailers since The Amazing Spider\-Man 2.,8k9ob3
dztgm50,What about posters or any other promotional material. Hiding Hulk from yourself seems like a really hard task.,8k9ob3

dz8a6ql,"I think the point was that the wind threw them all way off target and landed them in the worst places possible.  Drawing out the diving scene and making it super badass was a great misdirection for what ended up happening.

dz75g04,"They did enough tongue-in-cheek acknowledging of it in the movie anyway.  Deadpool is a rare character who can pretty much get away with that.  And honestly, it doesn't really take away from the actual scenes in the movie where her death adds weight and emotion.  They got away with using it as a legitimate dramatic plot point, while still allowing her to return in the future, which I'm all for.",8k9ob3

I really hope more people will pick up on that because I think it's absolutely hilarious but it'll go unnoticed.

It was a vulgar, R-Rated unapologetic anti-hero movie that was really funny so everyone forgave shallow characters (Ajax) and flimsy plot (simple revenge story). It was mediocre in a lot of ways, mainly just movie stuff like color pallette and cinematography but the charisma carried it.

Deadpool 2 needed to just be better to make up for the fact that we know what to expect, so it just upped the ante with the story and characters, and the action was a lot better. 

I feel like I enjoyed DP2 equally as much as the first, but I know the sequel was better objectively. Humor is about the same, lots of chuckles with a few stand-out belly laughs (and a post credits that left me in tears.)",8k9ob3

Other Liefeldisms include, but are not limited to:
* Dozens upon dozens of pouches on any given character
* 10 foot tall men with biceps as big as their chests

Back in Deadpool vol 1, #4 is the firs time anyone other than DP sees his face.  He flips out and does a whole ""give me my face"" bit like Rorschach.  Except in his case, it's because he's scarred and ugly and genuinely doesn't want Siryn, who he's been hitting on, to see his real face.

X-Force.  One of their missions is to kill the reincarnation of Apocalypse as a kid before he gets powerful.  DP ends up convincing them to save him and send him to the Jean Grey school instead.  [This exchange happens later.](http://www.adventuresinpoortaste.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/DeadpoolKid.jpg).  That then leads to the revelation that [DP hasn't been cashing his X-Force checks](http://www.4thletter.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/xforce4.jpg), he's be doing it pro-bono as a super hero, not a merc.

Then there's the baby bird scene.  DP and Angel are stranded in the wilderness, and Angel's been drained by Pestilence.  Angel's got a healing factor, but it's not on the level of Wolverine or Deadpool.  To keep him alive, [DP goes to some great lengths.](https://comicnewbies.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/deadpool-feeds-archangel-with-his-own-body-2.jpg?w=620&h=968)

[The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/The_Good,_the_Bad,_and_the_Ugly) deals with Deapool teaming up with Captain America and Wolverine to infiltrate a North Korean prison camp where they find out that NK is trying to breed their own super soldiers, using Deadpool's DNA.  DP is suitably *horrified* by what's happening, and he earns the respect of Wolverine and Cap during this event, the latter is a pretty big deal and eventually leads to DP ending up on an Avengers team.

Finally, during his NK stint, he learns he has a *daughter*.  At first, he thinks it best he stay away, but eventually he owns up.  She mostly lives with the family of one of his friends (as he really isn't in the position to raise a kid), but he does care for her deeply.  During Secret Empire, part of his reason for following Cap (aside from his nearly-blind loyalty to Cap) is to protect his kid.  He also ends up taking a contract to kill Cable, among others, to save her and the family she's staying with.

If you had never seen a comic book movie or read a comic or paid attention to pop culture, you might still laugh at dick/fart jokes and a lot of the physical comedy. But the more you know about those things, the more jokes you'll find or the more satirical parts are.

I thought the death bit was a little long, but it also reminded me SO much of Trinity's death scene in the Matrix, I had to laugh at it.

Some people would think of that as just fluff on fluff, but I appreciate humor that's funnier the more you know, even if the stuff you have to know is just esoteric garbage.",8k9ob3

Domino has an impact on the story. That's her entire thing. She is lucky and was affecting the outcome as soon as she was involved.

The entire story is rooted in Vanessa's death.

Warhead and her girlfriend serve as comedic elements only. 

Colossus is the same as in the first film.  Same impact. Same agent of change for Deadpool to develop from villain into antihero.

It was handled well in my opinion because it doesn't actually involve the huge cast much at all.  It kills most of them off immediately.  They all serve a specific purpose.  Mostly, comedic.

>that said scene is set in a different period but that's b/c it was used from a different film ('dark phoenix').

So now DP can jump across timelines whenever he wants? So Colosus and Negasonic are part of the present but the [X-Men](#spoiler)  are part of the past? How does that make sense? This is why I asked the question in the first place.",8k9ob3

dzzdp3v,But don't they talk about tweeting and stuff? And so many present-day things are there.,8k9ob3
dz6u5df,I think it was written that way on purpose. Deadpool himself is being pulled in different directions during hat portion of the film. He’s so depressed he wants to die but he’s also developing a liking for this kid and trying to decide if he should protect him. Wades mind is thrown into disarray after his gf’s murder. The audience gets to feel the uncertainty dwelling within him. ,8k9ob3

Hope is also Jean's granddaughter in the comics, which is another reason why I thought with the Jean Grey Phoenix movie coming out, that Hope Summers' chances of showing up on screen would be slim.

The Terminator is also better as a horror movie. So I'm betting people who are fans of horror over action will like the first movie more. Myself- I am more of an action person so I do like T2 more. ",8k9ob3
dze6ndz,"I agree that it was a bit more of a parody for action movies in general whereas the first film was just the comic genre. There were elements of Looper, Terminator 2 in the story. The action was more action-y rather than just being funny action, and of course they were also making fun of the shared universe more as opposed to just simple franchising. 

Guardians is another solid example. I think even leaving the theater last year after Vol. 2 I was thinking I liked the first better, but then after some time and even watching it again I realized I was actually more partial to Vol. 2 just because I had a deeper satisfaction with the characters and overall weirdness.

But I don’t see that happening, Deadpool is way better on his own and not being dragged into that. Sure, it would be great if future Deadpool movies referenced whatever is going on in the X-men or even MCU continuities, but trying to figure out “canon” in these movies is probably not the way to go. The point of them is to be fun and entertaining, I highly doubt we are going to have Deadpool showing up and playing roles in the X-Men or Marvel movies, as much as I would like that to be the case I just doubt it will happen.

DP2 was one step closer into making a perfect adaptation of the comic Deadpool. Now all we need is his brain monologues. XD

dzez248,"> And then the contrast of negasonic and yukio's personalities, and the recurring interaction between Yukio and Mr. Pool.

It just felt like a repeated punchline, rather than something like Negasonic and Deadpool's relationship developing over the first film. 

> Francis had very little characterization, whereas we learned about Russel's (the pseudo antagonist sort of) experiences that fueled his hate for the institution and its headmaster (the real villain). 

My problem is that he just becomes ""big mean killer"" after just killing one guy who tortured him, then goes off to kill Cable's family because......I genuinely don't know why. 

> Then we get lighter characterization of the headmaster when he seems to use a mix of religion and something else as an excuse to hate the mutants. 

I had the same problem with Logan's antagonist. I get ""because religion/science/whatever-end-game"" is kind of an easy excuse for motivation, but it doesn't help that we really don't know anything about this character. This is where I think at least Francis was explained that he doesn't feel anything, so most of his evil is just him trying to experience something close to emotions. 

>  I agree that the Wade/Russell dynamic and situation was a bit weird and borderline uncomfortable,

I just thought it was underwritten, and that it really should have been more about Wade naturally learning to like Russell as a person rather than have it be his motivation to getting back to Venessa in the afterlife. 

> Also, I don't really think any of these issues deserve reservations in Deadpool 2 recommendations.

It's that with the fact that I think the lack of punch in the editing was a problem where all the jokes in the first film (>90% of them, for me) landed and were all done well since Miller was versed in animation and pre-production. This felt more....freeform? Like they generally storyboarded the entire movie, but just recorded things they thought were funny in the moment without really considering how it would flow with the film. 

> Also, I don't really think any of these issues deserve reservations in Deadpool 2 recommendations.

It's not that I don't recommend the film. It's that I recommend it, with reservations. Especially for those who were fans of the first movie. I still think it's worth watching, but I got diminished enjoyment from this film in comparison to the first one. 

I do like in this film how they use objects throughout the story for humor as well as storytelling purposes, like the two strudles in the microwave Wade didn't take out, Venessa's coin, Cable's teddy bear, Russel's pen, etc. 

However, I also feel like, unlike the first film, whenever they would do a reoccurring joke, they wouldn't really add onto it or change it up in an interesting way. 

> I feel like the bad cgi was almost on purpose? Like when the jet ludicrously lands near the institution. Maybe other instances weren't purposeful, but the Jet definitely felt purposeful. Like another budget joke.

I think that's a really hard thing to do on purpose, and for me, it didn't land, especially since the CG in the first film looks MUCH better than this film's attempts. ",8k9ob3

I couldn't get into the whole idea of Deadpool believing he needs to save this kid because his girlfriend said something about kids being important. That is ultra-weak motivation. And I understood perfectly the anarchic message of the first movie. Colossus begs Deadpool to spare a villain's life and he shoots him cold instead. We know where everyone stands there. Here, Deadpool begs Cable to save the kid's life and then begs the kid not to kill the villain...even though Deadpool killed all the villain's henchmen a minute ago. And then another character kills the villain anyway and no one minds much. So what's the message or the punchline here? I just don't get it. The first movie's ending made a perfect point.

So in a way they are doing the same thing they dislike about its publicity, so they give it less credit than it deserves because they think, rightly or wrongly, that it is getting more credit than it deserves.

To them the best way to accomplish this is to compare it directly with other superhero movies. They think doing so will draw more attention to the fact that it isn’t as good as the critics say it is.

After authorities evacuated passengers and searched Amtrak Train 2256, it turned out that Miller was actually on Amtrak Train 2258, which was also evacuated of passengers and searched.[46] No evidence of any explosive device or materials was detected after officials stopped and inspected both trains.

Deadpool talked about being in the special forces and he said he was from 'something similar'. So that's why he is able to use guns so effectively.

But you see, everything you explained is by definition a bad character. Your explanations for literally the most obvious aspects of who he is pretty much revolve around just guessing and assuming everything. If the point of Cable was mysterious that would be one thing, but obviously with the family aspect that isn't what they were trying to do and the lack of actual backstory for him is just the result of bad writing. 

> He tried to kill Russell so that he couldn't kill Cable's family in the future. When the Juggernaut teamed up with Russell, he realized 1: he couldn't beat Juggernaut and Russell alone 2: Deadpool might actually help him. At that moment he believed Deadpool was trying to be a superhero (he talks to him about this in the car to the orphanage) so he would want to save the orphan kids. In reality, Deadpool wouldn't care about the orphans but would care about Russell going on the wrong path.

Why didn't he go to the X-Men for help then? The movie clearly goes out of there way to prove they exist and are the go to source for Mutant troubles. Why Deadpool? The man who would do nothing but get in the way of his goal? 

Maybe you could argue the X-Men would stop him from killing Russell too, but he doesn't have to tell them anything more than he's trying to stop Juggernaut and needs their help. The only reason he goes to Deadpool is because the plot needs him to, there was no in-universe reason that would be the logical decision in that time. 

> It's a theme they are using in the movies. The first movie was a 'love story'. I think it's actually the point they are trying to make with both of these movies. They are essentially trying to parody love stories in the first one and family movies in the second one.

What did they parody about a love story in this movie? Nothing about or the ending or his goals were ironic or inversed any tropes. They followed all of them in the most cliche way imaginable. The humor in the movie literally all came from Deadpool making pop culture references, breaking the fourth wall, or recycling jokes from the first movie. Very little, if any of the plot was actually parodied in a significant way. 

>Well it's not a normal superhero where it's all about beating a villain. It was about saving a boy from getting on the wrong path.

That's not about being a ""normal"" superhero movie, it's about having a plot and not being a random, disjointed mess. You say the film was about stopping Russell from turning evil, but that was just one of many, many threads they had going. First it was about getting over Vanessa's death, then it was about getting out of jail, then it was about saving Russell from Cable, then it was assembling the X-Force, then it was about stopping him going down the wrong path, then it was finally about Deadpool gaining a family. 

The movie had small time antagonists scattered all throughout the subplots but a lack of an actual overarching villain is a hallmark of how unfocused and overstuffed this movie was with these disconnected meaningless stories most people don't even seem to even remember. 

> I don't actually agree with this, though. He has two major character growths. The first one is getting over the death of Venessa.

He never gets over Vanessa's death. Hell, he literally goes back in time and stops her from dying in the end credits!

> Like he said in the beginning, the second one is about family. His story arc is opening up to other people. He said that in the movie he loved Venessa, but she was also the only person he ever 'liked'. As in, allowing someone to be important to him. At the end of the movie he has accepted that it's okay to like his new friends. In Deadpool 1 he really didn't care for Colussus, or the cab driver. I think he has now accepted that it's okay to actually open up to these people and allow these people in.

This is the same thing he learned in the first movie. He already had learned to open up to Vanessa, and openly rejected the X-Men claiming they weren't his style but came to a mutual respect for Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Only for this movie for him to have relearn to like them and then for some reason decide he actually *does* want to be a part of the X-Men, even though he clearly established at the end of Deadpool 1 he doesn't care about that!

He was never a loner even when Vanessa died, he still talked to Dophinder, Weasel and Blind Al afterwards. And unless the next Deadpool has him as a full time member of the X-Men, none of this out of left field characterization is even going to stick. 

It's cool if you liked the movie because of its humor or what have you, I have no problem with that. But objectively this plot was a mess and completely went against everything Deadpool was shown to be in the first film. ",8k9ob3

This is hard to explain, but basically I felt 90% of the humour was simply referencing a superhero and expecting me to laugh. But, for me, you actually have to make a comment on the thing you're referencing, or make some kind of joke along with the reference, you know? Like just simply saying ""I'm Batman"" in Batman's voice isn't funny. And the other 10% of the humour was fourth-wall breaks, which get old real quick.

Because me and my friends shared exactly the same opinions and there wasn't much laughter in my (pretty packed) screening, I was kind of expecting at least 1 of the top 200 comments to say something similar, but literally not even 1 comment in the top 200 said anything negative, which really shocked me.

At first I thought they were poking fun at the first X-men movie being a major rolemodel for the gay community, but they kept putting small lines like it in the rest of the movie, about racism as well. It just felt a bit out of tone with the otherwise really funny humor. Like they felt the need to include it because it's 'hip'.",8k9ob3
e3zyu51,"No, there are actually a lot of them, though I think they're more **jokes** and **not** actual SJW stuffs:

- X-Men and X-Person
- DP insulting cable racist when Cable want to turn off the indian music
- Black Tom, White Tom stuffs.

EDIT: I'm just trying to explain the original commenter. I even said they are more on jokes side ._. There, I bolded it now",8k9ob3
dze7e0t,"Zazie Beetz plays a character on the Show Atlanta. In an episode, she goes to Drake's mansion for New Years party to meet him. Instead she finds just a card board cut out and people asking for donations to take an instagram picture with him. She wasnt lucky enough to get a picture with actual Drake.

I suspect a lot people are sleeping on the show, but the Character she plays on Atlanta literally mirrors the personality she has when she plays Domino, almost like that's her alter-ego. People can downvote, but go watch the show. Van from Atlanta, is basically Domino's personality throughout Deadpool 2. That Cab scene especially.",8k9ob3

dz9yasa,"So there's a comic book (and movie) trope called ""fridging"" where the (often grisly) death of the hero's girlfriend/wife is an impetus for character growth, named so because one of the most prominent examples involved a dead girlfriend being stuffed in a fridge for Green Lantern to find. The irony is, Deadpool 2 used this trope as the basis for its story, when the trope was originally named by a Deadpool writer, and the chief example is from Green Lantern who was played by Reynolds (and joked about a lot in the movie - although the GL involved in the trope wasn't the one he played). 

But the movie played it straight without making a meta-joke about the trope (with the director stating that he didn't realize they had ended up using the trope). That doesn't make it a bad or sexist movie, the person you replied to was just making the comment that it's funny that the creators of the movie didn't pick up on it. ",8k9ob3

Jerry Duggan's run (which just finished) could be an incredibly depressing book at times for such a fun character. Here though there never was any connection to what was going on which made the heartfelt stuff they tried to do at the end just feel flat. 

As for taking comic book movies seriously, there are a lot of better comic book films where i at least care to some degree whats happening on screen. the problem is that this was a good film, i just didn't care the whole way through.

To me it's basically the same movie as the first one.  Not in that it's a retread like TFA to ANH but more like you could inter splice the two movies randomly and it'd probably still work.  Events would be odd but the tone and energy are exactly the same, which should be a good thing but I don't know it wasn't for me.  

And I heard this one had something like more of a heart to it.  I think the first one had just as much if not more emotion.

There doesn't seem to be a ""butterfly effect"" established here given Cable's ""my family is safe"" line even if he doesn't travel back to them. And turning Russell sees like a major event in the timeline. Seems more like a ""hey this is a goofy comic scenario that you should just accept for what it is, and not over analyze"" type of deal.

dzlcsb8,Deadpool (the comics) is slathered in fourth wall breaking.,8k9ob3
dzj0i7d,"Oh, I agree. 

I mean, they executed what they wanted as well as they could, if that makes sense. 

IIRC, the 4th wall breaks aren’t just a meta-fictional character trait choice but also a “symptoms” of Wade transforming to DP (insanity). 

In the first film, Wade only made those under the radar hints, almost like verbal Easter eggs. 

Once he became DP only then did he directly break the 4th wall. He never narrated in the present tense about healthy Wade Wilson. 


TLDR - the first movie had fewer 4th wall breaks because he wasn’t Deadpool until about the 2nd act. ",8k9ob3

It wouldn't have been a good plot device in **any** context, yet Snyder followed through with it to the point where it was release as part of the movie.

His roastee speech at the end is just him saying how no one else in the Marvel comics likes him. That they all think he's insane and not helpful, no matter how much he actually tries to help. He makes the audience start laughing with the IG, because that's all he is, a big joke. He leaves then turns on the readers.

There was too much pressure on this to live up to the original, the plot was just not very well executed, and the laughs were there, but goddamn this shit just felt so out of place.

I'm not going to praise this movie as flawless just because he cusses and makes jokes like 90% of the fanbase. This did not, in any way, live up to or surpass the original. The big D in this was for Dissapointing. In MY OPINION (just had to capitalize that for the ones who think opinions are a matter of fact and take personal offense. ) it's almost like the Star Wars prequels for me, the moments like the action, the jokes, the references, the great characters like Juggernaut, Cable, and Domino, are not enough to carry this entire film as ""good"".

dzf0s3z,"> It just felt like a repeated punchline, rather than something like Negasonic and Deadpool's relationship developing over the first film.  
  
I agree that it felt like that, but there is humor in a repeated punchline. There is a difficult line to pinpoint for where to stop repeating it, and I dont think they crossed that line. Sort of like in Thor Ragnarok when Thor is hanging from the chains at the very start and has to ask Surtur to pause in his monologue because he is spinning. Its sort of the absurdity of the repetition. Obviously its not funny for everyone, nothing is, but I think thats what they were going for. The last interaction between Yukio and Deadpool really got a laugh from me.  
  
> My problem is that he just becomes ""big mean killer"" after just killing one guy who tortured him, then goes off to kill Cable's family because......I genuinely don't know why.  
  
I'm not trying to be unkind, but I'd give the movie another watch. Its repeated a couple times that he basically gets off to killing to the headmaster and gets a taste for killing, and continues to do so . Then Cable tries to stop him and fails and he strikes at Cable's family to get back at Cable.  
  
>  ""because religion/science/whatever-end-game""   
  
I feel like that will always be a recurring thing with x-men/mutant stories. It was part of their conception (with the allegory of mutants/homosexuality that Deadpool even refers to in a 4th wall moment) and it continues to be relevant because of human nature's xenophobia and tribalism. I understand being tired of it though honestly.   
  
I completely agree about the Russell and Wade relationship.  
  
> I think that's a really hard thing to do on purpose, and for me, it didn't land, especially since the CG in the first film looks MUCH better than this film's attempts.  
  
I don't particularly remember specifics about the first movies cgi although I don't think they had anything specifically unrealistic except colosus and the shipping yard collapse (which looked meh), so I cant really comment there. But I for sure think the xmen jet was purposefully shit cgi, because my friend and I both commented as soon as we saw the jet flying and doing a hilarious landing. I mean it just looked ridiculous and couldnt be serious. The kind of jet they used as the image of the xmen jet looked very placeholder and it isn't the kind of jet that can fly like that. [This is the kind of jet used in Deadpool 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird) and [this is what the xmen jet looks like.](http://xmenmovies.wikia.com/wiki/X-Jet?file=X2jet24.jpg). Again, its not neccessarily something everyone would catch or find funny per se. Im not saying it was some deep humour.  
Also, my friend and I were discussing the Juggernaut after the movie and how as SOON as we saw him he looked obviously fake. We didn't think that was purposefully bad cgi, but we concluded that there was no way for them to make it look REAL. It was likely decent/good cgi, but it looks so out of place because it doesnt fit what our brains know as reality, so subconsciously we feel that its not right. I'd say Juggernaut looked about as good as Thanos, and both of them didn't look real. There arent purple men as large as thanos just as there arent enormous men as large as the Juggernaut. Also though, Im glad they did the juggernaut faithfully to the comics rather than normal sized like in the xmen movies.
   
Edit: Also, I just realized I replied to you twice in this thread with the same words. I didnt look at usernames, my bad.
  
",8k9ob3
dz7epdy,"Deadpool has no problem with killing the henchman or with the death of the headmaster. He wasn't trying to prevent the headmaster from dying (he literally tried to execute him for abusing the children). The whole point was that the kid would get a taste for killing in general, not just killing bad guys. 

And there was a literal punchline... He says right after dopinder kills him that he heard him coming for the last 30s and almost couldn't keep a straight face during his ""don't kill him"" speech. The ""message"" as it were, is that being a hero doesn't mean you can't kill and you don't have to fight fair. He says several times throughout the movie something along those lines. ",8k9ob3

Colossus has also fought Thor and Hulk before. In no universe is Jug way more powerful than colossus. Even your own example its a close fight when colossus is drunk.

I interpreted it as a near death experience, and so he was brought near the afterlife (which exists in this movie, which isn't that surprising since magic basically exists in the X-Men universe), and that's why he couldn't go past that barrier and reach Vanessa. But he was close enough to communicate with her. Or it was him hallucinating since he was basically dead.

The dialogue that wasnt an one-liner joke/a swear word, was down right awful/lazy (i get they said lazy writing, but it was really bad). The jokes were not as funny as the first one either.
Brolin just idn it seemed like a poor impersanation of thanos (not his fault, cable wasnt nearly as compelling ). again no plot. a lot more cruder than the first one, for the sake of crudeness not for a laugh.

At the end of the day though, nobody wants to see a Deadpool movie with that kind of stuff in it. Most DP fans want gore, foul language, and dick jokes. DP2 delivers on all of that. 


I agree that Duggan did a great job sticking to what I feel is the core of Deadpool.  The early Deadpool runs (late 90's early 2000's) are darker and more depressing where you can tell he uses humor as an outlet for depression rather than the ""hurr durr chimichangas""in the later runs. 

** Also, I really enjoyed Deadpools portrayal in Uncanny X-force. I hope they have the same team dynamic with Cable replacing Wolverine as the straight man in the upcoming movies. I think they might have even taken a few bits and pieces from that run for this movie. ",8k9ob3

Once again, I feel like they've already done that in Deadpool. They don't really add onto the personalities or comedy of Yukio and Negasonic besides Wade saying ""hi/bye.""

dzfh64m,"Would be fun to have a randomizer effect on the movie, so that each time you watch it the lines are a bit different. ",8k9ob3
dz79nx0,They switched up the placement of 'pump the hate-brakes' too from DP saying it to Cable to saying it to NTW.  ,8k9ob3
dzbgbjd,Dopinder flipping out when Peter made the team made up for that. At least to me. ,8k9ob3
e0ph7xz,It's always going to be a trend unfortunately :( but enough people are having success with brief trailers that at least we'll see a few of these ,8k9ob3
dz6au82,"NO FREAKING WAY!! Just googled it and you're right.
I am disappointed that Alan Tudyk doesn't have a bigger role in Deadpool. ",8k9ob3
dz6bbah,He was originally called on to play Cable as well.,8k9ob3
dz6ahg5,He was shocked to be seen. ,8k9ob3
dz75m1j,He was credited as the vanisher in the credits,8k9ob3

dz771sj,"Dude he shot his past self in the head and splattered that blood all over the green lantern script. To answer your question, yeah but that part felt the most meta. ",8k9ob3
dz6lbja,"there was like 5 people at first screening and they all left immediately after the last scene  and I didn't want to be alone so I just followed, oh well,  was planning on watching again next week anyway",8k9ob3
dz8uu55,"I saw a mid credits scene with Deadpool having Megasonic and Yukio repair Cable's time machine, but he didn't mention what he needed it for that I remember. Was it after all of the credits?",8k9ob3
dzoot78,Fuck. I have to 100% believe that was entirely intentional. ,8k9ob3
e3vhdo4,"I thought the meme was ""in Soviet russia"" not ""in mother Russia"" though?",8k9ob3
dz6e9j1,"That is why Cable called Deadpool ""Buttplug"" a little later.",8k9ob3
dz64w7x,"It would be funny as hell, but I don't see it considering Dark Phoenix takes place in the 90s. But then again, timelines and shit.",8k9ob3
dz64v0u,It's be like when they saw RotJ in Apocalypse and made a jab at The Last Stand.,8k9ob3
dz65x6t,"See I was fully expecting a X-Men cameo in this movie, but the X-Men with James McAvoy and the young X's is set in the 70's....

I fully thought with Cable we'd see some jumping through time and get a flash of Deadpool meeting them in the past for a second",8k9ob3
dz66b1h,Oh God I want this so bad.,8k9ob3
dz8jg1a,That would be so awesome and hilarious!,8k9ob3
dzdnav4,"Do it and never acknowledge that it makes no sense. You know, like they do with their plots in general.",8k9ob3
dz61mjw,I actually found Deadpool to be really noticably greenscreened into the mansion in that scene.,8k9ob3
dz9neer,"It looked pretty fake, honestly. Didn't take me out of the movie, but I could tell they slapped another scene into that room.",8k9ob3
dzaj918,As if Nirvana tees aren't popular now,8k9ob3

dz6r0y5,Assgard?,8k9ob3
dz9m9av,"Thank god Christopher Nolan didn't bill him, or at least I never saw it on the trailers (didn't check the poster hard enough either lol). When I saw him though I knew something bad would happen, but was a pleasant surprise. ",8k9ob3
dzctuqv,He’s gearing up to replace Stan Lee,8k9ob3
dzmxyr5,"I hope he has random cameos in every movie. When he was in Interstellar, I was absolutely shocked.",8k9ob3
dzakde3,There's a pirate on our team? ,8k9ob3

dz76qzt,Same lol,8k9ob3
dzfhfmg,"First time Cable arrives in this timeline, there's two rednecks by their truck and one is talking about toilet papers. Cable teleports behind them and walks to them, asks what year is it, they're like ""What?"", he zap them, they fall on the ground, he takes the beer on the tailgate and closes it. ",8k9ob3
dz76rqm,"I'm not sure, he was one of the two guys. Just means I have to watch the movie again haha",8k9ob3

dzjp4m2,"My husband has met my best friend a total of 3 times. They like each other, but definitely don't talk outside of times when we are all together (which is rare because my best friend is in another state). I know his friends as I see them more often, but I absolutely never see or talk to them unless he's going over there, and even then I mostly talk to one of their wives. They're his friends, not mine. I absolutely would never ever choose them as friends as they are mostly immature and annoying and drink too much, but I say hi to them exactly like the wade, yukio bit. It's just what happens. You don't have to be friends with everyone your partner is friends with, that is very silly.",8k9ob3
dz8cy3h,"Yeah, that's also why it's relatable, because it happens one too many times ""in real life"".",8k9ob3

*You're doing great.*",8k9ob3
dzai9lm,I wish I knew that before he died!! Such a great cameo! Hahaha the whole time I was thinking “why do I know this guy”....,8k9ob3
e4pe3tp,Bill Skarsgård. He's a great guy.,8k9ob3
dzgzl6q,"Well, there was some fake stuff in the IW trailer. Not much, but it was there.",8k9ob3
dzh1x87,"> That would have been an AMAZING surprise.

No it wouldn't. Mark Ruffalo played an important role in the movie. Studio is obligated to put his name in credits and therefore on the poster. His appearance would be spoiled anyway so it's nice that we got a good emotional moment from the trailer.",8k9ob3
dzcgrno,"I mean, I'm sure the actors were in on the joke. We would be hearing outrage from them if they weren't in on it.",8k9ob3
dz9ec4s,Ohhhhh,8k9ob3
dz9smk3,If you had time to watch Deadpool 2 why wouldn't you have time to watch infinity war? It's been out for a few weeks. ,8k9ob3
dz64xri,I liked X-force jumping out of the plane to AC/DC. Pretty sure it was an homage to Iron Man.,8k9ob3
dz6kx85,[deleted],8k9ob3
dz6rosn,[deleted],8k9ob3
dz6to4t,The movie was definitely making fun of the cheesiness of that line. ,8k9ob3
dz6dsw8,[deleted],8k9ob3
dz65hxa,Ouch. That's brutal.,8k9ob3
dzfiita,"Watching it back a second time, it's really not as distinct a reference that I originally thought. The songs are even different. 

However, its Deadpool, and even if it wasn't a ""reference"" it's not like its far from the norm to call it one. Regardless, I laughed my ass off the first time I saw it, and that enjoyment will never be taken from me",8k9ob3
e3yfgvg,THANK YOU! People are working so hard to make connections that they're inventing them where they don't exist.,8k9ob3
dz7mw0t,Ragnarok had Immigrant Song. ,8k9ob3
dz79qqe,"On that note, since I saw Ragnarok only recently: how in the FUCK did they not have Valkyrie smoking people from the air to “Flight of the Valkyries”",8k9ob3
dz92d9f,"The song was *Escape (The Pina Coloda Song)*, not *September*",8k9ob3
dz6lues,"The John Connor joke was pretty good, but Deadpool shooting his pistol in the Terminator theme was excellent-- DUN DUN    DUNDUN 
  DUN DUN",8k9ob3
dz8cq36,"nah, he called him the old man with the winter soldier arm or something like that",8k9ob3
dz6cou0,"Yep, I'm dense. Thanks. ",8k9ob3
dz8534x,And how Thor tried to.,8k9ob3
dz7ed98,Haha it was about as successful for Deadpool as it was for thor,8k9ob3
dz6oks8,"Around the time he asked ""when are audiences going to say enough to the metal arms""",8k9ob3
dzd6f7h,“Calm down Thanos we had a deal.”,8k9ob3
dz99uj4,"I think it was more a reference to Cable's willingness to kill the kid to protect the balance, but it's probably a double reference. ",8k9ob3
dzgd1a7,And what Thor would TRY to calm down Hulk as well.,8k9ob3
dz87ls0,Even Thor uses the same line in Ragnarok to calm down Banner,8k9ob3
e0hc1lx,a Kid asks Jessica if she knew captain America...says that he lost the shield of his captain America's toy....,8k9ob3
dzeae21,It’s truly devastating. ,8k9ob3

dz64btk,">Poor Terry man lol.. 

Terry Crews is the type of person that I beat got a huge kick out the joke.",8k9ob3
dz692hd,I really loved what this movie did with Shatterstar. Best use of the character possible and they even threw a Liefeld can't draw joke in to ice the cake.,8k9ob3
dz7m2ed,"They only showed Peter on-screen, but it’s possible that Deadpool was able to save the rest of the X-Force off-camera when he went back in time.",8k9ob3
dz6ikhe,That would have been amazing.,8k9ob3
dz8dlkn,Same here. I was the only one in my area. ,8k9ob3
e1ehodb,"Holy shit, I didn't even notice.",8k9ob3
dzax8u1,lol,8k9ob3
dz82b1d,That was him???,8k9ob3
dz8jz4s,I watched it again in a clip and it doesn't really look like him even with all the makeup. is there an interview or something somewhere where they mention the cameo?,8k9ob3
dz7ol32,He only saved Peter tho,8k9ob3
dz6ufa0,I know. Half the people in my cinema left at the beginning of the credits. I was offended. ,8k9ob3
dz6c7mg,Umm yeah it is!,8k9ob3
dz699w6,Not very cinematic atleast! ,8k9ob3
dz9bmf9,I’m in love with Zazie,8k9ob3
dz6aaxs,"I think they're sort of setting it up to do whatever they want in the next one. I mean it's a movie where the hero kills his IRL actor, while also signing something as Ryan Reynolds. Anything goes.",8k9ob3
dz6bp4n,"My guess is he went back to save Vanessa, then shenaniganed his way through setting everything up to happen again, only adding in a few small changes.",8k9ob3
dz68392,"""These timelines are so confusing!""",8k9ob3
dz6c3tn,Hi Yukio!,8k9ob3
dzfjast,[removed],8k9ob3
dz69gwu,"I don't know, the whole movie there was a time machine *right there* and at the end of the movie it undid a recent death. I took the first couple of scenes in the credit sequence as silly but canon, and the last couple as ridiculous escalation of the established conventions.

I was kind of mad Cable didn't use it to undo her getting shot and work from there towards the end of the movie that we saw, but with Vanessa alive. ",8k9ob3
dz6du2x,How so? ,8k9ob3
dzfavu8,Welcome to Deadpool!,8k9ob3
dzag46f,Agree. Worst part,8k9ob3
dz98i9u,"But since it only shows us that Peter was saved, does that mean that the rest of X-Force is gone?",8k9ob3
dz6eycs,Black Tom Cassidy.  ,8k9ob3
dz604kl,"Deadpool 2 and the upcoming X-Men: Dark Pheonix were filming at the same time, so I think it was the actors.",8k9ob3
dz60vx0,Their names are literally in the credits. It's them. ,8k9ob3
dz607u5,Was definitely them,8k9ob3
dz6ery0,And certainly cinematic.,8k9ob3
dz73r96,Just watch the Final Destination movies  without the murderous intent.,8k9ob3
dzb526t,“I don’t get it! It’s just not cinematic!”,8k9ob3
dzaypr3,It’s just not cinematic enough.,8k9ob3

Did you not see Colossus shove a rod up Juggernaut's asshole?",8k9ob3
dz9k573,[removed],8k9ob3
dz9kisj,"She can still get battered, yeah, since Cable had the upper hand in their fight. Her luck came in the form of a Deadpool intervention though, which was great. ",8k9ob3
dz62iz3,"Yup. And I hope they don't try to push her into the comics, unless they make her a new character just using the name. I have a soft spot for the super pale, soldier that is comic Domino. 


I read issue 1, and while I like Gail Simone, this was not some of her better work. It was mediocre at best. I probably should check out issue 2 though.

",8k9ob3
dz6coej,What was different about the movie iteration of her?,8k9ob3
dz8hmnz,"You should give Atlanta a watch - for many reasons, including her. ",8k9ob3

dzbcgna,"By all means, elaborate.",8k9ob3
dzan3mr,"WE ALL BOUT TO EAT!

And dude I fucking love that guy. He makes me wanna go out and buy a durag ",8k9ob3
dzftc9i,"Haha yes. 

...though to answer your question, she was born in Germany and her mother was African-American. Kind of the same mix as the Duchess Meghan of Sussex, although  her father is of Scottish descent. ",8k9ob3
dz8r92l,"No he's Spanish. 

And Justin Bieber is black ",8k9ob3

dzlqvwf,https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/au%20naturel,8k9ob3
dzgsw2p,Lol... Well I guess I'll have to be on the look out next time I see it. ,8k9ob3
dza70xm,"Deadpool can be mutilated and blown up and shot and beaten to shit and still live, so we get good two sided action scenes and just don't have to worry about him dying. Domino didn't get a scratch on her the whole movie, I just can't imagine 2 hours of her waltzing through hallways of baddies with them happening to die/kill each other/not be able to kill her would stay interesting.",8k9ob3
dztyhkh,Oh... I thought you were saying the actress had the skin condition... So now you are just upset about a fictional character having a skin condition. ,8k9ob3
dz68jbe,Called the girl who played Domino the N-word. ,8k9ob3
dz6so7t,[deleted],8k9ob3
dz6eekn,It also appears to have been filmed in Canada.,8k9ob3
dz6akmy,"Oh, but don't we?",8k9ob3
dz9o038,"Better than the Charlotte airport, where they have Igor-esque bathroom attendants.",8k9ob3
dz6tnt2,Also Deadpool is apparently from Saskatchewan.,8k9ob3
dznb4cm,"They read comics for BvS, it's just that the only 2 they read were The Dark Knight Returns and the Death of Superman, and the panels were jumbled together. ",8k9ob3
dzgs8cj,Admittedly I have not seen it since it was in theaters.  I should give it a shot again on a rainy day.,8k9ob3
dz6ljkn,"I was just hoping they put the blooper reel in the credit like a Jackie Chan movies.

Also anyone notice the part where Deadpool presents the plan and Cable to the initial X-Force is like a jab to Suicide Squad “This is Katana” scence?",8k9ob3
dza0nua,"Well the funny thing is, in the comics Marvel WAS the dark and gritty publisher while DC had the traditional, clean cut heroes, thanks in part to characters like Cable (and Punisher, Wolverine, Deadpool, Venom etc). ",8k9ob3
dz6dxx6,I don't wanna be fair though. >:c,8k9ob3
dz90uz8,"Intent does not excuse or redeem execution. Scene is still trash, and it being based on a good idea does not change this.",8k9ob3
dzptfqu,I honestly never realized that until now. ,8k9ob3
e0009ep,"hits him riiiight in the ptsd
",8k9ob3
dz7t2xz,"If they hadn’t gotten such a top name, they should have gotten Batista to do the scene. ",8k9ob3
e41al1f,"I didn't notice Brad Pitt either. All I thought was 'wow, Vanisher is really good looking'",8k9ob3
dz66aho,Fight Club trained me for blink-and-you'll-miss-it Brad Pitt sightings.,8k9ob3
dz6r80i,He vanished from the movie ,8k9ob3
dz6qk4x,I don't know. Would they give him his own billing in the credits for just a still frame of him?,8k9ob3
dzb4v20,"Yeah I've never met another human who would describe their relationship with the character of Shatterstar as more than ""aware of""",8k9ob3
dzhw3yj,Dazler and Longshot. Deadpool going to Mojo World would fit so perfectly with so much potential. ,8k9ob3
dzf9e9x,Hold the phone whats wrong with that?! I thought he was hella sick and still do. (To some extent) ,8k9ob3
dz83huu,lmfao,8k9ob3
dzffry7,And ***I’m Batman***,8k9ob3
dzpbx30,"Honestly, it's just another word for queer. It's not such an outrageous word.",8k9ob3
dz8clpk,"We need equality!

Only show white cis-males being killed grrr!",8k9ob3
dz82lj6,Don’t make me sad like this :(,8k9ob3
dz855z0,"Im a 98er and I just guess I was too young when Brad Pitt was so popular to remember his face. 

The only Brad Pitt Movie I remember to have watched is World War Z",8k9ob3
dz7jrhu,Nope. Domino and Deadpool lived. Crews got bussed. The alien dude got helicoptered. Vomit guy got woodchippered. Peter (before redo) got acid vomitted. And Brad Pitt got power lined.,8k9ob3
e08lq2u,What comic is this? I love the art style.,8k9ob3
dzo7q87,"I agree. And I hope that there is a reference to prior Fox trilogies being rather lackluster.

This will be the first one that I've been excited for in a while.",8k9ob3
dzqotnj,Oh so you love sitting right up front and incurring neck trauma for 2 hours? ,8k9ob3
e438sn9,Stupid. ,8k9ob3
dzk6vhh,I do the same thing. ,8k9ob3
dzhfybm,The trailers actually did a pretty good job of not really giving away the plot.,8k9ob3
dzba93x,"Apparently there won't be a Deadpool 3, at least according to Ryan Reynolds. 

Instead it's going to be X-Force from here on out.

",8k9ob3
dz7c2tf,"Hell yeah it's worth celebrating. And that's why I'm worried... Tumblr has a bipolar + borderline personality disorder. First they love and sanctify something, then they hate it and consider it worse than hitler.  

And Negasonic and Yukio are a cute couple. Just let them be.  

But hell, I bet anything that at this moment there is already fanfiction, porn, anti-porn manifestos, appropiation/mischaracterization manifestos, anti-anti porn manifestos, a ""I love Yukio"" blog, a ""I hate Yukio"" blog an ""I hate Yukio drama"" blog and a ""Yukio x Domino"" blog just because.  
Edit: I wonder what part of this post is so polemic people keep upvoting and downvoting 2 days after lol.",8k9ob3
dz98poq,[deleted],8k9ob3
dz9njg7,And gets hotter with age. Just out here living that Marisa Tomei lifestyle. ,8k9ob3
dzbt0po,"And then they spend the entire opening credits lampooning the fact that ""Oh yeah, we went there."" ",8k9ob3
dz96le7,"That's what I was hoping for as the movie went on, but I am also cool with them doing it this way. For now, anyway.",8k9ob3
dzeksgf,Is she?,8k9ob3
dz69lfr,"Well I disagree with that. Their relationship massively motivates his character. She was pivotal to moving the plot forward. Without their relationship, there is no Deadpool 1 or 2. ",8k9ob3
dzmpysp,Not many movies do the crammed in love stories anymore.,8k9ob3
dz7w9qk,Eh. I think it's pretty weak to kill her off just as motivation for Deadpool and I didn't feel it really added anything to the movie. ,8k9ob3
dzbiddg,Killing off a loved one to cause emotional strife in a male action hero is known as pretty hack writing at this point and done to death. ,8k9ob3
dzasada,Dude it wasn't a diss ha! ,8k9ob3
dz63wqf,"Bless, thanks my dude. ",8k9ob3
dz8shkp,oh yea he did remember when Cable changed the timeline so it'd make sense he remembered the lesson too. But does that mean that Russel never learned about his lesson? Maybe DP still went and met him anyway. Guess Deadpool 3 or Ryan Reynolds talking about it will be the only confirmation of those events happened,8k9ob3
dz69zlw,"Which is also why it's important for deadpool to have good writers that understand his character. As some of the comics wth him in are bad, whereas others are amazing. ",8k9ob3
dz7fk01,"> I mean, he has a time machine...

That statement is scarier than any Thanos in IW trailers...",8k9ob3
dz75trr,"It really is! There were two guys sitting behind me in and when the credit sequence wrapped, he kept yelling to his friend ""It's not cannon!"" I also had a guy dressed as Deadpool in my theater.",8k9ob3
e3w6je5,Ya black widow is definitely the least realistic avenger lol,8k9ob3
dz88ess,This is disgusting ,8k9ob3
dzaiepm,T H I C C,8k9ob3
dzgnhhp,He's like the Oprah of pouches.,8k9ob3
dzabyqi,Check the link above. Rob liefeld created the character of Domino yet he is notoriously bad at drawing. ,8k9ob3
dzbbrv5,"To expand on the reply you got, Rob liefeld created deadpool as well. Here's a messy, lazy link for some of the worst of his drawings. He's a terrible artist. https://www.progressiveboink.com/2012/4/21/2960508/worst-rob-liefeld-drawings",8k9ob3
dzgq3l8,Same but I was in a theatre of 5 people. It's a pretty obscure reference though,8k9ob3
dzh0lxf,Same. Sold out theatre. ,8k9ob3
dztf9pb,When was it said in the movie? I must have missed it.,8k9ob3
dzgox1i,Cable in the comics is way more powerfull and has telekinesis as well ,8k9ob3

e056hbl,"Same. Even more contrarily, I want him to come back to DP3. I still like him.",8k9ob3
dz6h1tv,I feel like if anything he’ll be one of the villains but not the main villain ,8k9ob3
dz6n6ex,"And with an Essex establishment destroyed, I think Mr Sinister might make an entrance. ",8k9ob3

dz6hbq0,"Yes, the link the other commenter shared describes it very well, but it's essentially acknowledging that a plot point is ridiculous and then just rolling with it instead of getting bogged down trying to explain and justify it",8k9ob3
dz6g7mh,"I honestly think that they're better off in their own universe away from the rest of the MCU, in the same way that I tend to prefer X-comics that are just about mutants and mutant problems. They definitely wouldn't get as much focus under Disney. ",8k9ob3
dz6l7a0,I just want more without Brian Singer. We got 1 so far.,8k9ob3
dzif09j,"I know that they're different people, but the Yukio in this movie seems to be an amalgam of the two.",8k9ob3
dzzoxv7,I mean Deadpool was basically a C-list hero before the film. That's why Ryan Reynolds could do basically whatever he wanted in the first. Arguably that's why I think the first Ironman movie really worked so well. ,8k9ob3
dz7j9qs,I'm on the fence with Domino because she was really great in the movie but yeah obviously not the comic Domino. At the very least I wish her eye diamond thing was brighter. At the most they could have made her an albino black girl? Maybe that would have been too weird. ,8k9ob3
dz7gbeu,The characters are still great,8k9ob3
dzqwxjc,"Yep, it seems they changed some words instead of censoring. Like ""Can't hear you with that pity duck in your mouth""",8k9ob3
dztuuv6,...,8k9ob3
dzj0ymx,How did they reference it? I don't remember,8k9ob3
dz6svy0,I watched it in Salzburg and people also really seemed to love the Kushner one. Very odd. But it was very funny.,8k9ob3

It's nigh impossible to recreate them completely accurately, especially when the story arc in question includes multiple characters already played by high-profile actors(which means a high casting budget).  In fact, they even frequently toss in easter eggs for the comics fans so that there are references that only they get.


Did Deadpool's burned suit at the end look a little too consistent and undamaged to be burned?  That's because it's a recolor of his suit that he wore in the X-Force series(the team wore black, even Wolverine).


TL;DR: MCU is kind of doing their own thing.  Marvel Comics even prints series that are based on the MCU movies and the Marvel television series.

Maybe people came in to the movie with expectations as to what kind of movie it is and made a judgement based on that? Maybe it’s more of a score comparing it to other superhero movies and not movies as a whole. Maybe people’s definition of entertaining is different or it differs based on the genre/type of movie they’re seeing. Honestly the first Deadpool wasn’t anything mindbending or anything. It was different compared to what was out there at the time. Mostly it was poking fun of the superhero movie that has been crazy popular as of late. I will say it’s the first”parody” (I use that loosely, as DP was already established in comics) movie that I think did I really good job at being a parody. Airplane has the number one spot though.

Colossus shows up at his apartment after it explodes and gathers his body parts in a duffel bag and brings him to the X-Mansion, which is the catalysts that moves the rest of the film along.

dzsl9na,">Logan was not happy at the start of the film, or in any of the films.

False. At the end of the first film and Days of Future Past Logan is shown to be happy from his accomplishments. Not a good way to start your argument.

>Deadpool was never in a state of declining health, he was actively trying to kill himself.

He spends the first half the second act dying of cancer again. So I don't know how you can justify this claim. That suicide montage happened before the declining health part and in the context of my claim is a red herring. You could also compare Deadpool's suicidal tendencies to Logan's alcoholism, so you rebuttal made my position stronger. Thanks for that example.

>The similarities end at that simplistic description.

Except they don't. 

>Except the part where he didn't die at the end

Yes, actually he did die. The fact that time travel was used to reverse that death doesn't mean the death never happened. It was filmed and printed and is IN THE MOVIE. 

>and someone ""slaughtering the people torturing mutant children"" is the third act to half the x-men movies.

It's also the third act of Logan and Deadpool 2. Thus the comparison. 

I blurred neither picture. I merely stated events in both movies that correspond. The opening monologue of the film is Deadpool literally explaining to the audience he intends to rip off Logan because he's sore that Logan rode off the coat tails of the R-rating of the first movie. It was deliberate to fashion the screen play to be like Logan because that was the primary source of satire for the whole film. ",8k9ob3

dz6rf3y,"Also agree. IMO, Guardians 1 is a movie designed to immediately make you care for a large number of ""lead"" characters. They are all strongly archetypal with a nugget of emotional background for you to latch onto. *Just enough* canvas for you to project yourself and quickly relate with any of them. It does a great job at pacing this to prevent whiplash or boredom.

Guardians 2 is a movie geared toward turning a large number of simplistic characters into complex characters. It does this by splitting the large group into pairs for contrast and comparison. The dialogue slowly builds until each character reaches a connection/realization about their own emotional core and the narrative always uses this to strengthen relationships. It does this extremely well, while also tying it into the theme of the movie, which I think is along the lines of "" the blood of the covenant is stronger than the water of the womb."" To me, Guardians 2 sinks it's hooks further without being painful. (i.e. Gamora/Nebula fight like hell up until they take the time to forge a bond through conversation. Ego is biological family, but he sucks. Drax lost his family and hides his pain, while Mantis is incapable of hiding hers, so they bond by finding a center.

Juggernaut is the Embodiment of Irresistable force which means that once he begins to move in a certain direction, nothing can stop him.

I never read any of the comics so i was basing my idea of the movie off of the trailer, which is what they're there for. To give the audience a rough idea of what the movie is about. The trailer went left, the movie went right. Can't deny that. People who knew the source material obviously felt different.

You can compare the two movies when Deadpool has been right up there with all the amazing Marvel (i know) movies that have been made over the years. Deadpool is #3 in my top 5 comic book movies of all time. Infinity War took the top spot from Civil War. Infinity War set the new bar.  I had high expectations for Deadpool 2 and it just didn't live up to it.  Deadpool 2 doesn't compare to the first. It could maybe round out my top 10 or so. 

Again, not saying it's terrible. It was a good movie! Worth the price of admission. Deadpool 1 was a 10, this was like a 7 maybe. We live in an age where everyone judges based on extremes. If you have anything negative to say about anything, it must be you hate every aspect of it. I enjoyed the movie, just not as much as the first. ",8k9ob3

Conservatives make movies as well. 

Not everything is a political conspiracy, you are taking this too seriously. It's a movie where a guy who cannot die has a baby dick for a portion of it, and another guy gets defeated by having a powerline shoved up his ass. I don't think the writers went into this to subtlety push a liberal agenda.

I don’t know if that meant the whole thing (which kinda doesn’t make sense really) or just the part with Vanessa, but the take-away for me was that Vanessa is still going to be alive. Which says to me no “Lady Death” for her. Maybe they’ll make her Copycat for X-Force.

The part that makes this bad for me, however, is that if this is true doesn’t it kind of negate the rest of the story? Her death set the wheels in motion so to speak.

Edit: I have been, pretty vehemently, claiming that scene had to just be a throwaway scene for kicks. Now it seems like it wasn’t, which is weird to me.

Paradoxes aside,  If her living is Cannon (Which it appears to be so)  Then Deadpool should know that he needs to stop fire boy from killling the head master and could use Domino and Cable to help with this.

It even got title of ""best hotel in mississippi of 2016,2015,2014,2013 and 2012.” It honestly is incredibly touching. He changed these people’s lives and fair enough to say he’s made an impact on the city itself. ",8k9ob3

Also, hard to say it’s nitpicky when it’s a HUGE detail. Nitpicky is if someone was complaining about small side details not major characters deaths being reverted. I digress. 
I had the same thought. I found the scene of X-men Origin hilarious and him killing himself before he took on green lantern. But bringing Vanessa back and Peter...literally this movie did not happen then. 
I guess you could argue that Deadpool has gone back clearly with the knowledge of what is unfolding. (Thus he sharpened the butter knife so it killed the guy and knew to tell Gary, I mean Peter to go home). So though on an emotional level currently he couldn’t relate to Cable he had already known him previously and wouldn’t need to reestablish that connection and the rest of the movie may of panned out the same.
Maybe, who knows? If he was traveling all over the place and was going through present time and doing all the things that he had previously would he have done things a little better with the kid from the get go? So the whole issue with Juggernaut would’ve never been a thing?

It does raise some serious, what’s going to be cannon for the next movie? But I think we’ll honestly just have to wait for the next movie to see. ",8k9ob3

Throughout the scenes where he's chasing down the headmaster you can see him toying with him and trying to use his power to inspire terror. The murder at the end would probably just be the moment where he decides he loves using his power for evil. Deadpool or Cable killing the headmaster first would stop that moment from happening, but he would probably go on to inspire more terror with his power and learn to kill anyway.

It was only Deadpool sacrificing himself, even with his power deactivated, that revealed to him how much good he could do. And yes, Dopinder crashing the taxi into him minutes later does kind of render Russell's decision to let him live a moot point, but he's just a fucking wild card. You can't account for that.",8k9ob3

You cannot point to another scene and say it accomplishes something a previous scene needed to, and the second is a more drastic suicide. The the second death is important because it drives the point that no matter what he does he will not die and pass on to Vanessa, and you don't have to have a ticket to the first Deadpool to get into this one. You have to introduce his powers to audiences who didn't see the first one.

Put in some hot girlfriend/family to give the hero some extra drive. Make up a dark backstory with some dead parents or something and you are good to go. 

The jedi are basically the most powerful beings in the star wars universe and their hero kit is made for cinema.

dzbpbqq,"I wasn't arguing for or against why they could or couldn't do it. If anything if it makes money it makes sense to them. However, you have 2 films establishing Deadpool as a brutal, foul mouthed, fourth wall breaking character (yes same as the comics) who plays perfect to an R rated audience.

Even if they rebooted his character (which would likely push Reynolds out of the role), you essentially have to neuter his character. How do you reconcile that with not only fans of his first 2 films but also the hoops you'd have to jump thru in writing to make these wholesome characters (see Spider-man specifically) working with someone who would still likely carry an off screen rep of being a murderer? I just look at it as a superfluous character to add just because ""OMG Deadpool!""

My original point was that looking to the comics for a way to do this is a bit of a stretch because there are so many different books that these team ups take place in you can explain it 100s of different ways. Unless Deadpool flicks start bombing or MCU runs out of character to bring In, which they've shown no signs of being scared to propel lesser known characters to the forefront, it's not a matter of IF but of WHY and HOW? I just don't see Disney associating a character with 2 R rated flicks with their PG13 brand that they are very careful to protect.

Edit: Unrelated, I'd say a gauge of the plausibility of this will come when we see how they integrate Fantastic Four/X-Men into Avengers. I really wonder how they handle recasting Jackman as Wolverine or if they even attempt it. To audiences Reynolds is Deadpool like Jackman is Wolvie. Sure you can put prosthetics on a diet Reynolds and try and make it work, I just don't know how well it will test with someone without Reynolds' charm and deep understanding of DP.",8k9ob3

So anybody that knew about these characters would know some kind of shenanigans was going to go down, at least I did.

It’s why the Morlocks are banished to the sewer cause they physically look different where as Cyclops and Jean can stroll through town until they use their powers then people start to fear them. 

It’s why people say that Wolverine’s hair looks better than Beast’s when it’s the same fucking haircut lol. Lol but no really it’s why Wolverine, a beast in human skin can go out and drink all night at a bar and only be accosted if he starts the fight. While Hank one of the most lovable and kindest x-men who’s a gentleman and scholar but unfortunately looks like an animal wouldn’t even be able to walk through the door without stares or comments. 

Although I think if they were to introduce mutants to the MCU the best way to do it would be the theory where Scarlet witch makes them in a House of M sort of way. Idk what would lead to this. Maybe something after Avengers 4 that has to do with the Skrulls. 

Cause with the Sokovia Accords we know that regular humans aren’t just comfortable with super-powered beings running around unchecked. They were scared when it was a group of 10 people can you imagine how scared humanity would be if out of nowhere a million super powers beings just appeared.

Humans would look around and realize they’re not on top of the pecking order anymore and they don’t do something then mutants will take over.

She was not a blank created to propel Deadpool. She was an interesting and dynamic character. For a writer to 'fridge' means they see no value to female characters except as villain fodder.

Domino herself shoots down this narrative of sexist writers you're created. Cable's wife and daughter weren't characters at all. It could have been a son and had the same effect. It was simply 'lost family'. It placed no judgement on gender.

No one considers Gwen Stacy dying as fridging because she was an actual character.

Death doesn't have much meaning in this movie as Vanessa interacts with and inspires Wilson throughout the movie and has already returned.

There's no big bad villain that made the kill anyways. No one got 'evil points' for the kill which is also a motivator for fridging. It was Wilson's line of work as a whole that did it.

There are so many differences from this to Green Lantern's girlfriend that it blows my mind anyone would equate the two.

Justice League is far more prevalent than X-Force. I feel like you gotta be more into comics to know X-Force. Justice League has been a lot more accessible as far as successful cartoons and whatnot and just more popular characters.

Also dont blame batman fans. The writers are responsible. I personally dont mind as all of batmans victories recently have always come down to his wit and on the spot creativity (and in certain cases the Bat-Family) instead of prep time. The prep time excuse is simply what you get when you create a character that has the means and plans to take down almost every single superhero and villain on and off of the planet. This doesnt bother me aswell as mostly the villains always make it for some reason or another and leave Batman without backup plans. Thats just comics and their biggest problem as a whole really.

We wave off writing issues because the comic itself is poking fun at the more serious titles, and because of that, it's going to inevitably write itself into all sorts of fucked up corners that it can't get out of. Instead of worrying about how it all fits together and fixing the narrative, just enjoy it and let it happen - kinda like the strap-on. ",8k9ob3

It's actually not that simple. Maybe he's fat because he doesn't care about himself in the *same way* as you and doesn't care about traditional ideas of what's attractive. Or maybe he simply has a much slower metabolism and an naturally endomorphic body type. 

And, sure, it is reality that he's fat. That doesn't justify or excuse calling him a 'fat turd'. Doing that is pointlessly rude and says nothing about him as an actor other than he's large, so why even bring it up?",8k9ob3

dz68yig,"The ending to DP2 is besides the point. A rated R superhero movie is nothing new, but in comparison to all these other superhero movies, it definitely gives a badly needed refreshing take. A better critique of the movie is that it’s trying a bit too hard with the jokes and slapstick comedy. But seeing DP’s baby scene is miles more original than seeing any Avenger punching a villain. The DP franchise has a lot more territory to cover than MCU. ",8k9ob3

Frodo and Sam making their way to Mordor, Merry and Pippin kidnapped by Uruk-Hai, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli traveling together to save the kidnapped hobbits.  A pretty cliffhanger ending.

Again, that's what I mean. Just because you point out an issue with your work doesn't make the issue acceptable. Like, if a villain says ""I'm going to do the cliche thing and explain my evil plan now"", that doesn't make the scene any less painful or annoying.

At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter because that's not why people watched the movie. They saw it for the dick jokes, the bloody violence, and pop culture references.",8k9ob3

I also never said anything about other places liking or not liking it, but it is interesting that when mentioning the RT score, you don't mention the 63% audience rating it has.  
  
I'm not even trying to defend the film here, if people want to dislike it that's on them.  But it gets called things like trash and garbage and suddenly I'm using hyperbole for assuming people think of it as bottom of the barrel?  Either these people are being a bit hyperbolic with their descriptions of the film (which was my original point) or they really do believe it's the bottom of the barrel, which is an opinion they're entitled to but whatever the reason, don't act like it doesn't get excessively shit all over here because that's just being dishonest.
