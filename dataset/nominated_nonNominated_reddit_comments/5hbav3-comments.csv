daz0brp,"When a movie makes you cringe hard enough that you have your head in your hands, it's not a good sign.

It's dumb fun that delivers one of those promises: being incredibly dumb. The entire film felt like a giant commercial with memes and David Bowie jokes thrown into the mix. It rehashes pretty much every joke in the ""R-rated party movie"" book, it reeks of corporate advertising (do NOT get me started on the Cinnabon or Kia Minivan ""jokes""), and with most of the jokes being about Tinder, 3D printing your own cock and balls, Snapchat, being PC, Grumpy Cat, Fast and the Furious references and the early seasons of Degrassi: The Next Generation, it's destined to age horribly.

Almost forgot: When Aniston's character is leaving the VIP lounge, she's got a copy of The Girl on the Train. Seems to me like Amblin Partners needed some cross-promotion to boost revenue...",5hbav3

db100oa,"""here's a wild Christmas party. throw in a bunch of comedy actors and let them say lines. make a few sex and drug references, that should be enough""  
the scene that defines this movie for me is when jason bateman and olivia munn get trapped on the roof. nothing happens, they go up there to smoke a joint, are locked and then.... nothing. there is no escalation of their attempts to get untrapped, there is nothing happening that they are desperately missing while stuck, the situation does not get worse and worse, they are just like, ""darn, we are stuck here now"". no comedic tension is built. they sit there, have a serious talk a bit, but nothing to get truly invested in either a comedic or in a non comedic sense, and then are almost immediately let back into the building by a guy opening the door to pee.

dbdvzjz,"I don't really understand why y'all are shitting on this movie. I thought it was hilarious. If you are saying it's dumb, then you had too high of expectations, you should know by the trailer that it's a Horrible Bosses-type of movie. I get it if you thought the jokes were washed up, obviously too many stupid references to snapchat, twitter, and stuff like that, but if you didn't laugh at a couple of scenes, then you deserved to lose your money on a ticket.",5hbav3
db3eal9,"I laughed during this movie but not the best comedy of the year (Nice guys, deadpool and war on everyone are much better). Not going to be a cult classic, but a good chuckle. 

The set ups were predictable and felt like they set up some great characters but didn't follow through too much with what they got up to. Like i'd love to have seen more of what security guard got up to, could have been some nice die hard/rambo gags in there. 

The file was partly about Bateman being too safe, yet the ending of the film felt safe and cliche. Saving the company with an impossible idea and a finale kiss. For a film which was about miserable office workers and tried to break some rules (surprising about of male nudity for a US film) it became pretty upbeat all of a sudden. 

Upside forgot how good Jennifer Andersons comic timing was. Felt like Olivia Munn struggled up against her at pulling off the lines they had. In fact you could remove Jason Bateman and Munns storyline and it would've been better likely more off the leash.  Kate McKinnon was good, her role felt like oen for an older actor but given how the character shifted from being anal safety HR lady to going off to car chases. It's believable because you kinda sense that is in a McKinnon character. Lot of great stand up comics popping up in it if you're into the current scene.

dazc012,"Hammered Hank's Drunk Reviews 1:

Good morning, everyone! Saw this movie after 2 and a half pints of straight Titos Vodka. This movie is basically a long winded version of a what could have been a stellar 10 minutes short/skit. Amazing talent; just nothing for them to do and it just clutters up scenes. Funny moments are sparse with only a couple truly laugh out loud jokes. 

Overall this is the Sensible Chuckle gif in movie form, that's too long for its own good. Save your money and watch all the jokes in a YouTube video 3 weeks from now. Or a 9 pack of 16oz Coors Light twist top cans and a tube of pringles.

A lot of actors just live in New York, have apartments there, or have lots of friends there. So a lot of time, while Actors are between big projects, they'll take small projects in New York.

Everything is shot in New York, there are no sets, and people just bang out scenes quickly in a few weekends while they're doing something else in the area, or while they're waiting for production to start on their next project.

daz00ey,"Here's a review I posted on this sub but it didn't get traction maybe you guys might like it.

I really liked this movie. I'd compare it to The Night Before that released last year. Has pretty funny jokes and a couple of running jokes that aren't overdone. It feels like a mixture of The Night Before and Horrible Bosses but cranked up a couple notches.

This isn't a politically correct movie. You will see genitals, deep throating, mentions of incest, 3D printing of genitals, weird fetishes of people, and much more. All the characters get enough screen time and have their storyline finished by the end of the movie.

The jokes in the trailer are about half of the jokes in the movie but there's still plenty of other good jokes that aren't in the trailer. The relationship between Jennifer Aniston's and TJ Miller's characters felt genuine as any other relationship in real life would. The movie wasn't 100% predictable which I liked but the storyline came in a definite second compared to how characters communicated with each other and how they went through the movie.

Although the story mainly revolved around Bateman's, Miller's, Munn's, and Aniston's characters, Kate McKinnon definitely was also a shining star in the movie. Even though she was a tertiary character, Bateman and Miller being primary and Aniston and Munn being secondary, the way she performed made her a secondary character and by the end of the movie was pretty much a secondary character. Most of the other characters had their own stories going on that didn't mix with the main storyline other than that they wanted to keep their job. Although Aniston's character looks to be the only antagonist, there is another antagonist in the movie that pops up later on which I won't spoil. If you were going into this movie hoping for some secret cameos then I'm afraid you'll be disappointed as almost all if not all the characters have already been introduced in the trailers.

Overall this was a funny movie that I'll definitely watch again but for some of you might warrant more of a RedBox or streaming viewing instead. The movie definitely pushes a hard R rating and definitely couldn't have been a PG-13 without some major changes to the comedy although the storyline wouldn't need any changes as it's a basic cookie cutter plot with a couple of twists. I'll say go see this movie more for the comedy and interactions rather than the plot. A solid B+ movie.",5hbav3
db1hb7z,"I seen this movie yesterday, I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious. It was so much better then I expected. At one point I was actually crying because I was laughing so hard. Some of the jokes are absolutely hilarious. One of the funniest movies I've seen in a very long time",5hbav3

And then the pterodactyl thing picks up a robot, drops it like 50,000 feet, and somehow the guys inside aren't fucking *liquified*.  Very very pretty, but none of how it happened made any sense, just like Avatar.  But because the dialogue and the characters didn't suck, everybody fucking loves it.
