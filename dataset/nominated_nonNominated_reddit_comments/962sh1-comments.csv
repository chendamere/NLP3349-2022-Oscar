But  I liked the parallels of when they first sent him in to see if the black panther guy was going to cause violence  and didnt believe him about them not really being violent.

e3zq6ty,"Tonight Spike Lee had us in the theater applaud Topher Grace performance as David Duke cause he felt he channeled Duke perfectly and gave a fantastic performance that isn’t getting enough credit. 

And he brought up how he knew John David Washington was perfect to cast cause he’s seen him in other things but also cause he’s Denzel’s son. He’s also one of the kids in the end of Malcolm X. ",962sh1
e3xosfu,"John David Washington has his father’s exact gait. I don’t know how else to describe it other than “sinking in to a strut.” Also i think Adam Driver is one of the best young/modern actors. His monologue about “I never thought about it before, but now it’s all I think about.” Was so great, I think he’s the most natural actor around.

This felt like a beautiful mesh between older Do The Right Thing, Malcom X, Crooklyn Spike Lee and later career Inside Man, 25th Hour Spike Lee. It was messy but it was a lot of fun. ",962sh1

Needless to say, the ending was incredibly powerful sitting in the theatre that is a couple of blocks away from Market Street Park (formerly Emancipation Park, formerly Lee Park) and only a few more blocks from 4th Street. I think Spike Lee made his message clear and maybe some think it is over done. But I think he wants it to be **as clear as humanly possible**. White nationalism is not dead, nor is it non-violent. In an attempt to illustrate that the effort of people like Stallworth, he shows that while these people experienced some level of success, these problems are not solved like many seem to think they are.

I'm a white male, but just sitting through that scene made me tear up seeing the reactions of these people who  honestly at the time didn't think they were worth anything and having a person up stage so passionate and raw saying they are beautiful was in fact beautiful to watch.

I know problems are still going on today, but I honestly hope everyone is able to take the time out their day and understand their worth and what they bring to the people around them. Power to all the people. ",962sh1

 It seems like all the calls were just basic stuff and didn't require any particular skills that Ron had that Flip wouldn't have. ",962sh1
e49f02q,"From the trailer and the beginning of the film, I thought this was going to be pure dark comedy. I was cracking up when Ron was being questioned on joining the CSPD and, after asking if any other officers would really discriminate against him, the man on the right started a long and drawn out ""Sheeeiiiitttt."" That and Alec Baldwin's messing up his opening speech were hilarious. 

But then things got serious, and I found myself laughing less and grabbing my leg more. The lead up to the climax with ""Ron"" being discovered and the C4 being placed was madly tense. 

I wasn't enthralled by the ending, which -- despite being satisfying -- was *too* satisfying. It was Disney Channel-perfect, where everybody got what was comin' to 'em! I was glad to see the racist cop go off in handcuffs in front of a bar full of applauding undercovers, but I found myself wondering if that *really* happened. If it did, then fantastic, but I'm more inclined to believe it was an optimistic embellishment. 

Following Ron's celebratory ""Screw You"" to David Duke, I was ready to leave my seat, satisfied; following the footage from Charlottesville, I chose to stay seated. The 10 second silence between the final footage and the credits were deafening. All I could hear was my ears ringing. I did eventually get up and leave, but in a much more somber mood. I've thought a lot about this film, the events it depicted, and how I would react to those the events.

e3xlowb,"About as subtle as a sledgehammer - but sometimes, that's what's needed. Spike is back on form and you can tell he's incredibly fired up here. 

The coda to the film is something that, on paper, sounds ham-fisted, but in context I found it quite powerful - you could hear a pin drop in my theater right before the cut to the credits. And that's a feat, considering the preceding two hours were generally broadly comedic. But it serves as a powerful reminder that as unbelievably idiotic as the villains of the movie seemed, they caused and continue to cause very real harm. 

The cast is pretty good across the board. John David Washington gives a solid, charismatic lead performance as Ron. Adam Driver is building himself one of the most interesting resumes of any young-ish actor out there and Topher Grace is surprisingly great. ",962sh1

e9b3lay,"I really didn't know what to expect from this. I have never seen a Spike Lee film before. I know the critics and audiences loved it, but I honestly wasn't super interested in it. And WOOOW. I was blown away by this film. It is so fucking good. 

It is a gorgeous film to look at and the actors' performances were top notch. What a cast!

I understand why some might see the end with the real footage a little corny and unnecessary, but personally I loved it. I loved how heavy handed, in your face, and unapologetic it was. It was very powerful and effective. I broke down crying and I'm not even American. (Asian, born and raised in Philippines) I cannot even begin to imagine how Americans felt during the end of this film. It was heartbreaking. It's very disappointing that we're (as human beings) still dealing with these backwards kind of thinking.

This is clearly made for American audiences, but even as an outsider I really appreciated and enjoyed this film. I will definitely check out Spike Lee's other films now cos this was phenomenal.",962sh1
e3xea5x,Hands down one of Spikes best movies. Great to see the Dolly camera shot back. ,962sh1
e4twsdc,"Great movie I was very impressed...but I wasn't impressed with the main character at the end.

Ron why would you reveal your REAL IDENTITY to the leader of the KKK, knowing your address is listed in the phone book as mentioned earlier in the movie?! All he did was open a can of worms as seen at the end with the cross burning.",962sh1
e3y8dnj,"Unapologetic and surreal. Washington and Driver were excellent in their leading roles. 

The whole film had this very ""cool, yet uncomfortable"" tone going for it, which drew me in early on and held my attention throughout.

Spike Lee manages to balance the humor, tension, and emotion near perfectly. That ending sequence...damn was it powerful. My entire theater was dead quiet as the flag faded to black and white.",962sh1
e4atkn4,"The ending was powerful as fuck. My theater was so damn quiet afterwards.

I liked how they decided not to shy away from the language used. It had a lot of moments of levity but also balanced it out with real seriousness when it called for it.

Corey Hawkins appearance as Kwame Ture was great. He gave one hell of a speech. I'm Asian and still felt that.

A lot of Spike Lee's trademarks are there such as dutch angles, the dolly shot, the fourth wall breaking/talking to the camera, the insertion of real footage, etc. So if you're a fan of his style, I think you can find something to like.

I feel like the movie could've been trimmed down a bit though. Some scenes IMO went on for far too long. Sometimes the stakes didn't feel high enough though. For example, [When Flip says he has a sick father in Dallas and not El Paso. A lot of the slip ups were explained away and kinda accepted with ease from the Klan members. This may have been how it played out in real life though?](#spoiler) 

All in all, it has pretty relevant messages and parallels to today, is pretty funny and well acted for the most part. While I liked it, I'm not sure I'd urge people to see it though.",962sh1
e50w0c6,"Loved the movie, and it really got me at the end, the first movie to ever bring me to tears.

I'm fortunate enough to have lived my life with friends and family from all different background without really experiencing any racism first hand. Throughout the movie I kept thinking how absurd it was that people like this used to exist and then that ending hit me hard that there are so many people like that.",962sh1
e3ztpn1,"I'm hearing a lot of people say that they thought the ending montage was tacky and unneeded, but looking back at the movie I think it was needed because it ties everything to modern day. Without the ending montage, then the dramatic irony of a lot of the lines (America First chant, David Duke wanting to Make America Great Again, Ron believing there will never be a president that emboldens racists) would feel out of place.",962sh1
e3xohf0,"Favorite scenes:

1) The white power chant contrasted with the black power chant. Some “In good faith” white people point to the black power chants to show that minorities are the one who have the “us versus them” mentality, and why can’t they respond with their own white power chant. That scene is fucking why. One stands for white supremacy. The other stands for solidarity back against black boys and girls who were lynched by those same white supremacists.

2) “We have thick lips, wide noses, nappy hair, black skin, and we are beautiful.”

3) The way they tackled “America First”. A lot of Trump’s code words have pasts that are tough to convey. This conveyed it. 

4) “America would never elect David Duke.” “Why don’t you wake up?”

5) “You wanna see my big Jew dick?”

6) Ron’s first conversation with the Klansman recruiter. 

7) “Are-uh you sure?”

8) Not a feel-good moment but the initial scenes where Driver has to prove he’s just as racist as any of them were so deeply uncomfortable, which was likely the intent. 

Lastly, A. O. Scott’s review is [masterful](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/movies/blackkklansman-review-spike-lee.html)",962sh1
e3ztvcg,"I fucking **loved** it. As a historian, gave me that after movie buzz to fact check it. Obviously, there are multiple points in the film created to add tension that weren't ""true"" (Flip being of Jewish descent, Ron dating a leader of the black movement, telling David Duke it was him then vs 2006) but they all added to the film.


And then the *sledgehammer* dropped.

...and I was smiling the entire time. I was ecstatic that the audience had completely shut down to absorb the finale. A ""do I have your attention?"" Mic drop. I liked how Spike Lee saw it as a teachable moment. Our audience was applauding during the phone call scene. Could have ended it there for laughs and a happy feeling in the audience. **But he didnt**. He tied it in with reality to show how history isnt a fact sheet or a timeline, but something that continues to influence our society.

e3zo973,"people in my theater were audibly crying at the end footage of the film. it was dead quiet, i’ve never seen the end of a film have people stuck like that

e8m0d1v,"I don't cry easily, but that elderly Blackman telling the true life story of what happened to his friend made me tear up. To think that similar lies lead to the vicious death of so many innocent Black boys at the hands of those monstrous savages, including innocent 14 year old Emmett Till, especially when that horrible spawn of Satan confessed to what we already know to be lies, just like in the old days...oh wait!, another she devil told the same lies against a nine year old Black boy just weeks ago, and a cop went into an innocent Black man's home and shot him dead. 

Goes to show that not much has changed after all these years. Black people are nowhere near angry enough for all the injustice that still happens to date.",962sh1
e3zubyq,"I saw this tonight and think it's one of the most important movies this year. I really don't see a lot of Spike Lee films, not on purpose, I just don't know if he's involved with the movies I see or not, but this one really delivered its message well. It could be heavy handed at times, but sometimes you need a hammer for people to understand.  
  
I hope all the leads get recognized for this come awards time. It would be great if Topher Grace got some recognition for his role as David Duke. He really did a great job. The supporting actors were great too. Jasper Pääkkönen was a believable asshole white supremacist suspicious of Flip, The acting prowess is all over this film.  
  
My theater cleared out extremely quickly at the end. I purposely sat behind to watch everyone leave and they left like they were in a sudden rush. I think this is hitting all the right triggers and making people uncomfortable for the right reasons.  
  
It was mentioned here already but the contrast of the ""White Power!"" and ""Black Power!"" scenes was great, the showing of Birth of a Nation and its reaction from the people watching it, and the ending with Charlottesville, and many more were necessarily awkward and tough to watch.  
  
I believe I made the right choice in which movie to watch this week.  
  
EDIT: Spelling correction.",962sh1
e3zlymg,"I just left from seeing the film in Brooklyn and Spike Lee did a Q&A. It was pretty cool. The main thing I got from it though was that his really wanting Harry Belaronte for the role and after it was offered to him he had to ask his doctors to do it. They said he needed rest so they had him film on the last day of filming and Spike made all the crew on set wear suits (men) and dresses (women) out of respect to Mr Belafonte. 

He had a backup actor in case Belafonte didn’t do it but since “Mr B” did he said we will never know the second legendary actor who was the backup. 

He also spoke about his time at NYU and REAL Rock n Roll music (he said fuck Elvis, it wasn’t him). He also said why he used Gone With the Wind and Birth of a Nation in this film. ",962sh1

e3xr8za,"That was the most uncomfortable I think I've ever been during a movie. 10/10. Probably my favorite film of the summer.

Just to highlight my most uncomfortable moments:

The cops pulling over Patrice

The shot with the shooting targets all turning out to be black men running away (They looked like little kids, which made it worse)

The KKK meeting where they're all watching Birth of a Nation and cheering

When Ron gets tackled by the police and the woman who planted the bomb yells rape and that Ron should be put in jail

The shot of the burning cross outside of the apartment window at the end

The montage of recent events like Charlottesville and having to rewatch the footage of that car driving into a crowd of people.

Not to mention all of the racial profanites",962sh1

e4suwj0,"Many of us were crying as it ended. I felt like I got punched in the face and leaned hard on the guard rail on my way out. I had to walk the city a little bit to clear my head. 

It subverted the happy ending cliches with the uppercut. Here's our moment of triumph with our hero. Here's what amounts to a modern day social media post where everyone feels great about the clever stuff you said, but the Klan is still out there and and in 2018 the same crap is happening. 

I think the point is there isn't any defeating a thing that is systemic. The main character thinks that he can make a difference and change things from the inside, but this is a conspiracy that has been running since the Civil War ended. This is the way it is designed. The people at the top of America will never allow anything more than token victories. 

Spike didn't spare White Women either. The women implicitly support the situation throughout. She eggs on her husband and cuddles him in a very motherly way, is a full co conspirator in every way and then tries to claim she was raped and plays the victim. After the boys have their little racist club meeting with the ritual of initiation there are the women. Like. Grats guys here's your sex for being good racists. 

Spike doesn't really go easy on the Black liberation movement and draws direct parallels. The problem with trying to arm up and equalize to the Klan is that the cards are stacked in their favor. You can give the same speeches and carry the same guns but the Klan has the government to shut down any real efforts. The cards are always stacked in their favor. It's is the endpoint of White Privilege. 

The entire point of the KKK wearing the hood is that it could be anyone. Don't think we are supposed to know who it is. The Civil War didn't defeat the Confederacy it just put those hoods on. All the violence from the War to the Black Liberation movement to the car full of racists being blown up doesn't mean anything. America is most home to racists and there will always be more. 

Making America Great Again is making it racist again. Spike sorta bludgeoned us with it at the end but its a topic that needs to be blunt. You can almost feel the director reaching through the screen shaking us exasperatingly to wake up. 

Smart, important film making, and I hope it means Spike is ready to use his voice more often because kids these days need to know him as more than just the dude courtside at Knicks games. ",962sh1

Some great cinematography but I just don't the way some scenes progressed. Like yeah those racists assholes blow themselves up but the whole scene seems tonally jarring. It kind of just happens and everyone is so happy and then they arrest the racist cop like it's a silly sitcom. The FBI meetup scene was also strange.

The Kwame Ture speech was cool acting and powerful but it went on WAY too long and felt too on the nose. Obviously Spike Lee has his beliefs but he'd be much more effective at not blatant pandering.

Overall the tone is just off. The movie is interesting but it could've been much more.",962sh1

This is one of the most powerful movies I have seen this year. And here's my technical gushing of this movie: the 35mm photography of this movie is GORGEOUS AS HELL! I felt like I was watching a movie from the 1980s or the 1970s.

Did the audiences in the theater applauded and cheered when >!Ron Stallworth reveals to David Duke on the phone that he was a guy who not only bodyguarded him but also planned this undercover investigation with Flip?!<

And by the way, that police officer who looked like Steve Buscemi? He's played by his brother.",962sh1

e4rxjrs,"Seeing lots of people speculating about the identity of the hooded klansman at the end of the film, and whether it was Flip or the police chief or something.

Does it matter? This is based on historical events, so having a huge reveal/twist/cliffhanger at the end would be pretty senseless. I don't think we are going to have a BlacKkKlansman 2.

So here's my read - the hooded guy illustrates the persistent threat of faceless, anonymous racism, which coalesces in the horrifying events of Charlottesville. And of course, the blunt point that its not just the David Duke's and Donald Trump's of the world that can hurt people: it's an asshole in a car or a coward hiding under a hood.",962sh1
e5b9cqd,"I watched it yesterday. I am from Switzerland, and the room was packed with people. 

I liked the subtle references to Trump throughout the movie like ""Make america great again"" or ""America First"". We as an audience had a really good time, then the ending scene came. As we're not from the US, it was pretty strange to see that similar things still happen today. 

When the movie ended it was pretty surreal. I've never experienced a completely silent room after a film ended. Everyone sat still and made no noise at all. You could feel how uncomfortable everyone was(In a positive way). 

Really liked the movie. ",962sh1

Only scene I thought didn't work was the scene where they finally get that racist cop with Patrice there and everything and she's weirdly buddy buddy with the entire force and they're the same way with her.

Before heading in, the gentleman ripping tickets and looked at me and my friend, sighed, and told us that this is such a powerful film and that all the people who should be seeing it are not. We didn't know what to say, so we said thank you and have a good evening. After the credits started rolling, it was dead silent, and no one said a single thing as we left the theater. Lee's message, especially with the ending montage, may or may not have resonated with everyone in the theater, but it definitely was sobering, shocking, and a necessary e for everyone who just thought they were getting a buddy cop film. As my friend and I left, the gentleman who ripped our tickets asked what we thought, and we were speechless. What an excellent film, it's thought-provoking, tense, hilarious, and one of the most powerful films I've seen in recent years. ",962sh1
e8o9hba,"I really enjoyed the movie. I thought some of the Trump jabs were a little too ""wink wink look at the camera"", but I imagine that in a few years the connotations will wear off and people won't notice at all. Except maybe the casting of Alec Baldwin. I've never watched SNL, but I know that those bits stick around.

I originally expected the movie to be a sort of Chapelle bit with Ron Stallworth walking around in a KKK hood the entire movie. Looking back on it I feel like a moron, but I prefer to go into good movies blind, so I didn't know anything more than the title of the movie and whatever headlines popped up. Though, there were a surprising amount of humor, and they managed to make it work despite the heavy subject matter.

I really enjoyed how the relationships between the detectives evolved over time. The performances were great. And as a guitarist I have to commend the soundtrack. You don't hear solos like that much anymore. 

The movie also did a great job at tension. I'm not sure why, but I felt more tensed up during the birth of a nation / killing of Jesse than I did at any other point during the movie. That was some great direction.

Flip HATED spending any time with the KKK. He mentions that he started reflecting upon his Jewish heritage because of the experience and I can't see Lee throwing in a 180 on Flip's own small arc of self reflection.

The screenplay has some rough moments and was my biggest critique.

I am not an Adam Driver fan by any stretch, but he delivered the goods for his role. The balance of comedy and serious was well done for the most part, but I could have done without the KKK and black power speech parallel (thought it lingered too long here). Turturro as a klansman was a little bit of an odd casting choice because he's 'tanned'.

e4hv0cm,"Question: I've seen people bring up the ending (before the Charlottesville coda) with the cop being arrested as too happy/feelgood. I had a different read on it though. 

Before the scene, when Ron is asked to stop investigating the KKK, he seems to have a small crisis of conscience, but decides to stay at the precinct and stick it to David Duke with his fellow cops. I read that as him giving in, the sense of duty and family was too hard for him to turn down. Later on, when Patrice confronts him about it, saying she can't date a cop, they're interrupted and it transitions into the Dolly shot reminiscent of the Blacksploitation film posters they were discussing earlier. Patrice earlier suggested that those movies about black hero cops are fiction, it's not a reality.

Was that another layer of ambiguity, suggesting that maybe her argument holds water, that there aren't really ""black hero cops"" in a racist system?

Edit: [Boots Riley](https://twitter.com/BootsRiley/status/1030575674447212544) vehemently disagrees with me.

Edit2: I think where I split with people is I saw the ending with the Duke call, the bust of the racist cop, everything tied together with a bow, as purposefully unrealistic. Maybe I'm giving Spike Lee too much credit, but I can't see what other purpose Patrice's comments on Blacksploitation films would serve.",962sh1

Every group knows that there are lots of hwhites who are intentionally in denial, often by hwhites who are all too aware of their privileges and are petrified of losing it. 

The film showcased a great portrayal of the Black group still fighting to earn the right to walk down the street without fear of harm or death towards themselves and their loved ones from the public servants meant to protect one and all, against the hwhite group with hatred in their hearts, the hwhite group s still yearning for the days of slavery; willing to go to the extent of great harm and kill every other demographic that contributed to building the nation. 

Living in a world in the year 2018 and being ruled by a president who actively enables racist hate groups. A world where hwhites reap the benefits of slavery and still continue to have more opportunities than any other demographic, even greater than the indigenous natives could ever hope for, but still crying fragile tears of being hard done by; while stating everyone else should remain silent for complaining about being oppressed. 

The only people who will find these film uncomfortable are those with the same hwhite fragility mindset.

e40pno8,"I wonder why Spike Lee chose not to show how in real life the Klan were planning on bombing the two gay bars that opened. The Klan acknowledges one of the bars but in real life they were planning on bombing the bars and stealing automatic weapons from Fort Carson. 

Also, the Klan in the 70s didn’t focus only on Jews and Blacks. That was the Klan of the past. They were still their two biggest enemies but after the influx of Hispanics in the 40s-60s they were a big target for them also. In the 70s the Klan targeted Jews, Blacks, Gays, Hispanics, Asians etc. and hated the Irish and Italians etc. also.

e5xqbh9,"After a 2nd watch, I agree with a lot of /u/dr_gonzo_13’s views. I wish spike could have trusted the audience enough with the main storyline to not have to be so heavy-handed with the Baldwin intro and the Charlottesville footage.

The main takeaway is a powerful message: The impact of Racism continues to be damaging in our society and must not be taken lightly. Judging by the surprise reaction to the charlottesville events, maybe we, as a society, need to get the message forced to us continually. Sadly, though, the ones that need to see this message are not the ones who will be watching the movie. And, ultimately, I think that’s why I would have preferred a more subtle comparison of past and present. Subtlety is rarely allowed in a Spike Lee Joint, however...

Aside from Lee’s depiction of the evolution of racism over the 70 years, I did enjoy the movie. There were great performances from all, led by revelatory performances by Washington and Harrier.  My two favorite scenes were the “imitation of Ron’s voice” scene in the interrogation room and the scene where Ron sees just what the KKK members were shooting at. 

There were some narrative quibbles I found confusing, though, such as the introduction of ‘Flip’. He was just “there” without a backstory for why he was there. Also, his name is never revealed until the end, I guess, for dramatic purposes. Since the Jewish background was created for the movie, it seemed unnecessary to withhold that information until the end.

All in all, though, I feel like it was still in my top 10 of the year (currently #6). Powerful message, great soundtrack, great performances.

Overall the film wasn’t perfect, I felt like the movie was trying to strike the balance between being light hearted and heavy at times, sometimes it worked really well, others it just didn’t.

I was expecting a downer ending with the protags losing, and I guess in a way they did, but their earlier victory in nailing that racist cop, and the bomb part were exactly what I wanted to see.

I left the film eager to watch the creators other works, and maybe rewatch Do the Right Thing. (My problem with that film was the audience was given a choice- do you support the 2nd generation immigrants trying to make a livelihood or a man that goes around causing trouble. My family are immigrants so I strongly sided with the workers trying to make an honest living, as I’ve had relatives targeted by locals so much that they ended up in destitution. But alas). 

I guess I also thoroughly enjoyed it as I truly dispise racists. A world without racists would be brilliant. If we woke up tomorrow and every racist was summoned to hell prematurely/vanished/abducted by aliens the world would be a better place. Imagine that being your lot in life - a mess that’s in the way of decency that only offers ruination onto our planet.

I was really impressed by how complicated Spike Lee's position ended up being when given the subject material. He goes way beyond ""these people are racist and therefore bad"" and instead tries to pinpoint the misguided fears and bigotries that bond them together, while critiquing the encouragement of racially-based power of any kind. 

The KKK members didn't come off extremely cartoonish, and their racism was fearfully casual at times. The scene with Alex Baldwin in the beginning to me emphasized how many people preaching these beliefs aren't feeling that hatred 24/7, or even as they spew it.

I think even attempting to parallel the KKK ceremony and the Black Student Union meeting is a minefield because of the implications if failed, but this navigated it very well and got across that segregated empowerment, even when done in an positive way, can be a slippery slope. When Patrice rejects Ron at the end of the film because of her preconceived notions of police officers, I thought this brought this viewpoint home well. And even then, Spike Lee still keeps her perceptions in relative check when compared to the backwards beliefs and actions of the KKK.

Ivanhoe also gets some laughs from being very dimwitted.

I was questioning if John David Washington(who did a terrific job) is Denzel's son because their speech cadence can be rather similar at times. I looked it up and indeed he is the man's son. Adam Driver did good as usual especially with is comedic timing; it felt a lot like his Kylo Ren Undercover boss video. Jasper Pääkkönen though did such a good job in his villainous role. You really believe the hate that this man embodied.

i think for the past few years any movie that is considered ""socially responsible"" or progressive gets overrated by critics. maybe critics want to be seen as ""woke"" and sensitive to traditionally underrepresented groups of people but any time there is a movie about gays, empowered women, black equality, or transgenders it feels like critics shut down their critical faculties and are more enamoured with what the film stands for than the actual craft involved.

i thought the use of juxtaposition was executed masterfully — it totally made the film tie together beautifully. my fav scene had to be the one that placed the klansmen in the imitation ceremony chanting “white power” next to the gathering of those chanting “black power”.  

this was a great commentary on several minority experiences, obviously the most striking being that of the life of a black person in america, and the negatives that can come along with it

Speaking of that ending. It was some powerful ass shit. I loved this movie. The scene where Ron is getting arrested while that white woman is screaming literally had my heart pounding out of my chest. I didn't think she was able to get the bomb in the car so I thought it was gonna explode next to Ron and Flip. But it didn't. Thank God. Maybe I just misread the scene but I feel like Spike Lee did that on purpose. 

I also think Topher Grace was excellent as David Duke. He really captured the guys' mannerisms well and everything. John David Washington was amazing as Ron. And Adam Driver just kicks ass in everything.

e4039wv,"So I live in Charlottesville but I moved here four months after the events of last year. I also work at a movie theater in town. Also, while this was one of the few movies I wanted to watch before working it, I wasn't able to, but I was able to pay attention to most of it, and watched it three times while working.

I loved the humor in it, and felt like the material would have been difficult to digest without it. Driver and Washington were hilarious and it became easy to forget the subject matter. But that also made me reflect on it more- the characters are well rounded and I thought it was important that Lee emphasized the love between moustache guy and his wife, and that Duke and the local klan leader were very trusting of Ron, either Ron. But every touch of humor made me check myself, and the emotions displayed by the klansmen made me sad. Every time Driver said something comically prejudiced, or one of the klansmen said something stupid, the audience laughed, but sometimes I wondered if it was almost too emphatically.

That seemed to me to be an underlying current throughout. It's funny, but not as funny when you consider that the people being joked about could be real people. And, as illustrated by the ending, still exist. They're a joke in the same way Washington thought the idea of a racist president is a joke.

I read a comment saying that the parts of the ending with the cross burning and the Charlottesville footage implied that things can't change from within the system. I disagree with that, assuming that the entertainment industry and social media at large help constitute the system. The point of the movie is made through the fact that it took place long ago, and yet these sorts of people remain. Nothing has really changed, at least people haven't, and the best way to fight it is to show how it works. That someone isolated can become hate, and that culture and religion are commonly used to divide us. And most importantly to me, that most people in this nation are developed enough to judge people on character.

The end scene where Washington records the crooked cop and is validated by four or five of his peers, that says to me damn yes we can change it within the system, most people in this country evaluate our peers on non-prejudiced terms, and we're foolish if we think otherwise.

Another note about the ending. I do not think it was heavy-handed or unnecessary. Before the movie began there were two trailers for movies pertaining to police violence against black people set in current times. For good reason there will be quite a few movies coming out this year pertaining to that. But this movie began with the past, and through the conduit of Duke, helps us understand how the past is the present. And that we can not disillusion ourselves about the racism that exists within our current society. But also that it exists in the minority and can be defeated through community, speech, and art. Not to say that the other films don't have their place, just that I appreciate the way it was illustrated historically.",962sh1
e40yudo,"I thought it was entertaining. Very emotional at the end. I’d watch it again. I’d recommend everyone watch it. If people don’t care for the things going on in the movie and real life, then  it’s  at least worth watching to see how Denzel Jr and Kylo Ren do in other roles.

e4fnyru,I was not prepared for that ending. Goddamn what a punch in the gut.,962sh1
e3ymgmx,"Absolutely powerful, moving film. Probably my favorite of the year so far. Here's why:

I really liked how the film engages with the naïve idea that racism is simply a distant relative of our past, instead showing us that such hate and violence are reoccurring characters of life in America. 1916. 1979. 2017. More than a hundred years and such virulent hate persists.


I thought the juxtaposition between retelling of the KKK's rebirth and lynching of Jesse Washington in 1916 and the initiation of new Klan recruits in 1979 was profound. As the Black Student Union listens to what happened in the past and what should remain there and only there, the film shows us how it's playing out in ""new but old"" forms of organized violence as the KKK in their very town plots for their destruction. And in turn, while the audience sees a retelling of what happened in 1916 and 1979, Spike Lee adds footage from present day, as we recognize familiar symbols and words, and unfortunately familiar acts, showing us what is happening in our very towns, to our ruin. (I could think about this meta-commentary for hours, and about Spike Lee's unique position as the storyteller.)

What the Black Students' Union could not see until it was too late (in terms of the actual bombing), Spike Lee reveals what is happening before our very eyes, reminding us exactly what's going on, right in front of us, in the most public office, on the world's stage. He makes it clear that there is a  real, pervasive threat to non-white America that persists and does not simply go away. In fact, the events of today are a triumph on part of the hateful, as the film even foreshadows the openly racist agenda and ambiguous moral leadership to come, during the exchange between Ron and Sgt. Trapp, to which Spike Lee ends the film with a American flag in distress. Really well-done and powerful.

Other things I noticed and liked:

I loved the montage of faces of the Black Student Union during Kwame's speech. I think showing actual, young people's faces as his words rang out
really made them impactful and once again reminded us that for every attitude and act promoting hate and violence, there is a human being, often a black individual in America that is being silenced, killed, and destroyed.

I loved the interactions between Ron and Flip. Particularly toward the end, when Ron is being arrested by the police, and Flip explains the situation and Ron is released, only for Ron to say, ""You're late."" I took this to show us that although Ron was doing his job and acting right, it's through the failure of others (and so becomes their responsibility and duty) that these injustices are all too common. Something as benign as being late or not paying attention can get a minority killed. (Also on a less serious note, this is a nice callback to Ron being repeatedly late and keeping Flip waiting.)


There's a lot more I could say that I liked about this film, but I'll end here.",962sh1

e4buslm,"Plagued by in-fighting about optics, the divided ethno-nationalists offered a laughable presence in DC last Sunday. It seems they're facing an existential crisis that can no longer be mended by rallying around their dear leader. And somehow that fact seems to deflate Spike Lee's urgency in BlackkKlansman.

This movie made me want to re-watch I Am Not Your Negro. The dynamics and tension of the liberation movement was better articulated by James Baldwin, as was his righteous anger. You really get a large view of his mode of thinking which I found more satisfying than the few lines of reflection that the (phenomenal) actors had to work with in BlackkKlansman. I enjoyed the movie but it had many technical issues and narrative weirdness that detracted from Lee's message.

Don't get me wrong, there are some great scenes that really drive home the moral imperative of eradicating white supremacy. The visual celebration of black beauty was effectively blended with Stokely Carmichael's speech encouraging young black folks to not be ashamed of their physical features. The juxtaposition of one group shouting white power while the other is shouting black power, out of context, could lead people to believe that both are merely different sides of the same hate coin. Lee is aware of this false dichotomy and he guides the viewer convincingly by cutting between a retelling of a brutal lynching with a baptism of the next generation of Klansman. 

But it becomes so overt that by the final act it's less of a story about characters navigating the tumult of the fascinating circumstances they're in, and more about propaganda. Which is fine, I guess. AO Scott praised the film for being a provocative conversation starter, which it may be. But last weekend's pathetic turnout to the Unite the Right 2.0 rally indicates that Americans are already having this conversation. Who will this film really convince? To that, I think Get Out is a more effective film for showing unsuspecting white folks the impact of behaving with no regard to their own relationship to power. 
",962sh1
e5u5xw3,"I felt this movie delivered it's message in a clumsy way and actually needed the recent real life images to deliver it's point.

This movie is based on a true story. Wich led me to believe it would be an accurate retelling of this story with a clear message about the race issues going on in the US. Great premise ! But this is not the case in my point of view. There's quite some stuff made up to make the narrative more dramatic than needed and a some character interaction felt quite over the top and unrealistic to me.  The sparse humour and pop culture references didn't always fit in well. So there's a weird mix of tones in the movie and it doesn't settle on one particular approach wich makes it harder to relate to. 

The portrayal of the KKK members versus the portayal of the Black Liberation movement members put me off. KKK members where probably portrayed reasonably realistic as less intelligent alcohol abusing gun lovers, but the Black Liberation movement members where all beautiful thin well dressed people with noble hearts. Maybe this was intentional but it felt unrealistic and maybe even capable of evoking a polarized response with the viewer (wich is not in line with the message the movie tries to convey).

The Charlottesville ending was very powerful but those images are powerful by themselves. They don't need the two hours that came before them. Wouldn't it be way better if the film itself managed to leave this powerful impression without the need to use recent real life events like done in American History X for example ?",962sh1

The good guys are really good and righteous, the bad guys are really bad and evil. It's too 2d. The african americans are nearly all models, the white americans are scrawny, unhealthy looking or overweight clowns.

It's a feel good movie for most of us because it aligns with our own world views or politics, but its so crudely drawn and propaganda like that I really don't want much to do with it.

The scary thing about racism whether its in nazi germany or southern america, isn't purely the hate, it's the mundaneness of it. Racists aren't the pathetic cross-section of humanity this film presents them as and african americans aren't the attractive, uncomplicated and pure hearted group of people portrayed either.

The movie is pointed in the right direction, but its lost of the interesting features of reality and replaced them with this overly controlled, reduced picture of what happened and what is.

As someone who does keep up with politics and has seen the Charlottesville footage, I felt lots of jokes and comparisons were very on the nose, and the ending spoon fed the message to the audience. The story itself was not too crazy or unbelievable, and I enjoyed Washington and Driver's acting and chemistry. ",962sh1
e49z41e,"So, judging how the movie plays, I think he botches the tension near the end. In fact, the way a certain scene is edited makes it seem like Felix CAUGHT the two Ron Stallworth's by calling him on the phone, and it seems like he's looking at Ron outside at the same time. So the immediate feeling was ""OH SHIT"" and something was fixing to go down, right there.

But it pulls back and reveals that the phone call takes place at a different time, and its a false alarm.

And then the Hispanic guy (which, I won't bother to question that logic) suddenly knowing the White Ron Stallworth seems forced. And all of a sudden, Felix pieces it together. It seems like they mishandle which how the increase the tension, and ultimately nothing happens in the spot where you expect something to happens. And that transitions into the terrorist plot in a messy way. Maybe that's the way it played out in the book. It just seems like there's quite a bit of confrontation and tension that wasn't adequately executed, that would've made the final act more impactful.

The other complaint I would have would be that certain scenes caused this movie to feel long. Now it could be because I made a last-minute decision to go watch this late Tuesday, after 10pm. All other scenes in the movie move fairly snappy, however the Black Panther speech is a full speech. The dance scene at the club almost plays the entire song. The parallel meetings between the KKK and the Black Student Union w/Harry Belafonte show feel like extended scenes. They're genuinely interesting scenes, and I think they play out nicely when viewed in a vacuum, by themselves. I feel like Spike Lee kept those scenes, in full, for informational purposes.

So, what I kept on thinking with this movie, was that this almost feels like a premise for something Martin Scorsese would direct. It has all the elements of his *""bad guy from a certain time period with an amazing story""* genre. Goodfellas, Casino, Wolf of Wall Street. It had the time period, it had some brutal realism, they showed off scenes to inform the audience of how fucked up things were back then; it had things occur that you can't believe were true. It would have funny scenes, dark comedic things happening, and it would also get serious. Clearly not edited as sharp and clever as Scorsese's best.

What I like about this movie is that, when you see the ending of a Scorsese movie about a bad guy who did bad shit and had a crazy life, you say to yourself *""wow, that was some crazy shit, I can't believe things were like that back then.""*

What this movie does is making it very clear at the end: *""this is some crazy shit that happened. Here's footage of crazy shit still happening today. The players that were at the core of this movie, here's footage of those same people attempting to do the same things to this very day. This is not a story that has come and gone. This story is still playing out right now, and its just as relevant.""*

The reason why I criticize the filmmaking is because the premise is perfect for Spike Lee creating something that aligns well with his views, but its got alot of Hollywood potential for being entertaining.

I've read that the live interest was made up for the film, but thought that some of the points they discussed with that were interesting.  The ending is a punch to the gut, of course; and thank god for the jokes that came before it.  


....An interesting personal thing: I actually watched the D. W. Griffith BIRTH OF A NATION about a year ago, and it skeeved me out; seeing a bunch of people clapping and cheering and taking it as anything but over-the-top exaggerated was BIZARRE.  ",962sh1
e9qa6jn,"i appreciated the message, i just couldn't get past how terribly it was executed.  all the acting aside from Adam Driver was amateur.  dialog was lazy.  all the racist characters were oversimplified caricatures.  but mostly the story was just too absurd; there were so many things that should have easily blown the operation:  Felix was super paranoid that Flip might be a cop, but he never searched for a wire?  never asked for an ID?  and he didn't blink when Flip was a deadshot on the shooting range, but wasn't able to hit a car even once while emptying a clip?  wasn't suspicious that a cop was tailing them the day Flip joined the organization?  and even though Felix went to Ron's house and saw the real Ron in person, they still sent Ron to be David Duke's guard?  where not only did Felix miraculously not recognize him, but the KKK let this *random black dude with a gun* guard Duke without even asking to see his badge?!  and why did they keep having Ron make all the phone calls pretending to be white, instead of just having Flip make the calls himself?  what if someone had made reference to something that was said during the calls, how would Flip have known what to say?  WAY too many things that should have easily blown his cover.

so overall it was just way too sloppy for me to stay engaged, and the writing and performances were nowhere near good enough to make up for it.  very disappointed.  3/10

e4sgr9s,"I saw this movie yesterday and the more I think  about it the less I like it. Overall I'm pretty disappointed because I think this movie could have been great with such an interesting premise and 2 good lead characters that are well acted, but the movie is just so messy.

The editing is all over the place. There are awkward cuts in some scenes where you lose continuation and you can tell it's another take that pulls you out of the movie, and then theres also scenes that either go on for too long or seem out of place (the dancing scene, or the black speech scene near the start with the bizarre Bohemian rhapsody shots of faces littered throughout) that contribute to a somewhat lengthy feeling runtime.

The script and writing also was average. Not all the jokes land. Though I like the lead, it feels like he's largely inconsequential to the overall plot and Adam Driver's character could have done most of the investigation. Theres also no real instigating incident that causes Ron to investigate the KKK, he just kind of does it all by himself without any reason. This lead to me wondering what the end goal was throughout the early parts of their investigation. It's not til like 2/3rds through that we get a plot around a bombing that's pretty underdeveloped. I feel it would have helped ground the absurdity of the basic premise to have a more linear and clear storyline. I also think Ron's conflict between the Black Union and the police is never really explored fully. 

I feel the ending really sums up the movie's problem, in that its tonally all over the place and it doesn't know what it wants to be. It shifts from drama to black comedy to almost a documentary kind of thing at the end where Spike Lee feels the need to spell everything out to you like you're dumb. Even then, the message is unclear. At times it feels like lee is saying that both sides are almost comparable (mainly at the black power, white power part near the end), but then the ending and the speech at the start from Kwame clearly is bagging on the KKK. It's just messy.

So yeah, don't see the hype with this one unfortunately and I really wanted to like it, but its just too messy in my view. The editing, the script and its messaging and other small stuff like music are a bit all over the place and turn a movie that could have been great more to an okay.

I could probably end almost all his movies with that sentence, but this one it's especially apparent. It is not a subtle film. Not that it even wants to disguise itself as subtle, because it's constantly hitting you over the head with its message unapologetically and I admire it for that. Still, I would say it came a little too close to being completely over the top. Not that our world isn't getting there as well, and in a way it's a good answer to that.

It is really funny at times, and I thought its funny moments worked better than its more poignant moments.

It also took awhile to get the ball rolling, a little too much lead up. I think a half hour of this movie could have been shaved off.

e41dutl,"I feel like I got a slightly different message than some of the comments I'm reading. To me, I felt like Spike Lee was making a statement on the state of balance we have now, with people with more radicalized views on each side, both with flawed but understandable logic. 

Through the movie it is neither the Black Power movement nor the KKK that causes change one way or the other, but rather the people in the middle, Ron and Flip, who see the actual faces in these movements for the people they are and see the flaws of the extreme people around them and work together to keep the bad actors at Bay while pushing for a greater United community.

I think it's a great commentary on today, as everyone is so radicalized and adrenaline fueled that we don't take the time to really look at what the opposing ideals are, their flaws and strengths, and have an actual dialogue where all can speak and all will listen, whereas that dialogue might actually help us progress as a people.

BTW, not equating the Black Power movement to the KKK, just noting that they draw parallels to radical groups or ideals that exist today.

I thought it was good storytelling and some great acting. Adam Driver is quickly moving up my favorite actors list. John David Washington's voice at times was a bit inconsistent, although it was fun to hear his dad, Denzel, in some of his mannerisms and speech at different times in the film.


My only problem was the long sequences that weren't necessary. The dance scene seemed to last for an eternity. I don't think I've ever seen a non-musical that filmed characters dancing throughout an entire song. I felt similar about the Kwame Ture speech too, but I get why he'd make that part long.

e4a58ka,"I only had 3 issues with the movie. Everything else about it was great.

That powerpoint ending with the flag obviously lifted from a google search was really weird. I think they should have shown clips from more than just Charlottesville, and essentially dedicating the movie to one white lady seems like a really weird movie. They also should have included some clips of police brutality. 

The weird repeats on certain things. It felt like a worldstar video where it repeats a punch or something. I half expected it to go into slow motion on the last take. 

It was a little hard to tell that Felix and the other two were killed at the end. 

This one isn't really an issue with the movie, but the actor that plays Walter looks like James McAvoy and it was weirding me out the whole movie.

My favorite detail is when Ron throws the brick through the window and Felix is shooting at him, Flip runs up and takes the gun from him after just the first shot and proceeds to empty the clip into the road immediately, protecting his partner in a way that helps his cover. This later draws suspicion from Felix when it is revealed Flip is a perfect shot and he should have been able to brain Ron.

e4mvnbv,"Did anyone else think those movie was basically not very good? The message was great and I think there's a great story in there, but the movie seemed so disjointed and poorly written to me. Looking at the reviews here, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. A few issues I have with this movie:
  
In the macro sense, everything felt *so* heavy handed. All the wink-wink moments where they're clearly talking about trump or whatever modern day issue...its like they might as well look directly into the camera and ask me if I ""get it"". And on top of that, he put that ending sequence on which (to me) felt like a high school student's school project. It just felt like he thought the audience was absolutely stupid.
  
This is a more excusable issue: why was the black guy involved in the investigation at all? Just let Adam Driver talk to them on the phone and you don't have to worry about any of the double-identity issues. I think this is pretty excusable because apparently thats just how it happened IRL but the movie could have perhaps handled it better.
  
Some of the editing was just bizarre. There were multiple times where I thought two things were going on at once, but it turns out they just weren't. The editing seemed to try to really stylize the movie at some points but then it was more conventional for the majority of the film.
  
In a more micro sense, there are some scene/plot issues I had.
  
So he calls the KKK phone number he found just printed right there in the newspaper, but when they answer they are some kind of super secret organization? But then later they aren't a secret organization because the cops are sent to protect them?
  
The scene where he is being followed by the cops on the way to the KKK bar. Felix tells him to take out the shotgun, and load it up, and then...they go to the bar??? They don't do anything with the gun. What was the point of that? I figured they would do a switcheroo where they go shoot guns in the woods or something but nope. They just load up the shotgun because...???
  
Some of the shots where it was cutting from the Black Panthers to the KKK and back again -- they are basically mirror shots of each other. And from that, I got that the message was the KKK and the Black Panthers are two sides of the same coin? Surely that wasn't the intention, because  it really goes against the rest of the message. It was really baffling given the rest of the movie. 
  
That scene where the FBI guy meets up with the main character. What? That came out of nowhere, and served no point in the rest of the movie. It felt so arbitrary.

When Ron rushes to the bomb scene at the end...he basically didn't do anything. Without him being there, those events would have unfolded in the exact same way. Why was he even there?   

Those are just a few kind of nonspecific/specific issues I had. I don't really think they're overly nitpicky, because most of them are pretty important parts of the movie. I think there's a really great story in BlackkKlansman somewhere, and a really important one as well, but Spike Lee just didn't do it justice. At its worst, it felt ham-fisted and condescending, while at its best it was just pretty interesting. 
  
5.2/10 for me. ",962sh1
e3ybs8q,"The acting was phenomenal, the sparse, kinetic camera-work worked really well during tense scenes, such as the lie-detector/shooting scene. Was really, really funny when it needed to be. My complaint, however, is it kind of ran out of steam for me during the denouement--it just kinda felt like there were too many problems that arose and meshed together at the explosion. Felt a little too jumbled and chaotic at that point. When Flip showed up to save Ron it felt like a deus ex machina that didn't really want to be a deus ex machina, but the script was a little too overloaded so there was no way out of it. 

But that doesn't really matter--the message came across quite poignantly at the end, especially with that surreal shot/call-back to early 70's blaxploitation cinema with the burning cross. Overall, I'd say a good movie that would've been great with a less bloated script.

e3xemrm,"Hilarious. And it pulled no punches, you can see where the direct alliterative nature of the scenes shine. The ""*America First*"" comments. Mentioning America being ""*great again*."" How their people are the ""***real*** *Americans*."" 

Then the movie finishing with being a period piece... and moving to today (*for the final couple minutes*). Showing that this mentality isn't just of a bygone era. The mentality of its characters isn't ancient and in the past. It's of today. Still. Proudly ignorant chuckleheads still think like that. 

As a film, though, not a statement, it was a very well made one. Pacing was quick, I never felt bored. Just a little jumpy with the editing at times but nothing disorienting. Solid cinematography, though safe and unoriginal. Acting by everyone was top notch. I never thought the racists were cartoonishly portrayed (*save for that one fat retarded one*), that's mild to how bad some are. Driver did great. And JDW I hope to see more of, that dude was so perfect. 

Only character I didn't like was Patrice at the end. Harrier did good acting, just didn't like her character. She helped bust the bad cop, she saw not all cops are ""*pigs*"". She saw the actual good working from the **inside** can do. And yet she's still stuck in her old mentality. She just can't change because... why? 

Story wise it doesn't have any bizarre twists and turns, it's very straight forward. Well written, competent. Funny scenes be funny and when it needs to get serious it doesn't do so by grinding to a sloggish halt. It chugs along briskly. 

Then it gets to the end. The music has an upswing. There's a final sting on the bad cop and they arrest him. Everyone is smiling and drinking and it's a cathartic ending. But then it's not... there's a cross burning. The tone shifts instantly. They don't get the Hollywood happy ending. Because even with all the good they've done these people are still here, still organizing.

Overall I laughed aplenty and enjoyed this movie. Would highly recommend for those that don't wear *those* red truck hats. 8/10. ",962sh1

That scene at the end where they’re all in the chief’s office and he says to basically get rid of the paperwork because Ron says they did too good of a job, and then coupling it with the country in distress makes this movie one that should be required viewing for everyone to see how these issues aren’t just in the past, but relevant even more so now.

e43nyur,"This one blew me away, did not think it would be as good as it was.  
 
I was initially worried Spike Lee would be too ham-fisted or too on-the-nose, but nearly everything was very well done.  
 
I had no idea Ron was played by Denzel's son, but his performance here will definitely be a breakout role for him going forward.   
I also had no idea Steve Buscemi had a brother! I didn't realize until I looked up the cast after seeing this that that wasn't Steve Buscemi in the movie.  
 
Adam Driver was the highlight for me though, he is proving to be more and more versatile with every role he takes. His monologue about being Jewish but not really aware of his ethnicity or how he never considered himself ""separate"" was surprisingly affecting for me, since the background he was describing kind of mirrors my own.  
 
The final montage of footage from Charlottsville was also perfectly executed. The juxtaposition of Trump's speech of ""good guys on both sides"" and the shots of Nazis at the rally along with footage of the car plowing through the crowds was incredibly effective -- you could hear a pin drop by the time the upside down flag showed up.

There was no attachment or chemistry between the main 'pairing', and there was zero exploration about how Adam Driver's character was exploring his Jewish faith by being in such a hate-filled group of people. Washington's character looked to be given some interesting development, but there was such a shallow exploration of how the black power movement was affecting him beyond his relationship with Harrier's character that the 3rd Act's scene where he stands outside the police precinct felt out of place. The climatic scene where the car blows up was such an unsatisfying scene, and there was no emphasis on the obvious exalting point that Lee had in his head of Driver's character showing his true colours as a Jewish man of faith who isn't a racist. I'm not sure why there was only one piece of climatic music during the entire film, but it felt like a parody in some cases. That's disregarding the ham-fisted lines of dialogue that Lee put's in the film, almost as if he is scared that the audience will forget that they should draw a parallel between the film and reality as we know it., such as the entire arresting scene in the bar, where suddenly the racist police chief isn't so racist, and the High-School-Musical-esque ending becomes a reality, for a short while, then the chief goes back to being racist.

The worst blunder, however, is the complete lack of genuine danger that the KKK members embraces. When Ron meets the Klan members, they seem dangerous, pathologically racist and a torchlight for the average white American at that time. However, it soon becomes apparent that each of them is a caricature of a Disney villain: the fat drunk, the crazy dude with a gun and the sophisticated leader. I think the parallel between the ending footage of the Charlottesville rally would have been much stronger if Lee accentuated the fact that these people can't be ignored, and should be stood up to and fought till the bitter end.  Instead, the audience feels like the good guys have such a power hold over them.

Perhaps I missed the entire point of the film. Maybe it was a parody, or a comedy (because it was incredibly funny at times, like the scene with Felix and his wife in bed), but I kept hoping that a strong mainline point about fighting a constant systematic oppression that the black community of America has been facing would have come through. Even if Spike Lee felt that a 'smack you in the face and shout at you to do something' approach was what he was aiming for, he didn't manage to quite figure out through what plot medium, and instead it felt like I was missing some bigger picture to tie the knot on it all.",962sh1
e3xe4ku,"Tightly knit plot that was emotionally pulling, suprisingly funny and engaging all along. I nearly cried when they showed the footage of Charlottesville, the car murders in partictular. The movie was angering in all the right ways and really made you *feel*. Very powerful stuff. The acting was top notch and the cinematography was amazing. After the dead silence caused by the upside down american flag, My theater was clapping uproariously, so i dont think i'm the only one that feels this way.

One of my favourite films of all time.

10/10",962sh1
e44ymm6,"Great film. Overall, it really put into perspective how fucked up things have been, and continue to be, when it comes to racism in America. I teared up a couple times watching it. 

One of those times was during the climax when Ron wrestles Felix's wife to the ground while the explosion went off in the background. Just seeing the lengths they went to to cause harm to Patrice was distressing, and then Ron getting arrested pushed it even further. It reminded me of the end of Get Out, when the police's arrival inspired dread rather than relief, which is so depressing and telling.

And then of course, the ending with the Charlottesville montage was so sobering. My theater was silent when the credits rolled, and everyone just stayed in their seats for a quiet moment.

The film wasn't quite as comedic as the trailer's vibe, though it did have moments of levity. John Washington and Adam Driver were both terrific. Driver in particular was really great (I've become a huge fan of his). He kind of stole the middle segment of the movie for me, when he's all introspective after having to interact with the KKK. He conveys so much through little tics and facial expressions - i.e. his flabbergasted look at Felix's declaration that the Holocaust isn't real, and his quick attempt to play it off.",962sh1
e4a0eq5,"Saw it tonight, I really liked it, 7/10. I would've *loved* it had there not been scenes that seemed to drag, and a few minor plot things that bugged me (why the hell was Flip exposed by an ex con and not his star of David necklace?!) 


It was an absolute sledgehammer to the head for folks who might be (wilfully or not) ignorant to our current racial climate/government/President. I loved it for that.


I also loved the vulnerability Flip showed while talking about how he didn't ever think about being Jewish while growing up --until he was undercover as a Klan recruit. It was moving, and I thought held a mirror to how many people are willing to overlook their own backgrounds in favor of being *against others* (read: immigrants). How quickly we forget our own heritage or past.


If the 2 hour sledgehammer wasn't enough, Spike threw in some current day footage which was absolutely brutal to watch. Heartbreaking. Raw. Infuriating. I watched it all as it happened IRL, but seeing it on the big screen broke me. Our country is sick and something needs to change. It feels so hopeless. This movie only highlighted that fact.


I loved the overall message and think it's so important and timely. It was a good movie. I'd see it again and I urge people to see it themselves.

Initially didn't like the Charlottesville footage because, imo, movies shouldn't do that much handholding, but I can see why people found it powerful; it's all too easy to write the KKK off as villains of a past time, and consequently not make the connection to the present.

e4bpcdq,"BlacKkKlansman is powerfully relevant and poignant in this socio-political climate (which Spike Lee unsubtly reminds us of with footage from Charlottesville) and it’s undoubtedly very well acted, competently shot, and smartly written. But it has some issues that prevent it from transcending the subject matter and being a great movie in its own right. It has some pacing issues and it definitely feels too long, though its main problem is tone. Based on its marketing and some Tarantino-esque pulpy stuff, it would seem that the movie is emulating 70s blacksploitation cop flicks. It’s definitely doing that, but there’s also a different kind of humor in it along with political commentary (referencing Trump), a downplayed romance, tension, character moments, musical moments, or suggestive shots of people listening to a speech. Many times the film is lecturing the viewer or making a statement instead of telling a story. It’s a great movie about racism, but tonally it’s too uneven and preachy to be a great movie, period.",962sh1

One thing that confused me: he joins the police and while there is the one racist officer, it's established that the Chief and Sergeant are not. They assign him to surveil the civil rights rally because the speaker and attendees are dangerous, in fact the biggest danger in America. So like the next day Ron just calls up the Klan and starts an infiltration, and when he informs the Chief and Sarge they just say OK let's do it? Not ""why would we care about the Klan?""",962sh1

e4uhinq,"I love Spike Lee. I think the 25th hour is one of the better movies of the 2000s and Do the Right Thing made me want to be a filmmaker.

I was completely underwhelmed by BlackKklansman.

One way to think about a movie - are there any truly memorable images/shots/sequences from the flick?

For example:

Thelma and Louise - Convertable flying off a cliff

Alien - Chest burster

Rocky - Climbing the steps, or ""Yo Adrian!""

I saw this movie 2 hours ago and I can't remember a single image from it. There are no memorable lines, scenes, or images.

It was very well acted and well shot but there was just...no there there. I think it was the muddled screenplay that just did not translate to the screen. It was such a great story, but somewhere between the book and the movie it just lost its way.

I'm bummed out because a Spike Lee joint is usually something to look forward to, although everyone once in a while he makes a *really* bad flick.

This was neither. It wasn't good, it wasn't bad, it was just meh - and apathy is worse than hating something (moviewise).

I really wanted to love this movie, but it didn't...do anything for me.

There are several monologues within the film that infuse a sobering sense of reality and history. Some might find these scenes preachy and political, but I personally enjoy this choice of communication through the movie medium. It grounded the message and never let you imagine this story to be just that. I thought Lee handled these scenes (which by design can take a viewer out of the movie) with a deft hand, keeping an appropriate beat and style to them.",962sh1

All of the dead/dying civil war soldiers are on the ground and you see Scarlet running through asking the doctor for help for the pregnancy. I know that this can have multiple meanings but I took it as people being single minded and blind to the bigger problems happening.

The movie had such a great blend of comedy and drama, as well as the real world implications.

One thing that I debated with my friends walking out: was the police chief part of the Klan?

At the end the police chief also says they are having budget cuts due to “inflation”. Is that a coincidence or is it a wink towards the audience that the chief is a member?",962sh1

e3xjzyk,"This movie was sloppy and inconsistent at best, and here y'all are jerking it off just because you can tell it wants to say something profound - despite the fact that it falls flat at every conceivable turn. 

""Racism is bad"". Whoa Spike Lee slow down, if you're not careful you might just die from wokeness. This movie and your sycophantic reactions to it are the cinema equivalent of a spoken word poetry jam where some overconfident hippie gets up on stage and spouts off some hollow banal bullshit about how ""The man is the man because the man ain't got no plan"" which doesn't actually mean anything, but the whole room listening knows that it's supposed to be deep and insightful, so you all start snapping your fingers and nodding along, deathly afraid to admit to the person sitting next to you --or to admit to yourself-- that you don't really know what the fuck is going on. 

The speeches drag on top long with effectively no discernible point (not to mention the dance scene), the message and theming are muddy at worst and simple at best, the main character is largely undefined and plays ultimately little role in the events happening around him (why did they even need him talking on the phone after Adam Driver was involved? plus he did nothing in the climactic scene, the clansmen blow themselves up with no police intervention), the editing feels inconsistent and unsure of itself, the jokes fall mostly flat in large part because it doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy or a drama and subsequently does neither well, and the ending feels tacked on in the name of cheap emotional appeal (which is what the film itself should have done but doesn't).

This is low-brow Oscar bait for the  crowd who desperately want to be feel smart and ""woke"" but don't have the critical thinking skills for it.

I think the only fault here would be character introduction and development. I wish there was more emphasis on how this investigation changed Ron and Flip, instead it kept on the action. There were also strange editing blips and cuts with scenes that I couldnt tell if they were intentional or not, so that also added to it. 

As for the Charlottesville footage, I think that’s what set reality in for me. It was striking and created a message of truth behind the story. Do I think the Trump digs could have been avoided?

Italians and Sicilians are not WASPS but “ethnic” white, or “Mediterranean White” as I call them. They aren’t the same as WASPS.

e3zsxwd,"It is interesting that BlacKkKlansman, Blindspotting, and Sorry to Bother You are currently in the theaters at the same time. All three films deal with the same subject and thematic matter - i.e.,racial inequality. To a lesser extent, The First Purge also deals with the same subject and theme, and it is also still in theaters.  So, we currently have four films in theaters; all four have black leads with multiracial supporting casts, and they deal with racial inequality in America. 

I have seen all four films; (much thanks to AMC Stubs A-List; they are films that I would not have seen with money out of my own pocket.) IMO, BlacKkKlasman and Blindspotting are good and about on par in terms of quality. Both are good but not great.  Personally I liked Blindspotting a little better than BlacKkKlansman. The quality/style of BlacKkKlansman is consistent throughout. I really liked the first and second acts of Blindspotting, but was put off by the monologue rapping at the end.  I wished the final confrontation in Blindspotting was a straight drama like the rest of the film; instead, the resolution was an artistic/poetic interpretation with an angry rap, which seemed out-of-place and did not fit in with the overall realistic style and tone of the film.

Sorry to Bother You dealt with the same issue on race - *and more.* Class inequality and corporate greed were actually the primary messages and race is secondary. I liked the film... until it introduced the ridiculous ""horse""-shit. Urgh... WTF? Why?!? It seemed that the writer was unable to resolve the story, so they just shoved in the horseshit at the end.  IMO, Sorry to Bother You ended up being the worst of the four films due to its poor resolution. 

The First Purge was boring in the beginning - i.e., the initial setup  dragged on for too long. However, it became entertaining when the Purge commenced, bloodshed began, and the  conspiracy revealed; (which was not a surprise even for me who have not seen any of the previous Purge movies, but the actions really got going in the third act.)",962sh1

The scene where Ron goes to the are where the KKK were shooting earlier had such out of place music. Also that same guitar theme which I think is the main movies theme song or whatever, played constantly over so many seems. The music should accurately fit the tone of the scene and if you play the same exact song, its obviously not gonna match the tone of many of the scenes because most scenes vary in tone. Another weird technical choice was when flip and the KKK member was in the truck talking when the audio for the grand wizard starts, which then continues through ought the next scene, and then finally to the scene where the audio fits. Audio for the next scene starting at the end of the previous scene is fine, but 2 whole scenes earlier is such a weird and bad choice imo. If I had to guess, I'd say this movie was subject to some reshoots that mess things up that I'll get into.

The hamfisted trump allusions were annoying and really took me out of the experience. I don't want my 1970's character referencing the current 2019 president just because the director of this film doesn't like said president. The character can allude to problems that may still be prevalent today but in the scene were Ron is talking to the Sargent saying ""surely America wouldn't elect someone like THAT to be president,"" he might as well have winked at the camera. This scene doesn't really connect to anything else in the story besides the overall theme which makes me think this might have been added to create more anti trump rhetoric in the movie.

I liked the first scene with Ron where the 2 cops are saying ""are you gonna be able to handle another police officer calling you niggers"" and ""you're gonna have to hold all that weight on your shoulders"" or whatever was really good. It seemed to set up for some interesting conflict, like jacoby in that movie Bright, except maybe not shit this time. And Ron is very adamant about him being able to compose himself in this situations. So with that big set up there is a total of ONE officer in the force that gives him shit, everyone else is either perfectly respectable or just loves Ron. So despite Ron being so adamant about being able to face all discrimination, he still loses his shit when one officer gives him any disrespect. Makes the character seem pretty immature to me. Its fine if they set him up as a character that doesn't take racist shit but instead they show him as either a liar, or an overly cocky or full of himself type of person.

Rons character isn't terrible but he was poorly written in some aspects and didn't really have any arc. Speaking of arcs, one of the few things I really liked about this was flips character arc. It felt very earned and natural and I liked his performance most of all in the whole movie.

Flips character seemed to constantly be in situations where tension was starting to build up and seemed to lead to what would be intense moments that I thought would test how far flip would go in certain scenarios to prove himself to the KKK. For example, him being given a shotgun in the first truck ride when they find out a black guy, which is Ron, is following them. He loads it up and everything aaaaand we never see it or have it mentioned again. So why bother? There was felix constantly suspecting flip. There is the scene where flip takes the gun away felix to shoot at and purposefully miss Ron who is driving away. In a scene soon after this, the KKK gang doing target practice where flip shows he is actually an amazing shot and then shows suspicion on felix's face. Will flips cockyness get him into trouble or escalate the situation? No, it gets mentioned when someone says ""maybe you'll hit him next time"" and never brought up again. A later scene has felix look up and check out rons address and they confront flip about it but it goes no where. None of this ever builds up because the only reason felix and ron are exposed was when another random character notices flip and informs felix which who would have guessed, also leads no where.

Before I get into the end of the movie, why on earth did the main police guy order ron to be the body guard of the grand wizard knowing the situation which he is even explained to. I know he says ""cant you disguise your voice"" but why on earth would he take that risk? Was lazy writing to get flip and ron together with the KKK for tension.

So the events near the end are pretty lack luster as well. The wife of felix was supposed to drop a purse next to the one house but their were cops so plan B is put it at the student body presidents house. Does she try put the purse next to the door just like with plan A? No, she tries to shove it in the mailbox for no reason, then under the car, probably so Ron could confront her, lazy writing. 

The tone is all over the place in the final few scenes. Ron walks in the office, everyone is laughing having a good time until the chief calls everyone in to cancel the program and everyone's pissed. Like, no shit, you guys were exposed, how are you going to keep going under cover. The chief mentions they dont want the public to know but he could have just said ""we gotta shut it down you guys were exposed."" Then we get to the final scene where Rons girlfriend is like ""but youre still a pig."" Her character hates cops because they're racist so she hates ron, but hes black and clearly not racist which her character never seems to learn. Would have made good character progression if she learns that not all cops are bad and I don't know why Spike didn't decide to include that. Then we get to one of the only other parts of the movie I really like which is the final shot of them moving down the hallway which was shot in a very pleasing and interesting way to see the cross burning and the closeup of one of the kkk members hooded face. A decent ending to an otherwise unlikable 3rd act. 

And theeeen the present day footage, showing Neo nazi rallies and whatnot. Let me tell you why this was one of, if not the stupidest decision of the entire movie. Everyone knows the KKK is bad and we dont need a movie to ridicule them, they do that enough on their own. But even if you believe that this should be done, its counter productive. The KKK presence had greatly reduced in the 21st century UNTIL they started getting attention again and they are now re surging. The only thing this does encourage more KKK and neo nazi activity. Lindsey Ellis has a great video on this subject that I'd recommend anyone watch.

I'd say this is an otherwise lackluster movie that doesn't shine in too many places and is plagued with anti KKK themes we never needed in the first place.

Edit: I'd also like to add I thought the acting was mostly decent. I really liked flips performance.
If I ahd to rate the movie I'd give it a 4/10. 3/10 including the present day footage ending that was tacked on.",962sh1
e3xkydi,"I did not like this film. I thought the acting, editing and direction was just poor overall. The characters were over the top and unbelievable and the conversations just weren't how people talk. It all turned sour for me when they kept awkwardly showing spotlit faces during the first black power rally.  I just felt no flow in dialog or chemistry between actors. The relationship between JD Washington and the female lead made no sense and was cringy. And screening of ""Birth of a Nation"" with everyone hollering at the screen, who would watch a movie like that, with people yelling at the screen? It all just became so unbelievable I just didn't care anymore.",962sh1
e3xnjqi,"Really, really damn good. More laughs than I expected and more emotionally effective than I expected. Alec Baldwin fucking up lines at the beginning was hilarious, the cops coffee spit take was great and the “is your dick circumstanced?” probably got the biggest laugh from me. Still though, towards the beginning some of the dialogue felt a bit too on the nose but the ending kinda ties it together effectively, like it’s not always subtle but under the circumstances it doesn’t need to be. Definitely made me want to take a shower after spending the better part of an hour just watching white trash hurl every slur under the sun, but it’s one of the better movies of the year so far and succeeds in all the ways Sorry to another You didn’t. 8 or a 9 for me.",962sh1

e5myj31,"It felt like the movie thought I was incredibly stupid. It pointed out 7 times that ""HEY TRUMP SAYS RACIST SHIT LIKE THE KKK!!!!!"" that I was positively offended when Spike Lee just said ""fuck it, these idiots still dont get the message, roll the YouTube video of Charlottesville and Trump"". 

Laughed a few times at the stupidity of the KKK guys, groaned the other 200 times. For the most part I didn't laugh and I was confused whether this was supposed to be funny or serious, and then I just got annoyed at it. 

This movie just wants to slam its message in your face and does so in the most unsubtle way I've ever seen in cinema. I can't understand the rave reviews it's getting. The message is obvious. Racism is bad and Trump kind of enables racists. That's not worth a 95% rottentomatoes score, so let's look at the movie. Nope it's just bad, simplistic and treats you like you're dumb. It's played extremely flat. Especially the scene after the KKk guys go shooting together. When our protagonist for no reason is picking up a shotgun shell and looking at the targets. Oh my God, the KKK was shooting at targets that resemble little black men!!!! Who would have thought it. Scene ends. That's it. What does that scene add? That's how dumb, Spike Lee thinks you are. And maybe he's right? It's getting super good reviews. Or maybe critics are afraid of slamming an anti-racist film for fears of being called racist.

Edit: maybe I should say that I'm from Holland so I have a little bit less connection with the horrors of trump being president, but even I thought the constant references to his presidency were so obnoxious. ""Make America great again"" repeated 8 times. I get it. ",962sh1
e47rogi,"Trump supporter here.  Probably one of the few in this thread. 

I thought it was good but not great.  I loved the acting from John David Washington, Adam Driver, and Topher Grace.  Driver's subplot about struggling with his Jewish identity was quite interesting, and I wish it was explored more.  

I found the real life story interesting, but thought the pacing and tone of the film was all over the place.  There were some very well executed comedic moments, and some very well executed dramatic moments, but a lot of the time it felt like the film was being stretched between those two sides while not fully pulling off either.  Same kind of thought for the music - I enjoyed a lot of it but it often felt out of place.   

The ending of the film (the main ending, not the final scene) was very odd.  Strange editing and jarring mood whiplash. 

The digs at Trump were hamfisted and overly overt to the point of being annoying.  I thought the ending of the film (the final scene) was horrendous - emotionally manipulative, exploitative, and heavy-handed.  

Overall, I'd give it at 7/10.",962sh1
e40ks1g,"I think this is a great movie and really enjoyed it, and want to share my two cents on the ending. Personally, I think it was unnecessary detracts from the movie as a whole, although I suspect it effectively achieved Spike Lee's ultimate goal. 


There were countless unmissable allusions to the contemporary significance of the issues highlighted in the movie, that frankly you'd have to be an idiot to miss. I thought they were plenty effective, extremely direct, and negate the need for the ending coda.


Prior to the ending coda, the movie is a neatly wrapped up story that embodies what I love about films compared to TV or other story driven visual media; it makes it's points (including the modern context of racist issues) in an artful way that only cinema can achieve. The ending coda detracts from that achievement. Using real footage may help further convey the movie's messages, but it doesn't do so artfully, and ultimately detracts from what was achieved in the main movie.


That being said, the ending coda did have a powerful effect on the viewer, which I think was Spike Lee's ultimate goal. Absent the coda, I can see how he may have felt the movie left the viewer with too much of a ""feel good"" moment. I can understand that, and can see it as a small weakness in the main movie, clearly one that Spike Lee thought was present. 


I've learned from this thread that the ending was literally tacked on in post production. It shows. Personally, I think he achieved his goal effectively enough, but if If Spike Lee really wanted to end his movie with a more moving affect on his audience, I think he could have done so within the context of the main film. That would make it a more impressive piece of cinema, versus a slightly tarnished movie that ultimately serves more as a means to deliver a message.

e3xevsw,"It was definitely entertaining, but to me just didn’t pack a punch and it didn’t show me any new perspective. The film felt very politically ambivalent, the only real stances I saw were that the Klan is bad and that Trump is bad, both of these points, especially the former, and popular beliefs that I myself believe. I wanted the film to show me a new perspective, open my eyes to something in a brand new way, let me see the world how Spike Lee does, sorta like how Blindspotting totally changed the way I thought while watching the movie. This felt less personal for the sake of mass appeal.

This man, of course, missed the point. I think this movie should be mandatory viewing, but it isn’t going to change minds. If you’re stuck in your ways, you’re not going to get anything out of this movie. This man wasn’t looking to listen, and if you don’t listen, you’re going to come out of this movie not changed.

e4alf2w,"IMO hype's getting a bit carried away with this one. The movie's good, the acting's great, the message is doubly great and powerful (especially that gutpunching bit at the end to tie it to the present day) but is a bit more forced and heavyhanded than it had to be to get its point across and was a bit too on-the-nose at times. There were some issues, like how much we spend with Adam Driver's character (it almost felt like he was on screen more than John David Washington if you take out the random romantic sideplot) despite getting basically zero backstory on him.

Also, despite how heavyhanded the message was for most of the movie, I wasn't really sure where it stood on Patrice's character and her crusade against the cops, a plotline that felt completely unresolved. Her happy scene with Ron and all of the cops in the bar cheering and celebrating after they got rid of the racist cop felt extremely out of place for her, *especially* considering immediately after that scene she slaps Ron with an ultimatum that he either quits the police force or they can't be together...it made me really despise her character tbh.

Fantastic main message but just a good 7/10 movie for me - it feels a bit like some of the 10/10's here are trying to say ""racism is bad, look I'm not racist because I loved this movie!"" Instead of ""I'm not racist, I have a friend who's black!"" it's ""I'm not racist, I think BlacKkKlansman is the best movie of all time!""",962sh1

e3yhlfr,"Damn, I was thinking this was a 6.5, but the last act and the last 5 minutes knock it up to an 8 for me. It's going to piss off a lot of boys on the internet, but it's a very important film for right now. 

A couple small things annoyed me though...why didn't they just have Flip do the phone calls? The Dallas/El Paso mix-up could have been a lot worse. And really, Felix in all of his paranoia never once patted down Fake Ron?

But that's just nitpicking. Like I said, it's an important film for right now. 

Edit: one more thing - the most powerful moment for me was the closeups on black faces during Kwame's speech. It hit me that I wasn't looking at actors, but real black people in America who felt exactly what he was saying. ",962sh1
e3yrob8,"I was very disappointed by quite a few things. For example, the speech at the beginning about how black people can be great without a white mans help, and then the entirety of the film is the exact opposite - and it did NOT seem to be done in an ironic way.

The conflict Adam Driver was facing would be hands down more compelling. There’s no question - he was constantly having to deny his Jewish heritage to prove himself while always being watched by the Psycho member. Rather than give this conflict the attention it deserved, they had it downplayed midway through the movie with his “Didn’t really grow up Jewish” speech to the MC. That felt cheap and wrong in the context of this movie as well as basic storytelling, especially since him admitting that he was now being forced to think about this constantly was never further explored.

Outside of his lover, the MC was rarely in danger and rarely had real stakes to deal with, which made the story on its own lag at times.

There’s a few other problematic things, like almost all of the white racists being incompetent (if this was all they were they wouldn’t be scary IRL). Or how the black female love interest was of course light skinned, while the strong minded dark skinned black woman was relegated of course relegated to comic relief. If there was a movie to shake SOMETHING up, it really could have been this one.

What was the lesson at the end?

What was the theme overall?

There were times when this was a movie and times where it was a lecture. 

The idea is to impact the audience right? In my mind, that means crafting a compelling narrative that can change the audience’s life. Moreover, it means making a movie for the people who need to see this. 

There was a lot of potential for greatness and some great moments, but I don’t think this movie satisfied those. 


And it case it matters, im Black.",962sh1
e401mhm,I liked the movie but why did they ended like that,962sh1
e41if2d,"It was okay.

I mean, I found there to be some interesting parts in it, but I was kind of *bored.* It didn't really pick up until the end, which was honestly the only part I found tense. Even if Kylo Ren is in the midst of a bunch of racists with guns (who also hate Jews, which he is), I didn't feel the tension around. Maybe it was because I didn't care much for the characters, some who were fleshed out and others who were there to serve a basic need, or maybe it was because there wasn't anybody presented to be scared *of*.

Yeah, I know, they're the KKK, but even the Nazis could be made boring in the wrong hands. He went with them, and they were there to question him a bit, but you never really feel a dangerous presence, especially since every scene with the members has that one fat bumbling idiot in it who's always drunk or something, and it's kind of hard to be worried for your character when that guy's around.

Speaking of characters, the romantic subplot felt *really* forced, with the woman (whose name I don't even recall) being shoved into a scene every now and then so she can give a perspective from the Black Power side. She was one of those cardboard cutouts mentioned, and when the protagonist has to save her (but really doesn't) it's pretty lame since you don't really care if she lives or dies.

Let's redirect to the pacing of the story. There were some enjoyable scenes I wanted more of (like the conversations with David Duke and the protagonist, whose name is Ron, by the way), and some scenes that I wish weren't as present as they were (a good amount of the scenes in the police station, where Kylo Ren, Guy-Who's-In-Movies-With-Adam-Sandler, and Little Denzel are talking, as an example). Here's why I wish they weren't.

The comedy isn't very effective. I chuckled maybe once or twice, a smile here or there, but overall it kind of fell flat. It almost feels like the comedy is restrained, with some scenes packed with jokes, and some taking on a serious tone, like the writers couldn't immediately tell what they were going for. Even worse was when they tried to do both in one scene (refer back to that bumbling, fat guy), and what you get it something very uncertain, like there's contending ideas going around.

*Or,* it could have been that my expectations were different. I expected a very comedic movie, as I feel that's what the advertising was going for. But it's more of a drama, a drama that's too lighthearted to be intense, but not funny enough to be comedic.

It was a decent movie.

e41xi41,"What a film! It’s very provocative film and executed in perfect spike lee fashion. Reminds me of his film, Do The Right Thing, with its unapologetic attitude.  My favorite scenes are the following. The college event.  Program gets cut.(lack of resolution.) the build up to the final burning cross scene. 


The college event: such a  beautiful sequence. The speaker was mostly shown from a lower perspective giving him a sense of dominance over the audience. While the audience served as a contrast by being filmed from a high above pointing down at them.  These alternating sequences allow the viewer to see a type of manipulation than can occur by someone very cunning and is the voice of a movement. The audience show cases the beautiful African features but they seem caught in a trance willing to join the cause at all costs. I see it as such an ode to the film Triumph Of The Will. Nazi propaganda but helped making the camera a vehicle to express subjectivity in a frame.

I was a bit disappointed with resolution or lack of actually. I was mad that they couldn’t resolve the problem. They get defunded and I’m mad cuz this could have been an opportunity to bring it down. But as we know it, the organization continues to exist. But because this scene made me mad, it mad me appreciate that wonderful dolly scene.

Dolly scene:   You think that it’s over between the couple . Then suddenly they have two team up one last time in black exploitation fashion.

e3z9j6j,"There was a lot I liked about this film and a lot I didn't. The first act as a whole was excellent. I liked the way they showed Ron's rise in the department. But once we started to get into the Klan, the movie started to drag. There was pretty much no consistency among the small group of Klansters. They are all written as a bunch of village idiots, and as true as this may be, I never got the sense that they were truly evil. The same can be said of David Duke. 

Spike Lee seems to be going for a comedic tone, but if that was the case I think he could've gone way overboard with the jokes. If he wanted this to be a thriller, he could've made the Klan more evil. But I never felt like Adam Driver's character was really in any danger. The Klan members all seemed stupid and recycled from other movies about racists, and at a certain point the police work just stopped being interesting. And this is what I was most excited to see.

On the upside, the performances were pretty great all around. The only one I didn't like was the Panther girlfriend. Her only purpose seemed to be to present an extra moral dilemma for Ron. We see that Ron is trying to be a different kind of black man than what his brethren would want him to be, and clearly the girlfriend doesn't approve of this. I'm not sure if Lee was purposefully drawing comparisons between her idealistic brand of identity politics and that of the Klan. There's a scene where the Klan chants ""White power!"" and the Panthers chant ""Black power!"", and a few other scenes when I literally had no fucking idea what was being communicated. Lee's films can be confusing in their messages and that's what I like about them. But this time I didn't feel the stakes were high for the characters, like in Do the Right Thing. 

Of course, Spike's brash use of other movies as to make his statements is always refreshing, and the bookends of this movie are both fantastic. I don't mind a movie being overtly political as long as its entertaining, and this movie sometimes manages to be both. The main problems I had were with the story. Too many scenes dragged and made the movie seem much longer than it needed to be. Overall, there was more I liked about this movie than I didn't, but it was also a bit disappointing.

e41ofpt,"I really liked this.  It's much less of a comedy than I expected going in, but it's funny at parts and nerve-wracking at others. It kind of kicks subtlety to the curb, but then again white supremacy isn't a topic which really deserves nuance.  

What I liked: Like I said above, it has a good grasp of tone. It's funny when it wants to be funny, it's tense when it wants to be tense, and it's really affecting when it wants to be. I thought in particular the scene where the klan is inducting the new members while the speaker is talking to the black student union was particularly well done. Visually I really liked the scene leading up to the cross-burning. Other standout scenes for me would be the opening with Alec Baldwin and the bombing scene.

What I didn't like: I thought a couple of the performances fell flat,  John David Washington in particular.  I think it may have been a character choice rather than acting, but it wasn't a choice I particularly liked. I also thought the character of Felix was a little comically evil and it didn't really work for me. I also thought the ending didn't flow together very well (I mean the end of the narrative, not the Charlottesville stuff). The scene where they caught the racist cop was fun, but it didn't make sense within the context of the surrounding scenes.

By a random set of circumstances, the last three movies I've seen in theaters are this, *Blindspotting*, and *Sorry to Bother You*, and this was probably my least favorite of the three, but that's less a criticism of this movie than a testament to the others. I'd give it 4/5.",962sh1

The films doesn't end, it just stops.

So there is no resolution to Ron and Patrices relationship, they're in the middle of discussing it and are at an impasse when they go down the hall and the film stops. And the debate over whether Ron can make a difference within the police is forgotten about.

Nothing really happens to Flip after the skin in the game discussion, there's no sense of him understanding class solidarity or anything.

Personally I would have liked to have seen more of the Klan members and their lives and what motivates their beliefs and hate. How they're distracted from their own problems with racism and given an easy target to blame, their fears are manipulated and exploited, whatever it might be.",962sh1

Wow how insightful, Trump is totally like the KKK grand dragon. They had a conversation about ""Oh America would NEVER elect someone like Duke to be president"" and practically winked at the camera. Couple that with the ridiculous ending, a lazy clip show with cheap editing, and it really took the power out of the film.

The actual movie itself was good enough on it's own to make a statement, we didn't need Spike talking directly to the audience screaming ""THIS IS THE POINT OF THE MOVIE!""

6/10 for me, 8/10 if somebody competent directed it and left some subtlety to the imagination. ",962sh1

I went into this movie with high hopes. Especially after seeing Jordan Peele was involved with it. I loved Get Out. This movie started off strong, but around 30 minutes into it, the music and cheesy-ness took me out of it. I was having a difficult time taking it seriously.

I was half tempted to shout Trump when they asked the ""Do you REALLY think someone associated with the Klan would ever be elected president?""  The cops arresting Ron, the chief being a dick.  I get it. 
Spike is trying to motivate (and kinda bait) people to vote.  The guy telling the story at the rally and the ending were the only parts that elicited emotion from me.  

The acting was fine.  They didn't kill it like Lakeith and TT and everyone else in STBY.  I didn't feel any chemistry with Ron and Patrice.  All of their scenes were a bore.  Driver was great but I wanted more.  The scene after the lie detector was thrilling. I wish that was a turning point for his character to grab the reins a little bit but I didn't see much more of that.

e48oyxx,"SPOILERS

I'm kind of torn on this film. I'll address the obvious first; that ending. Simple, powerful, moving footage, yes. The transition from movie to real-world footage is frightening, but what's the point? To show us that white supremacists are shitty, hate-mongering idiots? Well, yeah, no shit. To tell us that if we don't stand the fuck up, history is doomed to repeat itself? To show us that our president is no better than a KKK member? Now that's a much more interesting idea, but goddamn, Spike Lee just beat us over the head with these parallels from the getgo of the film. I mean, even Trump’s campaign slogans are used in the white supremacist rhetoric (America first, take America back, etc.). The ending makes the message more real, more full of rage, more in-your-face.

But I just don't know what to make of it. I want to love it; I want to be stunned in silence like the rest of my theater. I was shocked when the credits rolled, but more just by the disturbing nature of the footage. But to me, the ending came across as almost pandering and exploitative to the audience. 

For a movie about the KKK and how its philosophies are just as prevalent today as ever, BlacKkKlansman is an exceptionally safe movie. There is a line at the beginning of the film, about how we have to acknowledge that racists can be just as smart/organized in order to understand how racism is still so prevalent. I really loved that line. Yet every white supremacist character in the film is a fucking moron! They're all bigoted buffoons who say ridiculous shit that everyone in the audience is obviously going to laugh off. BlacKkKlansman plays to what the audience already thinks, and doesn't really say anything new. I hate to say it's preaching to the choir, but it really is.

I feel a lot like Ron Stallworth after listening to Kwame Ture at the beginning of the film. He agrees with Kwame's stance, but he certainly doesn't stand for the rhetoric Kwame uses. I feel what Spike Lee is going for, and I agree that the same hate that fueled the KKK is having a significant and dangerous influence on today's society. But do I agree with the way he went about saying it? Fuck no.

On the other hand, maybe that's just what people need to see to wake up. While I might feel that the social commentary (even in the ""movie-portion"") was too on-the-nose, maybe it will help some people see the hypocrisy of their ways.

It feels kinda unnecessary to talk about much else in BlacKkKlansman, but there are a few things I want to highlight beyond the obvious social issues the film tries to tackle. John David Washington is fan-damn-tastic and hilarious as Ron Stallworth. The film itself has excellent situational humor, and some very funny lines. Tension holds surprisingly well during the entire David Duke/bomb scene, and the final phone call between Ron and David Duke is fucking hilarious. A couple things I didn't like: Adam Driver's character doesn't really have much development or depth over the course of the movie, so his great performance is somewhat wasted. The romance is underdeveloped, too, but what else is new?

It's going to take some time for me to form a full opinion on BlacKkKlansman; I really don't know what to make of it yet. All I can say is that for a movie that's so clearly supposed to be modern-day society, it feels surprisingly disconnected",962sh1

e3xgwpr,"This movie is a strong 9 light 10 for me... There wasn't a bad performance, the directing was great,(couple or werid edits) and the story ia so unbelievably believable.

Now that I got the fact that this movie is really really great. I have to mention the fact that this movie isn't going to be seen enough by anyone who really needs to see a movie like this or be seen by any one in general. Whats even more sad is that most people that will see this movie won't actually listing or learn anything that the movie is trying to say.

Case in point, when the movie was over and everyone was leaving I didn't hear anyone talking about the message of the movie or that very real ending. (Now they could of talk more about it on their drives home)People were laughing and talking about the way Ron kept touching up his afro.

The way I've came to this conclusion that this is a possibility is because, while I was leaving out, two white folk in front of me were taking about how they couldn't understand why Patrice couldn't be with Ron at the end of the movie after he saves her form being blown up.(they pretty much were calling her a bad person)Even tho she explains why she couldn't in the sometime in the middile ln thr middle of the movie. 

I'll explain why I think she couldn't be with him... It's because Ron decided to stay on the police force even after he was beaten by cops, the chef pretty much tried to sabotage his investigation, and on top of other things he was order to destroy case files of the investigation so the public wouldn't know... Just my 2 cents.

I could also be a little bias because Patrice and people like her(Huey p newton,Angela davis,Malcolm X,The Black Panthers) are my heroes, so I sympathize with her position more than Ron's. Anyways great movie

yes, laughing at how pathetic and stupid the KKK are is fun, but what else does it have to say to us other than common sense? there's this attempt to link it up to modern politics at the end with real life footage, but it can hardly do that to a great effect when the only comparison drawn during the movie is a small chat lasting about 30 seconds between two characters somewhere in the movie. i think there was a way to tie a movie up to the footage at the end, but this definitely wasn't that movie.

i'm definitely hating on this movie more than it probably deserves to be, but it's disappointing to see something like this. it's lame and lazy, especially coming from spike lee (although, most of his new stuff has admittedly been lame and lazy). i still liked it for the most part, but i wouldn't want to watch it again. i'd even watch crazy rich asians over this again, and i hated that movie, but at least it had an idea it tried to convey.",962sh1

I know people are saying it isn't, but I'm gonna be honest, the issues that this movie portrayed just don't equate to what all those protests are over. It felt a bit shoehorned in. It is also kind of overshadowing some issues I had with the film itself. I felt there was no end game or goal for anyone involved.

Tbh it's so much to type out I just wanted to see if anyone else felt kind of awkward with the obvious biased news casting and cliche ""trump"" usage. I remember trump talking about how that ""both sides"" quote was taken out of context. Idk. I really fucking would have loved the movie without the news shit at the end. I got the point at the end, I didn't need real news footage shoved down my throat. Even just cutting to the upside down flag would have been awesome. ",962sh1

Unless I missed something I don’t understand what they were investigating the KKK for. The main character just kind of prank calls the local Klan chapter and the plot just uses that as its catalyst. I didn’t buy the love interest and the pacing was super choppy. Other than that the movie was pretty decent up until the final act where it totally just lost its flow. It seems to me they realized they didn’t have a “real” antagonist to put the cops up against so they came up with this stupid C4 plot line that, for me, just didn’t work. Politically, I’m a pretty left leaning guy and I agree with the message this movie was trying to portray but they really sacrificed the integrity of making a decent movie in order to push the agenda which left a bad taste in my mouth.

efs2w2g,"Just finished watching this movie with my friends as we're trying to watch all of the Best Picture nominees before the Oscars. I honestly don't understand why both this movie and Black Panther have received their nominations other than the political pandering that they are so blatantly showing. In my opinion this movie was just not good and certainly not deserving of its nomination.

&nbsp;

It's like it doesn't know what kind of a movie it wants to be and forgoes its identity in favor of the propaganda it wants to showcase. I mean seriously can Lee try to be at least somewhat subtle with his allusions to the modern political climate? It really does a disservice to the setting of his film because at every chance he gets it's like he's there saying ""SEE, THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW TOO IN CASE YOU MISSED IT!"" Come on, man. 

&nbsp;

The editing was also just...bad. Scenes with weight were either cut short or derailed by even more modern political commentary or by tone deaf humor. Another thing was the music which was really weird and always seemed like it was out of place. Also, the scenes with the asshole racist cop. Like ok, we've established him as the asshole racist cop who does really shitty things without rebuke and that sucks but what the fuck was that towards the end??? That scene made absolutely no sense and was just thrown in there to appease.....eh? I mean in scenes prior Driver had stated that they were a family, good or bad they stuck together. As shitty as that is, that's how it was established. But now all of a sudden everyone, including the racist captain, seemingly band together (out of nowhere) to collectively take that guy down? Like what in the fuck? Where did that even come from? 

&nbsp;

I'm tired of these whiny, attention-craving movies being nominated only because of their political pandering and not because of their actual merit. The Green Book was a much better movie at depicting some of the issues that black Americans (as well as other immigrants) went through in the past because it did so by weaving it into the story and showing the viewers, instead of continuously trying to bludgeon them with exhaustively unsubtle messaging.

&nbsp;

Many of you will probably come at me because you think I'm racist or insensitive or some stupid shit like that but I honestly couldn't give a shit less. I know what I am and what I'm not and I'm just here to discuss this movie for what it is. A movie. Not some enlightening, engaging, thought-provoking, shining example of progressive filmmaking. Which it is not.",962sh1

e480k9x,"Performances are 10/10 with Driver as standout for me.   John David Washington was good too, as  almost all the other actors who were perfectly cast. 

Reveal at end of movie with Duke on phone should have been used as the end scene, Real world footage was a little over the top. 

My biggest gripe is lack of white female role models.   While Spike Lee had plenty of black females to look up to in the movie, he had none white.  No females in PD.   All white females were clans supporters, very sad... for some reason he omitted any backstory or family scenes for  ‘Flip’ who would have been perfect to use. 

 Lastly, I ‘really want to see’ Spike Lee’s notes, his research for the clan while he was preparing to shoot. There were so many terrible Jew references it became annoying.   There is character specifically written to talk about nothing but horrible Jews, great holocaust, etc every time he was on screen, this is not overstated.   Spike has a history with Jewish depictions and has been accused by ADL in the past, though it was a long time ago.  Flip’s character could have been written a little stronger.  I’ll just leave it there....

ef5f2hi,"A very small part of the movie I had a question about (and curious to see if Spike Lee had done this purposely)

Towards the end of the film the ""real"" Ron Stallworth asks to take his picture with David Duke and some other official.

He puts his arms around Duke/official right when the picture is taken and both have a quick reaction of disgust and anger.

Duke asks Stallworth what he just did in a somewhat threatening manner to which Stallworth responds even ""laying a finger on a law enforcement member can lead to 5 years in jail""

Isn't it somewhat ironic that Stallworth put his hands on Duke initially & that's what led to Duke being upset since he was more than willing to take the photo with Stallworth in the first place?

Now I know some will respond with ""well, that how racist officers protect themselves when they attack blacks"" but this situation can't really be compared to that.

It didnt have a coherent story or plot and too much useless dialog some of it could be deep on its own as clips but as a movie itself was all over the place. So I can see why it has 1/10s from people, I hate trailers that lie to you about a movie.

They mentioned how there was no cross burnings the entire time.  Even during the scene when they were planning to burn the cross all of the members were in regular clothes and not robes.

As soon as the case ended it went back to robes and cross burning and thats all we saw. Covered and nameless.  The reflection off the person eyes.

> When Patrice rejects Ron at the end of the film because of her preconceived notions of police officers, I thought this brought this viewpoint home well. And even then, Spike Lee still keeps her perceptions in relative check when compared to the backwards beliefs and actions of the KKK.

Another good observation. I also thought it was a bit radical for Patrice to reject him because of his job, as well as her lumping every officer into one category.

- Stallworth was a beat cop for over a year before he was given the assignment to observe the Carmichael speech. He wasn't plucked directly out of Records like the movie depicts. However, Records was his first department and it was still earlier than an officer would've been normally considered for Detective. There's a pretty funny story about how the hat he was issued was too small, and when he complained they told him to cut his afro. So he instead just perched this tiny hat on top of it. 

- Flip wasn't Jewish, and wasn't in as much danger of discovery as the movie depicts.

- The planned attack involved the firebombing of a gay bar and Stallworth was never particularly involved with a local Black Liberation movement (at least at that time)

- Stallworth never outed himself to David Duke. Duke didn't find out Stallworth was black until a reporter contacted him in 2006 to cooberate Stallworth's story.",962sh1

e7yy1ll,"I'm not disagreeing with you, but these are my 2 cents on the explanation of two of your points:

1. Felix was concocting a plan to oust Flip at the right time, but the one thing that could distract him just so happened to appear at that moment. He became so tied up emotionally in dealing with his wife that he lost sight of the real situation at hand. Perfectly human thing to do.

2. Ron called instead of whitey because he was and is a bit of a loose cannon, and as Flip said earlier in the film: It's a crusade for him. He'll take any chance to stick it to the KKK, whether that's talking to the grand wizard on the phone or taking a cuddly photo with him... ",962sh1

Really? Because that was one of the more realistic parts for me. He was the only black cop, yet they still beat the shit out of him because they trusted the fat racist bitch more than a fellow cop. I'm sure that happened plenty in that time when black cops were just starting to get integrated into the police force.",962sh1
e4e9kka,"Probably for two reasons. One, Ron probably loved the irony of being a black officer and infiltrating the klan. Two, Ron probably was in a better position to gain intelligence on the phone and direct Flip in the field. Ron has been black his whole life and likely experienced the personalities of klan members/racists first hand many times.

I'm Finnish and a big part of why I went to watch the film was because Jasper Pääkkönen (Felix, the doubtful nazi) was in a major role. I've never before seen a Finn in a major role in a big film like this. But he was not what was on top of my mind after leaving the theater. I have read news about US events especially here on reddit, but the ending made it so much more tangible and moving.

I'm also a huge Bob Dylan fan. In an interview, he said something along the lines of: ""Slavery ruined America, and I don't think it can ever heal."" I didn't quite understand that, but this film cleared it up at least a bit. The wounds from that are still so deep. America could be such a beautiful country, and is in many ways, with so many different nationalities gathered enjoying the huge land. But it might be true that the wounds that slavery created are really still messing that up.

We have discussion about immigrants and therefore racism too a lot now here in Finland with the crisis situation, and Sweden, our ""big brother"", getting swamped by its own migration policies. So it is a interesting, and scary time. But the situation in US is so different. We don't have a national trauma like that. We do have our own stuff though.

The actor Jasper Pääkkönen (Felix) had talked about his exchange experience in Baltimore with Lee. He had wanted to take his friend, a black girl to the prom, but his host family and lots of other people were strongly opposed to that. It's crazy, in Finland there might be racism and especially in those times, say 20 years ago, we had so little black people that some people might have acted strangely towards them. But if one has been living with the community for a long time it would never come to question that they would be treated so differently because of their skin colour. So Jasper had hard time believing what he experienced there.",962sh1

I was involved in a Spike Lee movie not too long ago. It played the festival circuit and was getting good reviews- sits in the high 80s on RT. I was looking at the imdb a lot because it was exciting to me to have been involved in one of Spike's movies, and the day before the trailer dropped the movie was sitting at around an 8.4 on imdb. Few votes because not many people had seen it, probably five or six dozen people across a couple of screenings at two festivals. Then the trailer dropped. The day after the trailer dropped, I looked at the imdb score, and it had plummeted to a 3.8, because a ton of people had rated it a 1. There hadn't been any new screenings, the movie hadn't had a wide release yet, but suddenly all these people were of the opinion that it was an irredeemable piece of shit. Because it was a Spike Lee movie and it clearly dealt with race. 

So when people- some of whom are in this thread -complain that they're not ""allowed"" to dislike this movie because people will say they're racist, I think about that. The disingenuous way we talk about movies like this, and how it cuts both ways. ",962sh1

(I also had heard from another friend with similar criticisms that the ending was related to Charlottesville, so that was somewhat running in the back of my mind while watching.)

I agree that as far as highlighting the notion that the majority of white Americans benefit from / are complicit in white supremacy - and in turn getting white audience members to think about their own relationship to that power - the movie's impact is dubious. As you said, that conversation is already happening and to that end it's hard to see this having a huge impact on that particular part of the dialogue around racism.

On the other hand, though, I think Spike did a good job of highlighting throughout the film the disconnect between the ludicrousness of the people who espouse these ideas and the dangerous real-life repercussions they have. Most of the KKK members we see onscreen are easy to laugh at... the bumbling alcoholic, the trying-so-hard-to-please wife, and of course David Duke himself whose last scene is being left dumbstruck while the officers crack up on the other side of the phone. To this end, the last few scenes felt to me more along the lines of 'laugh at the people with the ideas all you want... but look at how real the problems the ideas cause still are.' And I think *that* is a slightly different conversation, but one that's also worth having or at least being more aware of. A lot of non-racist white folks look down on bigots as ignorant or uncultured and dismiss them, but that doesn't mean they go away. So I almost took Spike's larger point being: short-term wins and pats-on-the-back can feel great, but, like the real Ron, we have to be constantly and consciously doing our part and not underestimating or overlooking the threat if we want real change. Or, to quote Phife Dawg, ""troublesome times kid, no time for comedy."" 

Side Note 1: Thought Spike did a solid job of showing how *some* of the divisiveness of the ideologies of black groups can be misled or ineffective while, as you said, pointing out the context and degree of severity that make them completely different from actual hate groups. 'Black power' and 'white power' are not the same thing at all. But, marrying yourself to the ideology that *everyone* on the 'other side' (i.e. all cops) is bad (i.e. corrupt pigs) is still deepening division where there doesn't necessarily need to be any, or at least as much. As a person of color (non-black), I liked how touched on that without furthering the false dichotomy you pointed out. 

Side Note 2: Loved the dolly shot near the end! ",962sh1
e5v4vf2,"It did not at all need the recent real life images to deliver it's point. It needed those images to highlight the fact that the point is still relevant. This is not just history. It's a warning. 

Your argument that the people were portrayed unrealistically is a pile of garbage. The Black Liberation movement was portrayed by regular looking black people, most of whom never said a word, regardless of how the KKK was portrayed. Even if the KKK was portrayed as dumb alcoholics, that would just follow the common film trope of making the villain look bad.

This. It's a really good film, but it's disjointed and drags a bit.

\* Ron Stallworth enlists in the Colorado Springs PD, with the sargeant warning him during his initial interview that he may get hassle for being the first black officer they've ever had.

\* Ron initially being stuck in the file room and other people asking him for files. The other officers have the habit of referring to the perpetrators as ""toads"", and Ron gets annoyed at this at one point and insists that they are human beings.

It was really baffling given the rest of the movie.

It wasn't a way of showing they were sides of the same coin, but it's to show the contrast in what it means to say ""white power"" vs what it means to say ""black power"". To say ""black power"" is to stand up and fight oppression. To say ""white power"" *is* oppression. It's to show that there is history and context behind both sayings, proving to those who think they mean similar things that that line of thinking couldn't be further from the truth.",962sh1
e4o4xj3,"Agreed this movie was a missed opportunity on many levels. Great story ripe with interesting themes and subjects, but the execution was poor and the messaging was muddled. The editing (some really bizzare choice here as you mentioned), acting (driver excluded), script and direction were all subpar in my opinion. 

A key issue of the film is it lacks any real conflict, tension, or drama. The Nazis characters are such losers that it's hard to find any scene with them compelling or interesting. They are not serious to be frightening or outrageous enough to be funny. The protagonist doesn't really go through any change or have a true arc.

The one standout scene of the film is early on at the black students event. This scene is compelling for three reasons: 1. some of the messages in the speech may be a bit controversial or make the film audience uncomfortable where as the rest of the movie is very safe / straightforward message that racism is bad. 2. The main character is going through a bit of internal dilemma and is conflicted on how to feel about black people resisting and potentially using violence as a means. It would be great if the rest of the film continued to focus on this internal conflict but it gets pretty much tossed aside. 3. stylistically this was pretty cool as well the close ups and montage of faces in the crowd was unique and well done. 

I didn't find it all that funny or even humurous - the crowd had 2 or 3 chuckles but that was about it. The action / chase scenes if you can call them that were just goofy and dull. 

I guess other people found this a lot funnier otherwise not sure what the appeal of this movie is. Lame 5/10 for me as well.",962sh1

Like I know Trump sucks, I am staunchly against him, so you don't need that hamfisted moment in there to make it explicit. Art should stand on its own and help you draw conclusions on your own of meaning. The editing felt like a Spike Lee joint through and through, that can just be his style with the cuts and seeing things twice just from a different angle.

A few bits of the dinner was based on real life like the real Ron being Duke's security and taking the poloroid, but all the bomb stuff was added in and it absolutely felt like the writers were just shoving in as many of the few real tidbits that they forgot about their own plot. Felix figures out the whole thing as soon as Ron and Flip walk in and has a ton of time to say something about it but instead decides now is the best time to give his wife the bomb IN FRONT OF THE COPS HE KNOWS ABOUT NOW? I couldn't tell if the writing was just that bad or if the editing caused some of the issue because it felt at times that portions of scenes had been edited in the wrong order or plot points were partially cut out while leaving things in like the shot gun or Felix seeing Flip's deadeye aim after missing Ron's car.

I think he's instead trying to interrogate, ""What about our society allows the KKK to continue to exist?"" and the answer to that isn't as simple as ""cartoonish-seeming David Duke-level racists,"" though obviously that's a part of it. The movie shows the klan as laughably incompetent - Ron finds them by answering a newspaper ad, for fuck's sake - but also how the structures of power in society work to protect them despite everything: most of the other cops in Ron's unit aren't quite as racist as the klan but would be fine with turning a blind eye to them, Ron has to work security detail for Duke, the klansman's wife nearly succeeds in getting away by invoking stereotypes of white victimhood and aggressive black men, and just as the cops succeed their funding gets cut off because their mission is deemed ""unimportant,"" and so on. The point isn't to understand why people are racist, it's to show how they're empowered to be so.

e43ct9k,">And theeeen the present day footage, showing Neo nazi rallies and whatnot. Let me tell you why this was one of, if not the stupidest decision of the entire movie. Everyone knows the KKK is bad and we dont need a movie to ridicule them, they do that enough on their own. But even if you believe that this should be done, its counter productive. The KKK presence had greatly reduced in the 21st century UNTIL they started getting attention again and they are now re surging. The only thing this does encourage more KKK and neo nazi activity. Lindsey Ellis has a great video on this subject that I'd recommend anyone watch.

This is ridiculous. The Klan isn't ""resurging"" because people are talking about them. They're ""resurging"" because there's a political apparatus again that has, at the very least, tries to play the both-sides game between the KKK and anti-racist activist groups and, at the worst, have actively encouraged these kinds of views. The fact that we have obscured the Klan by writing them off as a historical artifact is part of the reason they're starting to gain popularity in some circles. That many have adopted a ""That wouldn't ever happen again"" attitude has allowed that wound to fester.

And the fact of the matter is that even before *everyone* started talking about it and bringing it to attention, the Klan has been building an unnoticed presence anyway. I live in a small town in Texas. There is a mainly black church some miles away from me, made up of refugees from Hurricane Katrina. Not too long after they established a church, there was a cross burning. I drive by that church every day to get to work and you can still see where it charred the sign.

In Oklahoma, Texas and other places in the south, it's been discovered that Klan members are on police forces. This dovetails with something that is important to Ron's real life story: his investigation led to the US government finding that there was Klan in the military and in law enforcement in this country. The fact of the matter is that it's still true. And that fact needs to be talked about and it needs to be brought to light.

The naive part of your post is that you're blaming Spike Lee and others who are trying to ring the alarm bell on this issue, with the ones being responsible for it. But that racist motherfucker didn't kill Heather Hayer because everyone else was talking about the Klan. He killed her because of his own beliefs and his own motivations, which have fuck all to do with the fact that people are talking about the fact that there are pieces of shit like him in this country that present a real danger to people all across the nation.",962sh1
e43ce8f,"I hundred percent agree with you for some of the editing and music choices. I guess for me for most of your writing criticisms I would need to know the differences between what actually happened and what was changed for the film.

The one Trump reference that you specifically quote I am with you on that was hamfisted. But a lot of the ""America First"" stuff and the MAGA stuff that Trump messages was lifted directly from David Duke and the KKK so there again if that is what happened and that's what they said then they can't and shouldn't change that.

 I think it is impossible to enter this movie and expect anything different at least on a political level than what was shown.

As for the digs at Trump and the ending-ending, I thought they were perfectly fine and in line with the theme of the film as a whole as well as Spike Lee's style of filmmaking - he's not going to be subtle, ever. This film succeeded in depicting the KKK, but more importantly, white supremacy in general, as both ridiculous in ideology but also as serious threats, which is what we saw with the events in Charlottesville not so long ago.

You want to dig your head in the sand and pretend that racism died a long time ago and that this is just a film depicting things of the past? You should  re-watch those clips of the young white men with tiki torches, Nazi banners, and KKK & Confederate flags and think again.",962sh1

Depending on how strict the branch of Judaism in question is, and how conservative the parent(s) is/are, and whether or not they are both Jewish, the child(ren) may or may not be raised in the traditional Jewish culture, community, and oral tradition. In the case of ""mixed religion couples"", which happens more often nowadays, children are typically not really raised to be part of a staunch, or conservative, Jewish identity. 

This is also frequent in America, where people tend to identify as ""American first, and Jewish second"". In the case of my ex, by Jewish standards, he's Jewish, as his mother is an ethnic Eastern European Jewish woman. However, he was never really ""raised Jewish"", and his family celebrated both Hannukkah and Christmas growing up, as his father was a Roman Catholic.

In the case of the ""Jewish"" Flip Zimmerman, [who is largely a fictional persona and character devised by Spike Lee](https://www.bustle.com/p/where-is-flip-zimmerman-in-2018-the-blackkklansman-character-played-a-key-role-in-a-wild-true-story-10015280), his role in the film, as well as Adam Driver's portrayal, is likely meant to serve as [juxaposition](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/juxtaposition) for, and a foil to, John David Washington's black protagonist, Ron Stallworth. This is very common to see in movies that star two leads.

Also see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foil_(literature)

However, in the film, it does not appear that Driver's Zimmerman was raised in a strict conservative, or Orthodox, Jewish environment growing up...hence, why he doesn't think about it much, until Stallworth brings it up in relation to prejudice. This appears meant to directly compare to, and contrast with, Washington's portrayal of Stallworth as a member of a minority group facing prejudice in America (i.e. African-Americans).",962sh1

So just like the CIA never did research and truly get to know MLK and deemed him a Terrorist and even a communist. You are doing the exact same thing with not doing research and getting to know what the black panthers were about and deem them as violent.

It's the police force that protects one of their own even though they know he is racist and it hurts community relations. It's the politicians that use racial resentment to gain power. It's not only the racist KKK members but their families that support their believes.

In the movie it was really only a few rogues that tried to commit violence but there were tons of people that helped maintain that hatred that still afflicts us to this day.

As **overt** racism in the US is much rarer than it was a few decades ago, it is tempting to take a look at the present day US, give ourselves a pat on the back, and go on living life thinking to ourselves that racism is a problem of the past. All of the parallels that Spike Lee draws between the past and the present are meant to tell the audience that we really haven't progressed as far as we may think to ourselves. Police brutality, white supremacy groups, dog-whistle politics, and racism all take similar forms in the film as they do today. 

And just to make it REALLY clear, Spike Lee uses footage from a white supremacist/neo-nazi rally just **last year** that resulted in the death of a counter-protester when one of the neo-nazis got into a car and drove into a crowd of counter-protesters, just to drive home how white supremacists are still a major threat to America.

I think, where this film could have been ham-fisted throughout, it instead built to the shocking crescendo you mentioned by showcasing how easy it is to fall down the ""white power"" rabbit hole.  A hole that is so well-camouflaged, that it's hard to tell the difference between a nationalistic ""America First"" and ""Whites Only GTFO"" mentality.    

I found it interesting that it doesn't necessarily ""color-shame"" white people so much as it pushes the central core idea of the ""ALL THE POWER TO ALL THE PEOPLE"" movement.  I thought the film had a  well-thought-out structure and a build-up that made it easy for some details to be overlooked. 
 Even moments like when Adam Driver's non-secular character - who is of Jewish descent - realizes he's hated for something he's never even thought of practicing.  Or when the KKK are having their living room meeting and Connie (the wife) interjects with a violent idea that she feels would ""help the cause"".  They dismiss her almost outright, not because the idea isn't one they'd like to embrace but because in their world even women should not speak unless spoken to.  These moments are marked with a certain soft cadence and subtlety that felt to me to be the mark of masterful storytelling.

Sure a good amount of the film takes aim at Trump - even as far as having an entire chunk of dialogue mentioning that the KKK will eventually elect someone to the white house with the same ideals as them - but in the end, it's not wrong.  It shows that having a racist politician elected is not only a possibility, it's an actual fact.  David Duke embodied that idea.  He embraced it.  And because he is arguably the most well-known white supremacist in American history he'd never rise to such a rank as POTUS, but he'd help put someone in that office that shared his beliefs.  And all under the shrowd of ""making America great again"".

I think this film is the most important film of the year, and possibly the last decade.  Its only shortcoming, in my opinion, is its marketing presentation and title.  Sure it's clever and provocative, but it's also pushing away the people that need to see it the most.  People that don't necessarily project racist ideals in their daily life but are lost, confused, and searching for what they feel is relevance while their country is ""slipping from their fingers"" - even if it actually isn't.  Everyone needs to see this movie.  Unfortunately there are those that never will.  ",962sh1
e49fzq1,"So well put. I was focused on every word you wrote, and sadly that's rare for my impatient self. 

> Spike Lee just beat us over the head with these parallels from the getgo of the film.

I felt this immediately when Ron and another officer (I forgot who) were talking about the Klan and the point was made that the Klan was trying a newer, more subtle approach to their organization, the intention of which was to *eventually* infiltrate the power of the USA, maybe even up to the president. I knew this was a jab at Trump and nodded my head in agreement; people behind me were ""hmm""ing their agreement. But then Ron kept going. 

""What? No way there would ever be a **racist** president who mirrors **the ideals of the KKK**. The **good-natured American people** would never **elect a man such as that to public office one day**.""

I expected them to turn to the camera for a whole minute. I'm not a Trump supporter but my goodness, we get it. 

> Yet every white supremacist character in the film is a fucking moron!

I mean, pretty much, yeah, but I don't think that's a 100% truth. I really liked how the local chapter leader was a nice, well spoken man. I think that character did a good job of humanizing real life bigotry. Shoot, if he sat next to me at a bar and hid his racism, I'd probably have a really good, long conversation and shake his hand before parting ways. It effectively showed how evil isn't always an either/or caricature. But otherwise yes, the other guys were either Hitler Lite or Elmer Fudd with 23 chromosomes.",962sh1

eewxmm4,"I thought the ending \_felt\_ like propaganda at first, too. But, I realized that it was actually all a part of the movie's greater message and that the footage was chosen rather coherently and with purpose. It was meant to show how while so much has changed since the time where the main plot takes place, that a lot hasn't. It does this by showing modern day racists and how they show their beliefs in similar ways to the old school Klan with marches, and to put the icing on the cake, they show David Duke in modern day speaking publicly, even after the fuck up that happened with his Klan in the movie. 

Now, I would have given it a solid 9/10 if it had a real ending after the modern day stuff. The fever dream of a scene really threw me off and left me blue balled. It felt like the movie was missing 20 minutes. ",962sh1

Except we didn't beat them, they're still out there, they're killing people, they're calling for genocide, and they are trying, always trying, to take power in this country.

When I watched the film, I did briefly have a similar thought about midway through watching the film.

What I meant by that was that even though I had certainly heard my fair share of racist comments in my upbringing, people weren't dropping N bombs every conversation and talking about murders and lynch's. I thought BlacKkKlansman was taking too many liberties in how it was depicted regular, every day, behind the scenes White Racism. 

Then the end of the movie happened.

Those protests, David Duke, Heather Heyer. It hit me like a ton of bricks just how wrong I was to have those feelings- those conversations are going on, just not where I was, because, you know, I'm not racist, so I'm not drawn to racist crowds, or here those behind-closed-doors conversations. But they're happening. Probably right next door, or down the street.

And it hits like a bag of bricks that I don't have to live everyday knowing I'm the target of an anonymous hate group. It hit that I don't have to live like that, just like my father didn't in 1979, just like my children won't in 2039.

YES, the film does show that there ARE two sides (the scene switching between the KKK ritual and the speech given at the black student union very clearly demonstrates this) but the film very, very clearly does NOT say that they are equal. They are just opposed. Which, no shit. It's the fucking KKK.

At both points in time, you have racist people being protected by those in power, at least allowing the racists to skirt by unaffected.

Esp as a white person it's really easy to think ""yeah nobody's burning crosses and marching in white hoods anymore look how far the black liberation movement has come"" but immediately going from that to modern days acts of equivalent violence (some that duke endorsed himself) was super heavy. I can't remember the exact wording of it but there's that little bit earlier in the movie when Ron's on the phone with Duke and he says something to the effect of ""make America great again"" and it had a very similar weight ",962sh1
e3xmcyy,"The ending worked for me because you spent the majority of the movie laughing at the KKK. Yes, it's shown that they're willing (and wanting) to be violent, but the last you see of them in the story proper is Ron taking the piss out of David Duke on the phone. The coda serves to remind you that, yeah, these people are total buffoons but they are to this day a very real threat. 

It's not subtle, but from the opening scene of the movie it's 100% clear that Spike Lee is not remotely interested in even trying to be subtle. And for this material, I think it's a valid choice. ",962sh1
e4yfs2h,"The ending to me was a perfect culmination of the themes throughout the movie. Black characters telling Ron to wake up, the sergeant telling him ""as a black man, you can't be that naïve?"".

He also gets heartbroken by the black actors in the film, Hattie McDaniel in particular, who won an Oscar for the film but wasn’t even allowed to be at the ceremony to receive it. This is why he acknowledges her in the film in the scene with the phone call to David Duke. He also said this is what they (white people) do to us. That’s how they treat us (black people). He went onto how he also added them to the film because they are some of the highest regarded films in movie history, especially GWTW, and he wants us to see how GWTW is one of the “best films” ever made when it’s one of the most racist and hurtful toward black people. 

Birth of a Nation ISSSSS History itself. So he had to include it because of its history and meaning to America and the Klan. 

He said that when he finally met the real Ron Stallworth he asked him how did the Klan never realize that the voice over the phone was not the same of the person they were meeting and Ron told him he would tell them he has allergies etc. and they always believed it. This is why he had that in the film. He then said they are stupid motherfuckers but stupid motherfuckers can be deadly motherfuckers and we need to always be alert and cautious. 

He also acknowledged the people complaining about the portrayal of the Klansman, and how they were portrayed as cliche stereotypes and Hillbilly’s but he did it cause this is what many of them were actually like.

The talking points, the rhetoric, the catch phrases and mottos they used 40, 50, 60 years ago, they all still exist today. I even see them on Reddit on a consistent basis. Hearing the bits where David Duke spoke of modern America being ""anti-white"" and the impending white genocide, all I could think of was the number of times I've seen that exact rhetoric spouted on reddit and other social media, and when you put two and two together, you realize these are all literally KKK talking points. That *doesn't* mean that the people spouting those things are KKK, but it *does* mean that the KKK has managed to effectively get common folk repeating and spreading that narrative for them.

As the film progressed, hearing the group chant ""America first"" and saying things like ""we are going to make America great,"" just continued to expose my discomfort - like a long, drawn out shot at the doctor's office. But like a shot, it was a necessary discomfort. 

By the very end, seeing the transition from the cross burning as the KKK members chanted ""blood and soil"" to modern day Charlottesville where, just one year ago, neo-nazis were chanting that *same* thing - it was an extremely sobering moment, like a cold, clean slap across the face. By the time Heather Heyer's picture came up on the screen, as others in this thread have said, I'm pretty sure you could hear a pin drop in the theater.

You've always been raised being told to trust the police, that they will help you, to call them when you're in danger. That's simply just now how these people experienced their lives. In many places like that, in that time period, cops did not help black people, they harmed them. Like you saw with her getting pulled over. They could do whatever they want, and with a racist system backing them up, there was absolutely no accountability. A black person running from being lynched likely would not be saved if they found a cop,  the cop would probably capture them and hand them over. 

So to follow that, the idea of working and aiding that organization would be disgusting. You were raised seeing and experiencing police, by and large, as a group that help people - these people lived lives where they *very much were not*. It only makes sense she'd have a problem with it. ",962sh1

A simple Google search will show you the nazi-sympathizing America First Committee of the 1940s and result in dozens of pictures of Klan members at rallies using the America First slogan on signs back in the 1920s. The guy didn't even create MAGA himself, he stole it from Reagan (and we all know how his policies turned out). That aside, it would  (and back then did) still apply because in the kkk saying make America great again, great *again* for **whom** exactly?

2. The contrived storytelling feeds into the my quibble with how they introduced him. It was basically a screenwriting 101 thing that is pretty arbitrary and esoteric but still necessary when introducing characters. It’s spike lee’s Joint and he can run it however he pleases. That’s why I said it was just a quibble and not a flaw. Thanks for your thoughts...",962sh1

eetlx16,"I felt he felt closer to being white than jewish and eventually bought into the KKK nonsense. Towards the end when Ron is on the phone telling the KKK that he was black or he had tricked them (maybe he was talking to David Duke, I don’t recall), two cops near his desk couldn’t stop laughing and he had to hush them. Flip was leaning on his desk next to him with his back to us, but I noticed there was no reaction from him. Basically Flip’s reaction was hidden from the audience whereas we can see the other two cops laugh. 
In the movie, Spike Lee has taken a lot of liberties with Flip’s character. The real cop who went in as “White Ron” was not named Flip (interesting choice of name by Spike... cuz Flip flipped in the end), was not jewish, and actually had a very small role in this KKK case. Most of the interactions happened on the phone with the real Ron and the KKK. Also, Flip’s identity was never revealed in real life. ",962sh1
ef7z6tl,"Almost no invention is singular. Many things were simultaneously, or almost simultaneously, invented in multiple places, and history just settled on one name (telephone is a great example of this, gunpowder another). Inventions happen when circumstances and necessary preconditions happen, and then its often just a matter of time.

As such, I personally dont think any single person is so incredibly important and necessary to our species to be valuable regardless of their actions.

However, I agree that racism is actually not the big boogeyman its made out to be, turning everyone into a foam-at-the-mouth KKK lunatic. Also, what constitutes racism (benevolent racism, as also mentioend in the movie) is a complex topic and many kinds of racism dont actually cause mayhem like in this movie. 

But I do believe that somebody being racist, and propagating this, is a burden on society because society suffers and doesnt benefit from spreading racism. It makes so many thing unnecessarily more difficult, based on an entirely irrational bogus issue.

Let me also present something ""philosophical"" to you. Racism isn't just white people hating blacks. It isn't that clear cut which **WAAAAY** too many people believe it to be. Anyone (regardless of what race they are) can be a racist and often are. 

Blacks can hate whites, Asians can hate Hispanics, Hispanics can hate Indians, etc.......etc..........etc.",962sh1

e3y5l9p,"It showed the extremists on both sides, the White Supremacists were rightfully vilified & Ron questions the Black College Group when they continue to call all cops pigs, that the revolution & uprising is coming.  Most of the movie though is about unity, you have a white cop & a black cop working together to take down White Supremacists.  Even though Flip is Jewish, he has a nice moment explaining that he wasn't raised Jewish, that this was the first time he's ever thought about his heritage, its what keeps him engaged to staying in character & continuing the investigation of  the KKK chapter.  You see all the other detectives begin to warm up to Ron as the investigation continues, you see the frustration & disappointment in everyone's face when the chief shuts the investigation down.  It doesn't slap you over the head with all this, but the film promotes teamwork, & shows that there are good men on the police force, even though there are a few bad apples (the racist cop I'm blanking on his name).

e41q8pf,"Thanks for this response, it's really interesting to get a perspective from Finland. I saw the Finnish name in the credits and I actually had no idea which actor it was. I think he did very well.

That's interesting that Jasper has that experience, but I guess not all that surprising. I think it's a little surprising that the sort of people to take in an exchange student would have that mindset. My experience in this country is that the composition of people varies greatly from state to state, and from town to town, and to me one of the biggest obstacles to the elimination of racism is how vast the nation is, and how easy it is to become isolated. I came from a state in the North, and in the rural area I lived in there were perhaps 10 or 20 non white students in my school of 800 or so. So in some areas, there really hasn't been integration much like how you describe Finland back then.

However, having grown up rarely interacting with people of different races, all it takes is getting a job and living a life in a relatively populated area to drastically reduce the possibility of someone becoming or remaining racist. I even had a little racial anxiety I think, not from hatred or fear, but from meeting people that I may have thought were different, and not knowing how to approach people. But that dissipated as soon as I moved to a more populated area and got to know people with different backgrounds.

I think the breeding ground for hate is fear, and people just fear what they don't know. And unfortunately the expansiveness and segregation in this country means a lot of people don't get to know people from different places, or with different complexions.

I enjoyed a comment I read saying that the poster would like to talk to a racist after they watched the movie. I feel like I would too, I don't comprehend how someone could see Ron and not like him. And that's all it takes I think, is being friends or admiring someone that's different from you.

",962sh1
e4c5sje,"The well done dolly shot and catatonic expressions (a nod toward Get Out's sunken place?) definitely serves to underscore the transition between the film's happy ending and the reality at large in contemporary America, as you were saying. I didn't think of it this way until I read your comment and it actually reduces some of my disorientation from that abrupt change in tone.

I guess the question that lingers for me is what to do with this information. White supremacy in 2018 is different than the reactionaries to integration of the 60's and 70's which is of course different than the racism of the Klan's resurgence in the first part of the 20th century. The FBI is no longer openly hostile to civil rights organizers (thinking King and COINTEL pro here) nor are they indifferent to hate crimes. Based on the FBI's own data white supremacy appears as the biggest threat to the nation's security. Pop culture is swinging hard toward empowerment narratives, whether sincere or exploitative.

Nonetheless we have President America First. Other than vote him out/impeach, it's hard to know what to do with a president who lacks the moral compass to unequivocally condemn nazi's. And even if we succeed there, what do we do with his supporters, many of whom want to preserve some hard-line, yet not overtly racist, idea of nationality and culture? Because in a way, Trump was right when he said ""they're not all nazi's."" Some nationalists want to maintain their current forms of economic and cultural indifference, despite extreme racial disparities and injustices. Others are OK with merely defending a broader cultural homogeneity. All of those ideas are obviously shit. But that doesn't necessarily make them nazi ideas. 

One of the challenges I see for the resistance is the ability to accurately characterize those shit ideas in order to better combat them. More importantly, I'd like to see the resistance stand for policies that will benefit working class communities, both of color and without. I worry that too many of us now relate to Patrice's sentiment of being American and black as mutually exclusive. Her view was that maybe we should shed the identity that puts us in the same circle with people we vehemently disagree with (or attribute as disagreeing with us - American identity) and only take refuge in a community with whom we share immutable traits.  That position is understandable, but I think ultimately counterproductive. Does the film offer any concrete stance on this dilemma?

I'd like to think Lee wants the system to work the way it's supposed to, but doesn't have high hopes. If only having recorded proof of wrongdoing was enough to guarantee police accountability. Christ. At least the movie is making a bit more sense to me now.

It was an explicit reminder to the audience that ""this event happened, burn it into your minds, don't get complacent, never forget it"" - I think walking out of the theater with that being the last thing burned in your mind over, instead, the grand reveal to Duke, was intended to be memorable and to get people talking and to ""wake up"" - and I'd say it worked ",962sh1

e48uc8q,"Yeah, and I'll say that whether it works or not for the individual viewer, it was obviously a choice he made. It wasn't some sort of poor execution or editing, it was very much exactly what he wanted to put on film and so you can hardly criticize it from a technical standpoint.

e42qycp,"I mean, in this movie it's not quite as noticeable, although I think of the talk given at the beginning of the movie where the speaker talks about killing racist cops, and seems to be at least hinting towards acts of violence as protest. Don't get me wrong, I don't think racist cops have a place in our hearts, but I don't approve of violence against others, it doesn't really solve anything. 

This movie wasn't meant to shine a light on all the bad outliers of the Black Power movement, it was to tell a story of an infiltration of the KKK. However, you can draw parallels between the extremes we have today and the groups in the movies. What started out as reasonable protest back in the civil Rights movement has morphed into some cases into an ugly beast that does more harm and good to its cause, while the racists in America have stayed as ugly if not uglier. 

I get my analogy is almost certainly imperfect, but the message I got overall is that real change happens when people work together across groups and do so in a civil and strategic way.

The ending is supposed to be a subversion of the normal movie ending.  Normally in a movie they get the bad guys, we have a hero, everything is resolved and then the credits roll.  It was supposed to be a cheap throwaway moment.  The ending is a mockery of the talking point that we live in a post civil rights era so obviously racism is over and we can all forget about the long complicated race relations mess because everyone is equal and the past is past.

On top of this, he worked closely with Ron throughout the film, became his friend, and helped catch the racist cop at the end.

To make Flip a member of the KKK would totally kill his character development up to that point, and would also be a stupid statement to make.

edit: I was going to say that the KKK already figured out he was an undercover cop, but then I remember that this isn't true.

That old dude is Harry Belafonte. Not only was he an important part of the civil rights movement he was the guy who told Tarantino that he had to make Django.

I think that if anything, the message was we need to all band together against hate in a time like this, which is a phenomenal message especially when the nation is as divided as it is now, but I feel like the movie avoided any views or perspectives personal to Spike Lee and instead kept it very surface level in order to get a clear message across to a lot of people.

The film was about how bad the KKK and bad police racism or actions. I think a scene where they see Stallworth in 2018 and him getting mistreated by some KKK dude or maybe him seeing what happened in Charlottesville would be much better.

Honestly her deciding to blanket hate all cops just because one or two mistreated her makes her sound a lot like a racist who hate all people of a given race just because of one or two who did something bad (like how people hated Muslims after 9/11), and that two-facedness makes me really dislike her.

If she was still uneasy with the cops and didn’t really trust them because of what happened to her, I’d 100% get it...but that wasn’t the case. She still thought of them all as the enemy, and straight up told Ron if he didn’t quit then he’s the enemy too despite the fact that he just saved her life and had been nothing but kind to her the whole movie.

The bombing and the bar scene were the perfect opportunities for her to grow and realize that not all cops are bad, but instead she decided to turn her back on it and embrace the narrow-minded hate, much like the organization she had devoted her life to fight.",962sh1

Since spike is a legend in his craft, to feel similarly about this movie at this stage in his career was slightly disappointing. Those subtle filmmaking aspects don’t take away from the movie at all until they start to add up and become more glaring over the course of the movie. With “Blindspotting,” they did not affect the movie for me, whereas as they did detract slightly for “blackkklansman”.",962sh1

White Power is about *supremacy*. They feel they are genetically superior, you can't dispute it! And they feel they need to cleanse the country, ""*founded exclusively by white men*"", of inferior races (*especially black people and jewish*).

That's what I didn't like about the movie. The movie didnt know what it was.
Is it supposed to be funny or serious.l? Are we supposed to fear these bigots or not take them seriously? Most of them were incompetent and clutz. I never feared for the lives of any of the characters. Not even when the big lady was placing the bomb. I knew she would fuck it up. 

So the whole movie I couldn't take seriously and then at the end they show those clips of BLM.

I'd definitely agree that he doesn't really point to any specific path forward to progress, and more broadly that it's hard to see exactly what that would even be with how increasingly deep and nuanced the questions we're facing are. I guess my interpretation - and this could definitely just be me projecting my own thoughts onto what Spike made - is that the 'path forward' begins more with perception and ideology. He's always been a big proponent of how people should 'wake up,' and to me the underlying suggestion is that there *are* no concrete solutions until that happens on a larger scale. That the only productive conversation is one where all parties involved are aware, focused on progress, and don't fall into groupthink or absolutes. 

I mean, if there's anyone from the film you'd want to emulate it's Ron and Flip, and that's really what they did: worked to achieve their goal thoughtfully and collaboratively. Ron affiliates and interacts with two groups but doesn't blindly follow either of them. Flip explores his own identity to the point that it becomes an incessant part of his thoughts, but he still plays the part he has to. Obviously they're cops and we can't just go head-to-head with the KKK like they do, but their traits feel both relatable and attainable because, well, they were real humans and we are too. (Though, of course, even they weren't *fully* awake, as evidenced by Ron's conversation about Duke entering politics... but then again, unless you were one of the few people who predicted Trump's victory, neither were you right? I might've been woke but I wasn't that awake lol) 

Of course, all that being said... for those of us who are more aligned with the resistance and consider these sorts of topics regularly, it's definitely frustrating that there's few tangible options to consider. But hey, maybe this movie is part of a larger cultural shift of people being more conscious which'll help surface more real-world solutions. I'm keeping my faith high (or at least trying to)!",962sh1

e4eklgu,"Yea things haven't changed much, in fact there is a serious fucking resurgence of the brazen behavior of the KKK at the time. Cops are blatantly targeting people of color (or did you forget the Florida Chief who told his officers to pin unsolved crimes on black folks?). The fucking president of the United States uses the same rhetoric as David Dukes, fucking black people have the cops called on them for no fucking reason (8y/o selling water, using a valid coupon, utilizing the community pool, and even for staying in their own living room).
As for the profit aspect,sure, they made money, just because some makes money on something doesn't mean they're not right.
Right now, the sitting president of the United States endorses white supremacists,refuses to condemn neo Nazis, and trashes people of color on the daily. Donald J. Trump uses so much of their rhetoric,the KKK endorsed him during his presidential campaign (through former leader David  Duke, and pro KKK newspapers). Furthermore, his slogans used throughout his campaign (America First, and Make America Great Again) have been slogans used by the KKK, and Trump is all too happy to use them. This pathetic excuse for a human being has been elected to the highest office in the land, this was not I'm spite of his inflammatory rhetoric, but because of it. 
Lastly, we have the Fox News Propaganda machine using similar rhetoric when discussing legal immigration. This is mainstream now, yes, David Duke is a despicable human, and it's real easy to fall in the trap of laughing at the stupidity of the KKK arguments, but people embrace it. They may not be out as much anymore, but they never stopped working on making America white again. Right now they are rallying against Latinx, Blacks, and the LGBTQ community, soon they'll move to attack people who they think do not fit the Aryan model. 
That is why movies like this are important,because they show us what we have become. As humans,the only way we'll eradicate this hatred is by educating people,but guess what, this fucking administration is gutting the DOE budget, as well as civil rights offices in the department. They are back on track. And we need to do our part. If you see a Nazi, get in their face,show them they are not welcome here!",962sh1

That’s an incredibly brief runthrough of why people hate Gone with the Wind by the way. Look it up if you’re interested. There’s probably thousands of books and thousands of videos on the subject.

like, if it's propaganda, why is it making good points about both sides?

i'd argue it's nuance is what keeps it from being propaganda.  ''on the nose'' is only relevant if you only paid attention to half the movie.

and no, depicting one group as slightly more morally sound doesn't make them 'the good guys.'  it's a 6-4 split.  both groups had violent rhetoric, saying things like the only good _____ is a dead ______.  the difference was there was an extremist cell of four people in the kkk.  but there could have easily been an extremist group in the black power group.  this doesn' make it propaganda.  it serves as a warning to the black power movements not to radicalize into bringing violence to it's message.

there's a reason david duke was depicted as nonviolent, friendly, good natured and somewhat passive. the kkk wasn't a threat in that movie.  they like to burn crosses and talk about america being an ethnostate.  the message was:

When Stallworth and Zimmerman sit down to debrief the case with their boss, Zimmerman may not defend the KKK outright, but he definitely does some deflecting. Zimmerman also makes it clear to Stallworth that he is not down with the crusade and the investigation, for him, is not personal.

Also, during the scene you mention, Zimmerman distances himself from his Jewish heritage by telling Stallworth basically that he didn’t feel to that part of his identity (he wasn’t raised Jewish, he says that explicitly). He did say since working the case he had been “thinking about it a lot,” but I thought that seemed very neutral and vague.

A significant amount of people have asked the question of whether or not it was him in the end, which really speaks for itself.

Go into any comment thread with any black film, you'll see this exact comment. ""Get Out wasn't subtle enough. The Purge wasn't subtle enough. Detroit wasn't subtle enough. Moonlight wasn't subtle enough. 12 Years a Slave wasn't subtle enough."" So he makes this film with absolutely no intention of being subtle. Because regardless of any degree of subtlety, I have yet to see anyone justifiably make the case that something being overt and in-your-face is inherently bad. Maybe the time for ""being subtle"" is over. It clearly hasn't worked.",962sh1

That first scene to me, was showing the soldiers yes, but then showing the confederate flag.  These people died for their beliefs, as wrong as they are.  They stopped fighting with weapons, but their kids still heard their thoughts on the subject, their heros were allowed to survive and become legend.  Their flag still flew.

Trump is the face of America that has normalised racism.
He is the symptom of decades of creep of Nazi and KKK ideologies into the minds of normal people.

Recently you are seeing this in Germany, with the protests in Chemnitz, although it's very accelerated, it shows how quickly it can enter the minds of people in the centre. The protests went from Nazi/neo-Nazis and Nationalist marching (with Nazi flags), to them marching again and alongside them in a ""separate"" march are marching normal Germans who share concerned views on immigration, to them now holding a single march under the current national flags with PEGIDA.

It aligns people with their views and give them validity.

Those ""normal"" people who march with them will never say they are Nazis, but that they are concerned citizens, and will baulk at the association. However their lack of condemnation of the Nazis ideologies further normalises their views, allowing more and more of their views to spread. The ""normal"" people know Nazis are bad, but they ""agree"" on that 1 issue...and on that other issue too..and..blah blah

It's why there are people who say they saw people leave the cinema when they showed the Charlottesville clips, they didn't want to consider that they were hand in hand with Nazis.

In America is happend slowly and gradually, building up in a crescendo with the presidential campaign, but it's not only in America.

Reasons for this are broad and multifactorial. Everyone now has easy access to a platform, decades of accelerated division between the rich and poor, lack of investment in education leaves domestic workforce unable to work effectively resulting in increasing welfare, the recent housing market collapse, war mentality following decades of our troops in the Middle East, the reluctance to kill of the idea of colonial superiority, the teaching of only the good part of out history and the glorification of war and fucking austerity measures to name a few.",962sh1

It sounds like you didn't read my comment very well. My entire point was that to a black woman in the 70s in the south, the police *were and never have been her friend*. It was not 'one or two experiences', it was living a system where those people are literally designed and employed to keep you down. Cops literally were the frontline against black people protesting for their freedoms. Cops were the frontline for scaring black people into not speaking up. You think that time she got pulled over in the movie was literally the first time a cop had ever done something wrong to her? That kind of shit was *completely regular*, it happened *all the time* whenever the cops felt like it and there was nothing absolutely any of them could do to get justice. At this period, in the place, cops were literally not there to protect black people. You'll notice even that the male main character doesn't disagree with her on this - he says that he's doing it to try to improve it from within. This was literally just a fact of life for black people. Again, you're seeing this from a very white and very modern day perspective, which is super understandable. You've lived a life where cops have been respectable and treated you well. That's not what these people had to go through.",962sh1

Hitler was a vegetarian and animal rights supporter who was anti-smoking. He was also a socialist who supported free education, free healthcare etc. His NSDAP plan included the following:

>""Abolition of unearned (work and labour) incomes. Breaking of rent-slavery."" 

and 

>""We demand a land reform suitable to our needs, provision of a law for the free expropriation of land for the purposes of public utility, the abolition of taxes on land and prevention of all speculation in land""

and

>The state is to be responsible for a fundamental reconstruction of our whole national education program, to enable every capable and industrious German to obtain higher education and subsequently introduction into leading positions. The plans of instruction of all educational institutions are to conform with the experiences of practical life. The comprehension of the concept of the State must be striven for by the school [Staatsbuergerkunde] as early as the beginning of understanding. We demand the education at the expense of the State of outstanding intellectually gifted children of poor parents without consideration of position or profession.

Trump calling coyotes who rape 80% of the women they traffick into the US ""rapists"" isn't racist. Increasing the amount of indian immigrants isn't racist. Wanting border security that is half as good as mexico isn't racist.

I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a “more convenient season.” Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.""

And there's still countless videos today of people brutality and racism, sometimes even committed by black cops, who have been indoctrinated into the same system of violence and power tripping.

So because a few black people are millionaires in this country that makes it okay for black kids to be slaughtered in the streets for nothing? How many black millionaires are there compared to white millionaires in America? I will guarantee you the divide is closer to 80/20 than 50/50.

Black people, Mexican people, LGBT people, Muslim people are not treated with nearly the same respect as white people. Like, it's not even close. And by repeating and supporting the current racist Administrations tactics and wordage, it's allowing white people to be more brazenly racist than ever. 

Every time someone acts like racism is dead in America, all it does is show that they either have their heads in the sand, or don't believe a 15 year old getting shot in the head by a racist cop is somehow not racist.

And if you're one of those people that think black kids getting murdered isn't racist then you would probably be a racist too.

You don't see the huge racial divide in Europe or Canada as much because at least their leadership does not tolerate hate spech. In Germany, it is illegal to be a Nazi, as they should be. 

But believe me, it will be many many years until America adopts those tactics other countries use to fight racists, because white people hold the power in this country and until white politicians realize that alot of their ""policies"" are racist (such as supporting private federal prisons), America will continue to be a country divided by good or evil.

In the end I do believe the present day footage was important and valuable as the purpose was to portray that hate and violence still exist in the US, connecting back to what was shown in the movie (even though over 50 years have passed). The overall ignorance/ apathy to modern day racism is an important issue that relates to all Americans, not just those affected by racism directly.

That would be a far cry from loading a gun because you're scared of a car tailing you in the middle of the night which is more or less innocuous.  
  
The gun isn't mentioned or shown again because the situation is diffused. The gun signifies the *possibility* that something might happen and the payoff is that it doesn't happen. Flip even addresses this with Ron later when he chastises him for tailing too close. The gun was not forgotten (the root of Chekhov's point), it merely served its purpose. There's dozens of guns in this movie. Chekov's example gun is the *only* gun which makes it unique and therefore important.  
  
Unimportant objects don't need to serve a larger purpose just because they were introduced. There's nothing inherently important about a gun in rural 70s America.

How can you not profile people if you intend to enforce the law? Trump overturned their abusive power just like he did with Dinesh D'Souza. Just look at what the Liberal media did to Roy Moore.

Civil Rights for minorities and programs, raising the budget from 75 million to 600 million. 

Nixon allocated 12 million dollars for Sickle Cell research. This disease afflicts one out of every 500 black children.

In that same year of 1971, he required affirmative action for federal contractors and actually set the bar for Government Programs for years. 

And finally, this is one that you really need to pay attention to because even now, it matters: In 1957, President Eisenhower proposed laws that would act as enforcements for the 15th amendment giving southern blacks the right to vote and in this Bill, southerners demanded that people who defied the new laws would be put on trial before a jury of their peers. But the jury at this time was all white, and this new bill did not mention anything about Blacks sitting on trial thanks to dilution by Democratic and some republican politicians.

On the other hand, there is nothing a person targeted by Nazis can do to win the favor of Nazis, they are being targeted for existential reasons.

e43qk6o,"I would say that this film was more social commentary rather than pure entertainment so I felt the ending related and belonged as it showed similar themes. It wasn't just ""like having a PSA for littering at the end of free willy"" as it showed that there is still a great amount of hate and racism that causes people to be hurt and even killed in the same way as was shown in the movie. At its core this movie was very politically charged and shouldn't be critiqued and viewed as if it was a normal movie.

Furthermore, I disagree with you stating that it was ""stupidest decision of the entire movie"" because ""everyone knows the KKK is bad and we dont need a movie to ridicule them."" If that was the case this would be a criticism of the movie itself, instead of the montage at the end which wasn't an artistic criticism but a collection of real life videos. 

The graphic footage is meant to shock and bring a serious tone compared to the overall lightheartedness of the end of the movie. In addition to showing clips to those who were unaware, I also saw present day footage as a call to action. Even though you've ""already seen most of the videos shown,"" what have you done as a response to atrocities being committed? Have you changed any aspects of your life? Or do you continue living as you have before?

This also ties back to the movie and the overall message of Patrice of how racism can't be stopped without action.",962sh1
e44jr2v,It does belong in the film as it contextualizes the events and serves as a narrative thread. It takes the surrealism of the film and places its squarely on our laps reminding us that we are still dealing with some of the same issues.

e43mrjj,"The way Rotten Tomatoes works is that it only measures if a review was positive (over a 5/10) or if a review was negative (under a 5/10). It doesn't count the exact rating that somebody gave the movie. 

So Pulp Fiction could have a lot more 10/10 ratings than BlacKKKlansman, but it also might be a bit more polarizing and has more 4/10 ratings than BlacKKKlansman. So 94% of Pulp Fiction's ratings are positive, and 97% of BlacKKKlansman's are positive reviews.

You do make an interesting point that he could have been falsely accused instead. I like that Spike Lee included how these hate groups affect multiple groups, rather than making it White/Black (like I said), but I can see the merit in the other route as well.

However, the experience you suggest, that American Jews would know about the Holocaust by the 1950s, I don't think is realistic. In fact, my Jewish father was not taught much about the Holocaust because it was a point of shame for a long time for Jews; prior to that, Jews were ""God's Chosen"", a point made in the movie. After the Holocaust, many Jews felt abandoned by god and others distanced themselves because despite Jews being allowed in the United States, they were certainly not welcome.

So to me, the point that Driver grows up without his family placing much emphasis on being Jewish was very real of people in that era. These days, Jews learn about the Holocaust regularly and are taught the ""Never Again"", but it hasn't always been that way.",962sh1

1. The film being a social commentary
If that was the directors intention from the first place thats fine but I just dont think it fits for the story told. Thats just my personal opinion, I think it should have been kept as a period piece. As far as  ""shouldn't be critiqued and viewed as if it was a normal movie"" I couldnt disagree more. Any political message or commentary does not change the fact that this was a movie, a block buster no less shown all over the country. You can judge it as a social commentary, which is fine, but its a movie first and foremost and thats how I will judge it. And as a movie it was very flawed.

2.
The ""stupidest decision"" and ""everyone knows the kkk is bad"" are talking about too different things. So yes the ""stupidest decision"" is a critique on the end montage rather than the movie. The question is, do you include that as part of the movie or not?

3.
A call to action for what? The movie talks about how racism needs to be fought but it doesn't seem to have a solution. It even seems to question what is the best method for it? The main character questions the ideas of the guest speaker in the beginning of the movie. He even questions ""am I really fighting for my race or is this just a part of the job"". I'm not sure if its a call to action, rather maybe just the spark to start a conversation, or at least more conversation, and to enlighten more people that re blind to what is happening in this country.",962sh1

You do make good points though, I think I still embrace Spike Lee's choice because it mirrors our modern racism better when more than just African Americans are the focus, but I can see why that would be a point of contention. I would be interested to hear from any older Jews from that area and time period, all the Jews I know are from the coasts, not the South.
