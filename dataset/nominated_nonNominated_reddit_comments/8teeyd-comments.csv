e16v35t,"I thought it was fantastic! I was tearing up constantly, particularly when he invited Officer Clemens, to wash his feet with him, then they showed the context of the chemicals being thrown in pools. The juxtaposition of that video with Mr Rogers’ pure kindness and care brought me to tears.

I also loved the ending, beautifully crafted by the director so that the audience realizes what’s happening as the people close to Mr Rogers reflect during that minute, and us in the audience reflect ourselves.

Nobody in my theater stood up immediately. I think it’s because nobody wanted to leave the comfort of Mr Rogers’ neighborhood and go back into the divided world we live in now. But I think this documentary came at a perfect time, because we could all learn a little from Mr Rogers right now.",8teeyd
e16vcfv,"I found this pretty challenging honestly. I went in expecting it to be a retrospective and nostalgic look at how we need Mr. Rogers in today's divided culture, but the end it asks ""What are you going to do to carry on what he did?""

I found that really powerful. Mr. Rogers kept coming back to television later in his life due to a personal responsibility he felt. We shouldn't need Mr. Rogers to come back because we saw him teaching it all to us. So that we can be the change. 

Just something that really hung with me.",8teeyd

Especially since they made such a point of showing that Mr. Rogers showed himself in Daniel -- he himself truly had trouble comprehending why someone would assassinate.

- Mom left dry-eyed, but enjoyed the movie. She was confused at why I wanted to see this, having not really paid much attention to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood when I was a kid. I told her the best way I could explain it was that my generation tends to look for tangible moral heroes, especially now, and Fred Rogers is a famous example of someone we want to see more of.

- I didn't cry as much as I thought I would (the trailer made me tear up, so I was prepping to be a sobbing mess), but it did happen. Clemmons' story of his loneliness when coming out, Fred Rogers telling him to keep his homosexuality a secret, and then stating ""I love you"" for two years to him broke me. Did anyone else feel like they glossed over that just a tad? Did Rogers ever state his specific feelings on homosexuality?

- It astounded me that Rogers was still unsure if he was a good person at the end. 

- The main thing that made Fred Rogers the most relatable is how unsure he was about himself. He had done all this good, and felt he hadn't done enough. 

- I got a twinge of anger at the protest at his funeral and the jabs at his effeminacy. Like, just . . . why? It's also good for this movie to come out to show a registered Republican who was a Christian who saw the good in people. God, why can't we have that anymore?

Between talking about Vietnam the first week on the air, Mr. Rogers and Officer Clemons in the pool, and Daniel Tiger asking about the word assassination, it was crazy to see how much was mature subjects were covered.

e16xsoc,"Two observations:

I've been in many films where the audience spontaneously applauded at the end but I've been in very few where they spontaneously applauded at some point in the middle of the film, but when they showed the clip of Mr. Rogers convincing Senator Pastore to continue funding for PBS the audience broke out into applause.

I was previously familiar with the significance of Mr. Rogers sharing a pool with Officer Clemmons on the show but it was only when watching the clip and watching Mr. Rogers wash Clemmons' feet that I remembered that washing the feet of the apostles is one of the acts Jesus performs in the gospels.  I don't know if that's what Mr. Rogers was thinking of when he did that but it made me realize just how much he lived in imitation of Christ.",8teeyd

e1cuq2t,"I love how people in my theater snapped in time with Mr. Rogers while he was singing ""It's such a Good Feeling"". That was heart warming to hear. 

Maybe it's the nostalgia, maybe it's the current political climate we're living in, or maybe it's because I've had a really rough couple of months (mentally and emotionally) but man, was I overwhelmed with emotions. 

Earlier in the year, I had a hard time convincing myself that I wasn't a failure. I would go into intense crying fits before going to sleep, repeating things like ""I can't do it, I can't do it"", and I was making life much more difficult than it had to be. So seeing these archived clips of Mr. Rogers' wisdom and songs just hit me right in the heart. 

I have a great supportive family and friends, but it was something else hearing this good man lend his encouragement and love. Selfishly, I really needed this and I'm so happy Morgan Neville made this film. I haven't had a movie experience like this in a long time. ",8teeyd

I loved it. I'm head over heels for this film. I was excited to see it even though I did not grow up on the show, but he is such a powerful voice in the world. I felt inspired to love and spread positivty. I just left feeling wholesome and emotionally destroyed.

I wonder what Mister Rogers would feel in this insane world we live in now.

This is such a beautiful beautiful movie and I cried multiple times. I want things to be better, I want people to be kind, I want people to care, I want people to love, I wish mister Rogers was still here so he could guide us, but we’ll have to pay attention to the things he did and follow in his footsteps.

e1a3o79,"“Won’t You Be My Neighbor” may not be the greatest documentary ever made technically, but it may be one of the most important stories not only politically, not only religiously, but for cinema and what it is today. 


Fred Rogers respected children. He didn’t think of them as “almost people,” he thought of them as actual human beings who contribute to the world now. 


Rogers is a pivotal piece of why children’s film can have mature themes. I don’t think “The Incredibles,” “Zootopia,” or even “Gravity Falls” could exist today without Rogers, which may sound weird to say. These pieces of entertainment appeal to kids not despite of, but because of their dynamics. 


Kids are such an important piece of society, and if we insult their intelligence and pretend that they’re barely even humans yet than we are doing something incredibly wrong. “Won’t You Be My Neighbor” hammers this point home in the most beautiful way possible.",8teeyd
e1cazzz," ★★★★


I wonder what the world be like now if Mr. Rogers was still around?

If there was ever only a select amount of people in life that could live forever, I think I would have nominated Fred to be one of them. He had the ability to interpret the real world in a way that was understandable to children, and nowadays I feel like that's needed more than ever.

I don't always agree with Mr. Rogers viewpoints, in a lot of ways he's very conservative, a bit of a prude really. Super christian. He's also a very strange man, but it's part of his charm. There really was no one else like him.

For the movie itself it's a pretty standard documentary film about a public figure. Old footage, testimonials from the people that knew him. The stuff you typically find in documentary films. What makes it stand out a bit more is that it has some great music and some really nice original animation. We learn a lot about Fred from the other side of the camera, how he was as a person, his beliefs, his values. It's engaging, but at times it can feel a little slow. I wish we could have heard a little more from his kids how he was as a parent. That I found really interesting, he was a father to many, but how was he a father to his actual kids? 

Regardless, you're going to tear up when you watch it, it's just going to happen.

I think a lot of people aren't really rating the movie for the movie, but they're rating the man, and his story. Fred Rogers deserves all the stars in the world. That man was a saint. I'm thankful this movie exists because it brings Mr. Rogers back in a world that needs him a lot. Especially with some of the negativity the internet can bring with people being so unkind to eachother and our sense of real community dwindling.

We desperately needed some Mr. Rogers. A good watch. Thank you Fred.",8teeyd
e1str61,"The senate scene was incredible. The ending when he talked about taking a moment to think about someone who has helped and that no matter what there will always be someone that has helped you or will. I lost it. This was a powerful movie. I did not really remember the Mr. Rogers show as a child, but seeing what he did for children was moving. He genuinely cared and it’s a really beautiful thing. ",8teeyd
e2wggyn,"I remember hearing rumors about Fred Rogers being a veteran sniper with tattoos and believing it was true. So, when they covered that in the doc, and mentioned it was because no one could possibly believe that one person could be so good, that really stood out to me. These days it feels like every famous person is being outed as a monster, and he was so nice that people tried as hard as they could to find something wrong with him. 

It's also amazing to see him handle difficult current events and find ways for kids to understand it. I can't think of any other children's show that has talked about assassinations or death like that. For a show that is considered so wholesome and inoffensive, he took a lot of risks tackling subjects that could really cause a huge uproar if they weren't handled with such care. ",8teeyd
e1aq8ci,"It made me sad when he apparently said ""I just don't see how this will help"" or something similar during the 9/11 episodes. During the whole documentary he seemed pretty assured of the importance of his show, do you think that started to change towards the end of his life or was it maybe just the unique despair 9/11 brought? ",8teeyd
e1hyevd,"Watched this about a day ago and while it definitely impacted me, it has had me thinking about a couple of things specifically. First of all, when the child psychologist was talking tor. Rogers about how children will form a bond with him, even though they are only seeing him on television, it was such an eye opener to me. For one, as I watched, I realized that it was true. I watched the show growing up and it reminded me how I felt about Mr. Rogers, like I knew him, like he was a part of my life, much like a loved teacher or caretaker. But also how, that had to have been such a burden sometimes, and he never shied away from that. Imagine, if everywhere you went, you had children and grown ups, coming up to you, acting as if they knew you, like, they felt they were close to you, and wanted to hug you and touch you. And yet, he realized this and not only did he not ever allow this to hinder him, but he embraced it. Somehow, he never lost that childlike wonder and charm and that's incredible really.

The second thing I have thought about is, how mad he got when heard about kids emulating Superman and getting injured. It made me think about how there is a real disconnect with the heros we fantasize about, and the one's we have in real life. I read comic books my whole life, and we have been inundated with superheroes for some time now, but when I think about my childhood heroes from real life, they are a far cry from those in fiction. I feel like people like Mr. Rogers, Steve Irwin, Captain Kangaroo, Jim Henson, and others that helped shape us through education and entertainment as children, they are shortchanged. They showed us the value of friendship, love, beauty, self-acceptance, tolerance, imagination, and low-key developing a sense of morals not attached to a religious or political code. They should be applauded and esteemed for this! ",8teeyd
e262s2q,I teared multiple times but the scene between him and Koko the gorillia...I was done. ,8teeyd
e17gx24," I was born around the time when his life was drawing close to an end. That said, “Mr. Rogers Neighborhood” was on reruns for years and years until I eventually turned, I think, 10. I never had cable so the majority of my childhood viewing involved nothing but PBS Kids shows such as “Mr. Rogers”. One of the biggest heartbreaks of my childhood wasn’t Fred Rogers’ death, but of how I learned that he passed. There was this PBS Kids kids’ day somewhere in New York around 2004. I think it was South Street Seaport, but I could be wrong. My mom took my sister and I to it where they celebrated several shows from “Clifford” to “Cyberchase” to “Big Comfy Couch” and “Mister Rogers Neighborhood”. When the “Mister Rogers” part came around, they brought out  Mr. McFeely. When I asked my mom, “Hey, where’s Mr. Rogers,” she just bluntly said, “Oh, he’s dead.”

Tell that shit to a six-year-old and he’ll lose his mind. Of course, I lost my shit.

Just going to throw this out there: This movie is my closure. “Won’t You Be My Neighbor” is my personal closure to the truth bomb my mom told me at the wrong place at the wrong time.

One may exaggerate by saying that if you don’t like, “Won’t You Be My Neighbor” or Fred Rogers himself, you’re most likely an asshole. That said, if this man or this movie doesn’t put a smile on your face, you are most likely a heartless bastard and you need to get yourself checked.

For someone who didn't have academic experience with children, he had the gift for connecting with them.

e21em3d,"I saw this movie last night, and the theater was 100% capacity. 

Lots of tears. People loved this man. He was sincere. He was a lone man from Pittsburgh trying in his way to change the world.

The film was a great documentary, and edited well, with video clips interspliced for context and for color commentary from others in his life. 

So I learned something: his show was an act of defiance. Defiance against the way he had been raised, and the way that TV was presented to children at that time.  Maybe defiance against society as a whole.

What was his motivation for being Mr. Rogers? How did he come to that? What was he thinking?

His show was an act of making sure children were treated with respect, love, and dignity -- things he lacked in his own childhood, apparently. (That's a story there that the film didn't go into in depth, and maybe the Tom Hanks biopic will show us what that was all about.)


The film certainly valorized him. That's tricky because the audience wants so badly to only think he's saintly. Not human.

But another side was presented too. A certain. . . showmanship. An evangelizing quality, a man on a mission. 

Like King Friday the 13th, he was a ""benevolent despot."" (He said, I think, that the character most resembling himself was King Friday, although others said it was Daniel the Tiger.) 

 

He said that the most evil are those who make another feel ""less than."" Why? Maybe the biopic will answer that.

Good film, see it.

I saw it yesterday with my wife and it was incredibly touching. I found myself feeling like a small child again. It broke me down into tears a few times.

I'm so happy Morgan took the time to recount on his life because he was one-of-a-kind, really I don't think we'll have a figure like him ever again. I remember other kids were suspicious of how good he was growing up, heck even to this day the thought lingers.

I thought that the documentary did a nice job of showing how the man was able to (mostly) strike a balance between his conservative and progressive ideals. I suspect that Fred Rogers was an ally of the gay community, but he just wasn't ready to have an openly gay cast member on his simple kids' show at the time. Does anyone know if he ever addressed the ""two mommies"" or ""two daddies"" subject on his later programs? (I didn't continue to watch into adulthood, but I now regret having not done so.)

e1x0c4v,"I'm a little surprised by the all the uncritical love. I'm starting to think it says more about our current times, and our desperation for an “insider,” a person of privilege, to be a decent human being, than anything. I realize that many of Rogers' accomplishments are admirable, but as always, it’s never all or nothing. It’s telling that Betty Aberlin has been largely quiet with all the current hubbub. She has always maintained a respectful silence, but from what I’ve gathered, her feelings for the show are conflicted, if not outright negative (I don’t know Aberlin personally, this is simply based on a few off the cuff comments I’ve read). It sounds like Rogers was very much a “benevolent dictator” of sorts and shut down several attempts by cast members to use their Mr. Rogers clout to start grassroots programs, ones that would have reached out to under-privileged kids, and kids of color. I don’t think Rogers had any kind of overt nefarious intentions or anything, he simply didn’t want any efforts made that were not under his personal, direct control. I hope that someone who knows Aberlin can convince her to tell her side of the story. Again, I don’t believe there are any smoking guns here, or anything, but it has always seemed to me that Rogers’ real power lay in the fact he could sneak into those households that were mainly white, Christian, conservative, and affluent without getting shut-off, and deliver a half-way positive message. And yes, I’m glad that someone could do that, because there weren’t many then and there aren’t many now. But it really was “Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood,” not “Officer Clemmons, Lady Aberlin and Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood.” He never really shared it with them, did he? Not unless they behaved themselves and did exactly what he told them to do. He advised Clemmons who was gay (and Rogers knew it) to get married to a woman, for Pete’s sake.

Why not look back at some episodes or even a couple clips? Listen and see how you could apply some of his small lessons in your daily life.

His titular mantra was that we are ALL special in our own ways. We all have the capacity to do what Mr. Rogers did, and can be just as incredibly nice/good in our own lives as he was in his practice.

My Mom (who was born and raised in Philadelphia) actually had a couple of friends who worked with Fred Rogers at WQED in Pittsburgh in the early days of his programming. She told me that they were devasted when he died as so many saw him as a Father-figure. 

She also used to watch it with my older brother when he was very young back in the 80's (he's 7 years older than me), and then later with me and my sister when we were kids back in the 90's. 

So we all had a connection to Mr. Rogers in some form or another. For me personally, I bawled like a baby off and on during the film. I said it in another post, but I've been going through a lot both mentally and emotionally... so being comforted and advised by Mr. Rogers again was exactly what I needed. 

My sister didn't cry, but she came close when she heard the ""Mistake"" song sung by Daniel Striped Tiger and Lady Aberline. My sister has never been diagnosed with depression, but she believes she's battled with depression in the past (and now)... so for her, that song hit very close to home. 

We had close to 20+ people in our tiny theatre. Off and on you could hear people crying and laughing. It added to the experience. It's been a long time since I've heard a group of people go through that range of emotion in just 90 minutes.

e1zu9se,"According to Morgan Neville, he tried his best to include Betty Aberlin. He said the two would have lengthy phone conversations and Ms. Aberlin often times went ""back and forth"" on the idea of being interviewed. Neville said her being hesitant stemmed from being nervous-- apparently it has been a while since Ms. Aberlin has been infront of a camera, let alone another film director. Ultimately, she declined. Morgan wanted so badly to include her, but he respected her wishes.

I don't know where you're getting the whole ""sneaking into households of white, Christian, conservatives"" as there are numerous (hundreds, even) anecdotes from people of all walks of life explaining how important the show was to their childhood. To a lot of kids, Mr. Rogers was most likely the first trust-worthy adult in their lives. You don't get almost a 1 million letters of fan mail by only talking to one demographic. Whoever watched him was a welcomed visitor.

As for the Francois Clemmons relationship, Francois has publicly said that Mr. Rogers regretted his initial advice. Here's a better interview from Francois that explains their friendship: [https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/mister-rogers-neighborhood-wont-you-be-my-neighbor-francois-clemmons-officer-clemmons-fred-rogers](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/mister-rogers-neighborhood-wont-you-be-my-neighbor-francois-clemmons-officer-clemmons-fred-rogers)

As far as the gay issue is concerned with not having Francois ""come out"" on TV, Mr. Rogers believed that would have been the death of his show. He was already pushing a line with an African-American police officer... Families that discriminated against gay people would have stopped watching the show in droves. And whatever funding the show got from sponsors would have disappeared too. So privately, Mr. Rogers came to support Francois in time. His willingness to change and accept is commendable. Most people are too stubborn to even ""try"" to change.

I mean, you're right in saying that Mr. Rogers was in fact a person. And like everyone else, he had his own faults and shortcomings that he spent a lifetime figuring out. The documentary shows a few of his obsessive habits and also his insecurities-- things like ""Am I good enough?"", ""Can I do this?"", and ""Did my life matter in the end?"".  It's quite powerful when you see them. And because there is more of a ""human"" element on display here, audiences have had an intense emotional reaction to it. That's why people are giving it such high praise.",8teeyd
e1xerhx,"In the documentary, they do, in ways, address the mission-driven ""my way"" side of Fred Rogers. They compare him to Daniel Tiger as Mr. Roger's ""true self"", but that he had another side that was very much like ""King Friday"".

They did not have Betty Aberlin interviewed, nor Chuck Aber. The documentary was very much focused on Fred as a person, not necessarily the show, but it those two were definitely missing.

When Twitch did the 24/7 steam of 99% of Mr. Rogers Neighborhood, Better Aberlin would come in during the live chat. It was very interesting to chat with her in real lime. (Though, honestly, I just read along). My impression was that Fred was very complicated and that as the years went on Betty had a complicated relationship with him and the show. It reminded me of people who had complicated relationships with their father. Fred may have been insecure of his creation/platform and was protective of it. There were things they wanted (the neighborhood players) to perhaps expirment with and develop (keep doing more operas, release more original music, do outside projects) but those didn't really get the approval. Betty also says that Chuck Aber was supposed to *take over* the show. There was a succession plan. But then it didn't happen. Maybe it's better that didn't happen. But she talks about it as something that was going to happen and didn't. And then there's Daniel Tiger and she feels that, maybe, why this cartoon show and not the other kinds of projects they could have done? There's an unwritten history of this show.

This might be a stretch but I remembered reading her comments and I kept thinking of Ron Reagan's book about his father (My Father at 100) and the complicated way that he wrote about him. There's an extreme fondness and love but also... a puzzlement. There was a distance. The way she'd talk about it reminded me of that - a father who was close but also a mystery, and trying to come to terms with all of the contradictions. 

I think she would have a fascinating book.

e284mxy,"If you're into television history, child development psychology, or philosophy of human dignity, definitely see it. The film is hagiographic and long despite running only 94 minutes; and, it's messy not really having a clear thesis. But, you can re-edit the film in your mind. I saw it with Moviepass! For me, I was fascinated by Fred Rogers's commitment to having a direct relationship as a TV host with children through the TV set, to teach them human dignity via dignified experience and acknowledgement of their feelings. I loved his metaphor about perfect major piano intervals vs jumping the more difficult piano intervals are like getting through perfect versus difficult intervals in growing up and how we need more help and care with the tougher ones. I also loved how he wrestled with whether this idea was too complicated to be teachable. I never knew that Pee Wee's Playhouse in the 80's and Blue Clues in the 2000's were total ripoffs of his show (the movie does not say this—I am saying this after watching this movie). And it's fascinating that he was like a real life Tim Burton-created character in the vein of being a rich kid bullied over being fat who became a real life Willy Wonka archetype. The wishes of others on this thread that they wanted more detailed info from Aberlin or more counter-examples of his controlling inclinations aren't necessary to see how he was protective of his vision. Clearly, he wanted to be as decent as possible with his approach to making the show and its brand, but was not naive about making commercial sponsors and government happy to support his message to children through their TV sets. I loved how he had really strong feelings about ""pie in the face"" cartoon humor having the effect of precluding neighborliness and dignity. Maybe the most inspiring thing about the film is that it shows how one person had a vision and realized it for the betterment of everyone else using a new medium in a new way (TV). Iconoclasts, like Rogers, that create the original mold of an archetype e.g. the archetype of that misunderstood, formerly fat and bullied, dorky, square, manchild that seems a little toooo good with children and not as good with adults, who became somewhat hollowed out despite their starkly explicit exterior will never be completely understood; but, the film gets across what Fred Rogers thought was important that we understand about him. And, it seems reasonable. One questions the film raises, but which I was disappointed they didn't try to answer is whether Fred Rogers's ""everyone is unique and special"" had a positive or negative impact in the long term. It seems that this thread of fans shows that he, at least, has a lot of followers that believe in his message. But that's also the message that everyone complains about when complaining about millennials.",8teeyd
e2qlzf8,"I am old enough to have been a fan of his but he never resonated with me so I have no childhood emotional connection to him. But as a fan of pop culture and being interested in history, I wanted to see this film. There's no way I would have gone to the theater to see it without Movie Pass, though. I would have waited until it came to Neflix or Prime Video. 

Having said that, I did enjoy it. Outside of IMAX movies, I think it's the first documentary I've ever seen in a theater. We just don't get them at my local theaters very often. ",8teeyd
e16ww9l,"Not only do I miss Mr Rogers, but I also really miss Bob Ross and Steve Irwin. Bob Ross was the Mr Rogers of painting while Steve Irwin was the Mr Rogers to animals since he really admired animals (Especially dangerous ones).",8teeyd
e1e3p7o,"To me, this documentary was not an exposé. It never set itself out to be. 

The opening scene gives you an idea what this movie is trying to accomplish. Mr. Rogers thinks about musical modulation as a type of journey. Some roads will be easier to travel and some roads will challenge and reward you along the way. It might be scary, but you don't need to take the plunge all at once. It's the little steps that add up over time. 

So by that scene alone, we're introduced to the ideologies of Mr. Rogers-- not his actual ""life story"". The documentary focuses on a series of actions that he took along the way to teach compassion and love. There was a deliberate method to his approach and, like music, his method spoke to people of all walks of life. 

The movie was more about: here's this one man's use of kindness. From there, let's show how it affected the lives it touched. Kindness can be extraordinary when you commit yourself wholly to it. 

To me, that is very revealing especially when so many people will write kindness off as ""weak"". When so many people questioned the role kindness can play, Mr. Rogers showed that all people are deserving of it and all people are capable of realizing it.

e172lxp,"I got the sense it was because Mr Rogers knew the show would lose sponsors, quite possibly resulting in the cancellation of the show.  So, with the choice of continuing to teach the children or to stand up for a cast member through scandal, he would choose the children. ",8teeyd
e18ixq8,If mr rogers lost his sponsors he would lose his show. It's not just about his views. ,8teeyd
e183v5h,"Lol, thank you for putting “Christians” in quotes. Though I have left Christianity, I know that those “God Hates Fags” folks are not representative at all of Christians. Most of the ones I interacted with in my time in Christianity were pleasant and friendly like Mr. Rogers. I was very fortunate. ",8teeyd
e181uq3,"That's fair, I'm sure that a lot of his life is available in some other form. Not sure why people downvoted you.",8teeyd
e1xoi52,The new Little Prince or the old one?,8teeyd
e1bl84s,That award was 20+ years later - it's possible that he became a much better person after that incident.  I hope so anyway.  ,8teeyd
e1dtez8,"Yeah... Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood is one of the few shows we let our daughter watch unsupervised if we need to do a chore in another room, take a shower, get ready for work, etc. It's got a great story progression, catchy songs that teach a valuable lesson (songs that I hear her repeat, so I know she's actually learned something), and it also teaches kids how to handle their emotions, which is something I know Mr. Rogers would appreciate.",8teeyd
e1tp4t1,I was wondering why she wasn't interviewed despite being so heavily featured in archival footage; I assumed she had passed away. I'm really curious why she refused; where did you read that?,8teeyd
e1919h8,"Interesting. It seems the director spoke to her many times, but she'd been out of the limelight so long that she didn't want to come out on camera. Wish we could have gotten interviews with her",8teeyd
e33tzxo,Is this genuine or no? Just wanna know.,8teeyd
e18d8fb,"When they had his daughter speak is when it really hit me that he was gone and my heart broke. He was such a wonderful and brave person who always seemed invincible. It’s such a tragedy he died so young. I really wish his kids could have had more time with him, especially seeing how much influence he still has in their lives today. ",8teeyd
e1c5cg5,"Ohh I thought your comment was saying you dislike them, my bad",8teeyd
e18zg9m,[deleted],8teeyd
e16xk2v,Blue county in a blue state. Don't know what that has to do with anything though.,8teeyd
e18es54,Are you being the kind of person Mr. Rogers wanted you to be?,8teeyd
e2rdbyp,">They did not have Betty Aberlin interviewed, nor Chuck Aber.

>Fred may have been insecure of his creation/platform and was protective of it. There were things they wanted (the neighborhood players) to perhaps expirment with and develop (keep doing more operas, release more original music, do outside projects) but those didn't really get the approval. Betty also says that Chuck Aber was supposed to *take over* the show. There was a succession plan. But then it didn't happen. Maybe it's better that didn't happen. But she talks about it as something that was going to happen and didn't. And then there's Daniel Tiger and she feels that, maybe, why this cartoon show and not the other kinds of projects they could have done? 

She can be frustrated about her ideas not being taken. But that's no reason for her to dislike him. He had a name to protect. It was perfectly OK for him to say no to things he didn't want to do. And it was OK for him to not want to pass his show on to another person who may not do it exactly the same way he did.

e1vki4o,Amazon prime has almost all the episodes on demand! It’s amazing.,8teeyd
e17k3hi,"They literally say just that in the documentary, the other guy mustve completely missed it",8teeyd
e23x120,I really missed not seeing Betty Aberlin in the movie. After Fred Rogers she had the most appearances on the show. She is Fortunately active on Twitter but it would have been nice to see her in the movie. ,8teeyd
e33w5tc,Yes. He's a dead ringer based on the old footage of Mr Rodgers they showed. ,8teeyd
e18hb4u,"I remember a year or two after his death. His daughter Bindi briefly had a show called ""Bindi The Jungle Girl"" where she taught about various animals. I think that also aired on Animal Planet or Discovery Kids.",8teeyd
e1b3ci3,"I guess this is just...


Not the right sub for you.",8teeyd
e16xttf,"Why so defensive?  You voted for him, too, didn’t you?!!!!!!!!!",8teeyd
e18ethb,"Ummmm.

No. :(",8teeyd
e2snz0g,"There's no indication she disliked him.
",8teeyd
e2qmao2,Do you know of any place has his adult show streaming? I was never into the kids show but I'm curious about the adult one now.,8teeyd
e58vam9,I know this is really late but I just watched the movie and Betty Aberlin is heavily featured in it. Am I missing something? ,8teeyd
e16xyf1,Defensive? Just pointing out where you are wrong in your inane assumptions. I didn't vote for anyone. Just want to see this film.,8teeyd
e5k9rzt,Yes but she didn’t give any interviews in the movie.  There were just clips from show. I’m sure she would have had a lot to say reflecting on the show and Fred. ,8teeyd
e17h0je,"The other thing that makes this person's comments absurd is that the movie mentions that **Mr. Rogers was a Republican himself**. If he was here today, I expect that he would be very saddened by how angry and hateful people on both sides of politics have been lately. ",8teeyd
e18et6v,It's probably a troll.,8teeyd
e18pwug,"But Fox News said that he ruined a generation, and Nixon wanted to cut pbs funding",8teeyd
