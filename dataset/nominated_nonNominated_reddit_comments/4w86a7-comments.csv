d64zyw5,"I was absolutely not sold on the Rick Flag/ Enchantress romance. I also couldn't buy El Diablo claiming the squad to be his family.

Performances were good, however, its the writing and plot that are troublesome. 

Editing did also seem strange. An example is one scene, I assume was meant for a minor laugh, where Deadshot opens a cracked glass door only to have it shatter as he does so. Only in the movie, it seems to cut right before the shattering even happens and the scene continues on. This highlights an almost impatient pace the movie has, lending credence to the rumors that the film underwent additional editing by the studio.",4w86a7

d67z0ux,"I watched it in IMAX 3D.  I did NOT feel it was a good movie, or even average movie. I knew very little about the characters before the movie and very little after the movie was over, save their names.  When the movie started, I was blown away by the visuals.  Absolutely the best part of the movie.

But during their introduction to the characters, I felt it was too exposition heavy and still did not really understand what their powers were.  Does harley quinn have super human powers?  Is she a skilled hand-to-hand fighter?  Why is she important to the group.  Why did they put killer croc in a sewer?  I don't understand.  When did villains get to make requests about what kind of cell they're put in.

It went from cool to starting to feel a late 90s vibe of comic book movies like ""Batman Forever"" .

None of the relationships felt earned.  I did not care about flagg or june moon.  The second she went rogue Waller should have just set her heart on fire and killed her.  I do not understand why the heart thing worked, but then it didn't work, but then it worked again.  He could have killed her in the beginning, which apparently has no affect on Moon at all. Like What? LOL  Why didn't the enchantress release her brother at the beginning after she possessed Moon?  Why wait until years later?

I do not even understand Flagg's appeal in the group at all.  He was constantly getting overrun and captured by the bubble-head monsters.  He served no purpose other than trying to get his girlfriend back, which was a weak backstory.  He's like a super soldier or something?  Why does Waller want him?  He seemed like your standard soldier extra, to be honest.

I did not care about the relationship quinn had with the joker and it did not feel real to me. It felt like I was watching some high school drama with the insecure girl who wanted to piss her parents off by hooking up with the school bad boy.  The joker seemed like your standard street thug #10 in another movie, but with makeup and annoying grunts and laughs.  The scene with him laying down in a room with the ornate knife decoration thing ruined him for me.  Who actually does that.  How is that an actual trait anyone would have in the real world, insane or otherwise?  I thought the DCEU was supposed to be gritty and realistic.

I liked El Diablo, but his character should have been explored more.  He was the only believable guy to me.  The other ""bad guys"" were not internally consistent with their supposed beliefs.  They could have easily broken a cell phone.  Hell, deadshot could have destroyed it with one shot while it was sitting in her pocket.

About halfway in, the visuals couldn't salvage it anymore for me.  I was totally bored and wanting it to be over.  So apparently their mission was to rescue Waller from one room in the building and escort her to the roof where some other team was going to evac her out?  LOL wut?  Then, after sharing almost no chemistry, the group decides to take on an outmatched set of villians who are susceptible to small bombs?  Boys, we have missles that can do that.  And if a bomb could stop her machine (one that needed to be triggered by a bullet? LOL), we have missles for that too. 

In fact, where was the military during all that?  At the very least you would have the type of military presence we saw in Godzilla.  But they were like, ""Nope. Waller, if you say a guy with a boomerang and another guy with ropes can fix this, we won't even try.""

No Wonder Woman?  No Flash?  Hundreds of people dying and no response from anyone.  I go back to what I said, this is like the modern ""Batman Forever"".

d66jhpc,"I did a review here: http://www.weeatfilms.com/film_reviews/suicide-squad-so-thats-it/

MAIN POINTS: 

1. Having Joker in the movie seemed like a total afterthought. He meant nothing to the plot.

2. Leto's Joker had the crazy down, but NO SENSE OF HUMOUR. He laughs sometimes, but doesn't crack wise, and seems to be unable to take a joke. It's a little too far in the other direction from Ledger, Hamill, and Nicholson. Joker is supposed to be funny. Even if it's not funny to us it should be funny to HIM. 

3. The Suicide Squad (and DC films in general) needed a smaller, scaled back, more localized threat. Not another ""world ending machine muahahaha!"" Enchantress was a bad choice of villain for their first (and maybe last) outing.

4. Dialogue was very stilted in a lot of scenes, leading to bad delivery from good actors.

5. Croc's voice was TOO filtered and inhuman. He should sound animalistic, but still like a man, not a voice processed on a computer. 

6. Most of the cast was still solid. Smith and Robbie were standouts, but also had way more focus than the rest of the team. ",4w86a7

d6528tv,"I just don't understand why DC can't write realistic human actions. My major gripes is the writing. I rolled my eyes hard when Diablo says ""I lost one family I won't lose another"" or when Harley stabs the enchantress choosing her ""friends"" over Joker. They have all been hanging out for all of 12 hours, 14 tops. No you aren't friends and no you aren't family actually you're all supposed to be evil villians except the most evil person in the movie was Waller. She killed that role and best part of the movie was when she killed her whole team point blank, she didn't even hesitate. This movie felt too campy also cutting away from the gore and murder just to keep it pg-13 when the movie would have been so much better as a R rating. If they wanted a good example of bad, evil men working together they should have looked at The Usual Suspects for some motivation. None of the suicide squad was selfish or necessarily bad. Shit to be honest non of them realistically should have been in the final fight. Movies wasn't terrible it was just ""eh"". It was a DC movie was else could we have expected. ",4w86a7

d68r74i,"I really wanted to like this movie *WAYYYY* more than I actually did.  By the time the second trailer came out, I was convinced that this would blow Batman vs Superman out of the water.  Everyone seemed to have the potential to really bring these characters to life and it looked like Warner Brothers finally made a DC movie showing they understood the source material and could stand up to any of the Marvel movies.

While not a train wreck, I think most of us can agree that there are plenty of things in this film that could have been VASTLY improved on.

First off, it really only felt like the movie was about four people: Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Rick Flag, El Diablo.  Everyone else?  Stuck with throw away lines, spouting exposition and being nearby to pose with the Squad or toss around bad guys.  I definitely didn't get a sense of camaraderie from them working together nor feel they were like a family that El Diablo claimed he didn't want to lose.  

However, Viola Davis as Waller kicked ass and it felt like she actually understood her character in and out.  And while I appreciate seeing a new spin on the Joker rather than trying to simply follow in the footsteps of Ledger, Nicholson, or even Hamill, I don't like gangsta Joker.  It felt weird to see him covered in bling and the tattoos still leave a bad taste in my mouth.  Leto did good considering what he had to work with and the performances he will be compared to, but I think an issue with why it wasn't that great is the same problem as to why the film wasn't that great.  The pacing.  

When Joker first showed up on screen, i thought ""Oh cool!  There's our new Joker!""  And then I thought, ""Why is this so underwhelming?""  And it hit me.  There was no build-up.  It was just another thing thrown in to appease the comic book crowd.

Remember the tension of the opening bank robbery in the Dark Knight?  Most people knew the Joker would show up, but Nolan let the suspense build and build until finally we can't take it anymore and then *BOOM!* Holy shit.  Joker.  This dude is up to no good.  A character like the Joker needs an intro like that to remind people he is dangerous through and through.  Even Burton knew this with his Batman film, keeping Nicholson covered in darkness until he finally reveals himself and begins to shoot a mob boss to death to creepy carnival music.  Instead, we get Leto in a straight jacket out of nowhere.  No buildup.  Just there to be there.  

Nothing in this film felt like it was building up to any real payoff.  Not the reveal of the Joker, not the initial attack in the subway by the Enchantress's brother, not when Slipknot dies (someone smartly pointed this out earlier on in the thread), not when El Diablo was finally coerced into using his powers, not the scene when Flag comes forward with what the squad is really up against, nor the final battle against Enchantress to save the world.  Everything just kinda kept happening, not slowing down to give the audience a chance to see for themselves certain things.  Like the real threat of Enchantress's master weapon or the motivation or desires of ALL the Suicide Squad members.

There is so much more I could whine about like the overuse of music (Don't even get me started about the music they used when Harley threw herself into the vat of acid and Joker chased after her), or how unoriginal most of the set pieces were, or how cliche and stereotypical a lot of the dialogue was. But, I still had fun at some parts.  It wasn't terrible, which is good (I guess) but it was about as plain as a comic book movie can get.  

From here on out though, I can't trust Warner Brothers/DC trailers to mean anything anymore.  Batman vs Superman had great ones and...that speaks of itself.  Suicide Squad had great trailers and this definitely has a long way to go before I would call this movie ""good"".  If Wonder Woman turns out to be a disappointment too, I'll just assume that these movies are simply cash-n-grab franchises, not films for fans.",4w86a7
d64w5t3,The one thing I was most disappointed about was the way Joker felt like any old thug. He didn't feel different from any regular drug dealer or car jacker or whatever. Felt like someone who Batman could easily take down.,4w86a7

d656na2,"*So we’re some kind of suicide squad?* - Deadshot  

That’s Fan4stic level crap.  



**The Good**  
- Will Smith as Deadshot. He had some good dialogue (not a lot of that otherwise), cool scenes and a proper backstory. We get to know him and understand his motivations, even if they’re shoehorned down our throats at points. (We get it, he’s doing it for his daughter)  
- Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. She puts in a good performance with a shitty script and she’s interesting. However it feels a bit too much like she was written to become a “classic portrayal”. As if the WB execs demanded she be memorable by adding as many quirky lines and scenes as possible. Even before the movie came out people were proclaiming that “I can tell her performance will be remembered for a long time”. Overall good but could have been so much better.  
- Jai Courtney as Boomerang. Supporting role fit him really well. Good comedic relief but he should have been the only one. Instead every character had to have a few one-liners to make the movie “funnier”.  
- Amanda Waller. Best parts were unfortunately in the trailers but she was still convincing as the “evil” commander doing whatever is necessary.   


**The Bad**  
- Extremely sloppy editing. Scenes felt like they were thrown together at random at times. Sudden cuts to flashbacks and tonal shifts made for a jerky a experience.  
- The team becoming friends did not feel earned. Diablo sacrificed himself for his “new family” and Quinn killed Enchantress because she messed with her friends. Where did all of that come from? Was it all because of that very forced bar scene that came out of nowhere?  
- Joker was interesting but needed way more screentime or none at all. This in-between with random scenes could not establish the character properly. Like Harley Quinn he seemed to be written to be memorable, without earning it, by combining crazy outfits, tattoos, sets and dialogue along with sporadic laughing. His relationship with Quinn was also very underdeveloped and didn’t explain why she loved him so much after he tortured her. Had some very cool visuals, like his ring of weapons or with Quinn in the bath, but they had no narrative backing.  
- Why was Katana working with Waller and Flag? Very lazy flashback to establish her character!  
- Killer Croc needed more screentime or should have been left out. Suffered from too many side characters.  
- Diablo was cool but his best scene was shown in the trailer when he finally used his powers. Had a backstory that was suppose to be emotional but again the flashback didn’t really fit in. At the end he had some kind of connection to Enchantress and Incubus but it wasn’t explained. His “super skeleton form” looked like really bad CGI.  
- Enchantress was interesting in the beginning but not as the villain. Why did Waller just have her brother lying around? What was her plan, something about creating a machine? Why did they alter her voice so much? Why get such an inexperienced actress for the main villain?  
- The idea of Batman arresting the villains was cool. But if they already had Batman and the Flash, why did they need a team of villains? Also the Flash has still not been introduced properly but shows up randomly yet again.  
- In BvS Batman finds files about all the future Justice League members on a computer. At least that was used as foreshadowing for future movies, in this one that’s how all the characters were introduced. Instead of introducing them in separate movies or showing us who they are, let’s just have someone literally read a list with all their names and explain who they are to the audience.  
- They needed the “metahumans” to fight “the wars”. What wars? Who were they fighting, Incubus only showed up after they were approved. Waller even called it WW3 but never explained what that was?
- Also turns out everything could be fixed with explosives anyways. The Joker and Quinn escaping? Just shoot down their helicopter. (They survived but Waller seemed happy with it). Incubus messing you up? Just blow him up. Big generic light pillar destroying shit? Just blow it up!  
- Who shot down their helicopter at the beginning? How did they survive without seatbelts and flipping over fifteen times?  
- How did Waller survive her helicopter crash? How did she survive Enchantress tentacle things and show up just fine two minutes later?  
- Why did they need to go rescue Waller in the first place? Why was she in a random room in the middle of the city when all the other military people were fine in their room somewhere else?  
- As Boomerang said, why would any of them care about 10 years off their sentence?  
- What happened to the “mean guard”?  
- Why didn’t the Joker just break into the prison from the start to get Quinn if he could do it at the end?
- Deadshot and Quinn agreed to kill Flag and his men to escape. Two minutes later when Flag is getting killed by the monsters Deadshot tells Quinn to save him because “if he dies we all die”. But that was your plan just moments ago???  
- The city setting was very bland and boring and it was so obvious they had removed all the people not to get flak like they did for MoS.  
- The soundtrack had good songs but quite a few felt like they were just thrown in randomly. Gave me the feeling they were trying to do what Guardians of the Galaxy did so well with using established songs along with an orchestral score, so they just had to cram in enough pop songs for a full album into the movie.  
- They honestly didn’t really feel like villains. People kept telling us they were villains and the characters themselves loved reminding us about it but they never really showed it.",4w86a7
d64to11,"For a movie where the characters kept saying they're the bad guys they really didn't show them do anything bad.

Why didn't they just make Joker the main villain? I liked Leto in this but he was pretty much wasted.

Was it the same guys that were traveling with them during the zombie ridden adventure quest to rescue the boss lady? I would've preferred to watch a movie about them and their story. It would have ended in a tragic sacrifice for humanity. And something that really bothered me was the scene in which Diablo is thinking back to when he killed his wife and children, he's holding his wife in his arms and crying. She's perfectly fine!

d65eg3h,"First of all, I'm not a harsh movie critic by any means. I LOVE comic book movies, and understand that there is absolutely nothing wrong being a ""mindless"" action movie. However, there comes a point where we have to stop supporting this... This movie is so remarkably lazy. Lazy editing, lazy script, lazy cinematography. I will admit that the actors (or most of the actors) were giving their best efforts.

I didn't find any scene in this movie particular memorable. Also, I didn't really understand any character's motivations. Viola Davis, Will Smith and Margot Robbie were the obvious highlights. To me, Leto's Joker came off as a love-sick petulant child trying to prove how crazy he is. That's not a knock on his performance, but just a reminder that a good actor can only make so much of a mediocre script. Also, Cara Delevingne was truly awful.

To me, the worst aspect of the movie was that so much was built around the assumption that the squad bonded as a team and truly cared about each other (For example, Diablo's family comment), but nothing in the movie showed them developing this bond. Once again, it was just lazy.

Honestly, I'm just afraid if we keep supporting these idiotic-poorly-made-comic book movies, our recent comic book renaissance will revert to the debacle that was the comic book movies of the early 2000's (Looking at you Catwoman).

Because that shot *always* looked like something they threw together *just* to make a ""cool"" looking shot, and that's the fucking worst.

So good. And his lines were like, so funny, like, the one in the beginning, I don't really remember what it was, but it was totally awesome, and the one near the end, where I was like ""Wow, this is so funny, I totally see why he is in the movie!"", and then, when they are in the bar, and Rick Flag says they are free to go, and he IMMEDIATELY stands up und leaves, and I thought ""Yeah, that makes totally sense for him to do, because he was just trying to survive and get away for the whole time"", but then in the next shot he is again there with the team on their suicide mission, which was so surprising, I totally did not see that coming, and I was immediately wondering what secret motivations he could have that had been hidden from us in all the scenes we have seen before - he has to have them, otherwise this would just make no sense at all and would just be dumb.

Other complaints: 3 helicopters crash and no significant characters die.

No one really cares that Diablo literally saved everyone and sacrificed himself

Joker is not so much a psychopath but more of a weird fetish type of dude. Anyone can be into weird things but I feel like every flash back scene with him in it was sexual. 

The movie felt like it was trying too hard. The squad was trying to be a group of witty misfits rather than bad ass villains.

Anyone else have trouble taking Diablo seriously with his Mexican cholo accent? 

Killer croc turned out to be a stereotypical hood ass black dude. 

That scene in the end when they pull the witches heart out. ""Her heart is out she's weak get her!"" So corny... Way to state the obvious like we didn't know that her heart was her main power source.

Some very funny bits and others that would have been funny if they weren't so clunky.


Why did croc speak so slowly? It killed a lot of his jokes. Was hard to understand him half the time.


Why should we care that Katana's sword captures souls? It has no bearing on anything. It doesn't make the sword more dangerous. It seemed like they were setting the sword up to capture one of the baddies souls in, but that never happened.


Why was Rick Flag carrying around Deadshot's daughter's letters? Awfully convenient that he had a selection of them in his jacket right when he needed to appeal to Deadshot's emotions. 


Amanda Waller murders a few FBI agents for the flimsiest of reasons. They were govt employees helping them with the battle. Rick Flag doesn't give a shit about it, yet he grills Deadshot about being a contract killer. They try to make him out to be a moral person but he just shrugs off the murders like they were nothing.


They could kill the evil brother with a relatively small bomb. How come no one tried to just blow up the building the two baddies were in? We're supposed to believe the entire US Military couldn't destroy one building? At least show them trying and failing. In screenwriting it's called *Why can't they just?* You always show someone trying to make a phonecall to establish that the characters are cut off from the outside world. You show people trying to poen a locked door to show they are trapped in a building. This is basic shit.


The post credits scene was information we had already in the teaser trailer for Justice League. Could they not have saved something new for fans? Isn't that kind of the point of those? (as Marvel uses them anyway)

Amanda Waller was as evil as any of the actual villains. Why the fuck do they have Bruce Wayne doing deals with her? Why is she still alive at the end? She murdered innocent people and is responsible the entire catastrophe. She faced no punishment except feeling a little worried about her safety. A better post credits scene would have been one of the Squad killing her.

Some great laughs from Harley Quinn. Loved the underwater scene where Batman rescues her. The gag with the prison guard asking them to clear his browser history was brilliant. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs getting freaked out when Enchantress touches him was funny.


Will Smith and Margot Robbie put in great performances. Jai Courtney was bizarrely unwooden and even made me laugh a couple of times. Pity they were given clunky dialogue at times. The Diablo guy was good. Him being as powerful as the ancient baddies and having the ability to transform into a giant kind of came out of nowhere.


The Batman scenes were decent, as was basing it off the fact that Superman dies in the previous film. That made it feel more like a shared universe than the forced scenes in BvS where they reveal Aquaman and the others. 


The most frustrating thing was this film had some great ideas and lots of good scenes but the writing was sub par and felt very rushed. With a bit more polishing of the script and some more pacing and intensity in the final battle, this could have been an amazing film.",4w86a7

Harley Quinn nails the role 

Viola Davis is a fucking badass 

DISLIKE: 
The Plot is ridiculous, I would have loved for it to be more a small mission without fireworks and saving the world. 

I didn't buy Will smith as a villain. But that is just Will smith always playing good guys. He just doesn't fit the bad guy role. 
 
Leto seems to be playing a Guy who is trying to impersonate the Joker and not the Joker himself. But after Jack Nicholson and Ledgers  jokers... the bar was set high. 

Final battle of the two giant dudes wrestling... well, should I say more?

d64tkw4,"I thought the theatrical cut of BvS was OK at best but actually enjoyed that more than Suicide Squad, albeit not by much. Whoever is cutting trailers for Warner needs a goddamn raise.

THE PROS:

+ Performances. Smith, Robbie, Davis, Hernandez and Kinnaman in particular were really good.

+ Visuals. DC shit over Marvel when it comes to this, and the film sure as hell looked great.

+ Character banter worked really well. Not too surprising as Ayer has a lot of experience with that sorta thing.

+ Random Flash cameo. Really didn't expect that.

+ Jai Courtney finally gives a performance that didn't make me feel like I had cancer.

THE CONS:

- The plot was total dogshit. It's not surprising they left it out of the trailers because it's immensely forgettable. The problem is this makes it hard to get invested in the suicide mission.

- The opening is really messy. It's basically Viola sitting at a table reeling off expository back stories and is basically the laziest way to introduce characters imaginable. The super-choppy editing is also quite unpleasant.

- Pandering overuse of pop music is total overkill and really took me out of a few scenes. Quite a few of them would've been more effective with no music at all.

- Cara Delevingne was fucking ATROCIOUS in this. Honestly I believe she deserves a Razzie, mainly for her part in the third act of the film where she's jolting around spasmodically and talking with a hammy accent (I know it's closer to her native accent). I laughed every time she was on screen and not in a good way. It probably didn't help that all the CGI looked so shitty too.

- Pretty much anytime the film tried to be super-serious and emotional it fell flat, namely Deadshot and his daughter and Flagg and Enchantress. I really didn't give a shit about the latter yet it sucked up so much screen time.

- The villains were SHIT. Enchantress' brother looked like something out of Gods of Egypt.

- Generic CGI overkill finale. Just didn't give a fuck about it.

- Leto's Joker didn't really touch the sides. He seemed game but the script just wasn't strong enough and he didn't get any big iconic moments.

- Action sequences are mostly anonymous and I don't really remember much about them.

- That random shot of Flagg destroying a chicken drumstick. Seriously, why the fuck was that even in the film?

- Slipknot has about a minute of screen time.

- The ""Noooooooo!"" in El Diablo's flashback was hilariously corny. Jesus.

- Poor character balancing. Some of the squad disappear for ages and are largely underdeveloped.",4w86a7
d657wig,"[Suicide Squad](http://manapop.com/film/suicide-squad-2016-review/) clearly suffers under the problem of too many characters to introduce and explain for one movie, and the plot is basically a rip off of **Escape From New York**, but there were some entertaining moments and Margot Robbie made a good Harley Quinn.  This movie is better than [Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice](http://manapop.com/film/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-2016-review/) but not by a lot.

**Random Thoughts:**

* Waller makes Deadshot give her a marksmanship demonstration to see how good he really is even though he is known to be the best shot on the planet. Dumb and unnecessary.

* Joker keeps popping in and out of this movie but has no bearing on the plot whatsoever.

* We are introduced to squad member Slipknot without any backstory or explanation of his abilities. He is there simply to demonstrate the effectiveness of the nano-bombs placed in their necks.

* Amanda Waller murders her people in cold blood because they weren’t “cleared” for what they witnessed. Why the fuck was her staff not cleared? This is some Bond villain level bullshit.

* Captain Boomerang carries around a pink plush horse toy. No explanation given. I kind of like that.

* Rick Flagg has a badass assistant named Katana who seemed to have wandered in from a different movie.

* Diablo confronts the Enchantress because he “Won’t lose another family!” What the hell? He considers this group of murderers he’s known for a whole of twenty minutes family?

Margot Robbie was pretty awesome as Harley, but I feel all of her moments were spoiled in the trailers. I think her best moment is on the car after the helicopter crash in the rain. She showed real vulnerability.

I liked Leto, but felt like we either needed more of him or less of him. I liked that his character was kind of a throwback to classic mobsters who 'run the town'. I can see how his portrayal isn't for everyone though.

Waller was a fucking badass.

d65wk74,"There's a lot wrong with it, but the real reason it wasn't good was that they didn't take any advantage of their unique selling point - the main guys are bad guys. As it is, you can swap out any of the Suicide Squad with generic hero number five and get the same result: hero with superpower fights hordes of faceless alien robot things and saves the day. 

Heroes are limited by their own personal morality, and bad guys aren't. That means bad guys can do things that heroes can't. We needed to see that movie.

Imagine if instead of faceless alien henchmen, we had the Suicide Squad fighting real people. Terrorists, a private army, a collection of nasty people who do nasty things, whatever. And instead of going through the motions of killing or subduing them like any other hero would, lets take advantage of the fact that our guys are sadistic bastards.

What if Killer Croc bites a guys head off. Blood sprays everywhere, gets in drunk Captain Boomerang's eyes and he starts flailing around blindly, killing some goons and accidentally chopping off Rick Flag's hand. Rick Flag tries to blow him up with his phone death app, but pushes the wrong button and Slipknot explodes instead. Meanwhile, pinned down without his guns, Deadshot grabs the severed head of the guy Croc ate and beats three bad guys to death with it.

d653916,"So disappointed. Love DC and the animated Suicide Squad movie (if you haven't seen it go do that now) but this didn't work for me at all.

* Poor 'dialogue', most of it felt like singular quips about the situation (usually by Harley) and not actual dialogue. When there was dialogue I felt like it was pretty cheesy and not delivered well

* Lack of chemistry between the characters. Just didn't feel it, they tried to force a few moments with El Diablo calling the team his family and of course Harley's coup de grace on Enchantress but I just didn't think things had been built up that way. These guys are ruthless, selfish criminals who have known each other for a day or so. Just don't buy them as a happy family

* Unfitting end game: I think the villain is way too big of a situation for the suicide squad. End of the world baddies should attract the attention of actual superheroes. What made it more disappointing was that both supervillain problems were easily solved by the use of explosives. Really. That's all you needed the whole time.

* Character issues: Waller is an actual bad ass in the comics, she gets shit done her way regardless of who is in her way. In this movie she acts tough enough but is completely incompetent. She causes an crisis by losing control of Enchantress and then during said crisis she diverts her super team to kinda sorta rescue her instead of sending them against the villain, then gets captured and is used by enchantress to fuck over the US government. She didn't feel formidable by the end of the movie at all. Boomerang felt kind of weak too, he wasn't that useful as a team member

* Completely unnecessary spec ops guys. The whole SEAL team aspect was completely unnecessary, it made things feel like a military movie and took away focus from the supervillains (the actually interesting characters, well ideally). And then croc just kills them anyway I guess for no reason. 

Mixed Feelings

* Joker. Not sure how I feel about him. I actually liked his look but he didn't really feel like Joker to me, he just seemed like a crazy gangster. I think it's a shame to add him in as a side note on an already crowded movie but it's kind of hard to have a movie with Harley Quinn without Joker making an appearance

There were some good parts, I liked Deadshot overall he was pretty badass at fighting but the writing was weak like for everyone else. The characters definitely looked the part. Batman was used in the right amount and Margot Robbie was insanely hot. Overall I think it's hard to make a execute a good ensemble movie with such colorful characters but such little background.

d65eura,"Even if you didn't know about the reshoots already, you'd be able to tell how chopped up this movie has been. Character arcs head nowhere, plot points can be dropped on a dime. The entire film, but especially the opening, looks like it was edited by someone suffering a seizure. The opening tries to pass it off as a stylistic choice, but (and I swear I don't mean this as elitist, you'll feel the exact same for yourself) you can sense the desperation behind it to clean up this mess they've made of B-roll on the floor. Flashback scenes are clearly meant to have more happen in them, but they've got to hurry to the next scene with this villain that I don't give a shit about so those flashbacks get culled.

The three performances that people seem unanimous on are Margot Robbie, Will Smith, and Viola Davis. They're right. I liked Jared Leto's Joker, even though his character's involvement seems butchered the worst in all this. If he would've organically only had eight or so minutes in the film, that wouldn't be a fault. After all, Hannibal Lecter and Pinhead are both especially iconic villains and they only appear in a few minutes of their respective films. But you watch Suicide Squad and each scene with him seems like it was meant to have more attached to it originally. Critics mention that he doesn't have a memorable scene that matches Heath Ledger. Hell, I would be willing to believe that scene was snipped out because it didn't fit into this ""we edit our movies on meth"" dynamic that DC seems stuck to. 

Also, I loved Diablo. He was shafted into a smaller role but there is still enough here to make him a character I want to see more of. There is one scene (that is shown somewhat in the trailer) with Joker and Quinn that I think is exceptional. I love the dialogue, I love the music choice for it (thank God they didn't ruin this one by choosing some ironic top 40 tune), I love that DC almost lets the moment breathe before strangling it and moving on to the next shoot-out that seriously looks like it belongs on a straight-to-DVD Woody Harrelson crime thriller. 

I like Jai Courtney. Never thought I would say that. He doesn't seem to have much to do here and again, that is likely the fault of the studio filleting this finished product. 

David Ayers seems so uninspired here. There were more than a handful of scenes that I thought, ""If only the direction had a little interest in being less 'shoot-by-numbers', it would make this bit so much better."" I haven't seen End of Watch. I haven't seen Fury. But I remember Training Day as a movie where talented actors manage to make a damn decent film out of an average script that would've been forgettable without them.

Do I want another Suicide Squad? Yes. I want this cast, including Leto as Joker. Bring in Edgar Wright, like you're snatching up Marvel's ex-girlfriend. Start some beef. Then give him full creative control. Just do better than this. I watch that first trailer and I still want to see THAT movie.",4w86a7
d64ulms,"Just saw it. Boy, where to start?

Major spoilers ahead:

The editing in this movie is a mess. Like a real, serious mess. I knew they had to do reshoots to try to spice up the comedy and the dialogue, but man did they force the jokes early and they really felt flat. There was very little set up for the ""funny"" dialogue or quips. Also most of the jokes seemed based on Harley Quinn saying something zany or crazy and the joke always seemed to be about them being ""bad guys"" or her being insane. It sank into predictability pretty quickly and suffered from bad comedic timing as a result of rushed editing.

The characterization was also really poorly done. The movie violates the rule of ""show, don't tell"" a lot early on. There's a ton of exposition over Deadshot's and Harley's backstory, but the others, except, oddly, Enchantress, who has a larger role in the movie than I'd expected, get glossed over fairly quickly. Deadshot is basically hitman Will Smith (there's a ton of those trademark quips and jokes from Smith that reminds me of too many other characters he's played) and Killer Crock talks like a New York gangbanger for some reason (he calls Harley Quinn ""shorty"" at one very painful point). 

A large part of this movie is spent trying to shove scenes that make these characters more sympathetic down our throats, but the movie also has to constantly remind us the characters are ""bad guys."" The movie probably uses the phrase ""bad guys"" more than any film in recent memory, as if it's constantly trying to remind the audience of who these people are. Anyway, the character development feels clunky and forced and the story really features a gross overabundance of flashbacks in trying to flesh out its characters, which screws with the pacing.

The Joker does basically nothing in this film and Jared Leto is certainly crazy, manic, and deranged, but he's also not very interesting as far as his character goes. He doesn't seem to have much purpose in the story except as a centerpiece for the glut of Harley Quinn flashbacks the film forces on the audience. 

Ultimately, the story is just an uninteresting mess. An ensemble cast like this would really benefit from a more linear story and far fewer flashbacks. The threat at the heart of the movie is as convoluted and poorly developed as the characters and the film just shoves sentimentality down our throats in a desperate attempt to try and make these villains more heroic than they really need to be.

I saw the movie with Czech subtitles and at the point when the movie starts listing trivia about Harley the subtitles couldn't keep up with everything, so the main thing that popped up was ""She killed Robin"". ",4w86a7
d660e5g,"I can't help but feel frustrated writing and thinking about what I've just watched, much like I did after Batman vs Superman. But in many ways there were very different problems with the two. Suicide Squad is an entirely different beast in my opinion.

I think the problems with Suicide Squad doesn't really lie in it's foundations, (or the pre-production). I don't think David Ayer deserves the majority of blame for the critical failings of the film. I feel neither impressed nor underwhelmed about what he did with this film. Some of the direction was plain at times, sure there were nice little shots here and there, but I think that's all that can be said. 

I thought the casting was actually pretty fantastic. Each actor felt as if they matched the character perfectly, I didn't feel like I was watching Margot Robbie or Will Smith, I felt like I was watching Harley Quinn and Deadshot. The only character that I didn’t really feel sold on was Amanda Waller, her motives felt slightly empty, but this may have been down to having scenes cut.

Some problems could arguably stem from the story line. I didn't really have too many complaints, I'm not a massive DC fan and I don't entirely familiar with the SS, but I wasn't too against where the story line was going. My big complaint however is how they structured the story (I'll get to this in whole when I shit all over the excuse for editing in the film). There doesn't feel to be any defined acts in the film. It seems to go from 45 minutes of character introduction straight to an hour or so of blasting through the city. There’s been a lot of talk lately about the “Three Act Structure” and whether we need to move away from it – Suicide Squad is evident proof of how its needed.

The biggest problem with this film (with no great surprise) was editing. The film in this aspect just kind of is shit. I don’t think much more can really be used to describe it. The film felt very rushed and as if it was missing sections (something becoming more apparent with DC films). Firstly, I feel the characters could and should have been established in their origins. We should have opened with Deadshot in his hitman scene, and then gone to his scene with Batman. We would be able to establish his two sides of his character straightaway. The ruthless, greedy hitman, and the protective caring father. We then should have moved on to the rest of the Squad, establishing their characters – I feel this would have been particularly useful for Diablo, and would have greatly cut out the amount of over used flash backs. The one exception I’d make for cutting flashbacks is Harley – and that’s to continue her character development and give more context to the Joker. Her flashbacks would be used to understand her gradual descent to madness in order, so we can see her motives with the Joker more clearly. She is the one character I would defend using flashbacks for, instead of for all character and allowing the timeline to become interrupted and confusing.  

I do have more general complaints about the editing. I had read a few reviews on both Metacritic and Reddit from critics and fans, and knew the complaints before going in. And this actually played on my mind watching the opening half hour. I cannot think of a single shot that lasted more than 5 seconds. There were no shots to establish setting or context at all. If anybody can tell me I’d like to be corrected, but the whole opening section of the film felt like a messy, cluttered montage. I wanted to tear my hair out that the camera shot wasn’t hung on to for at least 1 more second just to slow the pace down. The quick snap cuts felt overused by the time we’d even met half the Squad. The content editing was very poor as well. We got good context for characters like Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and El Diablo, but nothing for Slipknot (although he was there to be basically killed off), Katana, and very little for both Captain Boomerang and Killer Croc. Even if we were to (dare say it) montage the less important members of the Squad in a 5 minute time frame to give some (or more) context of who they are and their personalities/backstory, instead of Waller just narrating who they are – which just feels lazy.

Overall the problem I have with this film is I really want to like it, but it’s hard to. I enjoyed a lot about it, but some overbearing structure and editing problems can’t allow me to see what was great about this film. A lot of people have been talking about the difference between DC and Marvel in light of SS and BvsS releases. The simple difference I can make is Marvel are producing movies, and DC’s films just feel like flicks.

I thought the movie was good & entertaining, but there was just so much going on at the same time. The Joker / HQ relationship was cool to see but Joker doesn't really do anything in the movie. Also, some other characters felt like the movie would be fine without them, mainly katana girl, aussie do nothing boomerang bro, and croc man.

Why did that make it necessary for her to bring out all these out-of-control criminals as the saviours of the city?

If all they had to do was blow up that portal thing that was destroying everything why the hell didn't they just do it when it appeared? Why did they need the squad? I mean all it took was a bunch of dynamite, couldn't they just bomb it? They didn't hesitate to bomb down the Joker's plane.

d674op5,"Here are my thoughts:

**On The Bad Side:**

1. This could work way better as an R movie, rather than a PG-13, but since DC realllly wanted to throw in all those characters and spent a lot of money, they couldn't afford to lose the child audience.
2. What's with it becoming a zombie movie halfway through? I mean, I felt like I was watching Resident Evil: Suicide Squad.
3. Can we call this movie Deadshot and Harley? I mean, there was barely any character background and stories with all these characters that DC wanted to flash. Yeah, it really bothers me that DC just wanted to show us all their cards but do nothing with them.
4. Joker Pimp :/ Sorry, not digging this new appearance, and Jared Leto is actually a talented actor...
5. The movie was a little bit confusing - the editing was weird and the pacing felt strange. 

**On The Good Side:**

1. It had a nice balance of fun and action, kudos there! the audience reacted well to a lot of the jokes and I had a fair laugh here and there.
2. The actors were wonderful each in their role. Will Smith was excellent, Margot Robbie was **LOVELY** and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje was a fantastic Killer croc, although he had like 5 lines in the entire movie, put his best in every line.
3. The action scenes were good.
4. That scene at the bar was top notch. The little character development I wanted to see, and it was great, more of that, please!
5. Oh, oh, nearly forgot, some of the visuals are really, **really**, good. That first enchantress transformation was bone chilling, even the design of the zombie-things was cool, like charred, bubbling black bubblegum.

All in all, it was an okay movie. Not bad, not great, just... okay, I guess a 6.5/10.

It had a great cast who all played their parts really well... They just didn't get anything interesting to do. 

Margo Robbie and will smith in particular did really well and got most of the laughs. 

What should have been great scenes were poorly shot. The joker Harley and common scene the camera was jumping all over the place. We get it, they are crazy, but the best way to portray that isn't to have the camera guy act like he's got multiple personality disorder. 

The joker seemed to only have about 2 minutes of screen time. 

The animated SS movie 'assault on Arkham' is a fantastic film, and this seriously fell short of that. 

Yes it had its moments, but they are few and far between.   

Honestly I can't tell you how disappointed I am in this film. My faith in the DC live action universe is spent. The trailers for this looked fantastic. 

I grew up with DC. Batman is my favourite superhero. The joker is my favourite Villain. The long Halloween is the best comic book ever written. The dark knight is one of the best films ever made.

Everyone in this movie acted well. 

Jared Leto's Joker was pretty cool, although I wish that laying with knives scene was as cool as it was in the trailer.

Not sure why Flagg and Waller didn't kill Boomerang for trying to escape with Slipknot, or shoot Harley for her attempted escape. You figure Amanda ""kill people who don't have authorization to see further"" Waller would be blowing their asses up.

Harley's changing accent was weird but I really liked Margot Robbie. Maybe my favorite scene in the movie is when she looks down in the vats and then asks Deadshot if he believes in love. Maybe that scene didn't really mean anything but it was kind of touching.

Katana should not have been in this movie. She was so out of place it was bad-funny. When she started talking to her husband in the sword all of a sudden out of nowhere I almost laughed.

The bar scene was lame. Flagg goes on about being a soldier and then he just fucking gives up.

The fight with Enchantress was some cheesy Ghostbusters shit that was just bad. Earlier in the movie we see Enchantress make Rick see some really fucked up shit. I don't know why at the end she does that trope where she ""shows them what they want."" That was bad.

On a side note: If we were falling comic book lore none of these guys felt ANY obligation to fight, deadshot wasn't a good guy, harley quinn did not have any morals, none of them felt like good people who do bad things, they were terrible people who do terrible things the whole redeeming scene where they leave the bar to fight the big bad was bullshit, they weren't in danger of being killed anymore, they would've left and left it to the other heroes, lets be honest.

But then it lacked the part where it explains or show how/why Harley could be so crazy about him. Where's Joker's manipulation? The thing that he does so well when toying with  her feelings. I hate to think that they intentionally omit the abusive bits to avoid backlashes. I mean, this is fucking Harley and the Joker, if they can't handle that side of the relationship, just don't have them. I wanted it because it would make Harley's character development so meaningful when she joined the squad. Being part of the squad made her realised that she could be independent of him and she could make friends then just being stuck with possessive Joker (in the comics and animated series Joker gets jealous when she makes new friends).

That first half was a complete fucking disaster. Had I downloaded this off a torrent and not seen it in theatre I would strongly suspect the uploader fucked up somehow, the editing and sequencing of things is just so weird.

The way the music was used was annoying. It felt so hastily inserted that it failed to do justice to both the songs and what was on screen. I think the music was only there to make the film more palatable. ""Here's your favourite songs!""

The second half was a lot better, and Robie and Smith really anchored things, as did their characters. Things actually kind of worked in the second half, but there was still lots that didn't. Diablo calling them his family was so contrived, Waller's plan never made any sense what's so ever, and there was still a lot of weird editing/structuring. There was a strange amount of repetition throughout the film. I didn't buy the Flagg/June Moon romance because it was hardly given more than 3 minutes. It would have worked better had they been a long term couple, wouldn't it? That way they would at least have a foundation instead of Amanda implying she orchestrated it and a couple scenes of them kissing. I did like the Flagg/Deadshot stuff though.

All in all it was about what I was expecting, probably a little better. I liked it more than BvS but that isn't saying very much, but at least it's some improvement? I don't think there was ever a great movie buried in here, but there was something better than this before it got hacked apart, of that I'm pretty sure.

As for the joker: why would they commit to a completely new version of the character if they only have a wee bit of screen time for him? And this version of him sucks, though I wouldn't blame Leto as I don't think he was handed anything good to work with.

Effects were top-notch, music was, well, it was okay.  But, jesus, the writing for the characters just didn't make sense half the time.  

* Deadshot:  look, I get that Will Smith essentially only plays different versions of himself, that's not a problem here.  What IS a problem is when you don't have Deadshot doing Deadshot things.  Why did he not ricochet bullets off the wall or some shit to hit Batman?  Why did he insist on using only the one gun for the most part throughout the entire movie, when his wrist-guns could let him shoot twice as much AND at different targets / in different directions?  They could have had him be a bullet wizard, instead it was simply 'Guy who shoots good'.  And where's the backstory for him feeling guilt over accidentally killing his brother, or ANYTHING like that?  Neat character to see on screen, obvious professional and bad-ass, but does not really scream Deadshot to me.

* Harley-Quinn:  okay, serious issues with Joker talking Harley into dunking herself into chemicals.  Why?  Seriously, what the fuck did that scene accomplish?  Also, her being the one to take down Enchantress, that's fine...but doing it with Katana's sword RIGHT AFTER the big-bad yanked all their weapons from the Suicide Squad's hands to her feet was just dumb.  Other than that, I loved her.  Robbie did a great job and Harley was not written bad at all.  A tough, lethal babe with an almost absent-minded care-freeness and LOTS of issues upstairs.  Also, her calling everyone else pussies was great.  Easily the best part of the movie.

* Amanda Waller:  why the FUCK was she in Midway City, or whatever it was called, if it was under attack?  It doesn't make sense that she needs to be right fucking there and potentially compromise the mission.  It's like that's here whole purpose for the latter two-thirds of the film, be a plot device to get the characters where they need to be.  Also have some issues with her killing the people with her once she's rescued.  That's just stupid and wasteful.  Waller may be a controlling bitch with no qualms about killing people who are threats, but those were her team.  That just felt like an enormously heavy-handed way to express to the audience, ""She's a bad person and you should like Deadshot & Co. more"".  The character being done well otherwise is really overshadowed by these writing fuck-ups.

* Flag:  he was boring but adequate to the task.  The relationship between him and Moon felt very forced, though.  Maybe if they had had a few extra minutes to flesh it out it would have been better, I'm not sure.  As it stands, he was an incredibly 'meh' piece of the film.

* Killer Croc:  neat seeing him on-screen, portrayed well, added some suitable degree of 'freak' to the criminal squad.  That said, I didn't care about him much at all.  I think they tried to portray him as sympathetic to a degree, but didn't spend the time to do so.  Really, Marvel made Rocket Racoon one of the best parts of GotG, Killer Croc should have gotten more time to shine as the man-eating monster here.  

* El Diablo:  they really needed to be doing something with him before he started letting loose.  He was just 'there' until then, a human-shaped paperweight.  That lecture in the bar just felt extremely ham-fisted, too.  His true power was neat, shame he wasn't utilized better.

* Capt. Boomerang:  why is it that Capt. Boomerang did almost nothing with his weapons except use them as blades in melee?  And what's with the pink unicorns?  They didn't explain that at all.  Was it weirdness JUST for the sake of weirdness?  Did they see Deadpool and think ""We need some of THAT"" or what?  He's a fun character, but again, weird choices made.

* Katana:  kick-ass chick, but I don't get how she fits in here.  Why is she Flag's 2nd in command?  What's her tie to ARGUS & such?  Again, too little time spent fleshing her out.  The one tearful confession to her sword just made it feel weird in contrast to how little else we got to see of her actual character.

* Slipknot:  uh, he was there?  Then he wasn't?  I dunno.  Not impressed, but I guess we weren't meant to be.

* June Moon / Enchantress:  man, I don't know where to begin.  Why did a professional archaeologist go into ancient ruins alone, and then immediately snap the neck off of an idol she finds there?  Why was there a giant ring of debris around Enchantress' magical super-weapon?  Was was she dancing and rhyming at the end when she fucked with their heads?  When did this witch learn to fight like a super-ninja?  Why was she bullet-proof one moment and vulnerable to a sword the next?  And Moon being miraculously being saved at the end?  Stupid, should've just let her willpower weaken Enchantress in the final fight so both could be killed, letting her die a hero.  So many questions, so many bad decisions.

* The Joker:  *sigh* Man, I don't know what went wrong here.  I was hoping for something on par with Ledger's Joker, or the one we see in the Arkham games.  This schmuck just came across as a slightly unbalanced mob guy.  Where's the sense of insanity, of diabolical planning, of psychotic rage against mankind and all its made?  They spent too much time making him dote on Harley when he should have been showing how masterful a criminal he is.

Honestly, DC needs to march over to WB / Snyder's office and start kicking some asses.  This should have been THE film that got them back on track to doing fun comic book movies.  Instead, it was just a mess.  Fun at times, but still a mess.",4w86a7
d6jwwss,"Civil War and Suicide Squad, hell even BvS are largely the same film, just with different characters.

However, what makes Civil War great in my eyes (and in the general publics), and not SS or BvS is that there were previous films whereby we as the viewers could understand the ambitions, goals, reasons for action of each of these characters.

For example, do you think that Iron Man scene in Civil War where he realizes Cap knew Bucky killed his parents would have weight if we didnt know anything about the characters?

I think BvS and suicide squad have a great film hidden inside of them. What they need is us to understand why these characters do things. When Bat man and Superman stop fighting just because one says ""Martha"", i legit started crying of laughter, because there is no premise for us to feel something.

Same goes to SS, where we are supposed to just assume that Deadshot does things for his daughter, without telling us anything about their relationship.

That is the underlying issue with DC Films thus far. Once these characters get their own movies, and we understand them better, once we look back at BvS and SS, I guarantee many, including myself will look back at them saying ""hey this isnt that bad""",4w86a7
d6sfn8a,"I thought it was okay but reading the opinions here I get the feeling it could have been so much better. Cut some of the unnecessary characters, keep the original mysterious enchantress and give her a better motivation than wanting to destroy the world for reason. Make the bad guys actually bad and give them proper motivation to work for Waller.

**Spoilers:** One scene that looked off to me was at the end when Deadshot aims at the flying bomb packet and his daughter appears *under* his gun instead of in the line of fire. This is supposed to mirror the scene where she stands in front of Batman. The scene would have been a lot more powerful if Deadshot were forced to shoot through the vision of his daughter.",4w86a7
d6vsgp6,"I'm late to all this but I just have to say... This movie has no idea how a soundtrack works. You don't just throw random cool songs into a scene to make them more interesting I guess. It made the movie seem like a big long music video, it was so weird. Also, Kinnaman did a great job I thought. ",4w86a7

I had fun with a few scenes and in the end I'm just happy I saw the movie and didn't sit in my chair the whole night regretting my decision.  

There's a lot more I want to talk about but I'm too lazy, but hand's down my favorite part is where deadshot starts taking out all the enemies in the middle of the city and ends up doing the entire team's work for them.",4w86a7

d64ujaa,"Go in with low expectations, and you'll be fine. 

Basically, everything the critics said was bad IS bad.  The editing, some of the cuts, the villain, plot holes and character holes are brutal. 

Scenes were cut (by the studio I imagine) from the trailers that would've probably answered the holes but alas, this is what we have. 

Sound track was great. One of the best in movies. Cameos, And character introductions I thought were great (they are hit or miss but I liked them)

What you thought about slipknot, you were right. 

Underused some members, idk what the thought was with Cara. It must have been the same thing with Hayden Christiansen from the Prequels (just.......why?) She could've been good but it looked like cuts got to her.

But with all that said, it was good enough to see, and I am going to buy the directors cut so I can see the true movie. ",4w86a7

d66halx,"Undoubtedly the worst film of the year...and I have seen Independence Day: Resurgence.

Suicide Squad was worse because it had SO much potential and character development and it completely abandoned any effort to explore that. It was clearly cut and stuck back together, that's why Rick Flag goes from having long hair and trusting Waller to a buzz cut and weirdly suspicious in the space of two scenes. The film jumped around without any explanation. It was amateurish and frustrating.

Character development was just not a thing here. They took 'show-and-tell' too literally here. Oh look, Will Smith has a daughter (who just could not act, it was painful) we must like him because we know why he's doing all of this. The flame guy - didn't care. Killer Croc got zero character development. Captain Boomerang had potential but because the other characters were so shit his chemistry didn't make sense. Harley Quinn was the best character but you just feel guilty enjoying Margot Robbie chew the scenery because everything else about the film is so terrible.

Honestly, this film was like an awful student essay that had so much potential. Somewhere along the lines it went completely off the rails but by that point the deadline was looming so you rushed to hand it in. 

DC simply cannot deliver the way Marvel does. Who'd have thought I want them to stop?",4w86a7
d67qovm,"Margot Robbie worked.  Her ""I'm so crazy, aren't I funny"" lines didn't.  Know when I loved her the most?  Telling Diablo to own it.  

Will Smith worked on all levels except some of the ""Welcome to Earth/It be rainin' black folks in New York"" lines.  I'm happy he entertained me because Big Willie Style is still one of my favorite CDs and damn anyone who tells me ""Candy"" isn't a great song.

Leto's Joker was a no-go.  I know a lot of people say they wanna keep seeing more of what this version has to offer.  I'm not.  When I heard Leto was cast I was enamored, Requiem still haunts my psyche.  

The only time I liked Waller was the one time some people feel like it was out of character.  You know the scene.  ""That was gangster.""
That's Waller all day.

Literally everyone else bored me.

It wasn't a terrible movie.  I honestly had no problem with it.  I just didn't really care for it either.  I'd say another miss for DC, but the box office doesn't seem to agree and enough fans enjoy it.  I'm not gonna hate on em for it, but I doubt I'd ever watch it again.",4w86a7

d65o18o,"I thought it was ok, but it seemed like every time there was something positive, they balanced it out with bullshit.

- Joker, I thought it was decent.  There were times where it was way over the top (the growling scene and the whenever he just laughs for no reason).  I actually liked him as a mobster, somewhat closer to Nickelson's joker in that aspect.
- Harley Quinn was alright, but her being ""craaaaazzy"" got old.  Also... a team of Navy SEALS were decimated by those henchmen and a former psychiatrist was able to kill a bunch with a fucking bat??
- Batfleck is pretty cool
- It's painfully obvious they went back and reshot a bunch of scenes last minute and the feel of the movie as we saw it was NOT the feel that was originally intended.
- First 3/4 of the movie it tries WAY too hard to be Guardians of the Galaxy, some of those scenes were actually ruined by the music  (and I liked every song they used, just not in that context).
- I didn't know Enchantress was related to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GznhT__PXs)
- Waller sucked, Viola Davis I know is a good actor but her scenes were so freaking weak, weakest was that thug shoulder check on Killer Croc as she walked out.  Seriously... how is she still alive?
- The introductions were freaking boring, they spent way too much time on the first two (Harley and Deadshot) and realized they didn't have enough time to cover the rest so they just half-assed it.
- Katana and Slipnot were so useless character wise, if you swapped who lived and who died, it wouldn't have changed a god damn thing about the movie at all.

Edit:  Also didn't realize... by the end of the movie they had killed the second most powerful Suicide squad member and depowered the most powerful.  Literally the only ""metahuman"" they have left is the guy with a skin condition.",4w86a7
d65xrc7,"It's a better concept than a story, and it's a more noble effort than BvS, but it's still largely a failure. The components of an excellent movie are here and you can definitely enjoy yourself, but several components necessary to a functional movie seem to be missing.

Stakes - For a movie named Suicide Squad, none of the squadmates seem particularly dangerous or imperiled by the main villain. Redshirt deaths are weightless and none of the squadies seem phased by the main villain. This is *fine* for a breezier film about character relationships, but the climax of the film is distinctly not about character relationships. They don't learn to work as a team - one character sacrifices himself, but his character arc was about self-control, not selflessness. Each squadmate even disappears into his or her own head during the climax.

The Joker - Leto's joker actually has more screentime than the reviews give him credit for. The problem is that his character has no narrative or emotional impact. The scene in which he hijacks a helicopter ends with the helicopter being shot down and another helicopter being called in (which is later shot down for a different reason). It doesn't drive the story forward. The scene could literally have been cut in post and the ends would've still more or less lined up.
And only people the Joker seems to affect emotionally are Harley Quinn and Ike Barinholtz. His henchmen serve him with cold military discipline, and for some reason, Common's tattooed man seems completely comfortable with him. Aren't villains supposed to be terrified of the Joker? All the things you can't show the Joker doing in a PG-13 film - all the ironic violence, all the domestic abuse, all the nihilist terrorism - can and should be implied through character reactions.
Captain Boomerang would have been a fine solution for this. All the terrified swearing you'd expect out of someone reacting to the Joker or an eyeball monster or the head explosives demonstration could have been PG-13-ified into Aussie gibberish. Instead, most everyone besides Deadshot just stands around looking cool (though, to be fair, they look pretty damn cool).

Efficiency - There are a lot of flashbacks in this film, and all of them are exclusive to a one of the squaddies. None of them are shared - no characters react (empatheticly or dismissively) to learning about another character's backstory (excepting Diablo's second family flashback, near the climax). The flashbacks are for the audience, but they only tell us about characters; they don't tell us about character dynamics. And you can't just split a 2 hour movie 6 ways. Guardians of the Galaxy only had 4 backstories and still made an effort to move Rocket Racoon's backstory to exposition - telling the story, but showing the reactions of his compatriots. Katana and Croc's backstories, thin as they were, could probably have been cut closer, or developed mid-narrative.

Motivational Arcs - I read somewhere that Deadshot and Diablo's motivational arcs seem clipped and I think I know where they're talking about. After the Squad lands, they plot to escape, but change their ways when they first see the eyeball goo monsters. Given how unphased they seem tearing through the monsters, their decision to postpone their escape plans rings false.
The end of the fight would've been the right place to raise the emotional states. Maybe make one of the eyeball monsters child-sized. The villain squadies all have a particular weakness for children, and this would've made their change in motivation more believable.
I suspect that something like this was originally shot, and later cut and replaced with Will Smith looking at a window display of children's clothing for the sake of a PG-13 rating. Chalk it up to inexperience dealing with the rating system; there are better ways to imply violence against women and children without stepping on any R rating tripwires.

tl;dr - This was David Ayer's first experience directing PG-13 film and it kind of showed. There are R-rated holes in this film where a well-designed PG-13 patch should be.",4w86a7

Jared Leto's Joker felt forced. The laugh sucked and the whole character didn't feel mad and was way more human than i would have liked.

d65hpf9,"Oh my god... At least coming out of BvS I could lie to myself for a couple days that what I saw was good. I think what Warner Bros. should learn from this is if you need that much awkward exposition cutting apart a movies flow, then the movie is clearly not ready to be made. Why are they rushing all this shit. Wonder Woman, Batman, Superman, the Joker. All of these characters are ridiculously popular. You don't have to rush this shit. Make their solo movies so that when we get to these collaborations, you don't have some of the worst explanations of why we should care that I have ever seen. The part with the Asian girl before the final battle where Rick Flag is explaining how her husband died, and she is praying to her fuckng sword was one of the cheesiest and shocking things I have ever seen the studio put on screen. You guys used to kill it with Harry Potter and the Dark Knight trilogy. What the fuck are you doing????????!!!!!!!!!!!! Flashbacks and standstill exposition in a god damn action movie every ten minutes is a horrible idea. Such a rushed concept. It really shows that you need a Kevin Feige type. Someone who knows the material, and knows how to put this shit together in a cohesive and compelling manner, and make a studio rich. ",4w86a7
d65l2r2,"Good: Smith, Robbie, Davis, and Hernandez all play their characters well. Most of the rest of the cast does the best with their roles and what was given to them. Visuals are solid for the most part. Leto is fine as Joker, but he's an extended cameo at best in this film.

Bad: Plot is a mess. Why are these guys being sent to do work alongside Navy Seals? Why not just send in more Seals rather than untrustworthy crooks? Copying Assault on Arkham's formula (it's a heist, so using bad guys makes sense) would have worked better. Villains are generic at best. Dialogue falters at times, and the pacing of the film falls apart at least a few times.

I'd give it a 6.5 out of ten. It's actually better than BVS, and probably doesn't deserve the bashing from most of the critics, but it's not a great film either.",4w86a7

d66h2ay,"I just thought it was such a mess.

The emotional moments weren't earned at all. There was so much cringeworthy stuff going on... I just can't believe how messy this was.

There were too many characters that don't do anything. Either cut them or flesh them out. For example:

- Why do we care that Katana's talking to her dead husband? Like... she's crying and that's cool? They should've given her a better arc. Maybe she's depressed about her husband's death and at first she thinks that she is doing the whole superhero thing out of anger and revenge. They could've shown her husband's death, and maybe he was trying to save someone's life when he got killed and she had to watch it happen and was helpless to save him. She bonds with one of the people on the team and they help bring her out of her shell throughout the night and she hasn't felt this happy since she was with her husband. Then in the final battle, the person that she bonds with almost gets killed and she kills Enchantress and sucks her soul into her sword. Katana feels vindicated because she was able to save her friend this time, and she realizes that she isn't doing the superhero thing because she's angry... she's doing it to honor her husband because he died a hero and she wants to keep his spirit alive. Out of her husband's death, she finds that she has a higher calling. 

Man, there's a lot of potential with these characters but... it was so wasted. ",4w86a7
d66hpd4,"I came out of Suicide Squad wondering why the filmmakers chose to have black ops street level villians fighting against a magic, global scale generic enemy complete with big glowing portal thingie in the sky. Made no sense, the villian was terrible, the editing was atrocious, the actions scenes were meh and to much all-mo and the story was all over the place.  If all they needed was a bomb, then why couldn't they just air strike the site? 

However, I did like Will Smith playing Will Smith (I mean Deadshot), Harley and El Diablo, coincidentally the only members to get any notable lines at all. And Viola Davis knocked it out of the park as Waller. Soundtrack was good. 

Joker I'm still on the fence about. I hate, hate the grille teeth and he seems more like a Tony Montana with quirks than a true Joker. Jared does have good chemistry with Margot though, they shine when they are on the screen together. I need to see him in his own movie. 

I came out of this movie wishing it was a Batman solo movie with Joker and Harley as the main villians. This movie didn't need to be made at all and was mildly entertaining at best. ",4w86a7

The ending it pretty rushed, how Deadshot ends up helping Flag saves his witch girlfriend to redeem HIMSELF is something that is so forced, almost makes me choked up.

d6ht41x,"Pros:

Deadshot is Will Smith's best performance since the original MIB.

Margot Robbie gave a performance that would make Paul Dini,Bruce Timm, and Tara Strong proud. 

Solid VFX

Great Soundtrack in most places (more on that later)

The Harley Quinn flashback with the car felt like a scne right out of Batman: TAS.

Similarly the Flash and Captain Boomerang scene made me hyped for the flash movie. 

Viola Divas as Amanda Waller...just wow

In general the tone fits the source material better then past WB efforts.

Solid art direction at points (especially El Diablo's aztec form)

Cons:

Several squad members felt completely useless. Will anyone really remember Katana three years or hell, even three months from now?

Captain Boomerang, while not a terrible character, needed more screen to establish why he is a cowardly dick and isn't in the climactic final battle. (Yes, I can't believe I am saying ""more Jai Courtney please"") 

Giving a entorage for the squad completely destroys the entire point of having it (to avoid government accountability)

Rick Flagg had a ton of wasted potential. I mean the dude fell in love with the main villain. Couldn't they have played that up more for some drama with Waller? Maybe more scene establishing his relationship with archaeologist chick could have helped. 

The way they handled the Harley Quinn subplot is really fucked up. They turned a abusive relationship into romanticized Hollywood romance. What the fuck WB! Did they really not see the problem here? 

Jared Leto's Joker gave off Johnny Depp Jack Sparrow vibes. 

Piss poor editing that exacerbated most of the aforementioned problems.  

Killer Croc was written as a racist stereotype of african americans (wearing a hoodie, watching BET,etc.). Again did no one at WB see that this could be an issue? This a really personal disappointment for me since I always thought Croc had a great ""emotional hook"" with being exiled from society and effectively hating himself.

Third act is terrible outside of a few moments with El Diablo. 

The choice to use a generic orchestra for the action sequences is disappointing.

Overall Score: 6/10 with the possibility of an 8/10 if the Joker scenes that remove the fucked up Harley Quinn moments are reintegrated into the plot in the home video release. The editing was the main thing that killed this movie. Which is a shame considering the executives are the ones in charge of this particular cut instead of David Ayer (Don't believe the PR BS WB is trying to pull.).

Also The Enchantress being a weak villain wasn't even the worst part. I felt like I was watching a villain from the 90's. It's so corny.

I don't get why Diablo suddenly called the squad family after he was so disconnected not long before that. I enjoyed the fight scenes (apart from the last but I'll get to that). I also loved the Harley and Joker scenes. The last fight seemed anti-climatic enchantress was defeated so easily. This ""goddess"" was easily tricked by Harley and don't get me started on Flag. He so easily crushed the heart and just turned away I don't know about you but I'd be crying and hugging my knees. I'm happy June lived though I felt bad for her throughout the film and wish I'd seen more of her. Now Diablo dying nobody seemed to fucking care!

d64ttq8,I'll start off by saying I enjoyed the movie. It's not great but I don't think it is 27% bad. I could have used more Joker and less Enchantress. I thought Will Smith was decent and he got the meatier back story but he didn't do much to make the character his own. Which I think really could have helped this movie. I tend to turn my brain off when it comes to comic movies and just enjoy the spectacle. But even doing that I did notice the glaring editing issues and tonal issues. Even noticing those though I can see the potential for a much better sequel if that gets green lit. I would give it a 6 out of 10. It really could have used more breathing room with the introductions and less time spend on a villain that was way too powerful for the team. If there was a lower stakes villain I think it would have helped rather than hurt the movie. But all and all it is a good popcorn flick and I look forward to seeing where the characters go in the future.  ,4w86a7
d67oj8i,"Best visual of the film was the enchantress transformation when they hold hands.

d64tkgp,"Just saw the movie, and I was pleasantly surprised! I was expecting a complete waste of a movie, a la *Fant4stic*, but it was pretty okay! Jared Leto was a bit meh as the Joker, but it's balanced out by the fact that he's only in roughy 10-15 minutes. It seemed that he showed up every half-hour, so at least you could keep track of the running time.

Will Smith Will Smiths it up, but at least he's somewhat sincere. Deadshot is basically a more world-weary, cynical version of his character in *ID4*. Margot Robbie is pretty good as Harley Quinn, though her emotional storyline is a little confused (since it's unclear if she wants to stop being a supervillain or not). Jai Courtney is a blast as Boomerang, but is sadly underused. Same for El Diablo, who is the heart and soul of the movie despite doing some heinous stuff. 

But the real MVP of the movie is Amanda Waller, since Viola Davis knocks it out of the park! Everyone else acts in the movie, but she gives a performance. It was electrifying to see ""The Wall"" leap from page to screen. 

The story was kinda meh, especially the big blue space laser shooting into the sky, but I didn't mind it because the characters were the main draw. Enchantress is a nothing villain as well, but at least she looks cool. And it was kinda obvious that there were reshoots, but there was only one glaring hint of it. Captain Boomerang ditches the group, only to show up a moment later to join in the final battle, which was pretty lame. I'd rather have him serve as a B-plot, trying to escape the team but eventually being forced into the final fight. 

As a movie I'll see once, it was much better than expected. I'm sure if I watched it twice I'd see a lot more flaws, but I don't see that happening anytime soon. Here's hoping *Justice League* and *Wonder Woman* will be improvements on this.",4w86a7
d6555py,"I've got to say, it was a fun movie. But it wasn't a good movie. I saw MoS but not BvS beforehand, but that did not prove to be an obstacle to my understanding of the movie, which gives it a point ahead of its obvious competitors in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.


**The Good**

Will Smith gave an excellent performance as Deadshot, he really carried the movie.

Margot Robbie played an excellent Harley Quinn, which I imagine must be a very difficult role to play.

Jay Hernandez gave the movie an excellent example of an obvious bad guy who you still felt sympathy for.

The action scenes were very fun to watch.

The soundtrack was really great, and used perfectly throughout most of the music (I won't talk about the use of Bohemian Rhapsody near the end).


**The Bad**

The plot was ridiculous. Nothing about the story made any sense or made you feel for the characters involved.

The villains seemed uninspired with unclear motives. I get that they want to kill all of mankind, but *why*. Because they're not treated like Gods?

Cara Delevingne ruined every shot she was in. She is simply a terrible actor. Nobody she says or does comes across as convincing. Here June Moon didn't make you feel any empathy and her Enchantress was not intimidating in the slightest.

Jared Leto ruined every shot he was in. It was like if he looked at Heath Ledger's joker, and the only part he used for his own performance was to do weird things with his mouth. He was just a weird green haired gangster who completely ruined any immersion, wasn't intimidating in the slightest, didn't show any sign of subtlety, I could go on forever. He was truly a disgrace to the Joker character. At least Cara Delevingne tried to play the Enchanctress and failed miserably, Jared Leto decided to give his own spin on a classic character and ruined every scene he was in as a result. Probably the worst part about the movie.

**Final Verdict:** 4,5/10",4w86a7
d65er95,"So, so many confusing scenes full of unnecessary moments that hardly support what exists of a plot line.    

--The Joker killing a guy in the club for saying something about Harley? If the purpose was to show how crazy the joker is, I was left more with a feeling of ""wat""  
--Why did the Joker zap Harley? He asked for a machine gun and she provided a small militia.  
--Why in the world does Waller sleep with the Enchantress' heart  
--Waller is saved by the crew and then I guess the writers didn't have any better ideas so they literally send her down in a helicopter to be captured again ... ?  
--Deadshot would most certainly have killed Harley given the deal he was given in that instant.  He's a hitman, he's known her for a day.  
--After Harley tries to escape, she's just unanimously accepted back in the crew with no questions asked.  
--Waller's argument for the Suicide Squad was nonsensical and showing off the witch stealing 'secret government secrets that we've been looking for for years' would convince no one  
--They literally gave deadshot a whole arsenal to 'see' how good he is... What in the world??  
--These criminals literally have no motivation to help out other than the app that kills them instantly, which they could easily snag off of whoever has it at the given time (or just kill the person who has it)  
--Waller's finger are literally on three of the members when she's holding up the phone  
--Killer Croc can't commit suicide so make him beat up the bad guys underwater while another guy goes to detonate himself  
--The Witch had maybe 5 body guards in the station she was making her ""weapon"" in, the crew literally waltzed right in

d66f0ms,"This movie was a series of half-assed montages, and mediocre action scenes strung together with a soundtrack of catchy pop music.

Basically, an extended trailer... all balanced on Margot Robbie's ass.

Will Smith played sad Will Smith. Jared Leto wasn't interesting or creepy or intimidating or funny—all necessary traits for Joker. Boomerang was forgettable. Diablo would have been better off in a soap opera; I didn't buy for a second that he gave a shit about any of those people, so his reversal and sacrifice made no sense. Joel Kinneman was okay, and the rest of them did what they needed to do. In short, they were serviceable.

Viola Davis was one of the only believable and entertaining aspects of this movie. Margot Robbie did pretty well as Harley Quinn, but unfortunately, David Ayer decided he needed to prop his shitty movie on her ass. I'm sure plenty of people are going to use this as an excuse to talk shit about the movie and probably Robbie's performance, but the fact is she was one of the bright spots. I wouldn't normally complain about a beautiful woman being featured in a movie, but in this case it seems to be an attempt to distract from the non-existent script.

I believe that Will Smith could have done much better. Maybe he did and Ayer just wasted him. Davis could have been featured much more heavily to even greater effect. Robbie's portrayal of Quinn seemed handicapped by shitty writing. As for Joker, Leto seemed to be trying to hard, but he could have been simply trying to make up for the terrible writing.

God damn! This movie was bad.

Edit: I mistakenly thought Tom Hardy was supposed to play Boomerang.",4w86a7
d67jq37,"Just saw the movie tonight. Here's my 2 cents.

**Cons**

- Enchantress was decent, but was her brother necessary to the story? I felt like he added nothing and everything could have been accomplished without him.

- The method of destroying the world was too generic. Giant beam in the sky, hundreds of faceless creatures. Boring.

- Went from 0 to 60 very fast. One minute were getting back story on the characters, next minute the villain is already attacking shit. There was middle ground missing or something. Could have used a bit more build up.

- Not enough Joker.

**Pros**

- Loved Harley Quinn. 

- I don't really understand the hate on Joker. He may not be Heath Ledger but I thought he was awesome and wish there was more of him.

- Deadshot was badass. That one sequence where he kills everything is dope.

- Loved the squad in general, they were great.

- Amanda Waller was also great. Good job on Viola Davis.

- Sweet Flash cameo.

Overall, despite the generic way that the world is being destroyed, pretty dull villain, and an odly paced plot, I thought it was great. Would see it again, will be buying it on Bluray.

Edit: After giving it more thought, I really fuckin like Leto's Joker. He's creepy, psychotic, menacing, manipulative, sarcastic. Can't wait to see more. And the tattoos didn't bother me at all, I didn't even think about them during the movie.",4w86a7
d680zpd,"Aside from Harley, i wish they would have acted like villains....

Accidentally shoot someone in Flags group? Show that they didnt care? 

I mean... these are the worst of the worst, and none of them have ever killed a woman? Or a child?

Superman in MoS killed more ppl than these villains. Kids and woman alike just due to his fights with Zod.

Im not saying they needed to show shit like that, but make me believe these people are bad. The movie spends more time trying to make me believe they are heroes, than showing why they were chosen in the 1st place.

Not to mention they failed on that many times.

I mean they could have at least had deadshot punch flag? When he reads the reports. Or have one of them do something truly questionable.




",4w86a7
d6kt8ro,"Movie has no plot and then somehow creates a plot out of thin air only to finally make progress of said plot at the very end. Half the time didn't know if the dialogue was trying to be funny or trying be edgy. Like the end where the witch says ""You don't have the balls."" You've got to be fucking kidding me. Worst movie I've seen in a while. Will Smith's character was the only good one. People saying Margot Robbie did a great job? Hell, she didn't do a bad job but there's no way in hell could anyone could have made that garbage good. Why the fuck was the Joker even in this movie?

",4w86a7
d67q2yv,"The editing before they get into the city was horrible, we had multiple introductions to characters who we already knew. 

There was a moment before the title screen where we were only introduced to Deadshot and Harley, which to me, showed they were the more central characters. 

The story was horrible, I did bear Ayer only had 6 weeks, but that isn't really a defence considering he probably knew he was directing the film months in advance. 

I LOVED the characters, I genuinely was invested in the Squad. Except Katana (not really part of the squad though) they didn't really need her. 

There was a little too much exposition in terms of their backstory, and I don't mean when Flagg talks about them at the beginning, I mean at the bar.

El Diablo talking about his family was out of the blue really and you could tell that the scene was there to push the story forwards since they didn't give themselves too much time outside of all the useless action scenes. 

Will Smith was a good Deadshot but he was too much Will Smith not enough Floyd Lawton sadly. 

Margot Robbie, Jay Herndandez and even Jai Courtney were actually brilliant in this film, aside from some of the silly lines they had. 

I didn't hate the romance between Flagg and Moone but they could have done it in a more natural way instead of just telling us. 

The big bad was atrocious, if it were just about the squad and Enchantress I would have preferred that, even if the plot was just Waller wanting Enchantress for the squad and they had to hunt her down. 

Some aspects of Letos Joker was pretty decent, you could tell they had some really intriguing ideas but the cutting of the film and removal of scenes messed with the portrayal and made it make no sense. 
Even the fact the original plan was for Joker to NOT be romantically involved and be an actual abusive spouse is clearly a sign Ayer knew what he was doing. 

I think the whole fiasco with WB getting involved skewered the film obviously, they really should have left Ayer to it. The planned scenes they cut clearly would have helped not hindered, but I don't blame Ayer for sticking by WB. He had a job to do and he did it and he's not a big enough director to openly oppose them without any backlash. 

I usually rate films by ""Okay"", ""Good"", ""Great"" and ""Amazing"". This film is definitely just okay and it really did have the potential to be a great film. 

Now all my faith is in Patty Jenkins and Wonder Woman, if it sucks (and from what I've seen it shouldn't) I won't be watching Justice League.",4w86a7

**The Bad:**

**Slipknot's introduction** - I know this guy is only here to prove that the bomb implants work, but fuck me, could they have tried any less to bring him in?   He didn't appear until about the 40 minute point, and was giving a throwaway line. 

""Oh yeah, that guy.   Uh.... Slipknot!   That's the one.   ye, he climbs shit or something"". 

And on that note.

**Slipknot** - Not because the character was anything special.   He had something like 4 words to say.   I just feel bad for Adam Beach.   He was probably excited as shit.   ""Fuck yeah, I'm in Suicide Squad.   I know I'm probably gonna die, but I might get a few badass scenes in bef...  What do you mean I'm dead within 10 minutes?""

I'm pretty sure there was an ARGUS Agent who had more to say than he did.

**The Music** - When the trailer gets the music better than the actual movie, you have issues.    Nothing seemed to fit, but fuck it, here's Seven Nation Army!   No wait, now it's Eminem!  Nope, Norman Greenbaum.   Look at us, we know popular songs too!

**The Joker** - Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.   I really wanted to like Leto's run at this, but it was just a huge disappointment.   He never gave me the chills that Ledger's did, never entertained me like Nicholson's, and never had me hooked on his every word like Hamill's.    It's possible that I've been spoiled by 3 incredible runs of the Joker, but honestly, it didn't even begin to feel like Leto ever was him.    

The makeup/tattoos are a well documented issue, so I won't touch on that, despite them being my biggest issue.      Next up is the feel that he's just some crime lord gone loopy.    Black Mask or some shit.    He has his squad of cosplayers shooting people down, but that never felt like something Joker would do.      He'd definitely shoot people, but this felt lazy for him.   There was no funny side, no joke, no nothing in most of the kills.   

His relationship with Quinn was an odd one too.  To me, they've always seemed like a drug addict and her dealer.    Harley is addicted to Joker, and he knows it.   He feeds the addiction, knowing that doing so buys undying loyalty from her.    He drip feeds her just the right amount of love and affection to ensure that she remains with him.  No matter how horrible he acts to her, no matter the amount of abuse he doles out, no matter the words he says or the things he does, she'll always come back to him, looking for that next fix.     In Suicide Squad, he seems...almost too caring towards her.  It's understandable that their relationship might not be one that goes down well in today's society, where there are people who are looking for reasons to be outraged, but if you don't want to properly portray the relationship that has been such a massive part behind a character's creation and success, why bother drawing attention to it at all?

**We some kinda Suicide Sqwaaad?** - ...

**Helicopter Crashes** - Movie Tip #1 Courtesy of /u/Daik07.    If you want to survive a crash in a chopper, just don't be the pilot.   Apparently that makes you invincible. 

**The Enchantress and whats his chops** - Underwhelming doesn't even begin to cover these two.    Boring, poorly acted, boring, shit voice dub, boring and poorly acted.   Did I mention that they were boring?   Oh, and that fucking dancing.  Holy shit, I almost lost it at that point.

**Killer Croc** - A walking talking stereotype.  

**The Editing** - Suffered from the same problems that BvS had.  It was choppy and it felt like entire scenes were missing.

**The Ending Slo-Mo**

This wasn't just a bit much.     This was hitting a home-run and then running the plates bollock naked, cartwheeling after every third step.   For fuck sake, we all knew what was coming, just get it over with.   Will Smith saves the day.   We've seen it before, we'll see it again.

**The Good:**

**Margot Robbie's Arse** - The movie kept drawing attention to it, so I might as well join in.   10/10

**Captain Boomerang** - Fuckin' hell, I didn't see this one coming.   Jai Courtney went full bogan and I loved every second of it.   From his taunting of Diablo to his laughable attempts at romance with Katana, this was by far the best character in the entire movie.    A movie with some of the my favourite villains in comic book history, and Captain fucking Boomerang still managed to steal the show.  

**Harley Quinn** - This was by no means the best Harley that I've seen on screen, but she managed to retain a lot of her charm and wit, despite her other half losing both.    The only real downside to her was the need for her to have the final say in a few of her scenes (namely Katana's Intro), but those were the worst of her lines, so that's still a positive from me.

**Will Smith** - Other than the Suicide Sqwaaaad line, this was a solid performance from Smith.    He was basically just playing himself, but fuck it, Will Smith is cool enough to headline any movie in my eyes.

**The Flash's Cameo** - Fuck yes!  2/2 for solid/good Flash scenes so far.   Even if I'm worried about WB fucking up another DC movie, I'm very excited to see Ezra Miller continue his take on the character.   

**Batfleck** - I regret ever questioning this casting decision.

All in all, Suicide Squad was a disappointment, but there was some shining lights among the darkness.

5/10.    I'll probably re-watch it when it hits the stores, but I have no desire to go back to the cinema to see it.

d64tlio,"Not sure where all the hate is coming from, but I respect that people have different opinions.  I wasn't bored at any point throughout, the characters were entertaining, and the soundtrack was great.  I thought it was a great action flick with good comedic relief.  ",4w86a7
d64vdsy,"Went in with an open mind and ended up incredibly disappointed. I can deal with boring, and I can deal with cliches, but when the entire movie was wrought with ham-fisted dialogue, out-of-character actions, and every superhero cliche imaginable, I just can't do it.

Pros: 

* Margot Robbie was excellent. I'd watch a movie that was just Harley Quinn

* I actually really liked Will Smith too. Funny dialogue, fairly down to earth, and though the kid thing was a bit forced, it overall wasn't too bad.

Cons:

* Absolutely terrible character motivations. ""Hey, I'm good guy generic soldier, and my boss just offed five FBI agents for no particular reason. lol she's just a rapscallion."" ""Hey, the boss lady who's sent us to hell and back is somehow still alive and threatening to kill us. Instead of having Deadshot kill her faster than she can blink, we'll all just go back to prison for shits and giggles""

* Hamfisted dialogue: Okay, we get it. Diablo had a change of heart. You don't need to hit us over the head with it. Subtlety is key. Having him tell us every other line that he regrets what he did and is a changed man now is just poor writing

* Killer Croc had all of five lines, and they were all mid 1990s ebonics. It was as if the studio grabbed the nerdiest intern out there and asked ""Hey, what do black people sound like?"" You wrote Will Smith's character so well, especially the jokes, but you expect us to laugh at the one liner of ""I didn't *axe* a question""

* What was up with the original charge that somehow didn't go off? Sorceress activated the charge and peaced out of there, but everyone was just fine and dandy. Wut happened there

* Generic Soldier Dude was hesitant about having Diablo die when taking down Giant Pharaoh, but he didn't have a second thought about having his soldier detonate it, which would result in immediate death??

* Turns out Generic Soldier Dude has been keeping your daughter's letters from you the entire time. But that's somehow a good thing, so I'll fight for you now. (In his defense, it might be that soldier dude kept them instead of trashing them? But I feel like that could've been more clear)

* where the hell did the navy seals who went with Croc to place the final charge come from? Where did they get the scuba equipment?

* The music scenes, especially the last one, seemed really out of place. Some of them were fine, but the last scene in particular was just really jarring

* Generic Soldier Dude made the sacrifice to kill his lover instead of letting the Sorceress live, but JK THE GIRL IS STILL ALIVE INSIDE, SO HE GETS A HAPPY ENDING BUT NOT ANYONE ELSE

* WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THE SUICIDE SQUAD? The military authorized them in order to presumably take down this threat, but their main job was to rescue evil government lady and do nothing else. Who at the top brass authorized this?",4w86a7

It's hard to fault him for trying too hard, because he obviously felt good about the project, but it just comes across as bad.

Something else that didn't sit quite well with me was that they lost the cool gritty sort of punk feel that they had for like the first 20 minutes of the film, and it just turned into a cliche action film. ",4w86a7

And in the end, Harley had her explosive device deactivated, and yet she's still coerced back into prison by someone threatening something that's no longer supposed to be coercing her?

d67412o,"I'm very half and half on this movie. It does some things good and it does some things bad. 

The good:

•Character development for the most part was pretty good. I really liked these characters and hope they show up again later down the line in other DC movies. However, not without its flaws. Kept getting annoyed by Diablo talking about how this is his new family when they've only been together for a short period of time and especially after he refused to help them in the beginning. 

•Batfleck scenes were rad. Really liking this Batman. He's similar, yet different enough from Bale's Batman that it makes me really interested in him. Don't understand how they're doing a lot of things right with him, but just consistently fucking up in other areas. The end credits scene where he's getting the files from Waller makes me excited for Justice League because it feels like Bruce Wayne is really giving all of his effort to make this happen. 

•The Flash scene was awesome. I'd like to thank the people behind the trailers for not spoiling this. It was an awesome surprise that I didn't see coming, so thank you for that. I did not take this surprise for granted. 

•I liked the idea of living in a post-Superman world. I liked that this movie made it necessary to watch Batman v. Superman. One of my gripes with the Marvel movies is that I put so much time and effort watching their monstrous catalogue and learning about the characters and they're always trying to explain what happened in the previous movies for actions occurring during the new movies. I liked that this movie expected you to just know Superman was ""dead."" 

The whatever: 

•I've just accepted the fact that we're never going to have a Joker as good as Heath Ledger. As stupid as I think the tattoos are on Leto's Joker, I didn't think he was horrible. Nothing to rave about, but far from being one of the problem's with this movie. Interested to see how he's going to interact with Eisenberg's Lex Luthor because I'm pretty sure that's going to inevitably happen at some point. I feel like watching Ben Affleck's Batman beat the living shit out of Leto's Joker would be awesome. Not because I hate the Joker, but because I can see him really fucking with Batman and fighting back or just laughing right in his face when Batman decks him in his.

•Amanda Waller killing all of those people in that room. I already know Amanda Waller is a bad bitch, I watched her kill Slipknot. This scene wasn't a deal breaker, but it felt really unnecessary. 

The bad:

•The pacing. Jesus fucking Christ. It was like I blinked and they were fighting the villain. Let's tear into this villain. 

•Enchantress fucking sucks. One second Amanda Waller is telling them how awesome having Enchantress is on their side and the next second, oh no she's bad! And she has a sidekick! And she's destroying Midway City with her mystical powers! Hey guys, look at her minions! They're just gray blobs! And I'm sitting in the theater, watching this final fight and she pulls their weapons away. Also, why couldn't she just do that from the get go? Anyway, I'm thinking in my head ""I swear to god. If she mentions something about how skilled they are and they should just join her I'm going to be pissed."" And sure enough, ""you are greatest skilled warriors I have ever faced, join me."" Seriously? Are you being serious? What a fucking cop out. And her relationship with Rick Flag was hazy and weird. (I'm forgetting her name, the one who was just used for Enchantress' body) 

Those are really my only two dislikes, but they really impacted how I felt about this movie. 

Conclusion:

You're going to want to see Suicide Squad if you're already invested in this DC Cinematic Universe, but if I were you, I'd just wait for the rental. You really only have to see it because it's in the DCCU, not because it's a great movie. The movie does a few things right, but ultimately does a lot of wrong. I hope to see these characters come back because they weren't what was wrong with the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed Will Smith as Deadshot and would like to see him again. 5/10 film. ",4w86a7

d67xygj,"Actually I was just thinking about the movie again and wanted to clarify one thing- what was the teams actual mission at the start- stop Enchantress or save Waller? I got some mixed messages.

If it was to save Waller, the team that was selected makes a bit more sense, because other then Diablo and maybe Katana with her magic sword, I don't think any one else on the team stood a chance against Enchantress and her brother. Even Slipknot made some sense as they had to get to the top of the building to get to Waller. Also the fact that they initially tried to avoid fighting the creatures and also when Waller had gotten aboard the chopper, she was going to send another to extract the rest of the team, so that would mean their mission is over.

But if that's the case...then what was the actual plan to stop Enchantress? The Squad only attacks her because they have to save Waller, and again the only things that were effective against the villains was Diablo's powers (which based on one line of dialogue seemed like might be magic based?) and Katana's sword. So it doesn't make sense to send them to try and stop god like beings. But I don't recall any dialogue saying there was any other plan to stop them. So were they also actually expected to fight and stop Enchantress and her brother?",4w86a7

The Joker would NEVER go to that great of lengths just for Harley... NEVER. The Joker is a smart man who understands Harley's usefulness and therefore shows her just enough affection so she stays around, but also treats her like shit with the insults and occasional backhand... he does not love her.

Like BvS, it wasn't terrible, but it certainly wasn't great. What is it with Hollywood and their inability to give a film a simple structure? This movie was all over the place. The pacing was so up and down and the editing was atrocious. The villain was wank and i really didn't give a shit about many of the characters, save for deadshot and harley. 

I loved how people, including myself, watched the trailers and though ""Hey, it's good that they're not showing off who the villain is, or what is actually going off"" and now I know why,  because I don't think the creators had any idea either.

And the fucking exposition and the music. Cringeworthy explanation, and the songs which don't complement a scene at all.

And don't get me started on the needless high stakes. Fuck, a handgun sniper, a boomerang thrower, a guy who climbs anything(?), a crazy person are the ones you pick to fight a power which destroyed a city and later on, a sattelite? FFS, call batman's team.

Also, fuck that joker. Looked like a generic gangsta who wears makeup for his Instagram followers. Enchantress looked like a joke too, with her hula dancing and weird expressions. The fake craziness in Harley and Joker was embarrassing.

d683asf,"::SPOILERS::: 

Huge issues with this movie. 

By far the worst; the main villains are ""destroying the world"" yet they are easily killed by a ""demo charge"" that a person can swim into position. Where does this scuba gear even come from? and .... seriously? swimming a bomb into position under the enemy? WTF kind of plan is that?

Why not hit with massive flights of JDAM bombs? Precision munitions? A10 strafing runs with depleted uranium gattling guns? Howitzer shots? or just ""a tank""? 

Next, who or what shot down their fucking helicopter? They are flying in, get SHOT DOWN, its never explained why or what did that, and you never see enemies with guns ever 

Next - they pick up the chick, her helicopter just shoots all it's anti heat seeking missile flares? why? What was that ? No explanation, but they fly right near the enemy on the ground. AFTER, instead of just flying UP. what?

Also the whole ""Suicide squad"" didn't have any actual assholes on it? They all turned out to be great folks who band together and fucking fall in love with each other while saving the indigenous people of the rainforest or some shit? I thought they were supposed to be bad guys, but they are INSTANTLY all just good guys. 

Next the most chiche' ""bad guy"" of all time, the evil woman running them shoots her subordinates, comments on how the world killing evil villains makes the perfect mindless soldiers and wants to co-op that somehow? It's always ridiculously dumb when the bad guys are literally ""I will state my evil intentions"" type bad guys. Real world bad guys have at least the delusion of righteousness. 

ALSO - the whole ""we have an app that blows up your head, we just need to activate our phone, find your picture, and click on you"" is unbelievably stupid. There is no central command on these missions? NO one watching who could do that FOR you? OR when the joker hijacks your helicopter, could have warned you of that in advance? No? Alright... that doesn't make much sense. 

Quinn warns the bad guy multiple times right before betraying her. The same bad guy that can ""run"" to Tehran and back in 2 seconds, without her heart. Ok?

And they did all this cool design work for enchantress, she was sweet in the first half, but then she turns into ""generic CGI shit fest"" who is apparently completely powerless and impotent for the climax?

Katana had a cool sword instead of a personality. Killer croc was just a crocodile guy that sounded like a new york gang banger. Boomerang was generic comic relief. Slipknot died almost immediately after he was introduced. El Diablo had a dumb generic background story and he inexplicably says that the squad is his ""family"" at the end. Enchantress looked and acted like a girl rolling on MDMA at coachella, she also sounded bizarre. And the final villain was just doomsday 2.0. The only reason people say the characters are interesting is because they are familiar with them. If they knew nothing about the DC comics then they would think they were boring.

d660f2q,"You know what? I enjoyed my time watching Suicide Squad. But if you are like me and you wanted the film to not just be brainless fun and more of a solid movie, you are probably disappointed.

The moment I first started to understand negative reviews was merely around 3 minutes into the movie. A weird Instagram filtered flashback of Harley Quinn strapped to a chair burst onto my screen and I was so confused. But what was next?? A video game card introduction for Deadshot, fit with descriptions all about his character. I am not joking. I am dead serious. It was literally like the promotion for the movie jumped up onto the screen. But this happened for not one, but ALL characters. So instead of properly teaching me about these characters and how they came about and letting the movie breathe, I was treated with FLASHCARDS on descriptions of these characters. Literally WHAT does that have to do in context with the film?? NOTHING. It is just in context with the promotion of the movie, meaning it DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

Jared Leto's Joker was nice. What was not nice was his relationship with Harley Quinn. BRUSHED OVER. Not explained. Simply told to us quickly. I don't see why Harley would fall in love with this man. I was TOLD that she did via VOICEOVER. Literally WHAT IS THIS MESS? This relationship was absolutely slaughtered. I am certain there was lots of improv cut from the movie, and even if it was bad, they should have kept it in. Why? Because scenes were not scenes. Scenes were reduced to short CLIPS, GLIMPSES of what possibly could have been beautiful storytelling.

I am frustrated with the first 40 minutes of this movie. From then on, it improves with some action, but of course, we do not get to see much shining from characters here. What was the action? Shooting guns. That's it. I never thought I'd ever say this, but I am: I actually wanted EXPLOSIONS in this movie. The characters did not show enough personality, creativity or uniqueness during the action. Spice Harley up! Let her bounce off the walls with her gymnastic abilities! Let Katana go wild with her sword!

Why were the cast able to do lots of their stunts? Because there are barely any stunts. Harley Quinn running up the walls and across the roof of an elevator was the most impressive stunt in this movie. There is a lack of danger, quickly introducing the creepy minions, but soon brushing over them. Instead of the disturbing brainwashed aliens that they were when first introduced, they simply become punching bags. While it was fun and chaotic, it was lacking any sort of suspense. Who cared what was going to happen next? I knew they were just going to take down the minions and move to the next location.

Characters like Katana and the crocodile guy, what's the point? They were both awesome, but both heavily underused. Heck, the least they could have done was done even A LITTLE BIT with Slipknot before they blew his head off in an anti-climactic manner.

Enchantress, no. She was pretty cool in her first form but - once again - bad story structure and pacing made her an underwhelming villain. In her second form, ridiculous. Maybe I would have appreciated her jellyfish wobbling more if A. they didn't plop some random bimbo's voice over Cara's, B. covered Cara's face more to hide her weak acting expressions and C. made her more evil. However, I did like the silhouette shots we got of her witch form being shadowy in the light. Her weird minotaur looking minion? No. Just no. He looked like he was ripped out of Percy Jackson.

Who is the focus on? Deadshot? Harley? Joker? They should have picked Harley and Joker and ran with it. Of course, despite Will Smith's good performance and line delivery, he requires the most attention. In consequence, the crammed plot suffered.

My final complaint: editing. Oh boy... The editing team is in deep trouble. I'm not even going to go into specifics, but all I'm going to say is that I was frowning a lot after certain shots. 

I sound so pissed, right? Yeah, because I'm frustrated that this movie was rushed and not as good as it could have been. Even underneath all the mess, you have a fun decent action movie. Set the bar very low going in and do not take the movie seriously. You will probably enjoy your time.

Also, the 3D: kind of underutilized. The only parts in the movie that are honestly great in 3D are literally one or two shots of the minions being smashed apart and flying off the screen. Not to mention that it darkens the movie a lot and it became particularly hard to see what was happening during some of the action. Watch in standard 2D. 

Rant over.

5.5/10.

TL;DR: Poor editing, messy script, Harley and Joker origin story should have been developed more, other origins should have been kept for another movie or characters should have been completely gone, fun but basic action, mediocre rental movie.",4w86a7
d65d9wu,"The criticisms I heard were too kind.  The actors did do a good job with what they were given (except Joel Kinnaman and Cara Delevingne), but the dialogue was embarrassing.  This movie was starring the 'villains', so you would expect the actual antagonist to have a better plot than this jumble over every bad guy plan from the last 20 years.  They got in the giant CGI magic clouds, faceless henchmen, ancient evil power, and control of government satellites.  It was like going through a checklist.  

The original cut of the movie may have been much better about them bonding as a team.  Boomerang immediately gets one of them killed just to test if the neck bombs worked.  Croc has no interactions with anyone.  Harley tells Diablo he actually is a piece of shit.  In one scene, Diablo calls them his family and makes a sacrifice play.  And Deadshot blows a bomb under him with no hesitation.  

They never explained why Katana was there.  Why she was so loyal to Waller and Flag.  Why she goes into the bar instead of going with the seals.  ",4w86a7
d65lopb,"- I wish all the trailer scenes would have not been in the movie. It seriously spoiled the whole thing. Especially in the case of this movie, the objective is less important than how they get there. If they needed/wanted to spoil something, it should have been the team's goal. Not how they get there and what they do along the way. At the very least, shoot new footage just for the trailer if you want to advertise the tone.

- Katana, Boomerang and a few others were not needed. I don't care if it goes against the comic (I don't know, not a comic person). Add them later to the team. The movie was overcrowded and many characters felt useless. Croc was only slightly better. He felt underutilized and underpowered. You would have figured he'd mop the floor with the underwater fight scenes. Speaking of which. Why does he not have a tail? How can he swim fast if he has no means of propulsion?

- I felt the super powers of many were ill explained which made them look widely uneven. Harley felt kind of useless/underpowered in that sense. Enchantress and her bro looked brutal initially, but looked nerfed vs the good guys. 

- I expected some kind of twist with Katana's sword being the only thing capable of ""sealing"" the bro and sis. Instead explosives. Lame. Why the hell include her then? Why not drop a bomb on the bad guy area?

- For someone who can pull off incredible and impossible shots, Deadshot felt like a costume wearing Flag with cool gear. No single bullet multikills, no ricochet kills, no special weapons.

- Diablo learned ancient Aztec in the hood apparently?

- Apparently you need to fall into a pool of make-up removing acid to learn how to be an elite hand-to hand fighter?

- Generic, faceless bad guy fodder. Meh. Strong enough to subdue special force operators, but no match for a 100 pound chick in plateform heels with a baseball bat.

- The intro for every character was interesting, but unnecessary to the plot. They should have made a movie about ""assembling(capturing) the Suicide Squad"" that would have covered their origin story. This movie should have presented us with familiar characters and started the story with the capture and turn of the enchantress, the ""crown jewel"" of Waller's Suicide Squad, gone wrong.

- The whole Joker gangbanger thing was interesting, but in a world where batman is a total beast it kind of makes no sense. I got the feeling that Batman would mop the floor with him. He did not look ""smart"" enough to give trouble to batfleck. Rambo Joker as a killer/tough guy makes no sense. He's a schemer. He misdirects and plots. Why is he leading hit squads? They should have only shown him as ""training/torturing/creating"" Harley. Not as some kind of ghetto wildcard that can apparently unravel a super secret organisation (and the suicide squad control mechanism) within a few hours.

- The visuals and soundtrack were fun. An upbeat Sucker Punch.

- The lack of adult language and humor seriously crippled it. Not all DC/Marvel action comedy movies need to be Deadpool, but this movie should have been much funnier and a movie about bad guys should have been much more crude and vulgar. It felt castrated. Harley's ""turn to the darkside"" felt very PG.

- So much cringey dialogue.

- Amanda Waller was legit terrifying just after she got rescued. I wish they would have showcased that more (have her off a member for something silly instead of punishing an escape attempt). Maybe have them start off with more recruits and, over the course of brutal exercises and tests, have her kill off those that fail.",4w86a7

The main story, characters and concept have potential. That's undeniable. But the execution is completly off on several levels, mostly in the editing, which is bad enough to have butchered the movie even if the script was brilliant (which it wasn't)

It's simply a broken trainwreck, and as a movie lover, and cinephile i cannot ignore the problems even if i wanted to. It simply made no sense, even moreso than Batman v Superman.

Maybe an extended cut with a completely different story can bring it back from terrible to okay.
To fix:

- The main characters need more time to be introduced (and not as sloppy as it was edited now)
- Joker needs time to breathe, display how he works, thinks. Every single scene with him was too short/choppy. So much cut footage to bring back.

- Joker/Harley relationship was changed in the editing. Make up your mind. Fix this shit.

- Enchantress scenes / background was told super messy and made very little sense. Can be 
reworked. Her turn and subway scene was very unclear.

- Remove the crappy trailer editing character intro's.

- The final fight scene was butchered and made very little sense (Diablo's final form where the hell did that come from? Probably another scene that was cut)

- DONT PUT POP MUSIC IN EVERY SINGLE FUCKING SCENE. smh.

d64udt6,"Just came back from watching it. This has got to be the absolute, most depressing ""Superhero"" movie I have ever seen. Magnolia, a two hour long movie that's nothing but people crying isn't as sad as Suicide Squad. To be honest, I thought the first act was okay, but they crammed too much soundtrack, as if they were trying to one-up Guardians of the Galaxy. As for the 2nd half of the movie, all the energy and style of the first chunk dies, and instead of having a misfit adventure, we're left with a rainy, dark, disjointed collection of love stories where everyone cries.

Also, am I the only one that thought the Suicide Squad was completely meaningless in their own movie? Deadshot just shoots people, but there was a whole squad of soldiers, so he was just one among them, so he didn't really do much of anything but shoot more guns. Harley Quinn seriously didn't do anything but be cute, but her being there jeopardized the mission with the Joker coming back for her, so she didn't really do anything. Killer Croc didn't do anything until he was needed to traverse the sewers, but we never really saw him until he came back, and the other army men had air breathers, so he was unnecessary. The only guy that actually did anything/everything was Diablo. ",4w86a7

d64x2h2,"Overall I thought it was a solid movie I mean it's not perfect by a long shot but it wasn't terrible. My expectations were met. It felt like the animated movie Assault on Arkham but a little longer. The movie was a fun movie and that's all I wanted. The only gripes I have is that some of the dialogue towards the end was a little cheesy, there's a bit of a tonal shift in the movie towards the last half that's a little strange but it doesn't throw the movie off and Joker isn't in it that much that's the only gripes I have. Jared Leto was cool as the joker I want to see more of him, and apparently there is a bunch of deleted scenes that they left out of the movie with him so I'm deff getting the blu-ray. Will Smith was great, Harley Quinn was great. Out of 5 stars maybe I'll give it like a 3.5/5",4w86a7
d64xidg,"The movie wasn't great but I think it was still worth seeing. The director was very inefficient at mapping the plot, in a way I can't even explain...the plot got sooo much screen time but still felt ridiculously under developed.

It had the potential to pioneer DC movies into this new generation of movies. I didn't like the idea of the antagonist being Enchantress with her ""brother"", it felt like the generic monsters we see in movies like BVS, in my opinion.

d65kz09,"I just got out of a morning showing. Overall it is meh. Poor execution and poor choice of antagonist drag this down to a level below the theatrical cut of Batman v. Superman.

The positives are the casting was solid. Waller reminded me of the timmverse version in her tone and in her demeanor. Margin Robbie did great as Harley, the trailers really don't show it but she does have the harley's accent just toned down somewhat. I loved the easter eggs especially in Harley's background and the wardrobes looked good. The appearance of Flash and Batman had an appropriate amount of screen presence and I really really hope don't fuck up Justice League.

Problem is there are a lot of negatives. Enchantress and her army of asphalt soldiers feels very generic plot wise. (CinemaSins and Screen Junkies are going to have a field day). Enchantress's brother looks like a discount version of the Annihilator from Thor. Waller had one scene which felt out of place where she straight murders government agents. Waller plays dirty, but at the end of the day everything she does is to help the USA, so shooting agents on your side felt out of character. Unlike Heath or Ben, Jared Leto's performance was not a home run that would silence critics. I found the Tattoos overkill still and plot wise, he wasn't needed. His part could have been cut out for all except Harley's origin and the movie would have moved along like it did. I also didn't like how he actually cared for Harley. It felt very Un Joker like. At most Harley is an amusing plaything for him that he would discard the moment she becomes inconvenient.  That said, I did like the street gangster take on him. Had he been the main antagonist rather then enchantress, I think that would have made a very compelling movie compared to what we saw.

Overall, I'm not buying when its on blu ray unless it's part of a bundle or bargain bin cheap. 5.5/10",4w86a7

d65w4wn,"This movie was like watching someone dream. Rich Evans made the joke about a script getting thrown around and messed up before being shot on Best of The Worst and this film kinda feels like that. Plot threads fall in and out of the the movie. Characters are pointless. Will smith plays Will Smith. The ""serious"" parts were so hilariously poorly shot it made for comedic gold. The action was boring. The plot was stupid. The end battle was a parody. But, it just gets over that barrier to be ""So bad its good"" for me.

Also, why does suicide squad even exist? Like, in the movie, nothing that anyone in the squad did couldnt be done by a trained like Spec Ops person. Like, half of them dont even have real powers. Harley is just crazy, Will Smith is a good shot, Killer Croc is...Strong?, Boomerang throws good and katana can use a sword. They are no more useful in the movie then the non-super hero guy. I mean, Diablo legitimately is like the most OP guy in the whole movie, but  that just makes you wonder why they didn't just get him to go in. All Smith had to do to break him out of his pacifist phase was egg him on for like three seconds. And then people in the squad are all like ""I lost one family I won't lose another"". WTF! YOU'VE KNOW EACH OTHER FOR LIKE 4 HOURS. Im sure if I read every Suicide Squad comic or watched the 15 hour director's cut this shit would make more sense, but IMO you need to edit your movie so anyone can understand what is happening to a reasonable extent. Like, look at Lord of The Ring. They threw so many references to the Similirialan and shit all over the place. Like how Gandalf wears that one ring of power or how Gilmli get the three strands of hair and stuff. BUT me as a 6 year old could watch the movie and understand what is happening.  ",4w86a7

I wanted to enjoy this movie more, but that being the central plot is a huge 'why should I give a shit?' I was bored out of my mind when they did the same thing in Avengers 2, and I was very bored with it here.  However I enjoyed a lot of the Suicide Squad's little character moments. I just wish we had these characters in a more interesting story.",4w86a7

d6686je,"The movie felt very videogame-like. The scene where they spy on Enchantress' minions from the distance up until the part where the minions start leaping over cars and chasing, it was like a videogame cutscene which was then followed by gameplay.

It had that whole vibe, especially with them going through the streets to that building. The final fight, literal videogame. It was like they were trapped by invisible walls when fighting Enchantress. Not to mention, she literally looked like a videogame boss! Even her Percy Jackson minotaur brother!

d66f1fy,"Positives:

1) The movie is fun and there are genuine moments where I couldn't help but laugh

2) The characters are likeable

3) Me and my friends like the Joker

Negatives :

1) I can pinpoint where this movie went down hill for me and it's right after the seven nation army song. That's where things just happened. Like I couldn't care about anything that was happening to anybody. The action just was pointless. Then it happened again in the office building. It just got repetitive.

2) Even if I like the characters, Its like I never even watched the movie. I came out with the same feeling that I went in with.

Katana was just there, Croc was just there, Boomerang was just the comic relief who from the reviews I thought I was going to like but I just didn't. El Diablo was the only meta human that I was beginning to kind of care about. Then he died. Do you know what I did? I shrugged...I didn't care that he died. It's frustrating how much I don't care about anything in this movie because the ride is fun but once I got off I just felt nothing.

3) The villian and the whole final fight and the slow motion. Just just..I laughed at it all. It was too much pointless crap.

4) We don't like the jokers laugh....at all

I don't even want to rate this movie because I could care less..It's like I didn't even see a movie. I just saw stuff happen.

I've NEVER been this frustrated with a movie",4w86a7
d66gd3m,Everything that Harley Quinn did that was interesting was spoiled in the trailer.,4w86a7
d66gq5y,It wasn't bad but it wasn't great.  Waiting for the inevitable directors cut that will hopefully flesh out this movie.  Not a fan of Leto's Joker.  Thought everyone else was pretty good.  Needed more boomerang.  Felt they missed a big comic opportunity by not giving him a scene where the enchantress is promising them the life they want. ,4w86a7
d66hqpn,"Biggest disappointment for me was the bat man cameo. That fight with dead shot had so much potential to be a cool little thing-- even if it was super brief-- but that choreography was awful. The editing for that fight made me cringe hard, especially after seeing the BVS scene where he clears the room out. It was garbage compared to that, and it could've been a really awesome scene. 

Also, I got really mad when dead shot happened to read all of the important info out of that *thick as fuck* binder in less than 30 seconds, citing it like he'd just spent a couple hours going through it with some ""you need to tell us all the truth"" and that yeah, he saw the romance thing. That was fucking retarded. 

EDIT: 

And because I just remember I hated this, too; wasn't Harley supposed to be the one who gave the joker his tats? I remember not liking them when I first saw them, then being like ""oh, yeah ok. I guess I see that."" He was tatted up before he even turned her into Harley... Which would mean she didn't do it. Which makes me think the tattoos are stupid. ",4w86a7
d66izoa,"This film just didn't hit the areas that it should have done. It feels like it was just an awesome idea and nothing more. The writing in this film is appalling and nearly all of the jokes miss their marks. Will Smith as Deadshot, Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, Ben Affleck as Batman and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn are standout performers, the others just seem to be sort of cannon-fodder and don't really add much to the film. El Diablo seemed like a really interesting three dimensional character in the beginning and ended up as a walking cliche with dialogue to match. For a film that spoke about Jared Leto's Joker a lot, it seems weird that he's not in it more, that being said, for me, the jury is still out on his Joker, I'm not sure if he's not very good as The Joker or if he's just not given anywhere near enough screen time to sufficiently flesh the character out, the design for the character doesn't really seem that interesting either, it seems like the design for The Joker, the film and the writing and directing of many of the scenes seems to be ""That'd be cool, let's do that and we'll worry about the logic of it later"". Also, the editing in this film is a joke, scenes have clearly been cut which give more depth to the scenes and explain why things happen, such as Jai Courtney's funny departure, only to reappear without explanation in the proceeding scene. The story seems incredibly weak and the motivations and reasons why people do things are equally weird. As a huge DC fan and someone who has read his fair share of comics over the years it's become very clear after ""Man of Steel"", ""Batman vs. Superman"" and now ""Suicide Squad"" that DC really do need to step things up in my opinion.

d66k2ie,I thought it was the best and certainly most expensive episode of The Flash to date.,4w86a7
d66kmu1,"Overall I'd say the film was completely average. It's in the same category as X-Men: Apocalypse in that it's not bad but not good.

The one thing that really annoyed me about the movie was how much I hated the Joker. He isn't so much the Joker as much as he's just a gang leader who looks like the Joker. He's ""eccentricities"" really just equate to him laughing like the Joker. Also try as I might, I couldn't get past how fucking stupid he looks. The tattoos are very noticeable and not in a good way and the metal teeth really bothered me more than I thought it would. I understand the realistic reason for why he would have metal teeth but I thought they looked really dumb.",4w86a7
d66l74g,"Too me my dissapointment stems from one thing more than any. Jared Leto as the Joker was a HUGE advertisment/selling point for this movie. He is on screen for about 10 minutes. I liked him as the Joker but I wanted more. From what I have read they have cut upwards of an hour of Joker footage so I will be watching the director's cut. Hopefully with the ending we will see a stand alone batman movie with Leto as the villain.

Also I thought this movie was supposed to take place LONG before Batman v. SUperman. It didn't appear too. The only thing that made it seem long before Batman V. Superman was that he wasn't as tiredsome/ruthless as he was in it. THe end credit scene made it seem post Batman V. Superman though.

Terrible protrayal of Deadshot. Not WIll Smith's acting but the character was poorly written/poor comparison to the comic book version.",4w86a7
d66vse4,"Just got back home from seeing it. For me, its definitely not as bad as critics are saying, it was quite enjoyable. And I think a good portion of the audience agreed, evidenced by some laugh out loud scenes and applause at the end.

Harley stole the show for sure.

d66w1po,"Haven't seen it yet but one thing I've noticed about comic book movies is that the less ""into"" the character you are the more likely you are to enjoy the movie. I've never read a comic book in my life, most of my experience with superheroes came from Spiderman and Batman cartoons when I was little. Consequently I enjoy most super hero movies.

I have an acquaintance that has read a lot of comics and he seems to hate every single super hero movie that comes out. Except for Deadpool, he like Deadpool. But for the movies he doesn't like he complains that they're nothing like the comics and so he can't seem to enjoy them. I argue that it'd be pretty boring to see a film if you already knew what was going to happen in the movie but oh well.
",4w86a7
d66xeuy,"I enjoyed it.  Like others here have said, I don't see why so many critics gave it an unfavorable rating.  Was it flawed?  Sure.  But it was entertaining and well worth the price of a ticket, in my opinion.

**The Good**

* Every character was distinct and had an opportunity to shine, even if that opportunity was short.  Deadshot is almost a C-list character, but with Will Smith he became a convincing lead.  Harley Quinn was good.  El Diablo was surprisingly important and had a really bad ass moment at the end.  Boomerang, Katana, and Croc also pulled their weight.
* Quality acting.  At the very least, the performances were better than what I expect from a comic book movie.
* The movie was definitely much more fun than *Batman v Superman*.  It was a much-needed departure from that bleak tone.
* The conflict was handled in a clever manner.  You would think that a bunch of super-powered sociopaths would be constantly bickering; but nope.  They all realized that their biggest threat was Waller and Enchantress, so they worked together to try and get away from them.  In the end, these supervillains had what I thought to be a believable comraderie.
* Warner Bros. did a really good job at keeping the main villain a secret.  All this time, I thought the big bad was going to be the Tattooed Man.  Nope, it was Enchantress and the really obscure Incubus threatening the world.  In this day and age, when you can stumble upon a major *Star Wars: Rogue One* spoiler just by watching a recent interview, the fact that WB kept SS's villain secret all this time is impressive.
* Slipknot was hilariously worthless.

**The Bad**

* The soundtrack was a bit of a mess.  It felt as though every other scene had a modern pop / hip hop / rock song blaring over the action.  It really made me appreciate the use of music in *Guardians of the Galaxy* even more, because GoTG's soundtrack enhanced those scenes, whereas SS' soundtrack was a bit of a distraction.
* There was no build-up.  The movie spent the first 20 minutes introducing each member of the Squad, and then *boom*, they're off on their suicide mission.  Usually there's a training exercise, an intermediate mission, or *something* before the main mission, but here they went from intro directly to climax.
* The way that Enchantress got defeated was kinda dumb.

Overall, I liked it despite its flaws.  ",4w86a7
d674ind,"I think the film would've benefited from being more focused on the Joker and Harley. I really enjoyed Will Smith's Deadshot - actually enjoyed him being in a good role, in a (mostly) good movie. So if the plot had revolved around exploring Harley's relationship with the Joker, and somehow getting Deadshot in there (hired by the Joker?) it would've been better, in my opinion.

The trailers made it look like the Squad was going to do some cleaning up of other criminals in Gotham/Midway City. Did it have to be some all-encompassing Earth-destroying power and faceless goons like every other comic book movie of late? I'm getting sick of the stakes being *so high* - I assumed a bunch of DC criminals would be given something a little more grounded on their first time out. ",4w86a7

d67de4r,"I found the movie enjoyable, it was average. The editing definitely could've been better, but overall the movie wasn't downright terrible. Character wise, Will Smith and Margot Robbie were fantastic as Deadshot and Harley Quinn, as were El Diablo and Captain Boomerang (this was the first time I saw Jai Courtney in a movie and didn't want him to die). Kinda wish they did a little bit more with Killer Croc though, he really just had a couple lines and punched some stuff. I'm not in love with Jared Leto's Joker, but I'd be interested in seeing him go head to head with Batman. 

Plot wise, it could've been somewhat better. I like Cara Delevingne and all, but really, Enchantress didn't really work with the film. She felt underdeveloped. Like if they showed a scene at the beginning of the movie with her and her brother being sealed away, then that would've been somewhat better. Another thing, I feel like Katana came out of no where, they clearly cut a scene where she was invited to join the squad, which is disappointing. Also, Joker's overall role in the film was interesting. Not what I expected at all. Not completely a fan of how they portrayed the Joker/Harley relationship (I mean I don't like abusive relationships, but this definitely needed to be an abusive relationship), but at the same time, if/when we do get a Batman solo movie, having Joker and Harley be in it together would be nice to see. Then they can flesh out the Joker, flesh out their relationship (and show it how it's supposed to be). 

But I definitely loved the Batman and Flash cameos in the movie. Overall, it was decent. Could've been better, but could've been a lot worse.",4w86a7

d67gtv3,"I just saw it, I different I didn't hate it but didn't like it either, it was just meh. My least favorite parts of the movie was the Joker Harley relationship, I was hoping they would play up how dysfunctional their relationship is. People have been saying how great the characterization was and I just felt it was all over the place, for example when Boomerang left at the bar scene was IMO a great character moment and true to the comics I was so disappointed that he came back. Maybe having a team of truly unreadamable people wouldn't have sit well with mainstream audiences but that's what I wanted. I don't want to trash Let's Joker because I know a lot of his scenes were cut out of the movie even his laugh which sounded great in some of the trailers felt neutered here. Enchantress should not have been the villain IMO, the Suicide Squad isn't who you call to save the world, there supposed to be a black ops unit used for when the government wants plausible deniablity, they should be doing secret, off the books, CIA-TYPE missions. I won't get into the technical stuff but there were a lot of weird moments like when Slipknot dies or Deadshot shouts ""You are evil!"" to Enchantress, just felt out of place.",4w86a7

I haven't read or experienced the source material but it's clear that they did a *very* bad job in their eyes.  One of them wasn't even fully acquainted with DC and was still disappointed by how the film was put together.  Another was a huge mega fan and defended Batman v Superman when it was released, for this film he said it disappointed him.

I thought the film was alright but I'm a filthy casual who hasn't seen the best of the best in which movies can offer so what do I know.

Their criticisms about the movie were valid and I can't argue with them about it.  Knowing that there were two different versions of the film - one edited in David Ayer's version and the studio's version.  I would've preferred to see Ayer's version more since the theatrical version was the studio's editing.

What I disliked about the film was the song choices, they felt out of place and unneeded.  I enjoy the idea of seeing dark scenes having an up and peppy soundtrack to bring out a different tone but this was clearly not the intention from the edit at all.  Also the editing was really bad, in my opinion.  There were moments where it cuts away too fast, unnecessary effects, missing scenes, etc.  

Also during the first encounter with Enchantresses minions, Deadshot killing all the minions by himself made me instantly think of the Overwatch Play of the Game meme.  I would love to see that type of edit lol.",4w86a7

There was a good movie here at one point. I can't believe David Ayer would go for a plot like this even for the money. I could see his influence in the team dynamics and he clearly had a lot of fun with the Joker and wanted more (like everyone else in the audience), but the Enchantress plotline was just phoned the fuck in. 

It's not F4 bad, but it reminded me of it in the sense that what we saw on screen is clearly the result of two factions pulling in different directions. It was like they just stuck two different movies together in post and got some guy in the office to throw on his favourite songs. ",4w86a7

9.  We somehow managed to get multiple origins for several characters. Just pick one. Show Waller putting the team together in response to a threat. Don't tell me she had an idea, then give me the origin, then put the team together to show their skills. Presentation was a mess. 

10. It tried really, really hard to be Guardians of the Galaxy, but wasn't even close. The musical accompaniment didn't even approach it. 

Just as big a mess as Batman v Superman. ",4w86a7
d66owbh,"Well, my popcorn was good. The theater I go to can be a little hit-or-miss with the popcorn to be honest, but they were on point last night.

As far as the movie, I've already forgotten most of it. There was a lot of shooting, I think? It was kind of hard to tell what was going on. Will Smith was there, and Captain Boomerang was played by Tom Hardy's cousin, and Olivia Munn's ex-boyfriend was a colonel (which is weird because he's like 30 years old), and some other guys are there but they all die and/or are irrelevant. Anyway, there was this really bad actress who was a sorceress of Tzeentch or something, and she was apparently Olivia Munn's ex-boyfriend's ex-girlfriend (which makes me wonder why they didn't get Olivia Munn to play her, but whatever) and she opens a portal to the Warp, I guess? It's supposed to be really scary, but Will Smith shoots it and it collapses, so I guess it wasn't really that big of a deal. A bunch of other loud things happened too, but I don't really remember them. Some asshole's cellphone with random pop music songs as ringtones kept going off. 

Oh, and Ben Batfleck and Barry Allen show up for like 5 seconds, and there's a picture of Jason Momosa, and some Hot Topic employee with his ""edgy version of the Joker"" costume kept wandering in and out of the movie for some reason. 

The star of the movie was Margo Robbie's ass jiggle, and it was really the only highlight. The movie was kind of like wandering around an unfamiliar house in the dark, occasionally cracking your shin on some unseen piece of furniture, and every now and then Margot Robbie's jiggling ass pops up for a second to make you feel better, and then it's back to the dark. Except not really that fun.

d67mi2t,"The biggest gripe I have about this movie was that it was a bunch of scenes that are ok or decent (barring some bad writing) tied together with an incoherent story thread that makes no sense at all.

Like for example, suddenly the whole cast are all buddy buddies (Harley's ""You hurt my friends!"" and Diablo's ""I won't lose another family!"" lines) and it's like we missed the whole bonding part. Just felt out of nowhere.

And if Harley had her bomb disarmed by the Joker then why was she still hanging around? I get that she thought the Joker died but is that a reason to just keep going marching towards a probable death? That is a bit of a stretch, or they should have shown her actually developing bonds with the team.

Half of the team felt like they had no character development at all. In particular, Croc felt like the writers couldn't decide what they wanted him to do.

And how the hell does Enchantress get sliced open by Harley at the end there? It felt like they only did that so Harley could have done something in the last fight. Enchantress was dodging everything teleporting around and being untouchable and she gets hit by a sword slash? Hell why did she even stop teleporting in the first place?!

There's a lot of things that I felt were like ""oh ok it's like this then"" that could have used a quick 5 second explanation or scene to explain some things. Even showing (before they fight 50 of them) the henchmen being turned into henchmen by Enchantress and her brother would have explained a lot and not left the audience wondering wtf those things were. I thought they were actually thugs looting the city at first. Another example of this is the military guy Katana came with. I wasn't sure who he was and it felt like he commanded as much respect as Flag but they didn't even introduce him at all. Speaking of which, why is Katana even in this movie? It doesn't make any sense to me.

There were quite a lot of funny scenes and moments, and those intros were damn cool (made 3d worth it in my opinion), but there was a lack of character motivation and development as well as a lack of proper storytelling that made the movie feel disconnected and rushed.",4w86a7

d6502el,The movie was actually semi-watchable...then the third act happened. ,4w86a7
d65v5hx,"Really disappointed, I went in expecting nothing more than a high energy action flick and still left disappointed. 

The enemies were as generic as they come. Barely humanoid generic black clay monsters that suffer from [Conservation of Ninjitsu](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu) and lack any threat at all. 

Too many characters. You could have completely edited Killer Croc, Captain Boomerang and Katana out of the film entirely and you wouldn't have lost a single worthy moment of story line. Also, the guy who owed gambling money to Joker and supposedly lead him to Harley...what happened to him? They set up that character to take a fall, then never showed it.

Joker. Jared Leto was trying SOOOOOOOOO hard, it actually was painful to watch. The writer/director completely fucked the entire Joker/Harley relationship. Joker doesn't care about Harley, she's a tool he uses to commit mayhem, but in this, they're Bonnie and Clyde. Joker's final ""Let's go home"" should have been ""Let's have some fun"". Their relationship should be entirely one-sided, but it's not in this mess of a script. 

Enchantress. Her entire performance just made me think that they kept telling the actor ""Listen, in this scene, you're floating above the ground on a wisp of mist"", then they forgot to cgi the flying part. She looks like a drunk ballerina 90% of the film. Unlimited power? Sure. The ability to walk a straight line? NOPE! 

So Enchantress can be controlled by whoever has her heart, and she can pass through space and time instantly, yet can't seem to make it across a 20 foot room before Waller pulls out a Bic pen and starts shanking her heart in a box? She can't teleport the box? She can't just blast everyone in the room and walk out with the box? You're telling me a heavyset 50 year old woman can move faster than an immortal being capable of teleporting inside a secure government building on the other side of the planet and back in the blink of an eye? What?

The after credits scene...so much...so wrong. They had the opportunity to make it an epic contest of wills, instead it came across as a a wimpy negotiation between a Bruce Wayne who's suddenly not smart enough in this universe to put the meta human puzzle together and needs to steal info from everyone from Lex Luthor to AW and then makes Waller seem like a puss for wanting his protection...

How about this instead:

Interior Waller Residence -Night

Heavily armed guards patrol the exceptionally well protected estate of Amanda Waller as she sleeps. A clock reads 3AM. The camera stops on a sleeping Amanda Waller and begins to close in on her. Our music gets increasingly, horror movie-intense as we close in on her sleeping face. Suddenly her eyes open. Someone is there. As she sits up we see her POV as The Bat rises like a monster from the foot of the bed. It's like a nightmare, but the monster is real and he's pissed.

AW: I was wondering when you'd show up.  I needed confirmation about the Metas. You're the only one with that kind of data.

(BM throws a file on her bed that reads ""compromised files MetaHuman Project"". BM glides eerily towards her, the menace is palpable as he gets within inches of her face, she stares back, unafraid.)

BM: Be careful Waller. If you keep prying into my business, there's no place on earth you'll be safe.

AW: I'll take that under consideration. Lock the door on your way out, Bruce. 

Snap to black.

Ohhh, suddenly Batman is able to move about with impunity, isn't begging for scraps of info and Waller gets to show she's not afraid of a rich guy in a bat suit and establishing them both as being in conflict instead of a working partnership.

This film is a mess.",4w86a7

d64znge,"Having no background on the Suicide Squad prior i enjoyed this movie. It was by no means perfect but i think that for what they wanted to get out of the real main characters, they did. Harley was played well, Deadshot was amazing, Flag was good as well. Amanda Waller was done to perfection and IMO the Joker was portrayed well and fit the film. While a lot people probably didn't care for him, IMO he fit the role of this film pretty well. They definitely just kind of threw some moments and characters in there but we can't have a 4 hour movie i suppose. More importantly i think they can learn from what they did wrong here and get it right in the sequel(s). I don't know how many movies they will make but as long as they can kind of move away from the mistakes everyone is talking about with this film and get it right in the 2nd one they have an all-star cast that can keep them being pretty good. I'd like to see less random loud music at times and more seriousness. I think that is where they went wrong, they just added in these random jokes and then want to go back and try and be a serious film. As long as they just make a better sequel(because we know there is room for improvement and a hell of a good movie if done right) and put those deleted Joker scenes on the Blu Ray i'll be a happy camper. I'll give it a 7/10. And i would recommend seeing it.",4w86a7

I can't believe Leto went so method and over the top for about 5 minutes of screen time. Actually I can because...Jared Leto.

d65rmsv,"Just got back from it. This is one of those rare films where it's obviously not a good film in the slightest (underdeveloped characters, inconsistent tone, awful villain, abhorrent editing) and yet at the same time there's admittedly a lot of fun to be had (entertaining action sequences, cool visuals, excellent performances, a ton of heart). It's enjoyable but simultaneously underwhelming. Hopefully, in a few months, Warner Bros. and DC will get their asses in gear and release David Ayer's original darker cut on Blu-ray.",4w86a7
d660li5,"I thought it was decent, I personally prefer Dawn of Justice above this but it had its moments. The positives are the performances by Robbie and Smith as well as Leto, the batman cameos are not distracting and actually mean something to the story and the surprise flash cameo was good. The first 45 minutes or so of the movie are what I wanted, very entertaining and shed a lot of light on the characters, but then the movie becomes a mess. Almost all of the negatives occur in the 2nd and 3rd acts which bascially are all one big battle scene interlaced with flashbacks, which sadly are all we pretty much see of the Joker. Leto does a great job but his screen time is so limited and short, he looks amazing in flashbacks of him and Robbie that I hope DC includes this Joker in future films. Every other member of the suicide squad besides Harley Quinn and Deadshot is pretty much forgettable and barely fleshed out. Jai Courtney actually tries for once but he barely has any scenes. The villain of the movie is basically Enchantress and her brother sort of thing (most of Delevinge's dialogue is subtitled when she is Enchantress and I saw the movie in Mexico so it was tough to follow) who create an army by turning people into these weird creatures? I can't even sum up the plan of the villain because it is that forgettable and bad. So much time is dedicated to this character and this army that I felt myself wondering if the movie was over multiple times. This was the main negative of the movie besides the lack of Joker. Also there is little explanation given for why Waller and the Joker come back from certain death in this movie, which really dumbfounded me. Overall it seems like DC was trying to address the complaints about Dawn of Justice by making  this movie seem less overcrowded, but in their effort they failed as it seems like not much of anything really happens for much of the movie. Overall Suicide Squad is a 6/10 for me.",4w86a7

There were moments of decent acting but even then it was surrounded by lots of cringey moments and bad line delivery. The cast here is pretty solid for the most part so I have to point the finger at the director and the writers who really dropped the ball. The plot was lame and predictable. The relationships that were supposed to evoke feelings: Flag/Enchantress, Harley/Joker, Diablo/Wife all just either fell flat or were let down by bad acting and bad writing. The weird special effects were incredibly distracting and added absolutely nothing except confusion. The soundtrack was there simply to make money and really took away from the film at certain points.

-I hate DC's rage-on for the dark filter colour over the whole damn movie. Batman I understand could/should be dark but superman should be bright colours and inspire hope. This movie should have been more bright and wacky kinda like GotG.

-I was really trying to like this Joker but I honestly just plain hate him. The Joker should be this menacing person with a master plan with crazy intelligence not some crazy gangster. He's suppose to be one of batman's greatest nemesis but I can't see how he would give this Batman a hard time.

-Small thing here but I didn't like the music chosen. I didn't feel it fit the movie and drew me out of it.

-The editing and pacing of the movie was just off. It goes from intense or high action scenes to slow scenes and reverse. A lot of the flashbacks didn't fit where they were shown.

-Some of the writing and jokes either fell flat or was just really bad. There was a couple good ones but for a movie about wacky characters the whole audience should have been laughing throughout.

-What was the point of Killer Croc, Cap Boomerang, Slipnot and Katana. You could have removed them and the film would have been pretty much the same...

-Enchantress was too strong of a villain for them to be fighting over. Most of the team doesn't have powers and were fighting her,her brother and an army with guns. In this movie the suicide squad is suppose to go against someone like superman who is as strong but how is a team that consists of Killer Croc suppose to beat a ""superman"".

What I did Like:

-Will Smith did ok as Deadshot

-Harley Quinn was really good.

-Amanda Waller was perfect.

I mean compare to something else considered good, or mediocre like Thor 2. They both have shitty boring villains but at least Suicide Squad was a fun movie.

d67ye49,"Probably the worst movie I've seen in theaters. After the reviews came out I tried to set my expectations super low, but the movie managed to go even lower than that.

- Will Smith didn't play Deadshot, he just played Will Smith. Smith should have been cast as Flag, and someone else should have played Deadshot. 

- Killer Croc looked like shit and is apparently a walking racial stereotype. Since the team was put together to fight another potential Superman it would have made more sense to include Croc as a member if he were the huge monstrous beast version of himself rather than the normal sized guy with a giant head version that we got.

d66fakn,[deleted],4w86a7
d675cv5,"I thought about this a bit. This movie was essentially guardians of the galaxy - a bunch of misfits and antiheroes team up to defeat some worse bad guy. deadshot = starlord, harley = gamora, boomerang = rocket, croc = groot, katana = drax. so why was it worse in every way?  

a) characterisation. all of gotg's characters get a chance to shine and do something useful. they get camera time and dialogue that develops their characters and the plot. they have sideplots that affect the main story. in ss only harley and deadshot exist as characters. the rest barely appear on screen or have any dialogue. their contributions are laughable or barely affect the plot. the little backstory we get on the others (katana) doesn't explain why they are there or what they are doing.

b) tone. gotg was fun and campy. it knew what it was trying to be. SS struggles with what all of the DCEU's films have struggled with thus far - trying to have both gritty real world stuff like government conspiracies and CIA blacksites, with campy nonsense (start with the guy with the boomerang and go from there). the result is the tone lurches from light hearted fun to dark and murdery with no in between.

c) writing. enchantress is barely introduced before she escapes and blows up the city. she teleports into amanda's room and then...decides not to kill her for some reason. the heart which is supposedly her weakness turns out not to be for some reason. she can instantly disarm the whole squad but has a knife fight with them for some reason. the squad sent in to stop her is comprised of humans and slightly enhanced humans, which makes no sense at all given she is an immortal magic-user. the film asks the question ""what would these people do if superman ripped the top off the white house"", to which the answer is ""get killed instantly""

d) pacing and editing that makes no sense. this is the third DCEU film in a row that has excessive flashbacks interrupting the main story and a nonlinear plot. whole plot development points seem to have been left on the cutting room floor. i really don't understand either this obsession with constant flashbacks, pointless subplots that go nowhere, and a narrative that jumps around all over the place. how anyone could look at this as a finished product and not a total mess is beyond me. 

it is not different issues plaguing these DC films as they churn out one disaster after another. its the same issues - ignoring the basic building blocks of filmmaking.",4w86a7

d68vmok,"**Incoming Giant Wall of Text !!!**  
  
**TL;DR:** I was pumped for this movie and it really wasn't what I expected, but man oh man do I have gripes with this film. I'm having a hard time thinking of everything that felt so wrong with this movie, but these are the immediate things that come to mind below.
  
**Use of Title in Movie**  

- So... Were a ""Suicide Squad""? I can't stand terrible uses of the movie title in the movie itself. Soylent green is an object. It is okay to talk about it as the object is no secret and is obviously the main focal point of the film. I even don't mind a cheesey movie trailer where Movie Trailer Guy says ""Steven Segal is... Under Siege"" or ""Steven Segal is... Out For a Kill"", thats fine. When Someone in the movie says ""We're Under Siege"" I can't stand it. It is a stupid point I know, but it just irks the hell out of me and removes me from my current point of immersion.  
  
**Forced Music**  
  
- They had what... 15 different songs in the first 15 minutes of the movie? /S Was it House of the Rising Sun that was playing when we first saw the prison at the start of the movie? There were so many songs used I lost track of what played when. The Bohemian Rhapsody Trailer for the Movie is by far one of the best trailers I've ever seen. It was cut very well and the music, sound effects, explosions, and body language fit so well with the music at each stage of the song. The [2nd Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWvzhfI4SuM) also had good use of songs with You don't own me then jumping into ballroom blitz, but only upon seeing the movie did I start to realize how hard they were trying to force scenes/emotions by playing off major pop culture songs. Bohemian Rhapsody, Without Me, Fortunate Son all seemed out of place... I feel like I'm missing some songs too. I really like Heathens and it was the only song that I felt wasn't out of place and again, the trailer using Heathens was really well timed with the music. All in all, I just felt the music used was inappropiate, gimmicky and out of touch as a feeble attempt to connect with the audience.  
  
**Bad Editing/WTF?**   
  
- When Deadshot finds the Top Secret Folder and picks it up he immediately goes into rage mode and then storms off into the bar. So... they have a file on him and everyone else, why is Deadshot so mad and what is the big deal? Clearly at this point the audience knows Flag and Enchantress are smashing uglies, but I feel like this point was confusing. I lost my immersion as I literally was trying to figure out what exactly was the problem. Was there something else in the folder the audience didn't know about? Not until Flag goes into the bar and admits he has been sleeping with Enchantress does it make more sense, but it just doesn't work. I feel like they originally had a scene with Deadshot panning thru the pages and saw relationships or a photo of them kissing or something, but the scene got cut as they didn't need both the book and bar scene to say the same thing. Those 5 extra seconds would have made that entire scene flow more cohesively. I'm also trying to remember how much info they had on Enchantress and if at this point they even knew she was the bad guy or just ""missing"".  
  
- How exactly did Harley get into an elevator, already be going up AND past 2-3 floors before they notice, but somehow magically have enough time to chase off after her and somehow BEAT HER ELEVATOR and have enough time to just stand around waiting for her? I have no issue with movie magic and allowing wiggle room for ""How did X do Y"", because... It is a movie, have some imagination, but ugh... It just didn't make sense and again... Immersion.  
  
- Waller just kills everyone. They were in the wrong place at the wrong time? They weren't cleared for this, but I needed people to help me and now they gotta die. Yea... Because no one else in the city saw the giant floating lights in the sky or saw news coverage of the attacks. Cat is out of the bag, what more was she hiding? Justice League? Bruce Wayne? I just... Again this is a scene where I understand they want to convey the personality of the character, but god damn I hated that scene.  

**Story Telling Leap of Faith Prize**  
  
- Diablo says I already lost one family I'm not losing another? Really... They are a ""Family""? He just met these people that day. I didn't really see much bonding and the stuff I did see felt really forced. Hey! Lets all talk to each other about escaping when the time is right! Let's work together !!! Also... Did Captain Boomerang expect to escape or did he setup Slipknot to see if the bombs were actually true? It didn't seem like he tried too hard to escape when he said to make the move. (Edit: So apparently Slipknot was tricked in the comics, good to know.)  
  
**Bad Writing**  
  
- Quite A lot of it, poor attempts to have ""quirky, laughable moments"" that just didn't feel right.  
  
- Stupid vocal character narration. This is Katana, her sword eats the souls of her victims, blah blah blah. It didn't feel right and I know recently people were dissecting the trailer that came out saying how Harley was actually the worst part in that scene, but I disagree. That whole scene was so bad, but what Flag said just didn't feel natural and was forced upon the audience as a character background introduction.
- That wierd sleep with my girlfriend if you want to with Joker and Common. It was really awkward and I guess they were trying to show how crazy and jealous the joker was in general, but that scene didn't seem to flow for me.",4w86a7
d64xat2,The last 45-60min on till the end (Basically as soon as El Diablo went crazy for the first time) felt like a great David Ayer movie. The first 60-75min were a little bit of a mess with some Ayer flavor mixed in. Leto was great in his few scenes though. Can't wait to see more. Still an all-around fun movie. Will definitely see again.,4w86a7
d65n70d,"So fucking terrible and all over the place.

Pacing was awful. Flashbacks randomly inserted throughout to attempt to elicit some empathy/reaction from the audience.

Most of the squad felt forced into the movie. The way Katana jumped into the back of the helicopter right as it was taking off is exactly how I felt they treated her character and others- uh, just jump in where you can, this movie is going somewhere.

No one understood how these characters and their abilities worked- Deadshot just shot at things like any average person, Harley was taking on hulking monsters while wearing high heels and nothing but a dumbass baseball bat (the hollow sound it made when it hit made me cringe), etc.  There was nothing interesting or original in how they dealt with their foes. No strategy, no real teamwork, nothing.

I loved the constant inconsistencies. Oh, look, a magical entity is taking over a city. Let's just give these inmates 2 hours to get ready and play dress up. And Harley's hair magically gets cut and dyed in the process.

d6576m4,"The movie was cringe worthy. Very bad story structure. Even an amateur knows to follow the Checkov Gun rule. On the bright side, they finally found a role for Jai Courtney to not make u be like oh fuuuuck u... Also Native American fans must be fuckin pissed. ",4w86a7

This is the first time in 27 years, that I've been this disappointed by something that was meant to be entertaining. I'm kind of hurt, actually...

I LOVED each of the characters (minus slipknot, of course).. but the film itself was *badly* edited. I'm sure I could have done a better job with zero experience. 

I'm happy we got Leto's Joker, Robbie's Harley.. Deadshot was cool - and surprisingly, Jai Courtney's Boomerang is one of my favorite comic book characters put to film... everything else? A total fucking mess.

d67ae4s,"I liked the movie. Sure, it had it's problems, but the good slightly outweighed the bad in this. If there was one thing I had to say about the movie, is that there was a lack of development as a team. Sure, one member talked to another, but there was a lack of overall thought across the board unless it came from El Diablo(Who, by the way, was the best part of the movie.). Any time he talked the whole team listened and I think we needed more than that rather than the side chatter. It made the team a bit disjointed. I know this might be awkward to say, but I think GotG pulled this off really well in contrast.  

 I don't believe this was the jackpot, but they're getting closer. It doesn't deserve as low a score as RT is giving it, but I don't think I would give it anything glowing. My score is a 6.5/10",4w86a7

d64ymuy,"I was honestly surprised I liked this movie. After the reviews started coming in I was expecting it to go downhill after being let down by BvS, but it was pretty good honestly. The beginning seemed a bit rushed and Jared Leto's Joker was awful in my opinion. Common and Scott Eastwood were really a waste in the movie that served no purpose and should've been cut. Everyone else was decently written and had good chemistry for the most part, Overall it was really fun to watch and I'll probably see again.
Edit: Sure Enchantress didn't have that great of motivation, but I'd rather watch her over the villain that no one remembers in Guardians of the Galaxy. ",4w86a7
d64z60c,"Just got out of the theater and had an absolute blast throughout the movie. It wasn't perfect, but I'll be damned if it wasn't entertaining; objectively, I'd give it a 7.5:10. Some lines seemed forced or clunky (""You're my family now"" was moan-worthy) and the driving plot was scattershot as best, but it was a fun ride regardless. 

So far as characters with the most screentime go:

* Margot Robbie was a fun interpretation of Harley Quinn and gave a decent illustration of Joker twisting Quinzel into his most loyal victim (though I wished they would have shown more of Joker actually manipulating her and not just the lengths that she would go to).
* Jared Leto came in with a new, (in my opinion) fantastic, and nigh predatory Joker. I'm sure some won't like him, however I thought he gave a new interpretation of the character that was separate and distinct from both Hamill's and Ledger's roles and was more than able to hold his own in the brief moments you see him 
* Will Smith played a decent Slade/Deadshot insomuch that his character seemed to have drive, pathos, and above all didn't seem to just be ""Will Smith playing Will Smith"".
* Viola Davis played a cold Amanda Waller that (usually) kept the deck stacked in her favor. The scene where she randomly shoots the office workers felt like too much of a try hard moment to show how ""cold"" she was, though I felt was entirely unnecessary. I do hope she has the opportunity to develop into ""The Wall"" in the future.
* Cara Delevinge was a mixed bag. June Moon existed more or less in name only, and while she did a great job with the portrayal of the shadowy/twitchy Enchantress, the moments where she was at 'full power' were pretty.. bad. I found myself wondering if Enchantress was just supposed to be badly dancing in front of the lightning bolt for the entire movie.

The rest of the cast did a fantastic job, however I definitely felt that they did not get enough screen-time (especially Katana as I honestly forgot she was there half the time). Though being as the movie was mostly marketed with Smith and Robbie were heavily advertised as the incumbent heavyweights, I can understand the unfair distribution. In all, I'm very excited to see more expansion into this universe away from the doom and gloom of BvS.

If you go into this movie expecting another Dark Knight, then of course you're going to be disappointed. However if you are looking for an explosive comic book movie, then I'm willing to say that you're in for a treat. ",4w86a7
d64zaed,"The jokers crew was awesome, Enchantress was cool until she turned. Will smith and Margot stole the show. Katana was criminally underused, she was cool as hell. The villain was probably the worst villain ever, what even was his name? Overall 6/10",4w86a7

It's more of the way he was written rather than Leto's interpretation of the role but when in the world has Joker ever been this obsessed with Harley Quinn?

I actually did enjoy suicide squad quite a bit, but I think there was potential for it to be great. Hope we get Ayers so called darker version on the BluRay.",4w86a7
d65hhlz,"I've read a couple of Suicide Squad comics and I knew the gist of what I was going into, but is it just me or does the film give absolutely no justification for why Harley and Captain Boomerang are in the suicide squad? 

If Waller's plan is to assemble a team to prevent the threats of meta-humans or the next Superman who doesn't share their ideals, then what value does Harley Quinn provide? Yes, she's crazy, but they literally send her into a war-zone with meta-human activity with a baseball bat and a single gun. Arguably, Captain Boomerang's actual boomerang can do some funky stuff (as alluded to at the end) - but even so, the film does nothing to justify why Harley must be part of this elite team. This is even more ridiculous when you have El Diablo who acts as the team's nuclear option.

Now, from a story perspective, if the Joker's goals were somehow interconnected to Waller's plans then I could understand adding Harley to the mix (she's the Joker's Achilles heel), but the Joker turning up to save Harley is entirely co-incidental to the plot and has nothing to do with Waller's plan. 

I don't think the film even alludes to Harley as a specially skilled fighter, or so crazy that she'll always win - we only learn that she's capable when the fighting begins (again... with a baseball bat?)

I raised this with the people I saw the movie with and the only answer they could come up with ""She's part of the suicide squad in the comics"", which is fine, but in this story there doesn't seem to be any reason for her to be there. 

This is so baffling given she's a headliner in the film.",4w86a7

d66yzze,"I really didn't like how Joker viewed Harley as an equal and truly cared for her.

It just didn't seem like Joker. Joker doesn't care about anybody except himself and views Harley as a disposable sex object he could replace any moment. The only thing Joker cares about is himself, and Batman. 

It just felt wrong and so out of character. Jared Leto wasn't even a good Joker either, the way he acted felt so forced and cringey. Harley and Joker's relationship and Joker's acting just completely ruined the film for me.",4w86a7

There was a lot of potential here, and I certainly liked it more than BvS, but it's still just god-awful. The cast and characters are wasted on a stupid fucking story and a stupid fucking villain. Could have been so much better if there were fewer characters and it was a smaller scale and more intimate, character-driven story. Maybe going after the Joker. ",4w86a7

Although the joker didn't play a large role in it, he definitely played the wild card well, which is just what I expected from him in this movie anyways.

d6gyla3," Suicide Squad was the worst movie I have ever seen. The following is a few of the MANY things I could criticise about it:

 If you just delete the Joker from the movie, it would make no difference. It would even make the movie BETTER to keep Joker in the dark by only mentioning him rather than giving him 10 minutes of screen time with literally zero impact on the whole story. This has nothing to do with Jared Leto's acting, he played a very different Joker from the Joker played by Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger and he did a good job. However I could not compare him to the other two because simply his scenes were basically just for decoration purposes. I have watched Batman since I was a kid and I literally felt scammed watching Suicide Squad due to how insignificant the Joker was. For me, The Joker is a much more interesting and complicated character than Batman and any other DC villain. The only reason TDKR was seen as not as good as TDK is because the Joker, as a character, has a limitless potential, as compared to Bane. 
 Of course, my opinion may be biased based on how much I am into the Joker as a character. However you can't disagree with me that it feels like an advertising scam to see how insignificant a role the Joker plays in that movie.

 Similarly, the character Killer Croc is completely expendable, as well as the Boomerang guy, Katana chick. I dont know about you but for me, such redundancy in storytelling is just outright terrible.

 Overalls, Suicide Squad is a movie undeniably inappropriate for children, yet mindbogglingly incomprehensible for adults. ",4w86a7
d65aqh5,"Save your money and stream this movie. It sadly reminded me of the pre-Marvel/pre-Dark Knight era of superhero movies where they were more of a joke than actual cinema.

Will Smith and Margot Robbie do a decent job and without them this movie is a total bust. I personally didn't like Jared Leto's Joker but I think that's more a fault of the writing then himself. Speaking of writing, prepare for some cringe worthy one liners that will leave you shaking your head in embarrassment.

This movie had great potential but with so many characters and so little development you don't feel connected to any of them. Couple that with a boring villain who wants to kill humanity just cause and awful editing to give the movie zero flow and you have Suicide Squad.

",4w86a7
d64yuw5,"I understand now why the critics reviews were so negative towards this movie. This movie litteraly felt like one of my old high school film projects I had to edit the night before it was due. Extremely choppy in editing and continuity, probably due to re shooting in order to make the movie more ""fun"".

Obvious in some scenes that there were two completely different tones of footage. Kinda like having to do a puzzle with pieces from another puzzle mixed in.

Overall though, better than Bats v. Supes. 
6.8/10",4w86a7
d650qzn,"This frustratingly feels like a superhero movie that would've come out around '03-'07 amidst your Ghost Riders and Daredevils and the like but with a glossier, darker 2016 coat of paint on it.

Like, the concept (a team of all villains are a suicide squad) would seemingly lend itself to all sorts of interesting takes on the superhero genre in 2016 but not only does it skew infuriatingly safe and risk-free it's like none of the nuance or vision that Batman Begins/The Dark Knight and Iron Man influenced and inspired in the superhero genre  almost ten years ago is in the least bit on display here. This movie is really more in line with cartoonier*, dumber fare that it felt like we had long since moved past like Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer than any good superhero movie that came out in the past 7-8 years and it's mind-blowing to me that DC can be turning out yet another movie that feels so fucking clueless and behind on the times.


*And I'm not referring to the colorful, flashy, stylized aesthetics of the movie (sets, costume design, SFX, visual design, etc.) that was one of the few things about the movie I actually liked a lot and felt was really fresh and invigorating.  ",4w86a7
d651vqn,"It was fun, not laugh out loud at any moment but it got the audience giggling. The joker was alright, bit quickly cut together and pretty much every scene from the trailers was shown or cut. It made me want to see more of him at least. Amanda Waller was just as ruthless as I would have wanted, she was great fun.    
Most of the one liners and jokes were shown in the trailer though, so everytime they came up I just expected them, no real laughs from those moments.     
I get the pacing issues, the start felt too long, the mid section felt like it should have ended sooner and the big finale climax battle was over really quickly. The action was fun though, the characters were well acted as well, I want more deadshot, Harley and Captain Boomerang. It's good that the universe expanded so much.    
6/10 in my opinion. Rotten tomatoes feels fairly unfair because people see the 27% and immediately shun the movie.      

Edit: The cameos from JL were fun too, and enchantress was acted weirdly but when she actually started fighting she looked pretty damn creepy, she was OP though and got beaten way too easily by such a boring fake out      
Edit 2: Action was generic as hell, just cool shots of weird people getting sliced, nothing to really make it unique or anything. They just wanted some characters to looks cool whilst beating up generic baddies. It's nothing stand out or anything ",4w86a7
d6522hr,"Pleasantly surprised by Jai Courtney - I may be in the minority here, but he was my favorite character.",4w86a7
d6539qi,"Katana and Captain Boomerang were underused. The attempts of him trying to charm
her were played mostly as laughs. If he'd save her life just once in the movie it'd
would've elevated that arc a little. I liked the idea of the ""GoPro boomerang"" but
sadly that was the only interesting thing he did. We're shown a bit of Katana's
backstory but not a lot of people react to it / her, so again, underused character.

Slipknot. Ah, Slipknot. We hardly knew ye. You did not exist in the prison and you
existed for about 2 minutes outside the prison. And we knew that was going to happen
because the studio didn't think it necessary to make up a backstory for you; we were
merely counting down the seconds from the moment you appeared. A missed chance for a
surprise.

The banter between Flagg and Deadshot was good. Joel Kinnaman plays it straight
with a hint of jadedness. Will Smith is Will Smith, entertaining as always.

El Diablo has a tragic backstory and appears uninterested in fighting. He doesn't
make much of a connection with the rest of the team which makes his sudden motivations 
in the third act really thin. Killer Croc doesn't have much of a story and even less
motivation. Good then that there's a bomb underwater, that gives him something to do.

Margot Robbie gives Harley Quinn a good mix of crazy, sexy and vulnerable. But the
movie never made me believe a small woman with a baseball bat could succesfully hold 
her own in the Squad. As such it was more obvious to me that she needed to be there 
for the Joker to come get her. The Joker's interesting and fun but the whole gangster 
and build-up-my-empire storyline seemed to belong in a different movie.

The villains were not that impressive. They seem to exist in a vacuum; besides one
general crying out 'How the hell do they know all these things' there was no
attempt to find out what happened, there was no apparent consequence for Waller
for letting things get out of hand. Since Waller knew the exact number of years
that the Enchantress had been alive you would think she knew a lot more about
the ancient witch than she let on (or even know that there was more than one ancient
creature) - but we aren't shown any of that. Waller is just as surprised as the rest of us.
Waller shooting a bunch of nameless guys seemed cheap and worked only as a 
setup for a Will Smith line. And besides some infrastructural mayhem that we are now
so familiar with and converting some people into soldiers consisting of eyeballs (?)
the villains didn't seem to have much of a threat to the Squad.

Disappointing that the Joker's forces and the Enchantress' forces never meet; would've
been nice to have the Enchantress offer the Joker his deepest desires and have the
Joker just shit all over her, because he's the Joker. Also the Joker never seems to
be aware or care that somebody else is conquering / ending the world. You'd think that he
would have something to say about that. Missed opportunity.

Visually the movie is really dark and rainy. Combined with the 3D glasses which in
my case cut even more light it was hard to make out what was happening at times. And
why does it always have to be dark and rainy in the DCEU? It makes the tone a bit
depressing. The plot was a bit incoherent. The introductions in the beginning seem
tacked on and the graphics flash by so quicky you can hardly read the rapsheets. I
think I saw the name Robin in connection with Harley Quinn but I'm not sure.

All in all my verdict is, like BvS: 'not bad'. It could've been much better though.

I'm hoping there will be an Ultimate Cut.

Biggest problem with the film was the lack of dialogue and character development. It definitely felt like a lot of footage was left on the cutting room floor. Things such as Deadshot and Boomerang appearing seemingly upset when they believed Harely got killed and Diablo saying that the squad was his ""2nd family"" after barley sharing any dialogue between the squad previously.

Even with the lack of dialogue most of it was hit and miss, there was missed opportunity with Harley and Boomerang. Both actors did great in their roles but the dialogue fell flat more often the not.

The joker sublot also felt unnecessary, I feel like it could of been dropped in favor of more development between the squad.

Also, given how smart phones and all that exist, how is anyone remotely able to hide from the general public the events in Metro City. The world would know. Lastly, the Joker and his gang of six people somehow break in, in the easiest fashion possible to the black site in Louisiana, then just walk out. They have the same relative level of firepower as the guards in the prison, but are severely outnumbered, yet handle them all. I know it's a movie, a comic book one at that, but come on, make it one iota of believable. The villain is a whole other story unto itself. ",4w86a7

Honestly I think this movie would have been great if it had an R-rating. A lot more gore, a lot more cursing, and it would have given the comedy a bit more edge as well.

Also Katana. wtf.

The one thing I will take away from this movie is the engineering marvel that is modern military aviation. Multiple helicopter crashes. No fatalities. No scratches. Whoever is putting those choppers together deserves a raise.

Ike berenholtz was my favorite part of the movie by far

I was pissed that the part with enchantress showing them their true desires because deadshot's was that he got to shoot batman! Which is all wrong! His motivation wasn't that he hated batman, but that he wants to provide for his daughter

Harley quinn had some of the worst dialogue, and I feel bad for margot because no one could make those lines work..... maybe Tom Hanks.

Some of the characters had absolutely no purpose for being in the movie! And I'm not even talking about slipknot (we all knew he was a goner). I'm referring to boomerang and katana mostly.

The fight scenes were dark and impossible to see, not to mention the quick cuts that confused the shit out of me... also I could never see who was killer croc and who were the bad guys.

The scene with flash was fucking awesome, and so was the part with deadshot on the car just going to town while everyone else just started watching.

I want to preface things by saying I'm a massive DC Comics fan. I read them. I collect them. I adore the lore, characters, yadda, yadda, yadda. I'd be considered a fanboy, I guess, but I can identify shit quality when I see it. 

This movie wasn't terrible. It wasn't good. It was just kind of.. there. When watching the trailers, I found Will Smith to be the most flat thing about them. Will Smith was the best part of the movie. Will Smith from the trailers was the bar to beat and it didn't really happen. 

There's CLEAR evidence of studio meddling. I suspect after the second trailer (or first official trailer) came out with Bohemian Rhapsody playing, WB/DC saw how fans went nuts over it and decided to ham-fist as many popular songs into the movie as they could, which most likely wasn't originally planned. It was so fucking jarring. Boom. Sympathy for the Devil. Boom. Paranoid. Boom. Fortunate Son. Boom. Spirit in the Sky. All of those songs played within the same 10 minute span. That's way too much. 

The Joker's scenes were hacked to pieces. You could sort of get a glimpse of what Leto was trying to do, but just as he'd get going, the scene would change. I like the idea of real love between The Joker and Harley and hope we get to see more of that one day (I've never liked their relationship in the comics or animated series - too one sided and masochistic.) 

Slipknot was dropped into the movie out of nowhere, with no explanation or backstory (or character title sequence, like the rest of them). It was just too obvious that he was there for the sole purpose to prove the bombs in their necks were real. That could have been handled better. 

The standouts are definitely Will Smith, Joel Kinneman, and Margot Robbie. Everyone else wasn't utilized enough for me to form an opinion, or completely fucking laughable (Killer Croc). El Diablo spends the entire movie being a non-character, only to die when he starts to become someone of interest. His final moments are extremely badass, though.

The highlights for me: The final battle was pretty good. As far as superhero climactic battles go, it was fun. The effects were good and Incubus looked pretty awesome. The creepy version of Enchantress would have been PERFECT for a Justice League Dark movie, so I hope she's not gone for good. 

Also, what the fuck? Did Scott Eastwood sacrifice himself, or did I miss something? I feel like that was supposed to have more of an emotional impact than it did. 

Anyway, I'd give it a 4/10. 

EDIT: For comparison, BvS was a 2/10.

And at least the former two were interesting characters, but it felt like an elongated video game from 45 minutes until the end.",4w86a7
d67wjja,"Will buy this movie in the future as a guilty pleasure while having some drinks. 

The choice of so much music in the film was rather....questionable to say the least but it was nice hearing ""Without Me"", ""Fortunate Son"", and of course ""Bohemian Rhapsody.""",4w86a7
d67wnnm,"Couple of good scenes (loved Joker and Harley in the vat, looked fantastic) and the acting is fine all round but at its core it's just poorly, poorly written. There's no real identifying themes to latch onto, just a smattering of ""We're the bad guys wait maybe we're not so bad after all"". They had a chance to really dig deep here but threw it away. That wouldn't be a movie killer usually but there's also no discernable character development for any of the characters. Diablo was my favourite character but his development consisted of the squad becoming his new family. When exactly did that happen?! Why does he suddenly give a shit about them? 

I feel like the film rested on the relationship between Deadshot and Flagg, which was fine but, like Diablo, didn't develop naturally. It's like they decided to set a marker on the bar scene (which was my favourite as it actually had them act like a team) and said ""Okay, character development over here! Aaand now you're a team, congrats!"" 

Also most of the characters were useless. People shit on Whedon for Age of Ultron but he could at least juggle characters and give everyone a respectable amount of development and screentime. Katana, Killer Croc and Boomerang did almost nothing the entire film. Though I loved Courtney's Boomerang, provided a great amount of comic relief.

Think it's too early to judge Leto's Joker, think he did fine but he never felt menacing or scary. 

Harley... good performance from Robbie (though poor wardrobe choice as her ass was waaay too distracting) but, for the most part, forced. Couple of times where she actually felt like a character, like after she thought Joker died, but mostly felt like a meme generator, and unfortunately most of it wasn't funny. Too much of the film is spent telling us that she's crazy and insane but what does she actually do in the film that gives any indication of that? Steal a purse? 

And that's what I think this movie's biggest problem is, non-existent characters. It didn't feel like a group of people, it felt like a group of origin stories and quirky personalities. Any attempt at elevating them beyond being surface characters is poorly handled and lazily written. Flagg's main motivation is that he loves June but that's never shown to us. They think that if it's in his quick origin story montage then that's all the heavy lifting they have to do, no more character work needed. They just assume we'll care from that point onwards. 

All of this already handicaps a movie greatly, but couple that with absolutely terrible editing and pacing, no directorial touch whatsoever besides quirky character descriptions (really disappointed with Ayer, this felt like any other studio film), unimaginative action scenes and what is probably the most boring villain I've ever seen since Galactus... 41 is about right.

Edit: also shout out to Ike Barinholtz who was hilarious as usual.

Edit 2: also great to see Hopper from Stranger Things!
",4w86a7
d67wpuy,"I just watched this movie and it's incredibly average imo. The squad itself doesn't really feel like ""bad guys"" to me. The character introductions felt too different from the rest of the film(though it is definitely the best part of the film). Katana, Killer Croc and Captain Boomerang are useless and can be removed entirely without affecting the story too much. The fight scene at the end is too foggy and you can barely see anything that happens, not to mention how stupid Enchantress fights. Enchantress is honestly the worst part of this movie, it was clear that the writers had no idea how to make her defeatable by the squad so they just made her wield two daggers instead of using her pyschic powers to fight them. The Joker is a hit or miss, I personally like Leto's joker but I can understand why other people don't. I think the biggest problem of this film is that the marketing team is too competent at their jobs at hyping up the people which resulted in many people's disappointment. Deadshot and Harley Quinn was really good though and they kept the movie entertaining by themselves.  
  
EDIT: I would also like to add that Katana's decision to quit the squad and drink doesn't really make sense to me since the whole reason she was there is to protect Flag and I don't think I saw her say a single word to the squad. And also the whole family/friend thing of El Diablo and Harley felt really forced considering that they have been together only for a few hours.",4w86a7

The movie was a bit of a jumble, and the editing was atrocious. The movie is weakened by a poor villain, and a bad actress playing said villain. Cara Delevingne was actually the only truly weak point in the  cast (aside from my gripe about Smith just being Smith...and my small gripe about Robbies ever changing crappy brooklyn accent) Jai Courtney did a good job, shockingly, considering his past work, and Katana, Diablo and Croc were mostly underused. Leto's joker wasn't bad, but it certainly didn't live up to what it was being sold as, either. 

All in all this was a mediocre movie. Certainly better than the terrible RT rating at least. This movie is at least as good as some of the bad Marvel superhero flicks (im looking at you Thor2, and IM2&3) which still have much better ratings for some reason.",4w86a7

There was no real plot, everything was all over the place with a bunch of random flashbacks. I was confused about a lot of things. I wasn't sold on Flag and Moone at all. While we did get some backstories for certain characters it was hard to connect to them or see them all as a team. Also, the amount of music changes annoyed me. I only like Heathens at the end, but I'm a biased twenty one pilots fan.

But I did love Will and Margot and I thought El Diablo was a cool character. I wish Adam Beach got more time for his character though. I also loved the look of Enchantress and her powers were interesting (I don't know much about the character). Those henchmen things reminded me of clickers.

So many times someone would say something about them being bad guys/criminals/villains. They said it more than they showed it.

Leto's Joker wasn't for me, and there was definitely a B movie feel to some (ok, all) of the plot points, but overall I enjoyed my time watching it.  

I think people got really burnt when they watched it with such high expectations, because the Suicide Squad angle really does lend itself for a potentially awesome movie. It wasn't that. But I thought it was much better than most of what I see because it kept me engaged. And, for what it's worth (and I know everyone will hate this comment), I thought it was magnitudes more interesting a film than Mad Max: Fury Road, which was basically just non-stop action with no character development and nice style/world building.",4w86a7
d64u59m,"So, with about a day to process everything, I’ve pretty much come to the conclusion that, while not an amazing film, it definitely deserves higher than a 28% on RT. I’ll do a quick breakdown of my reasoning, without spoiling anything.


First, the negatives. I only really had 2 major problems. First, the pacing at times, could have been better. There were about 2 times in the movie where I found it stagnating a bit, but only for about 5-10 minutes each time. Its wasn’t nearly as bad as BvS TC, which had about a 40-minute lull in the middle of the film. The 2nd problem, as many others have stated, was the villain. Without spoiling anything, the villain was super generic and had no motivation other than being evil. Reminded me a lot of some of the worse Marvel villains like Maraketh (?) from Thor 2 or even Ultron from Avengers 2.


A quick aside here about the editing issues i have been reading about. I personally didn't find the movie confusing or a mess or anything of the sort. Flashbacks are mostly confined to the the first act, in setting up the characters and are very clearly marked as flashbacks using visual cues. Only 1 was slightly out of place towards the end of the film. However, it was not long enough or complex enough to make me forget about what was happening in present day, and was really only a way to get inside the mind of a character, and understand their thoughts.


Now onto the things I liked. First and foremost, THE CHARACTERS. I was honestly shocked with how much I liked everyone. I was expecting to like Harley, but was iffy on most of the others. To my surprise Harley was actually my least favourite squad member (not saying shes bad AT ALL, I just really enjoyed all the others). For me Diablo was a stand-out, with a surprising amount of responsibility placed on him. Will Smith did Deadshot justice, being snarky, but also very emotional and serious when he needed to be. Boomerang was another stand-out to me, with everything he said or did getting huge laughs from the crowd (being in Australia may have affected that though haha). Croc, Katana and Slipknot where all cool, too, if slightly underused. The Joker is very different to any cinematic portrayal we have seen so far, but to me he was definitely still the Joker, and his look worked really well in this movie. 

Another major strength was the visuals. Although the fight choreography was nowhere near the level of BvS, the visuals were all stunning, and at times very Snyder-esque. None of the CGI work looked bad and IMO the very end fight with the villain looked amazing. Ayer made a very good choice in the way he decided to show the villain at the end of the fight (although the way it was shown just before that I didn’t like).


Now onto some big surprises of the movie (not plot spoilers, just stylistic choices that I didn’t expect – I guess some may consider them spoilers). The first thing, straight off the bat, is that the psychedelic colours of the trailers are actually sprinkled throughout, especially in the first act. I wasn’t expecting any of the marketing stuff to be in the movie, but it really was. Second was the soundtrack. There is WAY more licensed music than I was expecting, way more than on the soundtrack. That includes songs like Seven Nation Army and some Kanye, and many, many more.
Overall, I had an awesome time at the theater, and will definitely be going back to see it again. Was it a perfect movie? No, not by a long shot, but its definitely a good summer blockbuster well worth a viewing in the cinemas. With fun, lovable characters, interesting visuals, slightly drawn back by a lack-luster villain and some pacing issues, I’d say the movie is definitely worth a watch. Even if you don’t like the story, you’ll have a good time.",4w86a7
d65t7av,"For all the hate it was getting, I don't think it was really that awful...

It surely wasn't perfect, but it was fun. It looses a lot of its spirit once it gets to the action, honestly the best part is all the characters' introductions from the first act. 

And the joker... I mean, sure, he is not Ledger, but I think he was decent, right? Not every incarnation of the Joker has to be utter greatness, he did his part allright.

The music and the visuals are fantastic, when they manage to get away from the broody dark gritty shit.",4w86a7
d64tzlx,"When I see a movie with a lot of negativity around it, I can understand it. 

I understand how RT works, in that the 28% isn't a 28/100 rating, but a measure that 28 percent of critics liked the film. What I don't get is how that even happens. BvS was clearly edited to shit and back and we know WB meddled with it and there was so much cut that it deserved a low score, but this? I went in expecting a film about a team of edgelords shooting and fighting elder gods and I honestly can say that I got exactly that.

I'm not defending this as a perfect movie, but these films are getting scores near the Michael Bay Transformers films and I legitimately do not believe that they're that bad.",4w86a7

d64vynk,"I haven't hated a movie this much in a long time. I wasn't the biggest fan of BvS but that had some redeemable qualities.
The good: Will Smith was charming. They didn't waste much time on back stories which I thought was a nice touch. Too many movies insist on showing origin stories for everyone but this one understood that we know most the characters and didn't need that.
The bad: The CGI of enchantress and her brother were laughably bad. It looked like a snapchat filter. Whatever it was Leto was doing was an insult to the legacy of the Joker character. The tone was all over the place. The story was stretched very thin. They wasted all the characters and I feel bad for the guy in the croc makeup. They could've saved him a lot of time but instead they just made him some weird offensive black stereotype. I love Margot Robbie but she was too obnoxious.

d6591s3,"Saw it with the wife last night and we both agreed it was absolutely nowhere near the critics consensus. Is it perfect? No. Boomerang is a total waste and the movie has a hard time keeping pace after a fantastic opening 20mins, but never did either of us regret going.

d65mkss,Batman v Superman was a better movie. The Joker was so bad. All the re-writes and added humor seemed obvious. They should have kept the movie darker. Maybe it would have made sense then? It was just bad. 4/10,4w86a7

* The performances of Leto, Robbie, Smith, and Davis were all great
* The CGI is adequate in some scenes, good in others

The bad:

* The plot
* The editing
* The villains
* The pacing
* The dialogue
* The balance (in this case the imbalance) of characters
* The plot ""twist""
* And basically everything else

The critics were *mostly* right with this one. This is not a good movie.

d67a2fc,"Short: The movie isn't perfect, there's obviously a glaring amount of problems that stem mainly from the editing done by Warner Bros. However, it doesn't deserve the ~28% rotten rating and comparisons to Fant4stic.

Things I liked:

Amanda Waller: Viola Davis **killed** it as Amanda ""The Wall"" Waller. From the devious manipulation of Rick Flagg's love for Dr. Moon to downright executing her underlings because of their lack of clearance to see classified data, Waller was a force to be reckoned with. I also bought her motivation for not leaving initially. In a world without Superman, a being capable of creating literal armies is an asset that is invaluable. Of course, her ruthless pragmatism is what gets her in trouble but that's an acceptable character flaw that has been done before such as in Justice League Unlimited, i.e. CADMUS.

Rick Flagg: Another character I liked was Joel Kinneman's Rick Flagg. I liked how at first he treats Taskforce X like they're a liability. He fully expects them all to attempt to screw him over the first chance they get. He isn't dumb. And his eventual turn around with the Squad is really touching. He just wants to save the woman he loves, and him trashing his ""death control"" really sold the point that he was asking them to help him without any strings attached. A great way to change the dynamic from the team helping Flagg because he could kill them to them helping him because he respects them.

Enchantress' Plan to get out from under Waller's control: Taking advantage of Flagg's love for Dr. Moon to temporarily try to get her heart back. Once she sees that she can't get her heart back she immediately changes her plan and finds a way to escape Waller and survive for a time thanks to her brother. Who I think was Waller's backup in case Enchantress had to be put down for any reason.

El Diablo: Everyone knew he was going to be the one to sacrifice himself for the others but it's amazing the amount of emotional weight Ayer got out of this actor. My only complaint is I wish we had focused more on El Diablo and his struggle to remain pacifistic and eventually using his powers instead of focusing on Will Smith.

Things I thought were okay.


Harley Quin: I thought Margot Robbie was okay as Harley Quin but her portrayal definitely suffered under the studio cuts. We got some weird version of the Harley/Joker relationship where the Joker is some noble casanova who saves her from certain death instead of the more accurate abusive relationship in the comics. I know the studio chose this portrayal because it ""tested"" well but it was the completely wrong move.

The Joker: Unfortunately, Jared Leto's Joker suffered the most from the studio cuts. He's barely in the film enough to warrant him being there. I think a better decision would have been to leave him out entirely in favor of spending more time getting to know Taskforce X. In fact, I would have kept the breaking out of Harley as his only scene as a tease for the solo Batman film. At any rate, I saw enough of Leto's Joker to be interested in seeing him go up against Batman and understand Leto's anger at his scene's being cut down so much.

 Things I thought were bad.

Edits: I'm not talking cinematography, I'm talking the film cut given to us by Warner Bros. Now SS and BvS were already being slated to release before we got Geoff Johns being the creative head of the new DC Films so hopefully by Wonder Woman we won't see the absolute travesty of these dumb studio execs messing with these films. Let these directors do their jobs and trust them. I hope we get a director's cut of Suicide Squad because there are hints of a good movie in this pile of mess given to us by Warner Bros.

Will Smith as Deadshot: My biggest worry about this movie was Will Smith. I thought he was going to play Will Smith and ask for more focus on his character as a ""Big Movie Star"" would and because of it the movie suffered. The focus should not have been on Deadshot and his relationship with his daughter. That had nothing to do with the central plot of the movie. If anything more focus should have been given to Rick Flagg and Dr. Moon's relationship. That's what was truly at the heart of the film.

All in all, I'd say I hope this is the last time Warner Bros sabotages their own film and that they learn their lesson by Wonder Woman. Still if you can look past the blatant meddling by the studio and the obvious pandering to Will Smith there is an enjoyable popcorn movie in here.

Being a decades long comic book reader and fan, what WB did to BvS and SS are atrocious.
None of the creative guys, screen writers or directors understand some of the centrality of their iconic characters.



Here's some questions I had walking out the theater.
1/. Why didn't Batman just downright murder Joker and Harley? I mean the chase scene is evidently happened after the death of Jason, why the fuck would that Batman not only let Joker get away, but saved Harley? I mean for fuck sake this Batman use a railgun to shot down bunch of thugs without asking questions, use his Batwing to murdered half dozen guys in the warehosue fight scene in BvS?

2/. What is the point of Joker? by point I mean beyond his involvemnt in the film, but rather the essense of his character. Both Ledger/Nicholson Jokers were manic with intention of breaking the established order, Ledger's Joker particularly is fairly in tone with the Killing Joke in which he wants to prove it only takes one bad day to turn someone as noble as Dent to his level. Dafuq is this Joker doing the whole? being a gangster for...money? fame? Where's his obsession with Batman? He didn't even mention ""BATSYYYYY!"", it was fucking Quin.

3/. What exactly is the ultimate evil plan of the big bad? to turn everyone in the world into rock zombie? why destroy the carrier, satellite instead of the president or important personnel? or better yet, strike a thunder to kill off the entire SS.

4/. Where the hell was Flash and Batman the whole time, midway city was in ruined for 3 days and Barry didn't show up once? Okay..I mean Flash would literally end this crisis in minutes. 3 fucking days man...

5/. WHAT'S UP WITH THE GODS OF EGYPT BOSS? he is so disjointed with the rest of the characters, and his CGI effect is lame! 

6/. How long would the SS last again Superman? How many milliseconds? 

BTW, Cara Delevingne is the worst actress I have ever seen, she is unbearable not only in this one but in paper town too. Gosh her acting is ""Mean mugging + popping"" the whole time, she hurts my eyes despite her beauty .

I like DC comics but this...this is betrayal, Zack Snyder and David Ayer and whoever wrote the script neeeed to read some source material, need to understand the characters hell a lot better.

Will smith kinda carried this movie, I wish it didn't have to be that way, I've never liked deadshot as a character much personally. Margot Robbie's ass gave a great performance, the rest of her was pretty funny, she had a surprising amount of comedic depth. The soundtrack was dope, nearly guardians level. Also, did the producers say ""hey, people love that avengers movie and our movie is a teamup too, we should put a giant space laser that they have to stop just like avengers!""

d66i9xv,"A little late to the game but lets see 

SPOILERS, obviously:

**Things I liked:**

Viola Davis. Holy shit, I was so focused on the Squad before the movie I didn't expect her to be the stand out performer. She knocked it out of the fucking park.

Ben Affleck. I know he was marginally in this, but he might already be my favorite batman.

Jai Courtney. I know his character wasn't exactly nuanced or anything, but I thought he was fun and having fun playing Boomerang.

Visuals. You can say many things about Snyder as a director, but I've always liked his visuals and I enjoyed that Ayer was able to stay true to the ""house director"" style.

I actually liked the clunky chunk of exposition in the beginning where the baddies were introduced one by one as I'm not familiar with the comics. Helped follow the movie and actually remember the characters.

**Things I wasn't sure if I liked or not:**

Cara DeLevigne. Lets get this straight, the villain was boring as shit, but I don't think it's her fault. I mean she was pretty much hired to look supernatural and sexy in weird costumes and she did exactly as asked, not sure if she could've pulled off a more nuanced antagonist, but I don't blame her.

The Joker. Well, to Jared Letos credit, he completely disappeared into the character, yet didn't try to do Heath Ledger or Jack Nicholson. I wasn't really hugely impressed or ""feeling"" the Joker, until the scene where they stole the chopper and he was spraying bullets with his golden AK and laughing like a maniac. I hope we get to see him like this in the next installments, rather than being predictable in strip clubs.

Ike Barinholtz: Due to his comedic past it was jarring to see him at first, but he actually did quite well in the role and I was a bit impressed. 

**Things I didn't like:**

Harley Quinn looked and sounded like she belonged in the Purge movies, which I guess was kinda the point, but the geek in me questions why is she even needed in the suicide squad when her superpower is being okay in hand to hand combat and completely crazy. (If some people complain about Black Widow in Avengers, this is like 10 times less logical, I know it's a comic book movie and things like this shouldn't bother me but I disliked the character so I'm looking for extra excuses to not like her)

The flashback with Joker and Harley swimming in the goo, completely broke the pacing and didn't really offer anything groundbreaking in terms of character development.

The Villain was uninteresting 

Looks like the creative minds behind DCEU saw the latest X-Men film and decided they need to up the game in the disaster porn area to keep up. I have no problem with this, if the next movies are set in a post apocalyptic world, but didn't they destroy like half the world in this movie and nobody seemed to give a shit?

I want to know what Boomerangs deepest desire is! Goddamnit Enchantress. (I was expecting for them to go for a beer gag there and was so disappointed when they just skipped him)

**Summary**

Overall it was somewhat enjoyable but not very memorable movie. So fits the DCEU movie saga very well. I am looking forward to the Batman thing though, I'm enjoying Ben Affleck in the role immensely. It kinda felt like sometimes the movie was tongue in cheek and sometimes it wasn't. I feel like they should've gone full retard or stayed more serious, given the premise of the movie. But I guess they'd run into trouble with the tone if they want to tie this movie closely to the other DCEU films that are not comedies.

d66pzhl,"below average movie agree with the critics. I only liked Deadshot and Amanda waller. I hated Harley Quinn her dialogues were so cringeworthy and her mannerisms did not seem like good acting. The croc,boomerang,katana did not even needed to be in the movie.very very poorly written,edited and directed.DC needs to seriously improve the writing and editing of their movies.The villain totally sucked.",4w86a7
d66rcxy,"I... uh. Think the summary is wrong.

Anyways, it was an alright movie. I went to see it with two friends, and that's probably the only reason I was good with it. Lots of plot holes, a ton of unexplained stuff, dry humor. Also, the fuck is Killer Croc's design.

That being said it was at least a tad entertaining. It's a good beer and pizza movie if nothing else. They knew what they were trying for, and hit a low bar. Then again, the bar was pretty low after BvS, so... I don't know. Maybe they should stop hiring Zach Snyder.",4w86a7
d66w43f,"This movie is certainly an improvement over Batman vs Superman because it's not a snorefest. It's enjoyable, actually good acting, and it features interesting characters.

They had something special there. Too bad it was wasted away into a mess of a movie. The plot was a mess, the editing was a mess, the villain was a mess, the character development was a mess. 

The name of the movie is Suicide Squad, but it's like it's only Deadshot and Harley (Will Smith and Margot Robbie were awesome in their roles though). Which is ironic because they get a pretty poor exposition too, but at least they get some exposition unlike Katana, Captain Boomerang, Killer Croc, etc. These characters were just... there. Frustrating. Not to mention El Diablo, which is the perfect example of the mess the character development is.

I didn't like Gangsta Joker. All cringe showing and no action. Even if his scenes weren't cut, I'm still not sure if I would like him.

Viola Davis is perfect as Amanda Weller, by the way. We all should focus on this. She was scarier than Joker, Enchantress, Enchantress' brother, all together.

In general it's a mess, but I think it will ressonate with audiences better than BvS.

PS Edit: Another point I wanted to make is how disjointed and jarring the actual artstyle and sound mixing is from the marketing campaign and trailers. I know that what we were expecting was a darker and more serious movie, but the colorful and punk setting that the marketing campaign showed was what I personally wanted (c'mon, it's based on a Saturday morning cartoon). It was something unique and eye-catching and it was the kind of thing a blockbuster movie needed. I assumed the movie was following something similar, but it's like they tried to slap that on and forgot about it for most of the movie. Bohemian Rhapsody and You Don't Own Me felt so out of place actually, they didn't strike a chord. On the other hand, I could do with something dark and serious, and less pop references, but nothing is actually dark and serious. Don't take me wrong, the movie is pretty nice looking, but it lacked a proper art vision. It wasn't neither dark and serious or punk and colorful. It was a mix of both and in the end it didn't work exactly how it should have. It's not a flaw per se, but it's another special thing they wasted away. 

The poster is gorgeous - I enjoyed it more than the actual movie.",4w86a7
d67cgsu,"They chopped this movie the fuck up, and it's painfully obvious to even the most casual moviegoer. The movie just does not make sense narratively from moment one. All this marketing about how Ayer is the ultimate actors director, and how he pulled all those amazing emotions out. The first 30 minutes gave me fucking Whiplash. It was like a music video montage.


MARVEL IS SUCCEEDING ON THE STRENGTH OF THEIR CHARACTERS YOU DUMB CORPORATE FUCKS. How are they not seeing that? People are invested in Iron Man, they're invested in Captain America. It's not fucking rocket science. When people are calling for two directors cuts in a row, it's time to look inside the boardroom.",4w86a7
d67fr4q,"The movie was all over the place. It wasn't great or good but it wasn't horrifyingly terrible either. It was okay. 

The humor was terrible though. There were so many scenes where you could tell they expected the audience to laugh but everyone in the theater was stone cold silent. I hated that they did nothing with the Enchantress' face during that scene where she's supposed to look so powerful. It ended up making her look basic instead of looking like a fearsome witch. 

There was way too much set up for what I'm guessing will be a movie with the Joker and Harley, it took away from the development of the ""squad"". As a result the rah rah friendship thing seemed contrived because there wasn't much development of said friendship. The only members of the squad that got airtime or personality development were Deadshot and Harley, and Diablo to an extent. 

It was an okay movie but there were definitely some failings. ",4w86a7
d67in5p,Assault on Arkham was a better Suicide Squad movie. ,4w86a7
d67nw1q,"For me the movie was just decent if I'm comparing it with other superhero movies. The major issue in this movie is that individually the characters are good but there is no 'team' here


**Positives:**


-The actors worked really well in their roles, particularly Robbie and Smith


-The tone of the film was fine, they were right to make it lighthearted and reshoot to add humour



**Negatives:**


-The music was all safe picks, I don't know how many times I've seen House of the Rising Sun used as a backdrop to criminality


-The first part of the movie was as an information dump to introduce us to the characters, I felt it would have been better if we were introduced to the characters training as a disfunctional team, so we get a feel for them and a few laughs


-The plot was extremely formulaic: superhero team recruited -> big bad introduced -> team go into action -> plans go awry -> final boss battle


-There was no team dynamic here beyond Deadshot and Harley, at one point El Diablo says, ' I've already lost one family, I'm not going to lose another.' The guy had like two interactions with the team before this and they weren't exactly buddy buddy, by the time they are at the bar they are all a big family apparently? Did I miss some scenes? 


-Jared Leto's Joker is ok, but he's just a gangster and almost like a supervillain poser: I'm a bad guy I like to drive fast through traffic, I'm a bad guy I like to feel depressed in a room full of knives and guns, I'm a bad guy because I randomly shot my lackey.


-As for the Joker's appearances. The Joker is in this plenty, between every other scene he's raiding another place and in between these scenes he's overshadowing the plot because you know he's coming by reminders like the text message 

**The little things:** 


-No need to tie this in with the Justice League to be honest, don't overshadow the main characters with known heroes


-Plot hole: Harley's explosive device was disabled and yet she just went back to prison, why? Was the free espresso machine that good? 


-Deadshot's mask: Will Smith's character has a really cool mask, but this super secret assassin refuses to wear it. In my opinion this has nothing to do with the plot and everything to do with the actor wanting their face to be shown. It's a shame really because revealing his face could have been used as another bonding moment this movie sorely needed",4w86a7
d6835uy,"This is a joke of a movie and if things play out as they should, jared Leto should be competing with jesse eisenberg for a razie at the end of the year. Ughhh what a cringe fest",4w86a7
d68cmg9,"I was pleasantly surprised, loved the characters.",4w86a7
d68cznd,"Overall, I thought it was enjoyable enough.  So many easy things could have been fixed as far as the plot goes.  The following is a stream of consciousness rant after leaving the theater:


* They throw Enchantress in with the Suicide Squad though she has nothing really in common with the group.  An alternate option should have been to start the movie with Waller going to the joint chiefs and saying, “meta-humans are the new weapons, now we have ours,” and then showing off that her enchantress can bend space and time to be used as a weapon in whatever shows up next.  Then when Enchantress goes rogue, it would be a classic “man (woman) tries to yield a power he can’t control” story.  Then it would make more sense that she has to put together or activate the suicide squad to undo her mistake.

*Alternatively, she could have said they would use the Enchantress to control the Suicide Squad, which then would have given our anti-heroes a real challenge to have to tap into their ‘true hero/inner goodness’ to overcome her mind control.  They instead did it for like 5 seconds before their climactic battle.

*This evil undead army shows up to confront the squad when they arrive in Midway.  We have no insight where they came from.  After nearly half of the army is dead, they give us a scene showing the Enchantress making her army.  Why not just re-arrange those two scenes?  Then we see Enchantress standing by with maybe a dozen of her undead soldiers.  Then there is another cut scene where she has maybe 6 standing on the steps.  Then the Squad shows up and there are none.  I don’t know why.  Oh, there where like 3 in the sewer standing guard though.

*Enchantress’ brother starts as a bad ass.  He destroys a few bystanders, then a subway train, builds up his strength and starts taking out Humvees and helicopters.  That all looked pretty good.  He breaks her link to the voodoo heart (which somehow still ultimately kills her) without any explanation. Then in the climax of the battle he is unable to lay a hand on anybody.  Couldn’t they have at least given a reason like he didn’t want to damage her end-of-the-world machine, or his energy was drained by some other thin plot device?  And the inferno guy releases his inner mayan warrior for a pretty good battle – he breathes fire into the bad guy which seems like a pretty good way to end him.  Instead, they go with a bomb that has about a 10ft blast radius.  Keep in mind tanks, subway trains, army artillery can’t touch him, but a bomb that can’t kill the croc destroys him.

*The Enchantress is blowing up satellites out of the sky.  Raining fire and doom from the sky, but Harley Quinn and a baseball bat are enough to take her off her game.  Then, for some reason, she disarms all of them because NOW she means business.  So the disarmed squad is ready to face their doom, Harley tricks her into letting her guard down and steals the heart – reasonable for a superhero movie.  Then, even though disarmed seconds ago, they pull a good sized bomb and Harley’s gun to set off a charge at the base of the end-of-the-world weapon. Couldn’t defeating the witch have been reason enough for it to disarm?

*Flag then has his uneventful crisis of killing the one he loves by destroying the heart.  Happy day, she’s not really dead.  No one really sad that Midway was destroyed, but disproportionate grief is pretty typically in these situations.


Other not plot stuff that took me out of the movie:
*I am no military buff, but Flag held his guns like a pansy.

*There was a distracting woman wearing dark eye shadow in the background of Deadshot’s gun-range scene who is no bigger than 5’4” 130lbs.  They maybe show her again outside Boomerang’s cell at the end.  That was dumb.

*I agree with others that the Joker was forced into the narrative.


Why can’t the writers just consult Reddit to make their movies better?

d66hdgh,"Things to make the movie better and also things i noticed:

Cut Katana.

Cut Capt Boomerang (how did he even make the grade? He's just a bank robber, there are real life criminals worse than him. (But if the supernatural stuff was cut from the movie then he looks more relevant so if that was cut he could stay tbh).

Enchantress. The women that can teleport to Tehran and back but can't beat captain boomerang with his knives or Harley Quinn with a bat. 

Enchantress' brother. Causes mayhem but when against the Squad he's about at accurate as Stormtroopers with his attacks.

The whole blueprint of the script. This was a good chance to get away from the typical final battle superhero movie and just develop characters and team work. They could have had fights between themselves before coming together as a team.

Hold back on the gods. Just like i thought Batman vs Superman would suffer, it's hard to make a believable contest between god like people and mere mortals. And this is why it raises a lot of questions like ""why does enchantress not just...."" Because she is so power, etc. Iron man movie started out with just human vs human with exo-suits and it was excellent. I think the 'bad guy"" would only need to be a terrorist... It's their first fight we aren't wanting this 'saving the world' crap already, nobody required this to validate how good they are. 

I thought if the supernatural stuff was exempt from this film and replaced the enchantress with say a terrorist or something mortal  then it would have been much better and kept some people like harley quinn more valuable in a battle perspective.... I mean she's a woman with a bat at the end of the day. 

For the above reason I'd probably just cut or at least tone down Diablo. I nearly laughed out loud when he turned into a flaming skeleton, haha wtf?. His powers are a bit x-men-esq.

Anyone else notice how fast headshot read that file folder? 30 secs? Lol. 

Rick Flag just walks about with a pocket full of deadshots letters does he?

Why did enchantress not die when her heart was getting stabbed when she 'bolted' but Rick Flag only need crush it to kill her, or at least defeat her?

Scuba gear? Where'd that come from? 

Eh, Flash... Batman.... Do you want to lend us a hand? the world as we know it is ending- Another reason you don't have apocalyptical powered bad guys straight off the bat.

Biggest scumbag in movie was batman sexually abusing and unconscious Harley Quinn lol.

You should have all died in that first helicopter crash. 

How did the joker survive?

In the beginning when Waller is eating that endless steak and talking to that other guy i wondered ""why does this guy not know that the joker and Harley quinn were the king and queen of the city or anything else she's telling him for that matter? Has he awoken from a comma, is he from a different planet?"" Lol.

I really wanna see that joker and Harley Quinn back story. 


---------------------------------


So over all. There has to not be such a gulf in the abilities of characters in the movies. Captain boomerang vs enchantress.... Come on there's too much of a gulf there. It's the reason that Hawkeye is so irrelevant in the avengers movies, he's limited on what impact he can really do. Heck, if you put enchantress in Star Wars it would make Darth Vader, the jedi etc look awful and irrelevant so it just shows you how important this is.

Unfortunately, the genies out of the bottle (lol) and we're gna have to endure the whole world being saved in ever subsequent movie now and knowing in our heart of hearts that Harley Quinn, the joker, deadshot and Batman are all really insignificant in this 'metahuman' world. Sigh.


Edit: batman may have performed CPR instead of kissing HQ, this probs makes more sense haha. I thought it was a kiss. I must have missed this as i was turning my head every 2 secs to my friend to pick flaws in the movie lol",4w86a7
d66i3cs,"As a big DC fan, I'm pretty disappointed. I do think the critics were way too harsh on this - there's no way it's as bad as any of the Fantastic 4 films, nor is it significantly worse than any of the lesser Marvel films - but there was a ton of wasted potential here.

The Good:

* Outside of Enchantress & Rick Flag, the cast was excellent.
* So stoked to see more of Leto's Joker - I really hope they let him go wild in a solo Batman film.
* Margot Robbie was perfect as Harley. Absolutely perfect. I can't wait for the spin off film they announced.
* They finally got a decent mix of fun and grit/seriousness. Some of the humor was too on-the-nose, but I would absolutely watch this again. I definitely can't say the same about BvS or Man of Steel.
* All the cameos were great and brought me back to the Batman & Justice League cartoons I watched as a kid that got me hooked on DC.
* I was pleasantly surprised by El Diablo - he was one of the stand outs along with Harley, Deadshot, and the Joker.
* The bar scene was excellent and probably my favorite moment in the film.
* The nods to the comics were freaking great. Really hope we get to see Harley in her harlequin costume sometime in the future.

The Bad:

* Rick Flagg and Enchantress were garbage. Both of the actors were terrible and the characters weren't interesting in the least (not to mention Flag had one of the dumbest lines I've heard in a comic book film during the ending scene).
* The script and editing were terrible - we don't need 4 introductions for each character to start the film, and there was WAY too much exposition.
* It definitely felt like it was hampered by the PG-13 rating and should have been allowed to go after an R.
* The ending fight was terrible. I know nearly all superhero flicks have poor third acts, but this was truly awful. The slow motion was laughably bad.
* Too much pop music. Some of it worked, but it felt like it was in every single scene at the beginning and became really distracting and pulled me out of the film.
* Killer Croc looked cool, and was cool when he growled and stuff, but they gave him some really bad dialogue. He should have been their version of Groot (in a dark, twisted way) and communicated primarily through his eyes or with gestures.
* Slipknot. At least give him some kind of introduction and have him interact with the squad.

For all of it's flaws the film was definitely fun and entertaining. That being said, there was so much wasted potential here that I can't help but feel even more disappointed than I was with BvS. I mean, BvS was straight trash and took a ton of will power to sit through, but I don't think there's much they could have done to salvage it's flaws. This, on the other hand, had numerous flaws that would have been resolved by simply not rushing the film. Had they spent more than 6 weeks on the script and reigned in some of the ambition it would have been pretty good. If they'd have taken their time and introduced these characters in solo Batman/Flash films this would have been excellent. What we got was a ton of potential down the drain in a cheap attempt to catch up with Marvel.

I'd rate it a 5.5/10",4w86a7
d6704i2,"Can we talk about Killer Croc? Let's talk about Killer Croc...

Killer Croc was hilariously awful. In the comic book Killer Croc is a formidable opponent. Even in more realistic, dark adaptations where he's more human than animal he's an [absolute beast](http://www.kilencedik.hu/galeria/gal/Cikkek/Olorin/20081125_joker/joker4.jpg). It was clear that Suicide Squad tried to ride the line between [unrealistic](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/arkhamcity/images/4/4b/Killer_Croc_AK.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20151223111957) and [realistic](http://tgchan.org/kusaba/draw/src/131016698360.png) renditions of the character, and that's fine.  

However, Suicide Squad's Croc was almost completely useless. They tried to imply he was super strong, but appeared only have have slightly enhanced strength compared to anyone in the team. The most significant display of strength we even see from him is him throwing one of the Aztec Zombie Creatures to the ground and bitting it. So if he's not really that strong, what else does he bring to the table? Well, he can swim really well and hold his breath underwater for a long time. Does it matter? Nope. In the final act one of the Navy Seals ends up swimming to get a bomb, plants it, and sacrifices himself. Killer Croc just sort of tags along. Even though he's a better swimmer and could have maybe escape the blast radius, thus completely removing Scott Eastwood's absolutely ridiculous suicide bombing. So Killer Croc was even more useless there. 

Killer Croc is also supposed to be [insanely intimidating](http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/61625/4717495-batman-vs-killer-croc-earth-one-1.jpg). He's barely human, that's what makes him such a formidable opponent for Batman. Well in Suicide Squad he was of average height, wasn't very bulky, and had a bit of a [Dad bod](http://video.newsserve.net/v/20150515/5578363-Suicide-Squad-Check-Out-Killer-Croc-Full.jpg). 

But you wanna know what the final nail in the coffin was? He was seriously a punchline generator. Anytime he spoke something cringeworthy came out of his mouth for the purpose of comedic relief. And at the end of the film we are treated with the imagery of Killer Croc lounging in bed, in the sewer, eating a cheeseburger and watching a music videos of girls twerking (no, I am not shitting you).

I don't remember anything that happened in this movie. Nothing. It left no impact on me. Say what you will about BvS, at least that movie made you say ""That was dumb,"" or ""That fight scene was badass."" With this, I don't remember a single exchange of dialogue, a single action scene, or a single ludicrously bad moment. This was just DC's lousy attempt to make a Marvel movie - bad jokes and quips, poorly done villains with an army of disposable gray CGI henchmen, and a blue beam that shoots into the sky.

That said, it's not all bad. I DID like the irreverent tone of the movie, compared to the idiotically self-serious tone of BvS. What can I say, I prefer a dumb yet self-aware movie to a dumb movie that tries and fails to be smart. I'm curious to see how, or even IF, people defend this movie - this is not a movie with excessive Jesus imagery, Arthurian symbolism, or anything resembling subtext. There's nothing to ""get"" here - this is just a dumb movie trying to be edgy.

Overall, I think this movie is going to be forgotten in a week or two. I don't think it's going to be anyone's favorite superhero movie, but I don't think it'll be anyone's least favorite, either.

Blindly supporting a brand just because you have this misguided sense of loyalty towards them is not a good idea, especially when they've yet to prove their worth in a post-The Dark Knight trilogy world.

Demand that the movies get treated with respect and you'll actually start getting good films instead of wasting your energy making petitions about how a fucking review aggegator site is apart of some hidden agenda. You're acting exactly the way they want you to.

The only person I enjoyed in the film was Will Smith the rest were meh also wtf is up with Diablo ""I won't let my new family die"" You've known them for 12 hours and you've spoken to them 4 times, no one acted like a villain.",4w86a7
d64uflr,This movie was like expecting that Christmas present you wanted all year ... Then it's time to open presents under the tree only to find socks.,4w86a7
d64y8er,"I enjoyed it for the most part, a hell of a lot more than BvS, but a few things kind of bothered me.

* Leto Joker sounded like Jim Carrey's Grinch.

 I feel like Leto has something with this Joker, but the script was absolutely giving him nothing. I want to see some more of this Joker, but they need to give him something else to do than pine after Harley. 90% of Jokers see Harley as a pet or something they can kick around, here he's all about her and it's kind of weird.

* Boomerang is awesome, but underused.

 Captain Boomerang is a long standing member of the squad and has appeared in every version of the comic. For the most part the character is great in this film, but they don't use him to his full potential. For one his comic character is an asshole who never shuts his mouth even in a fight he is talking shit left and right, it's part of his charm, this doesn't really show up in the film. Two, they sacrificed his manipulative nature in favor of making him more ""likable"". He still pulls the ""the bombs are a lie"" thing with Slipknot, but here it looks like he just got lucky instead of actually tricking Slipknot into setting off the bomb. Lastly, he throws his boomerangs a total of three times (I counted). He has access to an awesome ranged weapon and instead he uses it like a pair of daggers and is constantly seen trying to get into close combat rather than utilizing the damn boomerangs like they should be. I would accept the argument that it would be more realistic to limit the number of boomerangs he had on him if it wasn't for the fact that Ayer wanted to make the comic bookiest movie ever and the fact that Deadshot has infinite bullets and no need to reload outside of his ""tryout"" scene.

* Why was Katana here?

 I'll admit I'm not familiar with this character, I'm a big SS comic fan and I don't recall her being there. She isn't really used in combat save for capturing Boomerang when he runs and saving him at the end. She doesn't really interact with anyone in the squad or outside of it. All that really happens is they tell a 5 second story about her that doesn't add anything to the plot.

* Diablo knows these guys for a couple of hours and declares them his new family who he is willing to die for.

 I didn't really mind this one, but it just confuses me. He has a couple of hours interaction with this group, two of his conversations involve two members talking shit to him, and his third conversation involves Harley basically telling him to grow a pair. It's just a little baffling why he's suddenly instantly in family mode with these guys.",4w86a7
d64yfqu,"Overall a pretty meh film, but I loved how blatant the scenes of exposition were in this movie, it felt like I was right there in the writer's room.

""Eh, we haven't said much of anything about the chick with the sword, let's have a scene where she's crying with her soul sword""

""Everyone having fun at the bar scene? Let's go into the backstory of flaming ink over there""

""Mr Boomerang hasn't had any characterization, let's have his fantasy being with his wife? Girlfriend? Doesn't matter""

""What about the crocodile? He's like our Groot, people will love him""",4w86a7
d64z3xi,"What I found really strange was putting as much popular songs as they could in the movie. It worked in Guardians of the Galaxy because it tied to the story, it was Star Lord mix tape, but here I just found it annoying. I wanted to really like it but it was all over the place and had some massive plotholes. Where the fuck did the marines pull out their tanks to go underwater? Why did Waller needed to be extracted? the entire city found time to evacuate but for some reason she couldn't even though she has choppers at her disposal. Also there is a city with some supernatural world ending shit going on, but Batman, The Flash (who we know is currently active) or Wonderwoman, couldn't be bothered to check out what is the problem? And why the fuck is Bruce Wayne asking Waller for info on meta humans? World greatest detective really doesn't apply to movie Batman (he couldn't even find a boat in BvS) Also the members of the squad are supposed to be ""the worst of the worst"" But we only saw Killer Croc defending himself against people that attacked him, El Diablo turned himself in and was a good guy the whole movie, Deadshot was a hero pretending he was a big bad villain, Captain boomerang was a bank robber (the worst of the worst) Harley was the only one that could maybe fit that description the rest were luke warm bad at best. And Katana could have been cut from the movie entirely and her random ass scene crying hysterically was so out of place. I can't say if the Joker was good or bad since we barely see him though so I can give him a chance with more shit to do in the future.",4w86a7

d650wmz,"You know what this movie reminded me of, Transformers 3.  Ravaged city, merged 2/3 act, ""good guy"" becomes bad, model turned actress, 3rd in the series, a well known villain thrown in there to make the plot more interesting, weird morphing characters that you can't really tell what's happening, inconsistent scene jumps, filled with action but no substance.  I really could keep going.  And I wouldn't be at all surprised if the scores are near idential for RT/Metacritic/IMDB. 


Point is, I enjoyed watching it. I probably won't watch it again, and I'll have it on as background noise when it's on cable.  ",4w86a7

d654dz6,"Nothing was fleshed out so it lacked any real weight. 

Also is no one gonna talk about the real hero? The dude that blew himself up to detonate the bomb? The only one that actually got down the first half of the team's name?!

Also, needed to be darker. And no I'm not part of the weird crowd that complained about how dark BvS was. I like dark. I hate most Marvel movies because of how campy they are. I want to be gut punched with feelings like in TDK and even TDKR. Hell, even Watchmen.

d65u0wo,"So these are my thoughts on the me movie. 

Overall I'm majorly let down by the movie. 

Pros: I really liked the interpretations of the characters, they were very different than what I was expecting, but I liked them. They made the joker into a gangster, very different from Heath Ledger or Hamill, but it worked for me. Will Smith just played himself as headshot, but it's classic Will Smith and I can't help but not love him. Jai Courtney was actually good in the movie, not great but good. Amanda Waller was cool, I liked how ruthless she was. Katana was really cool, loved that she p much spoke Japanese the entire time. Harleyquin stole the movie for me, she was perfect. I loved how crazy she came off, she really was the wild card and I didn't know what she was going to do next. The rest of the squad was cool too, but nothing out of this world. 

Cons:  So the characters were fine, but the story was very basic and simple. A very very very generic and silly villain. I really really wanted to love Enchantress, but she just came of as silly. At times, the movie had cartoon logic and it completely killed any momentum it had going. Like some scenes legit felt like I was watching a cartoon, but in a bad way (looking at you El Diablo). It was a very standard basic movie with a simple and at times too silly plot, that had wacky characters. Like there isn't that one badass moment that made me go ""oh yeah that was badass.""

Overall I'm letdown because movie looked to be very unique with a lot of out of this world ideas. However it turned out to have one of the most basic and run of the mill plots that I have ever seen. We have another movie that yet again has another giant lazer shooting up to the sky and they have to save world. Ugh fuck that. I was expecting them to be doing Amanda Waller's dirty work, and not just standard Marvel shit. 

If you've seen the trailers, you've seen a better shorter version of the movie. 

P.S. don't expect the Joker to be a real character in the movie. He's there for about 10 min, basically an extended cameo",4w86a7
d65xxxl,"I cracked up when Rick Flag yelled ""her heart's been destroyed, now we can finish her!"" at the end. Parts just seemed really corny and I thought the whole story line about Enchantress was lackluster. Entertaining for stretches but the whole film was way too long",4w86a7
d660ere,"I enjoyed more Harley and Deadshot introductions that the rest of the movie.

It was basically - those are the bad/good guys, here is some short back story, now lets get them to the magical beam in the middle of the city while they fight the monsters on their way there. It felt rushed and without an actual story.",4w86a7
d66881w,I miss Heath Ledger :(,4w86a7
d66b217,"I didn't really care for the movie.  The plot and story telling were pretty awful.

* Margot Robbie was the only person who should play Harley Quinn.  They at least got that right.

* Outside of Robbie's and Smith's characters, none of the characters were that great.

* The bad guys who turn ""good"" really have no reason to be good.  It's clear they lack sympathy and compassion, yet they randomly have it after all this backstory we're given showing otherwise. Everything goes back to normal anyways.

* Didn't really care for Leto as the Joker.  All I could focus on was the teeth and how they just didn't fit his mouth.

* A lot felt like ""let's put these big name actors in a movie, give them simple one liners, and play music people have heard"".",4w86a7
d66epmy,"That movie was incredibly dissapointing. I can't tell if it was overacting, the dialogue, or both that ruined it. The Joker, Rick Flagg, Enchantress, and Diablo all had extremely corny lines and showed very poor acting choices. Will Smith played a good Will Smith, and the daughter in the movie was awful at acting. Harley Quinn was good except for some bad dialogue and there were some things her character did that just didnt make sense for her to do. I wish I could chalk it up to too high expectations but it really isnt. Bad movie. Rotten Tomatoes score is accurate.",4w86a7
d66g3po,"I hated Leto portrayal of the character. Or maybe I should say: I really hate the way this Joker is writen. Like someone said, is a generic gangster.


Overall the movie is bad, poorly edited, with brief moments of cool ideas (like the first scenes with Enchantress), but with an horrible story that made no sense. Of course the movie ended with a few redemptions and doing some clichés. Why did no one of them show off what makes them amazing? Boomerang was a joke, Croc was just a standard strong guy, Harley Queen only is good in using a pistol?


Man, those were two hours wasted.",4w86a7
d66gqq6,"I felt like the movie had little to no stakes and the emotional scenes did not have the emotional impact it wanted. I'm no writer or storyteller but i've been thinking of improvements that i think would make the movie better to me, and i'm gonna go ahead and dump my ideas here: 

1.  Enchantress and Brother switch roles.  Brother is the main antagonist.

2.  Brother cannot complete his weapon because whatever reason

3. Have Enchantress fight the SS during encounters with the minions.  The first encounter in the streets will leave her kind of defeated as she would under estimate the SS.  When she encounters them in the building, she will witness El Diablo's power and feels that he may be the key to completing Brother's weapon.  She teleports to Brother to report to him her findings and teleports back to capture Waller.

4.  Right after the bar scene, Enchantress interrupts the SS's break and abducts El Diablo and destroys the bar,  killing none of the SS but knocking them out.

5.  Have the SS come up with a plan to save El Diablo and complete their mission.

The ending battle:

1.  El Diablo is trapped by the powers of both Brother and Enchantress, and his power are being used to destroy different locations.  We would see fire instead.

2. The killer croc bomb plan is still a go, but this time, the goal is to use the bomb to destroy the weapon.

3. Deadshot will be sniping from a rooftop of another building to provide support with a high caliber rifle.

4.  Another fight scene with SS vs. Dual Wielding Enchantress and minions ensue.

5.  Flag is able to reach out to Moone, creating a power struggle between Moone and Enchantress to control the body, leaving the body vulnerable.

6. Katana slices Enchantress's chest cavity open, while she is immobile, to reveal her heart.

7. Katana removes the heart from her body as to not harm Moone's body and chucks it to Flag.

8. Enchantress regains control of the body.

9. Flag throws the heart into the line of sight of Deadshot because they need a high caliber bullet to destroy the heart completely; but as he is about the take the shot, Enchantress uses her powers to make him see his daughter in front of him.

10.  He overcomes the power of emotion, maybe screams out a line of dialogue like ""get out of my head!"". He takes the shot widowmaker style, which travels right through his fake daughter, and hits the heart of Enchantress, which kills her. 

11.  El Diablo eveolves into his final form, revealing his power and breaks free of his bonds, weakened by the death of enchantress, and attacks Brother.  

12. At this point the other members are still fighting minions.  Maybe highlighting some more cool shit Harley, Cpt. Boomerang, and Kitana can do.

13.  El Diablo goes out in a blaze of glory as he throws himself and Brother into the weapon as  the bomb underneath detonates.  Killing them both and destroying the weapon.

14. Minions return to human form and Moone is revealed to still be alive.

d66meqp,"So disappointed. So much potential, and most of wasted. Just like BvS. 

The team set up was terrible. I mean, how fucking hard is it to tell this story?

Waller has the idea for the team, the idea is shot down as too extreme, she preps them anyway because she's fucking Amanda Waller, THEN a crisis happens which needs immediate urgent action and she sends them in out of desperation. The ""team"" and Flagg/Waller then gets trapped (maybe you could play with magic here in that the city they are operating in gets blocked off from the rest of the world keep The Flash etc out), most are killed off, but they manage to band together and kill off the villain just by being more terrible and cutthroat then the actual bad guy. They go back to prison except Harley, who gets broken out by Leto's Joker playing an actual cameo (way more exciting and impactful than whatever the hell he was this movie).

d67a5xg,"Number one complaint is why did Captain boomerang come back aster he left the bar?

He had no motivation too, he did nothing in the final fight (Throwing a boomerang Drone doesn't count) and it would have legitimately been a better end his character.

I just want to add that I didn't really like the way they introduced the characters  backgrounds, i fucking hated the fact that the villain they were fighting was some super witch (way too strong for them, and frankly I just think the whole plot around the enchantress was stupid especially for this story), and the transition of thr characters from bad guys to good guys just seemed stupid to me.  Also at the end of the film that evil black chick had her fingers on the phone on top of some of the dudes faces.",4w86a7
d6856re,"Film was enjoyable at parts, and I thought it was vastly superior to BvS/MoS in pretty much everyway, but the action, villains and some of the cringe worthy jokes and editing during the Harley Quinn flashbacks really hindered this film, and some of the music in the film just felt crammed in for practically no reason other than trying to be the next Guardians of the Galaxy. Also, the fight with Enchantress and Incubis or whatever the fuck that guy was called was anti climatic and Jared Leto's Joker is complete shit.

Margot Robbie was great as Harley Quinn, but the script for her character was 50/50. She was either geniunely funny in some scenes, or a cringe inducing moron in others.",4w86a7
d68t3ow,I could not understand what Killer Croc was saying at all.,4w86a7
d68ubgg,"I understand that this would have been unlikely, but I seriously wish the marketing had made Slipknot into a badass. Make him him look like he had plenty of screen time, and make him seem as big as the rest of the cast, then BOOM, his head was immediately blown off, surprising the audience, and reinforcing the ""anybody can die and any time"" theme. Instead, everyone knew he was dead from the trailers, nobody liked him or cared, and his death appeared to serve no purpose.

 It could have been a ""Wake up, this movie is going to be bloodthirsty"" feel, but killing off someone that nobody cared about reinforced the feeling that nobody noteworthy would ever be in danger, because they were in the trailer. 

ps: I didn't really know anybody in the movie (before the trailers) other than Harley and Killer Croc. If the trailers had made Slipknot look like a big deal, I would have believed them. Sure, fans of the animated show know his purpose, but the majority of the audience wouldn't. Instead, it just made the notable guys feel... ironically safer. ",4w86a7
d6915oo,"The key problem in this movie (for me), apart from the incoherent editing, terrible dialogue, and complete waste of the Joker, was the scale of the threat and the behavior of the criminals.

Why the fuck is the SS fighting some world-ending enemy? That's a job for Superman/Flash. We've already established that Flash would show up to stop some Australian bank robber, why wouldn't he just blitz into Enchantress's lair and grab her heart in a femtosecond during an event that would clearly be instant world news? 

Why would Deadshot hesitate to kill Harley? He might want to be a better man for his kid, but he doesn't seem to be stopping his murder activities anytime soon (they are useful for trig homework though I guess). Why did Boomerang return? He's a colossally selfish character. Why did Diablo consider everyone his family after one drink in a bar? Their behavior is bizarre given the characters.

Waller is an 'ends justify the means' person, and is very hard-edged, but she literally just murders a bunch of FBI/government agents doing their jobs and Flagg is just 'that's fine?' Nobody at all mentions that Enchantress is a threat of Waller's own making? At all? June Moore is such a shitty archaeologist that on her first dig she finds some ancient bottle and immediately picks it up and breaks it? This is just lazy for no reason.

Establishing the SS as a group to fight Superman-level characters makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Yeah, Harley's bat is going to make Zod reconsider his plans. As is Slipknot 'the man who can climb anything's' grappling hook. The SS is tailor made for heist movies, and that's where they shine - why wasn't this done here? The animated Assault on Arkham movie did a better job at establishing a team, and had better inclusion of the Joker (actually showing how abusive/fucked up the relationship with Harley is). 

Hell, the animated series did it better as a one-off episode 'Task Force X' - having the squad infiltrate Justice League headquarters to steal a machine. Their criminal/theft skills actually matter, and you got the humor of them having to sneak past actual god-level characters. They beat a C-list response team but then are confronted with Martian Manhunter, who they in no way have any chance of actually defeating, and Deadshot kills one member to cover their escape with no hesitation or remorse despite having some earlier bonding with them. It's interesting, fun, true to the characters, and shows how a team of people who are far less powerful than their opponents might work to pull one over on them.

Finally, very tonally different music playing one after another in rapid succession? I get WB wanted to GotG this, but Christ, apart from House of the Rising Sun (which I thought fit the setting of Belle Reve introduction in the Louisiana swamps), the music did nothing but take me out of the scenes.

God, this movie was such a waste of time, money, and talent. How a major movie-making studio can spend hundreds of millions of dollars and get this is beyond me.",4w86a7
d69amre,"What a mess. I'm shocked and so disappointed with this movie. There are some really good elements in this movie but it's been butchered by Warner Bros. An non exsistant plot, awful editing, wasted characters, a joke of a villain and constant exposition completely ruins the film good qualities. Easily the worse of the DC movies so far, even worse than Batman v Superman.

**The Squad**
Harley Quinn: I was rather disappointed with her. Margot Robbie was great but Harley never felt crazy enough and her relationship with Joker was all wrong. Her jokes fell flat and it felt pointless to have her on the team. 

Deadshot: Will Smith was great in this movie but he never felt like Deadshot. He was just Will Smith with lots of guns. He was likeable and got some of the films biggest laughs while he sold his emotional scenes well but Deadshot did nothing to distinguish himself from the dozen of the other same characters Will Smith has played.

Amanda Waller: Viola Davis was amazing and completely smashed this role. Threatening, intelligent and witty, Viola was the films MVP and she commanded my attention whenever she stepped on screen. Loved her and hope to see more of her in DC movies.

Boomerang: Props to David Ayer for making Jai Courtney interesting to watch. He made me laugh and I was invested in the character but I feel that alot of his stuff was cut and that the film should have pushed how much of an asshole he is. An R rating would have allowed that. Also, like Harley he felt useless to the team and I found it hard to believe that he survived some of the battles in this film.

El Diablio: I'm mixed on him. Jay Hernandez was great in this role but Diablio's arc felt rushed and I didn't buy that he suddenly wanted to sacrifice himself for the squad (Who he's only known for a day at the most). His final form was pretty goofy and came out of nowhere.

Killer Croc: Had his moments but didn't really do anything until the final act. The actor did a good job with his movements and facial expressions and his line saying that he's beautiful got a big laugh. Makeup was great on him

Rick Flag: Bland and boring. Did an alright job I guess but was just a boring character and I think he should have been killed by Enchantress to raise the stakes.

Katana: Useless and underused. When I saw the trailers I was certain she was gonna be steal the movie but no she has 5 lines and  just stands in the background for most of the movie. If she wasn't in the squad, nothing would have changed at all. Actress was fine but just wasn't given anything to do

Slipknot: Might as well have worn a neon sign saying: I WILL DIE. Useless and but served more of a purpose in the plot than Katana.

Enchantress/ June Moon: What a joke. She first seemed cool and had an interesting design but her plan and motives were idiotic to say the least and she was way too powerful for the squad to handle. June Moon just stood there and cried and made no impact on me but Enchantress made an impact on me for all the wrong reason. She's everything you don't want in a villain: Unthreatning, Dumb, a pushover when dealing with the heroes and has a bland and stupid plan. A portal in the sky? Wow really original! Her bizarre dancing at the end will be a meme I guarantee it. 

*OTHER CHARACTERS

Joker: Yes his design was stupid and Yes he will never match Ledger but I like Leto's Joker. I just wish I had seen more of him. I don't like that his relationship with Harley had been redone so it's less abusive (Probably to appeal to all the 14 year old Harley fans who will dress up as her for Halloween) but Leto's joker was fun and I feel like if so many of his scenes hadn't been cut then I would have liked him even more. Him interrogating Griggs was great.

Incubus: Dumb design, awful CGI and was just stupid. Him absorbing the civilians in the subway was unsettling but there was nothing interesting about the character and he seemed like he was there for nothing other than to destroy helicopters.

Griggs: A fun character. Ike Barinholtz did a great job and his jokes mainly landed.

GQ: As bland as Rick Flag and even more forgettable than Katana. Nothing Interesting about him in the slightest

**PLOT**
A mess. A complete mess. Rampant plotholes (How is Waller alive after having tentacles enter her HEAD? Is GQ dead when he set off the bomb and if not, what happened to him? How does dynamite destroy a magic spell? What was Enchantress even doing with that beam of light? Why is Enchantress's heart in Waller's apartment not a military bunker that is secure? Why does Enchantress engage in a knife fight when she can easily remove the Squad's weapons? How do the Squad, Joker and Waller all survive their helicopter crashes?) take away from the movie hugely. I think Enchantress was too big a threat for the Squad. She could clearly kill them all easily. She and her brother were fucking up Midway city, killing Hundreds but where was Flash? Where was Wonder Woman? The threat was too big and I really felt like most of the squad wasn't needed for the mission except Deadshot, El Diablio and possibly Katana. The plot should have been a heist or an assassination. It shouldn't have been that huge in stakes.

**EDITING**
A disaster. Just awful. Confusing, muddled and it was way too frantic during the (bland and repetitive) fight scenes. I shocked how something so poorly edited was released in theaters. It's obvious that Warner have slashed this film to oblivion and we're watching the rotting carcass of a possibly great film.

**OTHER NOTES**
So much exposition that it's not funny. CGI is decent for the most part. 40% of the jokes hit and song choices range from witty and fitting to obnoxious and overbearing. Original soundtrack is great; Purple Lamborghini is one of my faves. 

**CONCLUSION**
A mess overall but it has it's moments. I feel if Warner had faith and didn't butcher this movie then it would be a huge success but that didn't happen. I truly believe there is a great movie in Suicide Squad. Shame you have to look through some much crap to find it

d64z0ne,"I just got back from this movie, I'd say I overall enjoyed it to some extent but no more than I did BvS. This can not continue in the DCEU. If this happens to Wonder Woman its over. This movie was just all over the place and I heard the people behind me after it was over say they didn't understand what was happening. I feel like this movie as well as BvS were messy and bloated at times, but you can truly see the potential for great films in both of them. There is a kick-ass awesome movie in there somewhere. Some of the visuals in this were seriously stunning. Enchantress was so creepy and the other costumes were top notch. I really hope WB can turn this around because I love DC and really want it to succeed just as well as Marvel. ",4w86a7
d671yhu,"Yeah this was bad. The opening was so sloppy, all the characters introductions went on far too long and were edited awfully. Here's an idea, how about we learn about the characters through their actions and dialogue, instead of a giant exposition dump at the beginning of the film. Batman is there so they can put Batman in the trailer, Ben Affleck looked like he didn't really want to be there and had absolutely nothing work with. The scene where he disarms Deadshot was so rapidly edited that you don't see a thing that's going on. Then when Amanda Waller is done delivering exposition at a meeting, we go to another scene of Waller delivering exposition at a meeting. I have no idea why this was even two different scenes as she basically says the same things the second time but it only further delayed the film actually getting started. Then when it does start the action is completely boring and weightless. It just goes from one scene where they fight a bunch of black goo people to another and I couldn't be less invested in it.

Jared Leto is by far my least favourite on screen Joker. He comes off like a try hard gangster-type character and I groaned through every scene he's in. I have no idea what his characterisation was meant to be or what Leto was told to act like, but he might as well be flailing his arms around screaming ""look at me, I'm crazy"", he's that over the top and just downright strange. I also found it hilarious that anyone would respect or even take him seriously.

Cara Delevingne as Enchantress is Joel Schumacher-level campy. Its like she was told to watch Posion Ivy in Batman & Robin and just do that. Every time she was on screen I couldn't stop laughing at her waving her hips and arms around, as well as her comically hammy line delivery, which coupled with the weird sound effect on her voice makes Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy look subtle by comparison. I also have no idea how the whole Enchantress thing with her brother and her heart works or what the hell was even happening in the villain plot. The big monster thing that I guess was her brother was also laughably silly. 

The Squad having a complete change of heart so that the film can have a climax was completely out of nowhere and felt entirely unearned. The final fight is lit and edited horribly to the point where I couldn't tell who was meant to be hitting who amongst the darkness and fog. Then the villain is beaten because they throw a bomb at her and shoot it and that's really the best they could come up with. The slow motion in that scene was beyond excessive too. Also what could have been a good end for El Diablo's character is rendered hilarious when he turns into a big fire monster to fight the other big monster man.

The character relationships are paper-thin. I didn't care about Rick Flagg and Enchantress one bit which really hurt the climax, nor did I see any reason why Deadshot didn't just kill Harley. And yes I know they have a thing in the comics, but there's absolutely no setup for it here. The Squad members are almost all completely useless in the mission. Slipknot just shows up out of nowhere to be killed after maybe thirty seconds of screen time and Katana also shows up in a scene that felt like they forgot to add an introduction scene for her so they just had her show up and announce herself. Outside of a couple of them, most of them either get one short scene thats supposed to be their character development or aren't fleshed out in any way. 

Joker's story simply revolving around getting Harley back was completely underwhelming and was noticeably cut down massively which I would complain about if Leto wasn't unbearable to watch in the scenes he was in. The Joker has no memorable scenes and his entire motivation for even being here is that he wants Harley back, which feels very off if you know anything about these two characters.

As for what I liked, Margot Robbie as Harley stole the movie. She was a delightfully fun presence and although her one-liners didn't always land she was the most enjoyable part of the film by far. The only thing about her character I didn't buy was her relationship with the Joker, which was given very little time to be fleshed out and just didn't work. That being said the scene where she's sad about him supposedly dying and then has to pretend to be upbeat and fun again was really strong and Margot Robbie really sold that moment. Will Smith and Jai Courtney were both also enjoyable to watch and the Flash cameo was actually kinda fun.

Viola Davis was solid as Waller and I really wish she'd been the villain instead. There were two very strange scenes with her though, one where she just shoots her own people out of nowhere and the other where she shows up unharmed after the final fight, when in the previous scene she was hooked up to some... witch thing? Then she just walks out like nothing happened.

The music choices were very cliche and uninspired, feeling like a rundown of songs that are usually in movies and most of the songs were completely out of place in the scenes they were in. As everyone has said, it's also extremely obvious that a lot was cut out and the film doesn't flow at all thanks to all over the place pacing and choppy editing.

Oh and the mid-credits scene was a hilariously thinly veiled attempt to recreate the Nick Fury scene from Iron Man.

Very disappointing overall. If you want to see a good Suicide Squad film then I would definitely recommend Assault on Arkham, the animated one. It uses most of the same characters in a better way and has an appropriately smaller scale that fits the Suicide Squad much better. ",4w86a7
d67ljj4,"Pros: Introduced a bunch of characters so we won't have to suffer through any more shiity, and shoed in introduction scenes

Cons: Plot was really bad. Amanda's justification for the suicide squad didnt work for me i feel like it was super forced. Feel like they also tried to make us sympathize with the squad but its hard since most of them are hardcore killers. The plot armor was so thick, like navy seals were getting killed left and right but Harley and Boomerang were chilling. They over used the joker laugh and it was just annoying at the end. Also didn't hype me for the upcoming movies. Im pretty sure they are going to be just as bad sadly.",4w86a7
d68iz6l,"I was incredibly disappointed with the Joker. I don't mind that he shows up so little, because I hated Leto in the role. I was going in expecting and wanting him to be the best part of the film, and I just didn't care for his performance at all.


Overall I enjoyed the film though",4w86a7
d68jpul,"Did I miss something? How did the Joker know that they were putting the bombs into the squad's necks, let alone know where to find the one guy in the world who could deactivate said neck bombs?

Any anyone else find it dumb that Harley escapes then shortly after she comes back and no one bats an eye? Really poor writing, editing and pacing overall. The villain was also someone way out of their league and they should have been given a villain they can handle. ",4w86a7
d6574ds,"Okay, I can say firmly that this movie is pretty terrible, and this is coming from a fan of DC. I wanted the critics to be wrong and I even went in with low expectations, but this movie really dropped the ball in a big way. 

I would do a pros and cons list but I really and truly believe there aren't any stand out pros to Suicide Squad. Many people seem to be commenting on the good performances, but all I got from the film were performances that went super cheese ball or at the very least felt uninspired. Harley Quinn was fine, but quite literally everyone else was either comical (Diablo and Croc were laughable stereotypes) or lame. Will Smith just played himself and viola Davis did her bad-ass doing what needs to be done thing. Jared Leto was not very good in his role, and the joker didn't feel like his character at all. 
In fact I'd go so far to say that he was flat out bad, and I can't really decide if it was his performance or the film itself. 

The film was neither funny nor dramatic, and there was zero characterization apart from odd flashbacks and hasty intros. The plot was utter crap and entirely cliched, the villain was WAY too much in all the wrong ways and had no real motivations apart from being evil and destroying things. For a movie about a bunch of bad guys there was very little evidence of their criminal backgrounds, instead making them all good people with troubled histories. Don't expect fun crazy antics of super villains, expect tired tropes and lame jokes. The editing was all over the place, the pacing non-existent, and the writing...you may as well just listen to the sound of a plumber being shoved into a pile of dookie over and over because it's total shit. I'm not even trying to be snobby - I was expecting this to be some classic popcorn flick dumb fun but it couldn't even be that. Kill me for saying it but I think BvS was better than this failure. 

TL;DR - There is a scene where croc is watching the Black Entertainment Television channel in his cell after personally requesting it, and it somehow isn't funny but instead cringeworthy. Suicide Squad!  ",4w86a7
d64ut8s,"I hate Leto's Joker so much. He doesn't feel like the Joker. He feels more like a gangster that acts crazy to scare people off. They also didn't explain his stupid 'Damaged' tattoo on his forehead. 

That squint he does while smiling is irritating to me too for some reason.",4w86a7
d64wkkc,"I loved it.

The humor was good. Boomerang's unicorn fetish and dickishness (When Flagg told them they were free to go and he just fucking hightails it lol.) Croc wanting a couch and BET, Floyd teaching his daughter about hypotenuses.

I thought Will Smith was fantastic. I was really worried that he'd just phone it in but I loved it.

I loved Jared Leto's Joker. I don't know, I get the reason why some people wouldn't like it but I loved his performance.

Jay Hernandez was far and away my favorite actor and I thought El Diablo was awesome. I really felt for him.

Katana was badass. I really felt for her when she was talking to her husbands soul. I just wish they had given her more action. And I really liked Croc too but, as with Katana, I felt they didn't give him enough backstory or action but he looked really cool and had some good lines. I was really upset because I wanted the 8 foot tall Crocodile from the comics but I really liked how he looked.

Enchantress was creepy as fuck and I loved it. The scene where Flagg, Moone and Waller are in the Pentagon and Moone transforms was creepy as hell. And when Enchantress took full control she got so much creepier. I loved the headdress too

And Boomerang, my god, Boomerang. He's exactly what I imagined a live action Boomerang would've been. An alcoholic, jerk Aussie.

The things I didn't like:

The Slo-Mo towards the end was wayyyy too overdone.

They didn't give Croc, Boomerang or Katana enough backstory or action.

I didn't like how they had the Joker as basically a love sick puppy, I wish they would've shown the abusive side to their love.

Like everyone else has stated, the pacing just seemed really off.

I loved Cara Delevingne as June Moone/Enchantress but she didn't seem like a very well fleshed out villain. Her plan to take over the world seemed a little odd. I get she wanted to wipe out humanity because they turned on her and her brother but what exactly was she trying to do? Strike everyone with lightning?

All in all I give this movie a 7 out of 10. I liked it better than MoS and BvS TC. It tried a little too hard to be ""edgy"" but I still really liked it.

-The Joker (just thought the character itself was poor and he didn't come across menacing or cunning)
-Random characters seeming forced (Katana, Slipknot, etc)
-the Villian (SO BAD)
-All the love interests (Witch girl and the soldier- like come on how was I supposed to care, also didn't care for Joker and Quinn)
-Effects I didn't think were great

d64xil6,I'd give it a 6/10. Margot was absolutely amazing as Harley and stole the show. Viola was great as Waller. Will Smith was pretty good except he didn't really wear the mask. Boomerang served literally ZERO purpose to the entire movie. Diablo was badass. Croc was hilarious. I absolutely HATED Leto's Joker. That wasn't the Joker. He's not some pimp in a night club wearing gold chains and rings. My view of him and Harley has always been that Harley is madly in love with him and he uses her but isn't particularly in love with her and wouldn't go thru the lengths he did this movie to save her. ,4w86a7

Robbie lived up to the hype and I'd love to see a Harley/Joker movie -- I really liked The Joker as a gangster.  Even Will Smith surprised me a bit.  But it just wasn't well made.  It was choppy, the plot had no meat and above all else it was predictable.  I'm just so sick of the four quadrant please every walking, breathing human alive studio films.  I get it, they make absurd amounts of money and that's the studio's game.  But it just sucks to see a movie like this, which could have been so much better (R rating, tighter plot) not pan out.

But oh my fucking god why are they god mode but never want to use their powers against the only people that could stop then when they are at 99% of their fucking plan. New writers please. DC Studios also needs to happen since WB is actually fucking them over to Fox levels. ",4w86a7

d64z01x,"Ok, I haven't really heard this complaint, but the part that really upset me was in Harley's introduction, when it says something to the effect of ""suspect in Robin's murder."" Why do they keep teasing that (BvS did too), and why would they start the universe after that storyline? Seems odd to me.
Otherwise, I thought it was decent. Better than BvS, not as good as Civil War.",4w86a7
d64z2ce,"I wanted more Joker scenes. Not because I was loving Leto's performance, mind you, but because I was hoping to see something more than Leto impersonating Ledger's Joker voice. And he needed to laugh more. I felt like the only times I heard him laugh were when he's doing that slow, drawn out laughter. It was underwhelming.

Harley, however, worked. Although I wish Robbie could've done Sorkin's Quinn voice, I think it worked well for the movie. Her facial expressions were golden too. 

As for the movie itself, holy shit. The first half hour or so felt like a compilation video of assorted pop songs. I think it was DC's attempt at a Guardian of the Galaxy of their own? Whatever the reason, I disliked it. Using that White Stripes song felt out of place and unnecessary. Oh, and the whole time, I couldn't help but wonder what the Justice League members were up to at that moment when a global threat is doing bad things. I mean, if the Flash shows up to stop Capt. Boomerang, why couldn't he show up to try and stop whatever was going on in Midway?

And the CGI was awful. Enchantress dancing like some wacky waving inflatable arms tube man was hilariously awkward. Katana felt underused or unnecessary. I liked Smith as Deadshot and Kinneman as Flagg but I wonder how it would've worked had they switched roles. 

All in all, the movie was entertaining in some parts and mostly overall, but the pacing and plot almost killed it completely for me. I'd still watch a sequel if that got greenlit, but this movie was somewhat forgettable.",4w86a7
d64zihj,"I liked it till the last act. There was no time to build up all characaters. Deadshot and Harley shined , and others too had glimpses. It was much more entertaining than BvS.

However, the whole last act was severly underwhelming. The world destruction machine plot-device was done to death. And it was executed almost as poorly as Fan4stic. Enchantress was totally cringe-worthy with the whole voodoo dance thing. Even the climatic battle was meh. I feel like this could have been so much better if they didnt rush it.

 Joker had a very limited role, but thats more of an issue with misleading ad campaigns. They could have made it clear that he was more of an extended cameo.",4w86a7
d6507wq,"my bare bones opinion: it was a'ight. honestly my biggest complaint is the joker was never in a purple suit! i mean, wtf!?",4w86a7
d650x7f,"I really enjoyed this film. Didn't know a lot about it (beyond the trailers) going into it, and never read a single one of the comics. In my personal opinion the movie would be a solid 7.5 It's not good enough to make an 8 but 7 feels too low - as if I'm not giving it credit for what it did do well.

Something that occurred to me while I was watching it is that it felt very 'comic book-ee'. The flashbacks, the sequences, the pacing - it all felt like it was lifted right out of a comic book. Marvel movies are good movies, and often good adaptations of characters, but the pacing/flow has always been more about making a good movie about superheros rather than making a good comic book movie.

An example of two scenes.

Avengers - Hulk playfully punches Thor and he goes flying. This is the kind of scene that works very well in a movie and could be done in a comic - but it wouldn't be as well done. It's hard to capture the smirk, the mirth, the amusement that the music and scene that is captured in the film. This is a great moment in a movie starring superheroes.

Suicide Squad(SPOILERS) - In the bar scene Captain Boomerang grabs some beers and takes off after everyone is told they can go. Shortly after this scene the heroes (villains?) are walking down the street together towards their objective when Boomerang shows back up and falls into step with the rest. Here's the thing - in the narrative of the story this was an odd choice. He had no reason to come back and every reason to leave. But if you were reading a comic about a superhero team and you knew he was on it you wouldn't think twice about this sort of thing. Of course he's coming back - he's one of the squad. You get a panel with a head nod or something and you're all good. But trying to translate that pacing (or that expectation of understanding upon the reader/watcher) doesn't necessarily work.

I'm not saying that what DC is doing is superior in any way, shape, or form to what Marvel is doing - I'm just stating what I think is happening.",4w86a7
d65103q,"I'm not going to overdo it, but basically, I felt like no particular part of the movie was necessarily bad but they stitched the whole thing together with absolutely no plan, no vision. They overdid some stuff about Harley Quinn, Croc and Boomerang were pointless.

Also, I liked Leto as Joker. ",4w86a7
d651tff,"I enjoyed the movie. Story wise it was lacking, the bad guys (the main villain) was stupid too, but the squad itself really worked, really like the harley/joker dynamic, as well as all the characters.

d66foha,"Just saw the movie, I mostly enjoyed it. Honestly, I had fun. I loved the flashback character intros with the highlight coloring. The music took me a out a little bit - seemed a little GOTG-ish - but still fun. But the main issues I have are three-fold:
1) the SS fought way too overpowered an enemy. I think they should have gone up against something more like, say, a warlord. A warlord with an army on international territory. So the US government doesn't have NATO support and can't attack, and also it's too dangerous cause the army is too powerful, so they send in the expendable people, aka the SS, who actually have a chance at beating them. But if they lose the govt can claim no involvement, etc. This would allow *each* character's strengths to be played more, like Boomerang and Katana, whom we saw way too little of. Even Harley and Deadshot, who really had no business going up against someone like Enchantress. They would each get a chance to really shine against some everyday baddies. 
2) there was only one exposition.  I would have loved to see a few missions before the climaxing one; they fail one, they grow as a team, they find *other* reasons to fight that are directly attributed to the bombs in their necks (I don't know how exactly, maybe one of them died at the hands of the warlord. Work with me here). 
3) Beyond Harley's flashback intro (which was awesome), what was the point of Joker? They should have left him out of the rest of the movie for the Batman movie. He's too big to leave so small. ",4w86a7
d66fq6e,"Well, it was more fun than BvS, but probably just as incoherent in terms of tone. The first act of the movie is probably the most fun to watch, with all the character intros, but the writing was kind of poor and the plot just seems so out of place for what is essentially meant to be an ensemble movie about people who are villains. The editing and pacing is really awkward and the movie just felt like it was trying so hard to emulate Guardians of the Galaxy, with all the soundtrack choices (which were really overused to the point where it was distracting) and trying to make a team of ""losers"" out to be heroes. None of the ""arcs"" feel like they're earned. It seems like the story should have been grounded and structured more as a heist film that goes to shit, rather than yet another ""save the world from apocalyptic, lights-in-the-sky, world-ending threat"" that we've seen again and again and again in these movies. In the final act I was just thinking ""where the fuck is the Justice League? This dancing witch thing is way above of this group's pay grade."" I mean, I know the Justice League hasn't been formed yet, but it's been established that Batman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, and all these other people exist. I genuinely would have praised this movie had it completely subverted all expectations and had the villains actually end up walking away from the big threat for someone else to handle. When Boomerang took off at the end of the bar scene, I was like ""that's great. It would be awesome if that was literally the last we saw of the character (at least during that whole situation)."" As a simple ""heist"" film, they could have played with the characters so much more in fresh and interesting ways. The most interesting stuff would be how they manipulate each other or try to weasel out of their predicament. You know, just being actual villains looking out for their own self-interests. And maybe throw in a little more Batman, just for good measure, because Ben Affleck's Batman is just great. Easily my favorite part of the movie is his ""cameo,"" but I feel like it could have been more interesting if Batman had an actual presence throughout the story, almost on the sidelines.

So as for what I liked: Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Jai Courtney, and Will Smith were enjoyable. I kind of wish Jai Courtney had a little more to do, because I was excited to see him actually play a fun character, as I don't normally enjoy him in movies, and he's kind of thrown into the shuffle with an ""ensemble"" that's probably a little too large. And with Will Smith, I had a caveat throughout the whole movie (and something that makes me dislike him in movies) which is that he's just playing ""Will Smith."" I never felt like I was watching Deadshot, the character. I was just watching Will Smith do what he's always done in these kinds of action movies, just with slightly more bite. It's amusing and he's charismatic, but I'd prefer to watch a character rather than Will Smith reveling in his own egotistical need to be the star of the movie. Jared Leto was ok, but very underutilized. I came in optimistic that his Joker would impress, but I'm not really sold yet, and I'm not sure I will be. It's hard to know from this movie because he's hardly in it long enough, and he's not that central to the plot. But even still, it kind of felt like a waste of talent. ",4w86a7

It also focused way to much on certain characters and made the rest of the squad pretty much useless or just there to say a quick little joke here and there. with such a small scope and contained story they kinda fucked themselves on advertising as it basically gives away a lot of the plot other than the main villain who, just like most of the squad, gets almost no attention other than to remind the audience why they're even doing what they're doing.

I would like to note that there does appear to be issues with darkness during scenes, but may be a theater issue and not a movie issue.  Due to problems caused by weather, my theater had the projectors go out for about 10 minutes, but when they restarted them, they movie had kept playing.

I was also disappointed by BvS, however upon re watching the film in its 3 hour ultimate version I found that I did enjoy it MUCH more, although it's still far from what it should have been in my opinion - it was a VAST improvement with many of the 'pointless' plot arcs in the cinematic release were actually given context that made them relevant.

I think Suicide Squad probably has a much better cut that will come out over the next few years, and we will have a far better film on our hands and we will have a 'Blade runner' like situation.

My biggest issue with BvS, even though I have grown to enjoy the film more than I did on the initial viewing in the cinema, and the Ultimate edition is a far better cut. The fact that a film called Batman V Superman isn't amazing in 2016 is beyond me. If this was 1996 it wouldn't shock me, but this is a world where Disney/Marvel is able to make amazing movies based on guardians of the galaxy (heroes most people hadn't even heard about 4 or 5 years ago).
DC can't rely on using the big names to bring in the numbers, they need to make another 'The Dark Knight' and make another amazing film. Hell their animated features do it a few times a year. (Although the Killing Joke release this month was a bit of a dud)",4w86a7

d6ap7c1,"Not only has everything interesting already happened, but our glimpse into these things has been reduced to a jumbled series of short, poorly summarised flashbacks that seem to belong to a ""previously on Suicide Squad"" segment. This so we can quickly get on following these underdeveloped characters being strung along on a tediously ride in which their only available actions seem reduced to reacting, and even then it's only with banter, or brawling in uninspiredly mundane fight scenes that get us, first, nowhere and then to yet another CGI final boss (waiting harmlessly for our team to show up, as final bosses do). The one point where characters did take meaningful action and decide to go for a drink was the only decent scene in the film. After this point, the group behaves as bonded even though the only thing they have in common is that they are bad guys and that they all complained about being strung along on an adventure with no meaningful purpose, coherent explanation or relevant stakes. Well, I can at least relate to them concerning the latter. 

While there are some moments deserving credit or a smile, their number doesn't come close to the cringes or the sighs of boredom. Watching the film felt like listening to an ""edgy"" 12-year old's invented story,  having the same lack of affinity with story-telling, character development and cohesion. In an effort to spice up the tone, they've edited everything so tight and sprayed it with so much music (some of which from recent, better films it tries to emulate) as if they hope we won't notice how disjointed, dull and dire it all is, but we did. #notmyjoker",4w86a7

I thought the film was a tad rushed and could have greatly benefited in being a netflix series. This would allow it to flesh out it's characters a little bit more as some of them were pretty useless. (killer croc, katana & boomerang) The best part to me was the bar scene. This allowed the characters to interact and gave time to flesh out diablo too. The film suffered from a weak villain like lots of mediocre superhero films do. (i.e. apocalypse & doomsday) This also causes the stakes to not be as high and the action to me felt kind of boring. It really seemed like the script for a video game and all the action scenes were various levels. Successful superhero movies also show cool character moments that showcase their abilities like quicksilver in x-men dofp or antman in civil war. The closest this movie got to it was when diablo turned into the giant flame indian. Harley Quinn was good and Will Smith was funny. Jared Leto was fine, he wasn't given much to do or say due to the weak script. I enjoyed the music in the movie. The introduction of the characters in the starting was cool too.

There wasn't character development until like 1 - 1 1/2 hours in, and there's only two of them got actual development (Deadshot and Diablo).

They should be non biased, summary with pertinent info like the general consensus ratings and cast/crew.

d64xgip,"Why is this movie getting slammed so badly? I saw it and thought it was a pretty entertaining movie. Not a great film but a hell of a lot better than Batman vs Superman and funny as hell.

The villain was incredibly lame. They introduced The Enchantress and she literally went rogue not even 5 minutes later in the movie and then just attacked the world. She doesn't even do a single thing with the team. She's introduced as introduced as Flag's girlfriend and the government's great weapon and then I blinked and the Enchantress is already destroying the world. They hadn't even introduced the entire team yet before shit went down. I thought it was a foreshadowing of problems later, or even for a sequel, but nope this movie is about the Squad trying to stop the Enchantress from taking over the world. It just didn't have the feel of being the reason why the team came together. Probably because this is like the 50th movie that has a villain trying to open a hole in the sky to destroy the world. I did feel like there was also a bit of story missing at the end. They are villains and don't care about each other. They've all known each other for a few hours but all of a sudden they are calling themselves family.

The comedy was good. I loved that the team had to save Flag over and over again because Enchantress specifically wanted him because he knew how to kill her. Forming a wall around him and not even letting him fight was hilarious. Boomerang running away immediately after Flag deactivates the bombs in their necks. Then there was Slipknot immediately getting his head blown off after trying to escape. You could see it coming a mile away but it was still funny. Will Smith getting Diablo to man up and all the shit he kept giving Flag was great.

The performances, save for Enchantress, were great in my opinion. Will Smith pretty much killed it as Deadshot. Margot Robbie was so perfect as Harley Quinn that a couple of times I thought the actress from the animated series had dubbed a few of her lines. Leto was great as The Joker and he really lived up to the part. Diablo was one of the best parts of the movie. I thought Kinnaman did a great job in a pretty thankless role as the guy on the team who has to play it straight while everyone else acts crazy. Viola Davis was so good as the evil Nick Fury. I wanted to see her get killed so badly.

d65a31x,"If the MCU was a restaurant the worst thing I could say about some of their food would be that at times it was bland and/or overcooked.
If the DCEU was a restaurant I'd be sending my meal back wanting to know who had the bright fucking idea to have peanut butter and jelly sauce on a rare scotch fillet steak on a side order of rice that had been boiled in tequila. 
WB and the Snyders just need to leave the DCEU alone. Once more they had some good characters with some okay to good performances and it feels like they just ruined it in post production and editing. 

Harley and the Joker seemed to have an actual connection, even though I wasn't a huge fan of Leto's interpretation he had presence when he was on screen, they had chemistry. Deadshot was Will Smith but he did what he did and it was like watching an athlete do what's required of him so his teammates can win the game, Captain Boomerang was a massive fucking stereotype and really derivative but genuinely enjoyable. I felt like Diablo and Killer Croc would have had me emotionally invested if they had been in previous films and I had gotten to know them. Viola Davis was great as Amanda Waller.

But the whole DCEU is just a mess right now. The fight scenes are completely pointless because the plots are irrelevant or nonexistent and it just feels like WB are throwing heroes and villains at the screen all at the same time and hoping that they stick. They have the actors, they've got acceptable to good performances from enough of those people cast already to suggest that isn't the weakness. The whole time I was watching this I was thinking I could have actually cared about Diablo if he was a bad guy in another film that introduced one of the JL. Two birds, one stone. Flash could duke out with Captain Boomerang, they seem to be the comedic duo of the two groups. Aquaman vs Diablo for a Water v Fire type showdown. Batman, Joker, Harley, Deadshot could work well together. Although Batfleck doesn't necessarily need them and I almost feel like with the connection Robbie had with Leto and Smith a Harley, Joker, Deadshot film could have legs. 

But none of this happened. Exposition was lazy and forced. Katana and Slipknot were completely irrelevant. June Moone/Enchantress needed to be recast but you could use her as a character with Rick Flagg and Amanda Waller to actually endow this film with some sort of emotion. But it's just a mess.

I want the DCEU to work, I really do, they have so many great characters and stories to tell, but when I was watching this film it finally clicked why the MCU is better at the moment.
Both DCEU and MCU are being run by fanboys and fangirls, which is great, because the characters are getting the care they deserve, but at no point does the MCU allow itself to be distracted by their fan desires when constructing a story for those characters. The MCU scripts are weak at times, but they are coherent. The DCEU films so far have been incoherent beyond the pale and I can't see that changing anytime soon. They stuff too much into each film. They don't give their characters a chance to breathe and invite us along with them on their adventures. They just mushroom slap us with interesting visuals in seemingly random order.

But I don't think WB are going to realise this in time.

Let's be clear here the movie is a mess mainly because of the hack job edit and I'm still holding on to my pet theory that there is a secret editor's strike/blacklist in hollywood or at least because of internal politics at DC that's causing all this chaos.

All the same issues that BVS had but nowhere near as egregious and some of the shots and cinematography was great on the level of Alex Ross portraits.

The  action was mediocre and poorly cut felt like watching a Bryan Singer Xmen movie or a mid 2000's subpar comic book movie but I repeat myself.

The characterization was terrible for some which could be fixed with a proper edit and we'll see with all the scuttlebutt about different versions of the film, so I'd like to see a proper version of this cut.

Quite unfortunate to see such a squandered opportunity and that Batman v Superman messed up this film because of the hype this could build with certain cameos and revelations

I didn't understand this ""family"" dynamic in the end. They hardly connected through dialogue at all. Am I supposed to believe that because they are all evil they connect easily? 

Also the music choices were less than stellar. I liked it in the beginning, it had a little charm by bringing in some classics, but that quickly wore away after the 4th or 5th track. It just got annoying.

If you saw more than one trailer, you've seen most of the movie. There was not many surprises beyond that, and that was disappointing.

Regardless of all of that, it was still entertaining to watch, but that's about it.

d6520w0,"Honestly I think this movie deserves every bad review it's gotten. Aside from a few cool dead shot moments and funny jokes, it was just trash.

d64uqr7,"Super disappointing, tbh. Kind of a ""last nail"" sorta thing for DC. 

The acting was fine, specifically Harley Quinn and Will Smith playing Will Smith was good. 

Apart from that, it was rediculously messy, corny, and overall just barely watchable. 

The action was horrible. Flat out. They didn't do anything unique or creative with any setpiece, and the most interesting thing they did with these bland-ass action scenes was adding some slo-mo. I was hoping for some awesome mixes between animation and live-action... but nope. Just nothing. 

It was bland. The villain was a non-factor. The story was a jumbled mess. The character motivations were terribly thought out.

There was a scene with Deadshot and a decision and it actually so bad several people in the theater laughed out loud.

d64ug27,"The writing was absolutely awful. I’m not sure what was going on in that writer’s room, but this whole thing was riddled with problems. I won’t go over everything, just two of instances I want to point out. For starters, let’s talk Slipknot. It was pretty obvious that he was going to die at some point due to the fact he was barely involved in any of the marketing, but jesus I did not expect it to happen that fast. He had maybe 2 minutes of screen time and a total of I think 3-4 lines. When they killed him my immediate reaction was, “Ok, and…?” I understand that it was to establish that Flagg wasn’t bluffing with the neck bombs, but *come on*. I had no reason whatsoever to feel sorry for his death. There was no backstory on him, no motives, nothing to make me care. Even if they just had a quick shot of him looking at a family picture or something similar when they were flying into the city, at least that would have evoked a little emotion from the audience when they blew his head off.

After Wallace tells the Squad that the helicopter with Joker and Harley had been shot down and they both were killed, did anybody else find it weird how literally *nobody* in that entire group questioned how Harley survived after they came down and saw her?? They come down, see her, toss her her bat, and then move on to their next objective. No “How did you survive?”, no “Where’s Joker?”, it was just *off*. You would think after seeing someone who you assume is dead that you would have some basic questions for them, but I guess that just flew right over the writer’s heads.

Obviously there’s a lot more than just these two issues when it comes to the overall movie, but I’ve already written a lot at this point. I’m extremely disappointed with how this turned out and I’m gonna be extremely cautious when it comes to the future movies that come out of this franchise.",4w86a7
d64uj5x,"what's bothering me is that everybody is talking about how good the soundtrack is, and yeah the songs are good songs, but they werent used very well. out of no where a song i like would come on and then it would have nothing to do with the scene and then just cut off.  i think they were trying to do what Guardians did, but in that movie the songs were a part of the story and were used to show Starlord's character.  DC missed the reason why the music worked so well in Guardians and just tried to replicate that in this (hell they even used Spirit in the Sky)",4w86a7
d64v0uz,"*""And there came a day unlike any other, when earth's nastiest villains were forcibly united under threat of death against a common threat. On that day, The Suicide Squad was born - To fight the foes that no hero had time to bother with because they were too busy brooding somewhere else in the SnyderVerse.""*

I was one of those who wasn't wowed by the trailers for Suicide Squad for the same reasons that I wasn't initially excited for Guardians of the Galaxy. They both appeared to be potentially messy films with too many unknown characters to keep track of the plot. So I kept my expectations low for both films. While I ended up loving Guardians, I can't say the same for Suicide Squad.

#Let's start with the positives of this movie:

* Holy shit! There IS colors in the DCCU!  
* My ass wasn't begging for mercy when the credits hit.
* The action was solid.
* The Joker wasn't as bad as I thought.
* The universe tie-ins were good. 
* Jai Cortney was good. Apparently Captain Boomerang's secondary power is to magically teleport beer towards him. 
* Waller was spot-on.

#Now the iffy things:

* Margot Robbie's Quinn was ok. She was slipping in and out of the, ""Mistah Jay!"" accent quite often. It was hard to tell if that was because of the plot or the reshoots, but I found it hit or miss.

* I think the Pink Unicorn gag would've worked if we hadn't known that ahead of time in the introductions. It fell flat every time it came up after that. 

* Oh Hey! I wonder why they didn't introduce Slipknot until 30 mins in oh he dead!

* Katana comes out of nowhere, get's a half-hearted explanation, and despite being on Flag's side, she just immediately joins up with the baddies when they quit. It didn't make sense. It seemed like she was forced onto the movie.

* Joker seemed a little more like a rapey ganster than a comedic psychopath. I'm still not entirely sure how I feel about it.

#Now on to the bad:

* This movie is what I thought I was going to see when Guardians of the Galaxy came out. I can't help but feel like some of this was a response to it. The main thing that makes me think that is the abuse of the songs they were shoving down our throats during the trailers, and especially during the first half of the movie. I think 90% of it didn't fit with what was happening. 

* The songs in Guardians was part of Quill's character which elevated them to more than just rhythmic noise for the audience to like. In Suicide Squad, they started with classic rock songs during nearly every scene change, then they transitioned into rap songs once they ""Assemble the team."" Then when shit gets serious, they switch to a musical score. Then back to Bohemian Rhapsody in the final scene. Why?!? It was distracting! Pick a theme or two and stick to it!! 

* I also didn't like the Borderlands inspired intros.  I understand they're there to give a brief summary of each player, but when two of them don't get one and we get the quick scene of their abilities, they seem redundant. 
 
* It's obvious that Will Smith was a huge influence on the writing of the movie because Deadshot's subplot was well worn out by the twelfth time he mentions that he has a daughter and he really wants to see her again. *WE GET IT!! YOU HAVE A CHILD!!!
QUIT TELLING US EVERY FIVE SECONDS!* Not to mention he had the most lines, jokes that were meh, and was given most opportunities to be a badass. While he was fine in the role, it definitely felt like he was being forced onto the movie. 

* The plot felt like a messy combination of Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. I think this is partly the fault of bad editing and aforementioned writing. It really killed the pacing when they fight the first wave of the army of creature thingies. It also adds to earlier Will Smith point. You could've cut that scene out, and it wouldn't have made a difference to the plot.

Overall, I'd say that it is better than BvS, but not by much. I have to agree with the Mann of Stuck when he gave it a C+. With the recent news of the leadership changes at DC, and the stuff I saw from Comic-Con, I still have faith they're going to make the DCCU into something compelling, but I won't see that until next year. 
",4w86a7
d64vn76,"The movie was all over the place! The trendy tunes featuring most of the soundtrack to Wayne's World being played anytime they cut to a new scene was annoying as shit. Harley was ok, Deadshot was too much of a pussy, and Leto's Joker was fucking awful. I'm pretty sure the Joker was purring with every line he spoke, fucking awful!",4w86a7
d64vwbq,"The villains were awful at best. Harley Quinn and Deadshot carry the main group, along with Waller. For all the hype Leto got as the Joker he was kind of meh for me. I could've done without a few of the minor characters they threw at us.

If its done properly I wouldn't be upset with a Harley Quinn spinoff. ",4w86a7
d64w4m6,"I got most of what I wanted. Some cool action scenes, Margot Robbie giving a solid performance in my opinion, and they're were some really solid moments in my opinion. But man this movie was paced so terribly, had so many cheesy lines, and was just not written well. I expected this to be so much better, but whatever. I enjoyed it. 

Edit: I really wanted more Joker. Im still not sure if I disliked Letos performance or not, but I wish he had more screen time. 

Edit 2: With more thought, I really think Leto did as much as he could with what he was given. He had no memorable lines, nothing really crazy to do, and just was not used enough. Like I get that Harley is the product of the Joker, but his character was so unimportant to the ""plot"" that they didn't even need him. Just such poor writing. ",4w86a7
d64wevl,"Overall I liked it. 

I'm interested the most in the Joker/Harley dynamic I think. The movie plays it like straight up cares about her. But then after Joker crashes the car in the chase scene, he leaves Harley there to drown.

Its just enough odd ambiguity. Does her life matter to him? He chases her throughout the movie, but who the fuck knows with the Joker? Its just enough room that I think they could do a 180 in future movies and it be dead on. 

Also....loved Harley's origin in this movie. I had heard the chemical vat thing before, but her voluntarily falling into it is great. 

I liked that, despite it being Enchantress that the Squad fights in the end, the real villain in the movie was Waller. I think a lot of the ""lame villain"" complaints sort of miss that point. Waller, aside from being a terrible person in general, is responsible for all of it. And everybody is working against her when they get the chance.

Perfect movie? No. But I think it nails the characters. ",4w86a7

d64zh0k,"Let me just get it out of the way by saying that it was a good movie. My biggest issue with the movie was the pacing of it. It was... weird. In the beggining of the movie everything was moving very fast but each scene in that section felt very slow. It was offputting to say the least. Another big issue was the music. While the song choices were very good, there was too many songs thrown into the movie in rapid succession to have any weight or importance to them. Other than that I felt like it was a solid movie other than a couple of little things. I thought Jared Leto was a good Joker, not great but good. He has a lot of potential to be great, just the Joker's lines in this movie were not that great and he wasnt in it a lot. It was not enough Joker to form an opinion on. The 3 most memorable people in this movie were El Diablo, Enchantress, and Deadshot. Each of those Characters were nearly perfect. As for Harely Quinn, Margot Robbie was good, but something just felt off. It was almost perfect, just something about her didnt sit right. Most likely her accent. It kept disappearing and reappearing and I couldn't quite get it to work for me. Those were the only things that really felt was keeping the movie from being great. Did anyone else not like the same things as me?",4w86a7
d6508zv,"Was anyone else turned off by the fact that Joker gave Harley an electro shock lobotomy of sorts to help unleash her 'crazy?'

d650a6k,"Will Smith was awesome.

Harley was decent. Could have been better if Joker had more time.

Worst Joker ever as far as I am concerned. He had very little screen time to be fair but he was reduced to Harley's romantic interest / literal get-out-of-the-jail-free card.

Enchantress was just terrible when not completely transformed. That dancing bullshit was just pathetic. Her ""brother"" was terrible.

Worst part was Captain Flagg's dumb romance.

Rest of the characters really were fillers at best.

d65rknd,"So, I don't consider myself a comic book nerd. Just to get my preconceived bias out of the way, the few comic books I ever had were given to me when I was a kid from pizza hut for ordering a personal pan pizza. I am a genuine fan of all, or most, of the Marvel movies. I've never seen any of the Superman movies because they all have looked terrible, but I was raised with Batman in the 90's, and I've seen all the Dark Knight movies of course. Never was a huge fan of them though. I won a free ticket to see this movie from one of T-Mobiles giveaways, so I decided, why not?

 A few things stood out to me: 1. The editing seemed really clunky. There's a part when they have a shootout towards the beginning and they randomly cut to bullets falling for 3 seconds, and it gets really quiet like somethings about to happen. Then it just cuts back to the action. It seemed very out of place. 2. It tries way too hard to be edgy, specifically with Harley Quinn. I think that when I was a fifteen year old listening to Linkin Park and wearing JNCO jeans I would have appreciated this, but now it just seems cringe inducing. 3. It's really poorly written, and it doesn't seem like many of the actors genuinely care besides maybe Will Smith. 4. There are many times where it tries really hard to be funny, and it just falls flat or feels awkward. 

I think if you're a fan of DC you would obviously enjoy seeing your favorite characters come to life, and you should probably see it. It's not horrible, but there was a part when Deadshot says, ""when is it over?"" and that sentiment seemed to be shared throughout the theatre. 5/10",4w86a7

d65ujmo,"My Review: All in all it was a good film, not great, which makes it disappointed after the amount of build-up it got. 2 people killed it in the film, and they were; Will Smith and Margot Robbie. They both had great chemistry together. Harley had some funny parts in the film, although half of her jokes were actually in the trailers itself. Will Smith was brilliant throughout the whole film. We didn't get to see much of Katana, but the parts she was in, she did well and had a good personal story. Captain Boomerang and El Diablo (Who i was very surprised to see die) were also good. As for Mr J, he was hardly in the film (Which is a good thing), he was some sort of a cameo, he did well, but personal opinion he was nowhere near as good as Ledger and Nicholson. Enchantress was a good ""villain"".

Here are the things i did not like about the film:
- Waaaaaaay too many flashbacks for my liking. I was expecting a good amount of flashbacks (For example: Harley getting transformed, Batman). But there was too many, i liked the flashbacks on how the ""Squad"" was caught, but throughout the film there was flashback after flashback after flashback.
The use of soundtrack. 
- Some of the songs used in the film just didn't connect with the specific scene. There would be slow music in an action scene and a fast paced music with a scene that had just talking. Some of the songs made no sense to me. But all in all the song choices were good.
- The Villain Goliath. From the trailers it looked like Goliath would be a good villain and a BIG threat, the way Amanda Waller described it. But it looked awful and it was just terrible, the way it was formed was bad, and it just wasn't needed. Isn't the original Goliath supposed to be red? Why the fu*k was this one orange?!
- The Final Battle. Was VERY disappointed with the film battle. It was short, simple as that. I just couldn't connect with it at all, you could say there was too much going on in such small timing. I was very glad when it was over, as in my opinion it was the worst part of the film. VERY disappointed with the scene.
- The end scene was great. Already a great build up for the sequel. It wasn't a ""Out Of Nowhere"" scene as i think most of the people knew Mr J was underneath the helmet. As for the sequel, i expect to see more of Mr J. This time he will be the real villain in the film, and the squad will team up once again to get Harley back? I'm not sure, seems likely? 

Final film rating - 7.8/10.

Best parts of the film:
- The introduction for the characters
- Deadshot
- Harley Quinn
- The Bar scene where they all connected together
- The End scene",4w86a7
d65v2xd,"I liked it. For me, it was good. It wasn't top tier, but it was better than OK.

The story did seem aimless, at times. I interpreted that to show that the Suicide Squad was being jerked around the whole time. The overall plot and story was fine. It didn't blow me away, but, in a weird way, I kind of liked that. It felt like the whole movie was more about setting a tone. It just felt like a cluster fuck. Normally I wouldn't like that sort of thing. With Suicide Squad, I was cool with it. The fact that there were no good guys in the movie (except the Batman and Flash cameos) made it Ok that it was just this struggle of a film. I mean, shit didn't work out for anybody, except Flagg and Dr. Moone.

Mainly, there were two things I was hoping for: a) a trippy/dark/go fuck yourself kind of tone, and 2) teeth gritting, blood lusting moments. 

I think the tone was met with Ayer, the soundtrack, Harley, the Joker, and Enchantress. Enchantress, by the way, I thought was dope. I loved the silhouette and the glowing eyes at the end. I also liked her voice and the trippy witch dance thing. I know people didn't dig the dancing. That's cool. I thought it was fitting.

There were some solid bloodlust moments. Obviously, Deadshot on top of the car was the big one. The other one I liked was when they all fought when being let out. That's just my thing. Those sorts of things go a long way for me in movies. I get that fire in my stomach, I grit my teeth a little, and just have this ""fuck yeah"" moment.

I also liked that the Joker was a part of Harley's background and kind of a side show. The Joker was cool too. It was different than any other joker. He was more of a gangster, and more emotional. I was cool with that too. I get that people wanted him to be a genius and the opposite side to the same coin as Batman, (which I still think he definitely can be) but, I liked this version.

Also, it didn't take anything away from the movie by the fact that I didn't laugh once. Although, that ""white people"" joke got a grin out of me.

There was other stuff I liked. There was some stuff I didn't so much like. There was also stuff that was fine, but I would have done it differently. I also felt a lot of the same about BvS. I also totally get a lot of the criticisms that people have for these movies. These are just my personal, emotional-based opinions.

d68j09i,"sorry for the long post, I'm copy pasting from a conversation I just had with a friend of mine. Here's my thoughts on the movie:

The opening was fairly strong. Performances in general were fine, believe when people say smith as deadshot is pretty fun. however, he's kind of like ben affleck's batman. the actor and the role are a good match, but the movie does not make very good use of him. harley's fine. joker is never funny, occasionally cringeworthy, and otherwise neutral (there's almost nothing to go by in the movie, he really isn't around very long).
editing is very messy, and this is a huge pet peeve of mine. far too many movies these days have this problem. 

the action is not good (at least by my standards, as a fan of good action movies). there is almost nothing there that we haven't seen before elsewhere. slow mo dodges, twirling around bad guys, shooting from awkward flexible positions. the action in general is a very big bore for me. diablo's full power was interesting though, and his character deserved more intimacy and development than he received.

the harley joker relationship served to establish harley, but otherwise amounted to very little within the actual story. after the bar scene, everything breaks down and the movie truly becomes a mess. boomerang leaves and reappears. motivations make no sense all of a sudden and turn on a dime. the ending is pure cliche predictable happy ending nonsense. anytime the movie has an interesting idea, or a cool concept, it balances itself out with cringey dialogue, bad action, and out of character character development.

it is visually a fairly strong movie. though it needed better lighting.
i don't hate it, i might even watch it again sometime at a party or something. its flaw's are striking, and its strengths are passing if not kind of forgettable. all in all, for me it's a 5/10. absolutely better than BvS, and very very close to the average review score on RT. speaking of, by the way, people really need to put in the effort and learn how to understand RT and the tomatometer. 26% doesn't mean the movie has a score of 2.6/10, it means that about 74% of critics rated it below 5.5 (the threshold for a certified fresh movie). it absolutely doesn't deserve a 2.6/10, but it's not above average either.

edit to add: the katana character was utterly pointless and should have been cut out of the movie. and i feel like it really needed a separate movie with time devoted to joker and harley before adding them into this film.  their development was rushed and included at the cost of some narrative strength and coherency.",4w86a7
d68mwbc,"Was let down overall after thinking that this would be really fun (perhaps due to cuts/edits as both my wife and I agreed the film had odd-pacing and seemed to jump around unnecessarily.)  We both thought Deadshot and Harley were enjoyable, but my wife questioned why overall we should really care with so little back-story and too many characters (plus most of them being one-note bad...), I guess we want Deadshot to get to see his daughter more because...umm, Will Smith, and also the Suicide Squad is a family according to El Diablo...umm, yuck.  Lastly Jared Leto's joker nearly ruined this film for me; again maybe the cut material would have given him better stuff, some of it was definitely the hokey writing and (alleged) cuts; just didn't really see/feel where he was coming from with his interpretation of the Joker.  Overall the film felt homogenized, like a bunch of people looked at what was popular (Arkham Games!) and tried to quick make a film that should have been better.",4w86a7

The movie did hit a few good points for me, but the bad really dragged this movie down, and I'd say out of the new era DC movies, this one is by far the worst.

**THE GOOD**

DEADSHOT - Will Smith nailed Floyd Lawton's characterization. I was really happy that they were able to adapt Deadshot to a different medium like film, and have a unique, and ultimately compelling version of the character.  I wasn't bothered by the fact that Deadshot is no longer a suicidal killer plagued by ennui and depression, because they used other already established elements of his character (like his daughter) to drive him.  I was also happy that it didn't just feel like I was watching ""Will Smith in a Deadshot costume"" - he really embodied the character.  Could've used more time seeing him in his mask, but that's just a fanboy nitpick.  Overall I'm excited to see this character reappear in the DC film universe.

HARLEY QUINN - Margo Robbie knocked this one out of the park. Unlike Smith, who kind of made Deadshot his own, Robbie played this character as close to perfect in line with the Comics and Animated universe as you can. Her crazy antics, her style, her demeanor, and her relationship with the Joker (at least her half of it) were all done very well.

AMANDA WALLER - Viola Davis really drove home who the real intimidating presence on the screen was supposed to be.  The executing of the FBI agents seemed somewhat heavy handed, but I think was overall effective in showing those unfamiliar with her character how Machiavellian Waller is supposed to be - she's a character whose sole goal is the security of the United States, and for her to reach that goal the ends *always* justify the means, killing those uncleared agents to preserve state secrets plays into that.

CAPTAIN BOOMERANG - Jai Courtney played the role of the drunk Aussie brawler perfectly. Best comic relief in the movie. Only gripe is that I would've liked to see more of him.  While I don't think they way they set him up will enable him to be the main villain in a Flash movie, I think he could have a prominent role in one.

GRIGGS - Another solid supporting character who brought good comedic relief.

**THE MEH**

THE JOKER - I wasn't really a fan of Jared Leto's take on the Joker, but that may be a consequence of him having about 5 minutes of screentime.  But just going on what we could see from Leto's take on the role so far, I got to say, I don't think it was that great.  He gets the crazy down, but he doesn't have the corresponding humor that the Joker has in almost all of his iterations.  He's the *Joker*, he's supposed to be funny in his own twisted, dark way - Leto laughed a lot but they weren't really prompted by anything that was actually funny or ironic going on.  The look was OK, but without the proper characterization he just comes off like some regular gang lord who dresses like a clown.  The Joker isn't supposed to run some sort of criminal enterprise - in fact, most of the other criminals of Gotham are supposed to be *more* afraid of him than of Batman.  He's irrational, psychotic, and does things for seemingly no reason. I didn't get that feeling from him at all.

Additionally for a movie that was marketed heavily on his appearance I found it odd and somewhat distracting towards the end of the film when I realized several of the scenes that made up the film's trailer had been left out.  

RICK FLAGG - I just found Flagg's character kind of boring and the love story with Dr. Moon unbelievable/not flesched out enough.

EL DIABLO -  Really liked his character up until the very end when he randomly told the audience he was actually a demigod and also decided that the people he had known for about 12 hours were now his second family.

BATMAN - Still love me some Batfleck, but his scene with the Joker and Harley was poorly edited and it seemed an odd story choice for him to request metahuman files from Waller as Bruce Wayne and potentially let her on to the fact that he is Batman.

**THE BAD**

EXPOSITION & DIALOGUE - Oh god the Exposition.  From literally introducing two characters by Flagg telling the audience who they are and what they can do, to Waller telling the audience that she ""made"" Flagg and Moon fall in love, the writers were incredibly sloppy in how we get to know these characters.  Deadshot and Boomerang were the only ones I didn't have any complaints about, Harleys was pretty good too but I didn't like the editing/pacing in which it was done.

Additionally, the Dialogue at times was idiotic. The most prominent of which was Diablo's assertion that the team he had known for less than a day was his 'second family'.  Other honorable mentions include Katana's weird crying scene, Killer Croc's weird racial stereotyping, and pretty much everything Enchantress says and/or is motivated by.

STORYTELLING - Holy crap were there some shitty storytelling choices here.  First off, don't set up Task Force X as an ""answer to Metahumans"" when, like, two thirds of the team are just normal people who are good at using guns/swords/boomerangs/a bat.  Also, if the team had Enchantress on it to begin with, why do they need anymore people? She's basically a god.  Also, why did they send her in first alone, shouldn't the initial response to the disturbance in Midway City be enough to activate task force X?

Second, DC needs to learn that *not every bad guy needs to be threatening world destruction*, especially in a Suicide Squad movie. Suicide Squad is supposed to be a group of deniable assets the Gov't can use to do shady shit. Maybe execute a foreign leader, maybe steal top secret documents, maybe spy on some sort of supervillain group.  What they're not is the freakin Justice League, so they shouldn't be fighting a big bad like enchantress.  In fact, the only thing I could think of when you get shown an *entire city* deserted was, where's Batman? where's Flash? Where's Wonder Woman?  Just a poor story telling choice.

Third, after they fucked up and chose Enchantress as the villain, they fucked up using her.  What was that vague magic thing she was working on? What was it doing? If she could do all that shit why did she engage in a knife fight with our (anti) heroes?

Also just other random plotholes, poor story telling - How did Waller survive seemingly fine after having like, a tentacle shoved in her head? How does a block of dynamite disrupt a magic spell?  Why did Waller keep all that sensitive Enchantress shit in her apartment, rather than in like, some secure facility (it's not like the government doesn't know to do that a la BvS)?  Did Scott Eastwood kill himself when he blew up Brother? Were we supposed to care about him?

EDITING - This movie felt like it was over in 30 minutes.  It felt like the cliff's notes of some other Suicide Squad movie. The cuts at time made little sense and often had impacts on storytelling, like, when enchantress bolts in the tunnel, how the fuck was Flagg able to disarm the bomb with a 2 second timer on it that she activated and threw to him? We don't know because the movie just cuts away and cuts back to him and the SEALS telling Waller enchantress got away.

POOR BACKGROUND CHARACTERS - Why was Katana there? She literally served no purpose. I get that Slipknot was just there to show that the bombs actually worked, but that was so obvious it felt stupid.  Killer Croc's look was all off *very clearly* because they didn't want to spend the $$ CGI'ing/Makeuping the rest of his body. He looked like a fucking regular dude with a bobble head on him.  Not to mention his character was a weird racial stereotype for some reason.


Overall I'd give the movie a 5/10, maaaybe a 6/10 if you are a fan of this new DC franchise.  DC really needs to step up its game if they have any hope of competing with Marvel.",4w86a7
d6625rl,"I'm actually stunned at how bad this movie was. If I hadn't seen gods of egypt, this would have been the worst movie I've seen all year, I liked BvS more than this, hell, I liked green lantern more than this. 

Also, I just wanna point this out, DCEU fans have no right to criticise marvel for their villians. Enchantress is the worst villain since Sharon Stone from Catwoman. The joker was awful, sounded like he was doing a richard nixion impression. 

And we also had Eisenberg as Lex and the awful looking Doomsday earlier this year from BvS.",4w86a7

d6726z2,"**I had super low expectation going into this movie, and was still shocked about how bad it was.** The humour was cringe-worthy, I kinda laughed once (the under-water scene with Harley), the story was terrible, the character development was horrible and bland, the Joker was fucking awful, plot holes everywhere, random scenes and flashbacks, forced character tension with the laziest writing imaginable, and cliches everywhere. All the characters were completly forgettable (even Harley Quinn, but mostly because of the god-awful lines she had). Most of the acting was extremly stiff, and I didn't buy into them being ""the scum of the earth"" at any point. The only character that seemed somewhat convincing was the black military lady (can't even remember her name), everyone else was pretty bad and boring.

 Batman was by far the best character of the film and he was in it for maybe 5 min total.


**Pros:** Harley Quinn's ass, Batman

**Cons:** Everything else, especally the joker.


But I did have some fun through the movie, because of my friends that I sat next to was really hyped for it and just by watching their facial expressions and constant facepalms/distress it made it into a somewhat worthwhile experience.

4/10 final score. And if Affleck makes a Batman movie, please pick another villain over the Joker. You really have to turn your brain off to enjoy this kind of movie.",4w86a7
d67jnb0,"Just wanted to share my thoughts. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would after reading some of the reviews. Some of my thoughts:

-*Deadshot*: Will Smith is a good actor that does well at playing characters who are just short of their boiling point with rage and/or sorrow. I really liked all his scenes. 

-*Harley*: OK, I get the criticism about her place in an anti metahuman team, but I saw her as the team wildcard. She sells herself as a ditz, which tends to disarm those around her. Remember, she's a trained psychologist, who despite falling for Mr. J, still knows how to read and manipulate people, which she did throughout the movie. (Edit) As far as her choosing the suicide squad over her promise of reviving Joker, I think she saw through the lie. She's psychotic, but not stupid. 

-*Joker*: I loved him. I really hope we see more of him in the future. I found him very reminiscent of the version of him from B:TAS. Also, did anyone notice the nod to Jared Leto's character from American Psycho during Harley's Enchantress-induced hallucination?

-*Captain Boomerang*: he was the comic relief. Sure, he was underpowered, but remember, these guys are disposable. Waller didn't give a fuck if he survived the mission. If he could bring something, anything, to the table, why not? As a professional thief, he'd be useful at casing and entering places that are meant to keep people out. 

-*Diablo*: probably my personal favorite character. He was the only one who was seeking some sort of redemption. I really liked his pathos. I just wish he could have had a little more of a central role, but that may just be me wanting more Latino presence in American cinema. I loved that he turned into an Aztec demigod in the end. (Edit) To add: I liked that out of all the characters, he was able to see through the hallucination. When Enchantress asks him how long he was able to see the truth, he says he was always able to. He saw the evil in his past and he made no excuses for himself. He owned up to his sins and knew that he could never go back. He knew that whatever promises Enchantress made were empty and all he could do was move forward. That's why he felt such an allegiance to the suicide squad. 

-*The editing*: yeah, it was flawed. The story did seem rushed, and some of the scenes seemed to have little to no transition in between. That said, I was still able to enjoy the movie. I'm hoping WB learns to stop meddling and to trust their directors' visions. This is really my main gripe with the movie. 

-*The plot*: I kinda see the ""villain"" as a sort of mcguffin. Enchantress wasn't the true antagonist. Waller was. The villain won in the end. I hope they explore this later in the DCEU. 

Overall, this wasn't a perfect movie, but I don't think it was as bad as so many people are making it out to be. If this had come out ten or fifteen years ago, I think people would be going nuts over it. I feel like a lot of folks these days go into movies with a fine toothed comb looking for reasons to dislike them. I'm glad I saw it in theaters, and I'm looking forward to more DCEU films. If you didn't like it, that's fine, I'm just saying how I feel. For the record, I'm not a DC apologist. I just appreciate the effort being made to bring these characters to film. 

",4w86a7
d68dzsw,"7/10 for me. I seem to be in the minority but I did like Leto's Joker and would have liked to see a lot more of him. Also having just watched BTAS all the way through, I thought Robbie did an excellent job with Harley.

Complaints are the same however; awful enemy, weak ending.",4w86a7
d68t556,"Holy Cow was there a lot of stuff in this movie that made no sense. 

Why didn't Deadshot kill Harley when Waller asked him to? The two had barely had a conversation at that point? Why would Deadshot not take his freedom and his daughters tuition in exchange for this woman he barely knows life?

Why did Boomerang come back after Flagg destroyed the detonation device?

Why was Katana there? Yeah, she was there to keep the criminals in line, but I've never seen a character do less in a movie. 

So Diablo isn't just a dude with firepowers, he's an actual demon or something? What the hell was up with that?

The suicide squad were supposed to be a black ops team or something, right? Why were they used to take down an incredibly obvious threat in the middle of a city?

d65m9sv,"Harley and Joker were the worst parts of the movie. Harley specifically cause it was such a fetishized terrible version of the character. Like you could tell that this version of the character is tainted by the fandom of the character. Some executives sat around and said ""what do people like about Harley Quinn? They think she's sexy, get that chick who did full frontal in Wolf of Wallstreet. They like that she's crazy so have her only ever say psycho shit and make her character just random.

d651v0g,Just finished watching it and I'm just feeling like I missed something. This movie is 2 hours long and yet it feels like so much is missing. The character development was so poor. They could've easily gave every SS member a proper intro but nope. The soundtrack sounded like they picked every cliché pop and rock song that would get the audience hyped but it was so overly used it took away from some emotional scenes that would be better with no soundtrack. It was an ok movie but ok movies don't fly when it comes to summer blockbusters especially super hero flicks. ,4w86a7
d6556t6,"Saw the movie twice, back to back, tonight. I followed production of this movie from day one and kept track of filming and leaks and everything. The trailers hyped me up, I was super excited and I was digging what Leto was doing with Joker.  After seeing the movie, it's clear this movie was butchered in the editing room and reshoots forced previous scenes to be deleted or be rearranged.  The end product was a poorly paced, badly edited, and forced narrative that doesn't give you anything to care about.  I think Ayer / WB made a poor choice in changing the narrative flow of the movie with editing and reshoots.  I really would have liked more Joker (yes, it's a Squad movie, but it's clear Joker had a larger role in the plot and was completely cut from the 3rd act). 

Things I loved: 
Harley - They did her justice (except for her hallucination...Harley would never want to be ""normal"" in a traditional sense...was totally out of character for her).
Deadshot - Will Smith is Will Smith but hot damn, he was cool to watch shoot guns and be the typical ""hero"" leader. 
Diablo - Really surprised that his character was well portrayed and his cool powers in the end. 

Things I didn't like: 
Boomerang, Croc, Katana, and Slipknot end up just being there.  Slipknot was expected to be short and die, but dude didn't even get an intro like the rest of the Squad. Why was he even brought into the Squad to begin with? His involvement wasn't explained. Killer Croc just felt he was tac'd onto the movie to fill out the team (and I wish they gave him more respect as a character). Katana, again...just tac'd on there (I assume to fullfill a asian demographic check list). Perhaps there's more material on these characters that could have helped flesh them out, but that wasn't in the movie. 

Major Problems:
Villain: Enchantress was just typical and we've all seen this type of villain a hundred times. It was boring and seriously, her popin' and lockin' magic machine making skills were laughable. 
Scott Eastwood: Why was he even in this? 
Editing: I kept noticing time and time again moments where stuff was clearly missing or unexplained or poorly cut.  
Pacing: By the 3rd act, I was bored and just waiting for the movie to end. 

Overall: It had some really cool moments, images, and characters. The bad thing is, the story sucked and the narrative was terrible that everything was dragged down by it.  I give it a C. It's average. Nothing special and what's sad is, there's maybe a really great movie hidden somewhere in all that footage filmed if edited correctly. ",4w86a7
d658bvw,"I thought it was good. Probably a 6 or 7 out of 10 from me.

The ways the characters interacted with each other were my favorite parts.

Didn't really understand the Rick Flag and June Moon relationship.

Katana should have been developed more. For one, she literally just appeared out of nowhere while Rick said ""Oh, and here's Katana.""

I liked how Diablo redeemed himself at the end, but his second family comment was really bad.

Seeing Batman and The Flash cameo were really awesome. Glad we got to see more Batman than what we got in the trailers. Wish I didn't see the posts about the The Flash possibly having a cameo.

They also cut out scenes I really wanted to see from the trailers, oh well. ",4w86a7
d65e3og,"I don't think the movie was as bad as people are making it out to be. Having said that, my biggest criticism is the music. Sometimes it was obnoxious and just needed to shut up.

Story and plot are nonsensical and the end just makes no sense at all but I enjoyed Will Smith and Robbie enough. 

WTF was up with the Enchantresses gyration crap at the end? And her Brother (what was his name?) CGI was terrible. Reminded me of the sentinel thingey from Thor.",4w86a7
d669fdo,"I thought the movie was alright. On one hand I enjoyed it, but on the other I can 100% understand the criticisms that I have heard. 


The plot is super bad. I hate this idea that the superheroes in movies have to defeat an ultimate bad guy/girl and save humanity. I think these unrealistic scenarios are really hard to make believable and this is part of the reason why Marvel has been outdoing DC recently: because their plots are a little more human and believable in general. 



One thing I want to harp on is the main villain. I think the main antagonist in this movie was just really weak and was almost just there to fill the screen as an objective for the good guys. Even in Marvel's bad supervillain movies (Age of Ultron) the villain has some backstory and some interesting qualities. I felt none of that for this villain and it really showed that the movie was just forcing Will Smith, Margot Robbie and others down your throat. 


One other thing that really bothers me about this movie is that they have so many loose/nonsensical ends to small-medium sized details. I don't want to get into spoiler territory, but it's impossible not to notice a handful of questionable details in the progression of the central plot.


I might not have noticed this without someone pointing it out to me, but the music was terrible. It felt like every transition had some hit song in the background just to force down your throat that it was a transition.


The big positive imo was all the actors had really good performances. The performances were just let down by the plot. Harley Quinn, Deadshot and the Joker (albeit not an integral part) were all great imo. Some might criticize Leto's joker, but it was a really good direction from Ledger's joker and I enjoyed him when he was on the screen. I didn't like Rick Flag, but he didn't stand out negatively. 


I really wish DC had gone back and made this movie with a different villain and goes on to make a movie with Leto as the joker. I see good performances and positives in BvS and Suicide Squad, but the writers and the directors just haven't put it all together and it's a damn shame. If you wanted to see this movie, I'd still recommend seeing it, but at best I'd say it was average.",4w86a7

To me the only 5 characters that mattered were Deadshot, Harley, Flag, Moon, and Waller. Rest seemed to be there just cuz. 

Now....the Joker. To be fair I don't want to blame Jared Leto. The movie waant about Joker, from the beginning, and this only added to the out of place scenes. They felt very forced. It would have been better to just give him flashback cameos but full scenes in the present movie plot didn't make any sense. Perhaps he might be better in a sole Batman vs Joker movie.",4w86a7

d67i1qi,"Overall I had a good time with this movie, but what struck me is that it had moments that were truly great and hinted at what this movie could have been. Unfortunately, they were usually fleeting. 

My biggest issue is that there seemed to be several useless characters. Killer Crock, Boomerang, Katana, etc really had no reason to be there and just ate up screen time. They either needed to be explored more or scrapped. 

I loved Deadshot, probably one of my favorite aspects of the movie. They gave his character a little depth which really helped add to things, unfortunately there were times the movie started to feel like a Deadshot movie instead of Suicide Squad. 

Harley Quinn had moments that were really wonderful, but they didn't give her enough time to fully flesh out her character. It wasn't until the end with the ""desire"" flash-forward and when she thought the Joker was dead that you could really see her potential as a character.

There are good things in it (Viola Davis is a near-perfect Amanda Waller, Will Smith gave a great performance, I even liked Batman’s brief appearances), but the overall film was a bit of a mess and the villains were generic and uninteresting.

Now for the Joker. Goddammit. I have seen a lot of Jokers, and this is the worst iteration of the Joker I’ve ever seen.

The best scene in the movie was the bar scene. The rest of the movie needed to be more like that.",4w86a7
d64w2uk,"I set my expectations very low. 

The setup: Obnoxious but undeniably fun and full of promise, if a bit frenetically edited, and the song choices came at the speed of someone flipping through a knockoff *Guardians of the Galaxy* playlist. Like many of the songs in *Guardians*, the choices were uninspired in how on-the-nose they were, although they got better as the movie developed. I do wish we didn't get the kinds of graphics and title cards that ruled the trailers: It just made the introductory act seem like a longer trailer. Still, a *good trailer* and it felt like we knew enough about the most important characters, and that anything could happen. The tone shifted every 30 seconds but I liked the expansive groundwork they set. 

It went to absolute shit. Harley and the Joker were declawed and watered down to the extreme, the henchmen were all Power Rangers, and the main villain was a green, mostly-CG, dancing Cleopatra. Will Smith's motivation changes from ""Fuck this"" to ""I'll kill you for keeping this very emotional thing from me!"" to ""I will help you"" in less than 4 minutes. It would've been a good arc if it had taken longer than one goddamn scene.

The sold-out audience cackled hysterically when Killer Croc crab-walked (croc-walked?) into the sewers, and was absolutely silent when he blurted, ""BET.""

There was a full 15 minutes where it looks like characters are going through some tumultuous moments, at what would be the characters' low points plot-wise, with generically ""morbid"" score not easing up, but I seriously could not figure out where everyone's attachments to each other came from. They just happened. I think the Flag/Deadshot dynamic was the only one that had any progression to it.

Lastly, this is a movie called *Suicide Squad* starring (supposed) **villains** in a hopeless situation, and it still ends on *every single character getting a happy ending.*

This movie makes me question enjoying *Guardians of the Galaxy*  - not *Deadpool*, because you can say this movie restructured after *Deadpool*'s success but you'd be wrong because that would imply that this movie had *even one similarly provocative or confident moment.*

The editing for blockbusters this year has to be the worst I've seen. It all now seems to be ""Now this is happening. Now that."" **ZERO** emotional context.

d659y7f,"One word can describe this for me: disappointing. This made me just how much Marvel has got the superhero movie thing down to a science- so much so that it almost seems impossible to mess up, but clearly it is.

I say ""disappointing"" because this cast could have been excellent. By all accounts, Leto really went all-in on his Joker portrayal. More credit to him, especially since (to my great surprise) his role amounts to little more than a cameo! Rather than a much more interesting conflict between the Squad and the Joker, with Harley (by far the standout character, though Deadshot is a close second) stuck in the middle, we get one of the lamest ""villains"" of any superhero movie I can remember seeing. Too powerful (then too easily destroyed) no personality, just a vague desire to take over everything.

He was such a wanna be mob boss. Where's his story arc about trying to antagonize Batman. Fucking Harley did all the work.

d64wc5p,"So I'll chime in with what I discussed with a friend after I saw Batman v Superman and what was reaffirmed after I saw Suicide Squad tonight; they're pulling the cart before the horse. 

What I think gets bogged down in the pacing issues that people talk about and why all these movies seem to be a general mess of things is that they're trying to do too much at once. I had this feeling that the people at Warner Bros felt like had they not ramped up their presence to be as strong as what Marvel and Disney were doing with their characters they'd be seen as copycats who caught on too late before the comic book bubble crashed.

I can see flaws in all comic books movies, but I feel like why the Marvel ensemble movies don't get bogged down with necessary pacing issues and convoluted characterization is because they did a slow roll. Before the Avengers movie(s) together, you got all the background of all the individual main characters, Iron-Man, Thor, Hulk, and Captain America and even got pieces of Black Widow and, to a lesser extent, Hawkeye. Thing is, that's just the main cast. You also have Pepper Potts, Happy Hogan, SHIELD, Nick Fury, Thor's lady friend and her scientist friends, Bucky, etc all seen and learned about in their own individual movies. Imagine trying to do so, in one movie, I'm sure you can imagine that it might bog a movie down if you tried to do too much with too little time.

So when a movie like Batman v Superman comes out and you kind feel like the Flash cameo was thrown in, and like you could've completely removed Wonder Woman from the entirety of the plot and the movie more than likely wouldn't have been any worse off for it, then you can see that packing in too much with too little movie running time almost takes a toll on the film as a whole. Maybe you don't like Jesse Einsenberg, no matter what, but maybe if there wasn't a Wonder Woman, maybe we get more focus on Luthor, maybe some of those deleted scenes don't get deleted. I think I understand the why Warner Bros and DC want to push this out, but I think the more that is ultimately crammed into every movie will see the same results that they've had with Batman v Superman, and now Suicide Squad.

As a side note: I thought Suicide Squad was ok. That's it. I don't usually get pumped about ANY movies, but when I left the theater with my friend the first thing I could think to say to her was, ""I can see why people wouldn't like this""

He seemed more like an actual crazy person instead of a cartoon character. The way the Squad interacted with each other were some of my favorite parts.

My biggest criticisms were the story pacing and the ending fight scenes. Also I would have loved if they got rid of a couple of characters and developed the others more - the focus was all on Deadshot and Harley. 

Overall, as a comic movie fan, not terrible. I'm not sure why it has such a low RT score. I'm sure the audience score will be much higher when it's activated. ",4w86a7
d64yenz,"I was so looking forward to this movie.

Everyone is going to have their own opinions, but here's mine: Suicide Squad feels like an over-long music video made by committee. I hated almost everything about it.

Here are the things I liked/didn't loathe: Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Jai Courtney (somehow). Their performances were good. Unfortunately the script was not.

Here are the things that didn't work for me: 

(1) The editing - seriously, this movie was so scattered, so incomprehensible at times, that I wouldn't be surprised if it was literally cut into scenes and reassembled after the fact by some corporate marketing team with no editing experience.

(2) The story - every superhero movie ever. It didn't differentiate itself in any way. The ""bad guys as heroes"" thing was such a ploy. They were, with the exception of El Diablo, basically just good guys who we were told, but never properly shown, were actually evil. Literally all of their actions throughout the movie belied their moniker as the ""bad guys,"" which kept getting shoved down our throats.

(3) Jared Leto - his laugh was creepy, I guess. Otherwise, his performance was just so boring. Like I didn't even care that the Joker was portrayed as a lame gangster pimp, he was actually just so boring to watch. A particular flashback with Harley made no sense and added nothing to the movie. That scene (ACE Chemicals) sums up this movie for me - all style, no substance. 

I actively hate this movie, and feel as if it deserves every bad review it gets. But again, I'm glad to hear some people loved it. God knows, I wouldn't wish my experience with the movie on my worst enemy. Literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And I really wanted to like it.",4w86a7
d64yk6e,"Pasting my thoughts from an earlier post, if that's okay. 

I saw it about a week ago at a special preview at WB, wanted to save my thoughts until the review embargo was up out of respect for the people who got me the screening tickets.

DISCLAIMER: I came into the film about 15 minutes late. Based on knowledge from trailers and context clues in the film I know pretty much exactly what I missed, but that still might have tarnished my impression of the film.

The Good:

Will Smith/Deadshot. He is by far the most grounded and relatable character in the film. His charisma brings a casual charm to a film which is otherwise very tonally unbalanced. He steals the show in most of his scenes (which is not necessarily a good thing for the story, but damn if Smith isn't fun to watch).

Viola Davis. Her portrayal of Amanda Waller is spot-on, and they really didn't pull any punches with her character.

The cinematography. This is by far one of, if not the best-looking super hero films that I've ever seen. Ayer and Vasyanov really made it their own, and aside from some questionable CGI towards the end, they've really done a lot with DC's mandated ""dark and gritty"" style.

The Bad:

The Script. As unpredictable as this film seemed based on the trailers, the plot is disappointingly straightforward. Pivotal scenes are clearly cut and none of the characters are done justice. 

Character management. DC desperately tried to make this like GotG or The Avengers, but this film does a much poorer job of managing its ensemble cast. GotG worked because it had a clear main character and only 5 people on the team; SS has 7+ and none of them is really a clear protagonist (Deadshot is the closest we get, but even he is underdeveloped).

Margot Robbie/Harley Quinn. It really kills me to say this, because I was so excited to finally see a live action Harley Quinn, but Margot Robbie is just poorly used and, frankly, annoying in this film. There's never a really compelling explanation as to why she's on the team (even Black Widow had stuff to do in The Avengers). They try desperately to make her a sympathetic, redeemable character, but never quite commit; the result is a weird, forced performance and several character decisions that come completely out of left field.

Cara Delivingne/Enchantress. Horribly miscast. I like Delivigne and Enchantress' design is cool, but her character is a lot more shallow than we've been lead to believe by promotional material, and they miss a lot of opportunities to do anything interesting with her powers.

The Soundtrack. Bohemian Rhapsody and other great 80's rock songs are criminally misused in the film, and don't blend well with the bizarre modern punk/pop rock used in scenes with Harley Quinn and The Joker. A lot of their scenes feel like a bad music video for an MCR song. I seriously suspect that the tone of this film was drastically different in the first draft/cut (similar to what we saw in the first trailer), but was changed in post due to studio interference after BvS. The result is a film that was originally intended to be much more Ayer-esque with an unapologetically dark, somber tone, but was retroactively changed to match the neon-punk, ""comic book-y"" vibe that we've been getting from the more recent trailers and posters. The direction. I don't know if this is the fault of Ayer, who I normally enjoy, or studio interference, but the action scenes in SS feel terribly clunky. They're trying hard to match the ""fight-quip-fight-quip"" style that Marvel has mastered, but it doesn't work with this tone. Forced jokes (many of which we've seen in trailers) bring the action to a halt, causing many scenes (particularly the big bad boss fight at the end) to feel cartoony -- in a bad way.

The Meh:

Jared Leto/The Joker. Leto's performance is underwhelming, apparently his shining moment came early on in the film so I might have missed it. His portrayal of The Joker isn't awful, but feels incredibly derivative of Ledger's (they made a big deal about how hard he worked to change his laugh, but it sounds the same as Ledger's to me). I still hate his design, and he was so inconsequential to the whole film. The more I think about it the more I vote we never see him again. 

The rest of the team. Rick Flag is as boring as he seems in the trailers. Killer Croc and Katana really don't get much to do at all, and their ""crucial roles"" in the final act seem forced. El Diablo is cool early on, but his arc is pretty predictable. Captain Boomerang was actually incredibly likeable and charismatic, but super underused and inconsequential to the plot. Was Slipknot in this film?

Overall, the film was not godawful and certainly not as bad as BvS, but was ultimately really disappointing. A lot of wasted potential and failure to commit to certain themes/plot points. After my first screening I told myself I'd go back to the theater to watch it and catch the first 15 minutes, but since then I've started to lose interest.

There is no need to rush anything when DC has a developed and loyal fanbase.",4w86a7
d64znao,"I have to give it a resounding meh. I didn't care for the vast majority of the characters and especially the villain. Oh yet another evil entity is channeling a giant ring in the sky to destroy the world for some reason. Yawn.

 None of the action is particularly impressive, just some zombie smashing without any great set pieces to really stand out. The big positives are Will Smith and Margot Robbie, and i really liked the tone/style of the first half until it comes down to a generic boss raid/fight.

d64zxe3,"Spoiler Warning:  It was a step in the right direction.  This movie is no Green Lantern and it's better than BvS.  There are pacing issues but I think it was due to trying to fit too many character stories in.

Overall the movie only suffered from two things: Joker and overall bad guy. 

Either put Joker in the whole movie or tease him in flashbacks with foreshadowing for future movies but don't half ass both.

You could tell they just wanted a supernatural bad guy. Also they didn't accurately explain why Flash, Batman, or Wonder Woman didn't show up to fight.

The objective of their mission changing felt very fitting for a squad of that type. Starting off to rescue a secret VIP, then have to protect Waller and her chopper out, then to find Waller, then stop Enchantress after finding out that Flagg and Waller were inadvertently behind the situation in the first place.

d654vyu,"Saw it yesterday. Slightly disappointed but it was enjoyable. Better than BvS. As was mentioned in most reviews; the editing seems very heavy handed. It's like they had to cut an hour off the movie and they just set up an automated process to cut 25% off of each scene. It feels very messy and choppy at times. 

The trailers were a lot better. 

Deadshot: Pretty cool. Had some badass moments. The 'I'm actually a good guy' arc with the kid was a bit heavy-handed but I didn't mind that too much. 

Harley: Most of the big/fun moments were in the trailers. A lot of the other ones fell on their face but maybe that was just in the theater I was in; the rest of the crowd just wasn't feeling it. She was the most enjoyable character for me though. 

Harley's ass: deserves to be mentioned. When it is on screen it steals the show and is absolutely fabulous. 

Joker: I tried to avoid most of the trailers so I was under the impression he was the main villain. I liked Leto's performance; crazy, scary, unhinged and yet calculated and clearly very dangerous. 

Enchantress/June: unexpected main villain. Overall pretty decent performance. Shame if the Enchantress char is actually dead because there's a lot of potential there. 

Enchantress' brother: very CGI'y. Uncanny valley. 

Waller: badass bitch. Great performance. 

Diablo: pretty cool. His big moment was badass. 

Killer Croc: he didn't do that much but acted and looked pretty cool. 

Captain Boomerang: meh. Captain Mild Comic Relief. Captain Generic Criminal. I think I saw a boomerang once or twice.  

Slipknot: well. I kinda feel sorry for the actor having to explain to his friends and family why he was even featured on any of the marketing material. 

Katana: ok I guess but kinda pointless. Her backstory felt forced in and the movie would have been the same if she wasn't in there. Looks like she was just there so Harley had a sword to pick up at the end of the movie. 

The 2 Justice League cameo's: pretty cool. Batffleck is great and the other guy looked pretty decent. 

And that's how I would summarize the movie. Just 'pretty cool'. I'm slightly disappointed and it feels like wasted potential, like the theatrical version of BvS. Hopefully there will be an ultimate cut of this one too because clearly a LOT of material was cut. ",4w86a7

But there have to be some changes....No end of the world-type villains. Save that for the Justice League. I mean, the Suicide Squad is hardly suitable to take out a Superman-level threat like Waller claimed they could. Take a cue from Ant-Man and do something smaller in scale. Maybe a heist film or something along those lines. Possibly make the Joker the villain in the sequel with Harley vacillating between both sides (idk, just spitballing). Also, commit to a tone. Suicide Squad should be fairly dark, and WB, show some balls and make it rated R. Let Ayer off the fucking leash. Give Ayer the time he needs to flesh out the script. Make it more of an ensemble than the Will Smith show. Smith was great, but none of the other characters got much development outside Deadshot, Diablo, and Robbie. Live up to the title. It's called SUICIDE Squad yet only one main squad member dies in combat (Slipknot died before the shooting went down so he does not count)? Come on. And add some new characters. Jessica Chastain as Poison Ivy would be dope, for instance. Give us Deathstroke. And let's see some innovative action sequences.

That scene made no sense, at what point did they establish any sort of friendship let alone one that's more meaningful than him wanting to get back into his daughter's life. He kills people for money, but not for his daughter, is that what the movie was telling us? Also the scene right after where everyone else smirks that will ""missed"" like he did the right thing because they are all buddy buddies now.

This movie is full of characters that's act out of character. Like when boomerang left in the bar scene, I actually thought that was funny because it made sense with his character only to have it ruined the very next scene with him coming back for some reason. Mind you this character was built up first by having him kill another robber he was working with to get more money.

The joker made no sense, like what was he even doing before he went after Harley? He was just at a bar killed a dude for no reason and then goes driving dangerously and crashes into the water. Like how was this guy supposed to be some big crime boss? Also the scene where he's on the floor with a bunch of knives circled around him, those were there to foreshadow what was going to happen later in the movie right? We were going to see just how bad of a guy joker is right?

d65n5mz,"DISCLAIMER: If you enjoy the movie then great, don't take this as me trying to tell you why you're wrong, I can see how someone could enjoy it.

This movie isn't as bad as BvS. That doesn't mean it's any good. I was worried that this movie would be 2 acts of character work then a third act where they shoot a horde of enemies and work their way towards the main objective. What I got was 2 acts of them shooting hordes of enemies and an attempt at character work in the bar.

It's monotonous - using the same beats over and over again. 3 Helicopter crashes, multiple introductions to characters, 2 lots of Joker goons in costumes shooting at people, slow motion shots of each member in the squad bashing in a goon's head, an outdoor action scene in which the Squad shoots at non descript CGI blobs for a good few minutes then Deadshot stands on a car and just shoots in different directions while Flag is dragged away, an indoor action scene just a few minutes after in which all of that happens aside from Deadshot standing on a car.

It's been hacked to pieces, but even if it's put back together I don't think it'll make a difference. They don't feel like bad guys. We're told that they're bad guys, heck there are more lines telling us that Croc is one mean guy than he actually has in the movie. Captain Boomerang fucks off the second he's allowed to, but then he comes back because he has a beer - which contradicts the fact he's looking to leave and not participate. Enchantress builds a swirly vortex of death because that's what blockbusters do. Apparently Waller waits 2/3 days before sending the squad in. The flashback is even worse than the Martha one in BvS. That said, the second act twist is a nice one.

While I'm on positives, I guess Deadshoot, Harley and Waller are pretty good.

I was bored before the second act even started and it only got worse from there. Imagine Guardians as a student film - it's missing all the character work between the action beats, there's no real difference between locales, the music is used for no reason creating severe tonal whiplash, it's poorly lit and the cinematography is awful - close framing when your protagonists are fighting things just makes it look like one thing fighting another thing. This is 'The Room' of modern day Superhero movies.

That's it. I don't care anymore about this cynical universe, I don't want to watch Wonder Woman lose faith in humanity come next June, this is the third strike. They're out.

Let me know when the DCEU reboots.

It's a fun movie, that's just average and enjoyable as far as superhero films go it doesn't bring anything refreshing to the table, but it's an enjoyable flick and worth your money if you're a fan of the franchise and the characters. It's main flaws is that the first act is choppy as fuck, awful editing with really sloppy use of great songs, and poor introductions to characters that you should care for a lot.

d684xj0,"Just saw it. Bullet points review; 

- The editing, pacing, tone shifts, CGI and 90 percent of the script is a complete disaster. The first two thirds has some of the most muddled, confusing, all over the place story telling I've ever seen in a movie; the last third is just boring bullshit inner city comic book movie climax. 

- The soundtrack is cool, but it's used to punctuate almost every single beat of the film, to the point where it gets a bit overwhelming and forced. Which leads me to my next point;

- Everything, from Jokers hand tattoo to the surprise camaraderie and friendship between these hardened criminals after knowing each other for 6 hours is forced. So fucking forced. Anakin/Padme levels of forced. Almost every line of dialogue is cringe inducing.

- Margot Robbie could be a good Harley Quinn, but the script she has to work with is cringe inducing bullshit. Leto is a completely boring Joker. Will Smith does the Will Smith thing, he's watchable (but he's not playing Floyd Lawton). I fucking love Captain Boomerang, mostly because he seems like he's in on how much of a joke the film is and chugs tall cans. Viola Davis is a great Amanda Waller, to the point where she seems too good for this film. Every single other character is a non entity, and a waste of screen time. I can't believe how shitty Killer Croc is handled, in particular.

- I'm not ultra PC or anything, but the way Harley Quinn is treated is pretty friggen gross. Feels like 50% of the screen time is devoted to her ass, and her licking things suggestively. It feels like something out of a bad grindhouse film, or a porno. El Diablo, Katana and Captain Boomerang are racial stereotypes to a laughable extreme but that's accurate to the comics so... Meh. What can you do. 

- The villain is a joke. Worst I've seen in a comic film since Malaketh, and worst CGI I've seen since Doomsday.

- Things I liked; Amanda Waller, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot. Things I hated; just about everything else. 

Overall, a complete disaster of a movie. I liked Batman V Superman more then this movie, and I HATED Batman V Superman. This honestly sits at the Electra/Green Lantern level of comic book films for me. A bad movie and a bad adaptation all rolled together.

Three strikes and I am officially getting off of the crazy DC cinematic universe train. I'm not going to see these movies anymore, unless they pull a Rebirth style reboot. I don't care how cool Wonder Woman looks; these movies always LOOK cool. I just don't wanna support this shit anymore.

The incubus is resistant to fire but a bomb that was blown with some concrete in the way was enough to kill it? Enchantress was resistant to gunfire but a knife slash exposed the heart immediately? And are we to believe that the sorry excuse of a joker we saw has killed a robin, and eluded a more powerful version of batman many times? He looked like a stoned wannabe gangster whose only power seems to be magically teleporting out of crashing vehicles.

d6652cn,"I haven't read the source material so I'm looking at the film from a standalone PoV.

The movie just seems so rough and unrefined. Every time there was an emotional or intimate moment that could have been profound it was ruined by awkward dialogue or pacing or mood or etc. Many of the characters are either undefined or cliche as hell. 

Will Smith's daughter troubles seem to exist just for the sake of a psychological soft spot. Like that last moment when he's about to shoot the explosives, he gets interfered by his daughter's message about not killing anyone, but he had no problem shooting 100 other henchmen?

When they first enter the ""warzone"" and their helicopter immediately gets taken down, the shot of Viola in the control room with a mortified face is actually hilarious. Like they didn't even touch the ground yet and her magnus opus as a clandestine organizer already gets wiped out. It just seems like unnecessary drama. Like can you hold the audience's attention for a few minutes without explosions?

The entire objective of the mission is to get Amanda Waller's own ass out safely? They have no interest in dealing with the big trash vortex in the middle of the city?

Did the scuba diver who set off the explosive get killed or was he in 2 seconds able to get away from an explosion that went through a meter of concrete to kill a witch that was totally impervious to bullets?

The character's super powers aren't very well defined. The Australian guy just throws assorted boomerangs, has knives, and fights well? The crocodile guy is just really strong and can hold his breath underwater. Harley Quinn is just good at fighting with a baseball bat and an infinite ammo revolver.",4w86a7
d667qid,"I was pleasantly surprised, I had pretty low expectations and the move wasn't awful. I felt like a lot of character intro may have gotten cut out for Katana and Slipknot. I also thought Rick Flag was pretty useless out there. One of the bigger problems was there was no flashback as to how the Enchantress and her brother came to be, no info on her brother before he was released and no motivation other than kill everyone. And why build a machine when you're a goddamn sorcerer?",4w86a7
d668ujs,"This movie was aggressively terrible just about the whole way through. Some of the setpieces were neat, and I really liked how enchantress looked at the beginning. Thats about all I can say in the positive.

The dialogue was terrible, there was no worthwhile character development. The section where they introduce the squad is broken up into 2 or 3 different parts of the movie (why?). They go way too into detail on the backstories of just Harley and Deadshot, and I ended up not caring that much about either. The Australian dude and the guy who does knots and stuff didn't even get an introduction i think. Its just a dude with a boomerang, and this other guy whos grumpy.

Spoilers: the final fight was shit. Although Diablo's transformation was pretty neat, the visions they were given were kind of dumb. Especially Harley's - a normal life with a marriage and 2 kids? If thats what she wants, how in the HELL does she fall in love with the Joker?

Anyway, I was pretty irritated that I wasted 2 hours watching this. I almost left half way through (what, another hour to go?) but I stayed in the hope that at least there would be a sweet fight. But there wasn't. I would have rather stayed home and taken a 2 hour nap. At least then I'd get something out of it.


EDIT: Oh I forgot about the part where they have a flashback to 15 minutes earlier in the movie. That was pretty terrible",4w86a7

-some cringey moments that could have been written better. ex: when harley pretended to be bowing to the enchantress but decides not to and says something along the lines of ""theyre my frieeeends!!"" Could have said something better, but w.e

Will smith brought a lot of charisma to the movie and really elevated it from mediocre action movie to something pretty good same way he elevated the first Independence Day. El Diablo brought some surprising heart to the movie. Katana also had a really interesting back story and I am very interested to know more about this portrayal of her. Jai Courtney was good in this. Like holy shit. Always thought he was Sam Worthington 2.0. Killer croc was meh, had some funny lines but pretty underwhelming in the end. While The Joker wasn't in this movie as much as I thought I feel like Jared Leto can give an amazing performance if given more to work with. Really the only main problems with the movie are the overuse of licensed songs and the villain. Sometimes the licensed songs worked well like when Black Skinhead was playing while Deadshot was shooting the targets. But sometimes they seemed off and made the scene feel more like a music video. Seems like they tried to copy GOTG but it worked better in that movie because the soundtrack was actually part of the plot. The villain was also weak. They were keeping the villain in mystery the whole time not because it would be surprising even tho everyone guessed right that the villain was Enchantress (also wasted her potential imo) but because of how underwhelming she was. Overall it was good. 7/10 I guess. Best DCCU movie so far. Hopefully Wonder Woman can be DCCU's first great movie. ",4w86a7

The fight between Diablo and the Entrantress's brother (don't know his name) was pretty cool. I've read where people thought the villains were weak, but I didn't think so. If I had to say a con, then it would be Deadshot's scenes with the daughter.",4w86a7

d64yyo1,"My biggest problem is I felt the movie did not know what it wanted to do. It acted like it wanted to breeze by the characters and get straight to the action but then some characters would get 10 minutes of a back story while others would get a minute at most. Granted the people getting the most screen time are Will Smith and Margot Robbie since they are the most popular actors. 

I think Leto's Joker had two sides that were both good, but separately. He portrayed a great drug lord Joker and great psycho Jack Nicholson Joker, but then you combine them and get crap. His laugh got annoying after they played it back to back for the second time. It sounds incredibly fake, like no actual person (insane or not) would have that as a laugh. 

Margot Robbie was the worst part about this; she was incredibly annoying and added literally nothing to plot. She was only there to add Joker (unless she is in the Squad in the comics), and Joker didn't even need to be in this movie. Margot Robbie is not a good actress; she is a good sex object and having her ass hang out for over half the movie is basically the extent of her character. 

Overall, the movie fails because it does focus on the title it is a movie about a SQUAD of characters not two. Deadshot and Harley Quinn have more screen time than any other character and El Diablo's motivation for the ending is definitely forced because of it. This is probably the worst part and makes me so mad. It is very obvious all the actors have chemistry together, but they are given basically no screen time to advance the chemistry. The bar scene in the trailer is the first time they really get to talk to each other besides quips. However, Deadshot is the best part about this movie since Will Smith nails every scene he is in. 

Also while I am not a PC guy in any sense of the word, this movie had some very weird stereotypes. El Diable was very obviously hispanic, Killer Croc was for some reason enforced to be African American, Katana was the Asian, and Slipknot was Native American (and very weirdly killed first). 

This movie is a 5/10. It is better than BvS, but DC is trying so hard to play catch up all their movies are being ruined because of it. Especially since its weird to be hinting at the Justice League when their is already a trailer out for it. ",4w86a7

Had high hopes that it would be somewhat dark and gritty, but it felt like it pandered to kids and toned itself way down so parents would be okay with the oh so ""threatening"" title. Editing was outrageously childish and ruined good, dramatic scenes like the asylum break with the torturing of Harley Quinn, or the strip club scene. The music and editing destroyed any merit that Jared Leto could have brought to the table as the joker. The soundtrack was fine, but sometime they put the score where it did NOT need to be: as in the bar scene when Diablo tells his story, or when the guards torture Harley in the flashback at the beginning of the story.

The characters themselves were flat, with the exception of Deadshot, who I think made the story worth it in the end. Katana is grossly under sold since a good revenge background would fit perfectly in the story with everyone having some sort of vendetta against Batman, which they barely showcased.

All in all, they pandered and sacrificed what could've been a chance of redemption for DC's trademark of dark story telling, in trade for setting up a Marvel franchise clone that doesn't fit the tone of the DC universe.

Also, many plot holes. The biggest one being: if the commander had the heart of the witch and is so menacing that she murdered her own squad members, why wouldn't she destroy the heart as soon as things went wrong?

After club scene, Waller says ""and that was just the beginning"" but Quinn gets captured by Batman two seconds later?). That was also one of the the laziest expositions I've ever seen. They were like ""how are we going to introduce all these characters? I know lets just have Waller tell everyone's story at the beginning and be done with it.""

The villain's dialogue was atrocious: ""Soon my weapon will be finished and I will rule the world!!"" (all it was missing was the cheesy muwahaha at the end). I don't need to mention her dancing. And her brother looked like a monster from that Egyptian episode of Duck Tales. The rest of the dialogue was so ""on the nose/in your face."" I am not a five year old, I don't need everything spelled out for me.

While I liked Leto's joker, there was no reason for Joker to be in the movie at all because he added absolutely NOTHING to the plot. He kidnapped Harley for like 60 seconds and then she was like ""lolol hai I'm back you guys."" Was that necessary? Did it add anything to the plot?

The cuts made no sense. I heard that after the trailers were such a big hit, the execs fired the editors of the film and hired the guys who cut the trailer to edit it. They used the exact same music from the trailers too which I thought was lame. There were almost no instances of actual score. Also, you can tell where the reshoots were cut in. Every time someone had a snappy one liner, it was a close up on that character: obvious reshot.

I will say the acting was pretty good on everyone's part. I loved Leto's Joker. Too bad so many of his scenes got cut. Everyone's criticizing him for laughing too much, but his scenes were so sparse that there was no time for him to really go deep into that character. The only weak link, acting wise, was the witch and I attribute that partially to her bad CGI/voice effects/horrendous dialogue. Also, thought Will Smith should have played Rick Flagg instead of Deadshot. He did a great job at playing Will Smith and Flagg is more similar to Smith than Deadshot.

And why was the CGI so horrendous? They promoted the everliving shit out of this movie, had tons of big name actors, and that's the best CGI they could afford???

I'm also dreading the publicity for the Justice league. They pushed it so hard in BVS, pushed it hard here. I'm already sick of it. 

The other thing that I was afraid of before I even saw the movie (which I was right to be afraid of) was that they pretty much showed us the entire movie in all the billions of trailers they released for this movie. I felt like I had seen half the movie already.",4w86a7

Ending was predictable as hell. Also, why did Killer Croc want BET?",4w86a7
d66q187,"I really enjoyed this movie, the story was a weak shell and final the confrontation with Enchantress was silly. The characters themselves were really well done though, it was enjoyable to just watch Harley be Harley, Deadshot do ridiculous things with guns.
The scene with the Joker and Harley in the club at the begging was AMAZING. You have no idea what The Joker is going to do, or how he truly feels at any moment. I loved it.
Not every movie is supposed to be an oscar contender, this was just a solid popcorn comic book movie",4w86a7
d66twy9,"To me the lowest point of this film was the thug, pimp wannabe that was the Joker.  This in no way represents ANY iteration of the Joker to me.  Nicholson and Ledger still hold the crown for clown of crime.  I recall there being backlash over all the tattoos then Ayer said they weren't in the film, and guess what....That's right it's in the film!  

The rest of the movie was enjoyable, I didn't check the time to see how much longer I had to wait till the end.  I certainly see why it was panned, but calling it worse then Fant4stic is a little over the top in my opinion.  I've had a bad feeling about this since Ayer threw a fit over the Comic Con trailer being released.  Snyder was hyped to show people and Ayer got butt hurt.  ",4w86a7
d677uxl,"Overall great cast.

Didn't want to shoot myself watching Jai Courtney for once +1

Margot Robbie **is** Harley Quinn. They really could have used her better.

Jared Leto performed admirably as the Joker. Not a bad addition to the actor line. 

Will Smith playing Will Smith dressed up as deadshot. I enjoyed watching him though. 

Music was alright, more like a mixtape.

Didn't hate the movie, didn't love the movie. It was just barely okay. There was plenty of potential with the strong cast but the screenplay was lacking. Also the editing was sometimes all over the place so it was obvious that there were 2 running versions at some point.

I wanted to like Batman v Superman, going so far to see it three times in theaters to make sure I disliked it as much as I did. But this was worse. The pacing issues are on a whole nother level in Suicide Squad. Supposedly Ayer had 6 weeks to write the script.

The editing was superb and flawless. The plot was mind blowing with twists and turns that you never see coming! By the 3rd act, the movie just made me say ""THANK YOU DC! You fan loving, director friendly, pioneer of a Company who cares about us Fans!""

I was really happy that the ensemble cast - EVERY character in the movie was fleshed out. I totally get why Katana was doing what she was doing. Captain Boomerang was also memorable and had some bad ass scenes! And Slipknots introduction really blew me away! Dont even get me started on Enchantress! She was the BEST comic book villain ever on screen! Cara Delevingnes performance is Oscar worthy! And Joker is the best Joker ever! Not even Comic Joker or Hamill Joker can reach that level of Greatness that Leto provided!

As a lover of film in general, I really am so proud of this movie Universe that Dc created and pioneered! Dc obviously cares about the artistic quality of films, creativity of directors, and just make Film Masterpieces of Cinema! Money is the last thing on their mind. All Hail DC!",4w86a7
d64z6dv,"Overall, I'd give it a 6.5-7/10.

What didn't work for me was:

- Odd pacing/tone/editing (it seemed like every character was given a specific tone in close up scenes that was tonally inconsistent with the rest of the movie).
- Deadshot/Will Smith. You know, actually, just Will Smith. He is not Deadshot. He was just Will Smith playing a hit man, that's it. Fuck you Will Smith for playing yourself as a hit man—use your range as an actor (I know you got the skill man, just fucking use it).
- Lack of Joker/Lack of fully exploring Joker and Harley's relationship. Leto as the Joker is serviceable. Doesn't compare at all with Ledger's Joker (will never reach that level of amazing). It seems like a lot of Joker material was cut and I was pissed about that. I was also confused on some of their clips showing Joker and Harley's bonding at the asylum (seemed very glossed over and like she was crazy already before he even put her through shock therapy...I don't agree with that personally. That was a dumb route to go).

What did work for me:

- Amanda Waller (I want batman to punch her in the face, and that's setting the correct characterization for her, bravo).
- Usage of the squad (although, it seems like material was cut showing the cleanup and how waller needed bruce's help to do it).
- Harley, Boomerang, Diablo & Croc (loved them, especially Diablo).
- Enchantress powers (though her motivations were shit, her powers were pretty cool and I'd love to see her fight the trinity).
- The Joker. He had fucking awesome goons, and his weird obsession/love for harley was displayed very well. I want more of that.",4w86a7
d64zywk," I feel like this is one of those movies where it might take a year or two for people to realize how truly awful it is. Was it boring? Not at all. My friend and I were geeking out the last half hour and were completely entertained. But you could say the same thing for Batman and Robin. 
 The squad was a weak group of people that weren't even that mean. The villain was one of the strangest and most awkward villains in a superhero movie I've seen in a LONG time. There were constant cringeworthy attempts at humor and drama. Just about every other scene had the stereotypical ""get hype!"" song to cheat the audience into saying ""fuck yeah!!"". I mean it was just truly awful. That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy seeing it. Every single time that crocodile opened its mouth to talk black I was in tears... But don't try to sit here and make it out to be some mediocre movie haha come on now you guys ",4w86a7
d68dzeq,"I think the story would of been better set out as a Netflix series, giving more details and information about each character and their background story. 
The idea of the movie I was pleased with, the acting was good, but the editing and camera work wasn't 100%. ",4w86a7
d68n598,"Just finished watching it. IMO this movie was BAD. So bad. There was very little character development so I didn't care about most of the characters. Villain's motivations were not fleshed out. Joker didn't need to be in this movie at all. Also I thought it was a bad interpretation. Their relationship was too lovey-dovey in the first place. The joker I know is not trying his hardest to bust Harley out of prison(3x) because he loves her. She's supposed to be a plaything, something he only keeps around cause she's entertaining or useful. Also, there's no element of chaos to the Joker. The unpredictability is what makes him scary in the Nolan films. When he was sitting around the guns and knives were so ordered and straight and organized. Not to mention his appearance, he's dressed like a very well groomed pimp, with is hair slicked back and makeup put on like he spent a lot of time on it. Where's the chaos, where's the 'some men just want to watch the world burn' element? I also thought Harley could have been a lot crazier. In the movie they say she's crazier than him but they're both super tame. Smith at Deadshot and Amanda Waller were good. However, I thought Amanda could have been more competent. She was appropriately scary, but having a million things go wrong and fall to pieces just isn't like her at all.

Why is DC trying so hard to be Marvel. It smacks of so much desperation and I just feel awful for them because it is not working. For another thing, DC does great animated movies. Assault on Arkham is about the Suicide Squad and it's a hell of a lot better and more mature. Why not put that in theaters? Or do that same thing with live actors. You've already made a good Suicide Squad movie, so use it. I'm disappointed and looking at the trailers for Justice League tells me it's going to be more of the same. ",4w86a7
d64tvqt,There is a mid credit scene though,4w86a7
d64u8m3,"Viola Davis easily stole the show. Waller was a much more fearful villain than that ancient sibling duo.

P.S. One of my favourite parts were Deadshot and Black Skinhead, that was awesome. 
",4w86a7
d64un1m,"Better then expected. I think I'd give the movie an overall 5/10 but personally the stuff surrounding the climax was like 2/10 for me. Bits of it got really cringy for me. I got out my ""standard movie formula checklist"" part way into the climax.

So I really get why it's been panned by reviews. Rotten Tomatos is a review aggravate and right now only 28% of reviewers gave an overall positive review. However, the average rating is 4.8/10 which isn't that bad when you consider the %. The part that caused this is the middle. There's room to critize other bits but they worked well enough. However, there's a point in the middle where it badly feels like the thread has been lost, we are on step G, and we skip over to step P. It's at this point when they are trying to push forward a bunch of tiny personal stories for each character and lose track of the original story. [spoiler]About when Deadshot ""misses"" to when happy surprise twist music plays is filled with this.[/spoiler]

Part of my issue is that they tried so hard to make the characters like-able and didn't let them really be badguys. My understanding is there was a darker cut left behind and I really wish that was the movie that I went to see today. If that cut gets released on DvD then I'll seek it out.

Despite all that I also really get why the actors where defending it. They remember all the scenes they acted in and I'm sure they put some great cuts out there. I firmly believe DC's issue with comic book movies right now is in the editing room. Can't tell whose at fault as a viewer though.",4w86a7
d64v06o,"Personally I really enjoyed Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Most of deadshot and el diablo. The movie suffered from bad storytelling and writing and felt like a lot was left on the cutting room floor.
*Spoilers*
I thought that the enchantress was a mediocre villan and even though she was destroying the world the stakes felt low. All of the family friendship shit like boomerang coming back after leaving and diablo dying for his new family felt weird because there wasnt really a strong relationship established between the characters. The joker was pointless other than setting up for more films. Bad storytelling was my biggest problem. Slipknot not getting an introduction then dying to show they mean business was obvious and poorly done. It made it feel like the movie didn't have stakes.

It just didn't feel like the Joker I've read and seen portrayed in other media. I don't think I laughed once during his time on screen. I get that the Joker is a homicidal maniac, but he's a funny one. Maybe it was because his limited screen time. There were some things that were shown in trailers and behind the scene footage that were definitely cut out.",4w86a7
d64wtjt,"I thought the movie was Okay.

The thing that I like about this movie is character Interactions, I like when Harley banter with her teammates. Also Will Smith was standout in this movie and thankfully he did not hog the spotlight and I can understand his motivation.

Jai Courtney surprisingly decent in this movie as a jerk Aussie. Jared Leto as Joker was fine even he was only like 5 to 7 minutes in a movie.

Unfortunately this movie suffers from narrative issue. The introduction scene could be little bit faster and the scene is like from YouTube video and felt out of place. Some Characters were underdeveloped like Katana and Killer Croc. The scene where Harley saw the chemicals and then jumped to flash backs kinda break the flows in the second act.

Also, the romance between Rick Flagg and June Moone was unconvincing. I think Enchantress is badly written in this movie. I wish there was more teamwork in this movie.

Overall, if you are the fan of the Genre and DC, I think you are going to like this movie.

I'm a comic fan, so I knew a lot of the backstory, but someone coming into the movie without any knowledge might have been confused at points.  Also some of the character's motivations seemed forced (people who barely spent any time together and never really talked immediately considered themselves not only a team but a ""family"", and I really felt Deadshot near the end deciding to be a hero just for the joy/prestige of being a hero was waay out of character), but understand it was necessary to move the story along.

It was definitely a fun spectacle visually (though a little muddy) and action wise, and both Margot Robbie and Cara Delevingne provided nice eye candy.

In fact, he just comes off as an overly eccentric gangster who put on Mommy's makeup and who cares way too much about Harley, and not acting like the Clown Prince of Crime.) After capturing Harley unconscious, Batman forcibly kisses her as she wakes up. What the fuck, Batman?

The humor at times felt a little out of place but not nearly as bad as anything a saw in civil war. But everyone is entitled to their own opinions I guess. BATFLECK!!!,4w86a7
d673egd,Seeing the movie concluded for me what I've been saying for years... They need to offer the Joker role to Daniel Day Lewis. The only potential downside is that we may actually see him become a deranged terrorist in his insane method acting but I think the performance would be the best since and possibly better than Heath Ledgers Joker. Certainly better than the yuppie gangster wannabe performance we are seeing in Suicide Squad.,4w86a7
d673pqs,"No idea why people buy so much into Will Smith's performance, he was just literally being himself. He didn't seem like a cold-hearted and calculated killer,  and he was not cynical like someone of his role should be (imo).

The criminals didn't even seem like hardcore criminals, what I wanted was a bunch of cynical assholes that only cared for themselves and who would fight a lot with each other with co-operation issues etc. But no, there was no character development and they clicked immediately. Just so bad and disappointing.

I would say most of the performances here was at the same level as Anakin in Star Wars, extremly stiff and forgettable. Its just a complete mess and deserves all the negative critic it has recieved.",4w86a7
d67403a,"Just got back from seeing it. The movie was fine. I can't say it was bad, but I can't say it was anywhere near as good as it could have been. That, for me, sums up DC movies - a lot of potential, rarely met.

The plot wasn't anything interesting, and I know Ayers had little time to write it, but I really wish we'd seen something more interesting than ""a giant bomb is going to kill everybody."" I actually would have preferred something a little more low-key. I don't need to see an entire city or the planet threatened every time.

I thought the cast as a whole were great. Much love for Viola Davis; I want to see as much of Amanda Waller in future as possible. Diablo had a lot of potential and I really hope we see more of him. Same for Enchantress, but we can ditch the utterly pointless CGI brother.

Leto's Joker interested me, and I'd like to see more of him, especially alongside Harley Quinn. Robbie had some great moments in this film, and I think that sums up the movie as a whole for me: great moments dotted throughout an inoffensive, sometimes lacklustre film.",4w86a7

Leto was pretty good as Joker in the scenes that showed him transitioning between laughter and intimidation (e.g the nightclub and kitchen scenes). That's a huge part of the Joker character, he can turn from laughter to anger and back to laughter all of a sudden, which is what makes him unpredictable. In other scenes he sort of lacked energy, e.g the ace chem. scene and the plane crash scene.

Katana felt so tacked on, the way they introduced her by having her jump on the plane last minute and Flag being like 'oh yeah by the way this is katana her sword traps souls' wasn't much. 

Aside from that I actually didn't mind the way they changed Deadshot to make him more personable and relatable.

But GOD DAMN did they wear out the ""play cool rock song over action scene/mini montage"" thing. It was cool at first but I was really sick of it after the 10th time.

Also, there were some seriously missed ops, like the scene of Harley Quinn dreaming of the perfect life with the Jared Leto, should have definitely kept him in full Joker makeup. That was a huge tonal mistake IMO.

In comparison, I didn't really find Leto's Joker interesting, though I definitely would like to see more of him. I also liked the Enchantress as the villain, I loved the design and the duality of the character was interesting. This movie was fun, I really think, that if we can see the director's original cut, it will be a solid movie.

I'm rolling my eyes at this point, just stop trying to be funny every 2 minutes I'm thinking or at least have something else to say. I guess I'm a bit annoyed but it did have some good bits, I'd say the mid section of the film was the best for me. I'll give it a 6 out of 10... DC shouldn't put so many characters in their films...

Not the greatest superhero flick but a fun two hours that didn't take itself too seriously. Was not bored.

Deadshot, Diablo and Amanda Waller were my favourite characters but I felt almost everyone did a really good job. I cared about the fate of this team and I think that's really important. 

Doesn't come without its flaws though. The beginning with the ""sizzle reel"" for each character was horrible, the CGI left a lot to be desired especially at the end and Joker should have had more screen time or should have been left out of the film entirely (I do like what Jared Leto did with the character though so I hope we get to see more of him). Also some flashbacks, while done well, came out of nowhere and slowed the movie down too much. Also Cara Delevine was terrible.

I liked most of the main cast except for Jared Leto and Cara Delevigne.

I wasn't disappointed by the Joker because to be honest I was expecting him to be bad, after hearing the onset stories and stuff it just seemed like he was trying way too hard. 

Cara Delevigne, I just don't think she's a very good actress to be honest, which isn't that surprising because she's a model turned actress. Also that weird hip dance thing she was doing at the end was just cringey.

I haven't seen any of Jai Courtney's other movies but apparently people hate him, I actually thought he was pretty funny, I thought Captain Boomerang was the role Tom Hardy was supposed to play originally play but it turns out he was originally cast as Rick Flag which is weird because I got a Tom Hardy vibe from Captain Boomerang.

Also worth mentioning, Jared Leto's Joker was something to behold in my opinion.  I felt like Heath Ledger's Joker was much different in that he always sort of had this composure, like he knew exactly the way things were going to play out.

I always laugh at people who say their childhood is ruined by bad movies but now I can kind of see what they mean.

As kind of a side note, I also really liked M. Night Shamalan's Unbreakable, which a lot of people hated.  The few people who I know that liked that movie also like BvS.

I found Suicide Squad to be very entertaining.  However, I can't help but shake the feeling that it was supposed to be of a more darker and serious tone.  Given the tone of MOS and BvS, combined with the types of movies I am used to from David Ayer, I feel like it was artificially lightened, specifically in the choice of soundtrack.  Good songs, but to me they didn't really match what I was seeing on screen.

I thought there was some really good emotional moments that could have played out more, but were squashed.

* I thought critics were unnecessarily savage towards BvS even though it still wasn't amazing. But BvS was much better than Suicide Squad.
* I'll second another poster here who said that whoever is cutting trailers for WB needs a fucking raise. The Suicide Squad trailers had me hyped all year...turns out all the good stuff was in the previews.
* Speaking of editing, it's all over the place in this film. The extended character intros goes on for way too long. The pacing is just off throughout the entire film. It feels like there was a completely different movie buried in here at one point, and then it was chopped up and made all shitty. 
* The best scenes are when the squad members are bantering with each other, but sadly there aren't enough of these scenes.
* Margot Robbie did a good job with the material. And I never thought I'd say this, but Jay Hernandez did too.
* Will Smith never felt like he was comfortable as Deadshot.
* I'm just going to say it- Jared Leto sucked as the Joker. It didn't help that he wasn't in the film very much, but he didn't COMMAND the screen like Heath Ledger or Jack Nicholson did with the character. I was annoyed by his weird purrs and growls too.
* Yet another boring-ass villain plot to open a dimensional rift that will destroy the world. It just seemed so lazy and generic. Plus the Enchantress was fucking weird, and not the good kind of weird.

Overall I'd give it 3/10. I was so excited for this film all summer and I'm so disappointed it turned out to be a turd. I feel bad for DC...they're trying so hard to play catch up with Marvel but their EU is really struggling.

d650jmr,"Cara Delevinge can't act, so having her as one of the villains, as well as Cara being the villain to have most of the dialogue and the other villain just being the muscle / sidekick, was bound to fail.  At one point she is just wiggling around casting a spell or something, idk it was shit.  There was hardly any emotion from her and when there was it felt fake and forced.

Margot Robbie was good as Harley but the accent dropped a few times.  Her back story done in flashbacks was weak, I feel this should have been a Batman / Joker / Harley / Arkham Asylum movie where we could watch Harley's descent into madness. 

Will Smith played Will Smith playing Deadshot better than anyone else who has tried to play Will Smith.

Killer Croc, Captain Boomerang, Katana were all under used but maybe that wasn't a bad thing with Jai Courtney.  As an Aussie myself I felt some of Boomerang's lines could've been done better to bring out the bogan Aussie a bit more and get a better laugh.  Killer Croc was weird looking with a massive head which made his body look small.   And I don't know wtf Katana was supposed to be doing there.

Viola Davis as Amanda Waller was great.  Perfect fit for the role imo.

Slipknot was handled poorly.  Introduced as ""the man who can climb anything"" (wow, lame) then he punches a female guard just to let us know this guy is bad.  Even if you hadn't watched the trailers and speculated about his quick demise, you knew he was gonna go first when everyone else got a flashback intro except him.

And Leto as the Joker was disappointing even though it had this cool little side story of the Joker trying to rescue Harley.  I think the Joker was wasted as a secondary plot device, though secondary might be too generous.

But I thought this was alright entertainment.  It wasn't great, it wasn't horrible, I just felt it was some light entertainment.  I'm not a DC fan so I have no emotional investment in this movie or the DC franchise so maybe thats why I just enjoyed it despite its glaring flaws.",4w86a7

d65tg50,"The best part of the movie was Batfleck, despite the fact that he received very little screen time. 

Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn was decent, though I wish she had better lines to work with. 

Deadshot literally just felt like a recycled Will Smith performance, and the backstory with his daughter seemed kinda forced (and made the movie's tone feel inconsistent). 

Tattooed flame dude also felt like a very cliche character with an overdramatic backstory (2004's Hellboy already did the whole ""I don't wanna hurt people with my flame powers"" thing). 

Boomerang was ok, though I did warm up to his character after a while. 

Killer Croc was extremely underutilized, and was given little to no personality. By comparison, Guardians of the Galaxy's ""brute"" character still possessed some discernible personality.

The Joker seemed a bit....weird? I couldn't really tell what he was going for. Maybe he was trying to come off as more ""street"" or ""gangsta"". I didn't get that ""unsettling"" feeling you normally associate with Joker from Leto's performance. That scene where he's lying down in the room with the knives laid out fell flat and out of character. The Joker is supposed to be an intimidating character because you DON'T know what he's capable of. I think Jared Leto is generally a very good actor, but was given some poor material to work with in this case.

I HATED the soundtrack. Felt like a random youtube playlist an 11 year old boy put together. The music clashed with the tone of a lot of scenes, and ended up reducing their emotional impact.

Most of the movie's dialogue felt very recycled. My favorite stinker was probably: ""How long have your eyes been open?"" ""MY WHOLE LIIIIIFE!""

Also, why are we still doing the whole ""glowing beam shooting up at the sky slowly destroying a city"" climax thing?

It seems that they sped through the last half.

Enchantress having a seizure every other scene.

The love story angles.

Lack of Joker.

d66u3w8,"Have to say this was one of the most infuriating film going experiences I've ever had, because there was a good movie buried underneath a horrific script and messy editing.

I don't want to do a full recap of the entire movie, but here were the aspects I thought were poorly scripted, edited, or just stupid in general:
- The introductions were great, but why introduce Deadshot and HW twice? The pre-logo sequences were incredibly unnecessary. Additionally, Slipknot and Katana weren't even adequately introduced to begin with.
- Similarly, we have the dinner sequence and Pentagon meetings basically repeating the same flaw, when only one was necessary (albeit with the full introductions in either scenario). It's like BvS all over again.
- I'm completely fine with Slipknot being killed quickly. But Katana? She had almost no purpose the entire movie, and her motivation was nonexistent. Was she a good guy from working with the Army? Why was se so quick to join them in the bar then? It's just stupid.
- Speaking of stupid, the entire idea that soldiers shooting these creatures won't kill them, but Deadshot shooting them or the others punching them will is absurd. I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a lot – and DC movies are great at building a world you can believe in, even if they're flawed in so many other ways – but c'mon.
- Also stupid? The entire plot of saving Waller. Her being in that building was stupid. Her killing people who didn't have ""clearance"" was stupid (why the hell have them there?). Deadshot not just shooting her in the head so she can't use the device was stupid.
- Another stupid thing? Waller having no real security for the heart or bottle with Enchantress' brother. 
- Yet another stupid thing? The whole Deadshot-finds-the-secret-file cliché. It added nothing to the storyline. Maybe this was more prominent in one of the two cuts, but it's still a stupid plot device and I have a hard time imagining it working in any cut.
- Joker was criminally underused for being relatively essential to the plot. His scene with Common was perfect. His scene with HQ and the chemical cat was unnecessary. How did that make the cut?
- The tone was off the entire movie. All the jokes fell flat because they didn't fit. Like someone mentioned in another comment, I was waiting for something to happen with Boomerang's unicorn the entire movie. A dream scene at the end of him riding a giant fluffy unicorn would have been absurd and perfect.
- Speaking of the dream scenes at the end, they were all pointless: they came out of nowhere with no justification or feeling they were actually character motivators.
- The entire final fight was sloppy and terrible, too. And another action cliche: A main character grabs a weapon off the ground to win the fight. Groan.

I could go on, but I'm getting mad just thinking about how much better it could have been. I'd be interested in seeing Ayer's original cut, but the intros were the best part of the movie, and if he didn't come up with those, then maybe his cut really was bad. But they clearly needed to pick one cut and stick with it, because this was a jumbled mess that ruined some great performances, great cinematography and great ideas.

I can't recommend anyone seeing it in a theater.

Edit: last one, actually...
- Three helicopter crashes, and only the main characters survive every one? Ugh. The HQ and Joker one was particularly bad.",4w86a7
d67bcf4,"I liked the movie, it has a lot of room for improvement but overall an enjoyable film. I left the cinema satisfied and was excited to see how DC handles their movies in the future. 

I thought the editing was a little off. I'm not an expert so I might just sound pretentious but I felt some of the editing could have been done better. Some parts, for example, the scene where Harley Quinn says ""I'm known to be quite vexing"", I thought that scene would have more emphasis and be funnier, like it was in the trailers. Instead, it was slow and kind of awkward, everyone just standing around. Same with when she broke the window to get a bag. And the action scenes didn't feel like anything different to any other shooting scene from a generic action film starring Mark Wahlberg, it didn't feel tense at all. 

It was a little slowish but there were parts that I enjoyed, like the Joker scenes with Harley, like the scene where he dives after her, that was cool. I wasn't really blown away by anything until I saw El Diablo come out as that fire-skeleton thing, saying ""Let's fight bitch"", which was pretty badass. Deadshot was awesome as hell too, his first scene as a contract killer was amazing. 

Would definitely watch this again, can't wait for the Director's Cut/Ultimate Cut/whatever it's called. ",4w86a7

The movie was not good. Those stories that they brought in the people that edited the trailer to help recut and make a friendlier movie are clearly evident. Seems a lot was left on the cutting room floor and reshoots jacked this movie up. It now plays as one gigantic trailer, music cues with ""cool"" music and all. Plot, script, acting were crummy.

Everything we learned about the characters was straight up described in the beginning to us rather than allowing us to draw our own conclusions of the characters based on their actions and/or dialogues.

The little that we did see of the joker was messy and confusing. I never really understand his purpose in the movie other than to aid Harley Quinn's plot. 

I didn't like Margot Robbie's performance. Yes she's hot and yes she's an awesome actress but her character didn't work from me. Nothing about her seemed legitimately insane or menacing. 

The actual villain of the movie, the enchantress (lame) and the random guy she turns into her brother (wtf) simply weren't menacing or intimidating. They were incredibly bland and it was horribly predictable. ",4w86a7

It dragged on a little to much and if it cut like 20 mins it would be a great film. Action scenes were awesome but the final battle was anticlimactic. Harley Quinn and Deadshot are amazing but Amanda Waller stole the show. The enchantress was cool but I wish she stayed grimy and silent. I didn't like when she cleaned up and her dancing was weird and awkward. If it wasn't for the 2nd half dragging on and being cliche I think people would have enjoyed it a lot more.

It seems like you guys are just *trying* to not enjoy every movie that comes your way now a days. The Joker was pretty well done IMO, his acting was good. Who gives a shit about one tiny tattoo on his forehead that's barely visible?

Harley Quinn was also well acted, and I don't know what people are saying when they complain that these characters are shallow and undeveloped. They really fleshed out some people like Flag, Harley, Deadshot, El Diablo, and Amanda Waller. Of course they definitely skimmed over some others, but I'm not surprised (and therefor not disappointed) because it's not like The Avengers where each and every one of them had their own origin movie(s) before hand. This was a 130 minute movie with a whole plethora of brand new characters. Everyone had their moments. Besides Slipknot.

Also the Batman and Flash cameos were pretty neat, and the whole beginning of the movie (albeit feeling like one giant trailer) was really neat. Anyways, I thought I would just share my positive opinions on this movie in the humongous sea of shit that it's been drowning in.",4w86a7

After knowing them for like 4 hours"" ""oh Deadshot loves his daughter too bad I only saw their relationship for like 1 minute""

I liked all the characters but Harley got on my nerves a couple of times and her accent slipped a couple of time. There wasn't enough of Leto for me to gauge how much I liked it, there were some moments where he really felt like Joker and some not so much.

The action kinda sucked with almost all of it just being slow motion. 

The villain was trash on par with Thor 2 villains.

The whole thing felt extremely half baked, I can't imagine that *this* is the movie they set out to make. It was just expository dialogue which propelled us into countless flashbacks and half baked music videos punctuated by meaningless action. 

I don't get why they didn't just make a film that focused on Harley, Deadshot and Waller with the Joker as the villain, instead of whatever this was. 

It was clear they noticed the good reaction to the music in the trailers and doubled down. In the opening few minutes there are at least a half a dozen songs, it was ridiculous.

d64yxy8,"28% is ridiculous. Yes the movie struggled to find a tone but Davis was amazing as Amanda Waller, that scene where she clears the room after Flagg and Deadshot save her was terrifying and sold me on her character completely. I really hope we see more of her in the DCEU. 

Leto and Robbie were strong as Joker & Harley, definitely thought they had chemistry and all the scenes showing how Harley became Harley were entertaining and shed light on the character and all her motivations.

Will Smith was strong, I totally understood Deadshots motivations and liked that he was the only member of the squad besides Flagg doing it for someone else. The scene at the end where he's teaching his daughter about angles was a nice ending for him in the movie. (I'm sure he's signed on to a multi picture deal) 

Shockingly didn't hate Jai Courtney although I doubt we'll be seeing anymore of Captain Boomerang or any other members of the squad except maybe Flagg.

Now, if they had set up each of these characters before in their own movies, or at least as villains of prior movies, and established them as characters beforehand, they could have cut a lot of that now necessary stuff, and focus on the stuff the audience wanted.

d66h2fg,This movie was just visually dark ,4w86a7
d67eauc,"IN DEPTH THOUGHTS:

First of it’s an ensemble movie but Deadshot, Harley and Rick Flagg are the main focus of the team, which I think is the sensible thing to do with the Squad. The intros to each of the team-members by Waller is a great, comic-y way of introducing the characters to the audience and although one of the criticism is them keep saying they’re “bad guys” without really showing them doing bad things, I feel the intros do a good job, plus the whole bomb in the neck prevents them from doing really bad stuff, which is kind of the point to it.

Deadshot is great, at first I was hesitant of Will Smith but he’s a charismatic, cocky hitman who is sympathetic thanks to the involvement of his daughter. He’s got some real funny lines and Deadshot standing on the car, taking out generic goons is one of the movie’s highlights.

Harley is phenomenal. They show her in the classic red n black suit just long enough to realise they made the right choice in not putting her in it for the whole movie. Her relationship with the Joker is made less abusive which is nice and her vision of a normal Joker is touching.

Speaking of Joker, both him and Batman are used sparingly in the movie and it’s enough; Batman is menacing when he is an antagonist who swoops in and the bat-cuffs and rebreather were super-comic-y. Joker could have been the antagonist of the whole movie but I feel that he’s now in a better position to be a villain in the sequel as now we’ve seen his interactions with Harley and if she has to decide between Joker and the Squad, the decision will have more weight and impact to it. People have said he’s too much of a gangster but he’s been more of a gangster in comics and Hamill’s Joker was very much a gang leader and after all, it’s hard to come up with Joker-y schemes when you have no resources.

Viola Davis rocked it as the Wall, she’s imposing, calm and badass. Rick Flagg is a great second-in-command and his relationship with Enchantress/June Moon is a decent way of keeping him involved and highlights Waller’s use of leverage and manipulation to get what she wants. Enchantress herself is IMO the best villain they could have had. Having her be part of the team initially then turning against them to retrieve her heart is better than introducing another character and finding enough screen-time to be decent; at least Enchantress gives us some emotional conflict with Flagg’s involvement and also her motivation is sound IMO; she’s a ancient goddess who is no longer worshipped and was betrayed by humans when they locked her up in the artefact.

Boomerang is hilarious, he’s definitely the comic-relief of the movie with his pink unicorn, beer and wisecracks. It’s Jai Courtney’s best role to date and watching the movie in Australia means the audience cheers and laughs, especially when he’s robbing a bank to AC/DC. Having the Flash turn up is a great surprise if you didn’t know he was gonna be there and his blue lightning suggests that they probably won’t be doing other speedsters in the movies and Grodd or the Rogues are likely to be the villain(s) in the Flash movie. 

Having read the New 52, comics I felt I saw Diablo’s death coming. I was disappointed they made him accidentally kill his own family instead of the family of other gangsters, but it did make him more sympathetic and the CG alt-mode he has is a nice surprise.

Croc was just the muscle although I’m kind of disappointed they made him stereotypically black and would have preferred his race was left a mystery. His prosthetics are fantastic and probably the best realisation of Croc we’ll see in a live action movie (although a brief appearance of a more monstrous, Arkham-game-like, CG version in a hallucination, dream or vision would be some great fanservice) but I can only imagine how much of a pain in the arse it must have been for Adewale to have applied each morning so no doubts that the shirt and hoodie where used to not only disguise him but also allow the make-up people to just do the face and hands.

I called Slipknot’s involvement in the movie during the first trailer he appeared in, so I’m not annoyed by his very short appearance in the movie as it was a foregone conclusion that he was going to be the example of the neck bombs.

Katana felt kind of shoe-horned in and they probably could have done without her involvement; that said, they gave her the mask and they gave her the soul-stealing sword so although she was unnecessary, she’s the best on-screen Katana (fuck Arrow).

Overall I liked it. It was exactly what I thought a Suicide Squad movie would be like, a series of intros, a mission, some complications and a bad-guy who isn’t great, but the main focus is on the Squad and their interactions. Would go see it again. 
",4w86a7
d67f5ja,"LOL the summary in the OP is for that dumb 9 Lives movie.

The movie was alright.  It was better than Batman vs Superman by miles.  I think they inserted joker a little too much (at times it felt unnecessary).  The action was enjoyable but the last fight with enchantress suffered from that problem when you have one character face off against a group (you know, everybody seems to wait around)... when she pulled out those blades it seemed to slow down the action (I thought they should have continued with the teleportation attacks).  I do think there was some bullshit in how this cast of unredeemable sociopaths (except for Diablo) would look at Waller and Flagg like they were the heartless monsters (though Deadshot admits to only killing men, and they portray him as more of an anti-hero than a hitman).  Harley may be a straight up psychopath, so maybe that's her reasoning for her reaction to Waller and Flagg.  Croc practically bites and eats people, so who the fuck is he to judge? And I kind of thought it was laughable/stupid when Capt. Boomerang's introduction shows him killing his partner only to have Flash show up and quip ""no honor amongst thieves"" only to have Deadshot drop the same line when they bond in the bar.  I suppose that was the joke but maybe it could have been played off better.  Diablo made the most sense as his character had nothing but remorse after killing his wife and kids.  The bomb that killed the enchantresses brother was a bit odd, not the fact it killed him but the fact something that detonated however many stories below only took out a tiny (very specific) corner of the room.

All and all I liked the characters:
I thought some of  Harley's lines fell flat, she redeemed herself in other segments of dialogue amd some acrobatics were awesome (such as her landing after the helicopter carrying the joker was hit).  

Croc was pretty good, some of his lines were bad (like the writer was forcing Croc to have dialogue), kinda wish he was bigger (more like taller and wider), his scene with the seals- I mean some of the Seals looked bigger than him.

I liked Flagg, I can't put my finger on it though...it kind of felt like he fell flat or off, really it was that end where he crushes Enchantresses heart, I just didn't feel that emotionally drawn to it (maybe because they didn't devote much time to establishing their relationship other than reveal they were sleeping with each other (the scene where Moon tells Flagg to take her out does reveal they had some intemacy but as a viewer they could have expounded their relationship of the film.

Enchantress, I liked her but wish they delved more into her relationship with Flagg instead of Joker hunting/trying to break out Harley.  I hate to do a ""they shoulda done"" but they should have just have her brother appear, and have her betray the team later in the film...I think it would have had more impact on her relationship with Flagg and the team (like ""surprise"" he's my brother and I've been plotting against the team!).

Capt Boomerang, was alright, kind of wish he did more with his Boomerangs.  He seemed to be more like comic relief (alongside Harley).

Deadshot was pretty awesome, Will Smith was great but there are times I though maybe he played it with a little too much swagger, but maybe I don't recall too much on his source character.  I think they portrayed him a little too innocently.  I get the ""no women and no kids"" but they portrayed him as killing mob guys (pretty sure he killed whoever he was paid to).  This may not be a big deal but I think it was silly he acted disgusted over Flagg's actions in the bar.  If anything he would have rubbed it in Flagg's face (as he was really no different, just motivated differently).

Katana, holy shit, I would watch a movie just about her.  It's odd to me how they seemed to just throw her in yet make her character have more depths than some of the key members (deadshot and Harley).  The scene where she broke down apologizing to her husbands soul trapped in her sword.  Maybe I'm a sucker for a good ole revenge tale.

Waller was awesome, Viola did a top-notch job portraying her.  I suppose some purists can complain she wasn't built like a wall but I didn't care, she was great and played the part well.  You kind of want to hate her but she has to do what no one wants to.

I liked Leto's Joker, kind of wish he'd dial it back a bit in some (when he snorts as he hovers over the prison guard among other things).  Him rescuing Harley near the climax wasn't needed but I loved his (and Harley's) introduction as well as the end where he shows up to break her out.  I still think the tattoos are kind of dumb.  He does use the smile tattoo on his hand pretty well though, and luckily they glared out or overshadowed his forehead so you don't see the stupid ""damaged"" tattoo on his forehead often.  He had some great moments.

The post credits scene would have been better or made more sense if he didn't already have the fucking files from Luthor in Batman vs Superman but I suppose DC and Warner Bros are trying to put that movie and Snyder behind them now.

Tl;DR: It's a good movie, about as good as you'd expect a superhero movie to be.",4w86a7
d6874lv,"**Quick Review: Satisfactory summer blockbuster.** There are some good moments, some bad moments, but overall I enjoyed the experience. The first half of the movie is a little thrown together with trying to form the team and give backstories in a short time. Once things get going the plot's a little more cohesive(sort of).

 I really wanted a lot more from the characters, Amanda Waller and Deadshot are probably the most interesting people on screen. Harley Q. is underutilized and I'm not real sure why the Joker is even in the movie, his subplot seems really forced. Also, while he looked really different than previous iterations of the joker, his personality and voice were still very reminiscent of the Heath Ledger version. A Harley Quinn prequel movie that explores her relationship with the Joker in greater detail would be nice.

Once again I think the creators are trying to put too much into each DC movie, there's too many characters, too many story arcs they pull from, etc. A less is more approach could really help the directions of their films.

You know it's bad for you but you eat it anyway because it's delicious. That's this movie. 

If you are going to make a bad movie, make it entertaining and that's what this movie was; entertaining. 

With that said, I hope in the sequel they go with a different editor because WOW, that was some incredibly bad editing. Some of the worst I've ever seen in a major movie.

* Viola Davis is a great Waller, she really personified the role.
* Jai actually found a role he's great for and he doesn't have to change his accent! He was pretty funny throughout the film even if I couldn't understand him at times.
* Will Smith was definitely one of the better characters and it didn't feel like he was trying to steal the spotlight.
* The team dynamic worked and they all played well off each other.
* I personally really liked the soundtrack.

**CONS**

* Didn't like the Enchantress tbh and I didn't think she made a good villain.
* The pacing was messy as fuck, Enchantress was an accquantice then suddenly went to big bad in about a minute, there were several times where I was just left confused as to what was going on as some scenes didn't flow or give the audience enough time to justify it.
* Some quips felt really forced and because of that lost their humour.

He didn't seem insane enough. Honestly batman v superman was way better compared to this movie. Hopefully they release an extended version with what ever they cut out, because batman v superman really redeemed itself with its extended cut release.

I'm done with the DC universe. The problem isn't the actors, or the directors, or the look of the films (they look really great). The problem is WB and their fear of producing anything original. 


I actually feel sad thinking about this film. You have Will Smith as Deadshot and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn - 2 great actors who were made for those roles. And you fucked it up completely. 


I don't understand how this film was so bad. I don't understand how anyone (including David Ayer) could watch this film and not think that it is an incomprehensible car crash.

d64u4rn,"I enjoyed it overall.  There are definitely story problems (I liken it to Thor: The Dark World.  I understand what the villain is trying to do, I just have no idea why they want to do it), I also think the movie would have benefited from a few minutes showing the progression of Harley/Joker's relationship, as well as giving the villains more to do.  To me, this is the kind of movie that would have done better w/o ""end of the world"" level stakes.  Give them something smaller to contend with so you can focus on who the characters are.

I really liked Leto's Joker, even though his story line was pretty weak. Robbie was good as HQ.  Waller was AWESOME in this movie and I can't wait to see more of her in the future.  I thought they used Batman just the right amount (although I would have liked to have seen him grab Croc).  It was great to see Flash too.  

Overall, I give it a 6.5-7.  I'm curious to see if they release an extended cut of this later in the year.

d64u7dj,"I really wanted to like this, but I just couldn't. Even with BvS I really enjoyed it despite its flaws because it was entertaining and awesome and cool to see the comics on the big screen. But this didn't even feel *cool* and at some points it was even lame (all of Flag's dialogue during the final battle). 

But in the back of my head I kept comparing it to *Assault on Arkham* and because it was a standalone movie with a different objective it could focus everything on just the singular plotline, but all the writing surely felt like they were just preparing for the next movie in the DCEU just like BvS and proven by the post- credits scene. This makes me even more hopeful, but not optimistic, regarding *Wonder Woman* because they can really hone in on its one character and how she came to be rather than shoehorning a bunch of different plots.

Also side note regarding the joker: it's not that I didn't like it, but it felt weird seeing him as a neurotic mob boss, even though he is, because of it being live-action. Also we already know who the villain will be in Affleck's movie.

An example is near the end, when Enchantress, an EXTREMELY old paranormal force that has been speaking eloquently throughout the whole film suddenly says ""You don't have the balls."" Lines like that just took me out of the moment.

Like when they threw the C4 and Will Smith was taking aim in slow mo for what felt like twenty minutes, or when El Diablo did the old ""nooooo!"" scream as the camera panned out from the top like in X-3 with Wolverine.

d64z75p,"What we have here is a movie that is pretty good not great and certainly not as bad as the critics have made it out to be. I enjoyed Quinn, Deadshot, Boomerang and Joker the most. Granted the joker felt a little off it could just be because we're all spoiled by one of the greatest performances ever that Ledger brought to the table. 
 

 At times it felt disjointed, cheesy, and the character development was a little thin.
 

 Villain(s) where so so I'd put them on the same level as GOTG or Ant Man where they where not great but didn't hinder the film. 

 
Overall It had its moments of awesomeness and greatness that outweighed some of the glaring flubs a lot like other comic book movies that somehow get 80%+ from critics while this one falters at a 28%. I'd give it a 7/10.


Mainly I'm here to say the critics where way to hard on this film when you compare it to Ant Man which has an 81% I find myself scratching my head. It's a fun summer popcorn movie with some character you may not find in Godzilla or Jurassic World (both sitting at a 71%) I cant put my finger on what the hell made the critics hate this one so much.. as of now on RT the fans have it a 97% so is it possible the critics are wrong on this one?",4w86a7

Some things I liked

-Captain Boomerang was underused but very enjoyable

-Will Smith's Deadshot was great at providing a team member to relate too

-soundtrack was great

-showing Harley Quinn's vulnerable side was cool

-nearly all the prison scenes were great

-Diablo was cool and I liked his backstory

-most of the jokes were pretty good

Things I didn't like

-Amanda Waller gunning down her own people was dumb

-enchantress was a very weak villain

-Slipknot existed only to be killed and it's clear from the start

-Margoe Robbie's accent seemed all over the place

-Leto's joker came across as just a gangster trying to be ""crazy""

-action was not well lit or particularly interesting

-Boomerang, Katana and especially Killer Croc felt really under developed

-editing and pacing was off and I could tell there were scenes cut

d653a0e,"I'm inclined to say it was better than BvS, but the margin isn't huge. DC has done an incredibly shitty job at bringing their latest movies to the screen. Since the Dark Knight Trilogy I've enjoyed the rebooted Superman(probably in the minority here), but holy shit these last two.

Joker and Harley appear genuinely mentally ill. To the point of ""these people can't make enough good decisions to actually be criminal masterminds, even their lieutenants would tie them down and start drip-feeding them meds!"" Not the sociopath and ""dark as fuck"" humor funny, not campy clown funny, just. Not. Funny. Jokers laugh - though genuinely disturbing, I'll give Leto that - was used in random points where there was nothing to be sad, mad, angry, or happy about. It's like he just throws a couple of dice and laughs whenever he gets snake eyes.

As apparently is with BvS, the best parts are waiting for an extended release on the cutting room floor. Haven't seen the extended BvS yet, but from some praises from critics I usually jive with, that would seem to be the case. Scenes where the cuts took place are at times so freakishly poorly edited even I noticed it. And I'm usually the guy who googles for continuity errors, because I'm damn near blind to them.

The movie is a mess. Editing, characters, character backgrounds, story, villain, the set... It's all pretty poor. I liked the soundtrack, cliché as it might be. A doze of classic rock and or roll never hurt a movie, and it kind of fits. But holy shit does DC need someone to take over from the studios mangling their movies.",4w86a7

You bite it and while the bun tastes ok the rest is pretty underwhelming. You sip your cold already watered down cola which kinda helps.

Harley was all over the place, Margot Robbie shouldnt have even been in the top 10 casting possibilities for Harley.

d65d4w2,"I liked the movie's style. It was different from Avengers, different from Batman vs Superman, and it holds up pretty well as a indirect sequel to BvS, since basically the whole setup is about who's going in to protect humanity from increasingly stronger threats that the military and government can't even think of matching. And it manages to have a good amount of lighter moments because of the twisted characters. 

I wasn't really that warm on Enchantress up until the end of the movie during her fight, because she seriously kicked their asses all over the place until they managed to get the drop on her. 

I liked the Joker in this one as well. And this movie was actually the first DC story where I actually kind of felt a bit of sympathy for the Joker when it came to him and Harley. They have this genuinely twisted but genuinely there relationship. 

The fights were awesome as well, and Deadshot was probably my favorite character in this movie.

I feel like people on here especially are predetermined to give it a bad rap just because it isn't a perfect epic of a movie with deep themes and intricate explorations of story. The thing is that not every movie is like that.",4w86a7
d65fd00,"My take on Suicide Squad is this: it's like when you first dump a box of puzzle pieces out on a table, and you know that with the pieces given that you can create a picture that is complete a beautiful, but you have to find a way to make those pieces fit in the correct fashion. With the pieces given, and the scenes that were shown, you can tell that there could've been a great and fun comic book film made out of it, but the pieces just weren't put in the correct fashion (in this case, the editing of the film was just so obviously off). It just felt so...rushed. I know WB was so dead set on the release date of August 5th, but why not take the extra time to produce a film that is going to be something that the audience will love and in turn, will eventually come back feed more money into multiple viewings? That's probably my biggest gripe with the DC/WB partnership. WB is so set with their views on how they want their DC movies to be made, and never seem willing to budge on that when it comes to compromising with the directors. I can also tell that so many egos got involved during the production and editing as well. It is clear now from multiple reports that Will Smith wasn't pleased with originally taking a back seat to Leto and Robbie and that played into the reshoots/re-editing of the film, along with WB executives' egos wanting a film that was mirroring the ""fun"" that Marvel films provide. All in all, I remember Suicide Squad as a film that had all the pieces right in front of it to make a great summer blockbuster, but just couldn't put the pieces together correctly and couldn't decide if it wanted to be light-hearted/comical or dark. 5/10.

Edit: I thought Leo's take on the Joke was above-average, yet should've gotten more time to develop into what I know can be another great take on the character, but that goes back to the editing and cutting of his scenes to appease other egos. Robbie was good, but some of her lines felt forced (still thought it was a great introduction to the Harley Quinn character to film though). Smith's portrayal of Deadshot was really good too, but I think that the story focused far too much on him as a major character and it took time away from developing the other characters as well.",4w86a7
d65hqrs,"So I think the best way to summarize this movie was that it was enjoyable and basically delivered on its premise without being too outrageously bad, which is admittedly a step in the right direction for DC.  It's a good popcorn film because I think the actors did a fantastic job with what they were given and the action is mostly passable particularly in the second act of the film.  The rough editing hurts the first act, but otherwise it's a fun romp, and the pacing and writing is all over the place in the third act but it does manage to bring about at least a satisfactory conclusion to the tale.

In the end, the person with the vulnerability to Kryptonite isn't the one grabbing the Kryptonite spear, no one says Martha, and no one with an aversion to killing is snapping necks or branding criminals, so I think we can call this a 'win' for DC.

The film is flawed though, so the critics are definitely in the right to be calling it out.  The editing in the first act is *all* over the place.  The writing is just flat out terrible.  Character motivations are all over the place, the plot makes thematically little sense, structurally little sense, and even the *action* sequences fail to hold up to any real scrutiny most of the time.

A few Spoilery examples.... helicopters keep getting shot out of the sky... by what?  They never once show us.  When did the enchantress take over Anti Aircraft facilities?  Where did her Waller kidnapping soldiers go when the Suicide Squad rallied in the third act?  They all but vanished, and the Squad walked into her 'throne room' for lack of a better term.   Why was Waller in Midway city to begin with?  Why did she stay when Rick Flagg evacuated?  Why was the Squad's mission to evacuate, were they just going to let the Enchantress take over the world originally?  Nuke Midway City?  Why the hell did Captain Boomerang come back, they didn't really show that to be in his character at any point in the movie.  Why was Katana in this movie, at all?  Why do you set the Suicide Squad up against a villain of their own making for their debut movie, doesn't that make their whole existence kind of pointless and Waller pretty incompetent?  And what was up with that mid credits scene, they went from exchanging favors to threatening each other?  ""You're under my protection.  Shut it down.""  Which is it, Bruce?

I liked this movie.  It's a good popcorn movie.  But DC isn't playing at Marvel's level in the realm of making *good* movies yet.",4w86a7

I thought the same thing would happen here, it didn't.  The plot was all over the place, we never have any characters develop or really become their own. The comedy sometimes works well, other times just seems forced. TOO MUCH MUSIC, like almost every scene was a different song and was distracting.

Amanda Waller is not the badass she is in the comics, she has one scene where you fear her like the **villain** she is. The rest of the movie, she comes of as naive, unprepared, and not at all intimidating.  

Joker/Harley Quinn romance was unexpected. Joker overall had too much editing to make him seem crazy, the audience knows what he is...you don't have to spell it out for us.

Only a few hours after being told he has a bomb in his neck and will die if he runs, Slipknot decided to pose his way to the rooftops, promptly dies from bomb in neck.

Loved pretty much everyone on the squad but I thought it was funny how some would get a full blown intro with backstory, and some was like 'Here's Katana, she kill you dead'. Fight scenes were chaotic with so many people to have to follow. Early scenes felt a little stitched together but did what it needed to.

I enjoyed it, but would probably tell people to wait until Redbox or Netflix. I went to see it because I was curious how Joker would turn out (good to meh) and what the Enchantress was about (would totally do it).

BY the end she was literally standing and dancing and saying shit like 'You don't have the balls.' So cringey. Katana was awesome but barely in the movie. Same with Boomerang. Leto was good as joker, no beef with him but I absolutley hated how they dressed him as some fuck boy gangster. The leather jacket, no shirt underneath, tats and chains? Come on. I thought Margot Robbie nailed Quinn, hated her costuming. Also Waller says how these monsters are so tough and impossible to kill, yet Quinn absolutely destroys a bunch in an elevator with a baseball bat. Killer Croc? Yeesh.

The visuals/filmography were shot to be dark/gloomy, but they tried to balance it out with overly vibrant and erratic editing.

The tone was probably too sombre so they tried to compensate with eclectic music.

I'd be interested to see if they release an extended/directors cut, since the theatrical release was cut so feverishly, and it looks like a lot of stuff was left out.

The reviews are semi right. The editing is horrible. You can tell they made last minute edits in the last couple months. You can tell entire scenes are missing. There are certainly some dumb moments and horrible lines.

The problem I think is: they tried to fit too much into one movie and also tried to keep it 2 hours long at the same time. Same thing that killed spiderman 3 and the batman v. Superman movie.

d678mq7,"The reason I liked this movie was because I keep comparing it to Batman Vs. Superman. I know these two films are basically just two separate films, but they are in the same universe so I feel like that justifies it. 

Anyways, compared to BvS this was good. I for the life of me could not find the plot when I was watching Batman Vs Superman. Things transpired, a fight happened. The name Martha got thrown around, superman was sad the whole time. It was overall a horrible experience in my opinion. It was a movie that was supposed to setup another movie, and everyone in the audience knew that. It can in no way stand alone as an okay movie. It intentionally crippled itself to say the next one will be better, and that's not good, a movie should stand on it's own and have it's own story, not be a 2 hour setup. 

Anyways, SS was not like that at all. We had a plot, we had character development, we had an ending, and hell it didn't feel like it was trying to force a sequel at us. What it was trying to do was world build. It created this world around us to supplement BvS and eventually Justice League. And I know what I said, that BvS was horrible for being a setup. The difference here though is that SS CAN stand alone. Everything it did it was totally secondary. 

Best example I can give is like getting a side quest in a game. Do you really need it to understand the context of everything else? Not necessarily. Is it there for fun and make the world feel a bit more alive? Absolutely. It's not needed, but it's cool that it's there. ",4w86a7

d681p6w,"It was okay...

What kept this movie from being horrible for me is the characters, well some of them. I mostly came to watch this because I wanted to see Harley Quinn betrayed on the big screen, and I wasn't disappointed in that department. Will Smith has some funny lines and killed his role. The other characters were alright, but not much to write home about. As many others have mentioned, many of the character were poorly developed and had questionable reasons for being in the movie at all. I just didn't care about them. I also didn't really like the joker tbh, it just didn't feel like joker we all know and love. Plus, his whole role in the movie felt forced and his relationship with Harley wasn't believable for me. 

The actual story was poor, where scenes felt rushed and all over the place. The ending was cheesy and painfully predictable. The villain... oh my, what were they thinking? She started off alright I really like her look in the office scene... but it went downhill from there. The dialog in the movie were cheesy at times that I had to close my eyes, I mean I loved Harley for the most part but some of her lines fell flat. Some scenes it felt unbelievable, like, the whole they're my family now line from diablo was hilariously bad... what? you're willing to sacrifice your life for a bunch of dudes you barely know? Right. Fight scenes were lacklustre and left me bored at times. I guess, I kinda like batman here, although the daughter(of deadshot) was jarring(probably due to bad acting). Liked some the music as well. I might be one the few on here who quite liked the introduction bit. 

Overall, this movie was barely passable. It's a fun ride, but it's filled with too much flaws and poor writing that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they're just interested in seeing some of the characters on the big screen.",4w86a7

d6acbho,"7/10 for me:

For me this movie was far more about the characters and the performances. The story itself was pretty meh!

Will Smith was the stand-out for me, given that there seemed to be some controversy when he was cast. He was funny, played the emotional side well. I hope Smith sticks around for a couple more movies, loved him. 


Margot Robbie was great, just as a lot of people predicted she would be from the trailers.


Jared Leto...of what little we actually got of him was amazing! Really looking forward to seeing more of him, with the amount of hate he got when he got cast. I thought Jared knocked it out of the park.


Jay Hernandez, gonna be honest Diablo didn't have my attention for a while. But now i'm sorry he is dead, I really....warmed, up to his character. 


Jai Courtney, didn't get as much character development as other members of the squad. Hopefully he will get more fleshed out in the second one.


Ben Affleck was great as always, bring on Batman's own film!


Killer Croc was dead-weight imo. Didn't care for him, couldn't even understand him half of the time. Least favourite of the Squad for me. Which is a shame, because I loved Adewale in Lost.


Katana just seemed kinda shoe-horned in, like Killer Croc I didn't care much for her. She does sort of intrigue me though, looking forward to seeing more of her.


Slipknot...HAHAHAHAHAHAHA


And finally Cara as Enchantress/June. I found June boring and Enchantress a bit...weird. Were they going for an Egyptian thing? I don't know, disposable villain though.

I liked the film. 

Good pacing, great action, great jokes and relatively good character depth.
This movie also felt as if something was in fact on the line. Batman V Superman just felt like a private party and had forced consequences. 

The only thing that I disliked about the movie is how it handled the Joker. Definitely the worst joker of all the ones i've seen.

This joker was just your run of the mill psychopath. If you want to see the true joker, I recommend the killing joke. 

Other than that, it's a good movie that you'll enjoy.",4w86a7

First hour and half is the best. This makes me want the batman and Harley animation come even more!! Just want watch it again. Hope there's an extended cut.

d64wqt3,"Just got home from the 6pm IMAX 3D showing. Brace yourself for a long review.

Let me start with a little bit of background from movies. I LOVE the DC comics brand. I know that sounded a little weird, but by that I mean I love the *Batman: Arkham* games, I love the comics, I love the movies (for the most part), I have quite a bit of merchandise in forms of Funko POPs and even full size *Batman v Superman* posters. As for the whole DCEU thing, I actually loved *Man of Steel* upon my first viewing at the 7pm Wal-Mart screening they did. It was one of my favorite movies for a while, but this was due to the hype I experienced. I have watched the film about three times since that theatrical viewing and have learned to discover it had problems, especially with the script, which ranges from laughably bad at times to actually pretty good. Sure, the ideas and themes explored in Man of Steel were fantastic, but the writing definitely hurt it. That being said, I still find it to be kind of fun, and would give it an 8/10. So of course, with my appreciation for *Man of Steel*, I was excited out of my mind for everything to come out of this universe, and I still am. I'm still looking forward to *Wonder Woman, Justice League, The Flash, Aquaman*, you name it. I'm just really excited to see what they can do with these characters, there's just so much potential. I was also, formerly excited for *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* and this film, *Suicide Squad*. I went to the 6pm Thursday show of *BvS*, and was eagerly anticipating it, even with critics dissing it. Unfortunately, to say it hadn't met my expectations, would be an understatement. There will things I really liked about *BvS*, including the score, Wonder Woman, Superman, and the cinematography at times. But my love ends there. I couldn't stand the horrible performance of Lex Luthor by Jesse Eisenberg which felt like a joke. I couldn't stand watching the Justice League being built through an email of all things. I couldn't stand the ending, and the Martha scene is just awful. I gave the film a 5/10, and I haven't viewed it since its theatrical inception. Though one of these days, I do want to watch the Ultimate Cut sometime.

Anyway, so after how bad *Batman v Superman* was, I was hoping that this would be the one to yank the DCEU out of reverse and into overdrive. This is easily my most anticipated movie of the summer, tied with *Civil War*. And then of course, reviews came out, and it was not pretty. As I write, the film is scoring a 27% on Rotten Tomatoes. (I guess that's DC's lucky number.) So of course my hype sort of died down, but I was still excited simply to see some of my favorite comic book characters on the big screen. And who knows? Maybe it would of been a dumb fun movie,.

Unfortunately, this movie was absolute garbage.

Let me start from the beginning of the film. The first 20-30 minutes, weren't bad. Great? Probably not, but it had the stamina of a Marvel film, and even though it was essentially just background for the characters, I can't say I wasn't entertained. It had a few good jokes here and there and it definitely set up what could of been a fun movie. While nobody was really a star so to speak throughout this movie, Margot Robbie, Will Smith, Ben Affleck, Jared Leto, and Jai Courtney were all pretty solid at playing their respective characters. Actually, I'll take that back and say everybody did a decent job, though like I said, nothing extraordinary. As somebody who actually didn't like Ben Affleck in *BvS*, I actually kind of digged him in this film, despite being in it for a few minutes. Jared Leto is the same deal, he's not The Joker from your comics but it does fit the universe very well. If he's going to be in *Justice League* or Ben Affleck's solo Batman film, you can consider me there ready to see it. The soundtrack also wasn't too shabby, but it wasn't great either. You see, the score is a bit better than a Marvel film, but definitely no where near *BvS*. And they also used a lot of 'hip' music so to speak that didn't fit the film but just felt there for the teen demographic. It didn't ruin the movie more than it already was, but excluding it wouldn't of hurt either.

So my praise ends there. I literally can't think of what else I enjoyed about this movie. I guess the basics like visual effects and costume design were really nice, but it's kinda hard to find a superhero hero film nowadays that wouldn't have those items be nice.

I'm not sure to begin, but I guess it would be the pacing. This movie is *waaaaaaaaayyyy* too fast paced. It's one of the fastest paced films I've ever seen. Everything is simply skimed over and no time is ever spent on anything, whether it be character development, plot, action, you name it. They go from one scene to the next so quickly I struggled to understand what was even going on. Which I guess also ties into the editing. The editing for this movie made *Batman v Superman* looks like a cinematic achievement in editing. Every scene, after those first thirty minutes, constantly feels like huge chunks of it were left on the cutting room floor. When your movie is supposed to go from point A to B, it goes from point A to C, completely feeling like it is missing something along the way. And the ending felt more incomplete than not just *Batman v Superman*, but is probably one of the worst I've seen in recent memory.

In addition, about halfway through the movie, the humor gets EXTREMELY stale. The first half, while none of the jokes were burst out funny, had a few chuckles in them. Throughout most of the second half, I was cringing at how awful not just the humor was, but the dialogue. These characters COMPLETELY lose their development and feel nothing like their comic book counter parts. This is definitely one for Harley Quinn. For most of the second half she doesn't act like the crazy cut psycho she was, she just acted like a really watered down superhero and suddenly cared about the rest of the squad. And some of the lines spoken are just some that not even Daniel Day Lewis could pull of saying. At times, it reminded me of *Fant4stic* in how stupid the dialogue was.

Back to characters, Katana and Killer Croc literally have NOTHING to do throughout the entire film. I kept forgetting they were even in the movie until I saw them on screen. Absolutely nothing is memorable from not just them, but any of the characters. Even in times where your characters are supposed to shine, like action sequences, I felt nothing from any of the action. There was no excitement or tension to be had in any of the scenes. They were just shot so average and everything more or less goes the way you expect the scene to go, with no twists and turns to be had. Nothing was ever at stake.

As for the villain, while I thought it was a worthy foe, as I think about this, it had no motivation at all. It just kinda felt like it was there for the plot I guess, but it's not like it gave any of the characters anything to do.

**If you didn't want to read, here's a quick summary.** I love the characters being put on the screen, and it's pretty clear the actors love what they want to do with them. I am a huge Harley Quinn fan, but man, this film dropped the ball. The lines they gave not just her, but most of the cast are just awful, and it might have something to do with the studio reshoots. But I could find nothing to enjoy about this film. The writing, the pacing, the dialogue, the action, the villain, the humor, the editing, were all bland or terrible and brought this film down tremendously. I can't recommend this movie at all to anyone, and it would be hard to do it to a comic book fan. Go read a comic book. Go play some DC related video games. Go buy some of your favorite Suicide Squad character merchandise. You're not going to see these characters here.

**My Rating: 3/10**

So... thanks to T-Mobile, I'll be seeing this again tomorrow.  I'll probably do another review for that to see if my thoughts change. But right now, I'll simply say this film was a massive letdown.

Also, last note, if you are seeing this film, do yourself a favor and see it in 3D. I forgot to mention they did a good job in that department, with quite a bit of depth and some pop outs here and there.",4w86a7
d6541xb,"Just came home after seeing it, it's probably one of the worst comic book movies I've seen.

d65gslb,"Holy bat shit this movie sucks. How can u come in with low expectations? They put so much hype in this movie you had to go in thinking it would be comparable to the avengers. You had the new joker, the long anticipated Harley Quinn, will smith..there was some big money being thrown around in this movie. But DC took a big dump! 

The train wreck consisted of the over use of music, I felt like I was listening to billboard top 10 playlist. And fuck them for using bohemian rhapsody. That song is belongs to Wayne world.

Wtf is up with the cheesy corny one liners? And Diablo turning in to Aztec warrior?!?! Diablo role was a complete mess. Shit I could go on and on.

I do think Wonder Woman is DC breakout movie but we will see..",4w86a7
d66almw,"I really enjoyed the movie. I'm not sure where all of the hate is coming from. People are looking for intense character development and a twisting plot... Too serious. Yes, it's the same cookie cutter plot that every superhero movie uses, but it was fun and it did get touchy feely with some backstory if you need that sort of thing. 

I really enjoyed deadshot. Will Smith knocked it out the park for me. ",4w86a7
d66lfs5,"I really enjoyed myself. 

The villain was weak, as tends to be the case in most CBM's as of late and the final fight didn't live up to the previous scraps (which I quite enjoyed). 

I don't have too many complaints outside of that. I felt the building of the squad was handled well. The use of music seems to be a big divider, but I didn't mind it. I thought the back stories of the main players were handled well given the time constraints.

Margot Robbie and Smith (surprisingly) were the standouts and got the most screen time. Diablo was a surprise and I really enjoyed his character arc.

The scenes with Batman were great and really served to tie the universe together. The small interaction with him and Harley was gold. 

Lots of Easter eggs here too (did anyone catch when it said Harley participated in Robin's murder? Probably my favorite one).

Joker really was a hit for me, but there wasn't enough of him. I dug psychotic gangster joker. The scene with Harley in the chemical plant was deranged and beautiful (the song there really added to the mood too).

Speaking of music, the score was gorgeous when it was given time to shine. DC always nails the original scores for their films.

I'm just rattling off thoughts, but I really liked this movie a lot. The team dynamic, the confined, small mission set up; all of that worked for me. 

I don't blame anyone for not liking it. I do get the complaints (though 27% or whatever it is now seems harsh).

Personally it's about an 8/10. Hoping for a blu that fleshes out the Joker stuff a bit more and adds the material that was rumored to have been cut.

SS: 8/10
MoS: 8.8/10
BvS UE: 9.8/10 (yes...I love that movie)

d6502tp,"Just got home...and I had a ball. So far its the best thing I've seen all summer since CIVIL WAR (I haven't seen BOURNE or STAR TREK yet...so there's that). 

I really liked the third act a lot. The scene in the bar really hit home for me. Here are villains, psychos, sociopaths...having a drink, letting their guard down, and talking like humans. When El Diablo told his story, and wanted pity...Harley just said ""Own that shit"" and she was right. They are bad guys. They have to own that. But it doesn't mean they aren't human. 

To me the story boiled down to love. I mean, it was as much a love story as DEADPOOL was. But here you had Floyd & his Daughter. Flagg and Bloom. Joker & Harley. Hell, even Boomerang was trying to charm Katana....

Ayer really did what he could to round out these characters...and while I Feel that the suits at WB had too much of a hand in the overall edit...his work still shined through.

There were editing issues, and too many close ups. But overall I loved the shit out of it.",4w86a7

Leto had.. a lot to live up to in Joker. And he kinda took a 180 in this. I liked that he didn't have any grandmaster anarchist plans and was fixated on saving Harley. Their chemistry together was pretty bananas and Robbie did Harley perfectly.

Will Smith as deadshot was great.

Jai as Boomerang was awesome. Wished they'd done more with him

d64y5hg,"This movie is not 28 percent on RT bad. It was very entertaining and hell better than BvS

Good things:
Boomerang I could tell from the Bohemian Rhapsody trailer that He was gonna be my favorite character. He's all the comedy needed with the little Will Smith-isms sprinkled in

Will Smith and Margot Robbey nailed their characters. I was skeptical on her until the scene where they were in the Airplane and she started acting like Harley from then on instead of ""lol I'm so crazy and sexy guyZ""

Diablos backstory. I seriously got choked up it was a good depiction of how someone with powers and a short temper would be a Suicidal pacifistic person 

The fucking soundtrack is kickass. Might even give Awesome Mix 2 a run for its money.

Bad things/Meh things:
Not enough of the joker to tell how bad he is. Like he was barely in the film other than to set up that Harley is crazy for him. Maybe should not of included him. Save him for solo batman movie but at the same time you need him to explain Harley it's a catch 22 of movies

Amanda Waller. Every fucking character just says she's a bad ass without ever really doing anything to make her badass. She has the feel to her when I seen Viola Davis on screen I know she could be a great Waller but it seemed the director and the writers were just trying to convince people that she's a bad ass without really knowing how to show it. Like trying to convince a friend that you have a cool movie but you don't want to give away anything about them and just say trust me dude she's bad ass. It goes with one of cinemas greatest sins show don't tell. Make the audience believe she's a badass by showing actions. 

The movie just felt too short even for 2 and a half hours I was left wanting more but not like I wanted a sequel like was that it? Like there could be more to this but it doesn't feel completely fleshed out. If this got an Ultimate Edition with an extra hour of footage or even thirty minutes I'd probably get it on DVD

The character interactions were great and basically pulled from the comics. The action as cool, I enjoyed the fight scenes. Most of the jokes landed for me. It was by no means a masterpiece, but it was a fun summer action movie, which I like, with DC characters in it, which I like. Leto's Joker was good, could have done with a little more of him like we saw in the trailer to justify him actually being in the movie, but if he makes it into the Batman solo film that'd be just fine with me. Villain was a bit of a weird choice. All in all I'd say it was good, not great, but I didn't have the vitriolic ""worst movie ever I hate it"" response that some people are having. I'd give it a B.

- I thought it was an ok amount of funny. ""ooh I love your perfume, what is that, the stench of death?"" was my favourite.

- I really liked Leto's Joker. Slight less anarchic and more sadistic and evil than Ledger's. I didn't think anyone would equal Ledger's Joker but I thought this was a REALLY interesting twist on the character.

I saw Ghostbusters when it came out. This was SO MUCH better than that film. That Suicide Squad sits at 26% on Rotten Tomatoes and Ghostbusters sits at 73%..!? I don't honestly believe that critics are biased but good god I'd totally flip those scores around myself.",4w86a7
d65585w,"I actually really enjoyed it. Maybe it's because it's 100x better than Batman V Superman, which I just recently saw, but I thought this movie was entertaining. I feel like Will Smith and Margot Robbie hold it all together really well even though they're surrounded by weaker characters/actors. I think Harley Quinn needs to be in more DC movies now, I really loved her. I also enjoyed the Joker even though it was a little different and a small part.

The pacing and tone is strange sure, but the content overall was entertaining in my opinion.",4w86a7
d668l7r,"I walked out after an hour or so. This movie is a train wreck. 

Rumor has it that a company that makes trailers, edited the final cut and I totally buy it. It has no direction. The big bad was super phoned in and clearly only designed to allow the main characters to exist. 

The Joker is also awful. Like, seriously. I DO appreciate that they wanted to edge out their own thing, but it felt super artificial, like it was only designed for the Hot Topic crowd. Harley fares just slightly better. 

That Mexican fire guy? Those effects are laughably bad.

The script? Also terrible. Dialogue is straight up cringe inducing. Pacing is awkward and makes ultimately for a boring time. 

And that's the film's biggest crime. I expected it to be dumb, but I expected it to be fun. It's not even that. Its so bad it makes BvS seem... Just bad, not terrible. ",4w86a7

In fact, one thing I think DC does better than Marvel is their movies look so nice visually.  I really love the look.  I would recommend the movie. ",4w86a7

Its entertaining as hell man!",4w86a7
d65lkwr,"Just saw the movie.

I enjoyed it. I liked the first 20-30minutes, I liked Diablo ALOT, Will Smith did amazing, Robbie did amazing.

FUCKING JAI DID amazing. He really humanized Captain Boomarang. 
But 100% Diablo takes it all, his character development, his last fight scene was sick. I do not know much about Diablo, but man what a good surprise. 

The Joker was hit/miss on the little scenes we had of him. I really like when he was talking to the Chief of Security. That was a good scene from the Joker. Also, when he was spraying his AK+Laughing. That 100% reminded me of the Joker, but some parts were a little ummm to much? To much pyscho.

I loved Enchantress to the point that I can look past her Tension Boogie Woogie dancing. When she was inside the mirror, and slammed that guys head in. I thought it was cool. When she transformed at the end to pure black. That was a badass moment.

The best scene I must say, was the Bar scene. 

Harley was 10/10. She called everyone a pussy, just like Harley would.

I didn't see pacing issues tbh. A lot of shitty cuts, but I know WB edited out a lot of stuff. 

The fight scenes were ok. I really liked Enchantress's brother, when they first show him in his like Bio Suit?. But you can clearly tell they were not hitting shit/swinging at the air.

If this movie was rated R, the fight scenes would have felt a lot more realistic.

Oh I can't forget the OG Amanda. She did great. I didn't like how she came at the end all nice, and clean. Like lady, did you take a shower+changed clothes or what?

TL;DR:

Will Smith did amazing.

Harley was amazing.

Diablo was surprisingly good.

Jai didn't suck, he humanized Captain Boom.

Killer Croc had some nice one liners.

Enchantress was badass in her dark form, the god mode is....questionable.

Joker hit/miss at certain scenes. 

Shitty cuts/transition, but not as bad as BvS imo.

You can clearly tell how fake the fighting was between humans. 

Movie should have been rated R.

I give this movie a 7.8/10. I would watch again, and I am 100% sure the Blueray version is going to be better.

edit: I forgot to say, that Shaky cam bullshit when they first started fighting those like zombie people. Was terrible, It was really hard to follow wtf was going on.",4w86a7
d64yli3,"I actually thought it objectively sucked. Plot was hella weak, and the cast didn't get enough individual screen time. That's just me maintaining a critical standpoint instead of being a sheep that immediately judges something as good because I personally enjoyed it. Which I did. I enjoyed the shit out of this movie, but I fight that bias. I'm a sucker for Quinn. I've been blasting the released album tracks for over a month too. So all in all, this was money well spent and this is a rare movie I'll watch multiple times. My actual score is a 6/10, but my personal score is a good 7/10. 

Even the post credits scene seemed kinda tagged on just for the hell of it. Should've been something about Joker. I know it's a shared universe, but this film is incredibly standalone aside from the batman cameos and the superman references, and the brief appearance of The Flash, which-- WTF? Anyone got an explanation for that? Anyway, the post credits scene advances the overall plot of the films, but practically has nothing to do with the rest of the film. Even having Waller just glance at the data, and then mention Bruce, could've set up something for the beginning of the next film, but instead, it was like a post credits scene from BvS. ",4w86a7

Will Smith as Floyd Lawton / Deadshot
The only character that was developed enough and interesting enough, but still didn't make sense at parts.

Jared Leto as Joker
That was a wasted character. I didn't understand any of his motivations, or what type of character he was. I feel like there was more to him, but the end result was just his pointless screen time.

Margot Robbie as Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn
I want to like her, but I didn't really like her. She has some moments, but she DOES NOT steal the show as the ads want you to believe. Also, in a gun fight she brought a baseball bat. Just dumb.

Kevin Spacy as A Talking Cat?!
It might be better than this movie.

Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag
Another absolutely soulless character, I didn't care once for what happened to him.

Viola Davis as Amanda Waller
This was the worst character in the movie. No allegiance, no motivation. Randomly kills FBI agents? Then takes out her phone again at the end of the movie? WHAT?! The whole theater was just laughing at that moment.

Jai Courtney as Digger Harkness / Boomerang
He might be the only one who is true to some kind of consistent character, but why would a team of super people add a thief?? Also, boomerangs are a stupid weapon.

Jay Hernandez as Chato Santana / El Diablo
This guy was very interesting, but the stereotype cholo situation didn't sit well with me.

Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Waylon Jones / Killer Croc
Interesting character, totally underdeveloped, and almost like comedic relief for some reason...

Cara Delevingne as June Moone / Enchantress
Ugh. Just ugh. The actor wasn't very good, and her character was at first mysterious, but ultimately just crappy. Why did any of the bad guys do any of the bad stuff anyways? No motivation at all.

Karen Fukuhara as Tatsu Yamashiro / Katana
This character seemed just shoehorned into the movie for no reason at all, besides a requirement of having a character from a different country. I am surprised they didn't add a kung fu master from China as well.

Adam Beach plays Christopher Weiss / Slipknot
My girlfriends perfect response: ""who?"" I don't even remember seeing him. Once again, atrocious editing and story.

Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne / Batman
Interesting that he had a role in this movie, but ultimately could have easily done without him... Also, where was he when all this shit was going down?

Ezra Miller as Barry Allen / The Flash
Once again, interesting that they added him, but should have just avoided him. Same as above, where was he when bad guys arrived?

Jim Parrack as Jonny Frost
Who?

Common as Monster T
Who?

Shailyn Pierre-Dixon as Zoe

It's a good film would love to see more and with more development. Amanda was a great villain for the villains. Harley was great. Joker was good mafia gangster boss type, laughing as he messes with you. Will Smith doing his standard father figure role with his humour. Croc and Katana could of done with more time but it is a crowded cast films. Nice to hear lot of the tracks which was squeezed in but did improve it, always fun to hear action bronson track. 

Make up was great, really thought Tom Hardy was still in it but it wasn't him:s

d67aqde,"I feel like they shouldnt have had a save the world scenario. Simple and ""small"" plot would have worked best. It should have been tongue in cheek and self aware like deadpool. Scrap the whole enchantress plot. 

My pitch is this: movie cold opens with joker being taken in by batman. A few quick scenes establish passage of time and manipulation of quinn. You see all her backstory right then,  the breakout, acid dive, robbing people with J, and a bigger point is made of how J abandons her to be captured and doesnt give a shit. Title screen. Cut to dinner scene with stranger times cop: amanda walher is on to wayne and wants to rob/infiltrate wayne industries. It makes sense to use criminals so they can be scapegoats if caught. Boomerrang is a master thief and harley knows gothams underworld, so they make sense in the group. Joker hears word of the heist and decides to break in also and beat them to it. While they are in the building, its treated like dredd: they just need to get to the top floor. Squad is pursued discretely by batman and watched, and its filmed like the beginning of predator before he kills, lots of shadow scares and ""huh, nothing there"" lines. Once they realize its him, The squad sends croc outside to make a scene and distract bats. It works. Que epic fight scene between them that isnt shown directly but seen in the backgrounds of the next few scenes through windows and shit. While bats is gone, the scene from the trailers happens where you hear the distant laugh and harley goes ""uh oh"". She hates J for leaving her now and his appearance is treated as a gamechanger. The whole color pallet of the film changes. All the sudden there are henchmen of his on floors and they are setting up crazy funhouse type shit like he always does. Purple and green smoke and neon everywhere. The squad makes their way to the top floor after a couple cool fight scenes in ""theme"" rooms like one with crazy mirrors and music. Jokers voice on PA occasionally. They make their way to the top floor and find out joker has found access to some weapon thats gonna blow up a building or some shit. Not gonna destroy the world or even the city, just some medium sized threat for once in a superhero movie. As they work to take him down, he manipulates harley into joining back with him, just because he needs her to win. Its shown to be the fucked up, abusive relationship it is, not some weird romantic story like ayer made it. With her help, joker and his goons look like they are gonna succeed when batman swoops in at the last second and viciously beats the fuck out of everyone in the room. ""Good"" and bad guys alike. He takes down joker and stops the bomb. Batman saves the day again, and the bad guys are all still just the bad guys. Harley immediately starts blabbing about waller. They are shown locked up in arkham as the camera pans past each max security cell. It slows down at one window and slowly reveals a cell with a hole cut in the wall behind poster ala shawshank and ""ha ha ha"" spray painted. Movie ends. credit scene is wayne using his knowledge of wallers squad as  leverage to get her support for the Justice League Initiate.

The CGI is bad, the character motivations are unclear, the soundtrack distracts from the scene instead of complements it. The villains are woefully under-developed and the scene editing is just ...... what the hell was that!?  

I really cannot recommend other people to watch this in the theater.  Maybe if i wasn't in a forgiving mood because of my fandom to Big Willie and Margot Robbie who delivered slightly above average performances (also Jay Hernandez and *gasp* Jai Courtney!) i'd hate this movie too.

He is told by the store owner he must reconcile with his family within one week, or be stuck as a cat forever. If that's not enough he's also determined only a secretly convened group of disparate, despicable individuals with next to nothing to lose are humanity's only hope against an unstoppable threat.

What the fuck does all that have to do with Suicide Squad...

On to Suicide Squad. . Nothing worked in this movie. The entire squad was pointless, and all sucked anyway. They didn't do anything that a squad of Special Forces could not have done. Literally all the action (well the entire movie)is just people aimlessly shooting at shit, constantly....  They must have shot 100,000 rounds in this movie. It was just one big shoot out after another and everyone was just shooting blanks. I fell asleep in the second big shoot out.  

Harley Quinn was sort of amusing for a little while then just got annoying... The rest of the team was just an excuse to show case some half-assed power that really had no purpose on the scope of the movie then to have a power expose scene.

I wasn't particularly happy about Smith as Deadshot but I changed my mind by the end. Loved Leto's Joker, for what little we saw of it

I also can't help but think that Batman & The Flash would've tried to do something about the world-ending event that was taking place at the end.

It does a really great job of portraying the DC comic book world. Like the scene where Batman and Deadshot are about to face off felt like something out of a comic book. The way that Enchantress was portrayed (except when her brother gives her Powers she looks bad, but they redeemed themselves in the final act when she got back to normal) was really interesting.

But I think the movies fall apart because they fail to make you care about the characters and what's going on in the story. And while this isn't always the case with every movie in the super hero genre, the villain is always kind of meh.

I just knew Slipknot was the example character.

So many scenes just didn't make sense because they had to look cool. Specially that Joker knife circle scene that came out of nowhere.

The Joker...oh man. Some of his suits were on point. His voice was on point. His henchmen and how he went about with them was point. His character, motivations? And his MTV gangsta rap persona I did not like at all. Is this really the Joker that ruined this Batman's life? For real? In a universe that made the scales ""grander"" this feels like some stupid pos tug.

Even Batman's cameo looked and felt cheesy in the 3 scenes.

The best thing I liked was El Diablo. I guess he is the one character Ayer knows how to write.

Will Smith did good nut was flawed. He was another kinda Ayer like character but his one scene to shine was botched. I am talking about that shooting scene on top of the car. It was just meh.

Also what happened to Common? I thought he would be the brother/bad guy instead he is killed in 5 seconds and random guy #4 is made the villain.  I though Enchantress was really interesting but when she turned forms she sucked.

Flag was cool but also not used a lot.

Plot made kinda no sense. So there is an event as big as the Zodd thing. But Batman says nothing about the distruction. None of the others show up to help. And these team made to look like GotG posers stumbles in to a victory. Man...

Harley Quinn is the best part. Deadshot is boring. Killer Croc is fucking racist as fuck.

The casting, I thought all actors in the main roles were good despite the pisspoor script especially Will Smith, Margot Robbie (she really nailed it) and Jared Leto (I really like he made this iteration of the Joker his own compared to Ledger and Nicholson, especially as a deranged criminal)  
  
The first 30 mins like most of said in terms of the team set-up  
  
The team dynamic in the film and also making Deadshot and Harley Quinn sympathetic enough to root for while reminding us they are dangerous killers
  
What I didn't like:  
The script and it's structure- The script falls off a cliff after the team assembles. The biggest mistake is they made the villain a Supernatural one, they should of went with a more Supercriminal/Megalomaniac villain to justify why this was needed.  
  
David Ayer: He was really out of his depth with this one and the thing is there is a better movie that could have been made with his sensibilities as a filmmaker (you saw bits and pieces in terms of Deadshot/Harley/Joker/Diablo) whether that was his choice or the studio's insistence, we won't know.

Also, I wasn't fan of the over-sexualised Harley, but that Jester costume easter egg was pretty nice to see. I wasn't that interested about this version of Joker, he didn't seem to capture that special Joker craziness. ",4w86a7
d67846b,"It was a decent comic book movie. Margot Robbie killed it as Harley Quinn but Jay Hernandez should get some recognition I thought he   was pretty great as El Diablo.

Also Joker is barely in this movie. Don't get hyped for him.",4w86a7
d67s3h4,For me the movie was just decent if I'm comparing it with other superhero movies. The major issue in this movie is that individually the characters are good but there is no 'team' here,4w86a7
d67sdbm,"I think the best characters were the ones with little character

Katana Boomerang, Slipknot, Croc, because they weren't ruined

everyone else's development felt inconsistent or as if it was supposed to be there but we aren't shown it

waller was was a little off but not really bad

some of these ***actors*** had great scenes, but as for *characters*, they felt out of place

",4w86a7
d67tc1o,It's boring and given the cast and characters it should be anything but. There was no peril and Enchantress and her brother were pretty half baked.,4w86a7
d68arzn,"Saw it last night. Really not great. There were some good points - design of Enchantress when she's all dark and creepy, will smith is always likeable, harley quinn was good - but mostly it was horribly edited and came off like it was written by a 12-year-old. Some of the lines were cringe-inducingly bad (Diablo talking about his new family? Really? The group dynamic wasn't even halfway to that point) and the villain was boring and pointless. I just felt really bored throughout the whole thing and had no desire for any of the characters to succeed. Also the music was jarring and out of place. I'm really disappointed, I thought it was going to be a lot better.",4w86a7
d68bhpo,"I think they should have acted more evil. I think they should have made more of a deal about The Joker treating Harley like his property and wanting her back. He doesn't love her that much and I understand the need to have him in the movie. Croc was underwhelming. 

He almost didn't need to be in the movie. The only one I felt was evil was Boomerang. Deadshot never felt evil to me and I think having his daughter talk about killing people upset me a little. 

I liked Jared Leto but I felt like he needed to be smarter. He definitely showed that he had firepower but The Joker is scary because of his intellect and ability to pull off ridiculous things for a fucking joke. I was afraid of him but I hope they put more time into him in the next few films. 

They threw away El Diablo right after showing his amazing super powers. I really hoped that they wouldn't but they did. I hated how they tried to destroy people's characters before killing them off so we wouldn't feel bad. If they just ruthlessly killed Slipknot because he tried to get away I would have gotten hype.

I truly don't see what people see in Ben Affleck. 

edit- Harley needed a more New Jersey accent at that",4w86a7
d68bwae,"You can tell there's a good movie underneath all the really weird edits. I enjoyed it, but I can also recognize that it was seriously lackluster for a movie that should have easily been a home run in the hands of a production team who knew what they were doing. None of the actors did anything wrong, and I don't think Jared Leto's Joker is as bad as everyone claims it is, I just think the way the movie was edited really damaged both the plot and character development of certain characters. 

Other odd moments that stuck out through the first viewing were Cara Delevingne's weird dance moves and slipknot really being more of a cameo than an actual role in the film. It does seem like someone really fucked with this movie in post though. There's no other way to explain all the totally bizarre and rule violating edits. It's like some executive just got all coked up and said, ""meh, fucking good enough, brah"". ",4w86a7
d68ficw,"I was disappointed by it. It just felt really long and boring in the middle and I was shocked it was only two hours afterwards. Plus all the best parts were in the one trailer I saw, as everything else was much worse.

Oh and I disliked the Joker. A lot.",4w86a7

d64xwl5,"I went in with low expectations, but nothing could prepare me for that. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.",4w86a7
d6521bb,"My opinion, its DC's Guardians of the Galaxy, but more street. ",4w86a7
d65g44g,"I liked it a lot. I saw it with my girlfriend last night and we both loved it. There were a few somewhat shitty parts, namely when Enchantress asked the remaining Squad to join her and Harley said something along the lines of ""I'm not much of a joiner, but...maybe we should."" I just thought that was a poorly written line. Also, almost immediately after that, when Harley threw Deadshot the pistol so he could destroy the machine thing, it did one full rotation in the air, and then glided perfectly into his hand. Like I thought I could see the wire, it was so badly done. Croc had his like three lines; one of them was sort of funny, the rest weren't. I don't know why they had him speak at all, if those were his lines. There was a bad cut, as well, when Joker was meeting with Common at the strip club, and had Harley on his lap. She got up to go walk to a different couch and sit down, but they didn't actually show her sitting down. It cut from her standing upright immediately to her sitting down. I get they don't have to show everything, but she was in the frame the entire time, it was a little disconcerting. 

However, I enjoyed it a lot. It was fun. The cast was great, their dynamic was awesome, you could really feel the chemistry between them. I didn't like Waller, but you're not really supposed to. Loved the Flash cameo, I lost my shit for that, and the Batman scenes were great. I do wish the Joker was in the movie more, and I seem to remember a scene in the trailer where a part of his face is burned or something, so I assumed that was meant to be after the helicopter crashed (which is another gripe I have with that movie, every single helicopter you see go into the city gets shot down. Stop getting into helicopters!), but I guess they decided to cut it out of the release. Seeing everyone's vision of what they wanted from Enchantress was cool, just to see a normal Harley and Joker with two kids. I also loved the fact that they showed Harley's original costume, and that iconic cover shot with her in her harlequin gear and him in his tux was really cool. A lot of fan service. I knew Slipknot was gonna die, but I was shocked when Diablo did too. I liked him. I kinda wish there were more Justice League cameos (I loved the Flash, but we saw him cameo in BvS. Give me some Cyborg or Aquaman!).

Overall, I'd give Suicide Squad an 8.6/10. Great, but not awesome. I'd put it right in between Batman v Superman (which I absolutely loved) and Deadpool (which was funny, but not great). I'm going to see it again on Tuesday, so I might update this afterwards.

Edit: Redundancy",4w86a7
d65q1t1,"I haven't seen anyone else discuss this, so maybe I'm just being hyper-critical, but: Margot Robbie's accent. *So* bad. I love you, dear, and you put in a good performance, but your accent slipped every other line.",4w86a7
d66eja2,"Just saw Suicide Squad and went to check the rating on RT, it's at 26%. I get that people don't like this movie, but that's lower than BvS. Seriously I can't comprehend why people would hate this movie so much, it's not DC's GotG, but it's certainly not horrible.  The performances by the cast were great and aside from some story and editing issues I really enjoyed this movie. 

I'd give this movie around a 6 or a 7 out of 10, it's not perfect, but it's what I expected which is a fun, action heavy movie that's easy to watch.
Don't get the hate at all.",4w86a7
d66lhmf,"I LIKED this movie overall.  I can see how some people would find fault with it, but I think the criticism is FAR too harsh against it.

For starters"" 

* This movie had a MAJOR problem trying to find its identity.  It couldn't decide if it wanted to be Watchmen or Deadpool-it tried to be both, and I think those are two styles that I just don't think just don't mix well.  I wish it had embraced the Watchmen side-darker, with a twisted sense of humor.  Honestly, and I'll just say it-I wish Snyder had directed this instead of BvS.  SS had some really serious and dark moments that had me sitting there thinking ""holy moly, I didn't think this movie could go that direction,"" but then they'd bust out in some hip hop song and it just took me out of the moment.  I didn't feel like that fit the tone of the movie AT ALL-I think Bohemian Rhapsody did.  

* Contrary to what a lot of people thought, I LOVED Leto's Joker.  To compare it to Ledger...Ledger's seemed like he had been physically and emotionally abused as a child-beaten, cigarette burns, starved, etc.  He just wanted chaos  Leto's, on the other hand, seemed like he had been sexually abused as a child, and had grown up with some pretty effed up problems.  Leto's just had this psychotic godfather feel to him.  He was truly a maniac who suffered from deep psychosis.  I really felt like it was a unique and fresh take on a character who has been portrayed very well before.  

* The villain(s) just seemed-rushed and awkward to me.  There just wasn't enough interesting set up (especially...where on earth did her brother's essence come from?).  Why did the enchantress ask Waller to tell her how to destroy the armies?  I mean, she has her brother who has been knocking helicopters out of the sky like they're gnats, and she's clearly building a super weapon and army that will be able to obliterate mankind, so it just seemed like they weren't quite sure what exactly she was supposed to be like.

I also didn't like the fact that when she was creating the weapon, she was in the humanoid form instead of the enchantress form-she looked too CGI and unrealistic that way.  It was just awkward.

* I REALLY liked the chemistry between the squad members.  I felt like for the most part, they were all pretty good, especially Smith, Robbie, and Hernandez.  Those 3 killed it.  The rest of the team was pretty good, but sort of felt unnecessary/forgettable.  Croc was clearly the comic relief, and only got his ""big moment"" near the end.  Courtney's character was more like a drunk Scot than an irritated Aussie-he didn't really feel needed at all.  

Over all, I liked this movie.  It wasn't a masterpiece, and there were certainly some flaws (tone/identity, pacing/editing), but I think the low critical scores seem like they're more based off of disappointed expectations instead of the merit of the movie.

I'd easily put it in the mid/upper 70s, which still isn't majorly flattering, but is still more credit than the critics were willing to give it.",4w86a7
d66qaf0,"This movie _is not that bad_.  I can't understand all the hate it gets in the other threads.

What movies do you people like?  Did you expect this to be an oscar winner?  From the trailer this is what I expected to get.  It's a goddamn comic book movie.",4w86a7
d67l26b,The best part of the movie was the Dunkirk trailer ,4w86a7
d68mb7t,"It wasnt nearly as bad as reviews made it out to be. I enjoyed it.

Viola Davis was the highlight of the movie. She is, imo, the definitive Amanda Waller. That was a bad ass, BOSS of a woman. A FUCKING BOSS.

Margot Robbie was great as Harley.  The dynamic between her and The Joker was different in a good way. Harley never felt like the abused subordinate that she is typically portray as. They were equals, and equally crazy. A psycho power couple.

Jared Leto's Joker was really good, he was just not that focal point of the movie, just a wild card popping up here and there.  And in that role, Leto knocked it out, imo. His screen time was very small, but I was incredibly entertained every time he popped up.

Will Smith was Will Smith. I mean, he was good, but he was just playing himself for the most part. It did work though.

Also, that mid-credits scene was almost worth the price of admission.

d653kmg,I really really hated this movie.  It's easily my least favorite movie of the year.  It's awful. I genuinely don't know how anyone who is a fan of these characters could enjoy it.  Pure garbage.  ,4w86a7
d65qodi,"I don't fully understand the overwhelmingly negative thoughts everyone has on this film. I get that there are issues with it, but it was definitely entertaining. Not at any point was I, or anyone else in that theatre last night bored. People were applauding and cheering throughout most of the film. Sure it could have been better, but the characters, the action (minus the CGI), and the comedy was fun. Just don't go into this movie thinking it's going to be the best CBM of all time and you'll have a good time.",4w86a7
d661h17,"jesus christ this movie was awful, DC cannot compete with marvel in terms of quality.",4w86a7
d662qns,"Reviews were wrong. This movie was a lot of fun. Loved Margot Robbie and Will Smith. Jared Leto did a fine job as The Joker. Plot was... lacking, but the characters were entertaining and funny. Was it Deadpool? Absolutely not, but after BvS, this was refreshing. I hope to see more of the three actors I mentioned in the DC Universe going forward. And the after credits scene was worth staying for. Give this movie a shot if you haven't.",4w86a7
d64yaee,"Went into it with low hopes, but I really think Kevin Spacey killed it as Tom/Cat. You can tell he really researched the role and brought his A-game. The owner of the pet shop was easily the funniest guy in the movie. My favorite line was the joke about doing lines of cat nip and the whole trip afterwards.

Unfortunately the whole thing feels like a twist on Lindsay Lohan's Freaky Friday. And some scenes make it blatantly obvious the cat was CG. Once you get passed that it's still a fun movie though. 

Overall: 7/10. 

8/10 with rice.",4w86a7
d65134w,"I just walked out and I loved it. An amazing adaptation of what it is supposed to be, ""The suicide squad"" seriously it was true to the source, the characters are likable and the story was fun. A solid 8. I really liked it",4w86a7
d68hbhu,"I liked it. Came for an action movie and I got an action movie. 

I have noticed for the past few years that critics pan a movie I will like it. Guess DC isn't as good as Disney at paying kickbacks to critics.",4w86a7
d65o00b,"I'm really a little confused at the overwhelmingly negative response to this movie. 

First, I completely acknowledge that there are problems. Yes, there are serious gaps in character logic and characterization. The one that annoys me the most honestly is Amanda Waller killing her own people. While I normally love movies with dark elements, that scene made no logical sense and was only there to show that Waller was cold. Joker sucked. His lines were so bland and undistinct that it was kind of annoying to see Leto oversell them just because he's playing The Joker. The music montage was silly. Harley Quinn does not get to frown on killing women and children. Her lines suck. The team is not Diablo's family, and he should go be in James Bond movies so he can make all the dancing fire girls he wants. Will Smith played Will Smith, and Super Saiyan Diablo was dumb.

All of this being said, I for one was able to shrug through most of these weaknesses because the movie had a competent and structured flow to it. There was X scene where it needed to be, and Y where it needed to be. Even if X and Y weren't necessarily well executed, they were there. This wasn't Transformers with 30 mins of boring prologue and never-ending Michael Bay dick jokes. Or Sucker Punch's nonsensical creative vision. Or BVS' complete emotional detachment.   

All's I'm saying is that I'm surprised at how poorly this movie has been received, when you consider that it has all the beats you would expect of a movie like this. ",4w86a7
d64tk8h,"Saw it at a pre screening last night. it was meh like ok-/10.



It made me dislike Margot Robbie which I'll never forgive but that was the big problem for me. I either disliked or didnt care at all for any of the squad. The movie felt so muddled with too many people. I don't know what the point of having boomerang or the joker or Croc was because they were all useless outside of maybe 2 scenes each.



The pacing was bad to the point i was confused at what all was going on and yet still bored.



Will Smith was literally just the dude from pursuit of happiness with a gun and it's boring imo. We get it you love your kids you tell us in every movie your in.


the sound track was basically ""Now Thats What I Call Music: Arkhams greatest hits"" and nonw of it really fit for me and was disjointed and distracting.



The jokes, while some were funny, felt forced the entire time.


I did really like the opening intros of the squad and a lot of the pre prison release stuff. Thought there could have been a pretty cool prison shenanagins movie in there. Honestly i thought it was a decent if not dissapointing popcorn movie. I'm sure Hot Topic is thrilled at how there elaborate commercial turned out.",4w86a7
d65ls27,I thoroughly enjoyed it,4w86a7
d64x35s,"Ok I know people hate comparison between Marvel and DC but I can compare the feelings of getting out of Civil War and Suicide Squad.

d64ysrb,This was easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen.,4w86a7
d64ztav,"Genuinely don't understand the hate for this film. Even the comments about sloppiness. Maybe a bit in the first act but it definitely wasn't a ""mess"" of a film. Definitely wasn't a perfect film, but I honestly loved every second of it. The characters REALLY sold this film and Will Smith and Margot Robbie stole the show by a MILE. They killed it. The scene with Deadshot and Batman was fucking perfect. Seeing him, cape outstretched, gently descending behind Deadshot and his daughter...oh man...that was straight out of the animated series. 

It wasn't my favourite take on the Joker, but I will say to his credit, every second he was on screen, even though they were few, I was incredibly creeped out. He was unbelievably creepy. Which is cool. 
 
The supporting cast did great, especially El Diablo. Really enjoyed his backstory and motivations.

Overall, definitely the best DCCU film to date. Not perfect but 100% not deserving of the hate. 8/10 for me. ",4w86a7
d6523ob,"Awful. Leto's Joker was terrible, the pacing was bad, the writing was bad. God bless Robie, Smith, and Davis for being the only people here that actually tried. ",4w86a7
d655zm0,"Eh this movie was like a solid C imo, 7/10.

The plot was nonexistent and the editing was so choppy (rip in pieces), the trailers seemed better than this actual movie. 

I liked the characters more than I liked the story. Granted, there was p much no story due to the rushing and choppiness of this movie.
I will say I was impressed with Margot Robbie's acting, especially considering what she was given to work with. Harley was so sexualized and I feel like the writing for her character wasn't that great and could have definitely let her character soar more, so I think Margot Robbie did a great job as Harley.

Will Smith was a badass- I appreciated that. 

Viola Davis was a $TONE COLD KILLA

Jay Hernandez was p cool

Lol Cara can't act I'm sorry but she was just so bad

Karen Fukuhara I'm so sorry you had to play Katana like guys what the hell. First off, I thought she would get more screentime and you would see more of her but no, her story was really basic and you don't really get to see who she is. Second I just have issues with her name being so basic and like I would go in detail but this is about the movie and not Katana herself. Anyway Karen was fine, she was cool, Katana was just such a basic character.

Adam Beach- rip

Croc- comedic relief I guess

Boomerang- I literally could not care less

Scott Eastwood- why the hell were you in this movie????

Jared Leto- One more reason why I wish Heath Ledger were still alive, Jared's joker was ridiculous. Literally a green haired, unintimidating mob boss with a speech impediment who made little to no impression on me.

The soundtrack to this movie however, was quite spot on. I feel like the song choices and placement were mostly great choices.

I think this movies actions scenes are also great, so if you're just looking for some action scenes and Will Smith kicking ass, this movie is a pretty good choice. Just don't expect much of a plot.",4w86a7
d65gocr,"Did anyone else feel like they were watching ~~Hitchcock~~ Hancock again? Felt like the first and second halves of the movie were incredibly disconnected.

d65ygnu,"I just watched and I loved every minute, really don't get all the bad reviews it's getting.",4w86a7
d666xn8,"Good movie with noticeable flaws.

The only scene that was straight up bad was the Harley/Joker flashback in the club. The editing and writing for those scenes were terrible. In general, they didn't show Joker's possessiveness over Harley enough and played more to him actually liking her, which isn't quite accurate.

Characters were all good though, people complain about the second and third acts but that's when the film actually picked up for me, watching them all play off each other and fight together was really fun. 

Enchantress gets shit on alot but I can't think of a Marvel or DC villain as of late that I liked more than her. There's Loki and...um... Maybe Ultron? In other words she was pretty good. That fight scene against the SS was dope. Love the 6 v 1 with all the different fighting styles still not being enough to take her down.

Deadshot was GOAT. Will miss Diablo if they do a second.",4w86a7

The good:
Will Smith: now I see why they had him in it, they would have never made this trainwreck.

Harley:Decent, was actually insane, I liked her.

Waller: Yes, nailed the psychopath authoritarian and ruthlessness but was super incompetent and her mishandling of enchantress was just ignored by the US gov't because Murica.

Soundtrack is as bad as the Watchmen soundtrack. It felt like a giant music video that never ended. 

Joker: Can't spell letdown without the letters leto. A combination of Michael Corleone and Jim Carrey's Riddler. Not insane at all. Tatoos and smiley face on the hand made no sense. Purring, really. Who said he could kill common?

PG 13: Embrace the rating called R. Deadpool did. This could of been rated PG.

The other squad members and seal team were useless like Slipknot. How come he dies yet everyone else is given a pass. Underused Boomerang, the ninja chick, and Diablo turning into a god for no reason other than they ran out of ideas and dialogue? Deadshot not killing Harley: no explosion from Waller. Where did that damn phone come from that Harley had? Who disabled Harleys bomb? Why did she go back to stop Enchantress, she is a villain. Flag letting everyone off the hook in the bar was terrible. He should of been killed. June Moon living was so predictable. Croc looked horrendous, keep the hoody on.  

And no terrible dc movie is complete without Batfleck. He needed Wallers help to get the justice league members? I work with people now, heh. 

Well from here on out I am downloading/waiting to watch DC movies.  I would say this movie is about 20% as cool as Assault On Arkham. I am glad I watched that, too bad DCMU refuses to use their source material. 2 gigantic whiffs with The Killing Joke and now Suicide Squad.

I went in with the same expectations as I would with any shootem up movie and wasn't disappointed.

The underworld, gangster take on the Joker was probably my favorite thing about the execution of this movie. The way that his character and relationship with Harley affects the plot is perfect; we get to see enough of the Joker to love him, but just enough to get us excited when we find out that he survived the obviously nonfatal helicopter crash. Deadshot's storyline was really emotionally touching. 

I loved getting an in-depth look at all of these characters that I knew almost nothing about. I don't regret my ticket. :) ",4w86a7

d65krmi,"It was a bad film with good actors and fun characters. Its a fun popcorn movie, it doesn't deserve the massive hate garnered from the critics but it definitely doesn't deserve much praise either.

**Spoilers**

The entire plot is just a rip-off of another superhero movie that came out this year, X-Men Apocolypse. An ancient being wakes up after thousands of years of slumber, sees that humans do not worship them anymore, decides to try and takeover the world by building a giant structure and destroying humanities first line of defense. Enchantress as a character was cool, but as the main antagonist she was awful. I still don't understand what the ""machine"" was that she was building, or what her foot soldiers were or why they looked like that. The pacing was weird, a lot of scenes felt disjointed or rushed, Katana's inclusion was absolutely pointless and unnecessary. I wanted to like Jared Leto's Joker, but out of all of the characters I think he was my least favorite. The laugh was bad (sounding more like a quack) and very forced, not like a maniacal psychopath would sound. I didn't like his weird, sinusy growl that he did every scene, or the fact that he pined over Harley like a puppy dog (shouldn't it be the other way around?). He has potential, though, and there were a couple scenes where I did like him (like the helicopter scene). I think some of the scenes that were cut could add a lot to his character.

The redeeming quality comes from the actors and how they portrayed their characters and interacted with each other. Most of them are near-perfect translations of their comic book incarnations. Deadshot and Harley obviously stole the show, but Amanda Waller was surprisingly terrific as the cutthroat boss you love to hate. 

El Diablo was perfect, exactly what I would've wanted from his character and probably the truest translation from comic to movie. Captain Boomerang was hilarious, and I love how he tricked Slipknot into running off to test the bombs (just like in the comic). I felt like maybe he was a little too much of a team player and should've been more of a self-serving dick, and I didn't like that he came back at the end without any sort of motivation, but he was definitely one of my favorite characters. 

Killer Croc... well, he looked cool...when he had his hood on, anyway. He looked really goofy in any scene where he didn't have a shirt (his head was way too big for his body). I wish they had used a bodybuilder, or CGId him to look bigger. There's not really any exposition as to why he's in Belle Reeve other than he got chased out of Gotham by Batman. Its implied that he's a cannibal and murderer, but it would've been cool to see some of that (guess it would've been too much for a PG-13 movie). I didn't care for Rick Flagg one way or the other. I think its unfortunate that Tom Hardy dropped out, I think he would've done much better than Joel Kinnaman. 

The interactions and dialogue between characters were fun and entertaining, even if a little cheesy and melodramatic at times, and do a lot to save an otherwise pretty bad film. I'd grade it a 3/5. Its not nearly as bad/disjointed as BvS, and its definitely a step in the right direction for DCEU, even if its just a half step. I think if they were to make a sequel and find a better director and maybe have DC actually co-write the script, they could potentially have a great movie.",4w86a7
d65u78c,"I think that the movie is decent, I went into the theater with close to no expectations after BvS, and in the end I think it was worth the money, the one thing I didn't like the most is how they introduced the characters, it was cool imo but it felt too fast, and there was too much music, sure it might have been apropiate but still, you go into a theater to watch a movie, not to listen songs.

The two characters I didn't like were the pyro dude and killer croc, killer croc did actually something when he went underwater to arm the bomb, in rest he didn't do much, and the guy with flames was too much like hulk imo, can't control powers and then all of the sudden he can control his powers and can create this powerfull flame avatar.

Joker was meh imo, ik he isn't ledger but still it doesn't feel like joker, could be that I can't get over the old joker.

Strongest character imo was batman, even tho he gets close to no action time, I liked deadshot but at one point during the movie it felt like he was deadpool.",4w86a7

d674ljl,"Spoilers*

Just watched it with the wife who has never seen or given any fucks about hero/comic book type movies. I am a fan of the genre but find it has mostly gotten stale, besides Deadpool and Ant Man. She loved it and I did too. 

The joker was much more solid than expected. Like a no shit kingpin boss, just like the comics. He is well done and adds as part of a whole instead of orchestrating and elaborate attack. The checking in with Harley like a boyfriend coming through without showing the joker getting there was a spendid call. They did something great and new by having him actually feel a kind of Bonnie and Clyde twisted tainted broken under the bridge kind of love. He could have just been an ass the whole time like in the cartoon but this is way better.

Will Smith's best showing in a decade. Bravo there Fresh Prince!

Robbie absolutely killed it, you hear that critics, she fucking killed it! She is as fit to rock Harley as Reynolds is to rock Deadpool.

The previous DC flicks were so boring, they were nearly unwatchable. Suicide Squad is sharp, has a voice and characters that can be cared about, even with the niggling holes like: not going full R and dumb mannequin faceless hoards. 

Yes, some holes can be poked in it but really, who cares? The flick is a great strait up comic book adaptation, and better for it. ",4w86a7
d67cu4j,"This movie was ridiculously bad. Spoilers follow.

The plot made no sense, there was no reason for Harley to be on the team besides marketing. At least Black Widow was setup as the pre trusted member assigned by the leader, Harley is just a crazy person with a wooden bat and a revolver.

It was maybe the worst Joker that I've ever seen. There was no humor to him, dark or otherwise. No jokes, no charm, very little intimidation. He just looks like a dude who got a bunch of tattoos. That isn't scary, they aren't even ironic or funny tattoos. You can tell they wanted the Joker to be more physically attractive than usual to sell the Harley relationship and prep the audience for fandom.

The motivations are all over the place, first they work together for reduced sentences, but then they get bomb in their necks. However the threat of there heads coming off or the world being destroyed isn't enough, they need a pep talk from the fire pacifist about family.

I loved the binders that have top secret in bold letters, conveniently brought everywhere. These villains only know each other for what I'm assuming is like a few hours, they don't really save each other's lives, they don't go through something traumatic together to cement their relationship. 

So many of the lines were so very bad. Remember we're the bad guys.

I don't know what the other people saw that they actually liked. Even the fight scenes weren't good, besides maybe the 2 minutes of Diablo's true form. It was just Will Smith shooting at stuff, and without any of the amazing aim he boasted in previous scenes. Harley hits monsters with a wooden bat and does acrobatics, Croc slams down a couple guys with normal muscular guy strength.

If you want to see a better version, watch the animated movie for Suicide Squad. Harley is there because they need her crazy to help figure out a Joker scheme, at least they tried to make it make some sense.

Edit: I'm going to add what I liked.

Soundtrack, Margot's performance overall, Smith's performance overall, Enchantress first transformation.",4w86a7
d64xh32,"Absolutely hated it.

The story just plods along with no real sense of cohesion between one moment and the next. The actual main villain of the film wasn't a terrible idea at all, but it was horribly executed. I felt virtually nothing for any of the characters at any point in the film thanks to phoned in acting and shoddy dialog. The musical score was about as lazy as they come, relying too much on catchy songs that don't really seem to fit quite right. The biggest letdown for me had to be Joker. Leto is damn talented, and I feel there was a lot of potential for his take on the character, but the overall horrible execution of the film just ruins it. You could cut nearly every scene he's in save for some flashbacks and nothing of value would be lost.

I really hope this is just a ""rebuilding"" year for DC, because at this rate I'm not sure I should hold out hope for Wonder Woman, let alone Justice League.

Kudos to whomever put together the trailers for Suicide Squad, though, because they got me to fully buy in to what ended up being a waste of my evening.",4w86a7
d64ziwb,"I may be the only person who genuinely liked BvS (especially the ultimate cut) but fucking HATED this movie. It didn't even feel like a movie to me. Just a bunch of short little clips mashed together. Joker was wasted, the villain was shit, and the editing was jarring as fuck. I'm so disappointed. I've been a DC apologist for awhile (you can check my comment history) but I have no excuse for this movie. ",4w86a7

d658b7e,"My girlfriend /u/eyeofhorus79 and I saw a screener on Wednesday. This is my review that I have posted elsewhere.

Suicide Squad

What was almost a disaster of a movie and movie going experience turned out to be highy enjoyable. Yesterday at noon, I unsubscribed from all my movie and comic forums, facebooks and twitters. I broke once to check out two trusted critics. One hated SS and another loved it. Things didn't look good. Then I got an email from WB saying the screening was overbooked and to arrive as early as 1 hour before. My girlfriend and I both work until 5:30 so that was cutting it close with the theater 20 minutes away and a 7pm start.

I hauled out of work and we got to the theater at 6 sharp. We were somewhere back near the entrance to the lobby in a huge line from the entrance to the theater and half the line already got in. We didn't think we would make it. Turns out we were less than 10 people from being cut off. Inside we couldn't find a seat, every seat appeared taken, so two studio reps started looking for us. My girlfriend ended up in the front row while they tried to find one for me. Suddenly, a wild nice old lady appears and says she has two right next to each other. They were smack dab in the middle of the theater. The perfect seats. It was like our Lord and Savior, Geoff Johns (praise be!) came down and shined a light on them. Movie saved.

I won't go into spoiler details, but Suicide Squad was just shy of what I was expecting. I don't know if the screener was different from what the critics saw, but it wasn't the doom and gloom I read. The very packed theater of 455 people really seemed to enjoy it. The whole place kept laughing of what seemed to be a mixed crowd. An old lady to my left, young kids behind us, young adults and middle aged folk in what I fully expected to be a neckbeard festival with nothing but Flash and GL shirts (I own both). Yet, it seemed like I was the only DC nerd there giggling under my breath when Captain Boomerang started talking with Slipknot.

The theater was electric to say the least which is very different from the premier night of BvS. BvS had the crowd just kind of like “Welp :/” when it was all over. Suicide Squad had people laughing quite a bit and some clapped when it was over. The entire the theater seemed to have a nice buzz about it.

Neither myself or or my girl who hates, just hates BvS could figure out the pacing issues critics had. It's a bit heavy upfront with character introductions, which is more of a 20 minute montage, but I doubt most could tell you anything about Amanda Waller or Enchantress, so the intros, complete with Zombieland-ish fact sheets, were welcome. 

Amanda Waller is a mean bitch and just perfect. So cruel. If you're not familiar with her, she is the only person who can make Batman blink.

Oh and Batman… This is the Batman like I have never seen him on film. He fucking cares and he has empathy. It was a moment straight from the comics. Not panel for panel like “I Believe You” in BvS, but a small moment that shows his character. The way he told Deadshot he didn't want to take him down in front of his daughter. Just awesome.

Here is the bad: Villain is weak, I can't say more than that. The Joker suuuuuucks. He has very, very little screentime, so it's almost a non issue. It's not Leto's fault either, it's the style he was given to portray and the way he was written. Modern day gangsta Joker and I hate it. Will Smith plays Will Smith, but not once did he say “aw hell no.” And Deadshot was written as Will Smith, so it doesn't make it a bad decision. I like the dude, so his grounded character works.

Solid movie. 3 of 4 stars and didn't pay much fan service as much as it pandered to audiences for laughs. There isn't a whole lot of substance here, just a popcorn script and action fun..

d68ev4r,"I just saw it.

Honestly, I thought it sucked. I was incredibly underwhelmed and disappointed, I wanted SO bad to like this movie. I thought BvS, while flawed, got a bit more hate than it deserved. But this was just a straight up mess. Will Smith was good, Robbie was fantastic and made the movie watchable. Leto was totally underused as the Joker, I can't even say whether I thought he was good or not because he barely got any screentime. Hopefully in the Batman movie.

The story was a mess and bad, the villains were bad, and honestly, the movie was just boring. BvS had some great scenes in it, like the batmobile chase. There's not one scene from this movie that sticks out in my mind as really memorable, and I just got out of the theater 20 minutes ago.",4w86a7
d68jcb7," My wife and I saw it today in the theater.

It was alot of fun, not Oscar-worthy, but worth the money. Harley Quinn was **hot as fuck**, and Will Smith was great as Deadshot- I wish we had more of him honestly. Jared Leto was without a doubt the creepiest Joker i've ever seen, but I think he did a good job- like Smith, I don't think we got enough of him in this movie. The beginning of the movie was a little slow- especially with the long introductions- but once Waller kinda brought them all together, that's when it became fun and exciting.

That all being said, aside from The Dark Knight, I think it was my favorite DC movie I've seen. I'm more of a Marvel fan personally, so i'm kinda bias though. The last DC movie I saw was Man of Steel (still haven't seen BvS yet) and we really liked it, but the pacing was long as hell.",4w86a7
d651f2o,"OK So here's the review I just posted on FB. I watch a lot of movies and generally post reviews there.. TL:DR I liked it despite the popular opinion. Feel free to comment complain etc. Edit: I actually went into this movie fairly blind to keep outside opinions from influencing mine. I know/knew enough about the characters involved and the DC universe to not be a completely uniformed person.
Edit 2: Ok I forgot the enchantress gyrating like a drunken 3rd rate stripper while casting the Big bad spell. I think my brain tried desperately to block that out. So add that to the ""Things I didn't like.

Ok So how do I not spoil Suicide Squad? So We'll start at the beginning Great opening and Origin establishment without spending half the movie getting us there, Each of the characters were well developed and written their introductions were brief but very well done.
The story line takes place after the events of Batman V Superman and this was established in a few brief sentences not a god awful long flashback.
The BBGE(Big Bad Guy at the End) actually surprised me and I'm generally not surprised.
Things I loved about it.
- The Joker/Harley love story mixed in well and was a plot point without feeling forced. Probably the closest we are going to get Live action Joker movie.
- The pacing was good, it moved quickly on many points. Origin of characters, the establishment of timeline, the reason for them creating the team, the BBGE showing up, the characters moving to the final showdown. Even the fight scenes were fast paced without being a Micheal bay shaky-cam fest.
- The story was solid it had enough callbacks and easter eggs for the fans and was written in a way that a non nerd or someone unfamiliar with the world can follow without having to do research beforehand.
- There were a couple of tissue moments for the lady friends so take an opportunity to get a cheap hug/feel in.
Things I didn't like
- Three of the characters felt forced and not a necessary element for the movie. Katana, Slip-Knot and Captain Boomerang. The last being a poor attempt at a funny character. Mostly Frat humor and his delivery was awful. They could have grabbed an extra from Animal house and done the same thing.
- Making the bad guys likable. OK I get that as Americans we love our heroes. However giving some of the main characters a misunderstood bad guy thing was just off. I would have liked these characters as the bad asses they were without some misunderstood evil trope thrown in.
- Predictable ending well almost. Yes true love conquers all in the noble sacrifice of the triumphant heroes walking away in the sunset and everyone lives happily ever after. These tropes were in there. However there were a few spins on them to not surprise me but  help to alleviate the Oh God not this ending again.
Overall I liked this movie. Definitely a thrill ride and not just a popcorn flick for me. I had several pleasant surprises and a couple of disappointments. If they continue to learn from the mistakes of Batman V Superman and continue with this level of pacing and story line I have hopes for the DCEU.

d653pcl,"Really liked this flick. Does not deserve the trashing it's getting, I think a lot of people went into this movie looking to hate it and nitpick every little thing. Best DCEU movie yet. Diablo was awesome and stole the show imo. Joel Kinnaman, Margot Robbie, Will Smith, and Viola Davis all totally nailed their roles. This movie also did a much better job at the expanded universe stuff than Dawn of Justice. The Flash and Batman were used well, enough to connect the universe, but not enough to steal the show from the main characters of the movie. The set up for future villains was the best part of this movie, and those benefits wont be seen until the Batfleck solo movies. Because of this movie the Batfleck solo film villains will be strong characters that we are already connected to, they will be great villains that you actually care about, and thats something that most recent comic films including this one have struggled with. I want to see all of these characters show up again, so the movie nailed it on that.

Can't wait to see a Batfleck movie with these villains. Most notably, I cant wait to see more of Leto's Joker. Aside from the new look, it felt like comic Joker was ripped straight from the page. Hijacking the chopper, the chemical vat scene, the exploding gift basket, the attacks by his crew wearing the panda masks, and the ending jail break were pure Joker. I loved how his tactical SWAT gear had ""Joker"" on the chest and on the helmet, just straight up pure comic book Joker right there. I can picture Leto Joker having a scene like [this in my head already.](http://67.media.tumblr.com/b097f4318c7446444021fa36d34d65a1/tumblr_nh0ygkgHsh1rawb5do1_500.jpg)",4w86a7

The problems is besides Margot Robbie and Will Smith, no other squad member gets any lines of dialogue. And I legitimately mean lines of dialogue - there are certain points in the film where it's just Will Smith talking and it cuts from character to character to show their reactions.  Outside of those two and Rick Flag, there's no character development - nothing to get us invested in any of these characters who we're supposed to get to know.  I feel it tries to be Guardians of the Galaxy but fails (they also used ""Spirit in the Sky"" which I found quite funny).

Leto is fine as the Joker.  He absolutely doesn't try to be Ledger and what little he's in does not take away or add to the film.

The best way I could put it is that this film just exists.  It doesn't do anything crazy and doesn't try anything new. But hey - there's explosions! And monsters! And more explosions! And now Harley Quinn made a funny joke! Now Will Smith is talking about stuff! That's basically the film in a nutshell.

That said however, once again, it's a generic CGI fest where the villain wants to destroy the world. I LOVE Cara Delevingne but she was really bad in the ending, I couldn't help think how more ridiculous she would be without special effects because they made her gyrate for the last act and it was awkward.

d6529nf,"Didn't like it. I think it would be better as a TV show. As a movie, none of the characters were given adequate time, very few scenes were long enough, and the whole movie felt very rushed. An R-rating also would have helped, at least for the comedy. Most of the jokes seemed a little neutered.

I do like DC action more than Marvel action. Here at least, and in Batman's scenes in BvS, you could tell what was going on, where people were, what their hits were doing. That's my biggest complaint with Marvel movies; their action is just a flurry of movement and the bad guy is down. Plus, Jared Leto and Margot Robbie did great. I'm ready for that movie. 

That being said, another movie where a city is destroyed, another movie with a faceless slave army that the good guys can kill consequence free and where the stakes are so high that they just stop mattering. So disappointingly predictable. 

Plus, a DC specific complaint: they make these movies around moments. Put so much time and effort into an awesome shot or few seconds, and hope that the audience will be riding that high till the next one. If you pack in enough moments and make them seem effortless (Fury Road, John Woo movies) it works; if you only have a few and nothing really to back it up, not so much.

d65eg2q,"I found it to be...satisfactory.  Could have been better, could have been much worse.  Two things in particular that I enjoyed:

* There was not even the remotest pretense that Amanda Waller is a good person.  A person with some--*some*, mind you--good intentions, but ultimately barely a step above the criminals she's conscripting as far as basic humanity is concerned....which is just as it should be.  Personality-wise, a solid contender with *Justice League Unlimited* for best depiction of ""The Wall"" in an adaptation to date.

* The marked difference in the Joker-Harley relationship from every other depiction in and out of comics--a Joker who actually seems to both want and *need* Harley by his side.  Not just as arm candy, not as the patsy to take the fall or hold the line while he escapes, not someone whom he will let languish in jail until such time as he needs an accomplice again.  Sure, he goes for self-preservation first when their car goes into the water, but the sheer amount of resources alone that the Joker devotes in this movie to reuniting with Harley, including breaking her out of Belle Reve at the end, is more than any other incarnation of the Joker has ever done for his Harley Quinn; Harley is currently a solo character in the comics precisely because she finally realized how little she truly means to ""Mistah J"".  For whatever twisted reasons he has, this Joker truly wants Harley as a partner in crime, and shows it.",4w86a7

I don't expect films to be perfect and there are plenty of deeply flawed movies that I love but this is something else.

I had constant feeling like I was missing something as I watched it.  Like I had missed a scene or part of the dialogue because nothing seemed to fit between scenes.

I couldn't suspend my disbelief through the boredom and annoyance at the constant blaring of the soundtrack.  The music was a huge distraction for me.

My favorite moment of the movie was the shot of one of the lightning bolts cutting what looked like an aircraft carrier (maybe?) in half followed by a shot of the war room in Washington watching the exact same event.  I guess the NSA has cameras on buoys.

They shouldn't have taken out the abusiveness of the Joker/Harley relationship.

It was really nice to see Will Smith actually act and he didn't the do the ""black man's yell"" once through the whole thing.

That bar scene was a cringe minefield.

Enchantress appearance was dope; the way Delevinge moved while in that costume was really great.

I liked the cameos with Batman/Flash.

I feel like Beach was in there just to say 'look, we have some real diversity going on here'.

It was interesting seeing Batman and Joker as backup characters, it's not the way that usually shakes out. 

I really liked the bar scene and the prison parts particularly, as it really gives causation to their attitudes. And the backstory with Joker and Harley was well done too. 

Leto nailed it as Joker. He really did and I'm saying that as someone who is definitely not a fan of Leto's work.

One thing I liked a lot about the film was that there was actual god damned consequences during the end fight. There's a sacrifice that needs to be made and someone makes it and I was a little saddened that character had come to an abrupt end.

d68npct,"Just Saw Suicide Squad and it was more than just borderline worth it or even worthless as far as critics are concerned.

Suicide Squad: 3-3.5/5 stars

Bad points:

-choppy story-line. though, viewers are made aware of certain plots later on in the movie.  [spoilers](#s ""Example: the train station scene where Incubus kills a train-load of people is slightly further explained by Flag later on when explaining to the squad."")

-use of Eminem's song was totally unnecessary especially in the scene it is used in.

Good points:
99% of the bad points the critics mentioned (other than the story-line being choppy) are actually the good points along with a very few ones critics mentioned too! namely:

-critics said ""Cara Delevingne's character 'Enchantress' is mostly dancing in the movie waving body and arms, what is this?...she is the main villain?...stupid!"". My Reply: ""you do know the Enchantress is a Succubus yes?, a Succubus be it in Dragon age origins, Marvel, DC or books or any other media is always believed to be sexually attractive to men and women and are said to do those kinda moves per say. Plus [spoilers](#s ""in the movie she isn't just dancing but she actually fights the team for a very short bit and tries to play with their mind like an enchantress or a succubus should and while she is 'dancing' she isn't actually 'dancing' but there's stuff flowing off her body to that junk in the sky which she is using to craft something."")
-critics said ""wanted the joker more!!"". My Reply: ""he was used just the right amount actually. It's not a batman movie and joker is a batman main villain not a suicide squad villain. Also, he doesn't just come and go in a few seconds of the movie but is sprinkled around [spoilers](#s ""comes at the very end before end-credits scene again for Harley"").

-yet again bat-fleck was amazing. during the [spoilers](#s ""deadshot vs. batman"") scene Ben Affleck was brilliant. Sad and insulting how there's a piss-port meme out there that reads sad-affleck..even in that short scene the main focus of the movie in deadshot played by Will Smith looses all its charisma and becomes almost like a side character.

-Flash, for the 5 seconds that he is in a scene looked brilliant in it.

-Harley Quinn's and Joker's chemistry just was brilliant. (as certain critics said)

-the main plot points of the story leading to the encounter of suicide squad and enchantress (Succubus) was fulfilled as far as this particular movie's choppy story-line are concerned even with all the ""chopping"". yet i would again appeal to the WB studio to stop being so old generational and cutting the movie down to satisfy their presumed movie run-time. a 3 hour movie in case of Marvel or DC does wonders as compared to a shorter one or if you do have to keep it in 2-2.5 hours, well make the directors create a movie that satisfies the run-time properly without you interfering in their work or stupendously chopping a movie or panicking like young scared kids and having the writers of your said movie rush through a script.

-to me Suicide Squad was less musical than BvS.

-the use of ""bad vs. worse"" part of the movie was perfect. usually a movie like this would show a bad guy become a good guy and defeat the villain but that's plain stupid. in here the bad guys remain the bad guys till the end. but to my surprise that is not a positive to most people!! and that totally weird.

-its completely enjoyable along with the action and everything (even the chopped up story-line) but only if you go in there thinking you are about to watch a movie that is not a MARVEL movie. i wonder if its just coz these are also Comic-book movies that everyone readily springs to 1st think about Marvel. and that is just unjust of everyone. if i see 2 people who are totally different but both work in the same theatre/shop/business and if i have met with 1 of the 2 should that directly mean that i should presume the other fellow by the qualities of the previous one just coz they are both a shopkeeper/theatre clerk? no, they both have their own ups and downs and i would judge them by themselves rather than each other.

ALSO:
some other fans go the lengths of petitions (or as i call then pititions..) and fanatically crying over the internet be it DC or Marvel and of those don't work they start quarrelling with people they don't know at all about this nonsense Comicbook-Vs-Comicbook war of words. now i do agree that among marvel and dc i was 1st introduced to dc (after the Archies) so im more of a dc fan (but not hardcore fan or fanatic that would blindly go yes-man on every DC movie and cry over bad reviews and insult Marvel fans and such) but i love the fuck outa Deadpool and Punisher comics and x-men too (not Avengers or civil war, currently eyeing to read civil war 2 though!) so there's this love of dc that fans would understand but not fanatics of either side. but either ways i would understand why those fanatics or even certain fans are pititioning and crying over the failure of this movie. the critics are blind-eyed rating the movie by being just as fanatical coz they are not doing their job of seeing a movie for its own but are seeing a dc movie by keeping MCU in mind..DC and Marvel are 2 totally different brothers from the same mother (comics books). stop generalising between the 2 and calling yourselves 'critics'. either do you job and stop being just as penis-less as news-channel hosts who can go to the length of dividing a whole nation and creating in-fights and making people kill other people just for the sake of TRP, views, cash and fame. general people are gullible (esp if they don't exactly know the source material of a comic-book movie those unaware people are about to watch) don't take an advantage of that and hurt something that doesn't completely deserve that so very much of it. (as far as what my experience in the theatre i went was i would say critics are absurdly wrong. i didn't see people leaving the auditorium in a rage over the movie after the auditorium was full. I didn't hear anyone around me utter words of pain at the movie or themselves.. many were laughing and enjoying.)",4w86a7
d64v2nh,"The movie was alright. 

Unfortunately that's pretty much how I rate it. I wanted to love it, and I honestly tried to, but the plot is all over the place.

Let's start with the good stuff. The characters. Most of the main cast was pretty good. Harley Quinn was great, although perhaps sometimes a bit too lolrandom! Deadshot was good, surprisingly turned out to be the funniest character in the film. Rick Flagg was functional. Killer Croc was slightly underwhelming and underutilized, mostly incomparable to his comic book counterpart. Captain Boomerang was pretty fun and Slingshot was utterly useless. 

Unfortunately, that's about where the good ends. 

Joker was unfortunately wasted. I can't tell if it was just awful writing that made him come across so poorly of if it's just Leto's interpretation of his character. He seemed to err too close to being random for the sake of it. He was fairly intimidating in maybe one scene, but asides from that he was just a distraction to the rest of the film. I sincerely hope a better writer and director are paired with him next time. 

The action was average, and there isn't a single outstanding set piece that stands out. No scene to look back on and reminisce about how awesome it was.

The music was cool, but at times it was a bit overwhelming and it distracted from the film.

The cinematography was mostly invisible. There were a few nice looking shots but even fewer meaningful shots.

The pacing was all over the show. Scenes didn't always transition well, and at times jokes were interspersed in really awkward places (the 'We're bad guys, it's what we do!' joke was awkwardly placed).

The villain was fairly poor. Her motivations were logical enough but not substantiated with any scenes so they felt hollow. Her appearance before she gets a power up from her brother was *very* cool and creepy, and I *loved*
 loved loved her first transformation in the office. But after her transformation she looked awful and fake. She didn't do much during the course of the film, and she kept doing this strange hip shaking thing. 

The worst thing about the film as a whole though, was the plot. A lot of stuff didn't really make sense to me, and I was left questioning a fair few character decisions during the film. And ultimately, the film never sold me on the fact that these characters are bad guys. That was without a doubt the most disappointing thing. I can understand trying to make characters relatable but asides from the backstories we get about the characters, they never really act like bad guys. They stand up for each other, they don't take golden opportunities to escape and pursue freedom (asides from Slipknot and he was literally just in the film to die), and in the end they do the right thing without needing to have their arms bent behind their backs. 

I don't know what to say really. The movie wasn't awful, but it was awfully forgettable, and as I sit here just an hour or two after watching it, I've already started to forget most of it.

**Final Rating: 6/10**

**EDIT: ** Notice how I didn't mention Katana. That's because she serves absolutely *no purpose* in the film. She may as well not have been there.... I forgot El Diablo too, but that's just on me. He had a function, but it wasn't a well realized one and the movie wouldn't have suffered terribly from his absence even though I liked having him there.",4w86a7

d64xkm0,"I don't understand how this movie got such a poor critical response.  (Well I do, comparisons to Deadpool which was an undeniably better film)  The movie was fun, had likeable characters,  and a crazy comic book plot.  That is really all you need to have an enjoyable movie.  Obviously it isn't going to be bust down doors at awards shows, but it's a superhero movie so that wasn't really the point.

I absolutely loved the character introductions, though I was sad they didn't give Slipknot one since it confirmed what everyone expected well before it happened.   Margot Robbie and Will Smith did phenomenal jobs and were obviously the stars of the show, but Digger Harkness really made the movie for me.  He didn't have a lot of lines or motivation throughout the film, but he felt like a Rogue come to life.  From his pleas of innoncence when he first shows up to the landing site to the fact he had a beer in his hand almost the whole movie, he was excellent.   

Even though, Leto clearly took his method acting over the top, I quite enjoyed his Joker.  He actually felt like the most realistic Joker we've gotten on the big screen.  His behavior on set was absolutely on necessary, but I liked his Joker.

People will likely complain the characters bonded so quickly and honestly it probably could have done better, but I was more than willing to accept it.  They were in some shit and had a common enemy (Waller) from the beginning.  I am willing to believe that brought them together without an explicit exposition.

Overall, I had a blast watching the movie and really enjoyed the way it was themed.  It wa Hot Topic-y, but that actually felt right given the ensemble the were working with.  

 **Overall, I thought it was a fun movie that didn't apologize for its insane comic book premise.  I would give it a 7.5/10.**  It was good and enjoyable.  It certainly wasn't  as good as Deadpool (though I really don't think it was trying to be anything like Deadpool)  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking a fun unapologetic movie or any comic fans.

I can see how some people disliked Leto's Joker, as he seemed like less of a mad dog and more of a mobster in love, but I think his portrayal fits the tone of this universe so far. Will Smith as Will Smith was enjoyable, as usual. Margot Robbie's Harley was great. She pulled off the quick spurts of lucidity quite well. Joel Kinnamon did a good job at playing his character as written; the issue was that his character was written kind of boring. When I saw Viola Davis was cast as Waller, I was expecting her HTGAWM character with government-ness, but her performance was markedly unique.

The soundtrack was awesome, if a bit over-powering at times.

Only complaint- the plot seemed to just be the first excuse that the writers thought of to have these characters come together.

This was definitely paced like a weekly release of a comic, where each plot point started and ""ended"" then moved to the next ""release"" and I really like that. Loved Boomerang, loved Joker/Harley, Batman inclusion was perfectly minimal and impactful, Will Smith was Will Smith and maybe a little too focused on, Katana was freaking awesome and Killer Croc was surprisingly fun - I did not expect to like him, but the ""B.E.T."" line was perfectly apropos to this character we were learning to love. The ""boss fight"" was great, I loved using each person's skills to get it done, that was so perfectly DC of them...

Overall, I get the feeling Suicide Squad is more in-line with the first ""round"" of Marvel superhero movies (Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, etc).

d66hpbi,"THIS MOVIE DID NOT GIVE ME ENOUGH TIME TO BREATH!

Please, don't get me wrong. I love the characters when they are on screen, but there was absolutely no time to let me become properly acclimated to their back story. I felt like the movie dropped me into the scenes, and expected me to feel an immediate connection to the characters. For example, the Rick/Enchantress romance was completely pushed and I didn't buy it. I felt like I was watching a very extended trailer instead of a movie.

There was a TON, and I mean SEVERAL STORY LINES, worth of material there to make me feel sympathetic to the villains. Every member of the Squad has a background that can be very tragic, but we are introduced to them in a very rushed manner. This does not allow me to become fully invested in them.

The editing definitely played a role is how I perceived it. We begin with Dead Shot and Harley off the back. When we got to the first flashback with the Joker, her was just there. All the introductions felt underwhelming. The scenes felt rush. If we got to have some point of view, such at the prison guard or Viola, to explain their history (or to at least narrate it), it would of been easier to follow.
Instead, we have a very 'Fast edited' story line where we are not allowed to become properly invested in the characters or the story line.

The Enchantress was a paint-by-numbers villain! We were TOLD that she and Rick Flag were lovers, but it could of made a very solid story line. I wish the movie spent more time on how Rick fell in love only to only to have it taken away by the witch. They had a great chance to explore the duality of Professor Moon's life. If they introduced the Enchantress for Professor Moon's point of view, they could gave a more horrific side of enchantress (further) developing her as the Big Evil of the movie.

Will Smith played Dead Shot very well. That shooting scene was fantastic! The rest of the Squad seemed just okay. Although, I wish we got more background on Katana and her blade. I would of loved to see a flashback on how she let her husband down and why she feels so determined to do right by him. Same for Boomerang. What was the point of the Unicorn doll? It seemed to serve a comedic plot, but could of easily served to add layers to his characters. Did it belong to someone he failed to save or given to him by his mother or sister? We could of been given a background on this to allow us to know where his character is coming from.

Harley and the Joker seemed great for there scenes, but the Joker could have been utilized much better. His scenes were heavily edited down. We never got ""That scene with the Joker"" which would of been memorable. He was shoved into the story line.  The first scene with him felt very underwhelming. Why is he so crazy? We could of started with Harley reading his profile as he is brought into the room We are expected to accept him as crazy, but are given no clues to help us figure out why. It was very frustrating especially since that could have given us a reason to invest in his story line with Harley. I did love Harley's character whenever she was on camera however. Margret Robbie was on point with the voice and quirks.

Overall, it was a fun movie. I enjoyed it after I got past plot holes. The best way I can put it is that we live in a ""Post-Game of Thrones"" world. As audiences, we expect story lines to develop and matter in a way that we can feel invested. If anything feels out of place, we will point it out. I would say the lack of scenes being full scenes and bad editing ruined the movie story wise.",4w86a7

It felt like they had a 30 minute idea and stretched it out.

The climactic scenes felt forced.

None of the characters really change or grow at the end = Nothing really happens.

Deadshot was unconvincing.

Joker had no style or groove and was unconvincing as well. He felt like a made-for-tv version of the comic book character, maybe something you'd see on the CW.

Quinn was okay, but a lot of her lines were wasted on the trailers. Plenty of butt shots though, thanks Warner Bros.

I enjoyed it. My GF liked it, and the 30+ people there for a 1:00 showing seemed to like it (no clappers luckily, that drives me crazy). It was a fun story, cool characters, and I thought the plot worked. Wasn't a fan of Harley getting the best of the villain, but they had to give her something big since she had no superpowers.

Will Smith played Will Smith and if it wasn't for him this movie would stand zero chance and complete failure.

d68shwa,"Thought it was really ""meh"". Maybe a 5 or 6 (at best) out of 10. Only reason I didn't go lower was because I thought it had its moments and I was somewhat entertained at times.
 
The main villains were really lame. Those zombie things were a joke... The only decent characters were Waller, Harley, Deadshot, apart from that everyone was forgettable and pointless. Rick Flag was as interesting as a piece of cardboard. 

There was also something wrong with the pacing/editing. Maybe if they make another extended cut like BvS it might make it easier to watch but unfortunately it won't solve the problems with the awful villains and forgettable characters. The action scenes were pretty boring too. And Jared Leto's Joker was nothing special from what they showed here.

So apart from a few solid performances, the only other positive is that I liked it when Batman showed up, can't wait for his solo film.",4w86a7
d69c7vj,"Thinking about it, they must've come up with the idea of Enchantress trying to kill all humans first, then forced the Suicide Squad into that story, where they don't belong. And then crammed the Joker in on top of that, where he doesn't belong. They completely screwed up the concept of the Suicide Squad.

And then instead of focusing on relationships within the group, they spend a ton of time on the characters relationships outside the group: Deadshot and his daughter, Harley and Joker, Diablo and his wife and kids, Flag and Moone, Katana and her soul sword, etc. And then all of a sudden they are a team and fighting a super-powered witch for whatever reason.

On a different note, why would Waller's helicopter shoot off a shit ton of flares right after taking off from the rooftop? Here I am, come shoot me down!! I'm guessing that footage was meant for something else and they just used it there because they had it and thought it looked cool.

Despite being a train-wreck of a movie, I thought it was still entertaining enough. Had potential to be great. DC needs to get things figured out, learn how to make movies that fit the characters, and realize that not every story needs to have a ""fate of the world"" type of conflict. The trailer for Wonder Woman looks promising though.",4w86a7
d69vjbb,"Wonderful summary of the movie. I was really worried the Suicide Squad cannot bring Tom back! Nobody wants Tom to get trapped inside a cat's body forever! But fortunately it was not inside a pink unicorn's body. Harley's performance in taking care of Tom was wonderful, as if she has handled cats all her life! Mr. J was very understanding and did not blow the kitty's head off! The cat was not harmed at all, not burned, not cut off, not really possessed by evil spirits (Tom is not evil). Overall, movie could do better but it was a fun one to watch. ",4w86a7
d6abmdi,"Bit late to the party, but more than anything this movie made me sad. I was hoping for something that would rejuvenate the DC Extended Universe after two rather 'meh' films, but I think the hype around this ultimately doomed it. They could have done a lot better honestly, I wanted to see the Joker be the main villain. I just thought having the Enchantress was a bit stupid – like others have said, *surely* they would get Batman and Wonder Woman to come fight this thing, not a bunch of off-the-rope villains. I thought Margot Robbie was worse than I thought she'd be as Harley Quinn, but she still wasn't bad. Jared Leto was a decent enough Joker, Will Smith was good as Deadshot but ultimately I think poor script writing let him down.

Interesting to see what DC do now. They obviously haven't found a style or rhythm that really fits and allows them to create a sufficient series of films like Marvel have been able to. I honestly think they should shut this down and start again. Maybe start with various films based on one character (an independent Batman film, an independent Superman film, an independent Aquaman film) and have them meet in a fourth or fifth film called Justice League if there's demand for it. Leave the independent films open so they're all sort of loosely linked but also enjoyable on their own. I feel people at DC HQ are panicking seeing what Marvel are doing, are desperate to try and one-up them and are therefore rushing out films that aren't well-written and have crap plots. 

Batman v Superman was recoverable I think, but this was really not very good. I liked the characters but they were let down by a disjointed plot. ",4w86a7

I'd rather watch this over half of the Marvel films, which are so bland and uninteresting at this point that I still look forward to DC films more than them.

I enjoyed the character interactions and I thought the actors did a great job. I think it could have been much better with an R rating and a lot less cut scenes, from the looks of it there was a lot more that had been filmed but was cut to keep it rated PG-13 or to shorten. If they come out with a directors cut I would definitely buy it. I think WB's interference probably ruined a lot of the good parts of the movie. ",4w86a7
d6700uo,"Just saw it and was pleasantly surprised. It was what it was supposed to be, a fun and exciting summer movie. I don't mind their approach to introducing each person, it's different and that's fine with me. I don't mind the music blocks for certain scenes, then again I've enjoyed music over action since Mean Streets. 

I think it was well done, I wished there would have been a bigger villain but too well known would have taken away from the group itself. The Joker wasn't anything great but again, I don't think he should be in this movie, if anything he's another cameo like batman. That's not to say I was pleased with leto's performance, I just wan't expecting much because he's not central to the group.

As with the comic books, they always add new characters which is fun, I hope they continue with the group or at least bring them in Justice League. 

I thoroughly enjoyed Suicide Squad, it was better than X-Men: Apocalypse and more entertaining than Civil War. The character development was better, the cinematography was better, the approach was different which is refreshing, and the effects were well done. This wasn't an epic award winning movie, it's a fun summer action super hero flick, I think people have the wrong expectations going into this. But I enjoyed it.",4w86a7
d68qk8i,What a disappointment. This is the worst blockbuster movie this year.,4w86a7
d6511oc,"Thouroughly disappointed by this. If I had to sum it all up in one word, it would be 'forced'.

Everything, from the character development to the plot line seemed forced, the plot was predictable, there was no flow in the story. It seemed to me they made the movie for the sole purpose of churning out good trailers from it.

As for the Joker, it was as if a 2 year old kid pukes and then wipes his hands with it, granted he didn't have much screen time as compared to Heath Ledger's joker but still I didn't see any thing that would make this one stand out in any way, it should be forgotten and buried lest it should tarnish the memory of the Joker we had with Heath Ledger.

d661ln3,"I don't even know where to begin with this movie, it was awful to say the least. Pacing issues throughout, characters had little to no depth and all of the sudden they're a family? There was no need for Katana or Killer Croc in this movie except to fill some sort of stereotype. Diablo was a passenger the entire time except for the little exposition about his family and why he didn't fight, Jared Leto was okay but he felt like your average mob gangster. Honestly, Joel Kinnamann was decent at times but most of his dialogue fell really flat and he sounded so manufactured. Slipknot was your obvious plot device and holy shit what an intro for such an influential character! Will Smith was Will Smith, I didn't see the character of Deadshot at all in this movie even though he had the best action sequence in the film. Margot Robbie was great as Harley Quinn and I really hope we see more of her with Jared Leto in a standalone Batman with a much better script and screenplay. Cara Delevingne was so bland and just not suitable in her role as Enchantress. Overall, great movie though.. not really. ",4w86a7

Some positives, Will Smith did a good job, but I think Margot Robbie did great. I thought she really nailed the character and she had me laughing throughout the movie, although she had a couple of stupid cheesy lines. Jared Leto did right by The Joker, even though I have to be honest I wasn't crazy about this version of The Joker. In all honesty it's probably just because I loved Ledgers joker and even Nicolson's version of the joker so much.   
A lot of negatives, character development was terrible. Killer Croc was just there, Katana was also just there. I mean she literally showed up out of nowhere and she had a brief 30 seconds that really didn't explain who she was. At the moment when she got on her knees and started crying to her dead husband I really didn't feel anything, all I know is that her name is Katana and she has a dead husband whose soul is trapped in a sword. Diablo started warming up to me, but then at the bar when he talks about killing his family, I really didn't feel bad for him at all, I felt like I still didn't really know him. When he died I didn't get sad or anything. I kind of just thought ""whatever"". Boomerang was the comic relief, who at times was enjoyable, but other times was just not necessary. 
At the end of the movie my friend turned to me and said ""5/10"" I thought the score he gave was appropriate and I can see that, but I truly didn't hate the movie like I did with BvsS. But I do believe the DC cinematic universe is off to a 0/3 start as I'm seeing most people agree.",4w86a7

d650d0h," I went into Suicide Squad without reading any reviews, so basically blind besides seeing trailers.


- It still suffers from a lot of the same pacing and editing issues, that BvS: DoJ, MoS, and Green Lantern did. 


- The pacing of this movie is just horrendous. The first 15 minutes felt like shoddy youtube trailers for some of the characters.


- The structure is a huge mess, and unacceptable for a Blockbuster.


- There were a ton of Flashbacks and almost every time it ruined the flow of the movie.


- The writing was terrible. There was a lot of telling instead of showing, and there was basically no plot, it ended with an anti-climactic resolution.


- In my Opinion the songs were tacked on in the movie. They ultimately feels out of place.


- The action scenes were uninspired, unengaging and repetitive. Which is true disappointment, I hated BvS, but one thing I can say I absolutely loved in that movie was the Batman saving Martha sequence, if Batman didn't murder a bunch of the people in there, it could easily be my favorite solo hero fight moment.


- The villains in this movie were laughably terrible. Compared to villains in this movie Malekith look likes Mark Hamill's Joker.


- It's really disappointing how this movie turned out because Viola Davis is Amanda ""The Wall"" Waller. She was easily my favorite character in the movie. I enjoyed Margot Robbie has Harley Quinn, and mostly enjoyed will smith as deadshot, although in my opinion Michael Rowe is still the better deadshot, I enjoyed those characters more probably because they had so much more screen time. Everyone else was either medicare or garbage, since they were all severely underdeveloped. The Joker was a huge disappointment.


My final rating of the movie is a 4 / 10, and if you absolutely want to see it because it is set in the DCEU wait till you  can rent it. But if you don't care about the DCEU and still want to see a Suicide Squad movie, I would recommend watching Batman: Assault on Arkham instead.

Deadshot, Harley, Waller and Diablo were all fucking great!  Enchantress was cool in every scene where she isn't dancing stupidly in fron of that lightbeam with that shit voice. Croc and Katana felt underused. 

Joker was unimpressive, I really want to see how he is when Affleck directs him. You could tell his scenes were cut to pieces and I think it hurt the movie.

On its own, I would give it a solid B. The plot was a mess and they needed someone to tighten up the dialogue, but Margot Robbie and Will Smith carried this movie effectively enough that I didn't mind.

d66q48t,"I saw the movie on Thursday, and I enjoyed it.  Boomerang got less screentime/development than I expected (I was under the impression that he was a major Suicide Squad member in the comics), but Jai Courtney was entertaining, which was a sentence I never thought I would say or type.

Slipknot and El Diablo were just about what I expected, but Killer Croc actually had some entertaining moments and some good bits of character development over the course of the movie, which was more than I thought we would get out of him.

Amanda Waller, Deadshot, and Harley were all done well, and even though the Joker didn't get much screentime, (which I didn't mind; he's not the main focus, and he's mainly there for Harley's backstory and throwing a monkey wrench into Waller's plans) he seemed closer to the comic version than I thought he would be.

The soundtrack was amazing, in my opinion, and while the sheer number of flashbacks in the opening might have been a bit much, it made sense - none of these characters are exactly well-known, so it helps to introduce the audience to them in some form, and there were some good bits of humour and world-building in the character profiles.

I didn't really see any problems with the pacing; the story was straightforward.  My only problem with the movie was the villain.  She was particularly creepy in the final battle, but her plan (build ""a machine"" to destroy civilization) was vague at best and her dancing in the climax was just weird.

I didn't know much about half of the characters or so going into this movie, but it was still entertaining and easy to follow.  I feel like the criticism were really overblown - while it's not a masterpiece, it's certainly not anywhere near as bad as the critics are making it out to be.",4w86a7

That said, in no way do I buy that THIS Joker had anything to do with the death of a Robin nor can I grasp why Batman would let this Joker just run around unchecked. It makes no sense. If Bruce can get a sit-down with Waller and owns the company that makes Task Force X tech, why is Joker just doing business as usual? This was not a crazy deranged killer Joker, this was just a drug dealing mob boss Joker. Harley seemed more unhinged then he. 


 In same vein, I did not like Batman getting into a fight with an assassin in an alley with a kid there. Geez Bats, isn't that how you snapped? Loved the moment with the Flash. Kinda wish BvS had zero Flash in it. This is enough of a Flash reveal. 

I loved Amanda Waller. Pitch perfect where it needed to be and Will as Deadshot really helped that alot. I didn't like the moment with her shooting her men in front of Rick Flagg. Rick Flagg seemed very GI Joe/Capt America; why would he support a woman who casually murders her own men?

The plot was stupid but good. The plot just happens. Now when it gets going its fine, but the start is insane. So she just so happens to talk in her sleep now? Nonsense. And why did Enchantress ever give up control to June in first place? Once it gets going its a fine plot if overwrought. I know everyone wants high-stakes but world ending stakes filled with Superheros doesn't work. Why does Flash do nothing? Why does Batman do nothing? They need to find some balancing with this. This isn't like Thor the Dark World where the last scene happens in span of hours. The Sun rose and Set on Midway like 4 times. Why would the other powered people stay away? Otherwise I liked it. Everyone had a moment.

If anyone at DC is listening, I would do a string is smaller scale, smaller budget Task Force X movies with one or two where they do things to get time off sentence. Imagine a buddy-action-rescue movie with Flagg and Deadshot, maybe throw Boomerang in there. Then maybe just a straight up Caper-Comedy with Boomerang. After Wonder Woman, lets do a Harley Katana and Waller go to Themyscria for some reason.

If not for BvS this movie would probably get more love. DC needs to lower the stakes in their movies. They want every movie to be about this world changing event and that just doesn't work. By the time things get to national news, it should be over with. We can't have Joker going on a tear and Batman just not giving a shit. You can't have Flash running about and just not giving a damn that a city is being obliterated by magic. 
Lastly, why isn't Killer Croc a main Aquaman villian? ",4w86a7

My Thoughts on Suicide Squad (Spoiler Free)

Wow! I initially had lowered my expectations after reviews poured in for Suicide Squad. I saw it after work tonight and to my surprise, it was the best thing DC has done since Watchmen and the Dark Knight. The characters are incredible and fleshed out without being too complicated. The story and plot is layered, yet focused on a single goal for the characters. Motivations of each character is extremely clear and the humor hits well most of the time. DC has finally realized how a Cinematic Universe is supposed to feel. BVS felt like a side-tracked sequel to Man of Steel, but this film feels much different. Leaving the direction in the hands of David Ayer was the best move for DC. He is well known for doing ensembles (Fury), and balancing each member of the cast well with each other. The soundtrack is phenomenal as well, maybe even outdoing Guardians of the Galaxy, as well as stealing from it.

The only cons I can think of are that of the Joker and Slipknot. Minor, obvious spoilers Slipknot is introduced late in the first act and acts as easy cannon fodder within the next five minutes, and that is all he does. Jared Leto’s Joker on the other hand left a sour taste in my mouth. I was kind of annoyed when ever he was onscreen. He tries too hard to be crazy and different. He acts as a punk romancer. Not really the Joker, but it fits in with the plot of this movie. I have no clue where they can go from here with him, but from what I saw I won’t be anticipating it.

Overall, Suicide Squad reaches an 8 out of 10 for me. Great.

P.S. Stay for the Mid-Credit sequence",4w86a7
d653aqw,"I was really excited for this and I have to admit, this is one of the worst movies I've seen this year. Aside from the performances, I can't think of anything positive to say about it. The story and villain were awful. Besides Deadshot and Harley, the rest of the squad felt very underdeveloped. Editing and pacing were complete shit. You could tell they cut a ton of stuff and had to tone stuff down for the Pg-13 rating. I thought Jared Leto honestly sucked as The Joker and served no purpose at all other than for marketing. The most shocking thing to me was how poor the action scenes were. David Ayer's movies normally have really good action scenes, but they were just so dull and generic here. 

And don't even get me started on the last 30 minutes...",4w86a7
d65ccxl,I actually enjoyed the Joker. I feel if they didn't cut a majority of his scenes it would've been even better. I think this was not his time to shine but in the standalone Batman movie he will blow everyone away.,4w86a7
d65cfzf,"IMHO, not as bad as the critics are bashing it, it definitely better than fantastic four

d66ir8k,When going to see this movie I though it has a score lower than BvS and I thought that was the worst movie of the year. The trailers look fun I think I could get some enjoyment out of this. I thought my expectations are so low this movie can only be good in comparison no way this movie can be as bad as the reviews. Then as the movie was slowly declining in quality they get to the part when they legit just talk to the camera explaining to me who each characters is and there backstory like I am a five year old for 20 minutes. I realize they hit rock bottom. Then a photo shows up of the character with a list of all their info listed on the screen like a snap chat trailer. I then realize this is one of the worst things I have seen in a movie. As the movie continues I start realize this is worse than BvS. I sit through the rest of the movie trying to figure out how this happened I even sat through what ever that shit was at the end with will smith screaming into the camera in slow motion for 5 minutes I even sat through half the credits to see if the after credit scene could redeem anything. I sat there not sure if I saw the right movie if I saw a movie at all. I honestly still think someone is going to run out and tell me it was all just a prank.  ,4w86a7

d6dhq7w,"As a huge fan of the comics and the characters, I absolutely loved the film. The vast majority of the performances were spot on, the action and pacing kept the momentum of the movie exhilarating, and unlike many, I actually really dug the limited screen time for Batman and The Joker.

All that said, I honestly only have three complaints with the film that brought down my overall enjoyment of it.

1. At no point did I feel any sort of empathy for the forced Flagg/Enchantress romance, or that entire sub-plot as a whole, which sucks, because that was a crucial fucking sub-plot! Kinneman and Delevigne were just awful....which leads me into problem number two.....

2. At no point did I believe the Enchantress as a viable threat. Perhaps it was due to Delevigne's performance, or just the cardboard cut-out villain archetype they used that far too many Marvel movies of late have also fallen in to, but regardless, as a villain, she was completely forgettable. And as to her whole enchanted army, magical weapon of mass destruction, motivation....well..that leads me into problem number 3....

3. At no point did I feel like the movie gave weight to the loss of innocent lives. Even BvS and Man of Steel, for all the hate they get, took great effort in showing ""look, real people are being caught in all this horrible shit, super villains suck!""
Yet, in Suicide Squad, there was one throwaway line about the enchanted army being comprised of real people, and how Task Force X and the military are just mowing them down with impunity, and there was NO mention of how the ships and military installations that Enchantress destroyed contained human life.

""It was just ""oh no, a billion dollar thing just got destroyed! That place was a secret!""

Genuinely though, I really, really liked the movie . Those few points just irked me.",4w86a7
d66oyrp,"I've commented on this film twice on r/movies since watching it earlier this evening at my local cinema. According to the masses unless you state it's complete shit and the worst movie ever made your guaranteed to get down voted. Seriously read the comments, even stating the movie was ""meh"" is unacceptable.

As such fuck the r/movies majority. I liked the film and I know I will get down voted for saying as much but it's cool. I'll start a ""Suicide Squad sucks!!!"" topic tomorrow. Instant acceptance.",4w86a7
d68jyea,"Awful piece of garbage movie. The critics are right, and there's no reason you should go and watch this film. It has nothing special to it, doesn't make sense, and doesn't have anything to distinguish itself as an action movie. 

The story contains many plots that don't even make sense, whether it's alone or between them. I feel like the whole plot fails to give a meaning to the heros' actions, you never feel like there's an ongoing stake or any real motive to their actions. 
One of the villains (the Joker, or Mister J.) dies but miraculously reappears at the last minute without any explanation...What the heck? What's the point?


Was bored during the entire movie and didn't laugh at any of the 'jokes', which half of them resolve around Harley Quinn playing crazy over and over, which I found quite exasperating. 
The 'Squad'  is composed of 6 baddies, but only 3 of them will be relevant, we hardly see the others and one if them isn't even introduced I think.
They are all supposed to have special powers, but the one with the most on-screen time,  Harley Quinn, doesn't have anything special. She's just there to play the 'sexy crazy and cute girl' but only manages to get more and more annoying. 

The movie brings absolutely nothing to you. The only moment it made me feel any emotions was during some of the father-daughter relationship scenes between Will Smith's Deadshit and his daughter. But still, this wasn't even relevant to the plot. 

I'd like to know what others enjoyed about it, because there isn't one part of the movie I appreciated. Maybe if you're a geek and are already familiar with Gotham City's characters? I don't know. 

Honestly the worst movie I've seen this year so far.

d67n5k5,"Saw it last night, really really don't understand why the critics are going in on it. I'm not really a 'fan' of comic book films, altho there are exceptions. The whole marvel universe is way too happy happy flag waving for me. Same could be said of the superman films. 


The film was pretty close to what i expected tho. Popcorn. An enteraining action movie, simple. I thought jared leto was fine as the joker, considering its an impossible job following heath ledgers version. Plenty of cheesy jokes and action scenes, but again, as expected of this genre. 

The only problem i had with it was how dark everything was. Every scene looked like it was put through some filter to make it darker. 


Not sure what movie critics expect from this genre? Its equally as good and as terrible as 90% of all the other comic book adaptions. ",4w86a7
d651683,"I was really scared bc of the reviews. I usually don't listen to them but BvS was kinda boring for me and the reviews kinda nailed it. So glad it was great. It was way better than some Marvel movies and can gladly say it was better than Age of Ultron. The origin stories of each character were short and precise. The main villain felt great and even the fast pace made sense as everything happened so fast that the real heroes didn't get a chance to act. It didn't drag out. I liked how the Joker wasn't an abusive character and even though Harley looks sexy, you forget about it after 10 seconds cause she's that good. 

Only negatives are how they didn't show Boomerangs doucheness, they should had made him laugh when he discovers the bombs are actually true and it felt too Will Smith centric with his pose shots but besides that I enjoyed it . A lot. I had fun and it even make me care about Enchantress and Diablo and probably going to look them up now.",4w86a7
d65b8ht,"Loved it

Just a great action movie, i can kinda see what some didnt like but most of the complaints seem to be about characters but i thought they did a great job with harleys, deadshot and diablo backstory.

Hate all you want gonna go see it another 3 times at least 😁",4w86a7
d68j4sp,"I did not think this was the worst movie ever made, like many people do. There's no doubt that it has flaws. So I feel the same way I did about BvS.

Jared Leto is a worthy successor to Heath Ledger as The Joker, even if he wasn't in there as much, and I can't wait to see him in future features going up against Affleck's Batman. Speaking of Affleck's Batman, I also enjoyed his cameo and the Flash's, as their appearances tie them into this universe. Smith, Leto, Robbie, and Davis all gave great performances.The guy who played Flagg was a bit annoying. The guy who played Boomerang wasn't as much, which surprised me because I'm irritated by the actor.

Now, the flaws. The soundtrack was cliched, reminding me a lot of Snyder's WATCHMEN, and it kind of did seem like a movie-long music video as one post here already pointed out. Also, Diablo (who was also played well by the actor) was corny, with that line about how the Suicide Squad was now his family. And I admit, I was laughing at Delevingne's strange belly dance--what dafuq was that about? And I must point out that I wasn't seeing much of anything that wasn't in the trailer. And the unnecessary title cards. Midway City (which looks exactly like Gotham or Metropolis), yes. The Pentagon in Washington, DC? No. It's one of the most recognizable places on earth. I criticized XMEN: FIRST CLASS for the same nonsense.

All in all, not a piece of ****, but definitely some problems. I my opinion, Disney/Marvel puts out this kind of schlock with THE AVENGERS, THOR, and IRON MAN, so why is DC/WB getting so much hate? I think that SUICIDE SQUAD, with all it's problems, is better than anything Disney/Marvel is doing. So if the critics love those pieces of garbage? Why so much hate for SS?",4w86a7
d64x1zk,"A fun watch, but it looks like another BvS, I'm waiting for an extended edition. Some suggestions are

* Remove Boomerang:  The guy is so forced it's funny.  You can find another way to show us the SUPER COOL FLASH. 

* Remove Enchantress:  Her, her brother, and her romance story are just so bad.  Really, every time it cut to them, I wanted to go back to ANYTHING else.

* More Diablo:  He isn't dead, and if he is, bring him back.  I like him, and that's coming from someone who hasn't seen any of the source material.

* Make us care about SlipKnot:  They use him as an example early on, but that might have a more impactful meaning if they set him up like the other members of the Squad.

* Remove Katana:  Really?  She is just a flashback and a blade.  Absolutely no reason for her.  Seems like an interesting character, but deserves her own movie.

* Remove the Joker: He's cool and all, but we really don't have a chance to understand him.  If anyone came in without knowing the Joker, he would feel like an extended cameo.  That shouldn't be the case.  A Stand-Alone Batman movie that builds him as a character would work amazingly, since we would already know who this green haired dude who appears every 15 minutes for 3 minutes.

* More Deadshot and Harley Quinn:  Harley Quinn was well acted.  Margot really fit the character and made me want more.  The same with ~~Will Smith~~ Deadshot.  Sure, he isnt really acting like ~~Will Smith~~ Deadshot, but I grew to like him, and a whole new movie with the both as leads would be amazing.

In Final Verdict, the movie was cool but suffered from pacing, a bad villain, and far too many characters.

ALL REPLIES ARE WELCOME, I AM OPEN TO DISCUSSION, AND CORRECT ANYTHING YOU THINK IS WRONG!!!

EDIT: After reading /u/svelterwolf 's comment, I must agree.  In most canon,  Joker doesn't *really* care about her, but in this one he **seems** like he does.  He tries really hard to bring her back, but in the first place its him leaving her to drown that got her captured in the first place.",4w86a7
d67ulhq,"Just seen it last night after reading all the bad reviews.  I actually liked it, it's no where near as bad as these critics are making it out to be.  I'd watch it again. Plot was a little thin and not a great villain but overall my theatre enjoyed it.

He was actually very much like Deadshot in Assault on Arkham, and his scene shooting the creatures on top of the car was hands down the best action scene in the movie, and I really wish we had more of those. WB also -being a reactionary studio- removed his ""Let's go save the world"" line that people were complaining about in the first trailer. They also made the city evacuation too obvious so people don't complain about devastation, and just like it was in BvS, pointing it out was too distracting. Margot Robbie was an excellent casting choice for Harley; absolutely loved her and she was never ""too much"" in her portrayal. The elevator scene was DEFINITELY heavily edited and I can't help but think it should have been longer. I can't wait to see her in more Batman movies moving forward.

The Joker... was okay. I would have preferred less ""gnarling"" animal sounds which he seemed to use when he had no lines... But most importantly, he had a ""presence"" to him, and his scene jumping after Harley was great. He made people around him uncomfortable and made the discomfort believable, and that's really what you want from the character. I think with him, Harley and Batman, the solo Batfleck movie should be a sure-win, even more than the JL movie. (Although the scene where Batman captures Deadshot was super lazy and not convincing)

There were however many SILLY and ABSURD issues that almost ruined the movie for me, even for a comicbook movie. The super Samsung phone that seems to survive everything, even when she was captured and hung semi-unconscious by Enchantress... Phone is still on with the 'killer app' on it. She's walking right next to them with the phone in her hand, as if she couldn't be taken out by any one of them before she knows what happened. In Assault on Arkham, she was away from the scene and it made the threat of killing them more plausible.

Enchantress is my biggest gripe with the movie. Her movement was super silly and people were giggling about it whenever it happened. Why was she engaging in a physical fight with them when she could just end it all with her mind (which she eventually did). Cara was ok for the other persona, and exceeded my expectations, but as the Enchantress, nope. Super cartoony in a bad way.

Katana was absolutely wasted in this movie, and should have been edited out, and it wouldn't have changed anything except have one less of a distraction.

It was enjoyable at least, and I gotta say I want to see it again more than I ever wanted to see BvS again.

d650no8,"The movie had great characters, a great visual feel, but fell on its face when it came to the conflict/plotline. Really interesting fun characters had to wade through generic henchman to get to a center location to stop a villain far to powerful for them from destroying the world for vaguely defined reasons.

 It is to the credit of the characters that they were able to make such a profoundly stale plotline entertaining to watch, but there is so much lost potential here. If they had a compelling villain and a surprising complex plot with character motivations that made sense, it could have bested Civil War. But instead they went for a filler mission in a video game plot line. 

Overall, Will Smith and Margot Robbie were great, Jared Leto's Joker didn't impress individually but his chemistry with Harley was perfect. 

A Batman film where Ben Affleck's seriousness is pitted against Joker and Harley's bizarre romance could be amazing, but DC seems to keep making shit out of great ideas so who knows.

To put in more into perspective, I'm a huge fan of Nolan's Batman movies, but didn't think this was even close to something like that. It was fun and I didn't hate it, but it didn't leave me with anything where I was like...""Wow."" It was more of the same you'd find in any super hero movie. Whereas I saw this with some friends who are big fans of the Transformers movies, and they liked it a lot. 

I really did enjoy Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, and I think whenever she was on screen the movie was just better. Will Smith did a pretty good job as well, I just don't think the script did any of these characters any favors. The Lizard-guy shouldn't have ever said a word because every time he opened his mouth it was cringe-worthy, and I have no clue why they thought a guy with a boomerang and a guy who could climb buildings would be of any use in this fight. Actually, I don't know why they thought Harley Quinn would even be good in this fight. Am I missing something or is she some crazy skilled assassin?

I don't like Cara Delevingne as an actress really at all, but my goodness was the Enchantress a bad villian. (SPOILER) When she's standing on that stage at the end with the terrible CGI and she's just kinda waving her arms in the air it was hard to watch. Speaking of hard to watch, Jared Leto's Joker was one of my least favorite Jokers I've seen yet. I get it that he wants to be 'edgy' and 'raw' or whatever he's trying to do, but it just seemed like too much. I actually found myself not enjoying the scenes he was in, as he was just uncomfortable to watch for me. Comparing this to Ledger's Joker when I couldn't wait for him to pop on screen, this is not a great direction in my opinion. The movie just seemed to hop around and try to scram in a bunch of out of place details without focusing on building an actual plot or drawing us further into these characters. ",4w86a7

However, Deadshot decides to jump on a car, take two pistols instead of a rifle, and single handedly holds them off? Why wasn't he holding them off before?

d674il4,"There were a lot of problems with this movie, and most of them seemed to be down to editing. I usually don't notice a bad soundtrack but so many music choices seemed completely out of place, it made me wonder if the director had that music in mind when he shot it. For example there's a scene where Harley is in a lift alone and monsters start breaking in to attack her, you'd expect dramatic action music right? Wrong, instead we get chart pop music which doesn't suit the scene at all. 

The thing that disappointed me most though was how poor the action was. Whoever edited it seemed to adopt the 'make a cut every 2 seconds to look frantic' approach and it made it really hard to tell what was going on. The worst offender was Croc's underwater scene, something was clearly going on to complicate the plan but I had no idea what it was, there was just a lot of shots of floundering around. The fight scenes didn't fare much better though, it felt like there was a lot of choreography done but the editor switched angles so often it was impossible to appreciate it, bad guys exploded seemingly at random with me having no idea how they got taken down, occasionally a good shot got in but they were few and far between. 

That's not to say better editing would save the movie, I had a lot of problems with the storyline (I haven't read the comics but I get the feeling the movie made them much more heroic than they should have been), but it would at least have been better than what we got. ",4w86a7

Then at the end Joker is gone and Harley Quinn winds up in the super-prison with the rest and then joins the team. 

The sequel would have the Temptress betrayal plot of this one. Movie 1 would have shown the relationship between Flag and Temptress develop and then the betrayal in the 2nd movie would have been much more pronounced.

She questions him some more about how many he knows of and then the FBI bust in and take him away to Arkhym.
Waller is left with a raged look on her face.

Harley Quinn – Volunteered because she knows joker is there.
Dead Shot – To take out guards from across island while killer croc is infiltrating
Killer Croc – Arkhym in on an island that is monitored. Would swim under water to island. (think the movie “The rock” with Nicholas cage)
Diablo – melt the door in the asylum
Boomerang – Comedic relief Close quarter combat while in Arkhym. Silent take down because arkhym has percussion sensors so Deadshot can not use a silencer.
Slipknot- to die from trying to escape
Flag - Leader

Harley is playing along, but trying to find joker.
They locate Luthor and Harley starts talking.
Joker who is still in the shadows and all you can see is his eyes. All of a sudden you can see his smile and laugh that echoes through the halls.
Harley takes rick flag with her gun and tells him to blow el diablos head if he does not let Mr. J out.
El diablo does this setting off the alarms and sprinkler system.
Enters joker
He tries to take Harley but she explains the neck bomb he fleas and says he will come for her.
Fire extinguishers and alarms are going off, so El diablo cannot use his powers.
Rick flag pulls out the back up “incase stuff hit the fan” plan, and places a large thing of C4 on the Door busting Luthor out.
On their way back to the boat, Dead shot is laying down awesome fire. And so is El diablo lol. Captain boomerang is boomeranging people and Harley is hitting people with her bat and killer croc is just a monster.
Back at Argus
Threaten Harley, but think she is the only way of getting the joker back.

d6clrux,"The characters and acting was well done and enjoyable, the music was good and there was enough laughs, but the writing and story just brings the whole thing down. The pacing was also really poor and the motivations for most of the characters felt unexplored for the most part. Also, the villain is never really established well, and just kind of appears, but at the same time feels too large in scope. Enchantress seems like someone Superman would have dealt with while the Suicide Squad seems much smaller in scope. They should have chosen a villain who doesn't leave you saying ""Well where's Wonder Woman and Flash?"". They tried to make her a global threat but none of it worked. I didn't really care for the Joker either. He seemed like the worse parts of Nicholson's and Ledger's put together; he didn't excel really as a gangster or a psycopath. I did really enjoy Will Smith though, as well as Margot Robbie both of them were great in their roles and line delivery for the most part.",4w86a7

1. What does Killer Croc say to Rick Flag through the bars of his cell the first time they meet.  (I can't understand Croc.)

2. What does Rick Flag say to Deadshot after Amanda Waller murders all those FBI agents?  I couldn't hear it either time.  I think he says something about getting used to the moral ambiguity of working for Waller but he says in a more pithy manner than that.

3. At the beginning when Harley Quinn's profile appears on the screen as graffiti, is the very last item written there that she killed Robin?


I can't wait to watch this again with closed captions and the ability to pause.

I liked this movie but I have to admit that the central plot hole is even more glaring on the second-go-round.  The White House tells Waller to activate her team to deal with the supernatural threat and she ignores that order and diverts the team with the sole mission of rescuing HER.  What if they had succeeded the first time around?  What if her helicopter had not been shot down?  Would Rick have just taken the Squad back to Louisiana and left the witch possessing his girlfriend behind to get on with building her world-destroying machine?  That makes no sense so I'm going to fan-wank that Waller's promise to send a second copter to rescue the Squad was a lie.  As soon as she was safe she was going to order Flag & the Squad to go after Enchantress.  Otherwise, the earth is screwed.

Also some have complained that Deadshot's Enchantress-induced fantasy was to kill Batman, which makes him a pretty cold dude but I think that's a misinterpretation.  I don't think he cares if Batman lives or dies -- what he regrets is his having been separated from his daughter and if he had killed Batman that night, that would not have happened.  So I think his fantasy (dead Batman) is just an awkward way of saying he wished to be with his daughter in the same way that Harley secretly longed for domestic bliss with the Joker.

I'll be the first to say, I really liked BvS, and I had moderate expectations for this. It's a muddled, disjointed, jarring,ugly mess.

First half of the movie is bad set-up, with distracting and badly chosen music. The Joker was awful and made me embarrassed for Leto. The editing completely destroyed any flow the movie could've had. It was jarring and confusing. 

Enchantress was terrible.  Convenient that her plot for world domination could hold off until the Squad got there to stop her...from her weird stupid jig she was doing.

The plot, or the sad excuse for one, was laughable and made no sense. I was hoping the movie would clarify why these meta-human criminals were absolutely integral to taking down Enchantress, instead we got a half assed vague explanation.

I could follow the basic plot and didn't have a problem with the standard comic villain (that the avengers have battled twice now). 

Fight me. Or downvote. That works too I guess?

Fuck me for liking a thing amiright?!",4w86a7
d66diau,I was pleasantly surprised after seeing a lot of bad reviews. It wasn't bad at all. By all means not a perfect movie but it was entertaining. ,4w86a7
d66hty7,"After waiting for more than a year, here is my mini-review/timeline experience. 

From seeing the first Batman v Superman teaser, it was evident that DC was working on something epic. 
It looked dark and ominous - Batman had returned. 
The Hype Rises! 
Then I hear of Suicide Squad... what's that? 
It must be DC's shot at the Avengers I assumed. 
Then I watched the first teaser... HOLY FRICK it looks awesome! 
""Are you the devil?"" 
""Oh I ain't gona kill ya. I'm just gona hurt ya... really, really BAD."" 
I am so down for Suicide Squad! 
So I decided to do the honourable thing and avoid all further info regarding the film. 
No trailers, no interviews. 
Nothing. 
I will wait to watch it in theatre and that's it - because it looks frikken awesome. 

Okay so fast forward roughly a year and here I am having purchased our tickets to the opening performance. 
The 300 seater theatre was almost packed to the full. 
I had my 3D glasses (I know, I hate 3D too, but it was only showing in 3D at the big theatres and I wanted to be where the crowds were) and we were ready to go baby! 

So on to the actual review. 
Without giving too much away, I will say this: 
It was a fun ride :)
The characters were fantastic. 
El-Diablo homie! - he's chill as hell. 
Harley Quinn and The Joker were great - very well done stylistically. 
Deadshot was straight out bad-ass. 
I loved the character stats, that was a nice touch. 
The colours were frikken awesome!
The only thing I didn't like was the pacing, it felt too rushed. 
They could've made the film 15-20 min longer and focused on more character development. 
The CGI was really well done in my opinion. 
The comedic timing was on point. 
I just wish they were more serious in a certain scene - to let the seriousness of what happens sink in. 

Otherwise I thoroughly enjoyed it. 
Not nearly as bad as the critics are making it out to be, in my opinion. 
I'd give it a 7/10. 

So yea, that's my mini-review. 
I definitely recommend avoiding watching trailers and reading up extensively about films - my experience with Suicide Squad was confirmation for me that it's the best way to watch a movie. The less I know, the better. 

Cheers to all the fans out there and see you all at Justice League next year. 
Love from South Africa :)",4w86a7
d66liwn,"I love that so many people are upset with the portrayal of the Joker. I however was quite happy with Leto's performance, scenes with him and Margot made the film watchable for me. 

Clearly he wasn't fleshed out very well and probably had scenes cut from the theatrical release. Joker has been portrayed as a ""crime boss"" to varying degrees in Batman media. I love this take on the Joker and hope Leto continues the role.",4w86a7

d68asis,"Overall, I thought it was bad to okay, but I was most shocked with how bad Jared Leto was. I didn't get Joker at all. He just felt off and wrong. 

I dunno. Will Smith killed it. Margot Robbie was good but started getting a little tiring. The rest of the people were kinda there, and the story was just boring and odd. 

I had low expectations, and the Joker being so bad really blindsided me. ",4w86a7
d68ydly,"Saw this yesterday, thought it was pretty good! Not sure why reviewers are hating. Not anywhere near as bad as Batman v Superman. Joker was kind of lame but not in it too much so he didn't have a Jesse Eisenberg effect like BvS did.",4w86a7

d64twky,"Just my quick thoughts I wrote down


Likes

Deadshot - probably the only saving grace of the movie. I like will Smith in general, so I could be biased

Diablo - Really liked his character, good back story

Enchantress - I was very intrigued by her

Impartial

Joker - I think I liked the joker, but his scenes could of been left out and used to developed the story more. he didn't get enough screen time to get a good idea about how he plays the role.

Bad

Harley Quinn - She had an accent sometimes and other times she didnt. All of her lines were boring and so was her character.

Final form of the enchantress and her brother were awful. the enchantress looked stupid and both of them were not menacing or intimidating.

The action scenes against the alien like beings were boring. Nothing exciting happened. The intro of the movie has all these cool songs, but during these fight scenes we get a boring score.

I didn't like this movie, it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good either. I thought BvS was decent and I liked Ghostbusters, but this had to be the most disappointing movie I saw all summer. At least it's  better than Daredevil.",4w86a7
d64twlw,"Cara was terrible, everyone else really brought it but the plot was awful. The joker didn't really seem as menacing as I thought he was going to be, however that might be due to lack of screen time. The final act was just so messy. I think the poor reviews are just. Sorry DC fan boys. 

Massive fan of batfleck for me he's the only thing keeping interested in this universe ",4w86a7
d64wm17,"I really hate having to say this, but Suicide Squad is meh. It benefits from solid performances and a cool visual style, which together help prop up an overall great first Act. Unfortunately, it's downhill from there. The middle of the film is still pretty solid, but the final act is bland and cliche, and wears down the goodwill previously built. 

Jared Leto's Joker is okay. I like the take, but I think it's only going to get the chance to spread its wings in a Batman film. 

Joel Kinnaman and Jai Courtney were surprisingly likable in their roles as Rick Flagg and Captain Boomerang. Boomerang in particular is a lot of fun. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like this will be their big break.

Will Smith, Viola Davis, and Margot Robbie are great, but that probably doesn't surprise anyone.

The others don't really get too much to do, with the notable exception of Jay Hernandez as El Diablo. He's pretty great, definitely one of the stronger points of the film. 

The only other thing I have to say is that they spent way too much on licensed songs. Almost all of them are well used, but sometimes less is more. They use like a dozen in the first hour.",4w86a7
d64y1us,"Just saw it, 8/10 imo. I have some questions, but overall the movie was good. I'm actually not mad we don't get much if the Joker. Yeah, more would be good, but I saw enough of him to love his portrayal. Will was great, Margot was great, Joe surprised me, and Cara was solid. And man, Viola killed it as Waller. Most of the quips land, and while it was a little more than I wanted, I liked them. The score was pretty weak imo, the soundtrack was pretty good. You can tell, though, that with different choices and this movie could've been darker, and I wish it were. I did not consider the villain to be weak, but I think the villain wasn't given enough backstory. The cameos were awesome, and I loved the Ostrander Easter egg. I think with some small tweaks in dialogue, and maybe 10 more minutes, this would've been the best movie of the DCEU so far, but for me it's third. Very entertaining, audiences will love this movie

I'm looking at other comments, specifically those who had a lot of negatives, and my advice is if you haven't seen the movie, when you see it stop with your expectations. Just immerse yourself and take in the story. Don't critique the movie while watching it, just experience the movie. That'll make you more likely to enjoy movies in general",4w86a7
d64zejv,"This movie was a blast! I personally feel it was SIGNIFICANTLY better than BvS. It was funny, beautifully shot, and chopped incredibly well. The soundtrack was amazing and really complimented the whole rebel/criminal vibe. 

Will Smith surprised me in bringing a lot more to the character than I expected. But ultimately I think Robbie and Leto (as expected) stole the show. I thought the Harley transformation scene was phenomenally well done. 

I can agree that the story was a tad weak and the villain, a bit stale. But I feel what it lacked in story was greatly made up in pure character development and interaction. BvS was all convoluted story with little care for the characters and thus made it incredibly boring to watch. I think as long as the characters are a blast to watch, I can forgive a 1-dimensional plot.

All around, it's no cinematic extraordinaire that everyone demands a comic book movie to be these days, but it was without a doubt extremely fun and entertaining.",4w86a7
d654we1,"First I have to say I enjoyed the movie. A lot of things bothered me like multiple small explosions saving the day, but the biggest thing I kept asking myself is why Harley Quinn was even there. Did it bug anyone else that she went up against a demi god with a baseball bat? I get that shes not quite a rational thinker, but still... If I were setting up an elite squad of bad-ass people why would I pick the unstable crazy chick with no training? Honestly I don't see myself picking the Boomerang fellow either. Negative aside I absolutely loved the Joker. If Jared Leto gets his own movie I'll drive to my theater and start waiting in line now.",4w86a7

d65g0xq,"I think David Ayer probably had a very different movie until WB got scared after BvS did poorly and decided to chop this thing into oblivion in order to make it more fun (spoiler: it's not fun). The pacing of this movie is such that everything feels rushed an underdeveloped and it's as if they removed transitionary elements in order to shift more focus towards marquee character moments. And even with all this slicing and dicing the movie is still 2.5 hours and you feel every fucking minute of it. I would really be interested in David Ayer's original cut, even though I'm not convinced it, itself was any good either. 

Also, Batman should've been the ""bad"" guy and this movie should have been wayyyyyy scaled down.",4w86a7

d66n2lb,"I liked this movie. I'll admit there were flaws: for the first half of the movie the soundtrack was really obnoxious. I like a good classic oldies rock song or an Eninem song in my movies, but every scene? Way too much and a lot of the choices were on the nose. You're in helicopters so the song sings about the sky. The editing was just bad and inconsistent. I was fine with the exposition dump but even after it they added like two other characters. Feels like Ayer had this nonlinear Tarantino script that Warner Bros carved into flashbacks. Not a great Joker either to be honest.

But as for people saying the movie was confused or incoherent... What? This was marketed as a Dirty Dozen with super villains and that's about what you got. The movie is carried by force of personality as far as I'm concerned. Get a good Harley Quinn and a good Will Smith together along with fine backup performances and it's solid. They told jokes, they had fun, the villains were properly campy for a big budget B-movie like this. No, the movie isn't deep and it's not a masterpiece but audiences should enjoy this.

And it was miles better than BvS. Fuck that movie.",4w86a7
d66suso,"Quick note, if you look at the voting poll you see a lot of 1/10 reviews but after that you see the normal curve of scores peaking around 7/10, which I think is much closer to the actual movie

d66upwk,I thought it was a mess and I'm real surprised since David Ayer who did training day and fury which were 2 real good movies. I feel like this movie could of been good but with the 175 mill budget it was way too stuffed. Jeremy Saulnier who did Green Room and Blue Ruin the last few years which both were done for less the 6 mill. They needed to make it a dark thriller or over the top joke of a movie. Just my meaningless 2 cents,4w86a7
d682s34,"It was... entertaining, it was bad, but entertaining. I really hate Jared Leto's portrayal of the Joker, it was SO stupid. Harley Quinn was just there to make terrible cringe worthy jokes, what would a normal girl with a baseball bat would do against a fucking witch? plus.. Flash and Wonder Woman already exists in this universe, where were they when the GIANT FUCKING LIGHT BEAM WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A CITY? Will Smith was good as ""Will Smith trying to be Deadshot"". Boomerang was meh, but he was entertaining. Killer Croc did NOTHING, Katana.. why is she even in this movie? Don't you see you are taking off scenes from Harley, Deathshot and the Noker? The cholo guy... you barely speak to your fucking team and suddenly they are your family? DC you're trying to hard, cmon. Cara Delavinge.. you're beautiful... but please don't try to act ever again. Soundtrack was cool tho.  ",4w86a7
d68cpm6,"Honestly this is another example of a team movie that needed some setup of the characters individually.  We really should have had a few movies with these guys as main villains with legit reasons for us to hate them.  As other said, they felt more like anti-heroes than anything else.  Too many characters with no real screen time for most of them.  The story was a total wreck.  What was the motivation for assembling this team to begin with?  Their enemy was the main villain she said she could control and she fails at that.  The Flash, Wonder Woman and even Batman exist in this universe so why don't they take advantage of them?  I feel bad for DC because I'd like for them to put out a good cinematic comic universe, but it's not working for them.",4w86a7
d690tbo,"I really thought that the critics were piling on unfairly for this film. I saw it and nope, every bad review was 100% on the nose. What I find funny is that no one review could fit all the shittiness into their review. The plot, character motivations, events, chronology; all of it made no sense. Jared Leto's Joker was so bad that they should come up with a way to say ""Oh the real Joker's dead, this is just some dipshit."" It was aggressively bad. Like he knew there was no chance he'd touch any of the previous actors (Ledger, Nicholson or Hammill) and he just decided to ham it up, but not in a fun way.

That El Diablo reveal comes out of fucking no where. By the time they accomplished their original ""mission"" I had forgotten that, that was their mission; not stopping the world ending machine going on in the middle of the city.

The good thing I can say is that they treated Slipknot with exact amount reverence that the character deserves.",4w86a7
d6aezc4,"Great movie ...  what made it successful is that unlike other films the events cant be expected , so the audience would be sitting with wide eyes waiting to see what would happen up next and if there expectations where there to be or not.
 
Events took there full timescale ..fighting and even romantic ones

more the sense of horror played a great role in remove boredness ..along with some humor touch

and the actors were all good players specially for will smith (Margot Robbie was hot )

and the movie mantained a balance between reality and fantasy .

Best DC movie for now ",4w86a7
d6bexrn,"Hold your hate guys and gals.  This movie is going to generate a TON of spin-off's.  Origin stories for Joker, Harley, Boomerang and Deadshot just to mention a few.  And most likely most of some will get trilogies!  Life is good. ",4w86a7

d64u7kk,I just got out of the movie. There is some pacing and editing problems but nowhere near as bad as BvS. I really enjoyed the character development. The plot was a little bland but regardless I liked this movie more than I should. I thought Will Smith and Margot killed it. Also I may be in the minority but I LOVED Leto's Joker. The critics definitely got it wrong on this movie. ,4w86a7
d64usa3,"I liked it a lot.  Smith,  Leto and Robie absolutely stole the show.  This one makes me excited for Justice League.  Although the midscene credit was kind of a waste I feel since we've already seen footage from JL, and the big reveal that was in BvS. ",4w86a7
d64usnn,"Movie had a lot of heart, you can tell the characters tried their hardest to play their role. Every actor/actress did their own stunt, especially Harley on high heels. Harley Quinn (margot) nailed the role so well, every facial expression, every gesture is perfect. Joker scenes imo are being cut too much, we dont really get to see much joker. Viola Davis nailed amanda waller as a heartless women to the crew. Deadshot (will smith) is actually did a great job, his jokes are funny and he is a badass. Along with the side story with his daughter you really feel for the man. Rick Flag is just meh, not too good , not too bad. Jai Courtney got way too few scenes and i cant understand his accent half of the time but the unicorns and baiting Slipknot into getting shot is funny. Jay Hernandez really steal the show as El Diablo, he talked about how he killed his family and thats why he dont wanna use his power. At the end he has redemption for destroying enchantress's shit. Killer Croc is quite useless throughout the film, crack a few jokes here and there. Katana is badass and we get a little back stroy about how her sword is used to kill her husband and now everyone she kill the sword absorb the souls. Batman only had 3 scenes, the one capturing deadshot, the one saving harley from water and the POST CREDIT scene of him talking to amanda waller about wanting the profile of Enchantress, flash, aquaman and maybe more to form the 2017 justice league film. Johnny Frost plays the piece of shit prison guard head and is quite funny tbh. 

Overall this movie has a long way to go inorder to compare it to Guardian of Galaxy. As a DC fan i have to say GoTG is way better than this one. GoTG is much smoother movie, more cogent and better villain. The villain in this movie is Enchantress but it is pretty weak, as is most DC film. I feel like only Joker can really save DC. The character introduction is pretty interesting but its kinda messy. A lot of scenes from the movie are in the trailers so only the last act of the movie is not seen before. It is not an epic movie as is GoTG but is definitely and very interesting movie and could be great for non-DC fan to get to know the villains of DC. I feel like this movie could be better if it has more new scene and cut out the scenes from the trailer. I understand why the critics give it such a low score as I mentioned above. I was gonna give it a 7 but harley performed really well and I loved Attack on Arkham, so I will give this a 8/10. DC fan got to check it out !",4w86a7
d64utqj,"Definitely not as bad as the reviews and critics have suggested, but also the most mediocre superhero movie to date (post-Ironman era of film).

The movie started strong with interesting intros for each character, and I liked the use of different music to accompany their distinct persona. But the opening goes for way too long and you just want the story to move on, and by about the 40-minute mark there still hasn't been a clear antagonist other than maybe Walker, and you're stuck wondering what the hell is going to start driving the plot?

The main conflict is revealed, and it's pretty terrible to be honest. Enchantress goes AWOL. Of all the things they could have done to make a good suicide squad movie, they had to choose ""Ultimate supernatural baddie threatens world"".

The plot is pathetic and is basically just a Call of Duty/Battlefield campaign: Save the VIP > VIP is saved > VIP is downed during extraction conveniently near the bad guy> Save the VIP and kill bad guy

The cast and characters have a great dynamic and the choreography and ""superhero"" moments are really well done. Will Smith and Margot Robbie are awesome as Deadshot and Harley Quinn, respectively. Smith carries this movie but does so in a way that it never feels like he's the lead character, just one of the team, so huge props to not turning it into a ""Will Smith film"". But on more than one occasion the writing goes to shit, and at least each character is forced to deliver very corny, very out-of-place lines.

In the end I can see great potential for this team to come back and do well, but get rid of David Ayer and whoever the fuck did the editing. Non-stop cuts with no respect for timing and tension. If you're looking for a really solid Ghostbusters 2016 movie, this is it. But don't go in expecting a good DC movie, because it doesn't even feel like it's in the same universe. ",4w86a7
d64uy9m,"Alright here goes... Overall I thought this was a solid movie. It nowhere near deserve the bashing critics gave it. That being said, the plot was total dogshit. So Amanda Waller sends them on a mission to save....Amanda Waller? And from there it's just a game of cat and mouse. There was a lot of cheeses dialog that made me roll my eyes. Some really dumb parts, like the bar scene...like just a cryfest for the characters. Very good action scenes tho. Really like the character intros how they did that. Here's what I thought of each character. 

Joel Kinmamen aka Rick Flag: He can't act for shit and showed it. I can only imagine how awesome this movie was have been if Tom Hardy never dropped out. What a fucking shame. His love story with the entrantress was retarded Idk if that was in the comics or what still stupid.

Will Smif aka Deadshot: I actually thought He did a pretty decent job. Way better than I thought. Only thing was how he got caught and put into bell reve prison... Batman follows him and his daughter and is just like, ""Stop...I got you."" Really dumb way thought him and batman would fight in costume. But other than that not bad.

Margot Robbie aka Harlee Quinn: Again a pretty good performance, as expected She carry a lot of scenes and thought she was pretty funny. Also gave me a boner.

Killer Croc: looked amazing and was really bad ass. Loved the bones of maybe human? In his sewer cell. Though, he sounded like a big dumb idiot and said stupid shit like a caveman...I guess that was expected tho.

Joker: I for one really like Jared letos performance of the joker. He showed signs of an amazing joker. Only problem is that he was barely in the movie. If the rumors are true that they cut out a lot of his scenes (which seemed to be true like they never showed him saying ""i can't wait to show you my toyyyys"" and ""bye bye"" while dropping a smoke bomb, and other shit I can't remember.) that's a fucking shame and fuck WB. Can't wait to see more of his joker has potential...dare I say to be as good as....Ledger.... HERESEY! But he seems really committed and did great.

Captain boomerang: honestly one of my favorite people in the movie. And that FLASH Cameo!!!!! Fucking awesome. I hope he is in future suiicide squad/flash movies. 

El Diablo: did a really good job acting. 

All the other I don't care to write about very meh. I give the movie a solid 7/10. The cgi was very shit and i didn't like the entrantress. He stupid fucking dance and shit was retarded. Was creepy tho when possessed not gonna lie. There was some really good action and the movie was ""fun"" as people are saying. I would see it again.

d64xlst,"An action-comedy about psychopaths, pyromaniacs, a human crocodile and **the Joker**, should have been the type of movie you laugh with and not at. This movie really was the bowl of cereal its poster advertised it to be. Just a low-fat story with chunks of characters floating around in it that the director thought he needed to spoon-feed us the development for by pausing his movie and having bullet point bios flash across the screen any time a ""villain"" was introduced. Joker's freeze-frame bio didn't make the cut though...probably cus he already had it tattooed on him. Another mess from DC that could have been great if it were in competent hands. ",4w86a7

Loves: 
- Harley Quinn, she was perfect. 
- Joker, he may not be Ledgers but he made it his own and I think he needs props for that. Don't think we can fully judge him until we see more of him. 
- Harley/Joker relationship, some scenes made me feel as though I was watching the animated season come to life which was awesome. Also I love that they kept the whole Harley tries to break away from him but keeps going back. 
- Deadshot. Will Smith was awesome.
- Davis. She was great. 

Dislikes: 
- Enchantress. I feel like Cara isn't quite there yet as an actress. Sure she's beautiful and can move well, but I don't think they should have put someone so unseasoned as such a big part. 
- Killer Croc. Not his acting that was great. His voice. Could barely understand him. They needed to tone it down. 
- The editing. Very choppy, had little flow. 
- Slipknot. Why the fuck was he in the film, other than to show us the bombs worked? ",4w86a7

d66r320,"Lots of plot holes and terrible music choices can't destroy what is essentially a good hearted movie with terrific performances from all its leading stars. Look out for an intensely creepy Amanda Waller and an Enchantress who looks to have stepped out from a (far superior) James Wan horror movie. 

Seriously though, what is with the terrible pop music at every turn? Those are fine for trailers but really didn't suit the visuals in a full length feature. Felt like someone had layered them over the movie as an afterthought. At least BvS had extraordinarily good music, competent cinematography and thoughtful dialogue; Suicide Squad looked especially amateurish towards the end in every department.

Also, Amanda Waller knows that Bruce Wayne is the Batfleck, right? That seems to be what she implied at the end.

A solid 7/10, somewhat better than the dank BvS:DoJ.",4w86a7
d66yxsv,"**[SPOILERS (DUH)]**

I was a little... Let down... Slipknot dying was easily predictable. The ending seemed... meh. The HarleyxJoker relationship seems... Meh... I mean, the Joker always liked having Harley around, but in one epsiode of Batman TAS she is stuck in jail and he has auditions. He seemed too caring for Harley. And some of the best scenes we saw in the trailers are missing (half the bar scene) 

One thing I was surprised by was the villain. In the trailers all I could gather was ""mean motherfucker wrecking the train"", but in the end it was Enchantress. I thought she was in the Squad, but no she's killing everybody. Also, another scene that is missing (or I zoned out for a moment) was when Enchantress said ""lets do something fun"".

In the end, I was let down, so I'll pass seeing Wonder Woman unless by miracle ends up being rater highers than 80% by critics. Even then, I'll see the extended DVD release.",4w86a7

There were some flowy aspects in the movie that wasn't paced right, but it wasn't a disaster like Batman vs. Superman.

I think it suffered from not knowing what it was. Was it dark and edgy or was it fun and action packed.

Joker, Harley and Diablo want it to be dark and edgy, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and Killer Croc want it to be fun and action.

I think its damn near impossible for DC to please everyone.  I loved that they didn't spend eternity explaining the origins of the characters like most movies do, but i also think that people who didnt know the characters got lost.  Like Captain Boomerang, who outside of Comic book readers know who he is?

I personally think they made a huge mistake going with enchantress as the Villian.  The supernatural boss didn't work, and i think it would have been a better story with Joker or another DC villian doing terrorist type shit instead of a rehash of the Ghostbusters villian.  Something that would have caused more characters development with the main bad guy doing something that the Squad members would be doing if they were free.

The soundtrack was very well chosen (even spirit in the sky) it was very funny at times especially with Harley Quinn. My only complaints are that it felt very very rushed and the editing was quite weird. It didn't seem to have the charm that the trailers conveyed. But I enjoyed it. 8/10 ",4w86a7
d6cd6kf,"Personally I loved the film! It was a modern day take on the suicide squad. Jared Leto's criminal gangster you don't wanna cross version of the joker was awesome! You can't deny that El Diablo & Deadshot were a couple of badasses... I was most excited to see Harley on the big screen (FINALLY) and she definitely did not disappoint. I will be deeply upset if she doesn't get another film, Joker too. I'd love to see more of him and get a better idea of his character. In a way I would have liked to see more of him, but at the same time this wasn't his movie.

Probably one of the biggest complaints about this movie that I've heard is the lack of ""abuse"" in Harley & Jokers relationship... there is nothing wrong with changing up a story every once in awhile. If you want that story read one of the many graphic novels, go watch the animated series... We don't need the same story in every comic, show, movie, etc..... Didn't care too much for enchantress. Her dance moves definitely put me off, and when she told Rick Flag he doesn't ""have the balls"" 
Back to the positives, there couldn't have been a better cast chosen for this film. My fingers are crossed that we get to see more of Harley, Joker, & Deadshot ",4w86a7

This was a great film ",4w86a7
d66bcn7,"It was almost good, but far from great.  Certainly better than the critics' average would suggest. It seemed like most of the theater (which was packed) enjoyed it more than I did. 

The villains are very underwritten, and the actual story is paper thin; basically after the intros, the squad just has to walk the streets to an objective, get into some fights.  Then they do that again.  

Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, and even Jai Courtney(!) were really good in their roles.  Jared Leto does OK, but he never gets a chance for a memorable monologue like Nicholson or Ledger had.  Kinnamon did well, but I thought he looked too old for Cara Delevign and a bit too stringy to be America's ultimate special ops badass. 

It's a stronger film overall than BvS, but less ambitious.  It's well behind both Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy, which are its closest comparisons.  The use of music makes it clear that it *wants* to be like those movies, but doesn't quite get there. 

There's a late reveal about one character that really needed some more explanation.  It left me scratching my head about what this person was supposed to be. 

",4w86a7
d68ckpc,"Just saw it this morning.

All in all, it felt like a two hour long music video. As if the director was trying to put together a list of ""cool songs"" and have a film playing at the same time. (Especially at the beginning of the film when it switched from Deadshot to Harley)

The editing and camera work wasn't great. I felt like the camera never moved, so it was just still and then jump shots for transitioning. Very jarring. No flow at all.

I think I cared most for Diablo's character moreso than anyone else's. I feel the story of Suicide Squad would do much better as a Netflix series with an A-B story structure that helps build up the villain and their plot while also going more into each of the character's backgrounds. 

ULTIMATELY: I feel the film falls along the early 2000's gritty super anti-hero movies. Good for a rainy Saturday afternoon when there's nothing else to watch on TV. (Van Helsing, Daredevil, Elektra, etc.)

Also felt like I liked Harley better in her flashbacks than in the main present plot.",4w86a7

d64unwu,"I think where this movie failed is that it tried to dance the line between gritty and blockbuster-suspend-disbelief-movie. It just kept having moments of total seriousness followed by cartoony action. i would be fine with both, just stick to one. Don't have Harley Quinn, a skinny girl, beat the shit out of those soldiers like its easy while also trying to fit in Katana's storyline like they tried to do. Like Katana was always trying to be a serious, depressed character driven by the death of her husband, but in the context of the movie she was just ridiculous and silly.",4w86a7
d64uuu7,"I had fun in the theater. That's what's I want when I go see a movie in a movie theater. It was by no means a ground breaking film, and there was definitely some shit I didn't like, but I think the good out weighed the bad. 

I wish Leto had more screen time, I really enjoyed his portrayal of the Joker. Margot was awesome as Harley, she was probably my favorite part of the movie. Will Smith killed it as Deadshot, and I definitely hope he plays a part in future DC movies. I don't think anyone was poorly cast, everyone fit their role great, but besides Harley, Deadshot, and Flag, none of the other Squad members really mattered much. 

There was some laughs, a lot of action, and a few scenes that did a really good job of developing characters. There was some stuff with the editing that seemed kind of off, and the villain was definitely lacking, but I definitely liked this movie better than BvS. ",4w86a7

I can't recall any scenes that stick out as particularly impressive, but there were a number of groan-worthy moments. Like other people have pointed out, it doesn't feel like a cohesive whole. It just feels like a series of scenes. But I loved Waller, Harley and Deadshot, and I think Leto's Joker has potential. It was aight. ",4w86a7
d64v6jk,At least DC is killing it with Rebirth. ,4w86a7
d64vafh,"A lot of parts felt like they said ""we got the license to X song, how can we fit it in a scene?"".

I enjoyed it. Margot Robbie, Jai Courtney, and Will Smith were amazing.

Killer Croc sounded WAY too muffled. Kinda like Bane in TDKR before they fixed his voice. I liked his lines when I could understand them.

Leto was...not The Joker. Kinda unsurprising, but I was really hoping for a shocker like Ledger. IMO they should've cut every Joker scene except for the ending when he breaks out Harley, that would've been really good. Maybe leaving in all the Joker scenes that they cut would've made him better.

Flash cameo was actually really good IMO. It was a proper ""connected"" feel.

Deadshot on the car mowing down the enemies was dope.

Overall, I'd say like a 6-6.5/10. I think I'd actually believe someone if they told me that the Director's Cut could make this better.",4w86a7
d64vbdu,"There is a point in this movie where it suddenly becomes slow and bad. I want to say its around the bar scene but all momentum built came to a screeching halt.

I was talking about it with my fiance and roommate and we feel DC tries to go too high too fast. Instead of a world-ending villain, it would have a been a better start if the Suicide Squad was placed against a villain with a larger base like Bane or, hell, even the Joker. 

A lot of things just didn't make sense in this universe and there is a huge disconnect between the Marvel and DC universe in terms of delivery. I can't quite place my finger on it but it just doesn't entice me as much. ",4w86a7
d64vg8w,"Went to watch it without many expectations. Saw it, liked it, and had a couple chuckles here and then.    
It's not a groundbreaking-larger-than-life movie, but it clearly wasn't a shitty movie either.    
Of course, it could have done with a bit more Joker, and little less Enchantress's CGI overkill.  ",4w86a7
d64vi7s,"I thought it was ... okay. There were definitely some good moments, but there was far too much set-up, and that has to be one of the most drawn-out end-fight scenes I've ever seen. By the time it was over, I didn't care anymore. And for all the build-up, I was disappointed in Leto's Joker: he's far too good an actor and there's so.much.material to work with, he felt under-used. Honestly, the whole thing felt like a bad case of ""too many plot lines crammed into too short a time frame"" to do it real justice. It's not a great movie, but better than the 27% RT currently has it rated.

I really wish Scott Eastwood's character would have been there at the dinner between Amanda and Bruce like security, and then when Amanda tells Bruce he should stop working late nights (or whatever it was), Bruce should have replied with something like ""I'll take that under advisement,"" and then looking to Scott, ""You coming?""

At that point Scott would adopt a totally new personality, revealing himself to be Dick Grayson and either then leaving with Bruce or deciding he'd stick around and watch Amanda's back for the time coming.",4w86a7

I frankly loved Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, and also like Jared Leto's interpretation of the Joker. I hope to see him again in the Batman flick whenever it may show up. I think it's so strange that you had a group of actors who seemed so into this movie but just didn't have a lot of room to play because of a poorly written script.

It was certainly not groundbreaking by any means, but I do think it was a step in the right direction for DC and I'll be interested in seeing how audiences react to it this weekend. ",4w86a7

I was also hoping for more Batman. With all the chaos that Enchantress was causing where was the Batman and Wonderwoman ? At this stage in the DC universe they are assembling the team and expecting threat from outside the earth. They should have been in there when the shit hit the fan.

Flashbacks were sometimes in weird places, the relation between the Joker and Quinn is so important I think they should have added 30 minutes to the movie and showed us more of their backstory and maybe a little bit of Joker Vs Batman. 

All in all good movie. Please don't fuck up Justice League, we are not getting enough on the individual characters and the ""group project"" is rushed. Marvel took its time when it showed us a separate movie about each and every character before The Avengers which gave us a complete background about every member of the team before they assemble.

It seriously felt like it was made by a 10 year old trying to impress his older 15 year old friends by doing wannabe things which he thinks are cool. The only slightly saving grace was Harley Quinn.

The whole first half was jarring and tonally all over the place. Joker shouldn't have been in this movie. He stole the show, but it was during FLASHBACK scenes which should have been small stops on the way to the main story. He fucked with the pacing. The Joker also muddled our main villain plot--with him in the mix, it's hard to fear a witch.

I hope everyone is OK from that car wreck, from the amount of black smoke that I could see from several miles away it was probably a really bad wreck. This set the tone for Suicide Squad. 

This movie had a lot of problems but the action scenes weren't a shaky, confusing mess and they were easy to follow and not headache inducing like Man of Steel or Batman vs Superman.

They should have cut out the entire opening sequence of the movie and eliminated a lot of the flashback scenes. The movie started off super slow because of that and those flashbacks derailed the flow of the movie. This movie was never going to be some narrative masterpiece. It should have focused on providing a fast paced action movie that was enjoyable and fun. They also didn't need Captain Boomerang, he was put in solely to introduce Flash. Yawn.

It's the victim of a lot of bad editing and writing decisions. Jared Leto has that ability to be a good Joker, it's just muddled underneath questionable dialogue, mannerisms, and lack of cohesion with his association with Harley. I thought Harley was great, and Will Smith added just enough of his Fresh Prince charisma to add personality to Deadshot without it coming across as ""Will Smith with big ass guns"". 

Enchantress was a horrible villain, as we know nothing of her motives besides ""take over the world because of machines."" But aside from the nameless henchmen being taken out like Putties from Power Rangers, I was entertained.

I feel that I might either be a sleeper agent from some foreign nation, or maybe someone whose entire existence was orchestrated, maybe by a now ancient cabal of priests and wizards, bred in some messianic pedigree? If, as I suspect, there are others who feel entrusted with this coded cypher which might precipitate the end of history, what do you think is our primary directive? The goal so to speak. I suspect that the El Diablo character symbolized the embrace of capitalism as humanities final stage in its progress towards singular consciousness, that we must all embrace our inherent destructive agency, and realize our role in the consumption of the earth by the Holy conspiracy of human endeavours, the machime.of our salvation, organization, hierarchy, the pyramid being the original blueprint. I propose that we begin burning all organic matter, consuming voraciously the bounty of the land, in order to force humanity through capital driven technological progress, become self sufficient.

d6541aj,"Repost of my thoughts from r/DC_Cinematic:

---

Some of you may know me, I post here quite frequently.

I think Batman V Superman is an amazing film.

I have never felt more confident in that opinion after seeing this movie.

Warner Bros. took what I think in my gut was a good film and completely fucked it. Every time it is serious, and every time a scene is given room to breathe, it feels like there was a good movie there. Every time a scene is over in ten seconds, every time a scene that was clearly much longer clearly has 30 seconds cut out of it, every time another fucking pop song comes on for no fucking reason, it cuts out another piece of your soul.

Devin Faraci is the biggest troll on the planet. He has to be. There is no way anyone can objectively say this is a better movie. I don't care how funny some of the jokes are (there are plenty of funny jokes), this movie in this edit is godawful. Scenes are clearly arranged out of order, every scene is trimmed down to its absolute shortest length, I guarantee at least 15 minutes are cut out of this movie, minimum. It may be as high as 20, 25, or 30 minutes. I'm not kidding.

The Joker is barely in this film. Some people say he is in it for 15 minutes, some say 10. They are being kind to it. He is onscreen in this film I think 5 minutes. Entire scenes are not here. There is no Endgame-esque burnt face scene. I can tell where it was supposed to be (late in the film). It's just missing. It's not there. At all. The scenes with the Joker are cut down as much as they possibly could be. The leaked scene where Harley stops his car and he talks to her for what seems like 2-3 minutes is completely absent from the film.

Batman is onscreen in this film for 2 minutes. Tops. His scene with Deadshot is acted like it was filmed in two days. There is, I'm pretty sure, 99% guaranteed, a stunt double in the costume the entire scene, and they just ADRed Afflecks voice in over top. I'm not 100% sure but I'm pretty darn sure.

I am not kidding. Those of you who know me and have read my posts know I am not some kind of troll who hates the DCEU. I like Man of Steel, I am absolutely LOVE Batman vs. Superman. I hate Suicide Squad.

Maybe there is a cut of this that will come out in 3 months that is good. I hope to God there is.

d65isml,"I thought the movie was decent. 7/10

**My main gripes**

*Plot was kinda weak

*Katana was kind of randomly tacked on and unnecessary for the most part

*Wish Slipknot at least had a cool scene showing off his abilities before being wiped out so quickly

*Killer Croc should have been way bigger, felt like they had the big head cheat on him the whole movie

*Wanted more Captain Boomerang scenes showing him off (mainly due to being a huge fan of the comic character)

*Joker was meh, definitely near the bottom of Joker portrayals 

*Too much emphasis on Deadshot and Harley, I know they are favorites but this is a team film not a Deadshot & Harley Adventures film

**Good Stuff**

*Action was solid

*Any Batman is good Batman

*Deadshot was cool, Harley was cool, Diablo was great with the minimal screen time he was given, best Amanda Waller portrayal I've seen",4w86a7

d66bnxt,I almost cried with diablo and dead shot's back story and the Harley after jokers death. This was a strangely powerful emotional film.,4w86a7
d66bwuv,"Deadshot the Aimbot kicked ass. Joker and Harley sucked. Margot Robbie is not convincing as crazy; hell, my ex is crazier than she was. Nor did she get Harley's deadly whimsical-ness right.

Jared Leto was probably the worst part of the movie. For the Clown Prince of Chaos, he was neither funny or chaotic. His plans were very transparent and predictable. He seems more like a common hollywood movie street thug than the anti-thesis to batman. And if you fail to look like the Joker, at least learn to laugh like one. Jared's laugh sounds like a suffocating goose rather than a maniac clown.

Lastly, the movie suffered from pacing and too much left on the cutting room floor. Two hours and two minutes is too short to introduce a whole gang of b-list villains AND have a good story line. There's no reason why they did not spend an additional 30 minutes of action or character development.

Also Jared Leto was great as the Joker, but he was SO overhyped. He wasn't bad, just had too much hype behind him.

d66t89e,"Movie wasn't terrible unlike many users/critics have claimed, movie wasn't as action packed as the trailers made it seem. I actually enjoyed the movie and would've given it an 8/10 if it had a different ending , ANY ENDING would've been better than that, they could've even had the flash show up and save them in two seconds and have Deadshot make a joke about them ""not calling him in the first place."" 


Having said this ,many people are calling Leto's Joker cringeworthy and I do not disagree, but I also like it. I feel like this is the first joker where you can feel truly uncomfortable watching him on screen, which, while might be too much in some cases, would seem much more in line with how someone who does what he does would act, and the reaction they would get from ""normal"" people. 

Harley Quinn , felt slightly underdeveloped (in comparison to Deadshot) and certain character dynamics (i.e. croc and batman, and boomerang and flash) were underutilized if at all. Diablo got a tragic backstory only to sacrifice himself in the next scene, he should've been given more chances to grow , and frankly that could be said about all of the characters except for will smith's Deadshot , most of them end up right where we found them except with TV and espresso . Whether that was a comment on the US penitentiary system or just a coincidence made by bad writing ,I don't know. 

Overall needed, more joker, a pinch more batman, some less hero-ey stuff from the squad and more bad guy shenanigans and this could've easily over shadowed the other movies of the summer.

I liked the early stuff with Enchantress, but I didn't care for her when she got powered up by her brother.  The Enchantress stuff could've used more polish.  But I loved seeing some fun magic in the DCEU.

And I've seen some people saying there should've been more Joker in this movie.  But he's not a Suicide Squad character.  He should be in Afleck's Batman movie or maybe even headline a solo Joker movie.  If SS gets a sequel, I hope Joker won't be in it.",4w86a7

Under the impression people don't like the new Joker because he seems way too modern and acts like some pilled up rapper. His wardrobe was so on point. The gold blazer? When he handed that brick of money to bribe the guard, I said ""That's gangsta"" and then later in the film Deadshot said it out loud. Joker spraying an AK like an idiot while laughing put a smile on my face. It was just so ridiculous. People complain Joker need trying to save Harley goes against his character...WHAT? Harley is his prize project, his work of art. He rips it up when he hates it, but pulls it closer and hides it when he thinks it's the best. He's constantly wish washy about her, abusing her one minute then defending her the next. That scene in the strip club was awkward and creepy. Want go fuck my girl? Sure! Invites her over smiles at you, laughs a bunch, until you realize this isn't a pretty girl on your lap, it's a serial killer's old lady. Joker is an eccentric, homicidal artist. I liked heath ledger's joker, but he came off as a grungy out of towner terrorist. People thought he was so spontaneous, not realizing he had a huge plan in motion, and lied to everyone the entire movie. That same spark that caught Harley caught some of us.

The crowd in my theater was very lively, they laughed, cheered, and clapped at the end. I think people are thinking there are all of these plot-holes etc. because they aren't catching certain things. The characters are not ""poorly developed"" as people are saying. I will say that this film will probably please comic-book fans more than typical movie-goers and I think that is where the problem is. I see people complaining about the Joker not being the Joker we ""know and love""...that's because the comic book, iconic version of the Joker has never been accurately depicted. Nicholson was the mob type, Ledger was the psycho, and Leto is the clown prince. The ending was not as bad as people are saying, in fact...It left me very excited and wanting more! This film set up and enhanced the DC universe. I can't wait to see where these characters pop up next!

- The Joker and Harley relationship

- Every side character was pitch perfect. Boomerang, Waller, Diablo, Croc, and the rest of the non leads were perfectly handled and casted even if they didn't get enough time to take full advantage of it.

The Bad

- Pacing, story, and a lack of payoff at the end (this movie could've taken a note from Predator)

I thought some of the performances were great, but it feels like a bunch of small scenes got cut for time because there are some weird transitions. Just some of the things I ignored while watching because i don't think they ever have any real explanation:

-why didn't any heroes show up at all? Especially the flash who could have got there in a minute. This is a highly visible incident that has required a major metropolitan city to be evacuated, there's some glowing lights in the sky, and we have already seen that the flash is an active hero when he caught boomerang...but for some reason he isn't around?

-what was the point of joker even trying to save Harley at all? During the leadup to the rooftop scene, deadshot finds out joker is coming, and basically wants to form an alliance, and Harley seems to be on board saying they're friends now. Then she leaves on her own when joker shows up, betraying the whole team including deadshot. First off I didn't get why Rick Flagg didn't just shoot her while she's walking to the chopper when he realized the bomb wasn't working. But then yeah she's getting away, I guess Floyd is fine that she left him behind and misses on purpose. But then the chopper is shot down and they think she's dead...until they get to the ground floor and realize she survived. Why did Harley return after she just intentionally left them behind? How is she not reprimanded by Flagg or later Waller at all? I'm pretty sure a few soldiers died in that attack but Flagg doesn't care. So the team dynamic goes back to being exactly the same as it was before the attempt! I feel like they should have just kept the flashback scenes with joker showing he left her behind in the car, maybe that scene where he is missing her and finds out about Belle reeve, and then the end scene where he comes to save her. 

-when the group finds out the truth about enchantress and Flagg, I don't get why all of them suddenly decide that now the mission is no longer worth it? Like what about the revelation that she was supposed to be a member of the team was so docking to them? Especially for katana, who isn't a criminal and hasn't treated them with any real respect.. Now she also decided to go drink with them? I don't get what made her in particular become disillusioned.",4w86a7

I think this movie is suffering from the ""Marvel Effect"", being that any movie that isn't Marvel that has something similar to Marvel automatically makes it a ripoff or ""trying to be Marvel"".

d68ltrm,"Just saw it. It's everything I want in a fun summer popcorn flick. Fun, interesting characters, humor, a good soundtrack, action out the shnozz, and a plot you can go to the bathroom and still follow.

Pros: 
Lovin' the new joker. Lovin' the new ""insane crime king of Gotham"" they give him. Lovin' the return of henchmen wearing stupid masks. The batman/joker car chase soon makes me hungry for more.

Nailed the relationship between J and Harley. They do love each other, the crazy, demented kids.

Will Smith doing some heavy lifting as a ""cooler head"" pretty-much leader role. With the daughter story, provided just as much gravitas as a summer shoot-em-up needs.

I now have an ancient Mayan witch fetish. So I got that going for me, which is nice.

Viola Davis as a villain you love to hate.

Soundtrack was dope as hell!

DC does art direction way better than Marvel. They do dirty in ways that marvel wouldn't dream of touching.

Cons:

Harley Quinn had one line that bugged me. The voices? Girl, you are the clown Queen of crime, that's a tired old bit that sounds super outdated. 

Conclusion, this movie was designed to be the movie that pre-teen boys are going to argue with their mothers about going to see. It's crammed with all the violence, sex, and mean spirited lack of morals and purpose that reminds me of when I begged my mom to let me go see Kill Bill. And in that respect it succeeds wildly. It is pulp, but it is thick delicious juicy pulp. It honestly makes me worry about Justice League. The bad guys were so much fun to watch that I have trouble imagining how a heroic foil to the team is going to be able to match their sense of fun, and total submission to the sleazy gods of the summer shlockfest.",4w86a7

Is that because they wanted a Nicholson or Ledger performance in 10 minutes? I hate those comparisons. Nicholson and Ledger were the main act in their movies, able to fully dive in to it. How do you think ANYONE could show you what they have to offer in 10 minutes?

I bet there is like a whole 60 min B roll somewhere of Leto trying things out and making what time he had on screen the best he could. 

I remember that fan boys hated Ledger's joker type at first, until they saw his whole screentime and changed their minds. I'm not saying Leto is a better actor, no way. However he is what we have, and what we have is 10 minutes. C'mon people.",4w86a7

This movie had bad pacing and editting, large periods of time where it was sort of boring, and on top of that a TERRIBLE third act. Jesus what the fuck was that? Cringed so much during it.

Suicide Squad could have been fantastic if they had a better villain, someone suitable for such a movie.

d65k8ao,"It is definitely much better than its rating on Rotten Tomatoes and worth going to see but there were still major problems. Number one, it needs to be rated R - bad. It's a team of villains for pete's sake not stuffed animals (LOL if you've seen it)! Number two, and this is the criticism that cuts the deepest, it just wasn't dark enough / they didn't take it nearly far enough. Yeah, ok, some bad guys aren't all bad, that's cool, but a lot of them should still be extremely bad. And cookie cutter fantasy possessed henchmen and ancient mystical forces simply don't provide the environment for bad guys to be bad. You can't brutalize no-longer-human henchmen and nobody feels sorry for ancient mystical forces, at least not without a hell of a lot more character development. If Waller is a sociopath awesome - let her and her team (and the script writers) get away with some more seriously immoral shit. As soon as the bad guys turn into good guys this whole concept starts to lose its appeal and they're already well on the way. This movie was very entertaining, I would call it a must see, but hopefully the next one takes a step in the darker / rated R direction. By all means keep the conflicted stuff like El Diablo not wanting to use his power and Deadshot wanting to be better for his daughter - they can be the good bad guys.

Batfleck kills it yet again in the brief time he's on screen, and while I don't think Leto's joker is as great as most people are claiming it definitely wasn't a rancid take on a legendary character.

d659l8p,"I loved this movie to the point where I was shaking my head, trying to understand the criticisms I'd heard before going in.

&nbsp;

I don't wanna dismiss the critics and say they ""didn't get it"" like with BvS. So I believe that they understand that this wasn't about the story of a mission to save Midway City from the Enchantress. This was supposed to be a character-focused window into the lives and motivations and makeup of the Skwad. Like End Of Watch. If that movie had a story, you never hear anybody talking about it because the point of End Of Watch was just to provide a vehicle for these two cops to bond over. And people loved that.

&nbsp;

So Suicide Squad must've somehow did this wrong. Anybody have any opinions on why this was done wrong? I hear things like ""The editing was bad, they shouldn't have put the flashbacks in the middle of the movie."" But the flashbacks are the story. Enchantress isn't the story. Enchantress is just a mission that the Skwad can bond over and the real story is looking into the lives of the Skwad, or at least the important Skwaddies. Not Killer Croc.

d66jjp2,"I thought it was great, WAY better than the BvS theatrical release. Rotten Tomatoes is fucked. I've seriously lost respect for that site in the last year, it seems it's cool or some sort of hipster critic trend to absolutely shit on films that are really just average to good. Maybe it garners the reviewers more attention? Either way that site is just opinion, not critique.

I've also seen Leto get ripped to shreds in many reviews and have to reiterate my thoughts on his performance and comparisons to Ledger's Joker from another thread.

I view his performance as more of an introduction to the character. It's not like they were going to have Batman's biggest adversary blow his load all over this film when chances are pretty high he will be the main villain in a future Batman film, maybe even JL?

On top of that the other members of the squad will probably get supporting roles at best in future films outside a sequel. If they don't make a sequel this may be the last time we ever see them outside cameos so it makes sense to make the Joker a supporting role, chances are he will be the main villain in another film, and focus on the other members of the team.

In regards to comparing his portrayal to Heath's, as the majority of reviewers and franchise fans have done, I really think it's an unfair expectation for Leto to have ever had the same impact. Firstly he's on screen for 7-8 minutes compared to Heath's 34-35.

Secondly Heath's performance transcended the film. He was the Joker. One of the main factors that contributed to this outside his performance was his anonymity when compared to Leto's fame and history in both film and music. In short Leto is vastly more well known than Heath ever was at the time he played the role. Sure Heath had quite a few films done but outside A Knight's Tale and Brokeback Mountain he was less well known. I remember much of the internet discussion at the time he was first given the role, firstly the surprise at the casting, and also the fact many people had very little idea of who he actually was.

As such he was given a completely blank canvas with many viewers with little to no preconceived expectations. This allowed him to simply transcend the role and truly become the Joker while for many this time round it's always going to be Jared Leto *as* the Joker.

Outside that Heath had a vastly wider gap, 19 years compared to 8, dictating far less relevance or comparison to Nicholson's version and Leto also has less to work with. It's hard to be impactful as the Joker when the guy you really want to mess up who is your nemesis and therefore brings out your true motivations , Bats, has a bit part. They are pretty symbiotic to each other.

My only issue with Leto was the costume. The teeth and tats was just to much for me. It was like they were trying to force his mental instability and psychosis on the audience aesthetically which is just lazy. The Joker is just a dude in a purple suit with make-up and a fucked up face. Not Willy Wonka with tats. His madness should be displayed through his actions and the script, not because he has ""wacky"" tats.",4w86a7
d64u1g6,"I love DC movies and I've been excited for this movie since last year's Comic Con. For me, this movie is very middle of the road. The main cast members and the interactions between them were fantastic. I loved the smaller, quieter moments between characters. Margot as Harley is the best casting for me this year (as of right now no one else really pops into mind). Will Smith really brings his A game and, I never thought I'd say this, there needed to be more Jai Courtney. 

Other than the cast, this really felt like a bland action movie with a lot on the cutting room floor. I want to say that Jared as the Joker was really good, but there just isn't a big enough sample size for me to really commit to that statement. The script is shallow and some of the character arcs just kind of happen. I thought the soundtrack was fine at first, but then it got really distracting the longer it went on. 

Ultimately, it's fun in some parts but really bland and disappointing during most of it. ",4w86a7

d65ea73,"Suicide Squad Spoiler Summary(part 2)
They get to the building, Will goes quickly, stops for a chat. Crazy woman goes up the elevator without her team. Everyone freaks out and goes after her. Oh yeah, she beats up two monster soldiers in there too. Really Fucking Cool Scene. They shoot around in an office, cool cool cool. After clearing all enemies they find out that the ‚man they had to escort‘ was Amanda herself. Everyone is really pissed off but their life is on the line so nothing could be done.

They go up to the roof and call for helicopter. Helicopter doesn’t respond and shoots at them. Turns out Joker had taken over the heli to save crazy woman. They deactivated the explosive in her neck and she goes after Joker even after Will told her not to. She leaps and hangs onto a rope and the heli flies away. Amanda orders Dead shot to shoot her, and he does, but misses on purpose so Cray cray could survive. Amanda sends a missile after the heli, cray cray jumps out and joker and heli crash onto the ground. Amanda is brought away by a heli, and team stands on roof.

Amanda’s heli gets destroyed by tentacles. She gets kidnapped. Team goes down to find cray cray sad sitting on a car. Cray cray follows the team to the heli to help amanda but she was gone. Will finds secret file on the exorcist. Gets pissed off and forces solider boy to tell them everything. Team gives up and goes into the nearest bar for a depressing and lightmooded talk. More background story on how burning man killed his own family. Croc is fucking beautiful man. Exorcists gets her heart back, shit goes down, everyone is still drinking. Solider boy runs in to give Will his daughter’s letters. Solider boy also destroyed his phone which can blow their heads off to show how sorry he is. Will is like, you have my daughter’s letters, I will fucking carry you out of there alive if I must. Cray cray calls everyone a pussy and everyone goes. Croc goes underwater to and the bomb happen. Everyone else goes into the ‚Roman palace battle ground‘. The exorcists tells them to join their side and she will give them what they want. Everyone gets visions, Will gets to kill batman, Cray cray has a family with Joker, solider boy gets to fuck the exorcist human form and burning man has his family again. Burning man realises it is all just visions and wakes everyone up. They have a fight with exorcist bro. kinda fails until burning man becomes super burning man and beats the crap out of enemy. But he loses his power very soon and was held down by exorcist bro. Solider is like, get out burning man, and burning man’s like, you are family, I dun wanna loose another one, just do it!’ Solider boy tells croc to blow up the floor and exorcists bro and burning man die. Sigh.

Moving on, exorcist finishes the spell. Many secret bases are destroyed. She comes down to beat suicide squad. Crocs comes from the ground and joins the fight. After a bit of messing about she is like, these are okay strong and were worth my time, I should totally tell them to serve me’, cray cray says if exorcist can revive her pudding, aka joker, she would join her. Exorcist is like, sure dog, I can do that no problem, just bow down to me and serve me. Cray cray bows down to her, takes the knife on the ground, and slices exorcist’s heart out. This part was painful to watch since it was in super super slow motion. Come on man, dun really need that, you know. Croc threw explosive at the spell area. Will lifts his gun to only be met by a vision of his daughter begging him not to shoot, not to shoot. Will had to ignore her painfully and shot the explosives causing the spell to break. The world has been saved.

Soldier boy tells exorcists to bring out human form but she doesn’t. So he squeezes her heart until she dies. He walks away sadly and she comes back to life. She tears away her exorcist face and smooch time. Still no sex. Man.

Everyone is like, off to forever freedom, I’ll do this and that and then this and that again, then she comes out and everyone is like, what the fuck, how are you still alive? Will wants to see his daughter, croc wants a TV in his cell and Cray cray wants an expresso machine in hers. Everyone gets back into prison. And Will gets to visit his daughter and teaches her all about gun range and everything math and gun related stuff like a good old father.

‚bohemian rhapsody‘ starts playing as it shows their wishes have been fulfilled. Will gets his daughter, Croc a tv and cray cray a coffee machine. Then suddenly explosions and gunshots everywhere and they break cary cry out of prison. A guy removes his mask and revealing that Joker is still alive.

A bunch of credits with a cool song, comes the extras~~~

It turns out that she was taking to Bruce Wayne the whole time about keeping stuff confidential for her and him wanting to know or about these people. Hinting at maybe Justice League stuff. Who knows really. Just know Batman says he has some ‚friends‘. Okay…

d66krp4,"Overall was decent but nothing special or unique. I thought Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Amanda Waller and Diablo were the standout characters. Their arcs were done well and those were the characters that I latched on too. Everyone else you were told to care about in the exposition scenes (Waller in the restaurant) felt flat too me.

The flashbacks some were handled well others were jarring and didn't provide the emotional attachment to some characters like Rick Flagg or Enchantress. The Joker was hardly used though the scenes he was in were good but he was never superficial to the plot. Would have been better he he had a larger presence or be just present in the flashbacks. 

Cameos were done well, liked the mid credit scene but the action was underwhelming especially the 3rd act final battle was horribly filmed.

People complain that this movie is a comic book movie, wtf did you expect? Don't come in expecting to have a life changing epiphany on the scale of the Dark Knight. It's just a fun movie and I personally put it next to Civil War in terms of fun and humor. 

People complain or love the music. Personally I thought it was going to be shit modern day music but surprisingly most of it was appropriate and classic hits.

d68l01l,"11 of us went to go see this movie tonight. 2 of them couldn't form an opinion of it. 2 thought it was meh. 2 thought BvS was better. 1 had watched it a second time and felt it was better the second time around. 4 including me thought the movie was good and did what it was meant to do. 

It introduces the characters without dragged out over exposure. The Enchantress was a weak character to have as the main villain, but I still felt that as a way to introduction of the team it was good enough. This was not supposed to be an over the top type of movie, otherwise what would all future movies build up to? 

Joker... I saw some glimpses of brilliance, which could have been highlighted but didnt not get enough time on screen to do so. The main focus was showing how much him and Harley were a thing, and not so much how crazy the Joker is when hes got the free time to do what he does best. I'm looking forward to seeing him in future movies. Critics are ridiculously wrong on the ratings here. Wasnt an amazing movie, but I felt I got my moneys worth and actually looking forward to a few of these characters in future movies now.",4w86a7

If that's where we are in that point in time how is the Joker around? BvS is supposed to be around TDKR time. In BvS we see Jason Todds suit with Haha on it. TDKR is supposed to be 10 years after that. So why is the SS Joker young and Bruce is older?  Why is he running free?  He was supposed to be catatonic in Arkham until he gets out and then shortly after dies. Am I getting my stories mixed up?

d69ezlv,"Summary: Tom Brand is a major business tycoon, who has distanced himself from his family. In a rush to get a last-minute gift for his daughter's 11th birthday, he goes to a mysterious pet shop and buys a cat. On the way home however, Tom gets in an accident and finds himself trapped inside the cat's body. He is told by the store owner he must reconcile with his family within one week, or be stuck as a cat forever. If that's not enough he's also determined only a secretly convened group of disparate, despicable individuals with next to nothing to lose are humanity's only hope against an unstoppable threat. However, once they realize they weren’t picked to succeed but chosen for their patent culpability when they inevitably fail, will the Suicide Squad resolve to die trying, or decide it’s every man for himself?

Harley had some great scenes but her accent was all over the place.  Some parts she was great, others not so much.
This movie was all over the place.  
Deadshot was pretty solid all the way through though.  
But man I'm really annoyed with the Joker.  They had such potential.  His voice sounds like a mix between Ledger's Joker and Cpt. Jack Sparrow lol.  With his crazed out look they could have done a crazier higher pitched voice instead of mimicking Ledger's voice.  The Joker's character on the whole was just not great.  He left Harley behind after the crash (I liked that), but then was sitting in his room all depressed when she was taken and risked his life to save her.  Their relationship wasn't done well at all.

Will Smith as Deadshot was really just him playing Will Smith (which I didn't even mind). Amanda Waller learned how to handle classified material from Hillary Clinton, Killer Croc looked like shit and had about the same level of depth as a character. Why was Katana even in this movie? Boomerang kinda sucked. Leto's Joker is probably the worst rendition of The Joker put to screen (though that may not be his fault entirely).

d67m086,"This movie was nearly a well done extremely liberal criticism of how the CIA and American Military acted during the buildup to the War on Terror, at least in the first act. Several parallels established in the beginning seem to suggest Ayers had a different, potentially more controversial and probably pretentious, story arc than the obviously quickly put together chaotic and ultimately extremely meta and self deprecating second act. First the preemptive policy (war on terror, suicide squad) in response to a threat following real destruction (Not trying to be inflammatory and state 911 is similar to destruction caused by superman), would spur the creation of the    threat that the policy was attempting to preempt (ISIS, enchantress). Other eggs such as the Cheyneyesque Waller portrayal, and sadistic Guantanamolike prison point to an antiwar subtext, but the chaotic second act doesn't allow Ayers to get there. 

Enchantress as a villain seems forced.  (If the joker and Harley Quinn were made to be the ambiguous bad Guy's the movie would have been better served.) In the first act she is hardly made into someone who was originally supposed to be evil. Instead she is framed as someone who the audience typically feel sorry for, an individual held captive by someone who is holding all the cards. She seems to be a character who only wants respect. This is similar to how ISIS formed from the disorder and abject disarray following the dismantling of Iraq. (People who once had lived free albeit differently were being forced by others with a grip on their livelihood, their hearts.) 

I think Ayers main original takeaway message was to show how the lines between good and bad are often blurred, as most people despite their extreme differences for the most part have similar values. It seems Ayers is consistently referring to certain innate values such as love and of family as motivating factors throughout the movie. His framing of Harley Quinn as wanting a family humanizes her where the formerly unrelatable psycho becomes somewhat human, whilst dehumanizing Waller as an unforgiving and ruthless power hungry careerist willing to do anything to achieve, exemplifies this concept this attempt to blur the lines. Essentially he seems to want to show that people will go suicidal, and blow themselves up for love. 


Throughout the film Deadshot seems to be consistently evolving his conceptions of good and evil. The ending however is where this evolution and ultimately the whole movie falls apart. I think the scene where Deadshot missed hitting Harley Quinn when she escaped with the joker was meant for the end. The ending would've been great if it was a slowed down big dramatic missed shot where Deadshot comes to the realization that the 'villain' really isn't evil, and was just forced by necessity to fight back against her oppressors. Harley Quinn's pistol which has love and hate written on it only makes sense in light of this otherwise there is no point to it. It seems Ayers wanted the gun to revolve from hate to love as Deadshot misses the shot which ends the 'villain's' evil plan. 

(Sorry I didn't elaborate more on my potential parallels mentioned in the premise of this post--it's late and I'm lazy plus I've already spent an embarrassing amount of time on this theory haha--feel free to comment and I'll try and clear of my theory's inconsistencies and holes to the best my ability's. )

We have all these fantastic characters and it felt like they were just there for the sake of ""This is a Suicide Squad movie"" but were going to cram Will Smith down your throat and act like he's the only character we want to hear and see. 

The trailers make it seem like the Joker is going to be a big part of the movie but he's barely envolved and when he is your left scratching your head, he could of just been completely left out.

Also, can someone explain why Deadshot was having such a inner battle at the end to shoot the explosive charge? I felt like that was out of no where. In the end this movie is everywhere with no real character development or direction. Leaving out the deeper artistic stuff the action scenes are very generic and I didn't really see any of the characters special powers shaping the overall battles, I really felt like they could of been any random group of people almost.

For me I am dissapointed with the movie, DC/WB has some serious problems.",4w86a7

You sure you watched the same film?  

Anyway, here's what I thought (I don't care about comics, it's just my opinions from the film only):

Good things about the film IMO:

-Lots of shooting things, action.  I like that stuff.

-The special effects were great.

-Will Smith did a top job as Deadshot.

-You'll all disagree, but Karen Fukuhara is bloddy hot.  More so than Margot Robbie IMO.

-The soundtrack was 10/10

Bad:

-Heaps of the dialogue was in another language.  I'm not sure Katana said anything in English, or the brother.

1. Amanda Waller AKA Gangsta a$$ b**** basically almost destroyed the whole world by fucking with Enchantress to the point of treating her like a slave. Then what does she do? This leads me to problem #2
2. Gangsta a$$ b**** decides to recruit a clown b**** with no powers, Corey Taylor:a man that can climb anything?, a mentally disabled crocodile man, Kyle Reese with a boomerang, Will Smith - whose power is pretty damn cool I must admit: being able to deliver one-liners while murdering Splinter soldiers is pretty amazing, Katana, whose superhero name is so original...I can't even, El DIablo who is literally the coolest fucking superhero ever, and Rick Flag aka White guy #3.

We should really have higher standards about this shit.

ANYWAYS, Viola Davis is real strong obviously.
Margot Robbie does a pretty good job!
Will Smith has his swagger which is nice.

Killer Croc looks absolutely retarded.
The story doesn't exist/changes every ""scene""
Oh! There are no scenes. There are just different locations. Literally nothing happens when we change locations. Just convoluted shit.
Not sure what the actual goal of the SS was supposed to be...since Enchantress didn't go full evil until 20 mins in..and then they focused all their attention on her and forgot what got them together in the first place....? ..idk

anyways, this movie is a steaming pile. Also the suicide squad sucks and as a lot of people are saying - they dont have any cool powers. They just are like pretty average people.

d67he1y,">Performances were good, however it's the writing and plot that are troublesome.


pretty much sums up what this movie was. it was like the comic film version of oscar movies that just showcase actors' talent. 


The Joker didn't even need to be in the film, it's like they just wanted to parallel to the animated short and other renditions of the Squad. While Leto's performance was great for what it was...it didn't feel like Joker to me, good look, good physical acting, but dialogue, growling, and the laugh weren't him. I liked the laugh, but it's not one you can just fit into any context, at least mix it up a little. 

Will Smith...usually I rip hard on him when he goes through character development like Deadshot did, but this time I had to make an exception knowing Deadshot validly does this kind of shit. Loved Will's performance.


Margot Robbie nailed it. only line I didnt like was the voices line. Glad we got such a bomb Harley, although I am confused as to why The Joker/Harley relationship is similar to that of a gangbanger...that likes killing people.  

Jai Courtney...I can't believe I'm saying this, but I wanted more Boomerang in this film, his past performances and Will Smith's tropes were the two biggest things scaring me about the film prior to release and they both surpassed my expectations, if/when The Flash gets a solo film, I want Jai in it, The Flash needs like....3 villains, we already know what Boomerang is all about, Captain Cold and maybe The Trickster would be sweet. 

Jay Hernandez....oh man, what a good thing for him, I dont get the ""family"" line about the squad because they spent one night together, but the rest of his writing was fun to follow, and the Diablo design in the final act....I loved it. I can't remember who's rogue gallery he's in, but I hope we get more in the future. 


Croc...I wanted more Croc, there wasnt enough for me to evaluate his performance, but I loved the look and design, I expected more rage out of him, but I do like that he sorta cracked jokes about himself (Nah...I'm beautiful) 

Viola Davis had exactly what I expected out of Waller, and that's fantastic, cold. While my friend didn't enjoy the end credits scene, I did, so glad they addressed the Batman/Waller rivalry. 

Ike motherfucking Barinholtz, the tone he brought to the film is just what I think we all expected from it. He didn't outshine everybody, but he stood out, and I'm happy that he did.

As far as other performances go, they did solid work with what they were given, Nothing to complain about for performances. I just don't dive in enough to the other characters to know just how ""accurate"" acting was.

As for the movie itself, I liked it as a popcorn movie, if you don't think about the details too much. Otherwise it ruins it.  The characters were good, if a bit shallow. Will Smith and Margot Robbie were solid, and Viola Davis nailed Amanda 'by any means necessary' Waller.  The soundtrack was good, as I grew up with a lot of the music. I'm not sure what D.C. is going for here.  Maybe they need to listen to the comic writers? Marvel is pretty good about including them in the script writing process.

Here, you get to see him as a kingpin managing actual organized crime; and he just happens to be a flamboyant psychopath.

d65hzds,Didn't you hear? She was busy chopping people up right at that moment! She's a good guy so they can just call her in whenever.,4w86a7
d65tm87,Well how else would they contain several homicidal maniacs. Plus her magical sword actually hurt both of the villains.,4w86a7
d6bsvz3,It was very important that we meet her and learn about her husband being killed and having his soul stuck in a sword and that that sword will trap the soul of anyone it kills because of reasons,4w86a7
d68mt8f,Sure thing; the reason why Katana had to be there is because WB wants to rush right into having a solidified cinematic universe.  So they're going to cram in known comic characters into every nook and cranny.  ,4w86a7
d66ao8k,"In a good movie she would have been the heavy backing up Flagg's authority. He needs someone super tough to watch his back against all these psychos and that's her role. But again, that's in a good movie. ",4w86a7

d66fgwf,[deleted],4w86a7
d64wnq7,"Needed an Asian character. Big studio movies now need to cast based on affirmative action and represent all genders, races, and sexual identities, or else the Social Media Police will cause a viral outrage, and the ensuing press destroys your movie. ",4w86a7
d653q0r,"I agree. Making them fight a super powerful villain brings into question why Batman, WW, and the others are not there. They should have created a villain / a problem that suits the characters better.",4w86a7
d652eum,"I thought it was odd that a team designed to take down the next Superman had only 2 metahumans on it. Harley and Deadshot really have no place going head to head with someone as powerful as Enchantress - even Katana was a bit iffy, but at least she had a magic sword.",4w86a7

d65r3he,"That isn't even an issue for me. Their mission, the reason they are sent there is to extract Waller, the woman that can call a Chopper any time she wants needed extraction, even though the entire city somehow managed to find time to evacuate, she who was already on a roof and could have a helicopter there in 5 minutes somehow didn't have time to leave...",4w86a7
d66g6ge,"And that I think ended up being the core problem of the movie. They ended up being an anti evil meta-human task force rather than a group meant to perform morally dubious tasks for the US government.  If they had been assassinating a dictator or something like that the film would have been so much less generic. As is the plot just seemed like another superhero movie plot, nothing special.",4w86a7
d65fwr6,"exactly! this is what I've been saying to all my friends. the movie was essentially a bunch of Hawkeyes vs the Chitauri, they can do well but come on. they should've had an enemy more grounded in reality for them to fight. I guess it makes it more digestible to a PG-13 audience though. this would've been a movie that could've flourished with an R rating. ",4w86a7
d65lpak,"Seriously. Based solely on what they actually did in their respective movies, Enchantress was a way bigger threat than Doomsday.",4w86a7
d66xv5b,"My big beef was that they're up against a cataclysm level threat right from the get go. And suddenly they're ""a family"" after like 15 minutes of meeting each other. I think it would have been effective to have them go out on a few smaller missions first, busting up cartels or something, to establish a rapport with each other and make their allegiance believable.

d653ir6,"She wanted to rule and be worshipped, not annihilate the world. That's why she engaged by hand. She wanted the Squad as zombie members. ",4w86a7
d664qcw,"I imagined the movie being the squad sent on a mission, but the Joker catches wind and fucks it up for them.
",4w86a7
d66gein,"Yeah the movie had no limits on this. They obviously made the mistake of bigger = better. But now the ""bad guys"" in subsequent movies are doomed to be not any more powerful than those 'gods'...... What ever happened to ramping up the bad guys. It was the Squads first fight, they could have easily just fought a terrorist and left out enchantress all together, focussed on the squad instead of the big mess at the end.",4w86a7
d66z0fe,"Agreed. Although I thought it was rather clever that Enchantress was revealed as the villain, the disparity in strength ended up making the final defeat fant4stic level of bullshit.

This film is so polarising for me. There were some points I found clever and others that were stupid. Like, deadshot and Diablo were really good while killer croc kind of just existed and captain boomerang was basically just a running unicorn gag.",4w86a7
d64z8lr,"I was bummed out by that. Enjoyed the movie more than I expected - overall totally decent summer flick with some likable characters. But why put the squad up against a seemingly omnipotent villan from the jump? It was obvious that they were outmatched, so the whole 3rd act I'm just ready for them to pull a rabbit from their hat.",4w86a7
d66evxo,"She seems like she'd be a good antagonist for a Justice League Dark movie.

John Constantine, Zatanna, Swamp Thing, and Etrigan know magic and would probably have been more effective.",4w86a7
d66hy8a,And that battle carrier that was split in half that I hope is mentioned in the sequels or next dcu film. Because a portion of a major city and a battlecarrier was destroyed. Though the enchantress reasoning for not killing them straight up was because she wanted them to join her for some stupid reason even though they just killed her brother. Oh and her minions were civilians and captured soldiers mutated into those things and than they were killed by the suicide squad. batman apparently is cool with helping Wallace cover up her involvement for info on the good metahumans. ,4w86a7
d671csv,And then 5 seconds later she stops and rips all their weapons away. ,4w86a7
d672wjd,Exactly this.  You're going against 1000 year old beings who can destroy helicopters with one arm swing and create giant bolts of lightening and you expect me to believe that a girl with a baseball bat and some dude with a boomerang can do anything?  ,4w86a7
d67410u,indeed whats the point of the JLA if 5 nonpowered folks can handle this ,4w86a7
d675jkr,"I was thinking this the whole time. The strongest scenes showed fun banter and nanoseconds of teamwork between the squad, it would have been really cool to see them go up against a more equal villain so they could show more of that (and less CGI lightning and hula dancing)",4w86a7
d67aymj,"I feel like this is pretty much what is happening in all superhero movies these days. They fight characters that are just way too fucking powerful, but then those characters decide to put themselves in really vulnerable positions rather than use their ridiculous powers to just kill them all inmediately. I'm really not a fan of all these god like villains that keep popping up in these movies now.",4w86a7
d67i76f,Agreed.  I felt like the Diablo guy turning into some huge fire guy was a cop-out for the movie makers.,4w86a7
d67igqp,"I agree, like what is a baseball bat going to do against a god? ",4w86a7
d67ik3s,"Not completely disagreeing with you, but I can see what they were aiming to do. Amanda Waller is a shady ends-justify-means agent who created the very problem she was seeking to prevent. She didn't involve any other agent outside of her control because she wanted it under wraps because she knew it would bury her. It all underscores the need for Batman's vision of a Justice League. Does that make sense?",4w86a7
d67m2d8,Everybody in my theater was confused when she said enough and threw their weapons away. Like what was the point of the fight?,4w86a7

d681c75,Yeah what did expect mr boomerang to do that a normal soldier couldnt in that situation? lol,4w86a7
d683ssd,"Yeah, they needed a Deadpool kind of villain, a villain that could get them closer, or even a villain that is funny, but battling a superpwerful entity which is killing the world without major superheroes being present was weird, it just came as a copy cut villain ",4w86a7

d6a1ty3,[deleted],4w86a7
d6adnpb,You mean someone like.. The Joker? That they advertised the hell out of and implied that he was gonna be the villain in the movie but wasn't,4w86a7
d6bfpmo,"To be fair, the Squad's duty wasn't to fight Enchantress. The only reason why they did was because she had Amanda ""Gangsta"" Waller. ",4w86a7
d6bh4h0,"Yeah, the enchantress killed the movie for me. It felt like The Mummy: DC Edition without the humor of the Mummy series. ",4w86a7
d6n3uku,I don't understand how you can fight the enchantress with bullets and explosions. The fight seemed odd to me ,4w86a7
d75kybr,"Seriously, like half of them have no real powers. ",4w86a7
d667705,"Well the fact she was too powerful at least led to an awesome final fight sequence where she casually fights the whole squad, even with all their different fighting styles.

Her plotline just needed a few more scenes of fleshing out and it might have been golden.",4w86a7
d66g3ye,"Most definitely. They destroyed a city took out millions then they cant kill a few people armed with boomerangs, a sword, a bat and a few guns. ",4w86a7
d66dhoj,[deleted],4w86a7
d65qeuh,"Right, because the only sensible use for something like the suicide squad (i.e. a group of criminals) is to pull off a heist. For any other task you are better off just using the assets that you already have. If the job is just to blow shit up and kill people, we already have what we need to do that.",4w86a7
d66lifh,"A montage of them doing other mission would have been nice Aswel, even if it were just in the form of super slow mo shots of them beating people down, rather than just have Diablo be like ""that's my family!"" That he's known less than 24hours...also if they all hadn't become good guys in the end...that would have made a good villain movie Aswel I feel.",4w86a7
d68gwsv,"This is really concise and would've made for a far better movie.

Escalating the stakes to a complete devastation of earth and humanity via some quasi-Egyptian hula dancer was completely unnecessary. They already had a ""big bad"" in Joker, not sure why they felt the need to add a witch, her brother Anubis, a CGI laser storm with Stargate, and a bunch of FootClan soldiers with nice watches.",4w86a7
d65lana,That's actually pretty good. I'd watch that. ,4w86a7

d6584ta,"Yeah that's what I thought. It was like Joker thought he'd won his game by getting into her head that far, and it would have been the perfect ending to let her die there, but she got into his as well - in my head he justifies saving her by thinking life's more fun with her around.",4w86a7
d65avdn,YES. I just wish that dynamic -- where it's never totally clear how much of their interaction is pure Joker manipulation versus him possibly caring about her -- was established a little better in the film to set this up. Like during the therapy session or something.,4w86a7

d66ojaw,YES. Totally agree that was a great scene. The Joker in this seemed way too in love with Harley. She's supposed to be his property and play thing. I can get him coming to rescue her but he just seemed to controlled and romantic. Maybe he was this way because of the babies they lost? It definitely seemed to paint that picture with Harley's dream sequence and the baby clothes in Jokers weapons room. ,4w86a7

d65af8b,"I thought Joker was going to escape in Arkham, capture her, and torture her into insanity. That's what it looked like in the trailers.

d6fl8xo,"I was confused because that fall shouldn't have killed her as Joker survives and is transformed in Ace Chemicals. So why did he dive in to help?

Also kinda confused bc Harley's reaction to the chemicals physically is much different than Joker's. She's not quite 100% white and her hair just gets bleached. Idk",4w86a7
d6p5lpu,"Honestly, I feel like the romance was forced and dedicated to fans.",4w86a7
d764iut,"It's good because it tried to bring back at least one important aspect of Harley Quinn that comics and stuff have steadily lost, which is Harley *willingly chooses* to hang with the Joker, because deep down she's as screw-loosed as he is, and she wanted that freedom.
If you look at Harley related stuff in comics/internet these days she's become nothing more than a serious boring domestic-abuse story, where she 'goes good' and just becomes a bit of a hyper-sexualised Mary Sue with a ""haha so random""quirk.

No.

She is a villain. Or she was. A fun villain that was in an abusive relationship with Joker, but it went both ways. 

So a fun, unredeemed villain, and plays best off of Joker.

d67nx8i,Look up IMDB trivia for the film. They reworked the original script in post. Originally Joker was supposed to be abusive towards Harley and she turns on him after he pushes her out of the plane to save his life.

DC, you hired writers and directors to do a job. You paid them for the job. They filmed the movie and just because you saw Deadpool be successful doesn't mean you should butcher your original film to try and capitalise on that by being hip and funny when the original vision wasn't.

d685bb7,"That was my big problem with this film, they totally misunderstood their relationship and Joker as a character. In the books, Joker is a nihilist whose sole pirpose is to destroy Batman and cause chaos. Every person he meets or resource he gains is used as a tool for that purpose, including Harley. He doesn't care about love or status, all he cares about is destroying Batman. He doesn't own clubs, he doesn't cut deals, he doesn't have people kiss his pinky ring to show respect. Harley eventually realizes this about him and leaves him to start her own gang, and he doesn't give a shit.

I don't think that anybody will be praising this version of the Joker, because it's just that. A VERSION of the Joker. Not THE Joker. To date, the only version to get it right in the live-action films was Heath Ledger. Romero was just another campy rogue, Nicholson played him as a gangster who was smitten by Vicki Vale (which is not in keeping with Joker at all), and Leto is basically the same as Nicholson, except he's smitten by Harley and doesn't give nearly as memorable a performance. Everything that this films Joker did just displayed a genuine lack of understanding for the character.",4w86a7

I mean, with Marvel, after aliens attacked New York, how do they go back and have individual story lines? Iron Man 3 felt so weird after knowing that the Avengers can assemble to handle threats. The whole world ending story line makes shows like Daredevil seem silly. To be clear, I REALLY like Daredevil. Better than any of the films even. I wish it wasn't set in the same universe as the Avengers film because I can't help thinking ""dude, aliens just attacked the city. Why does everybody give a shit about Yakuza and Irish mobs. Or court cases."" I just find it so unrealistic that they only give passing mention of that world changing event. It's the same problem that will affect the DC universe. Once you've established aliens in MOS, how do you go back to individual story lines with local threats? Marvel did better by building up slowly. All the first movies were individual characters with local threats. They built up to aliens. DC universe started with them. ",4w86a7

Compare a character like Drax to anyone in SS and you begin to notice why. We never see how Drax came to be as his origin was hinted at and only slightly mentioned. It wasn't spoon fed with time wasting scenes.

There are moments in Guardians, like when Drax keeps hitting Ronan when he's got him in a chokehold, that make you root for the characters because of their spirit. SS didn't have anything like that. It was just basic Hollywood scenes that were done well. It's a quirky superhero movie from 2005, the standard has been raised much higher than that.",4w86a7

It did several brilliant things all at once; it revealed character, through action; it perfectly established exactly why Deadshot (whose power is basically ""guns"") was a better choice than an extra SEAL; and it developed slowly, that you only realize what's happening as the other characters do, which generates just the right amount of suspense and breathlessness. If the rest of the film had been close to that level, it would have made up for some of the weaker characterizations and massive plot cliches.

I will say, it's a better film than BvS, and maybe deserves a RT score in the 50's, rather than the 20's. They oversold it, in my opinion.

When an X-men movie or Spiderman is a critical failure, nobody blames Marvel and goes right for Sony or Fox. This very much a Warner Bros matter.

The first scene where he helped Harley escape the Squad didn't make much sense since she quickly reunited with them, unless its only purpose was to setup Harley for her encounter with Enchantress. I guess his second rescue of Harley at the end was major, since it's probably setting up for future movies. In hindsight, it just seemed like his purpose in this movie was to explain Harley's origin story.",4w86a7
d65gdc4,"My issues were in line with yours.

For starters, joker isn't just a regular guy and he doesn't have any identifiable mental illness. This joker acted like a manic schizophrenic, for literally no reason.

Like I explained to my girlfriend (and I'm aware there are generally different versions of joker) the joker that is mostly accepted as a pure, legitimate threat to Batman is not some drug dealer who took too much speed and got his skin bleached.

This joker could have been great, but he shows up for two minutes at a time to literally act crazy and then shoot someone.
Joker is always a wonderful foil for Batman because he is calculating and always able to anticipate the good guys moves. 
Joker wouldn't have needed anyone to tell him where Harly was, he would have either known or anticipated it.

Joker wouldn't have just said ""oh you don't want no beef!?"" Over and over, he would have told him it was fine and hardly is beautiful, any man should want her. Then beat him to death when he touches Harly 

Joker is truly sadistic, like, early GOT Ramsey sadistic. He absolutely adores screwing with people because he can. He loves causing pain and making people suffer for who they are. 

Instead of intimidating the guard, the joker the majority of us are familiar with would have brought in a hooded figure and told him it was his wife and that if he didn't help him get Harly he would kill her, then, after the guard helps, shoot the hooded figure, let the guard run to the body and remove the hood to find it was one of his guards and not his wife. While joker manically laughs at this joke he played on the guard.

This joker didn't really bring the violence or the sophistication I thought he would.
Instead, opting for machine guns and kingpin antics.

I agree, sadly I think the thing that annoys me the most is that I think Robbie is a great cast for a classic Harley, in this it seems it was too forced for my taste and the inter-character dynamics were off in some parts (calling them friends, Joker/Harley in general). Hell that friends line could have worked fine if they didn't play it straight, use it as part of Harley being crazy.

>Jai Courtney as Boomerang.

I liked him too, although I wish he was more of a selfish cunt. Also he was pretty much just a knife fighter when he should have been the boomerang version of Deadshot in terms of skill. The trick boomerangs were nice though.

>Amanda Waller. 

Killing the FBI agents was way too heavy handed. It was like they didn't think we'd get that she can be pretty evil without tossing it in our face. 

>The team becoming friends did not feel earned.

100% agreed.

>Joker was interesting but needed way more screentime or none at all... His relationship with Quinn was also very underdeveloped and didn’t explain why she loved him so much after he tortured her.

I personally don't mind Harley not really having a reason to love Joker, half of the time it's put down as being dragged into the Joker's insanity.

I agree, it honestly seemed like Joker was a remnant of an older script which they left in so 'much'due to marketing. Either give him something to do or cut his screentime right down until the next SS or Batman, not this middle shit where he doesn't do anything.

Also 100% not a fan of him actually giving a shit about Harley, the dynamic of Harley loving him while he effectively treats her as a toy does great things for both their characters imo. 

>But if they already had Batman and the Flash, why did they need a team of villains? 

Yeah this confused me. Really it was the Flash that made the writing sloppy, I could understand the government not thinking Batman can handle big threats however the Flash is OP as fuck. Particularly when this SS wasn't very strong in terms of meta-humans, the Flash (or WW, Superman, Aquaman) would easily be more effective than all of them.

>Why didn’t the Joker just break into the prison from the start to get Quinn if he could do it at the end? 

Hopefully he found it funnier this way.

More realistically it's just a writing error.

>Deadshot and Quinn agreed to kill Flag and his men to escape. Two minutes later when Flag is getting killed by the monsters Deadshot tells Quinn to save him because “if he dies we all die”. But that was your plan just moments ago???

Deadshot always needed the bombs neutralized first.

>The city setting was very bland and boring and it was so obvious they had removed all the people not to get flak like they did for MoS.

Except for that huge ass destruction they showed anyway, the storm covered a huge area. At some point society is going to collapse if they keep suffering these massive losses to their infrastructure/technology/population. I would have thought with less powerful protaganists in this movie they could move away from a threat to more than just a city, but nooope.

>They honestly didn’t really feel like villains. People kept telling us they were villains and the characters themselves loved reminding us about it but they never really showed it.

I agree. I think Harley was fine in that she just does whatever she wants. Deadshot being fundamentally decent at the end is also fine, however there should also be some real villains/assholes who are being controlled by Waller.

d659v3d,"> The soundtrack had good songs but quite a few felt like they were just thrown in randomly. Gave me the feeling they were trying to do what Guardians of the Galaxy did so well with using established songs along with an orchestral score, so they just had to cram in enough pop songs for a full album into the movie.

So, a group of misfits and criminals, most of which aren't really human except for the main character (who spends the movie angsting over his family) join together to take on a severly over-powered evil villaln who's going to do some hyper-powered magic shit to destroy the world, and only win by coming together as a family and a team, and through the self-sacrifice of one of the other team members for his ""new family"". And all while making funny quips and to a soundtrack of classic pop songs.

d66gyl6,"Just saw it and thought I'd have a conversation with someone in this thread on it. 

Will Smith did great, Margot Robbie was a pretty perfect Harley Quinn 90% of the time and I never had a problem with the ""suicide squad"" line even in the trailers. Basically all the actors were pretty good in it with maybe only Katana just kinda being there. 

The editing wasn't *that* bad. They really shot themselves in the foot for rushing their intros so hard. They probably could've let that first section breathe an extra 5-10 minutes. But besides that, only when they were in that building midway in does it kinda sorta feel a bit sloppy. Not terrible but noticeable. Any flashback was led into decently enough. 

Diablo opened up to them so I get that he probably felt a closeness to them but it did feel a bit overdone. No more than really any big blockbuster though. Like anyone ever feel a connection with any love interest in any big superhero movie besides maybe Iron Man? 

Their biggest misstep to me is how they cut out the Joker's stuff. It seems like they cut anything of him being rough with Harley. Screams of execs panicking which probably threw off the more clunky spots of act 2. 

Katana was always a good guy character so she was just thrown in to be with the good guys. Her motivation must've been cut out sadly...

Croc was pretty visually menacing and the little he had, he did pretty great with it all. 

I loved Diablo's final form! Them fighting and making Enchantress' brother's chest start to melt was all pretty fun. I'm glad one of them leveled up enough to be capable of fighting things on that scale. Sad he died since he was pretty great.

And I thought she was surprisingly menacing as the villain. If I had it my way, I would've made had her be with the squad but constantly flip back and forth between them and her brother till he finally takes control of her in the 3rd act. I can't honestly say I know what she sounds like so I thought her voice worked well. 

And the point of the Suicide Squad was the government controls them. They don't control Batman and co. But do we really need an introduction to the Flash? We all know who he is, why not use him for fun? It's not like they're doing it to Cyborg that needs more of an introduction. 

And she was saying that now that now that Superman is gone, the government needs to prepare for a war that will happen with metahumans or aliens. They need a trump card vs that kinda stuff. I thought they made that pretty clear that the rotating cast that makes up Suicide Squad (basically anyone bad can come and go from Suicide Squad). 

Diablo melted Enchantress' brother's chest (aka his heart) and exposed it. The explosion blew up his heart and ended him. Who knows how Joker survived besides plot armor though. Or any of the others. I think Deadshot and co had seatbelts though? 

And they explained why she was in there but I honestly don't remember why. Not cause any reason, I just forgot. But she was just in the area of this disaster and her first use of her squad was to save her. A little sloppy but I liked how it turned out to be her they were saving. 

And it's kinda a raw deal for 10 years off but the point of the squad was never really in their favor in the comics. They're basically forced to do it all and their real gift at the end of it is getting out alive. 

I assume he would've broke her out but she got moved to the mission so he went there instead. 

And he realized it was a bad idea to kill him once push came to shove. I didn't see it as a problem. They were testing how far they could push till they realized it wouldn't work. 

And all the soldiers were regular people. They basically all died in that city. 

I liked the music! Like the Eminem song when they were gearing up was pretty perfect. GotG doesn't own the idea of using real music in a movie and I thought both did it well even though SS used way more songs. 

And people keep saying this but didn't they feel like villains!? Harley seemed to absolutely revel in being evil. Deadshot was basically the best assassin in the world (what more needs to be said than that? He's never ate babies in the comics either). Diablo was a bad guy then killed his whole family. Croc kills and eats people (he's actually a bit of a vigilante in the comics nowadays though). And Captain Boomerang is basically a slimy thief. And they all fought against the higher ups till they realized they had no way out but they were ready to kill all the soldiers around them till they saw they were up against monsters.

Yeah, but if I'm gonna be honest, I don't think I would want to see him any longer than I did.. They introduced him as ""the man who can climb anything"" and then he just used a few grappling hooks. 

>Amanda Waller murders her people in cold blood because they weren’t “cleared” for what they witnessed. Why the fuck was her staff not cleared? This is some Bond villain level bullshit.

If you saw her in Arrow you would know this is just one step up from that version of Waller. She isn't ""break a few eggs to make an omelette"", instead, shes a ""break the whole kitchen, get a new one and a chef to hand feed her the omelette"".

The Squad is given the choice of do the mission for reduced sentence (the carrot) or die from nano bombs (the stick). She is supposed to be the other stick in case nano bombs are disabled. Towards the end the squad is empathetic toward Ricks loss so they help.

> Diablo confronts the Enchantress because he “Won’t lose another family!” What the hell? He considers this group of murderers he’s known for a whole of twenty minutes family?

In fact, as soon as that ridiculous shot of the prison Louisiana came on screen and the first few strums of House of the Rising Son came in at the very beginning of the movie, I could tell they blew the tone of the movie and it was going to be way worse than I expected, and a few minutes of the film itself confirmed that impression.

And especially in the attitude of Waller.

With Exorcist: The Beginning, the director delivered an atmospheric movie, but not the bloody, jump-scare filled romp that the studio (WB again) were hoping for, so they reshot most of the movie with another director to change its tone, which didn't really work. When the director's original version was released later as Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist, the contrast between them clearly showed that the reshot version was very much a movie made by committee and suffered for it. While the director's version is widely considered the superior, neither is held in very high regard.

Also there is a city with some supernatural world ending shit going on, but Batman, The Flash (who we know is currently active) or Wonderwoman, couldn't be bothered to check out what is the problem? And why the fuck is Bruce Wayne asking Waller for info on meta humans? World greatest detective really doesn't apply to movie Batman (he couldn't even find a boat in BvS) Also the members of the squad are supposed to be ""the worst of the worst"" But we only saw Killer Croc defending himself against people that attacked him, El Diablo turned himself in and was a good guy the whole movie, Deadshot was a hero pretending he was a big bad villain, Captain boomerang was a bank robber (the worst of the worst) Harley was the only one that could maybe fit that description the rest were luke warm bad at best.

Yes. That's Waller's hubris, thinking her leverage is enough to control god like beings.

June Moon had to willingly transform into Enchantress. And when she did, Waller had a handle on her. The witch's escape from the hotel took who knows how long to enact. Of pushing limits. 

To create Harley. The Joker doesn't always take over every aspect of the plot in comics. 

Incubus consistently knocked helicopters out of the sky. Nothing constructive was going to happen with them there

The bit where he asks her to die for him, lets her jump into a huge vat of... whatever liquid it was - only to change his mind and save her after all. You mentioned the part where he leaves her to drown in the car, and then there's also the bit where he seems ready to just ""give"" her away to a thug. On that last one I'm not sure if he changed his mind because the thug was ""ungrateful"" or he never really intended to follow through anyway.

There are two minor issues I have with this version of HQ/Joker though:

1. He spends most of the movie trying to save HQ, not because he needs her for something but because he loves her, where the classic Joker/Quinn relationship is incredibly one sided. He'll use her if it suits him, or leave her to rot if it's a bother to help her out. Quinn is like a dog you can kick as many times as you like, it keeps coming back. I imagine they changed this dynamic because some people get really vocal about abuse (*of women*) in media nowadays.

2. This HQ isn't truly batshit insane. She's acting and talking crazy, joking around. But when the plot needs her to be relatable, she turns sane. The conversation at the bar, her demeanor when she loses J and especially the clever ruse against enchantress at the end.

Doesn't break the movie for me, I enjoyed it. I just wish they played it a little less safe.",4w86a7

The Wonder Woman trailer was awesome and it was my first time seeing it. Everyone here and elsewhere saw it on Youtube or at Comic Con week when it was posted here. Trailers can be done well but if not it also spoils. I read a few comments and people were complaining they saw the whole movie the trailer.

The only thing I knew about Suicide Squad was that DC animated movie I saw. I was expecting using that as a source, which somewhat delivered. The characters were awesome. One of my friends complained that it took nearly 15 or 20 minutes to introduce each character but in my opinion it needed to be done to explain each character, much better than maybe JLA? But I guess each guy is getting their own movie. 

Plot/story wise it probably wasn't the strongest thing in this film. David Ayer can write great films. He did Training Day, End of Watch and recently Fury. I guess his strong point is in films dealing with teams with a mission objective. I just wished that they could've worked around that Enchantress character. Change the focus from ""save my girl"" to maybe ""beat or catch this enemy"" like in other Suicide Squad stories. I haven't read many Suicide Squad comics or so but I know they could've written a better story. I like the characters overall. The way everyone was cast was great. The actors matched how I imagined the characters on film. My favourite was Amanda Waller she's just as diabolical as she is in the comics. 

The movie overall is great. I gave it a 9/10 on that poll here simply because it was better than BvS and it was a better movie as a whole. Maybe everyone here on /r/movies has a higher threshold of entertainment but heck I enjoyed the hell out of this movie. It was great stuff.",4w86a7

Also, the main bad guys are literally laying waste to tanks, helicopters, entire platoons with the blink of an eye and yet the solution is to send in a small squad of people that are good with guns and knives?

Clearly the original pacing and plot were the Joker's goons tearing shit up and wrecking shit - so the squad is sent in, during this battle is when we have the Enchantress make her getaway and become the primary villain.

However, with them chopping that out and re-ordering events, a lot of stuff just plain doesn't make sense.

d655jqh,"The early stuff with the disjointed Snyder-esque ""vignette"" structure really hurt the thing getting going. There was no flow or momentum. Just ""bits"" strung together.

Biggest problem was that they didn't have the ticking clock situation start earlier. There was no energy behind the assembly/selection of the squad. Only that ""The Next Superman might be a bad guy"" thing.

It badly needed a cold open with a the bad guy starting their apocalyptic rise, then assembling the team to combat a threat that was already on the running down the minutes til disatser. Even if that cold open was a slight re-arrangement of the Enchantress Story. A failed attempt to create a ""Superman Killer"" (with Flagg saying later, when all is revealed, that ""we thought we could control it, we were wrong""). So the actual Suicide Squad was an emergency ""Plan B"", which they later find out and re-enforces the idea that nobody really likes them or wants to work with them, and are only using them because there are no other options than to use totally disposable scumbags.

And definitely use the uncontrollable nature of Diablo's fire-god entity to cancel out Enchantress's uncontrollable nature. Stress repeatedly, that these supernatural god-lke powers just can't be controlled well enough to use as a focused weapon or defensive strategy. Better to use a gang of Meta-human assholes who respond well to bargaining, leverage and some sense of personal redemption or new purpose.

This also maintains BvS's theme that god-level meta-humans like Superman are too powerful to be fully trusted or controlled, even when possessing strong moral values (we've already seen that Supes goes bad in the future because of something happening to Lois).",4w86a7

What are you basing this on exactly? Harley in general is a very new character to DC Comics. This is all new and all different from any Joker you have ever seen on any screen. I didn't mind their interaction in this as eventually they can go into their split and let him become who he is in the comics and her as well. Joke was a cameo in this in a similar way that Batman was, part of the secondary stories but nothing important to the squad. He represents another member's counterpart to the outside world. Joker was never meant to have an important role in the Suicide Squad. ",4w86a7

There's also a sort of 'she's my property' vibe about the relationship as well. Like despite how he acts about her, it's almost more because he views her as his property rather than the love of his life. ",4w86a7

Just to add to the ""hold back the gods"" comment; after seeing this trailer I thought that this movie would be a group of ""bad guys"" coming together to fight an empty of the government or mercenaries or something of that nature.  Bringing supernatural power into it totally ruined the film for me.  Like c'mon, how can a band of mortals with above average abilities, (minus the massive fire casting skeleton), take on gods laying waste to the planet.

Also they held back on the joker character. He seemed to fade in and out of the story randomly.  Sort of background action while these gods are reeking havoc.  They kind of skimped on the characters as there was like one scene of deadshot doing a trickshot to kill someone.  

To conclude, this movie would have been miles better if the suicide squad battled someone of the calibre of Bane, and his thugs and contained a deeper character background/plot line.

Potentially avoided because people not familiar with the comics would see him as a discount Deadpool. I'm not familiar with any of the DC comics (just buying the Marvel comics I've been following is expensive enough for now) so I'm not sure how similar they are on paper, but from your description I could definitely see it confusing or annoying the movie-only crowd. 

> Diablo knows these guys for a couple of hours and declares them his new family who he is willing to die for.

Fighting side-by-side with people changes the way you see people. Not sure it's enough to justify this, and it's probably actually just poor writing/editing, but I can see someone motivated (or bored) enough writing a compelling argument involving his solitude and how he latched on to them as a replacement family through fighting side-by-side or something.

I enjoyed it overall too, but definitely some major flaws. There's potential in the DCEU, but they keep putting their movies in the hands of people who are doing a shit job of turning the potential into great movies. Marvel has got competent talent making their movies and they're rocking it (even with people who wouldn't traditionally watch comic book movies), DC really needs to step up their game if they want their universe to survive with mainstream audiences. This wasn't a great movie, it was an entertaining movie - I didn't feel like I wasted my time or money, but I probably won't watch it again on my own.",4w86a7

Batman still wins though, and that's how she ends up in jail, abandoned, just like at the start of Suicide Squad. Then I dunno, maybe a whole other movie where you see the entire origins of Deadshot. You could maybe throw in another secondary Batman character here, if you wanted, but the whole movie is about this top notch expert assassin, who seems to have no match....until he gets beat up by, you guessed it, Batman, at the end of it.

> Why would Deadshot not take his freedom and his daughters tuition in exchange for this woman he barely knows life?

i think most of these characters are pretty conflicted. deadshot doesn't particularly want to be the piece of shit he thinks his daughter thinks he is. he doesn't want to be a hitman anymore. so it's kind of a question of, do you secure your future for you daughter but be someone she can't look up to?

he's possessed by a literal demon, yes, like june moon/enchantress.

the problem was essentially waller's own making, and she was trying to cover her tracks. that said, surely that kind of thing would have attracted the attention of someone like flash, whom we see tracking down a petty criminal, or wonder woman who's off, what, sleeping with batman or something now?

d65is0b,"I'll try to explain why I, and many others don't like it:

-Bad Characters: other than quinn and deadshot, the other characters don't get ample time to have a personality or a character arc. This made me not care about the characters at all in any action scene, which is one of the main drivers for making good action. The villain was also generic which made me groan. Also Deadshot refused to kill Harley after given an ultimatum which he would clearly accept. He knew her for A DAY and he turns down an assassination (which is what he fucking does) even though it would reunite him with his daughter, which is his main character motivation.

Bad Editing- The scenes are brief and have no time to breathe. They're all chopped up together so that its 90 minutes of scenes with no narrative thrust. The plot feels awkward and stuck. This bored me and made me lose interest halfway through the movie.

Pandering soundtrack- The licensed music felt really awkward and forced in order to pander to the audience that like GotG's soundtrack. GotG's soundtrack made sense, and it was organic. This movie's soundtrack felt forced. 

Bad dialogue- I know you said you liked them, but the humor felt forced to me. Every joke fell flat. And when El Diablo said the squad was his 'family' I laughed because they never established the fact that he liked the other characters.

Boring action- As I said earlier, the charactrs were boring so I felt no tension in the action scenes. The dumb CGI zombies just exploded in a poof of ash. It got really redundant after the first scenes.",4w86a7

Uh, well, you see -- oh, where are the X-Men? They're UPSTATE New York, this is Manhattan. Yes, Westchester County where their mansion is... yes, yes, that's the next county over from New York City. But it's far! Well sure, they have a hypersonic jet that can go Mach 50. And yes, they have like twenty group teleporters, but -- oh the Fantastic Four?

it hints at a larger mythology, as does batman's brief appearances.

> I didn't like Margot Robbie's performance. Yes she's hot and yes she's an awesome actress but her character didn't work from me. Nothing about her seemed legitimately insane or menacing. 

i'm not sure she was supposed to be. she's kind of joker's wind-up toy. she's kinda fucked in the head, and might kill some people here and there, but that was never really the point of her character. she's the girlfriend joker crafted for himself. she's kind of a *victim* of stockholm syndrome, emotional and sexual abuse, more so than a serial killer in her own right.

It was a waste of time, really.

The object, it turns out, is a dossier of the Suicide Squad members and of the new Meta Humans (Flash, Aquaman, etc).  She then tells him to 'stop working nights' and he replies that he and his friends will shut down the squad.

It makes no sense because he personally put away at least half the squad so he knows who they are.  

He already saw the email with the youtube clips of all the meta humans so he at least has a start on them too.  

He's 'protecting' Waller because she gave him this largely redundant information but at the same time wants to destroy her.

Finally, I think it's supposed to surprise the audience that she knows he is Batman but it's clear she knows because this billionaire is suddenly asking for all the information of other superheroes and villains.  he doesn't even deny it an instead says he might get his super friends to shut down the squad.

The issue with SS wasn't the lack of thematic depth or intricate storytelling, it's that it just wasn't very well executed.

One reason I believe that everyone chooses Marvel movies (i.e. The Avengers) more is because most of those characters had movies before they teamed up. They all had a rich backstory that showed where they came from. The portrayal of the characters in Suicide Squad was pretty well done, but not great. 

(SPOILERS) I have not read the comics for it, but my biggest problem was The Enchantress. I do not think she was the best option for a villain and the soldiers she was creating were just sloppy in my opinion. I did not care for their appearance or anything. I thought the idea of the villain was a little too much for the movie and it lowered my satisfaction for the film.

It's kind of an unfortunate artifact of the characters not knowing exactly what they're being swept up in despite the fact that the plot isn't from their perspective.  In this way the movie feels like a video game - a long intro with origins then - Fight!

The villain did in fact have motivation and we are made aware of it early on but the audience isn't given any real indication of the stakes or just what kind of power they're facing until the final fight.

I liked the movie overall I think DC is getting flack for stuff that I've been criticizing some of the shittier Marvel movies about for years now.

But seriously, we open to them in prison and make a mess out of the music score by changing it after every iTunes song preview worth of time. Showing each character with a little sound track only to get reintroduced to them again in the next scene when Waller is at dinner explaining them. Also Show don't tell... I mean come on that's like rule 1.

Too often DC is jumping to throw multiple heroes into a movie and as a result struggles to give each one enough screen time to get attached. I will say with Marvel they developed those characters before the team up and it meant less explaining and rehashing flashbacks. But the reality is the movies with more heroes sell more and DC wants to capitalize on that. 

Too much money getting in the way of art here and I think that's where these films have truly been failing us. Until the studios start treating these as more than a free money cop out we will get better stuff. But I will say don't forget that phase 1 of Marvel was lower caliber than the newer stuff imo.

Warner Brothers felt the same way and decided to throw a wrench into the whole process by having a company that makes trailers edit a tentpole film...

That's who edited the final cut for Suicide Squad... They edit TRAILERS, not films.

His best moment was that world-weary ""Yeah"" he mutters when Deadshot points out that Waller is a ""mean woman.""

Regarding point 2 -- I thought she was a viable threat.  She took out a satellite, an aircraft carrier and a secret base in rapid succession.  But yeah, the actress playing her did not have gravitas equal to the character's menace level.

And as for point 3 -- well that is a hall-mark of DC, isn't it?  It was so blatant in Man of Steel it became a plot point in BvsS.  But in THIS movie the most egregious example of innocents dying is not the killing that Enchantress was doing.  After all, our team of ""good"" bad-guys was trying to shut that down.  The worst example of the movie being callous about collateral damage was Amanda Waller executing all those FBI agents because they weren't cleared to ""know"" about the meta humans.  What the actual fuck was THAT?  Plot-wise I realize they needed to get rid of all those extra people so that the plot could focus on the rescue of Waller and I suppose having her be so ruthless nicely mirrored the movie's theme of bad-guys-doing good by having a ""good guy"" do something awful.

d68jzj0,"> All in all, not a piece of ****, but definitely some problems. I my opinion, Disney/Marvel puts out this kind of schlock with THE AVENGERS, THOR, and IRON MAN, so why is DC/WB getting so much hate? I think that SUICIDE SQUAD, with all it's problems, is better than anything Disney/Marvel is doing. So if the critics love those pieces of garbage? Why so much hate for SS?

I'll give it a shot. Marvel's team movies, which are the most comparable, focus on character interaction. Theyre character pieces, the primary purpose is to establish interesting characters, flesh them out, and watch them play off of each other. So they stick in your head, theyre memorable, they feel more real. It's why the villain is so often lacking, because there's not much room left over to really develop them. Suicide Squad has some characters, some of whom are interesting and some who aren't, but all we really learn about anyone who isn't Deadshot or Harley is told in a quick flashback. after that, the focus is almost entirely on the spectacle, rather than the interaction. It's why one of the common complaints is that they don't end up feeling like a familu. You don't really see how any of them bond or feel about each other so them ending up feeling like a family has no impact, because you don't see any emotional reason as to why they should feel that way.

The rest is all subjective opinion, but Marvel's movies are better written and better edited than this was. It was choppy, corny, and full of minor plot holes and at least one major hole. Iron Man and the Avengers are, at their core, superbly made. Any weak spots and faults they have tend to be countered by the quality of the other parts.

So, Diablo isn't just pyrokinetic... he's essentially hosting a spirit of vengeance within him (though unlike Enchantress', his is way more amicable / controllable.) When Enchantress tried to get into his head with that vision, he was able to see through it because his inner mechanisms are *divine* in the same way Enchantress' are.

Her mortal mental manipulation could affect him, sure, but his demon essentially kept him GROUNDED (or below the grounded, am I right?) through the illusions. 

I feel like Enchantress could tell there was something **more** within Chato, though she couldn't exactly tell what. So when she takes note of his being able to 'see' she's inquiring about how long he's been **more**.

His response might not have been in that context, but the answer is just as proper regardless. He's always been able to see because the demon's always been with him. The demon's always been able to see, because it's always been.",4w86a7

- Harley just met these guys. Yeah they are bonding but she didn't really betray them. Given the situation, it's not like Joker was able to get everyone. He barely got Harley. 

Deadshot may have been bummed but he didn't hold it against her and the other guys didn't know about it. 

Flagg not shooting Harley? Well they were being shot at and he didn't know exactly what was going on. Her escaping honestly was not a priority to him.

Reprimanded by Flagg/Waller. Well Waller tries to have her killed and thinks she succeeded. Harley isn't an employee, what reprimand can she really give at the end of the movie(especially when Harley helped save the day). Flagg besides not minding that Waller killed her own people(Flagg and Waller are not good people), again he's compromised with June and honestly has nothing to say to Harley. Her actions are maybe the sanest thing she's done. 

Why she came back? I don't think you get these people are psychopaths. Harley has nowhere to go. Her boyfriend is dead. The squad is really all she has right now. They take her back no problem which is why she chose to return.

- Their mission was not only to rescue Waller but also that it was Waller's mess she created. They were pissed and just done.  They think Waller is dead which helps and they are not scared of Flagg.

At first they bothered me. I didn't like the pause it caused in terms of pacing for the movie. Then they grew on me. All the weird cuts, neon-highlighted objects, cartoony graphics...  it all grew on me. This movie had it's own fucking identity and I loved it. The feeling I had when the movie ended felt similar to how I feel when I finish one-shot comic or short graphic novel: it was fun, abbreviated, and I got what I needed for it.

I liked the Batman and Flash cameos. I wish they were shot better, but I still like the concept and how they approached it, you know? Felt as sensible as anytime a character pops up in a comicbook in which said character is not the primary focus. The idea of brief incidents and direct involvement (from) with these heroes... being able to have LARGE conflicts and set-pieces take place without THEM (supes, bats, ww, etc) being center stage... it was cool, in my opinion. Fun way to tell a story.

Man. I hate the hate this movie is receiving. I want more stories like this in the DCU. I want to see big name actors take on these roles; not everyone has to play a Tony Stark. I felt like every single person on the screen enjoyed themselves. Fuck even whoever played Slipknot.

The pace of the entire movie was frantic. It rarely settled into a scene, just jumped around from location to location. It had a few good moments but most of it was ""oh you should know about this, and this and this and this"" without pause.

The dialog was nearly cringe-worthy at times. Enchantress's last line was ""You don't have the balls"". A thousand year-old spirit knows our slang! Cool! /s. Not to mention that every line out of Will Smith's mouth was a generic black guy joke.

And then there were way too many characters to keep up with. Natasha
Katana and Croc felt useless throughout the movie as characters, they barely got introductions.Deadshot, Harley, Rick, Diablo, and Boomerang was all that was really needed, but they shoved in a few more for fanservice.

Overall I enjoyed the movie too, but it was far from perfect. It's something that a director's cut could actually fix though (unlike for bvs),  extending scenes and filling in more time for the characters. ",4w86a7
d65a9gy,"I think the biggest thing they did poorly is what you're arguing the movie was about and that's character development. You can't have that many main characters and develop a backstory/connection within the time of a single movie. 

Avengers does this so well because the main characters all have their own movie. SS took a bunch of characters casual viewers would never have heard of and gave them some flashbacks. [Spoiler](/s ""I think the worst villian (but my favorite character) was captain boomerang and at the end of the movie I was hoping his head would blow up just for comedic effect."")

I also think you're underestimating the point of a villain. A good villain rallies an audience behind the protagonists and bonds the characters together. When you don't have a good villain it's hard to make that connection.

You add the cringe worthy dialogue, hodgepodge editing, and questionable acting to all of this and you have Suicide Squad.",4w86a7

I've seriously lost respect for that site in the last year, it seems it's cool or some sort of hipster critic trend to absolutely shit on films that are really just average to good. Maybe it garners the reviewers more attention? Either way that site is just opinion, not critique.

I partially agree with you. The site is still mostly critique in my opinion, and I certainly think Suicide Squad was average at best, but reviewers do seem to be getting onto a sensationalist kick and they use very hyperbolic statements to garner attention.

Saying that Suicide Squad is an awful film comparable in poorness to Fant4stic is more likely than not someone who's just trying to get attention.

Saying it was as bad as BvS I can understand even if I don't agree.

I agree that Joker didn't really have much time anyway, but I think the bigger issue was that he wasn't written well.

A character can still leave a lasting effect with just 5 to 10 minutes of screen time if they're written well. Unfortunately this Joker wasn't. His dialogue was just inane insanity, and he had no good lines or monologues.

I thought he would get a good back and forth with Dr Quinzel during a flash back where Leto could do his thing, but instead we just got random pieces of him at a club just being weird.

d65eq6z,"Suicide Squad Spoiler Summary(part 1): 

So I went into the movie theatre about 2 mins later than I should and the show sorta started, but oh well, let’s begin, shall we? I could be wrong about a lot of things but this is the internet, alright? So much doesn’t make sense.

She: Amanda Waller Joker: Joker? Crazy Woman: Harley Quinn Crocodile: Killer Croc Burning man: El Diablo Will: Deadshot Batman: Bruce Wayne Boomerang: Captain Boomerang? Another dude with flashy knifes and ropes: Slipknot The Exorcists: Dr. June Moone, Solider dude: Rick Flag Flash: Doesn’t matter Japanese sword woman: Tatsu Yamashiro / Katana Exorcists bro: Incubus

So, she tells ‚somebody’ about the main characters of the story. One by one explaining their background story so non comic fans actually understand what the fuck is going on. by the way, my memory is not that good so the sequence might be wrong, but here we go.

So she, wants them, to fight crime. I went in few minutes late so am not sure what happened at the beginning. But crazy woman was a person meant to heal the joker, than he tortured her and made her crazy. Interesting. then joker and crazy woman were driving away from batman, batman did some shit, joker’s car flew into the ocean. Batman jumps down to catch them, joker is gone, harley is there, then it just goes a bit weird so just ignore that. Anyway, harley got caught. Burning man accidentally burnt this family and surrendered himself. Burning man got caught. Boomerang dude was robbing a bank with a partner, then he hit his partner, then flash appears. Boomerang dude got caught. Crocodile was… umm… it kinda got messy but from what i understood he was born looking like a monster, so people treated him like a monster and he became a monster. So somewhere along the line he got caught. yeah. Then there’s another dude with flashy knifes and ropes but he dies soon so fuck him. Will here is a guy good with guns. I … kinda forgot how he got caught. Fuck, I really shouldn’t be doing this. Exorcist was a human who explored something she shouldn’t have, and got possessed. So cause solider dude loves the exorcists human form, he will go with the plan.

After the basic explanation, she goes to have a meeting with a bunch of professional government guys and tries to convince the ‚boss‘ man thing to agree with her plan. He obviously is like, ‚no fucking way man‘, And she’s like, ‚no you don’t understand, what if superman becomes a terrorist and attacks us, what then?‘ This makes boss man hesitate. Then She’s like, ‚hey, you there, come over here, show him this dangerous thing that you don’t like to do but I really need you to do so he will want us to pass the plan and you’ll have to do more of than thing you don’t like to do.‘ She’s like, I really hate this but alright man, you got my heart and I’ll die if I don’t do the thing you want me to do.’ She does this really tricking cool exorcist dark magic shit and goes get a secret file from somewhere that the boss dude really needed. Than he’s like, fuck yeah, I’ll accept your plan.

This sequence could be wrong as well, but fuck it, it’s not important.

Soldier dude and she go to the prison to convince the criminals to join the ‚suicide squad‘. No one really has any interest in joining. But Will got to do some shooting thing and fuck yeah was that cool. And she promised Will to pay for his daughter’s tuition for school n’ shit.

Then we move to the exorcists lying with soldier dude in bed. Not sex scene which is weird but neat. Which movie doesn’t have a fucking sex scene amiright? Sigh. So the exorcists that’s over the human’s body and warps away. Goes to her house, doesn’t take her heart. Not sure why but there might have been some mechanics where it destroys the heart if she approaches it. She finds a brother exorcist in her house and warps to a dude in the bathroom to make give her bro a body. She teleports back to solider boy and she returns to human form. Her bro goes to a subway, faints, drags 2 or 3 dudes on to the tracks and makes himself mega monster dude. Oh yeah, he also has tentacles and is supposively super powerful. Not sure what the fuck is happening and she returns to her bro and she stabs her heart and bro gives her his strength and what the fuck is going on?

Anyway, they create this super dangerous power in the middle of the city so she ordered the suicide squad to be assembles.

They are pulled out of their prison and get injected with explosives in their neck. They get prep talk from a bunch of people and get all dressed up. Some dude got a pink unicorn which is just fucking adorable. A grown ass criminal holding that fucking toy and going to war to save man kind? Fuck Yeah MAN!!! And All hail the almighty god her. They need to get somebody important out of a building without him getting killed. I really gotta say, the humour is on point in this movie. So they get into the helicopter and meet japanese sword bodyguard woman.

She understands english but somehow speaks in japanese all the time expecting the others to understand. Welp, thanks for the subtitles I guess… So they fly to the city n talk a bit, you need a bit of that casual time. Their pilot gets shot down and the helicopter crashes onto the floor but none of the main characters get hurt. Cough Cough. Nobody gets hurt? Like what the fuck man, some of these criminals are just mere humans and they don’t die? Sigh. I guess the power of the plot is stronger than death. Oh wait, that knife dude tries to escape and gets his head blown off. My bad. Then a quite long but cool as fuck fighting scene where everyone just beats and fires the shit out of the weird monster soldiers. And yea. The plot armour is really powerful man. Some where along the line some dude drinks from his can of something. Alright.

The ‚smash the handbag‘ scene might have been here, not too sure tho. Sorry…",4w86a7

like, where was the *unmasking* aspect? they wrote spider-man in, but without the history and without him revealing his identity and pushing for others to do the same.

and *nobody* said the bleedingly obvious. the avengers prevented *way* more death and destruction than they caused. they were being blamed for an alien invasion? seriously? they stopped it, *and* the *fucking nuke* the government tried to drop on manhattan. and now they're complaining about collateral damage on a city they tried to nuke? *come the fuck on.* this seems like something someone would argue about. particularly *tony stark* who personally deflected said nuclear missile.",4w86a7
d68u5uo,"Winter Soldier and Incredible Hulk are still the best Marvel movies. They had soul, they had conflict, they had scenes where you pumped your fist for the hero, and gripped your seat when the tension rose.

Most Marvel movies are just live action cartoons. I've been digesting DC and Marvel since I was a kid, and the Marvel movies gloss over all the serious issues their characters face. Granted DC goes full on with the angst, but Marvel is getting to campy to pull in kids to sell toys.

Doomsday wasn't in TDKR, that should of been your first indication that it isn't a complete adaptation.",4w86a7
d68qmi7,"TDKR isn't canon, BvS took some inspiration from it and that was it and the movies don't follow the comics too closely but rather they just use the same general setting anyway (for example Batman is already old before meeting all the metas, unlike in the comics).

So summed up: catatonic Joker might or not happen, probably the latter. Batman's and Joker's past history is still unknown in the DCU, we only know as much as Joker presumably killing Robin and not even that is clear, he might not even be the original joker according to some theories. And again, none of the movies are direct adaptation from the comics so there is no point trying to make sense of the timeline compared to the comics since they simply aren't the same.

Waller proved that her squad can take down metas successfully. El Diablo got to redeem his past transgressions by sacrificing himself to save the team, and in part, the world. Boomerang got some tasty JO material for the duration of his lockup, I'd chalk that us as a win. Croc got a TV man, a freaking flatscreen, with cable, in his cell.

* Incredible Hulk: Hulk and Abomination punch each other. No threat of apocalypse, possibly some clouds in the air. 

* Iron Man 2: Tony and Rhodey fight a bunch of drones and an angry Russian Mickey Rourke. No apocalypse, not very cloudy.

* Thor: Thor and Loki fight on a bridge. There is the near destruction of the Frost Giants and a gaping chasm into space, but clouds are right out.

* The First Avenger: Cap fights Red Skull on a plane filled with nukes intended for every major US city. Not quite apocalyptic, clouds are again not evil just kinda there.

* Avengers: Giant portal in the sky unleashes an army of alien invaders that get rekt by 6 people. Apocalyptic and somewhat cloud-like, though I'd personally argue the semantics that a wormhole is not the same as a swirling mass of clouds.

* Iron Man 3: Tony, Rhodey and a dickload of suits fight a whiny douche and his merry band of hotheads while the POTUS is tied up on an oil rig. Not apocalyptic, not that cloudy.

* The Dark World: Thor fights The Doctor- who is cosplaying as Drizz't for reasons he doesn't want to get into, thank you very much- with the fate of all worlds on the line. Very much apocalyptic, pretty cloudy as well.

* The Winter Soldier: Cap and Sam take on three helicarriers filled with Hydra douchenozzles and armed with weaponry that will take out millions upon activation. Not really apocalyptic, not very cloudy.

* Guardians of the Galaxy: Angry Blue Guy's plans to destroy a planet are stopped by Less Handsome Han Solo and the power of ~~dance~~ friendship. Apocalyptic, but not very cloudy.

* Age of Ultron: The Avengers fight an army of robots on a floating city that can cause an extinction-level event if it drops back to Earth. Skies are pretty clear though.

* Ant Man: Two dudes fight on a toy train set. Neither apocalyptic nor cloudy, but extremely awesome.

* Civil War: Superheroes punching each other left and right without a cloud in sight, and the vaguely apocalyptic threat was a red herring.



People are giving Marvel a pass because this doesn't actually happen in most of their movies.

Loved some aspects (aesthetic, sound track, actor performances), hated other aspects (taking dark sophisticated themes and cutesifying them so kids can watch, too much plot reduced to ciphers, terrible accents, and wtf was up with Slipknot? They literally served him up as an *Austin Powers' Goon #4 For Purposes Of Plot Exposition*. Plus plot holes for miles and unprofessional editing...)

But I was utterly confused by so many comments in this whole post - the movie I got on dvd has some different plot points to what has been discussed. Some of it is shitty editing (no explanation how Harley gets that phone beyond she's good at swallowing stuff, Enchantress says she'll build a machine, but never does) and some of it is just different: Waller didn't get captured in my dvd version. Thanks to your link, I realise I probably got a rerubbed version.

I shouldn't be surprised, I've noticed this before: Shrek in the theatre release I saw has a credits scene where Eddy Murphy as Donkey was singing 'I Like Big Butts' to his dragon girl - removed from the tv screening and the dvd I bought; the violence and sexy scenes in Deadpool were viciously tamed down on the dvd version compared to what I saw in the cinema.

Can't defend the BET bit, but it's just a few seconds of the movie.

El Diablo turned himself in, was a pacifist and pretty much a good person the entire movie. Killer Croc we only see defending himself against people that come looking to attack him, and seems to pretty much just want to be left alone.

But from the average person, say a literal Superman character came from the sky right now, would you be thinking of all the basic shit he goes through? Like I could never imagine Superman having to pay his mortgage, washing his dishes, sitting down at some deadbeat work place. I mean it is the god damn Superman, his ass can fly and lift heavy shit with ease, why would he waste time being a normal human.

This is especially true in Will Smith's case, because he's in prison, and his daughter likely suffers from a number of disadvantages.

Regardless of your opinions on affirmative action, the line makes perfect sense. White families, on average, are better prepared for college applications, and Will Smith's daughter's situation would be a perfect example of this (more affluent families would be able to offer their children tons of help with their application, while Will Smith cannot do that). Affirmative action may provide a boost to one's admissions chances, but it's an obvious truth that white people are more successful in getting into top colleges than black people.

It was a theme worth exploring once, maybe twice, but ultimately she is and has always been as warped as the Joker is, and she *wanted and chose* to follow him. 
The comics where she becomes all goody and ""*I don't need no Joker!*"" misses the point of her character, the axle she turns on.

Some fans might briefly enjoy her character becoming an over-sexualized anti-hero Mary Sue, basically a slightly random punk-rocker heroine, but it robs her character of any lasting appeal as the Joker has, and it consigns her to fading into obscurity.

Just as it's hard to seriously think of Robin without Batman, so Harley works best as a partner to Joker.

Just because there's a world war going doesn't mean the story of a father looking for his daughter who was abducted by mafia thugs in new york 1944 is any less interesting or important to those characters. You seems to have a problem with understanding the scale of the MCU and the fact that there's a whole world of people in it dealing with life. The world doesn't stop on the biggest event going on, and not every big event affects everyone in the world.

I suggest you read the comic Marvels, I think it will give you a good insight on what I'm talking about. It puts into perspective the fact that as this bigass shit is going on, there's still people dealing with cancer, loss of jobs and family drama.

>I just find it so unrealistic that they only give passing mention of that world changing event.

Well, using your examples, Daredevil S1 itself is happening specifically as a result of The Avengers, and this is made very clear. But lets put it into context, how many times do YOU need to hear about terrorism in every single modern movie? Does The Perks of Being a Wallflower lose credibility for not mentioning 9/11?

That's a good point and something they could have used as a character building moment for the Joker if they'd given him more screen time!

That also comes back to the question of why they didn't just use Batman and The Flash (and presumably Wonder Woman)?

d675juw,At least hawkeye was an elite marksman and black widow is a world class spy--both have had hand-to-hand combat training.  For Boomerang and Harley Quinn I can't figure it out.  I'm actually genuinely curious what role they play in the comics. ,4w86a7

Also if she could use telekinesis to take away weapons why didn't she take away dead shots pistol before he shot the bomb? Also why did she turn from pretty witch to ratty witch at the end. It's not like she became more evil all of a sudden. It seemed like she was more powerful when she was clean rather than dirty. She still had her heart. So much bs in the movie.

d67085c,"I liked his scenes but I see your point. A character like Joker you either give him one of the main roles or you leave him out. Having him dancing around the fringes felt a bit off. The flashbacks fleshed out Harley though, even if Joker had only a minor effect on the plot.",4w86a7

There was one scene I was disappointed in where all the villains are walking out and Harley and Croc look at each other. I was hoping there would be banter between the two as they both live in the same city but nope they just walked offscreen. ,4w86a7

d64u3kg,lmao. Have an upvote,4w86a7
d64tzhx,The scene where Enchantress comes out to get her heart and free her brother opens with Flagg devouring a chicken drumsticks in front of a window.,4w86a7
d64z1ov,There's a scene where he and June are in a room together. She's sleeping on the bed and he's staring out of the window eating a massive chicken leg. I thought it was bizarre as well. I believe it's where she becomes enchantress and goes to Wallers home to try and get the heart. ,4w86a7
d64u0dg,"When he's in a hotel room (I think) with Enchantress, there's a shot of him eating a chicken drumstick while staring out a window. It serves no function in the movie at all and was a really strange choice.",4w86a7

d64u73p,I think you're letting her off too easy. Her line delivery as well was outrageously bad.,4w86a7
d654gic,Marvel is very cookie cutter visual wise. Civil War and Winter Soldier look good but there's no real distinct style. ,4w86a7
d6530hk,"Marvel movies have a consistent look which work for them, but it's all very televisual and boring. I love Joss Whedon, but he doesn't really have a signature visual style. Outside of James Gunn, the rest are all jobbers and tv people. At least the DC movies so far take some visual chances and flourishes. Like them or not, Snyder and Ayers have styles that feel like movies, not extended tv episodes.",4w86a7
d64u6sc,"Without going too spoilery, Enchantress kind of has 2 forms - creepy sullen witch, and then another form. Her creepy sullen witch (as seen in the trailers) is great in my opinion, but she takes on this other form pretty early and just hams it for the rest of the film.",4w86a7
d64tzdi,"She spends almost the entire film dancing with an invisible hula hoop, doing some kind of weird Shakespearean accent. It's extremely odd. ",4w86a7
d64tzcc,Early on she's actually pretty good as Dr. June and even when we see brief flashes of Enchantress. Then she goes all CGI overkill in the second half of the movie and does a really over-the-top British villain accent that is fucking horrendous. I couldn't take it seriously at all.,4w86a7
d64vhvn,She's stunk in everything I've seen her in. Just a pretty face,4w86a7

d659ikx,"Hopefully, its not that it was rushed but rather too much was cut. I'm hoping for a Directors Cut that will fix a lot of the pacing issues.",4w86a7
d65c11j,Because her lack of containment created the WW3 event she promised to stop. She had to kill everyone that knew the cause of the problem to pin it on the Squad and get away clean. They were a liability when the lying starts.,4w86a7
d65bcl7,Why would they even show that,4w86a7
d65bfp4,"> I remember Black Widow and Nick Fury feeling similar in their first films. I'm sure its just a growing pain for setting up plot in another movie.

But the Joker is much more of an iconic character plus he has a legacy to live up to from past interpretations. He deserves to be introduced properly, not just sprinkled in through random disjointed scenes.  ",4w86a7

d64xatg,Looked like it honestly. ,4w86a7
d650zk7,"Yea, even Jai Courtney was unaware of the cameo.",4w86a7
d64xe4o,That explains why I hadn't anticipated or expected him at all. Most of the time comic book movies get a bit too much spoiled in either trailers or pictures from production.,4w86a7
d6507om,Would make sense. DC is so busy playing catch up that they're playing catch up with themselves.,4w86a7
d650tot,"I think it's because he is still mainly a novice at this point from what I've gathered from the Justice League teaser. He's not well known as the Flash yet and not all that connected to the world. Even Capt Boomerang (who traditionally is a Flash Rogue) didn't know who apprehended him.

d67dl9t,"Also what is the timeline here? He has the nice suit in the flashback, while Wayne is still gathering info to build a team?",4w86a7

d657txo,Do you even comics bro?,4w86a7
d65eh0f,Same way how Thor didn't join Team Cap or Team Iron. ,4w86a7

d65p85q,Welcome to the DCMU. Fuck logic.,4w86a7
d66afmm,"ARGUS doesn't have leverage over the Flash, nor a working relationship with him. plus, this wasn't considered a ""world threatening event"" - if you remember, the mission was to go in and retrieve Waller, not stop the terrorists. they decided to stop Enchantress after Waller got shot down. 

so basically, Waller needed to be rescued and she didn't want to ask other people to do it. if Flash or another hero did it, there would be no guarantee that the whole affair would be kept under wraps, as the heroes would probably draw attention to it or want to speak out against government secrecy. publicizing what happened would fuck up Waller's career. she had task force X under her thumb and could ensure discretion.

d67ee3q,"We need a team of bad guys to save us. That way Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, and Aquaman can just be backup.",4w86a7

d66dxlv,Everyone saw what rotten tomatoes said about it and went into the theater and only saw all the bad parts instead of enjoying an awesome action movie.,4w86a7

d66b7ql,CW's is definitely better.,4w86a7
d67d0fs,"One of the major things about the current Flash comic is ""He can't be everywhere at once."" The man has his own stuff to do. He isn't all knowing, and he doesn't have the Justice League (in the movies) yet to let him know if he's needed somewhere.",4w86a7

d676bkx,"It seemed like it was trying to copy from GoG. The problem is that in GoG the songs were all similar in theme, and had root in the movie, in that they came from the tape his dying mother gave him. In SS they just picked a handful of popular songs and threw them in. ",4w86a7

d660c5a,"I'm upset about the Joker backhand and Joker maliciously pushing her out of the helicopter being cut. 

Harley choosing the squad over reviving Joker makes no fucking sense with the scenes we're given showing they're perfectly in love. If they show Joker's abusive, her transition would make more sense.",4w86a7
d65ycfj,"The funny thing to me is the film still kind of adheres to some stereotypes and problematic stuff like the sexualization of like Enchantress and Harley, and the weird BET thing with Croc etc

I'm ok with problematic stuff here and there if it either subverts them or does something interesting with them by going all the way. 

The problem is your left with half assed sexism and racism rather than either going all the way or removing it altogether, so its like, pointless to have dialed it back.

Instead of disgusting vile characters or clean characters you get something kind of half assed in the middle",4w86a7
d65y08y,What it sounds like you mean is that the writers took no advantage of special knowledge of the characters abilities. Almost like the writers didn't know the characters... hmm. ,4w86a7

What did u think about his character?",4w86a7

d68296r,That was really the nail in the coffin for me.,4w86a7
d6qgrau,I think it was showing Joker to be an excellent waterpolo player. He was doing egg beater kicks to keep himself afloat,4w86a7
d66v9t3,He was toying with her.,4w86a7
d65i51k,"You nailed the issue with the antagonist here well. Say what you will about Doomsday, but he didn't have this much of his movie devoted to him. It felt like it was time to check my received text messages when the scenes with the Enchantress and her brother came on.

I will mention, though, that I like the effects on Enchantress earlier on in the film, how it plays with your perception of the scene. By this I mean how the witch's hand comes up from under her hand when she is summoning her at first. Also in the scene where her reflection bashes the male character against the mirror. Minor stuff, but that worked.

I also understand what you mean with the threads of nihilism. The ending with them still incarcerated would've fit with themes like that running throughout the movie. But they botched that up, so the ending feels...wrong, considering that WB tried to make it into more of a traditional superhero movie.

Also, I thought the effects that Diablo did were awesome. I think that there being these surreal (and almost...whimsical) visuals aligned with the darker tones is the best fit for Suicide Squad. But it seems like it only dips a toe in the water there, instead of diving in. ",4w86a7
d65yv08,"What you said about checklists really stands out to me. The film just feels stale and formulaic, like the studio literally said ""you have to have these elements or we bring in another director"" and pushed Ayer up against a wall. I think I'd do a crap job at directing a movie if my hands were tied on the most important story elements from day one.

Also another movie that does ensemble casts and flashbacks really well is The Usual Suspects. The Usual Suspects, however, uses the nature of flashbacks and an unreliable narrator as a storytelling device to manipulate the story to the teller's benefit. I think it would've been super interesting if the story had taken place entirely in that restaurant at the beginning of the film, with Waller sitting down and debriefing some high ranking members of the military on a recent mission by the Suicide Squad, but she manipulates the story to her own benefit. This would have allowed them to both have their exposition and to use it in such a way as to further the narrative, because there's an internal narrative being built and directed by a character that we've already seen is incredibly manipulative, efficient, and self-serving. 

If anything this movie honestly comes off as a much more poorly executed Escape from New York, where you have a somewhat villainous set of characters on a mission to escort someone important out of a dangerous place, and if they succeed they earn their freedom. There's even bombs in the neck, which I thought was an homage before I realized the movie isn't that self-aware. ",4w86a7
d66gu8v,"Probably. The sound for KC was terrible. I know the actor has a thick accent, but damn they could have cleaned up the audio on his dialogue.",4w86a7
d64vl0d,What exactly was the point of having her? To keep them in line? Pretty sure that's what the bombs in their heads were for...,4w86a7
d6502rg,I thought her sword's power was being able to Facetime her husband on it.,4w86a7
d64zckz,"'Ol Rick mentioned that twice, but it had no real impact on the plot at all.  I figured since the writers made a point to mention that the sword steals souls *twice, the end game would be to capture the soul of Enchantress in the sword.  

Nope.  Just a couple of throwaway lines to... I dunno... make Katana seem cooler?  ",4w86a7
d64uwm9,Yeah that was probably the craziest aspect of the whole movie and they just gloss over the fact that her sword can steal fucking Souls. But hey when you start to overthink this movie it really falls apart so it is what it is,4w86a7

THIS IS KATANA",4w86a7

This movie really does sound like a mess.",4w86a7
d655vco,It would have been cool if they resurrected James Brown and gave him a cameo where he was one of the Enchantress' soldiers. Kitana then kills him and he does his trademark James Brown yell as he falls to the grown and he lives in her sword forever as the Godfather of Souls.,4w86a7

d660n4q,"Margot and will were the best actors here, and they have good chemistry (+ previous movie history). Half the squad didn't need to be there. Boomerang could be replaced by a soldier, katana didn't live up to the hype (she was a close combat person who didn't really perform as optimally as she should have), killer croc kinda had 1 purpose (to swim and be corny) & diablo was way too powerful so they just made him sacrifice himself.

Dozens of scenes that had the joker in the trailers just weren't in the film. Honestly he has probably 10-15 lines of dialogue, if not less. And is on camera for 1-2 minutes. Tops. And what Leto seems to be doing with him looks interesting, but there just isn't any material in the film. ",4w86a7

d67a9fn,"That's a good point you got there at Ace chemicals. THAT'S exactly where i wished they would add more depth. To me, I think the dialogue should be a few more lines than would you die for me or would you live for me. I know, I'm just nitpicking things haha I just always had this idea that the Joker sets Harley 'free', so more of an eye opening moment for her where she sees HIS side of things and joined him because she thinks he's right AND also because of love. 

That bit about the thug, it was fun. But since I'm really bad at keeping up when people talk fast, I totally missed why he got shot. I get that scene as them wanting to kill him regardless of his answer? As in, that's how they have fun? 

I agree with you on both points about this version of HQ. That's how i feel as well. Hey, I'm a woman and I don't care how they treat Harley. She's a fucking fictional character for god sake. I think i should note that domestic abuse is nothing to be glorified about (yes, yes, there i said it) - and btw, Harley also abuses Joker whenever she had enough. I'm just rambling. 

I enjoyed the movie even though I had issues with HQ. I think it's definitely a step forward in the right direction from BVS. A fun filled movie, with great characters. I need to watch it again and would def get the DVD.

I'll take actual trained soldiers or warriors with kryptonite weapons over Harley, Croc, Digger, Slipknot, and depending on the weapon Deadshot. And that assumes the threat is kryptonian, if it isn't the squad is completely and utterly worthless.

The way his scenes were edited felt like something out of a Nine Inch Nails video, and he just kind of showed up, no build up to make the audience go 'whoa the Joker!'. He was great in every scene he was in but the way they were sort of scattered throughout you were just left going..what is happening, why is he here?

Look at how Marvel handled Black Panther - he was the coolest thing about Civil War - we didn't need a 10 second backstory exposition dump - we just needed to see him talk to his father to understand everything that drives him - then we get a whole film.

We all heard that Suicide Squad had numerous reshoots to add more humour, possibly in reaction to how well Deadpool was received,  but these reshoots didn't add anything worth a fuck IMO. 

I think when it comes to the criticisms of this film and others like it you're gonna get two camps. In one, you get people who appreciate a well made film by filmmaking standards - good direction, writing, casting, editing etc etc. In the other camp you will get people who are just happy to see their favourite characters brought to life on screen, and even if the film sucks by standard definition, they are gonna score it highly just because of this.",4w86a7

Some people didn't like the 'gangster' feel he had but I quite liked it. Joker runs a crime empire, I always felt Heath Ledgers Joker was too much of a lone wolf to have such a complex network of followers and henchmen. What Leto's Joker missed out was his sociopathic behaviour. He didn't have that complete lack of compassion towards humanity, in fact he didn't really have any motivation.

While I like the depiction of him, he's wasted in terms of plot use. His scenes are unnecessary, if you cut them out of the movie it would not make less sense. That's not something you should ever say of Joker in a movie.",4w86a7

Show us the important ones and the less important ones (slipknot) to mix things up. Hell, blatantly state that a few of them are definitely going to die, have people guessing. At the beginning of the movie you can show them all back to back so that everyone in the theater is on the same level.

Yet no Flash, no Batman, no WW. Just a crew with bullets, knives and bats besting a powerful witch. Props to El Diablo cause he was awesome and I personally loved the Aztec Demon form, but it was the bomb that did the job.

d6902ro,">   Diablo means Devil so seeing him turn into an actual demon makes sense

I mean, it doesn't really make sense to an audience member.  We don't assume Batman is called that because he literally turns into a bat.

Given how the film was depicted I think it's a very common assumption to think he calls himself El Diablo because he can shoot fire.  It's how the movie built him up and never once did it hint at anything supernatural with him.  He's no different than the Flash who is a meta human.

If anything, it's really confusing when he turns into the creature.  If Batman suddenly turned into a huge giant bat while fighting Superman, I don't think I would immediately think he was really possessed by a demon all along and this is his true form.  I would be confused and wondering what the hell the film maker did this for.

Downvote if you want, but it makes no sense to an audience member.  They aren't going to just go 'oh he's actually a possessed devil, of course'.  It's another small sign that these movies are really rushed and not thought out in the slightest.",4w86a7

I thought Harley and Deadshot got a decent amount of development. Diablo got the worst of both worlds, with some decent backstory, but not enough presence in the story to justify his 'family' line at the end. Croc, Boomerang and Katana were kind of non-presences in the film.

Being too nit picky going into films like this is gonna mark you not enjoy them. My largest issue with the film is that they never truly felt like villains. I get that they have this backstory, but it's never applied during the film. ",4w86a7

I don't have a problem with him laying in some knives, but at least give me a reason to think you're something other than a laugher. I think they should have either played up his gangster side or his crazy side but they ended up doing laughing gangster who shoots people instead of being creatively mad.",4w86a7

Adaptation is fine but Ledger's Joker is the way to do it. His Joker was different from the comic counterpart but the core elements were still there.",4w86a7
d65iwzd,"The squad + Waller were the primary characters in the movie, but Joker was definitely the primary secondary character.

He was a bigger part of the movie than I expected going in.",4w86a7
d64zb3l,"I think one of the biggest issues with DC at the moment is they're focusing on getting super stylistic directors (Ayer and Snyder) and not putting together a strong and cohesive group of writers. As a result the films are getting some pretty pictures, but nothing to work with for their script. I think Ayer should have collaborated with someone on this. You can see he has a lot of love for the characters and their various stories, but he was trying too hard to shove everything he could think of about them into it. Which lead to a cluttered mess that didn't allow for the focus to be on any character for more than a few seconds.",4w86a7

d65m68q,"*Guardians of the Galaxy* worked (really well, if I may add) as an ensemble piece that featured characters that have never been in a movie before because one character bumps into another character, who then bumps into another character, rinse and repeat until the entire group is formed. There's a whole journey for all of them to meet up just like with *Star Wars*.

As for *Suicide Squad*? Holy shit! The first 20-30 minutes (or first act, if you will) introduces all these characters with there own music videos. It's just a bunch of separate scenes/segments with a lot of info dumped on us. There's no sense of order, either. Our ""protagonists"" have no interaction with each other until, like, 45 minutes in when they are given their mission. The movie is so slow and takes forever to get to a point; by then, the stakes are so forced and uninteresting.

If *Suicide Squad* wanted to get chaos and madness across for this world they are presenting, Task Force X should have been on their mission within the first 10 minutes. Stop wasting time telling us these characters and their backstory; let us learn about them as the story progresses and they are fighting for their survival.

**EDIT**: Added more to my second (and third) paragraph(s).",4w86a7
d65mv6l,"The difference though was GotG showed us the characters, they didn't spend a significant chunk of their runtime telling us about them like Suicide Squad did. Even in the lineup scene in GotG we had already spent some time with these characters and they briskly gave us a tiny bit of backstory, no flashbacks or anything.",4w86a7
d65mlkh,"GotG had Quill as the main character, Gamora as the secondary character, and Drax, Groot, and Rocket as filler characters. A lot of people thought that, as the case with many Marvel movies, that the villain was kinda ""meh"". So the difference there is that you know for sure who the main character is, any backstory to the other characters doesn't go into any great detail with flashbacks, just snippets of information. Rocket explains I am Groot and all it's meanings, you see Rockets enhancements that made him more than just a normal raccoon, you have the Thanos subplot where he's Gamora and Nebula's father. They're not trying to go into great detail though because they want you to mostly care about Peter Quill. He's the leader, he's the one who got effectively stolen from Earth, who had a big attachment to his mom, who's been this space pirate with these other space pirates....

In Suicide Squad, you have Deadshot and Quinn, you're getting some background, they're trying to flesh the characters out, they want you to care about Deadshot because he has a daughter, but you're making a villain into an anti-hero in too small a frame of time. In the move they're trying to explain how he's the ultra assassin, asshole, so why would he help anyone, to being the guy who saves the day. Thing is, because of all the other characters you have to include, you don't really have time to explore why he'd change his ways aside from, ""i love my daughter""",4w86a7
d65n8sf,"I would say that they DID earn GotG.

Thanos / Infinity Gems (Stones) are a big part of GotG, and they had been set up before in Captain America, Thor, Avengers, Thor 2, and Cap 2. They establish that there are other stones, and they establish that there are other races living waaaaay out in space, which leaves you wondering, where might another stone be, and who might find it?

So before the movie even starts, you're familiar with the world and the villain and the motivations.",4w86a7

That's just off the top of my head. Tons of stupid, cringey dialogue in this flick. I don't know why the fuck DC can't write a script that even remotely feels natural.

Regarding Harley, well, in some adaptations, she is treated that way. I would argue those are some of the worst and most outdated adaptations, but it is true. It doesn't change the fact that the way the film treats her is uncomfortable and just outdated to the point of cringe. It's like watching some early 2000's Michael Bay shit where the women are so fetishized it comes across as bad parody.

I can get behind it not living up to the hype, but I always take a movie as-is rather than comparing it to what I thought it was gonna be. It wasn't like the trailers made it seem, but the movie itself was okay.

I with they could have done something more introductory as their first mission, not ""There's a big bad destroying the world"".

I also wish during the final fight with Enchantress, they could have had more chemistry. They're supposed to be an unorthodox group of people, and I REALLY expected them to combine their various abilities in interesting and ""just happens to work"" ways as they're all fighting Enchantress.

The entire last fight I'm waiting for Croc to fastball special Katana or something, or Boomerang to throw one that curves around a baddie, and deadshot bounces his bullets off the metal boomerage to get around a shield, but it never happened.

This Joker is basically the “clown PRINCE OF CRIME” as opposed to previous incarnations which were more “CLOWN prince of crime.” He looked sort of like the Joker (white skin, green hair, red lips, dark eyes) and sort of not (there’s the much-debated tattoos and the lips which are just ordinary lips as opposed to the traditional elongated smile that Joker usually sports). 

Still, I think Leto has a good read on the character and, with the right material to work with, can really give a great, twisted take on the comic book version. Really the number one thing you want with the Joker is that he command the screen. Leto does that. I couldn't take my eyes off him when he’s on screen and I found myself really digging his almost-growling line deliveries and manic eyes. It’s all very good, there just wasn’t enough of him in this movie.",4w86a7

I didn't love the joker, I don't think he lived up to Ledger or Hamill in any way, however, I feel like part of that was he wasn't given a lot of time to breathe. He was only in the movie comparatively little and I felt like we never got to see Leto flesh the character out a whole lot.

Yes, it ain't magnificent. But isn't utter shit either. Its rather good, actually, a 7/10. Not spectacular but It's a very well made funny popcorn flick. Leave your brain at the door and have fun. You knew you had to do that the moment you walked into a superhero movie. 

Now, if you say ID4:2 is a bad movie then yes, we are on the same page. That was a godawful stinking pile of... It was just a mess, saved a little tiny bit by Goldblum but even he was on autopilot for 90% of the movie. Which was a shame because to fuck that movie up you really had to try. But they did. The casting, the acting, the story...  Highlights where Goldblum and sure, mr Data ;-) knocked the nutty (gay; surprise!) scientist (again) out of the park. But nothing more. 

Oh, I forgot, we where talking about suicide squad. What didn't you like? The Diablo story arc? Slipknot's story arc? (hahaha, all 2 minutes of it) No really good guys, everyone is bad? Enchantress and her strange ass wiggling? The plot holes? Because each and every superhero flick has those. Or do you really think you can lose when the God of thunder is on your team? He's a god. He can end everything just by willing it.  Every Avenger film should be over in 5 secs, If you start to think about it. Here comes Thor. Boom. The End. Roll credits. Because... there are no puny gods. And that's why you leave your brain at the door when watching superhero movies. Now, Bat vs Super was a mess. A beautiful mess (it should have been two movies), but a mess all the same. This isn't. 

I liked the joker. This is more the comic book joker then we've ever had. Nicholson, Ledger, now Leto. Those are big boots to fill, but he did. Even the origin story checked out.(what was the origin of Ledger's Joker? Just a weird anarchistic guy who paints his face and has big scars?)

d65xejo,"> One reason I believe that everyone chooses Marvel movies (i.e. The Avengers) more is because most of those characters had movies before they teamed up

Exactly. WB is doing this ass backwards. 

They should have made Man of Steel, immediately following the aftermath from MoS, they should have made a Batman film where he is trying to learn about Superman. Superman should be in the film but only from Batman's perspective, we don't need Clark or anything else, just little bits of Superman in a Batman movie where he's dealing with Batman things and maybe Jared Leto's Joker, maybe the other Justice League members start to show up little by little in a very subtle way. 

After that movie we get BvS and we actually have the back story of why Batman does not trust Superman. BvS would then be a different movie and the whole focus would be on Batman and Superman dealing with each other as well as local crime. We don't need a Doomsday character, we can do without space aliens. 

Then maybe we have a different version of Suicide Squad which builds up a threat that leads into the Justice League movie. 

It just seems like they went with this all in a backwards way that doesn't make any sense. ",4w86a7

I do kinda think those who aren't comic book fans appreciated the film a little more, but the reviews among my friends were definitely mixed. One of them, who couldn't give less shits for comic book films, thought it was alright. The one extreme comic book fan who probably hyped it more than I did also enjoyed it.

Shakespeare isn't respected for his aimless stories about nothing.bYou're allowed to think this movie is good, but I'm not just guessing when I say that this movie will fade into the abyss, while say; The Dark Knight will be remembered.

This Joker seems willing to go to any lengths to get his Harley back.  If anything, the roles seem to be reversed a bit; one would think, with Harley's professed devotion to the Joker, that she would have hoofed it straight to the crash site and made every effort to find her puddin', alive or dead, rather than just be sitting there pouting and mourning as the rest of the Squad finds her afterwards.",4w86a7

I haven't seen Suicide Squad yet, so I really can't completely write it off or give specific examples from the movie itself as to why I don't like it, (obviously), but as soon as I saw the trailer, I knew it was going to fucking suck.

Why, you ask?  Because the entire premise is goofy as shit.  

Good movies get the viewer emotionally invested in their characters as well as story lines.  How am I supposed to become emotionally invested in the collective fate of a bunch of villains I have been trained to despise throughout every other bit of DC source material?  

Furthermore, it's easy to infer simply from watching the trailer that the movie doesn't know what it wants to be.  

Does it want to be a dark and ominous film with nihilist undertones, or does it want to be a satirical piece filled with sardonic wit?  My point is that those two themes don't mesh well together, and it's not really Snyder's fault because it's obvious that DC is basically forcing him to pump these movies out without any real thought put into them because they are trying to keep up with Marvel.

They get a few rushed movies out of the way, and once they can move away from origin stories, it sets up more complex and interesting story lines.

When dealing with god=level threats, people are GOING to die. As you said, they gave the deaths in MoS so much weight that they needed a whole sequel to account for it. THAT is awesome.

When Waller killed those people, that scene had weight. It showed that she was the true villain of the entire movie. Her mad grab for culminating power, and ensuring she was the one in control of said power, created the the exact conflict she created the task Force to deal with. In that scene she cemented herself as a cold, calculated killer. Flagg recognized it. Deadshot recognized it, and when the rest of the squad realized she was the high priority target they were there to retrieve, they recognized it.

Shit, that was one of the best scenes in the whole movie.

Whereas, the innocents in Enchantress' army, got a two second shout out after they were gunned down, stabbed, and mauled with baseball bats, as Deadshot said ""hey, that's a 3000 dollar watch...is that real person?"" And that.was.it.

d653eeh,"I mean, it's my opinion just as it's yours but I'll elaborate for the sake of healthy discussion. I find this way more entertaining than AoU. Just as AoU didnt make us care about their side characters, SS didn't made us care much for Boomerang, Croc and Diablo. Yet I felt they were better utilized ish (Croc seriously wtf) than Pietro and Wanda. It might had been my low expectations but I seriously don't understand much of the hate. Joker is as much of a cameo as Batman, he will have his time to shine, it could have easily turned into a Joker movie but his purpose was for Harley's origins. His cameo felt like any other comic book too me and I liked it, it wasn't his story he's just there. I liked  how it's not an abusive relationship like previous incarnations and even with my whole vendetta against Will Smith (find him boring), he played a great Deadshot. Smith has this great way of delivering deadpan humor without taking away. It had great comic book spread like scenes and even the whole cliches worked. Sure it has their deus ex machinas but the MCU has just as much. Even Guardians which I love and have easily viewed couple of dozens of times, the whole dancing is just as much deus ex as Harley friends line yet more believable than impromptu dancing.

I seriously can't believe when someone says this is worst than every Marvel movie. As much as I love the MCU (and support by preordering the every movies' best buy steelbooks) there's no way Iron Man 3 and both Thors are better than SS. I enjoyed it a lot  and had fun. I didn't noticed the ""bad editing"" as BvS where I actually left bored after the movie and I can see myself rewatching as opposed to the other Marvel movies I mentioned and I bought/own out of support. I just want both franchises to have great movies. I don't get the whole side thing. I grew up with both, I own comics from both and even Valiant and so on.

i think he took out the brother's heart. it seems like that's how they had to kill the enchantress, makes sense that's how they killed the brother too. diablo does melt through his chest during the fight.

> 5) if Deadshot is doing everything to be with his daughter, then why is his deepest desire dream/fantasy the act of killing Batman, instead of being with his daughter? 

batman took him away from his daughter. i think he was like reliving a moment in his past a different way.

though i kind of get the sense that the visions were more enchantress's doing than their own, and she didn't get it *quite* right. like, these were things they told themselves they wanted, even though they didn't.

diablo wants his family back -- but he really wants to atone for his mistake and rid himself of the devil.

Captain America 2 and Guardians of the Galaxy were awesome though, I also liked Ant Man.

The more clicks, the more cash, which is why every critic has to take an extreme position on every movie they review these days. Every movie is either the greatest of all time or the worst thing ever these days, no middle ground. Journalism is a dying business, you gotta do what you gotta do to get clicks.

Just look through a standard RT page and look at the outlets, who honestly give a shit about outlets like these?

Literally any nobody with a blog can get their review on RT",4w86a7
d66c66s,"I loved Suicide Squad. Whilst it had flaws, I found it infinitely more entertaining than both of the Avengers movies. Great characters, decent story and the ultimate test - I would buy it on bluray to watch again. I think a lot of the reason this movie is getting hate is because we as an audience have become accustomed to the 'Marvel style' of making hero movies - this is a different animal and deserves to be judged as one.",4w86a7
d6694br,"No one wants to make there own opinion I think everyone is just following the critics.
",4w86a7
d66eynw,Yup that guy ,4w86a7
d67nmmv,"I think a lot of people misunderstand what the rotten tomatoes score actually means; it's the % of critics that gave the movie a negative review, whether that is a 5/10 or a 1/10. It is being misinterpreted as all the critics giving it a 2.8 score, which obviously isn't what the film deserves (it's bad, but not *that* bad). So then the masses hate on the critics, because even if the viewer thought the movie wasn't terrible, that opinion clearly isn't shared with those 'stuck-up critics'.",4w86a7
d67pdqu,"Since Rotten Tomatoes works on a yes/no system, if most critics say no, it's going to be a super low score, even if it's only just barely but clearly a no.

It could be like a 4.5 movie, but you're not going to recommend a 4.5 movie to your friends ever, so the RT score is going to be way lower.",4w86a7
d6809wi,"I'm not sure what your criticism of critics are here, lower their expectations for comic book films? Critics don't ask for every film to be revolutionary pieces of art, they just want them to do the basics right, create interesting characters, a sensible and involving plot, drama, etc. This film did none of that.

d651is2,"Harley was in the scene - so Joker would have no reason to take the copter yet.   I believe the scene was to show how ""important"" Harley was to him though one could infer that from the chemical bath scene or several others so...  really just another Joker is kooky scene.",4w86a7
d652djq,"The person in charge to putting music in this movie really screwed up too.

Its pretty sad that they told everything, but the dialogue was terrible.  It felt like they were trying to force shitty one liners the entire time.  Also the action sequences were a snooze.

I feel really bad for Will Smith.  I was rooting for the movie to be good, and he was obviously trying, but he had nothing to work with.

They definitely tacked on the joker for the movie in the name of the ""cinematic universe"", which would be a generous term for the 3 films we have gotten so far.",4w86a7
d651vkk,"Ugghhh I fucking hate ""show, dont tell"" violating. Was a huge part of why I thought this last season of Game of Thrones was terrible. I'll probably see it and with an open mind and will have no problem admitting if I liked it, but I have a feeling I'll end up just enjoying agreeing with the negative reviews. Hopefully Half In The Bag does a review.",4w86a7

d66os5o,"Well I haven't seen it yet, but the trailers looked like terrible shit.

I'll go see it for the same reason I saw ""GhostBusters"". To give it a fair shake and judge it based on my criteria of what makes a movie enjoyable.

But even the ""fun"" trailers looked like shit.

I was bummed the moment they didn't get C. C. H. Pounder to play ""The Wall""

I liked the suicide squad comics, I liked the animated versions.

DC should just stick to TV and Animation. Its what they seem to do best now. (The Killing Joke Excluded)

I felt uncomfortable watching him, which is how I feel like I'm supposed to feel around him.

I loved Heath Ledger's Joker, but he almost seemed too put together and not manic enough.",4w86a7
d678l4i,"I'm sure he did good, Will's generally a good actor. But yeah that was my point, I had read a while ago that he wasn't wearing the mask most of the movie. Million dollar stars don't wear masks. Which is why they ruin movies based on stuff that involves masks. Dredd was a pleasant surprise. They were apparently gonna do a few scenes of Karl Urban without the helmet and he being a huge Dredd fanboy was like go die in a fire.",4w86a7

d67l8fy,"Most definitely. The scene between her and Bruce shows that she's specifically trying to keep the details of Midway City protected so she doesn't lose her career nor the Suicide Squad.

d69cwiq,"I don't think it's necessary, but I think the biggest difference would be blood.  Allowing them to kill people instead of monsters.  Killer Croc would have been a lot better if he ran into a group of people and just started munching away.  The Joker too for that matter.",4w86a7

d66hko7,"Cause when it comes to a dc movie they are looking for flaws, but when it is marvel they all just ignore all that shit and worshiped it because it is marvel movie. Then if you point that out, you are just a DC fan.

If you compare Suicide Squad to Jason Bourne movie of this year, the former is better movie there is an character development and actual plot while Jason Bourne felt like an unnecessary sequel. It's a good movie, but has some flaws and lacking aspects. It's like Big Hero 6 were some characters are not given proper screen time, and has a not bad plot, yet, Suicide Squad is more hated.
",4w86a7
d66xzy9,The downvotes also shows this people are liars. They can't handle the truth.,4w86a7
d67elu1,"I agree. But the thing is that a lot of the people who didn't like the movie, didn't just *not* like the film. They are saying things like they thought it was pure garbage. This is what is so strange because there are dozens of movies just like this one (I admit that SS is very reminiscent of many other typical summer action flicks) that people responded to with far less vitriol. So why are they so hard on the mistakes this movie made, and not the mistakes in other similar movies? I really feel like people let their expectations run wild, and the DCCU doesn't exactly have the kind of brand loyalty of something like Star Wars which can get way with remaking an older movie, pitching it as a sequel with hokey dialogue and still be considered a success that met expectations. 

I don't know what people expected out of this movie beyond what we got. I mean, yeah it was heavily marketed but WB has always done that with their comic book movies. I remember Batman with George Clooney having a ridiculous amount of marketing - that's just how WB rolls.

It was tons of fun and all of my 10+ friends who went to see it loved it or liked it at least. No one disliked it so I don't get why the hate is so severe",4w86a7
d66fheg,"Well that's not a fact, that's an opinion. One that most critics and audience members agree on, true. I love GotG I'm just saying there are parallels between these two films and I don't think Squad misses the mark as badly as some are saying when viewed objectively. Further, I think in 5-10 years time ppl will change their view on this film. It'll most likely be a cult classic. Now that's just MY opinion, I could be 100% wrong",4w86a7
d66dr9u,"I think both stories ""made sense"" within the universes they had created. In GotG it made sense for Peter Quill to have a dance off distraction at the climax. In this film I think it made sense that Joker utilized texting and iPads. My point: IMO they're both sound in their own universes. I'm not seeing how Squad is forced given the world it created ",4w86a7
d66e4k1,"I'm with you, I just noticed a lot of similarities between the two. I preferred Squad to Guadians because they are more villainous. It was refreshing to see baddies and not just the cutsie ""wink, wink we're a little good and a little bad"" that GotG had",4w86a7

d66e9bf,"No, not at all.  The normal viewer ratings are retarded since they're only from people who visit the site and feel compelled to rate things on it, which should be enough of an indication that it's meaningless.  Critics are fine, but an aggregated percentage of all critics' reviews is meaningless, at least in a vacuum.  100% of people can say that one movie is just 'ok' and 75% of critics can call another movie a groundbreaking masterpiece while the other 25 just doesn't get it, and according to the percentages alone, the first movie is considerably superior.",4w86a7

d6839qh,"Civil War is literally the same thing as Batman V Superman. I enjoyed it and thought it was good...nothing extremely spectacular though. Iron Man was a smart ass, Cap was fun, but my favorite part was seeing Spider-Man finally getting involved!

Are you telling me that you can't see how some people would be bothered by an incoherent story, or useless characters, or action that wasn't particularly varied?

As far I was I liked in particular? Harley Quinn and the Joker in particular. Those two on screen together are fantastic. Has me excited for a Batman solo film much more than anything else. In fact, the origin reboot of Quinn and the Joker at Ace Chemicals would have got me in the door itself. And I don't see where the characters ""didn't mesh"". They're a group of villians. Chemistry isn't exactly a strong suit, even in the comics. Suicide Squad was an interesting storyline put in place to give villians more spotlight.

And Katana is basically there to establish that this is a world with metahumans in it, some of them working for the government. This is one of their allies. Boomerang and Croc didn't get any dream sequences or any kind of backstory really, but they're the funny guys. 

The main focuses were Harley, Deadshot, El Diablo, and Flagg. They didn't really go too deep with anyone else. But then again, they didn't have much depth, and I don't know that every side character and supporting character needs depth. 

The story itself wasn't really focused, I don't think, but that's because it wasn't important, I don't think. They did jump around from thing to thing until Joker showed up and then they jumped around from more things, but the mission/story itself was supposed to take a backseat to the character dynamics. Particularly between our major four.",4w86a7
d65r4nb,"About the editing, was the problem with the editing that it interrupted the mission with flashbacks/backstory? Because I think that was intentional. The mission wasn't really the story. The mission was a framing device so that we could see clips and characterization from the team.

Speaking of teams, I think the Avengers went into the makeup of each Avenger even without the solo movies. But some more than others. Hawkeye didn't get any development until Avengers 2, but does he really need any right now, or is it okay for him to be more of a supporting character?

Also, how good does a villain need to be? In End Of Watch, the villain was the streets themselves, and the streets themselves weren't actually a character.",4w86a7

When even Leto himself complains about how much his scenes [were edited out](http://variety.com/2016/film/news/suicide-squad-jared-leto-joker-scenes-cut-deleted-1201831587/) it's hard to really give opinion.",4w86a7

His love. He was in love with June. But we have no information on why. We have way more information on Enchantress, and it's looking pretty good. 10/10 would tap dat satanic ass.

Her surviving against all odds is even more cliche. I just feel like it would've worked better if June just discovered the Enchantress and then died. We have her heart, why do the characters need a second method of control as well? And the heart didn't even seem to do much, she just did whatever the fuck she wanted. 

Overall, I would've really liked to see the really dark evil witch fighting as a part of the Suicide Squad. I have seen little to no dark magic on the side of the good guys in fiction. When she teleported over to the army guy and touched his neck and he said ""Don't touch me"", that was quick and hilarious. So much more potential there, with her competing with Harley for being the group seductress. 

From the heart and her immortality, she was kind of like a lich. That would've blown everything else out of the water if they had a lich on their side, there isn't a piece of fiction that exists with a lich on the good side. ",4w86a7

Reflecting on the cast more, it's funny that at the time I would've sworn Aries Spears would be doing the most work now. Looking at his page, he's done almost nothing... I guess my point was MADtv hasn't seemed to benefit any of the old casts' careers, unlike even some mediocre SNL members.",4w86a7

As for the Joker/Batman scene well thebstory itself and that Joker don't make sense. The Batman cameo looked bad and cheesy. Like this is how people feared Batman would turn out in BvS because something about his cameo looked wrong.

Deadshot and Harley were pretty well played spot on, and Diablo and Croc really didn't have much room to grow. (And let's not even talk about what they did with boomerang... what the hell was the deal with the pink unicorn fetish?!?!) 

But it seemed like every opportunity they had with Flag they fucked it up. They kept on having to rescue him every fight and he backed down against Waller and caved in and smashed his kill switch when he started to feel guilty. Oh, and then there's the 'I'm not a hugger...' scene. 

The only thing he did right in pretty much the whole movie was crush the Enchantresses heart and then he gets rewarded with his girlfriend coming back to life.

It's difficult to illustrate that in films and such, but that is the entire idea behind it. I've always loved [this scene](https://youtu.be/BIaF0QKtY0c?t=24) from Christopher Reeve. When he takes the glasses off and becomes Superman, he's taller, he isn't hunched and reserved. He's confident. His voice is deeper. He isn't timid anymore.

For instance, if you wanted a more powerful scene at the end with Deadshot and his daughter, you make enchantress make an ""illusion"" (michael, tricks are for hoola hooping whores) of Deadshot pointing his gun AT his daughter. 

Make him make a tough choice, or at least add something of weight. It makes no sense that she says ""if you shoot this, we can't be together"" unless that means their going to die after he shoots the bomb (which if they did, would seem fitting as they are the ""suicide squad""...but that doesn't work for WB as they want an ""avengers"" competitor) 

Point is, the writing was cheesy, and it affected the overall pacing of the film...in the immortal words of Sy Ableman from the film *A Serious Man*, ""Let it breathe. Ten minutes. Letting it breathe, so important.""",4w86a7

d65fhr9,"Even if you watch The Avengers as a standalone though, you can understand it. It made watching the solo films wholely unnecessary. The first couple scenes after Loki steals the scepter are all introduction for each character. But these scenes flow, and they don't include anything unnecessary. We don't see the *origins* of these characters, we see who they are now and what they can do. Then they can assemble against the villain established in the cold open, argue a bit, grow up a little, and ultimately defeat him.

I'd say The Avengers is the golden example of how to make an ensemble superhero film. Suicide Squad's introduction of our ""heroes"" is comparatively poor. They had Amanda Waller tell us everything at dinner, and then they told us some more as we moved into the plot, breaking up the flow. Meanwhile the villain's plan hardly makes any sense. Loki took the Earth to get back at Thor. He is a brother with an inferiority complex. He also isn't destroying it, he is occupying it and the Chitauri are rounding up civilians. Enchantress was making a machine... But then it was a spell, and she basically just wants the end of the world from what I could tell.  We even get more background (most of it redundant save Harley Quinn) with the Enchantress' visions right before the big fight. ",4w86a7

Instead we got 3 helicopter crashes and some generic fights against the same swamp monsters in Bland City.

Harley has Joker, Deadshot has his daughter, EL Diablo and his family, Bommerang and his unicorn, Katana and her husband, Rick and June. Movies are cinematic jourmeys, if movies were always about story then they would just be books, its a visual medium at the end of the day and as long as the characters stick then there shouldn't be a problem. There are too many movies where nothing happens, 12 Angry Men rings a bell.

d65wx7t,"This is what Marvel is doing right. Before the Big Group movie they did a bunch of individual movies that gave everyone their backstory and motivations.

Always much crappier - bad story, bad animation - but that attempted to make up for it by signing big names to voice the parts. Sharon Stone and others in Antz (their copy of Bug's Life), Will Smith in Shark's Tale, released right after Finding Nemo. 

That is what DCEU currently is to Marvel Studios.",4w86a7
d65jnpu,"as others have mentioned - a simple plot that aped 'assault on arkham' would have been fine, they were after a USB stick that another villain who was tricky and kind of metahuman had - so waller had to use meta humans to get it. Or even, waller was so badass she thought she could get away with using her unapproved team in silence before it blew up in her face. A dozen less contrived scenarios could be used. 

on top of that, i personally liken this movie's general structure to 'Smokin Aces' - which was a good try to an ensemble crime drama. But even in Aces, the origin stories had to be kept really tight, and really short in order for the wrap-up to work and for everyone to meet up and do their thing. Even with that, they had to shoehorn in exposition at the end where they narrated who/what/when/where - and it was SUPER RUSHED as an ending. 

It just goes to show (per your point) that they should have just cut out all the detailed origins like Dirty Dozens - it's the better version of the ensemble formula. Others have tried it before, and it hasn't worked. ",4w86a7
d65l3oa,"In regards to your last two paragraphs, I havent seen SS, but i feel qualified enough to give this opinion:

I feel like the issue is that DC doesn't have a unified plan of how to get from one movie to the next. You can totally do a DCCU without 10 years of build-up and 6 films. If I understand things correctly, they're trying to push towards their Series defining Big Bad Guy in the same style as Apocalypse and Thanos. That's fine. And it's equally fine if they want to build up into the Justice League along the way. Totally workable plot. So working backwards, you need some way for that event to come into being and if you really want a Suicide Squad movie to match Guardians then you should work SS into the overall plan. Then mix in the studio demanding a huge blockbuster film that will generate a lot of hype with minimal effort.

So one option would be to make the Government an antagonist. You could have SS turn into a hybrid part batman part SS heist movie where the government completes their objective but Batman ends up face to face with Waller by the end of it confronting her, which is where she could lay out the government's argument for self protection from Meta/Super people. The ""Martha"" moment could instead be someone showing each other than their Casus Belli was based on mistaken information. Maybe batman isn't executing criminals in prison, maybe it's part of a concerted effort to make Batman look like he's a crazed vigilante who has gone off the deep end in Metropolis (if you want to keep them right next door).

So for this, a batman vs Superman movie wouldn't really work as the first. It might be better suited as the sort of lead in to a justice League movie, where the government sets up the two heavyweights to go after each other (preferably by appealing to their individual personalities) in order to get to the next step of their plan (a government controlled meta/super being that is loyal to the government). Hell, having a crappy meatsack villain could actually work here, and you could even use it to have batman get riled up about Superman. What would Batman do if Superman couldn't beat Doomsday with just his fists and instead lobotomized him? That's the kind of precedent that I could see pushing Batman towards extreme action.

Of course something has to come before that film, so in theory you could do a batman solo film (crime thriller?) where he's involved in an escalating case that points towards the next movie (BVS or something else).

Probably too much, but I think if DC had taken a year or two more and really hashed out the overall plot structure through multiple films, they could have had something special. Now it just seems to be coming off like they're desperate to beat Marvel to the punch and are doing a half-assed job at it.",4w86a7

My working theory is he'd look like a big joke until the climax of his story where he's all fucked up, but he's also in classic joker fashion fucked everything up according to plan. Maybe his hair is a little disheveled, his tone becomes a little more serious, he's spitting blood, and the audience is left wondering if this is the same clown they've been watching the entire movie, and if he's wearing a mask now, or if he was wearing a mask before, or perhaps he was never wearing a mask at all. Nope. Joker was as shallow as the rest of the movie. Still got hope if they decide to utilize him later, which I doubt unless there's a SS2. 

Harley and Deadshot were truly the highlight of the movie. I wanna say that this movie would've been better if it was a day in the life of Harley, with the other characters being secondaries. Deadshot could've been her movie companion, but the others truly didn't have enough room to grow.

That kind of thing.

d68vlni,"this is one of the biggest problems with the film.  With the exception of Diablo, the entire suicide squad is mismatched in power level to the antagonist, making their victory seem untenable and ridiculous.  And you're right-there's no reason why the Flash, WW, and Batman wouldn't get involved.  The fact that they're clearly active in the movie makes it even worse.  Was it like that in the comics? I was under the impression that the suicide squad was primarily for special forces type missions and not to combat the baddest villians of all time.  Kind of like a superhero dirty dozen",4w86a7
d650vtk,"I hated that awful look the moment the picture came out and I still hate his laugh. The only scene it sounded great was during the 'chemical wedding' after they kiss. It was like a 'we're gonna tear up this world' laughter. All the other times he does it, it doesn't fit in with the character. It feels more of a thing he does because he doesn't have anything to say rather than the other Joker iterations that played off reactions, tics, spontaneity.

Looking back at every incarnation of the character, this might be the worst version yet.",4w86a7

d67asiv,"Boomerang has a spy boomerang, and an bomb boomerang. He's got cool toys too.

d6768n4,"Boomerang I'm not sure, he did show off some pretty handy boomerangs, I'd put him at hawkeye level.

And Harley only took out Enchantress with the use of a superpowered weapon, not her baseball bat. If anything, they showed that the normal people had no shot against Enchantress and really only won by a con/fluke. 

I'm cool with all of it either way. I'm not really looking to start a DC/Marvel fight or anything. I was just saying it's a common comicbook thing. ",4w86a7

First of all, I was laughing my ass of during that point in the movie and second of all why even show that clip?!?! It has no use in the movie whatsoever, as did 98 percent of the movie btw lol, and the actor said it in the most mundane way ever.

First Class had plenty of potential for a follow up, and Singer just ignored all of that. ""Um... Yeah that huge build up towards Magneto's bad ass group... Forget about all of that.  Anyone not needed in my sequel is dead or captured. Also... Despite this supposedly being Professor X, he doesn't have telepathy, has a full head of hair, and oh yeah he can walk.

That seems like a better system here than ""hey I'm random internet guy, take my opinion on this movie!"" I also felt the same way about most of the movies, so I'd probably like Suicide Squad also.

Theres no reason WW or Flash couldnt help. Ill give Aquaman a pass because he is not fighting crime on Earth yet and after the JL trailer, seems like he would refuse. Cyborg may not yet be ready to fight so hes forgiven ",4w86a7

d66lhds,"Or maybe people just have an opinion?

I went to BvS and SS with very low expectations because of the critics. BvS surprised me cause it was not as bad as people said, but SS was even more disapointing than i expected.

Good for you if you enjoyed it but if you think it was ""awesome"" then you have pretty low expectation about what an action movie should be.

I'm used to Harley being like that especially with the likes of the Arkham games, but Enchantress was just too in your face trying to be sexy. I was hoping the actor playing her brother was going to have a similar, skimpy outfit but no, he was CGI-ed character.

Are we supposed to be happy that Diablo broke his vow against violence? 

Are we supposed to root for Harley and Joker to get together?

Why was Katana introduced so late, and with a similar flashback despite she was part of Flagg's group and not the SS. Why does Katana follow the SS into the bar for that matter? 

Why doesn't the US military just hit the train station with a cruise missile? 

What is the motivation for *any* SS character to continue to the train station and risk their life after they're given their freedom?

Are we supposed to root for or against Waller?

What exactly did Joker and Harley jump into (acid?) - there doesn't seem to be any negative consequences except for their clothes. 

Why couldn't Batman, Flash (who is supposed to be in Chicago), or Wonder Woman have done anything to *save the world* in the three days that Enchantress was destroying Chicago?

BvS made a little more excited, but also a little more worried. By that point they should have realised what they needed to do and what their own formula was. I figured one more film is all they needed and I was looking forward to Suicide Squad.

Suicide Squad now has me *very* worried. It should have been better, they should have stuck to one theme/formula, they should have pushed a few boundaries. I was entertained but I wasn't impressed. I'm now more worried than excited for the rest of the DC universe.

However, the *only* reason I'm still hopeful for at least Wonder Woman is simply this; **they** ***cannot*** **afford to fuck up the first modern female-lead superhero movie**. They just can't. If they do, they're done. At first DC was supposed to distance themselves from Marvel by being darker and grittier, but 3 movies in and that has been shown to not be enough when shitty editing and non-cohesive plots drag them down. So in my opinion their whole cinematic universe's success hinges on Wonder Woman being good.

If they fuck up Wonder Woman, I will no longer be excited at all. I'll still watch them, I'll still pay to see them in theatres (because I'm a sucker), but my faith will be broken.

*  Captain America:  Nothing happened in present day.
*  Avengers...
*  Iron Man 3:  This movie was an issue.  Thor can be explained as they had not fixed the bridge yet but there is no excuse for Cap and Shield to be absent.
*  Dark World:  The Elves are on Earth for only a brief time and they are in England.  There was no time for Stark or Cap to get there.  Agents of Shield didn't even get there until well after the fight.
*  Winter Soldier:  Shield collapsed and Cap went off grid.  The whole Avengers thing basically went out the window as an arm of Shield.  The Helicarriers were in the air for a short period of time and no one knew Hydra had control.  Maybe Cap and Natasha should have reached out to him but, again, it is never really shown.

d65wnql,"> he just kind of showed up, no build up to make the audience go 'whoa the Joker!'

[You mean a buildup like this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zyhQjJ5UgY)

To be fair though, The Dark Knight Joker was a perfect storm. His story was great, he was a constant threat and even when he wasn't on screen and just his music played that was enough to build tension. 

I haven't watched the movie yet, I'll probably go this weekend, but I just don't care enough right now to try that hard. So I'm curious to know what you thought about the score for the film. Did the Joker have a good musical theme? Obviously I don't think anything could come close to the theme Hans Zimmer wrote. That music is just so intense and if you listen closely to the hits in the song, it literally sounds like someone being slashed up with a knife. You can hear the sound of the knife going through skin. It's a disgusting theme and probably one of the best villain theme of all time in my opinion. ",4w86a7

I also think it suffered because a lot of the exposition centered around Harley Quinn, who just wasn't an interesting character no matter how much time the spent on her.

The villain thing is the most frustrating thing to me so far. They took Lex Luthor and the Joker and removed any sort of cold calculating nature and made them over the top crazy, then blended it with actors who try too hard. The two most well known villains of the DC-verse are going to be difficult to reign back in, and that makes the franchise fight an uphill battle.",4w86a7

1. Available 
2. Could get there in time
3. Would actually be useful to the task
4. Knowledge of the situation


IM3? Tony was playing dead and Cap wouldn't have been that useful anyway. All went down in a couple hours.

TWS? The only possible movie you can almost make the case for but again Cap playing dead and the goal was to simply shut the carriers down. Once all hell broke loose he was a little busy to call Tony. Plus the protect Bucky angle.

GotG? Do they even know who Tony is?

Antman? Very clearly stated too much bad blood between Hank and Tony. Plus what good would the Avengers be on a stealth heist?



Squad was a 3+ day event and Flash has already been established as being capable of TRAVELING BACK IN TIME.

I liked it, cus it showed that while they are bad guys, it's not like they have zero morals or principles. Deadshot and Harley were bonding and getting along well with each other. She wasn't some random mob informant he didn't know, he actually wanted her to escape. He'd probably be fine with anyone escaping if they could find a way out.

Meanwhile Waller comes up to him and orders him to kill her, expecting him to do it just cus he's a hitman and should have no moral qualms about taking a life, which is kinda insulting to him.

He had to strike then, he knew Deadshot wouldn't do anything and used that against him, but made it clear he didn't want to do it then.)

You should check out the comics or if you don't want to, you can learn about all the Robins with Wikipedia. It's really interesting stuff and also heartbreaking.

It was all pretty vague and they didn't actually explain the whole Infinity Gem thing until halfway through GotG, so if you weren't familiar with the comics you wouldn't really think anything of it.

d657qpd,"That's not really a contradiction. Flagg already showed he was disturbed by Waller's methods, but he's worked with her long enough to know that those are her methods. Waller has a huge reputation for being that much of a cold person. A contradiction here would be Flagg pulling a gun on Waller for killing them. And he has a problem with Deadshot because Deadshot literally does kill simply for money while Flagg usually has to kill as part of his job as a soldier.

And why do we need to know why they were there? Waller says they were liabilities, implying that they were either randomly assigned to her, or she had to work with personnel who weren't supposed to know about her secret operation.",4w86a7

The Joker is extremely abusive, for fuck's sake. That's the whole reason why we sympathize with Harley in the first place. And in this movie you have Joker weirdly moping and pining for her throught the whole thing. Mark Hamill's Joker would laugh at how soft-hearted and kind to Harley this guy is.

Characters don't make a whole lot of sense. Why does Harley suddenly abandon ""living for"" the Joker to help out these friends she's had one drink with? Oh yeah, because they cut all the scenes that show Joker's an abusive boyfriend.

Why does ultimate soldier Rick Flag who talks about perseverance suddenly give up and let a bunch of serial killers free?

Why does Amanda Waller even have to make him get with Enchantress anyway? Aren't soldiers supposed to obey orders regardless?

Why didn't Rick Flag or Amanda Waller, who kills people just for seeing things they're not supposed to, kill Boomerang and Harley for their attempted escapes? I'm assuming Waller didn't kill Deadshot for his insubordination because Deadshot was tied for most useful member of the team with Diablo.

I have critical lenses. Funny enough, before making my living writing fiction, I made it as a freelance film critic (covered other entertainment, but mostly film). 

Are there really plot formulas like that? Formulas that are objectively deemed to be more effective? You make it sound so narrow and it's truly not. It's incredible what hits and what doesn't in the world of entertainment. There isn't one sure fire or better way. The Dark Knight is remembered BECAUSE it was such a departure (in some ways...it's quite formulaic in others, but folks have rose colored glasses with that particular movie). 

You see, people use the word opinion because it's just that...an opinion. If you try to set up all of these shaky definitions of what the set formula for any given piece of art is, you're just begging for it to get knocked down. I can name you shows with the exact opposite formula of Breaking Bad that are fan favorites and will be remembered. Same with The Dark Knight. 

Who is right?

If I point to Terrence Malick or Nicolas Refn and say their use of visual narration is as strong as anything written and spoken by the characters of Mamet can you objectively prove me incorrect? Can you demonstrate why one is a better formula? No. It's impossible.

Waller sets up the Suicide Squad IN CASE something happens where they have to use metahumans to solve a problem... and for whatever reason Batman is busy. Surprise! That's exactly what happens.

Flag falls in love with Dr. Enchantress lady after she was infected (?) but for some reason this means he keeps her a secret from the rest of the team, even though none of them know who the fuck either of them are....

d66a57c,"Marvel's films aren't always great, but they're at least competent enough not to have any glaring mistakes that ruin the experience. They have direction, the dialogue and characters are very well written, and the editing is fluid. The only things really lacking are consistently good music (but at worst it's only forgettable) and cinematography (both areas that BvS actually excelled at).

Marvel has a well-oiled engine of groundwork followed by payoff. IM2 and AoU had some problems, but we forgive them because they laid out essential plot points that pay off in The Avengers and Civil War. Warner Bros is rushing at a break neck pace and the result is that the plots are a mess and the characters aren't developed.

The contrast between Civil War and BvS is incredible; the drama carries so much more weight when the characters have history and established personalities. The crazy action is believable when it started out grounded in reality. Compare the introduction of Black Panther and Spider-Man to how Wonder Woman and the Justice League were teased, the former got much more screen time and got to establish their personalities and felt like a natural part of the plot. Pepper doesn't even appear, but she still has so much more of an effect on Tony than Lois had on Superman.

Look at how sympathetic Tony and Steve Rogers are when they explain their views to each other and try to avoid fighting, while Supes and Batman don't make any attempt to resolve their differences and fight with the weakest pretenses. Look how easy it is to follow the plot when attention is given to editing, and you don't mix flashbacks and time traveling together. Look at how unfocused and badly paced the plot is when it tries to cram together plots that Marvel would've spread out over two or three films.

There's no bias towards Marvel. The difference between Warner Bros and Marvel Studios is just that enormous.",4w86a7

d68vhqu,"If you know anything about storytelling, this movie conveys bad storytelling. There's a lot of holes in the plot and a lot of inconsistencies within the established rules for the universe. There were two characters developed in any meaningful way -- Harley Quinn and Deadshot. Everyone else was completely two dimension and basically got a baseball card's worth of development. Slipknot didn't even get a baseball card. 

I like a lot of things about this movie, but as someone with a basic understanding of what makes a good story, this movie doesn't deliver in that way. It doesn't have much substance. 

The editing was also really bad. Scenes seemed to just happen, and they'd happen way too fast. Scene/black cut to next scene/scene/black cut to next scene. It wasn't organic. Like the events wouldn't play out. They'd give you just enough information to let the plot thicken a little bit, but you never saw the actors really having a good time or getting the juices flowing. The editing with music was really awful too. Music in a film should fit the basic vibe of what is happening on the screen, and it should be more of a transitional tool for one scene to another. Or maybe a really powerful moment in the film where words aren't needed. In this movie, scenes with music were more like music videos as opposed to music being used as a transitional tool to match the visuals or to match a powerful visual moment. 

Like I said, there's stuff I really enjoyed in this movie, but saying the story and editing were bad is fair game. The story and editing were bad. The visuals and performances were excellent, though. 

Believe it or a not, there's a science to good storytelling. And it's very open ended, and there aren't a lot of rules. Within those few rules, you can do and say whatever you want. But if you want a story that appeals to and intrigues most people, there's a science to it.

OK, [Miss Cleo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Cleo) - since you think you can read over 700 people's mind...  Let's see if math can too.  

You disagree with 708 people's vote to score the movie 1/10 and you want to toss it.  We can calculate whether the 1/10 score is an outlier, thus skewing the results.  I pulled these scores from the poll and used them as input data:  708,221,418,550,685,863,1075,781,207,203

You can use SPSS, R, or even a spreadsheet to play with these numbers.  There are also a number of online statistical calculators you can use.  Enter the data above into this [outlier calculator](http://graphpad.com/quickcalcs/grubbs1/) and see what it tells you.

In this particular dataset, 700 participants voting for 1/10 is not calculated to be an outlier.  What I see is that the distribution of participation in the poll is normal, meaning there is no score that is over or under represented.  In short, over 700 out of 5700 participants think the movie is dog shit.  

If you take a look at a histogram of the scores, it could be argued that perhaps a large number of people have a strong negative reaction to the movie.  The majority of the respondents fall in the middle range of scores and there are very few people with a strong positive response.

First, you do understand one of the major criticisms of the marvel universe if that weak villains?

Second, my biggest issue with the villian was the fact that he had this weird whipping tail thing that looked AWESOME.  And then, in the fight, he uses it once?  Once?  ONCE?  Just stupid.

Third, everyone liked harley quinn ... this was not called ""Harley Quinn - the movie.""  Yes, she was a good character.

Fourth, you liked the joker?  Why?  You're in the small, small minority there.  Curious why you thought it was good?  Personally I think it was and will be entirely forgetable.

Seventh, no-one here is comparing this to academy award films.  If we're on this thread we KNOW what to compare it against.  And based on what this should and could have been, it was very sub-par.

I think when the majority of the characters have a buildup and you know their back story it's fine to have a couple who are more mysteries but doing that with every character and then relying on flashbacks to tell their story just seemed rushed and took me out of the movie.

I didn't see End of Watch so I cant compare it but I think a villain is a huge part of a movie as they're the conflict that captivates the audience and gives motivation to the protagonists.

d66l8nj,"I hope the extended cut is better, but my hopes aren't too high. BvS wasn't massively improved by its extended cut, and the issues with the film are big enough that I don't think an extended cut could save them.

But at least it could mean us getting to see more of The Joker so that's a plus!

I wish the film had done a better job of the whole team dynamic and had them interact in interesting ways. I always look at Firefly as an example of how to have a team of people interacting whilst maintaining and building very different personalities.

This movie deserved a better writer.",4w86a7
d64xfn3,"Yeah.  I really feel like they are rushing to compete with marvel.  It took them several years to establish the now Avengers characters with standalone movies.  Now they are wanting to introduce Flash, WW,AquaMan, and Cyborg in two hours.  A FlashVBoomerang movie would be cool.",4w86a7
d67rvkt,"oh the dialogue was pretty bad throughout the movie not just her wife or him. Yes the movie has a lot of those problem and I agree but what I was trying to say is that there really isn't a problem with being a stereotypical character, as long it's still a good fleshed out character. Being Stereotypical it's different from being racist",4w86a7
d66umz6,"Why are they fighting Enchantress?! They're portrayed as the only people that totally whoop Enchatress' ass! Except WHERE'S FLASH? OR WONDER WOMAN?! 

Those two are better equipped and could've dealt with Enchantress way faster. 

""But FondleMyButtox, then we wouldn't have a movie!"" YEAH YOU WOULD! You send them on a mission, one that they can actually manage as a team. Fighting Enchantress is lame and she's way overpowered for them. How is Harley Quinn NOT DEAD? Or Captain Boomerang? They're not even ""Meta-Human!"" 

You send them on a smaller, contained mission, that has absolutely NO CORRELATION TO FANT4STIC! They're on this mission, and Joker finds out that Harley is out, comes after her, and fucks the mission to shit! For the rest of the movie you deal with the Joker! Ez money! Ez FUN movie.",4w86a7

d66bpz7,They critique film making. SS was a great example of terrible film making. Don't need to be a critic to figure that out,4w86a7
d66omoy,Then explain why your opinion matters to others?,4w86a7
d66ostv,"See I am the complete opposite. I have no interest of ever watching DOJ ever again,  not even the Ulitamate Cut because it was so boring to me. I read both DC/Marvel and love everything Batman and loved Afleck as Bats, but the movie just did nothing for me. 

I also know that liking a certain movie is someone's preference and enjoy reading all opinions. ",4w86a7

d68r8p4,"Okay, my bad. But that doesn't matter. This is the movie, not the comics, so no, BvS is not around the time of The Dark Knight Returns. Just like how it didn't matter that Tony Stark created Ultron in the movies, when Pym created him in the comics.",4w86a7
d67kiof,"Batman knocking Deadshot to the floor in two seconds isn't a ""fight"" by any definition of the word.",4w86a7

d66farg,"A lot of people thought the previews made it look good. And it ended up being bad. It's not rocket science, pal. ",4w86a7
d66ur7n,Since when has the joker acted rationally? Or been able to show emotions in a conventional way? What bothered me was when Harley thought the Joker died. She was sad for a second then went about her maniacal way. I get she is crazy but he dude she in madly in love with just died.... I was hoping that was going to send her off the rails a bit harder. ,4w86a7
d66v6r1,I guess it was there to establish how 'crazy' and unpredictable he could be. That or they wanted to let the audience know this is not normal she had to be shocked to be crazy as she is. ,4w86a7
d67mwcb,"Bank robbery and murder. They said he had robbed every bank in Australia, then decided to come to the states to rob the Diamond exchange,. They showed him robbing the place, and killing his partner, before our lourd and savior, Barry Allen, ^^^^praise ^^^^be ^^^^unto ^^^^him showed up. They said he doesn't work well with others right after they showed him killing his partner, inferring that wasn't his first go at murder during a heist.

Also, Jai Courtney is Australian, that's actually his legitimate accent.

",4w86a7
d74bhv4,Danny McBride did literally that in Vice Principles. Ridiculous. ,4w86a7

d6hqkt6,I think he started it at 20.  It was definitely at 2 when it was underwater at the end.,4w86a7
d6bh5t5,I actually liked the way he looked. And when the train came and he was splitting it while also consuming any souls who so happened to be on the train. Was cool to me. Like that one ancient warrior from the new Mortal Kombat game.,4w86a7

d6hmo8f,Perhaps because it's outside the comics? Just guessing.,4w86a7
d69gxn8,What the hell is wrong with you,4w86a7

d66kopu,"I agree. The action scenes flowed but had no big punches or interesting environment damage, they just seemed like a few slaps and kicks and swings of a sword",4w86a7
d67fn2y,"In defense (or devils advocate), they didn't have much time for action as they had to expound on a team of characters.  I think they spent too much time on Joker, and the whole helicopter scene was unecessary.  It would have been just as good if we we're introduced to joker in Harley's intro and see him again when he breaks her out.  All that extra time could have been used for additional action scenes of other characters.",4w86a7

d663emu,"He was great because he was so different - if every villain tries to tear the team apart then we'd start asking for apocalyptic fights. 

Either way, she fought them by hand because she wanted them to join her. She even addressed this when she said metahumans are the future or something like that. ",4w86a7
d66yg7k,"Thank you, my sister says he sucks but I keep telling her he's probably the best villain since Loki. Not only does he succeed he's not the cliché ""I'm going to bring about the end of the world"" type that plagues Marvel's movies. ",4w86a7
d6636ow,"Kingpin takes the #1 spot for best MCU villain, no question",4w86a7

d67795p,His characters only purpose was to add time to the movie. That whole harly Quinn rescue scene was a waste of time. ,4w86a7
d6bgurg,"But in the movie, it clearly showed that the seals were nowhere near the level that Deadshot was at. They even stopped firing and marveled at him on top of the car blowing away everyone who came near him. For christ sake, he shot perfect holes out of metal targets by continuing to fire in the exact same spot. Not continuing to fire in the same spot, but going back and forth with the targets and hitting the exact same spot he hit before.",4w86a7
d6a2h5m,"Deadshot literally never misses.  That's his entire point.  No navy seal is comparable.  

He's still is no match for a Superman level charactger but he stood up to Batman a few times.",4w86a7
d683xv9,"Actually SEALs simply take dozens and dozens of magazines to fire as much as possible during firefights. Not saying that they can't shoot, just that there MO is to fill the air with as much lead as possible.",4w86a7
d66ei37,"She is the only one who could have killed the enchantress though. They don't explain it but Harley's power is her ability to manipulate others with deliberate theatrics. 

In this movie she tricked Flagg into getting alone time with her phone, she softens up Deadshot so he doesn't ultimately kill her, sell the Joker's death so he could save her again, and all of this was a build up to her tricking the Enchantress.

",4w86a7
d660qly,"i don't think the team was meant to be all powerful, just meant to be criminals they were willing to risk",4w86a7

d6aq1qk,That one guy in the suit that traveled with Joker literally did all of the work. Joker was a bust. ,4w86a7

d6aep2f,"The scene with her and Deadshot in the staircase where she called him a sociopath was so frustrating. First, Deadshot clearly loves his daughter. Secondly, there was a brief flash of Harley being lucid, and then it cut away. I would have LOVED if they showed Harley being lucid for just a few moments before she relapses into insanity .... but no. They cut away just as it was getting interesting.",4w86a7
d68jtai,"I was thinking that the whole time! Imo it would've looked better and been more deadly than the bat.

d6935ob,"If they do, that's never established at all.",4w86a7

it was a desperate last minute hail mary in the face of total annihilation that probably at best would stun Incubus, allowing them the attack him and Enchantress with everything they had

 Joker is supposed to be bad, disloyal, doesn't give a shit about anyone. If joker is trying to save/free harley its because he wants something that she has or something she knows. Its never out of love, it shouldn't be.

d6789hy,"After reviews the previous DC movies were too dark they removed quite a bit. The original color schemes were dark, then they were bright. There was a cool thing on imgur a while ago that showed each new poster got progressively lighter. The more aggressive 'clear abuse' scenes got cut (domestic abuse in this case). 

As to 2 comments up, it's a big moment because it's the Jokers first appearance in the new DC universe of film. You can bet there will, sooner or later, be a film that heavily relies on Batman and the Joker. There always seems to be. People got to see how Leto plays the Joker and therefore see how he'll play in future DC films. 

But yeah, I'm pretty disappointed in the amount of screen time. If you look for it in the movie, you can tell by the dialogue there were meant to be a lot more Joker scenes. 

ALSO, did anyone else feel the Joker 'death scene' (helicopter crash) was complete BS? It's obvious they aren't going to kill the Joker that quickly or in that manner. Yes I know we aren't sure if he died or not, (no huge explosion, dead body seen), but the way she reacts it leads us to assume he's dead, but did anyone actually think that....",4w86a7

That he is always cruel to her and while she is in love with him, he just keeps around around sorta? I know Harley breaks up with Joker and at one point puts a serious beat down on him so how could they not put this aspect in the film? Would of thought this would be a good hook. Have Joker the main bad guy wreaking all sorts of chaos in an attempt to get Harley back. Over the course of the movie their relationship is revealed with all the fucked up things he has done to her, and she helps put him in Arkham where said beatdown occurs. Would of been a dark tone to the movie yeah but would think that would be a good story, that even after years of Jokers horrific abuse she got stood up to him, got away, beat the shit out of him and proved she was stronger than him.

I could have sworn he never slapped ""The body gibbiati"" and said he wanted to show him his toys.

The grenade scene seems like it would have been interesting.

I just read an article on IGN yesterday where Leto was talking about how they cut a large amount of his scenes.
Maybe to save time or for pacing, but a lot of joker material so gone.

Personally, I would have preferred if they removed shit scenes like ""y'all just tourists here"" followed by the most painfully funny waddling into water, I've ever seen.

Also feel like the ""but you tried to hurt my friends"" line from Harly was hollow and poorly delivered. 
And the line from Diablo ""I already lost one family, I won't lose another"" was shit.
They've known each other twelve hours, they're not family.

Anyway; remove those scenes and give joker more time to establish who he is and give us a better glimpse of what angle joker was going at. 
I didn't like what I saw, he may have done much more that we will never see though.

If not, he can trace where the footage came from and go that route. I mean, when you take a picture on a fucking iPhone now it'll tell you where it was taken when you load it up to Instagram. There is no reason in the fucking world that Bruce had to go to that lady for information on Barry and Arthur except for the sake of a midcredits scene. And what was up with her knowing his identity? That was so goddamn dumb, I was fuming when I left the theater.

Worst case scenario, he can break into her office as the goddamn Batman and steal that file from her. He can interrogate Lex as Batman. Literally anything else. And he can do it all as Batman. Bruce Wayne shouldn't be forming the Justice League in the first place, and if he does, it should only be as Batman. Don't do what Marvel is doing an make everyone's identities public, because it just doesn't work like that. 

Honestly, that scene was a piece of shit. If Bruce can pull up Diana's email and track her down through Lex's information, he should've had no problem getting to Barry and Arthur through that footage too. It just goes to show that WB/DC really have no fucking clue what they're doing. ",4w86a7

He just looked creepy for most of his screen time, cackled a lot, looked stoned, yelled and was just... I can get behind Ledger, Nicholson (it fit the style I know it's not amazing) and especially Hamill, but this just felt too cartoonish. Too crazy for being crazy's sake. 

I'm not a huge Batman fan, but I loved The Killing Joke (and badly need to watch the animated film of it) and adored his characterization in the Batman games. 

This just seemed.... I dunno, silly. 

That said, still better than I expected and I walked out far far far less disappointed than when I left Apocalypse which after the last 2 films was a much bigger fall. I went for my kids and expected it would be mediocre and it was slightly better than that. I figured Apocalypse was going to be meh, but it went back to the corny dialogue and acting of the first Xmen film and that... that was just too far. You can't regress and just expect it to feel okay. First Class and DoFP had something going for them. 

And even with the worst possible villain and desires from the characters, I still enjoyed watching them on screen more. 

Doesn't hurt that Robbie is stunning, Diablo's costume design was breathtaking, Smith is always charming,  and by the end I felt some connection between them all, finally. 

But Jesus what was up with June/Enchantress? Her weird dancing at the end really pulled me out of the story, she seemed insanely miscast. Her whole side of it was so weirdly done. And was it just me or did her ""brother"" look like something from the 2nd Mummy film?

that and it hitting all the ""tropes"", raising the bar 0"" and just being mediocre even with all the hype, I think that got it worse scores than we expected. I think Metacritic is more fair, I certainly wouldn't rank it in BvS territory or anything, but when I'm able to shrug off oddities in a Marvel film, or whatever but when sitting in a film and I actually say ""what? Why the fuck did that just happen?"" That film didn't do a good enough job immersing me to look past them. 

And that's SS' biggest failure, it was too disjointed and unless you actively work to build that connection, you'll walk out thinking it was shit. ",4w86a7

That's still a story.  Reservoir Dogs is about the aftermath of a heist gone wrong and the destruction of a group of thieves.  It's not a big scale story, but it's a story.

>All movies don't need this huge plot device, 

That doesn't mean there shouldn't be a story.  If there's no story, there's just a bunch of random moments or images.  There's nothing to connect them to each other, and there's nothing to connect the audience to the film.  There's nothing to care about.

>maniacal characters being humanized by their different experiences of love. Harley has Joker, Deadshot has his daughter, EL Diablo and his family, Bommerang and his unicorn, Katana and her husband, Rick and June.

So now you're pointing out what the **story** is about.  Good job.

So, stories?

>if movies were always about story then they would just be books

This doesn't even make sense. 

>its a visual medium at the end of the day

A visual medium for storytelling. 
 
>and as long as the characters stick then there shouldn't be a problem.

Again, there needs to be a story for these characters to have any meaning/purpose.  Otherwise you're just watching random people do random things.

>There are too many movies where nothing happens, 12 Angry Men rings a bell.

You're confusing substance with action.  There's a lot going on in 12 Angry Men.  Just because there's no action doesnt mean nothing happens.

Show us that their mission is necessary but couldn't have been pulled off by Batman and company because they have a moral compass.

Even most of the evil acts were turned into jokes. ""HAHA that's just the rookie who was eaten alive by Killer Croc.""

I don't think everyone needs them to be Heath Ledger's Joker, but they wanted something more tangible to latch onto. If you have to TELL the audience you're a bad guy (Yes, I know it's a quip), then you're doing something wrong.

If you want to show that Flagg isn't paying attention to the Enchantress, just show him staring out the window. Keep it simple. It works. But to have him also bite into a big-ass chicken leg in the middle of the night in the dark is comical and confusing.

It causes people, if subconsciously, to ask questions. Is eating chicken an important quirk of this character? Is this guy hungry af and is his hunger going to affect something during the scene? Is this a setup for a great chicken leg gag later in the movie?

As for Wonder Woman, I think it's sort of the same reasoning. This WW can't fly or has yet to gain that ability so it would have taken time to get there.  Again, she and Batman probably assume the government has this one due to Waller downplaying the situation.

One thing I haven't liked with the DCEU is that for whatever reason they've got Bruce Wayne setting up the Justice League instead of him as Batman. Or hell, even him using Alfred or Diana to do the digging could help him keep his secret nightlife you know, secret!

I mean in the after credits scene Waller strongly implies that she knows that he's Batman! Even Lex knew who he was in BVS! 

Like in some of the comics and in the Justice League show, not even the other super heroes. apart from Superman really knew who he was.

Bruce Wayne has always been the rich playboy billionaire that doesn't do much except wear nice clothes, drive fast cars and date super models. That's his alter ego.

But now they've got Bruce going all Nick Fury on the other heroes forming the *Justice League Initiative*, even though in the comics he never really even wanted to be part of the league and was more on his own.

Despite acting somewhat randomly, every action she took was actually done so with the intention of seeing the Joker again. She is a schemer and she realizes her schemes through manipulative theatrics. Her power are her intelligence, her awareness of how her actions affect others, and her perfect control over her actions.

Her role in this movie was to show you that she could deceive Flagg and Waller (enough to organize an escape where the other characters could not), to soften up Deadshot (enough to push him to act against his own interests), and to show you she can role switch on a dime (selling the Joker's death so he can ultimately save her again) all so you can believe by the end of the story that she could kill the Enchantress.

d65zoog,"You say that, but it was a cookie-cutter plot of hero with fatal flaw finds something which gives them powers, and ultimately earns their redemption by fighting someone else either with the same powerset or historically opposed to them. That also describes pretty much every phase 1 film in Marvel, and also Ant-Man. And Man of Steel to a lesser extent. It's a nice enough formula but it's hardly inventive. 

Suicide Squad's plot is at least a bit more interesting. Most members at least show some utility that the rest of the team couldn't have done. They were the best metahumans available (since the Justice League doesn't exist yet) and they were facing a metahuman threat they were totally unprepared for. The plot is hardly original, but it was perfectly adequate and worked fairly well.

And Marvel's success elsewhere doesn't necessarily mean that a given Marvel film is particularly good, or better than a DC film. Suicide Squad is a decent, enjoyable film. Nothing new, or groundbreaking. It's not going to set any records, but I'm still going to put it on par with Ant-Man.",4w86a7

Otherwise how would she be able to hold her own against all the super powered maniacs throughout the years of her appearing in comics? Whether it's bomb collars, or some sort of hostage, or even tricking them psychologically. I always got the feeling that she was in control. But in regards to this movie the feeling was kind of so-so. I still think they should have explained exactly why Enchantress couldn't just teleport and get her heart from the box.

I'll probably get downvoted to hell. 

Ledger didn't really let up from the threatening, menacing side of the character. And Nicholson seemed to lean towards the wacky, silly side (though he did get threatening at times)

Leto plays both sides, quite well, and all within the same line of dialogue. 

My particular favourite scene was a quick one. I don't remember it exactly, I'm going to paraphrase.

Some dude is waiting on a couch surrounded by Joker goons. He's clearly terrified. Joker makes his entrance, slowly and menacingly. The guy tries to stutter out some words, but Joker doesn't respond. He silently, walks in front of the dude, and slowly raises his hand, as a princess would when expecting to have their hand kissed by a prince. The guy hesitates and very slowly and carefully kisses Joker's hand/ring. Very suddenly Joker leaps onto the guys lap like child with a big smile on his face and says ""See, I felt like you really meant that""

It was a perfect mix of the 2 sides of Joker.

That scene with the batmobile?  Real Superman grabs Bats, flys to some secluded mountain with him and forces him to sit down and talk.  He doesn't make threats, says ""your persona is dead"".  He says ""Is this really the way?  Are you making the world a safer place, or just escalating the problem?  We both want the same thing but you have to see that you're making it worse"".   

Like he's done a thousand times in the comics with both Batman AND Luthor.  

Superman sees the good in people.  He sees their good intentions.  It's why he's never just flown to the top of Lexcorp and thrown Luthor out of the 78th story window, even for all the damage Lex has done.  He always hopes that there is something to be salvaged. 

It's the beautiful irony of the character:  His superpowers enable him to refuse to use them.  He can sit there without fighting back and TALK to you while you burn your energy trying in vein to take him down.  He uses his powers only when you've backed him into a corner either with Kryptonite or other people who could get hurt.  They're the shortcut that he refuses to use unless forced.  Because he'd rather win you over to his side than put you in chains.  ",4w86a7

Contrast this with Suicide Squad, which is a plodding mess, and after BvS there were tons of reports about studio heads getting concerned for Suicide Squad as a result.

This is what happens when the guys in charge of the money try to also be the creatives on the film, having little to no trust in the people they hired to get the job done.

This ^ is the operative sentence.  No, I haven't read any Suicide Squad comics, and neither has the majority of the population, as much as you might hate to hear it.

If a film can't provide an audience, regardless of said audience's knowledge of source material, with relatable characters and an intriguing, (at least semi-believable), storyline, that film isn't going to do well.

I shouldn't have to be a long-time fan of the comic books in order to enjoy the movie.  That's the problem.  It's the reason why shitty Transformers movies keep getting made.  As James Rolfe said, Transformers movies keep getting made because people go to see them, but people go to see them because Transformers has such long and storied history, (despite the comics and various different cartoon series' being essentially extended toy commercials with storylines).  Guys in their 30's and 40's are taking their kids to see the Transformers movies not because the movies are actually good, but because it just seems like such a novelty to see the characters they've only known through poorly animated cartoons and plastic toys come to life on the big screen.

The same is true of Suicide Squad.  If you're a long-time Suicide Squad fan, I'm sure there must be a great deal of novelty to seeing your *favorite* characters come to life on the big screen, but the truth is, to the rest of us, the movie fucking sucks.

Suicide squad currently has the same rating on rotten tomatoes as [Gordy, will ferrell's land of the lost, ryan reynolds green lantern etc](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/browse/dvd-all/?maxTomato=26&services=amazon;amazon_prime;flixster;hbo_go;itunes;netflix_iw;vudu&sortBy=tomato) and is marked as worse than every movie to come out this year except [ice age and hillary's america](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/browse/in-theaters/?maxTomato=50)   it's one thing to think a movie is bad, it's another thing to look at the data without context and use that to justify an opinion that something is terrible and pretending that the 1 votes should carry the same weight as people that took their time and actually gave an honest number ",4w86a7

For me, Squad really clicked! I was shocked by how jazzed I was after exiting the theater. Just my two cents ",4w86a7
d66h768,Honestly... that is what a lot of people think of the comic book version that way as well. Seeing the movie it looked like they based it the first run of the suicide squad.. This for me was a comic book fan's comic book movie.. I think some people thought going in this was going to be the Avengers with bad guys.. Most of the squad in the comics books were not fighting super villains... they were cleaning up messes caused the American government or some one else.. It was not a shocker that some grade C villain got killed during a mission (or just plain skipped out when they had a chance). Captain Boomerang was just a useless in the comic (if not outright a comic foil for Waller to openly mock.) That is going to be the problem for DC... outside of the First Six from the Justice League cartoon.. DC little know comics can be a hard can to crack.. If anything Waller will become the more ruthless Nick Fury character of sorts..     ,4w86a7
d66ehry,"Yes, Waller was clearly showing the audience that not all ""villains"" are behind bars. But I'll give the film credit in how it treated the Squad. They're pretty villainous IMO. Croc murders quite a few marines, Harley is violent as hell and it's not really kiddied-down. Pretty sure she straight up shanks a few guards. Deadshot is easily the most morally righteous but he has to be. I mean, we as the audience need that anchor and it's Will Smith! They paid for Will Smith and they got a Will Smith performance. I can't fault them for not wanting to make him dark",4w86a7
d6817q0,"I think Marvel deserves some additional credit for paving the way, I still sometimes think about how amazing it is that Avengers got made.

I could see an argument for this not cracking Marvel's top 5, but thats about as hard as I can be on it. I'd say it beats Iron Man 2 and 3, Incredible Hulk, both Thors, and Avengers 2 without question. I think it edges out Cap 1 and 3 along with Antman.

1) I'm not looking for brownie points buddy. Parallax was a DC villian dude. And I didn't like Bane either for that matter. I thought the protagonists in SS we're just fine. In fact, I liked the chemistry between HQ and Mr J just as much as anything I've seen in Marvel. 

2) It's a movie. If you're going to stand there and over-analyze (see original comment) every bit of a comic book fight, you're missing out in my opinion.  

3) I don't understand. Are you angry people like her character?

4) I didn't think he was better than Ledger by any stretch, and it may have simply been the inclusion of HQ that made me love it so much, but I find myself wanting more. If I had to come up with a criticism, it was the lack of jokes or laughter during his interactions. My kingdom for a fake gun gag.

I have to recollect and reiterate my response to another comment in this thread in that it's the wasted potential that is the biggest disappointment for me.

Romero's the campy classic clown Joker. Charming if you're into the Adam West show.

Nicholson's Joker was more an 80's version of a 40's era mobster Joker... but really it was just Jack being Jack, which turns out makes for a great Joker.

Ledger's Joker was the gritty one that made terrorism into an art form. He played really well with the extremes being funny and terrifying and really embodied the chaotic nature of the Joker.

Leto... after just seeing this movie... is kinda like the Pimp version of the Joker. He's not some artistic terrorist, or some classy mobster, he's more like a low class gangster, and I guess my biggest problem with him was that he wasn't all that funny. Still I'll run with it.",4w86a7

I see what you mean with big punches as Croc (who looks like the teams muscle) doesn't really do anything spectacular.  In Marvel's Avengers you see Hulk and Thor tear through structures like tissue paper (or when Hulk bitch slams Loki like a ragdoll).  

Boomerang did nothing noteworthy except for using his boomerang as a drone.

He will probably be Superman for the entirety of the Justice League films and any cameos he makes in any other league member films.

They even made a huge point to show that he was ""into"" pink unicorns.  The joke was used three times.  Once on his description.  A second time when he was suiting up, and a third time when his stuffed animal falls out and he ""covertly"" puts it back in. 

There was **no** payoff for the stuffed animal.  There should have at least been another guy calling him out on it.

Hyperbole
Definition: 
A hyperbole is a literary device wherein the author uses specific words and phrases that exaggerate and overemphasize the basic crux of the statement in order to produce a grander, more noticeable effect. The purpose of hyperbole is to create a larger-than-life effect and overly stress a specific point. Such sentences usually convey an action or sentiment that is generally not practically/ realistically possible or plausible but helps emphasize an emotion.

So, you yourself said hyperbole. Is hyperbole somehow different from the rhetorical use of exaggeration to you? Ok, let's go with the textbook definition:

noun, Rhetoric.
1.
obvious and intentional exaggeration.

Worst movie ever? Yup, that's a clear exaggeration. It couldn't be the actual worst movie of all time, well it could, but it's too early to tell. Plus there's so many great contenders for that spot that it must be an exaggeration.

'One of the worst movies ever', that's not really an obvious exaggeration, so I'll concede that point despite the fact that you called it hyperbole in the first place. Some movies suck, even if you like them. 

It's better to not get so wound up on what people think of something you like.",4w86a7

I wish they had brought more of Lexs confidence out rather then that twitchy awkwardness that was done. Lex thinks that humans can achieve just as much as  Superman can, thats what he hates. That humans are seen as less before this Superman. It touches on the responsibility of super heroes that both Civil War and BvS use for their conflict. Its pretty common in comics to have that public opinion outrage instead of a do-no-wrong public that loves Superman/Captain America.

My problem is they didn't have to show that to us. We already know Amanda is manipulative and all-powerful. I'm okay with Rick being in love with Dr. June, but the prospect of Amanda needing any more exposition is seriously uncalled for. Give us one good scene where he isn't lashing out or Walking with a stick up his butt. Yeah, the closing scene where he's overlooking Deadshot is touching, but cmon, Rick Flag is wholly unlikable, and that's not right. 

>[Diablo] was the most powerful meta-human actually going through remorse. He was the only one able to see through the hypnotic vision and probably saved their asses in the end.

In a span of 12-14 hours, Diablo went from being really broken and beaten, to proclaiming that the suicide squad are his family. Then, once he did sacrifice himself against Incubus, nobody mentioned him again. Yeah, that was the point of the suicide squad itself, but its still worth mentioning that nobody seemed to care. 

>I think this movie is being judged way too hard. It was never going to be Oscar worthy. I went in with super low expectations and had a good 90 minutes.

It says a lot about the DCEU when every review is prefaced with ""I went in with super low expectations."" I went into Antman and Guardians of the Galaxy not knowing what to expect, and they're two of my favorite movies now. The first Captain America, in my opinion, is probably the most rewatchable film of all time. If Suicide Squad isn't striving for any of them, then I don't get what the point of it was. It was supposed to be funny, and it was, but that's not a solid outline for a summer blockbuster. The last Ninja Turtles Movie also set out to be funny and laid-back, doesn't mean it was a particularly great movie.

Go watch Jeremy jahns I think he says it better than me, and I didn't see his review to after I saw SS, so it didnt prejudice my own views, just I feel he says a lot of what i felt going in thinking it will suck. 

As for mediocre, I think that's a touch unfair. Clash of the Titans, first Harry Potter film, ironman 2, daredevil, green lantern, any of the wolverine films, xmen 3, last few Spider-Man, all were far far worse than suicide squad. Or dont you agree? All of these I would put as ""mediocre"" as you can't say they didn't have some talent involved.

Would you place xmen 3, higher than suicide squad? The last Spider-Man? Green lantern or daredevil? Pixels? Ghostbusters 2016? As I felt all of those were inferior to suicide squad in both production, plot and overall fun. Yet all are considered better or on par.

Portraying Harley and the Joker outside of their abusive relationship is destroying the dynamic of the two. Harley, in terms of the Joker, is a sidekick.

edit: I'll also add that, yes, people are allowed to do mundane tasks in a movie. They are people and movies can be used to emulate life. But mundane tasks should be kept mundane. They only work when they don't distract from the scene. When they shot Flagg eating the chicken leg, it was the *only thing* happening on screen. It implied some prominence.

But you can't go around and hate a fairly unoriginal but mostly functional plot in DC if half of Marvel pulls the same thing. Previously we'd likely never have seen most of the squad on the big screen, and yet here we are.

>True, but the track record of success means that they're more likely to get a pass for things that more largely affect DC films.

That's not the way to analyse films. Iron Man being good doesn't automatically make Iron Man 2 and 3 good. Just as the Incredible Hulk being bad doesn't make the Avengers films bad by association.

d65jgp4,"The character in BvS behaves realistically as far as the character has been constructed.  He was never shown to be that ""goodie two shoes"" so why would he be now.  

However, I suggest that this is the problem at its heart:  That is exactly why the character isn't Superman.  

It's not just the 50s.  I believe that the character's steadfast ""Truth, Justice, and the American Way"" attitude becomes even *more* interesting in a modern era (as shown to a degree by Captain America in Marvel's movies).  It almost becomes a fish out of water bit that Superman gets away with because of his power.  He can afford to give us the benefit of the doubt because when he's wrong it doesn't hurt him.  

In the original Batman Returns comic (80s isn't exactly modern but hang with me) they turn it on its ear by using Supe's boyscout mentality against him.  He fights Batman because the President of the US asks him to.  Supes thinks it's wrong... but questions his own judgement because well...  *how could the president be wrong?*  

Batman has a great conversation where someone asks him ""Why do you think you'll win?""  to which he replies ""Because deep down Clark is a good person.  And deep down I am not"".  

I find him a much more interesting character as a ""shining light in the darkness"" figure.  A ""I refuse to see the world this way.  Even if that's how it actually is.  I just won't.  It's not how I was brought up.  If enough people refused to see it that way alongside me... maybe it wouldn't have to be that way after all"".

But you haven't provided any sort of justification as for why he is. Kanye's music is the exact opposite of pandering; he experiments with many different sounds and types of music.

Cole - both of whom *could* be labelled as 'sell-out' given they stick to one particular formula and brand of familiar production/instrumentation/lyricism - Kanye is way more daring and innovative with his music.

You're free to argue otherwise, but I don't think you'll get very far.

Flagg was the typical stereotype marine/leader and Deadshot toed the line a lot with just being the gangster black guy who is leaving a kid behind.  

Waller also could pretty easily be the typical ""I don't give a shit about you, get the job done"" honcho.  Changing her from a white dude to a black female doesn't change the character type(to me at least). 

Harley honestly is probably the most unique character in the entire lineup.  I probably enjoyed her the most but maybe Deadshot as well even with the strange ""I'm a black guy"" reminders.

The result living in these places and learning most of my Spanish there is apparently pretty amusing to Native Spanish speakers I talk. When in Tarragona I accidentally learned Catalan, because the family I was staying with didn't speak entirely fluent Spanish. So when I went to Mexico to learn more, feeling like hot shit and thinking I was 4/10 fluent, I started saying shit in this weird accent with fuckin ""th's"" all over the goddamn place, and certain words that are SO not spanish. So then I had to kinda cleanse my Spanish there a learned a bunch more before I moved to Miami where I speak Spanish every day at work.

And when my Peruvian friend hears it he starts laughing literally *every time* cause in his words ""Dude imagine like a Mexican, who had a bad Mexican accent, but *tried* to sound like a black guy, but on certain words and out of fucking nowhere sounded British. That's you, but in Spanish""

I think the compelling thing about Ike's character was that he was funny and charming despite being a total dick.

I agree with him on these three except to me it was just Will Smith playing a slightly darker Will Smith than usual. I enjoyed it, but I didn't really think it was Deadshot. Other than that he kind of just says the movie was exactly what the DC universe needed without going into specifics. 

As far as those other movies, I definitely agree that GL and the Andrew Garfield Spiderman movies were worse than SS. I never saw Clash of the Titans but it looked like it was pretty terrible. The wolverine movies I'd put about on par with SS. I haven't seen X3, Daredevil movie, or the first HP in a long time so I can't really say but I don't think I would place them higher than SS if I watched them again.

Harly and ivy were evading police and doing well. Until harly calls joker to see how he is doing and joker plays it cool but is furious. He goes to find and kill ivy because he wants harly.

And then all of a sudden, the awesome guy, great father, and all around hero just wants to murder the Bat in cold blood? Bullshit.

Reddit loves to use the saying ""show, don't tell"" when it comes to movies. When a character is beating up bullet resistant enemies with a baseball bat, that's you being shown that she is pretty strong. 

Also, that scene with the Joker when she fell into the vat of acid? It said ""ACE Chemical"" on the side. Might be what caused it (or might not be).

And remember how she shouted that she couldn't swim, but survived going through the car windshield with barely a scratch? That's not normal.

dbmzmmn,"When did I say that Kanye is 100%, unflinchingly dedicated for the preservation of creative artistry whenever he produces an album? **Every artist** does what they do, in some part, for the money they get as a return. There's a reason they charge prices for their albums and go on tours.

That doesn't make Kanye a 'cash-grab artist'. This is a point you weirdly can't grasp. A cash-grab artist is someone who aims for mass appeal to maximize their outreach with as many listeners as possible. The examples I gave you above fit that description perfectly. They don't expand outside their comfort zone because they're afraid of taking risks, because that might reduce their appeal. They are truly 'cash-grab artists', because their art is influenced solely by the motivation of catering to as broad an audience as possible. 

Kanye, conversely, is almost the antithesis of this. By reshaping album structure, themes, and instrumentation for each album, you can see he's not producing his work for maximized appeal. He's attempting to diversify his craft as much as possible. This attitude with regards to his work should be **championed**. Listen to The College Dropout, then to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, then to Yeezus, and tell me they sound the same. At all. Hint: once you get around to actually listening to his music, you'll agree with me that they don't.

In fact, MBDTF was one of his most critically acclaimed and successful albums, well regarded as his magnum opus even today. Kanye deliberately *shifted* from that maximalist, production-on-steroids feel of the album and went for a more minimalist approach with Yeezus. This drew up a *ton* of controversy. Are you going to tell me that this deviation was motivated by sales? By broad appeal?

No. It was motivated by his desire to create art and to expand his range. Creating high-end fashion lines have nothing to do with his abilities and/or aspirations as a musical artist.

Calling Kanye what you did would be like applying the same label to Christopher Nolan, just because both their works are highly popular and gross truckloads of revenue. You're ignoring the merit of their craft itself.
