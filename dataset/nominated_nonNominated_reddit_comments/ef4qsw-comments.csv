They can't get out of the jewelry shop without the door being fixed and they just shot the guy that fixed it before (where two others failed). Also, his wife was freaking out (about the trunk thing and weird phone call from earlier) and was about to call the cops.

fbz9xgl,"This movie is a perfect example of how to build tension throughout a movie. 

From the moment Howard is introduced, we see how tight of a rope he is walking. I don’t know how Sandler did it, but he elevated and already amazing story. The pace is so tight and the camera is right up in the actors face that you get everything. I want to know how the duck they filmed the kidnapping in the car. 

Kevin Garnett was surprisingly really good. I mean, it’s not like an amazing performance, and I don’t know basketball or Garnett personally, but he really pulled it off, along with all the other actors. 

This movie ties with the Lighthouse and Knives Out as my movie of the year.",ef4qsw
fbzg3ch,"The whole movie definitely had this steady, building tension, but the scene where KG comes back with the Opal and they can’t get the door open while the phones are ringing and the camera is just panning around the jewelry shop really stepped on the gas. It felt like the movie didn’t let up from there, and when it finally was over I felt like I could finally breathe again.

*edit* the fact that Howard’s tag was sticking out of his sweater the whole time was driving me CRAZY",ef4qsw

I was blown away when it's revealed he's Howard's Brother-In-Law and you can tell throughout the whole movie he kinda cares about him and took Howard's negligence to heart.

fc0py3h,"It seemed as Howard lived a pretty luxurious lifestyle between the big house in the suburbs, the apartment in the city, the Mercedes Benz and all the fancy jewelry he had.

fc1psf5,"This whole movie really impressed me, but the scene that I fell head over heels in love with was the ending when Sandler has the goons trapped in the glass box. That’s really clever writing. The fact that he’s got these people imprisoned but the threat is still squarely on him is a remarkable twist of tension and subversion of the typical rules of conflict. I had a smile on my face the whole time and really felt like I was witnessing some brilliant cinematic storytelling.",ef4qsw

fc220su,"I think one of my favorite scenes in this movie that helps really convey just how fucked Howard’s life is was when the doctor calls in to tell him about the colonoscopy and if he had colon cancer. You have everyone literally yelling and freaking out at him, and when the doctor finally drops the big news that he’s gonna be ok, it doesn’t even matter because Howard has so much other shit he has to worry about first. Just a brilliant portrayal of a guy who is in way over his head on everything",ef4qsw

Her husband was like “wait, really?” But just had to follow her out as well. It’s kind of funny cuz the character stopped masturbating almost immediately, but this old couple committed to it and walked out and never came back after that.",ef4qsw

Was he fucking with Howard the whole time? As an audience member at first we think he's scamming Howard, but we don't see the years of them working together prior to when the film starts.

fc76sf7,"I loved the post game interview with KG - when he said that it was just ""me and the rock"" - 'rock' is used as a slang for the basketball itself, and if you heard that in an interview you'd think it was just that he was connected to the basketball and making it do what he wanted. But it was more of a connection to the gemstone and how he got lost in it.

Howard majorly fucked over his family member who paid $190k for the stone at the auction.

No way that dude is getting his money back lmao",ef4qsw
fc3jm2c,"Eric Bogosian as Arno was a really interesting character to me: when he's introduced, and throughout most of the film up until the final moments, his unrelenting stare at Howard whenever they were near each other was brutal, but hard to read. For a long time I interpreted it as a dude who would have ripped Howard to pieces if not for their familial bond. By the end though, as the Celtics win and thereby Howard, he seemed to soften a moment, as if in relief, and not two minutes later, you see that he doesn't command overwhelming authority over his mad-dog enforcer. Not sure if anyone else was impressed upon by his character/acting, but those stares man. Like gleaming daggers.",ef4qsw
fbzzt93,This movie did a great job portraying the hilarity and lunacy of sports betting. Howie laying on the floor in his son’s room watching the game on his phone with headphones in was hilarious and sad at the same time.,ef4qsw
fbzc40j,"Was anyone else blown away when we find out Arno is Howies brother in law? So Howie owes him $100k for what we assume are gambling debts. Arno is family with Howard, but still hires these goons to come and shake him down. And who are these goons that he hired? Why are they so invested in this money Arno lent out that they go ahead and actually kill Howard on their own? Then Arno takes one in the head from his own muscle. That’s the only thing that bothered me in the storyline so far is that I didn’t understand the motivation from the goons to go rogue like that. I guess they were just complete psychopaths",ef4qsw

fc2vcsw,"I really stopped seeing Sandler about 30 minutes into this. He really disappeared into that role. I can't believe I could hate a guy so much and still really root for him. SPOILERS: After that ending, I felt myself doing that ""how do we undo this"" thing where I just didn't want it to end like that, even though he was so addicted to betting that I couldn't see it not coming to that eventually anyway. It's got to be a devastating mix of emotions for all of the other characters after this. I don't think there was a single character in this that I'd want to know in real life. Damn this was a great movie.",ef4qsw
fc7heij,"This was one of the most unique movies I’ve ever seen. It felt like a documentary that I just caught in the middle—there was no scene setting, no real introduction of characters, just BAM we’re all here in the middle of this story, try like hell to keep up. The whole theater did a collective gasp to the last scene. 

The whole thing was tense, chaotic, and so so real. My favorite throwaway part was Howard weighing himself during the argument in the bathroom during Passover dinner—just a very real thing we’ve all done in someone else’s bathroom. 

Overall, great movie. One of my favorites this year. I hope Sandler gets some awards.",ef4qsw
fbz5gb0,"The ""this is how I win"" speech was one of the best scenes of the year. Not only is KG surprisingly good but Sandler just channels this absolutely perfectly realized scam artist who will do anything to feel the same power and control as the rich famous clients who come into his store. What a magnificent performance.",ef4qsw
fc73e4r,"I’m not sure why, but I feel more impacted by the Arno murder more than the Howard shooting. 

Howard’s death didn’t come as much of a surprise (I really didn’t think his story would have a happy ending) but something about the image of Arno’s sheer panic trying to get out of the store (“LET ME OUT OF HERE!”) keeps popping back into my mind.",ef4qsw
fcjiajx,"This is gonna sound weird as fuck, but about 4 years ago, I gave the 2 guys with gray hair who are complaining about the fake watch a ride home. It was raining and they asked me and my friend for a quick ride. When they came on the screen I turned to one of my friends and go “those look like the guys we gave a ride home from bank of america” I definitely wasnt fully convinced it was them, but it looked so much like them that I was like this might actually be them.

When we get out of the movie I bring up how it looked like these guys to the rest of my friends we were with. One of my friends mom works at the library in our town, she told him this guy comes in all the time and tells her hes in the new movie Uncut Gems. He showed me a picture in a text with his Mom and it was one of the guys! That had to be one of the craziest things thats happened to me while watching a movie haha!",ef4qsw

I thought she was gonna be up to something when she sounded so short on the phone while he was getting ready to surprise her, but no, it's only because she went out and got something sexy and wanted to surprise him as well. 

I also like how she was actually in love with him. I feel like usually in these types of movies her character is a scheming two face. But she actually did love him and it never even crossed my mind that she could take the money and run at the end until after the film because it's something that she would just never do.",ef4qsw

fc32kve,"The scene when Howard is trying to convince Dinah to reconsider the divorce as she's wearing her old dress is a standout in a film full of standout scenes. She's so composed as she's telling him that he's delusional and she'd rather never see him again, and then the women rush in and she pretends like that's not what was happening a second ago. Most every adult in this movie is living some kind of double life and financing it in one way or another by extracting too much worth from what's meaningful to them. Also, Howard taunting the guys he had trapped in the door during the big game was the stupidest thing to do, but also entirely believable that he would. Even if he knew that it could get him killed, how could he resist the urge to gloat?",ef4qsw

Arno seems somewhat relieved and proud at Howard winning but by lending Howard money, he was aiding the addiction.

His girlfriend was aiding his addiction and fully supportive of his lifestyle. 

His wife, sees him in a trunk naked, is at the end of her rope and doesn’t care. 

His daughter calls seeing him run behind stage “awkward” which should have triggered some alarm in her. 

His teenage son, thinks him winning big is cool.

His doctor called him, and I thought ok, the doctor's gonna give the bad news now but no, he just said that Howard was perfectly healthy and hung up the phone. These events without predictible outcomes made the movie way better for me, knowing that the writers's ideas for the scenario wasn't predictible for me, so I just watched to see what was going to happen without being able to guess what was gonna happen next even within the next 30 seconds.",ef4qsw

fbz7rof,"I just got out of the theater watching it. I've been hearing insane hype over this movie not only on reddit and online outlets but through the media as Sandler and KG did the press tours and word of mouth. Plotwise I went into it pretty blind as I wanted to save the viewing experience for the film. And boy am I glad I did because I absolutely loved this movie.

First off, the acting. From the first few minutes when Sandler appears on screen, I'm absorbed into Howard Ratner. I've historically thought of Sandler as an actor who plays himself in all his roles, comedy + punch drunk love otherwise, but when he steps into the jewelry store I only see a NY Jewish Jeweler obsessed with gambling. Everything from his glasses to the way he texts to how easily angered he gets to the look on his face when he's placing a bet, it all adds to the character and depth of who Howard is intrinsically as a person. Of course everyone else gives great performances, especially the unexpected KG and Julia Fox, but imo Sandler commands the movie with how deep into his character he gets.

It's also very busy, half of the movie is Sandler getting visited by his various debt collectors while trying to make deals or talking on the phone while trying to make a bet. All of this is supposed to add to the growing tension of how overwhelmed Howard feels but also keeps you on your toes and feeling nervous for what's going to happen next, which in my opinion is the mark of a great thriller.

The entire movie I kept thinking ""Is he going to get out of this? Or are we going to get a happy ending?"" I didn't know whether I wanted Howard to succeed or not. On one hand, nothing is going his way, he has so many opportunities to make things happen but all of them keep falling through or things keep happening. On the other hand, every time he gets an escape, every time he gets a bailout or a stroke of good luck, he flips it into another bet. All his watches he had loaned from KG's friend, all the pieces friends had let him borrow he keeps pawning into more bets. All of his unhappiness is brought upon himself, so I didn't really know what to expect. The big ending shot floored me though, just by the quickness and rawness of everything happening at once. I'm saddened by the end result, especially after knowing how much he found his purpose in betting and money (as seen in that last conversation with KG), but he did everything to deserve it. 

These are just my initial thoughts right after seeing the movie, I'm curious as to the deeper meanings of the movies that others will project, but ultimately it was very well done, an incredible, riveting story that keeps you on your toes and a performance from Sandler that will almost certainly get him an Oscar nom",ef4qsw

foi6mkv,"He is not a winner because he wins, I think he is a loser/degenerate because of what he does to get to the alledged ""win"".

There are a lot of ways to make money, there are a lot of disgusting people who have earned or stolen a lot of money, I wouldn't call them ""winners"".

Is there anything in the film that ""actually"" went well for him?

He constantly gets beaten up, he keeps swindling the people he knows, his GF cheats on him (""you know what I was before...""). His wife doesn't want ANYTHING to do with him. Instead of tucking his kid in, he is immersed in his basketball game because he has money on it, not because he enjoys it. His older kid is telling him that he has a bet on the game with some other kid (is this ok? Is he a good role model?) He tried to give a Rolex to his bookie and they have so little respect for him that he denied a gift or a Rolex (not because it was fake). He completely screws up the Opal auction because he didn't get his own appraisal; it was 100% his fault. His attempt to fix the ""him not getting an appraisal"" turned into yet another cluster fuck by him having his dad/in-law bid and win the auction, so he screwed him too. Then he calls the athlete to sell the Opal to him again and looked like a fool; and he says the dumbest thing possible, ""this is how I win...""

Think about that quote, ""this is how I win"" and who he says it to. He says this to an athlete, that practices his craft, this man is painted as an honest person, hardworking, he is a leader of his team, he goes out there, he wins the game every time and the person that is telling him, ""this is how I win..."" is a cheater, does everything wrong, is not part of ""any' team, never wins, and always looses.

All the big things in his life are fuckups. His marriage, his Opal auction, his last big bet.

His approach/lifestyle is literally robbing Peter to pay Paul, in no way is someone like that a winner; even if you think it works.

And if at the end of it he gets shot in the face then I don't think the approach/lifestyle actually works.  


And if the music made you feel disgusting that is because the music was there to make you feel what it was like to be ""him.""",ef4qsw

In particular, my expectations for the soundtrack were already skyhigh and I didn't think that Lopatin could improve on *Good Time* but all were exceeded.

One of Sandler's top 3 performamce for me (other in *Punch Drunk Love* and *Meyerowitz Stories*), and I hope he gets the awards recognition, and also that he picks up more and more serious roles. 

KG deserves praise for keeping up with the rest of the crew, and a really solid performance too. Almost everything Lakeith Stanfield touches is gold, and the diamond furby shot will become iconic.

The ending left (me atleast) the viewer with a sort of unfulfilled feeling. I believe that was entirety intentional and was a representation of Howard's life and Howard as a person. We go on this wild ride with him, at what feels like breakneck speed with people chasing him, yelling, phones ringing, relationships being destroyed, and in the end Howard takes an unceremonious bullet and it's all over.

My takeaway is that even with his winnings, his life was so unfulfilling that he was only going to continue his ways and get himself further and further into his insane lifestyle. I really feel like I lived the life of Howard and feel tired just from watching. What a great movie.",ef4qsw

fuoici2,"I don't watch many films, so please don't make fun of me:

This movie was the most anxiety-inducing film I have ever seen. The only time I could breathe was after he took his son to the apartment. That was a nice 10 seconds of no action.",ef4qsw
fbz6rqs,"What a wild ride. It's got that kind of energy that keeps you glued to it for the entire runtime. This and Good Time are very similar in that manner. Like seedy underworld Odysseys that are always on the run. From the second it starts the background noise is chaotic, the score is driving, and the performances are all happening on top of each other. You can really feel the life he's living teetering on the edge of destruction. 

Sandler is firing on all cylinders. I can't imagine anyone else keeping up with the chaos of this story. Howard is so delusional in the way that he keeps lying to himself and everyone around him while being totally intolerant of being lied to. He's a real piece of work and Sandler just kills it. One of my favorite little moments is when the collectors show up to his daughter's play and he's running through the school and he ends up backstage and almost impulsively says to everyone back there, ""Are you fuckin' kiddin' me how good you look!?"" It was those small touches that made me buy this character and showed that he was always walking that tightrope. Keeping up appearances to his family while constantly on the edge of getting fucked up because he's too cavalier with money that isn't his.

I loved how the guy he's in debt to is his brother-in-law. What a great twist on the loan shark. The Passover scene was great, and Idina Menzel is really good in this too. Crazy to imagine someone who has a top tier Broadway voice being cast in a role that didn't have any singing at all. While we're on the subject, everyone was amazing in this movie. KG got a big enough role that it could have gone to any professional actor and he was totally believable, Julia Fox was really good and had a surprisingly beautiful love for Howard, the collector thug was scary as shit, Arno was great, Judd fucking Hirsch. A great ensemble.

I liked how even though the movie took place in the very real world of loan sharks and high stakes gambling it didn't marginalize the mythical aspect of this movie. Starting it in Ethiopia feels like something from a Mummy movie, and even though we are all waiting for Howard to lose his gambles and watch it all shatter, the fantastical elements of the opal are in full play and actually affect the story in ways that surprise us. It brings him the win he knew it would but in the end he took too many liberties with those around him. There was no way he was going to pay everyone back, Howard let's it ride. It had to end somehow. 

This is a solid 9/10, one of the best movies this year. I'm unsure if Sandler will get an Oscar nom for this role, doesn't really seem like the kind of movie the Academy goes batty over, but his talent can never be in doubt again and I think the Safdies have shown they're here to fuck shit up.

I don't like Sandler's comedies (I mean, not the recent ones) but I like him in dramas. I hated the character (but in a good way) and just wanted him to face some consequences for once. I feel so bad for the kids, and they made a smart decision by reminding the audience about them at the end of the movie. Kevin Garnett was amazing. I felt so bad for Arno at the end.

fdj8xzr,"At the end, I was almost happy the Howard was killed. You see him jumping from scene to scene just absolutely fucking everything up. Seriously, what situation in this film was made better by his presence? Yet, I couldn't help but hope it got better. He very clearly has a gambling problem and is a very angry person, but the film made you feel his anxiety with him via the score and the cinematography. It does a great job of putting you in his shoes (notice how he's in literally every scene?) and it made the viewer - or at least this viewer - empathize with him. 


When he dies at the end, it's after what will probably be the highlight of his life. He's an addict, and that win is maybe the biggest high you can get as a gambling addict. Of course, he probably wouldn't have paid his brother-in-law off. Or he would have borrowed money to gamble some more. Or he would have alienated Julia. Or he would have caused more problems in his life, just as he'd caused most of the problems in the film up to that point. But he's shot in his moment of glory. His last thought was probably something like ""everything is going to be *okay* now""

fi6q4mh,"This movie literally left me saying, ""wow"".   

I just want to say it from the get-go, I did and did not expect that ending. Throughout the movie, >!you know the men going after Howard are trying to kill him!<, but when it finally happens, you're still shocked. Actually, for a moment I thought it was a dream or it didn't happen, as the camera panned up towards the mirrors.  

Anyway, did anyone else feel anxious and nervous and jittery throughout? You're going through this ride with Howard, and it's almost as if the audience has to carry the burden of Howard's anxiousness and worries. Pretty neat aspect of the movie. Howard is so consumed with his betting life that he forgets to worry about what will happen to him. >!Remember when those gangsters wanted to leave his store, but he wouldn't buzz (until after a few shouts, lol)?!< He's just so unaware and doesn't have time to collect his thoughts of what type of situation he is in.  

The camera-work / directing was also interesting. The camera would focus on certain characters actions for quite a bit, that didn't really lead up to anything big. But it's like that feeling where you wonder in other movies, once that character's scene is up, what are they doing? This movie somewhat shows that. >!Like when Howard left Julia at the club, the camera continues to follow her. I was left wondering if something bad was going to happen to her.!< And there were so many moments in the movie that I felt like that, not just for her, but for other characters.  

One scene that messed with me is when >!Howard kicks out Julia from his apartment, and when he goes there to see if she's gone, there's actually light still on in the bathroom!<. I thought, >!did she kill herself?!< Thank goodness that wasn't the case.  

>!Then the tension between his wife and him!<; Idina really made me feel uncomfortable in her scenes. She wants to make the viewers feel her pain.

So instead of extorting the guy for the million he just won (which he probably would've given to them if his life was on the line), they risk going to jail for murder....for a couple grand in jewelry?

fhuy6c5,"This movie is unlike anything I have ever seen. It feels like one constant rising action, with the entire climax, falling action and resolution jam-packed into the last 15 minutes.

In those short 15 minutes, I got it. I understood the sweaty underworld of high stakes sports bets. The entire film you're asking yourself, ""why!? WHY would someone do this to themselves!"" to ultimately feel how sugary the highs of cashing in on ridiculous bets feels for yourself.Its easy to get lost in how exciting the final game is, knowing how much money is being made with each passing minute while forgetting how much was being sacrificed for the short but intense super high. You believe, as Howard believes, that everything will be alright, because that's what the high is supposed to make you feel.

That ending was the only logical conclusion but still viscerally captivating, and leaves you with a definite impression. To see the camera pan over Howard's corpse to only reveal a shit-eating grin is a perverted ass pay off. Tbh, even in knowing how much was lost in Howard's pursuit for his big ""score"", I still really enjoyed that ending. I think it perfectly captured why gambling addictions are even real.

fd5jglq,"Fuck this movie. 70% of it is people talking over each other and yelling at each other. Nothing ever seems to go right. Howard is an extremely unlikeable character. Every time he happens to have some good luck he seems to always piss it away. The fact that he even got KG to buy the opal after trying to jack up the price at the auction was a miracle and then he goes and gambles it. Every time you’re rooting for him to fix his problems it’s like Adam Sandler just gives you the middle finger. This movie has fucked me up for the day. I’ve been an anxious mess since watching it. I feel like I owe people money. There is no way I could ever rewatch this movie.

Basically I don't understand why Howard doesn't pay back Arno with the money from the bet that he has won, or at least try to, before he knew that Arno had stopped the bet. He also has a lot of assets, which makes me wonder why he doesn't just liquidate what he has so that he can pay back his debts. I just don't understand it lol.

fc4xw5q,"I thought it was interesting how Howard mentions, “you can see the whole world through the opal” in reference to the miners in Ethiopia, the history  and specific qualities of the gem etc. We see that trance sequence in the opening, when he first gets the gem and when he is killed with that smile on his face,

Upon his death, the trance sequence happens and I couldn’t help but think about seeing the world through this bullet wound. The betrayal of his children and his wife, the fragmentation of his family with Arno, burning all his business bridges, the wins and the losses throughout the film and those long before we meet Howard. That was really striking to me and it left me leaving the theatre with more than anxiety and thinking about Julia Fox.",ef4qsw
fc5q8uq,"One of the best movies I've seen in years.

Normally I prefer the ""slow burn"" crime / ""sketchy"" dramas like No Country for Old Men, Nightcrawler, Hell or High Water, Blue Ruin etc. but the fast pace of this did not spiral out of control into sheer distraction. Was emotionally invested and the movie held my attention scene after scene after scene.

Bravo Adam Sandler for finally accomplishing some real acting again, since Y2K Uncut Gems and Funny People will be viewed as his redeeming performances.",ef4qsw
fc9bhos,"Does anyone else think Keith Williams Richards, the actor who plays ""Phil"" (thug who shot Howard) looks extremely familiar? 

I figured he was an established character actor who had been in a lot of stuff. But it's his first role. Maybe I'm thinking of someone else or maybe I've see  him elsewhere. It's bugging me.",ef4qsw
fcdnbwi,"There was a lot of things to feel about this film. It’s frenetic, fickle, and absolutely chaotic. Onset my anxiety. After watching it, I now understand why it’s also polarizing. I can say personally that I loved it but what’s interesting about it is that in major cities like NYC, you meet a lot of people like Howard. This feels very authentic and I’m baffled that this flawlessly encapsulate a specific time in the NYC culture that felt like a rush of blood to the head... and it’s a ringer of  NYC in 2012 tbh.

I get why people hated it. There’s nothing to root for with the protagonist. He’s an addict and obsessed with striking big, but I see these qualities of the big gamble and making it so reminiscent with us. It’s New York as hell and people are inclined to hate this hedonistic goose chase of wealth because it’s a jading callback. Capitalism is risking a big gamble for the sake of success and this is such a capitalist movie and I guess there’s an appeal in watching him die at probably the most absolute bliss he could ever experience.

But, in any case I loved how convicting the acting proves especially with Sandler as Howard. Loved the ensemble cast too especially Kevin Garnett, Julia Fox, and Lakeith Stanfield; they all blew me away. You can’t forget the cosmic soundtrack and the cinematography; I’ve never seen a hustler movie depicted so abstract but it somehow worked.

And I’m gonna mention that the message I drew from this film is that there is collateral damage and suffering made with chasing possessions. Feels like a blood diamond. Everybody suffers and is given grief because of the pursuit of vanity and the consequences that the protagonist does not give a fuck about.",ef4qsw
fcli6c6,"For a movie who's ending bummed me out, I can't stop thinking about it.

Like with the Mercedes trunk, don't all cars come with a safety release in the trunk now?  

How did his phone survive the fountain?

Anyone else fooled into thinking creepy helicopter pilot killed Julia and took the money?

The sexting from inside was sexy and creepy at the same time.

The scenes with his kids and trying to connect with his daughter showed that he did care and wasn't a total scumbug.

Though his death was inevitable, as a dad I kept thinking about how his kids' lives would never be the same.",ef4qsw
fctt6fv,This movie is incredible. But I can’t get over how good Julia Fox is. I was curious to know more about her after watching it as I didn’t recognize her in anything I’d seen recently. This is her first time acting in anything ever. That’s just ridiculous. She goes toe to toe with the best actor in the movie and at the very least holds her own. She’s so damn compelling in this movie. I don’t know what’s next for her but I think uncut gems will be remembered at least partly for revealing such a great talent.,ef4qsw

fdapyp9,"I think by the final act I was more invested in the outcome than I ever have been with a movie.  So unbelievably stressful.  Absolutely masterful the way the suspense builds, it didn’t feel artificial or forced at all.

The more time that passes since I’ve seen this movie, the more I keep thinking about it.  Unbelievably well done.

The way Howard is portrayed as someone who has such a degenerate fixation on gambling and who really believes his own bullshit and uses his charisma to get others on board with him was such a job well done by Sandler. I had no idea he had it in him.",ef4qsw
fdc9tam,"Definitely agree about this movie being stressful. The scene when Kevin Garnett returns to his shop to give him back the gem and gets stuck in the security entry way was giving me a headache almost. It’s very well done and accomplished exactly what it sets out to do. Sandler is great, his character is charming, insane, stupid and genius all in one. I would just say to be prepared for a movie that doesn’t have a lot of feel good moments, it’s just scene after scene of bad shit happening to this guy. 

I will probably never watch this movie again but I’m glad I saw it. 8/10",ef4qsw
fdd3mof,Did anyone else feel extremely uncomfortable or maybe even anxious watching this movie? And i mean that in a good way. I can't put my finger on exactly what it was.

A degenerate gambler story is one that can always be made interesting. I also appreciated the look in to the world of these people who hawk jewellery for a living. It seems like quite a fascinating though scary world. I can imagine it being quite cut throat as well and I’m sure everyone needs a tough personality like what you see in the movie to survive in that business.

While the constant yelling and fast talking over eachother took a bit of getting used to I appreciate the realism. It was very tense and anxiety provoking at times. Definitely kept me guessing. Great performances in the film and it seems like a movie where watching a second time will lead you to notice all manner of other things.

even when things didnt work out, howie always saw an angle to play. and in the end i think he had resolved to dying the second he decided not to call up his girlfriend to call off the bet. he planned it to be his final noble act of sacrifice to try and make up for a lifetime of fucking people over. it was probably the first time he has felt loved by anyone in a long time and was okay with dying as long as she had the money. so kind of a redemption i guess.

and the mob guy didnt give a fuck about the money. he plays by different rules and howie crossed the line by gambling money that wasnt his to gamble and the doors. the 2 thugs wont be able to get out with the jewellery anyways without knowing about the broken mechanism. also, the people in the building definitely heard 2 shots... so it is what it is.

One thing I’ll throw in that I don’t think I’ve seen on here yet - I don’t think including The Weeknd was just a “oh yeah it’s 2012” thing. The Weeknd is Ethiopian (Abel Makkonen Tefaye is about as Ethiopian a name as you’ll find) and I have to imagine that was intentional by the Safdies to tie into the gem’s origin.",ef4qsw

I've literally been stuck on it since I saw the movie a few days ago. Why would a supposed henchman, shoot the man who just made millions (and they could extort to pay back more money), shoot his boss and collected the plunder. I couldn't figure what the ending meant, I think I told my boyfriend something along the lines of ""dont trap a sociopath in a small enclosed space"" but it didn't really hit me that when he trapped them in the bullet proof chamber it was the biggest gamble he made throughout the show. Not getting the gem, KG, or betting KG's money, he bet his life. And the movie had me the whole time, I was invested. Remembered the characters names. And totally thought I had it figured out. Thought he had it figured out. Overall it was really well done and made me feel a range of emotion. But there were quite a few fantastic movies this year e.g. just mercy, parasite, 1917.",ef4qsw

And I don’t mind that.  It would’ve been interesting to see him get a Oscar nod but I see why he got the snub.

fck56c5,"I enjoyed the movie. It has a slow start, but it becomes progressively more interesting as you see how unhinged Howard was in his gambling addiction leading up to his death. In some ways I wasn't surprised, the goon who shot him clearly hated Howard after dealing with his shit throughout the film and culminates with being locked in that room. Moreover, the movie wasn't going to espouse the idea that being a gambling addiction and being unpleasant was going to lead to payoff.

The scene where Howard has a breakdown in his office before Julia comforted him was probably Adam Sandler's finest performance moment in his career.

I should also meniton that Kevin Garnett is surprising a decent actor, which is a huge plus given how big his role was as oppose to being just a cameo.

Fast-paced, anxiety-inducing, and kind of funny too. The cinematography is amazing and the Safdie Bros keep getting better. (I loved Good Time too so).

Adam Sandler can play a dramatic role if it's the right material and this was. He was BRILLIANT! I felt bad for him initially because of his bad luck (or stupidity).

First, there are a few scenes in the movie(think Howie coming to Julia's apt a couple of times, Howie going to take the trash out, KG and his buddies not returning the stone momentarily, Julia probably scamming him and running with all the money in the end etc.) that starts off like it is going to be a cliche -- someone's gonna come from behind and hit him, he's gonna get cheated, he's gonna get hurt, his wife is gonna create a scene.. but everyone of those scenes surprises by being quite the opposite. I used to feel I'm getting anxious the obvious is going to happen and it dint. So towards the end of the movie, I stopped predicting what's gonna happen next, instead I just followed along, whatever came I acknowledged. This brings to my second reason, the ending. Because I stopped anticipating things, this one was a real surprise but it dint shook me. watching this movie was a different experience, maybe it taught me how to watch movies differently? idk, overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",ef4qsw

Also I noticed something odd during my first watch that I later confirmed after watching the scene again. When Howard initially holds the opal and says “Holy shit, I’m gonna cum” they digitally shrink his eyes a noticeable amount right as he says “cum”. No idea why they did that, but it’s obviously intentional and one of the funnier things I’ve seen in a while.",ef4qsw

I also loved how many times my expectations were not realized. Not sure if the Safdies meant for them to be red herrings or not. Adam Sandler was phenomenal. His best serious role to date.

Before the movie even begins, Howard’s wife, Dina, has already walked away from him. She may still be somewhat involved in his life, but she’s removed herself as much as possible. She continues to uphold that barrier no matter what he does to try and convince her otherwise. 

Demony walks away when he realizes Howard’s been pawning off other people’s possessions. He doesn’t try to get his money back for his watches or his time, he just knows that this is the time to leave. 

One of the biggest examples, KG doesn’t buy the opal in the auction because he realizes it’s just not worth it, even though he genuinely seems to believe it would make him a better player.

Clearly they were trying to make this as anxiety-inducing as possible and they succeeded. The ending especially was a gut-punch. Overall, a really well-made movie.    

That being said I can see why the audience score is just a 52% for this on Rotten Tomatoes. Definitely will rub a lot of people the wrong way given the tone, cursing, and violence.

Thought it was as good of a performance as Joaquin Phoenix’s in Joker. Hope to see them both nominated for Oscars.,ef4qsw
fdw55cq,"As someone who was blown away by Good Time and immediately sought out Heaven Knows What and Daddy Longlegs, seeing the opening of Uncut Gems with it's huge Ethiopian landscape and scores of extras brought a huge smile across my face that the boys had graduated from guerilla street shooting to an epic opening like that. The camera got closer and the crowds of people shouting loudly and gesticulating around the wounded man. Thinking about it later on, this scene felt like a macrocosm of the entire film. The way the wounded Howard was the center of all these people shouting around him.  Just a fantastic cinematic experience from start to finish.

It was very well done.

Of course, I saw that ending coming over an hour earlier, but I don't think it was supposed to be a surprise. It was like we were just supposed to watch him gamble his life time and again with a sad and silent disappointment. So many decisions he could make that would end him in a better place, but he couldn't help being who he was.

During Thanksgiving, my aunt invited her close friend and new boyfriend over to celebrate and have dessert with us. The boyfriend was a HARDCORE gambling addict. As soon as he walked in we started discussing the Bills/Cowboys game. Not even 5 minutes in he became so convinced that Dallas would win on Thanksgiving that he called his bookie up and put $500 down on the Cowboys. After that, the Bills started dominating. 

And instead of this dude accepting his already huge loss he was gonna have, he called his bookie AGAIN and put another $500 down because the betting lines increased on Dallas winning since Dallas was down pretty big to Buffalo. Long story short, Bills kicked ass and won, and this dude was sweating fucking bullets by the end of it and trying to figure out how he was gonna tell his girlfriend he just lost $1000.

Firstly - I was impressed with KG's acting. *Especially* during the scene where he finally bought the gemstone. He looked genuinely disturbed when Howard was talking about the bet (also that scene does make me curious how sportsmen feel about controlling the fat of gamblers' livelihoods). 

It's kinda funny that a scene where Adam Sandler thinks The Weeknd (as himself) is fucking his girlfriend, and it's in a drama. Also side note, the actress for Julia was great. She's crazy hot.

EDIT - Another note, but I feel like watching the ending game kinda shows why people get addicted to gambling. The feeling of tension and relief were really absorbing and nerve wracking.

Most of what there is to be said already has been, but I wanted to address one point that's getting brought up by a lot of critics: **how the fuck are we supposed to cheer for or even want to watch Howie?**

The answer, in my opinion, is that he is driven and even optimistic. It's a common trope of tragedy.

So is Arno harassing Howard just for the principle of you don't gamble with someone else's money? It seems that despite the fact Howard is a compulsive gambler he still had money that he could have paid back Arno (has the house and apartment in NYC, don't think realtors take jewelry as payment).

Thought the movie overall was good, like watching a train wreck, that gets hit with a semi, and then gets crashed into by an airplane. But it dragged on a little long.

fr8h9q4,"Screw the metaphorical analysis of the gambling lifestyle Sandler portrayed. This movie wasn't meant to criticize any particular lifestyle. If you disregard your obsession with what is morally right and morally wrong, you may find the real hidden gem the Safdie Brothers gave us. pun intended. 

Adam Sandler's goal was to make it big, pay his debts and make that million dollars he always dreamed of. As much as the film focuses on him , we must understand that his drive, and his ultimate goal was ""to win"".(noone even knows whether he would stay with his wife or not: not his true goal)  All of us undoubtedly agree the KG and the Celtics victory that year was one of the most Epic victories of all time. The reason the Safdie Brothers intertwined Sandler and KG is because in both narratives they doubted themselves and let the people around them influence them. Although the majority didn't believe in them they stayed focused on their goal, and succeeded. KG didn't need a rock to help him win, he needed the confidence, the grit, the undying work ethic. Similarly, every time Sandler's character lost hope, what gave him an edge was the relentless effort to profit. The need to prove himself to others. 

Moreover, Sandler's death isn't a consequence of his actions, but the fault of a thug's greed. yea there are some connecting dots, but that is not indicative of a gambling lifestyle, rather the uncontrollable greed that drives violence in our country. 

In conclusion, the highlight of this movie is the ridiculous amount of passion Sandler has to achieve his end goal. Well done Water Boy. And to KG thank you for allowing us to see the no matter who you are: rich, famous or poor, persistence will get you were you wanna be.",ef4qsw

The way Sandler plays him with the awkward and nervous nuance is really brilliant and adds a lot to the film, especially its ending. I won’t soon forget KG’s line that $100k might be five lifetimes to an Ethiopian Jew, but $1 million is a lot more.

Every scene - the original jewelry store scene, the scene where they can't get the door open, the Weeknd scenes, the auction, KG returning to buy the stone, the end sequence, etc., were all masterfully done to unnerve the audience and just create an atmosphere of chaos, perfectly reflecting how chaotic Howie's life and struggle to maintain appearances of wealth was. Everyone is constantly talking over one another and interrupting each other, everything is just chaos. Admittedly, I also do a fair bit of gambling (though a hell of a lot more responsibly than Howie) so this movie was really right up my alley. The whole movie was really great, which in a movie with a completely reprehensible, unlikable protagonist, is saying a lot. The entire end sequence is totally invigorating and suspenseful.

It has the same level of acute realism that GOOD TIME had, a realistic gritty NYC drama with characters that are just regular people, people who you could easily meet on the street. The near-past setting and little details like KG, the Celtics vs Sixers game, the Weknd starting to blow up, all further assist in creating this atmosphere of realism, like these events actually took only a few years ago. 

I was a  worried for a bit that the was going to go the same direction as GOOD TIME after Howard kept trying to get the opal back from KG, luckily that was just a minor plot point. 

Sandler was amazing!  The accent, his unwavering confidence, his interactions with other minor characters. Yes, there's lots of yelling, but that's kind of his thing. 

Demany is a huge cunt, and Stanfield's portrayal of him was fantastic.

KG was a such a big surprise, and he was really good! Even though he was just playing himself his character had depth and his obsession wth the opal really contributed to the plot, as opposed to just another distracting celeb cameo.",ef4qsw

fslxbri,"I see a lot of takes on Howard being a fuck up, which in his personal life he definitely has, but see him some serious money moves throughout the movie. You could argue that none of the stuff would have gone wrong had Arnold not have canceled his bet in the first place. He consistently makes ambitious decisions that end up being correct but he's hamstrung by every person around him. His Garnett opal hustle was a spark of genius and he did it twice!!! Arnold screwed him out of it twice!! From a certain lens the story I got here was trust your family and don't bring murdering hitmen along if you don't want your family to be murdered.  


Which brings me to my next point, why didn't Howard call the cops? I remember he said in the beginning he doesn't have papers for his gems but the opal was gone and the psycho was obviously going to kill him because he didn't have a cut in the game like Arnold. Plus I don't know why Howard didn't see that coming having his entire store up for grabs. I guess the poetic irony is that even after winning the 1.2 million he just had to take one more risk by letting them in and ASSUMING they wouldn't kill or hurt him. Worked with Arnold but OBVIOUSLY not the guy who was hired to be there.  


Last favorite part I found to be subtle was when Julia came back to him with the tattoo and Howard is crying saying ""I don't deserve you"" he didn't mean it in as a compliment :/ He was so upset he had fallen in life to downgrading from his family and wife to an unfaithful girl that admittedly takes advantage of him.

The ending was obvious (maybe it was meant to be obvious). You don't mess around with a guy like that especially leave him outside the shop, sitting and watching the game.

And I love how much of a fucking scumbag he is in this movie, and how well he played it. The Safdie bros killed the direction and the script. The background cast was great from LaKeith to Kevin. I also loved the wife in this. She was super believable with trying to hold her boys together while trying to get away from Sandler. The mental deterioration of Sandler's character was great showing confidence, desperation, and never learning from his mistakes. He goes back to gambling in an instant, he always tries bumming shit watches, he goes back to Fox's character. Just so many layers, so much amazingness. I'd give this a 9.5 or 10. I'll have to buy the blu ray and watch again for the editing, but I just can't get over this movie.",ef4qsw

The editing of him rooting for the Celtics/Garnett and the intensity of the scene that led up to him hitting big made me so happy for him because he finally caught a break. When he got shot in the head, my heart literally left my chest. I felt so horrible and I had a feeling he was not going to get out of the movie without any repercussions but the way it happened was just so terrible for me.

What this means though is that the whole movie did a wonderful job of setting up that feeling you have for Howard. As scummy as he is you truly want him to succeed, and when he finally does... just like that, it's all over. All of it was for nothing. (Except for his mistress who is going to live a very great life now.)

Anyway, I cannot stop thinking about it.",ef4qsw

People here and elsewhere talk about Sandler being a good actor when he cares but this performance was Dustin Hoffman in the 70s good (in fact the movie shares a lot of similarities with Straight Time, an underrated Hoffman movie.) It's hilarious, it's thrilling and it hits you emotionally at the end. Perfectly captures how addiction (in this case gambling) destroys your mind. That scene with Garnett in the office builds so perfectly.

One scene that stood out the most to me was when Howard was in the club trying to talk to Demany and the dark lights made everybody’s clothes glow slightly, but Demany’s neon orange hoodie really glowed. So much so that it cast an orange lighting on the side of the people around Demany’s faces, which contrasted with the primarily blue lighting.

With the movie starting with the colonoscopy, I was guessing that he was going to end up finding out he had terminal colon cancer and then just stop giving a fuck because he was going to die regardless.

Sandler did a great job of balancing being a scumbag and not being enough of a scumbag you didn’t feel bad when he died.

I understand why the audience scores are so low. The CinemaScore when it went limited was A-, but when it went wide it was C+. It’s not a very pleasant movie to watch(although it’s a great movie).

fds133u,"I found this film to be incredibly grounded and therefore incredibly sad by the end of it. Howard is SUCH a loser with no real power, and I thought it was interesting that we basically met him at the same time as the guys that would eventually kill him met him, and got to see first hand how much he was taking the threat of their presence for granted. I respected the idea that his actions throughout were sloppy and his character was disrespected by most - It felt much more realistic to the type of person/types of actions that would lead to someone like him getting into the position he was in in the first place. While the setting was cramped and the stakes relatively small-scale for a heist/crime movie, because of all of this moments like the transfer of the money from windows, or even holding Howard out the window were incredibly tense to me. I really enjoy the Safdie Brothers style of a camera just being in a room with these characters, trying to grab whatever shots they can (though obviously everything is meticulously staged). Kevin Garnett was a huge standout/surprise as an actor, and my only gripe for this film has been that the Safdie Brothers trailers CONTINUE to reveal key images from the final moments of the film, which cause me to be anticipating those scenes to the point that the final moments become predictable. Still, the feeling of being addicted to gambling and how quickly triumph can be replaced by a gut-punch exuded from the screen without being too preachy or glorifying the vice at all. Great film. Understand why it's not being recognized by award shows, but failing to understand why so many people proudly walked out in the first 20 minutes. Looking forward to the next Safdie Brothers project, and dare I say, next Sandler project as well???",ef4qsw

fg7i3jk,"What did you think the movie is about?

To me Uncut Gems is a deep analogy on what constitutes one self; from the beginning with the scene that goes inside the shine of the gem, and then turns out be the interior of Howie’s; the Safdie brothers made me look at their picture as a (pretty well executed, in my opinion) tentative to expose in a thrilling way part of the raw and undeniable human nature and essence of survival. Starts with the ethiopian miners, taking advantage of the situation that left the mine empty for a few moments; then it goes on when we see each of Howie’s maneuvers to make some money..
The constant stress the I felt while watching it, as if I was the one with everything on the line, depending on random events in order to breathe, was really well executed mixing the highs of howie betting and escaping.
The uncut gem reminds of something that is what it is and if you change it, it won’t be the same anymore, and to truly understand its complexity it is mandatory to know from where it came, it’s origins.
The same is done about Howie: the picture shows him from the inside, as it did with the gem, and you keep feeling as if you were inside of his agony, his incapacity of escaping from himself. 
It is explained where Howie “came from” when the Jewish culture and religion is shown and depicts the “mine” where he came from. What at least I felt as a moment of potential doubt on KGs belief in the gem (in the lockroom, at the interval of the game, succeeded by a weak performance only afterwards) was to me an analogy of a doubt on self-trust, a reflection on the capacity and power of himself (and extended to Howie and everyone else: are we humans really amazing or a fake rock with some few shining moments?) .
The difficulty that Julia felt in not cheating, the incapacity of Howie in stop his addiction; all constituting the inner materials that form the uncut gems that in the end we all are: part sand and dust (rock) part shining, but in the end we don’t really know if afterall neither the shining parts were even real.. 
idk if I made sense, I am in a hurry here actually but needed to share some of my first thoughts about the movie before they went away; cause I felt deeply connected to it, not because of any addiction or anything, but to the stress of making something work, and feeling the hard times of trying to not be my worst, and even doubting if there is any good for real..",ef4qsw

fcl3tto,"I keep seeing some ppl confused on why the muscle shot him. I have a few reasons on why he did it. 

He was already annoyed and mad with Howard. He’s been chasing this man down for weeks and has been hit, bit, disrespected, and locked in a cage for over 2 hours. It didn’t matter what Howard did. The dude was going to shoot him no matter what. He decided what he was going to do by halftime when he stopped screaming in the cage. 

Another reason can be jealousy. Here’s this guy you’ve been following for weeks and you see him as a pos. Cheats on his wife, scams people, and has no respect for anyone. Then you see this funny looking fuck win a million dollars? Fuck that. 


Last reason is “this is my life. This is how I win.” We just saw Howard give that passionate speech to kg on how he has to do what he has to do to win in life no matter who gets fucked. The henchman entire job/life is based on fear. Howard didn’t fear him or the repercussions. Howard kept pushing the line so in order for the henchman to win then he had to shoot him.",ef4qsw

I think that scene is much better interpreted as an emotional and hopeless low point for Howard where we see the depth of his bond with Julia than as a silly scene intended for comic relief.

fc5do21,"I saw this with my wife and while I really enjoyed it my wife did not. I don't usually have anxiety but this movie made me very anxious. Sandler was great and I was totally into his character. The movie is really about gambling addiction and watching this guy blow it then get a win. I don't like basketball but I was on the edge of my seat at the end. (However I am a Philly guy so I knew the 76ers have not won a championship in many years so if it was based on real history they were going to lose.) There was a moment at the end where it felt like he won and everything was going to work out and then boom. Totally shocked. I was confused about Arno - if he was in charge why did the other guys not listen to him at all? Also why did Arno take them there at the end? Arno knew the guy had issues with Howard and he had anger issue with violent tendencies. Are the guys trapped in there? The movie ends like 10 minutes before I wanted it to. I'm pretty sure the file fell down again, that's why Arno could not get out, so they are trapped. Even if they figure that out one needs to stay behind to open the door unless there's a key they find on Howard. Dinah said she was going to call the cops and there's gotta be cameras in there so I guess they are busted. Totally irrational decision but not surprising for that guy. 

Can anyone tell me is the opal worth as much as Howard though or as much as the auction house said?",ef4qsw

fcan8k8,"Movie was incredible. As a Celtics fan, every time KG was on screen, I smiled. I’m a huge safdie brothers fan, and loved the tone and pace of this movie. As an Irish catholic guy, it was really interesting to see a film like this centered around a (Seemingly) predominantly Jewish operated industry like the diamond business. Does anyone have any other recs for movies about Jewish families or maybe Jewish mafia type stuff. I found it very captivating. Adam Sandler will be nominated for an academy award, and the movie itself will be too. Sorry for the writing I’m in the car.",ef4qsw
fcj2b6q,"I went into this film thinking it was gonna be just okay or bearable based on the audience reception but I was surprisingly enjoying myself watching this most of the way through. This film is definitely not for everyone and Howard is kinda meant to be looked over as a bad influenced character, but honestly this might be one of Sandler's greatest performances because at times I was really rooting for howard especially at the end. The only real flaw I can pick is that the opening scene is really out of context to the rest of the film",ef4qsw

Win or Lose, Howard was gonna die at the end of that game,  he was too excited and happy for it to even cross his mind that the mob guys were still gonna off him once he released them from the locked room.",ef4qsw

fc14h3a,I was thinking that the guy who Howard gave the fake Rolex to (to sell for $15K) was going to come back and kill him in the end,ef4qsw
fcp2ng0,"The thing that got me about the film was that Howard was screwing over the ones closest to him (guy who gave 8 years to him and then quit once the bookee’s thug ruffled his shirt), his father in law (auction fiasco), Demoney (loaning off his watches without pushing them on potential customers like Kevin Garnett), and Julia to a certain extent (I seriously thought she was cheating on him when he hid in the closet to surprise her but was definitely surprised when she was literally faithful and loyal to him - sans that very suspect Weeknd bathroom “deal”).

I felt like Demoney (Demoney with the opal that he always couldn’t get back from Garnett) and Julia (Her using him for his money and access to high end materialistic stuff) were screwing Howard over but in the end he was just using them to further his own gain (Demoney bringing in athletes and rappers to his store and Julia possibly doing the same thing with musicians, models and such). Hell, he even screwed over his own brother in law. Wife. Kids. I mean he was despicable. 

All that said, I still wanted him to win the bet and gasped when he got the bullet thru the face. 

This movie had great acting and cinematography. I’m a fan of Adam Sandler’s dramatic acting (Reign on Me and Punch Drunk Love). Enjoyed Lakeith doing his thing and Kevin Garnett surprised me as well (black dont crack)... it’s crazy this is supposed to take place 7 years prior and dude still looks the same.  Also, Julia Fox.(OMG). 

Downside - i literally asked myself what was the point of what i just watched as the credits rolled. I was entertained but (as is my experience with A24 films) i just found myself pondering a whole butt load of shit.... hence why I’m here :-).

flyncp7,I loved 99% of it but the ending left me pretty unsatisfied. I was very invested in everything going on and everything seemed to come together at the end and all of a sudden something out of nowhere just makes it pretty much worthless. I understand his demise was unavoidable eventually but it didn't really make sense for it to happen that way. They just got their money back and even Arno was like Oh my God he did it and we're about to just go their separate ways. And why even imply that the cops are coming if you're not going to show them come. I liked the movie overall but felt the ending had too many loose ends and was more for shock value than anything else.,ef4qsw

fdne4pa,"Sandler's character had a surprising amount of depth. I understand why a lot of people commented that they couldn't relate to his character and therefore didn't care what happened to him, but I didn't feel that way at all. I went from feeling sorry for him, to being frustrated with him and thinking he got what he deserved, to even feeling some admiration for him. I think just because a character makes terrible choices and can be an asshole doesn't mean you can't and shouldn't root for the character. To me it just makes that character easier to root for, because you can either relate to them personally or through someone you might know. 

I loved this movie, but it stressed me the fuck out. There was a few guys sitting in the back of the theater I was in talking super fucking loud. I wanted to say something the whole time, but the movie made me so anxious that I assumed that if I did say something they would run up to me and beat my ass.",ef4qsw
fm4fwo0,"For me, it was completely unavoidable to ignore thinking about Scarface with all of the synth ""score"" playing way too loudly over the dialogue. HAD to be intentional, right?

The praise for Adam Sandler is so well deserved he can act his ass off when he wants to. The last half hour of the movie was amazing writing I didn’t think it was going to go there but the way Howard kept fucking with everyone that was the only way to end it. I didn’t even see Sandler in this role he transformed into that narcissistic piece of shit jeweler.

fcu1uad,"Loved it.

From beginning we see Howard getting a colonoscopy to check for colon cancer. He seems like he’s not worried and that’s the tone we get from him the whole movie. He is living life recklessly because he feels as if he has borrowed time. Him being shady and pawning other peoples stuff in hopes to win big all for everything to come crashing down is accurate when it comes to high stakes, it turns good people into monsters.

I saw someone say the theme of the movie is know when to give up or get out. Howard never did. His wife separated herself from him along with Stanfield’s character. They all know when to get out. Howard however keeps digging himself in and out, never walking away.

In the end it comes back to bite him. But it’s a good ending, he goes out quickly and on top of the world. The thugs may have gotten the satisfaction of killing him but it’s unlikely they escape. Like Howie said “This is how I win.”

When Julia was in the bathroom with The Weeknd...he was advancing on her and she was denying him but she said something like ""OMG how are you even that hard right now?"" after he moved in closer.

It's funny and sad. When he talks to KG about his obsession with gambling and KG is baffled (fantastic acting by a basketball player btw) by his high risk high reward plays, that hit it hard on a verbal level just how for off the cliff he is. Such a perfect movie, not just on a technical, stress inducing level with inter cutting sound design, editing and claustrophobic composition/framing but also on a thematic level, a masterfully told story of self destruction.

I thought KG was also very good in this, which normally is a big ask for a sports star. Being from the UK I think you could show this to people who have no idea who he is and you could convince them he was an original character put into the film.    

I liked Howard's cabal of employees too as it felt like each of them were a subsect of his character and it raised the tension level during every scene inside his jewellery store where everything was at panic station with things moving a mile a minute.    

I adore Good Times and this was a phenomenal follow-up, the high tension electronica soundtrack and the near-everpresent central character really pulls you into the movie and stops you from looking away or having your interest fade.   

Having been lucky to see this as the secret film at the London Film Festival in October I've been bugging all my friends over this ever since and as we're lucky to be getting it on Netflix during January in the UK it will be even easier to get as many people I know to check it out.",ef4qsw

He’s just obsessed and addicted to the chaos his lifestyle brings.

I went into this expecting an eh especially since while I heard he was good in this I've never seen a movie where Adam Sandler actually gave a shit and well acted but he killed it here.

At first the plot just feels typical, atleast to me since I've seen so many gangster and crime movies as I love the topic and such but it slowly blossoms into something interesting and real yet surreal. A story of a man addicted to the erotic high of gambling no matter the stakes who fucks over everyone around him and in the end irregardless of his major win he's shot dead all the same because actions have consequences. Leaving his loan shark brother in law who he owed dead next to him as he bleeds from his face in a looted jewelry store. His family hanging out at a friend's place and mistress making off with a million dollars that she hopes to bring to him. 

Still sounds fairly typical I guess but the visuals, insane synth soundtrack that will be in my recently played for a while, gripping acting, anxiety filling premise and emotional brutality make it one of my top films of last year. Worth the 2 hours.",ef4qsw

When the goons showed up at the kid's play, I knew Howie was finally in too deep.

Adam Sandler was superb. Just insanely good. He had me fully convinced he was Howie for all but maybe 15 seconds of the movie, when he was crying to Julia about how he screws everything up and didn't know what to do next.

At no point did I feel like I LIKED Adam Sandler's character. I felt sorry for the sad, powerless sack at the end (SPOILERS) when he's beaten up and crying to his lover, but that was 1 minute out of 2 hours where I felt a human connection towards him.

It was great to see the Sandman in something different and the whole atmosphere and tension was terrific. I was a little underwhelmed with the ending but maybe someone can provide their perspective.

Unless the ending was intentional, I was hoping we'd learn a bit more about where everyone ends up after Howard's death.

I know that we're on this crazy ride with Howard the whole way...him being yelled at, beaten, chased down...it's pure chaos, and then boom, it's over. I understand if that's what the Safdies were trying to convey. That you just don't know where everyone goes or if they make it out okay. But we are introduced to Howard's circle of enemies and his very few allies and become familiar with them.

In the case of Julia: she had to get back to New York from Connecticut with an incredible amount of money. Was she expected to return safely? Should we assume she'd be intercepted by one of the goons? 

Dinah and the kids: Were they safe after Howard's death?

Demany: He was slimy the whole film and it would've been nice to have more conclusion on his arc. We know he got a $10,000 cut for the opal sale from Howard to KG, but that's about it.

The audience was especially interesting... loads of teens and early 20-somethings who *love* basketball absolutely losing their minds watching Howie making these bets and repeatedly fucking himself over.

Sandler portrayed Howard, a deeply flawed individual with massive compulsion and co-dependance issues, with such ease I almost forgot it was him.  What I appreciated most about the film was how visceral it became almost immediately with the opening scene in the Jewelry shop. The panic and complete mania we felt as an audience was remarkable and incredibly accurate.

B) I really liked it a lot, I admired how it just kept the pace going the entire movie, weirdly reminded me of Mad Max with Charlize where you felt the energy moving the whole movie (minus a few scenes of course).

C) I was shocked they shot him and actually got sad for him that he finally got the big pay day and can’t resolve all his debts and go clean.

C.5) I kinda don’t think though that he woulda done that probably would have tried to use the million to make TWO million like the idiot he was.

D) At first I thought it was a bad plot device to have him killed like didn’t make sense, the goons should be happy they are getting paid, and that’s that. 

But then I thought about it and that was about respect, they didn’t give a fuck that he made million, they were just pissed he locked them in for 3 hours and he bit that one guy too.",ef4qsw

Overall I liked it. I found the story and characters interesting. It felt very raw and gritty and was tense from start to finish. But I left with a headache. Just the first 10 minutes alone was enough to give me a headache. The loud annoying music playing while the shop fills up with people all talking and yelling over each other had me wanting to walk out of the theater and there were several more scenes throughout similar to that. 

I can appreciate something different and as interesting as the story and characters were it definitely wasnt an enjoyable theater experience. If you want a movie that makes you feel irritated and uncomfortable then this is the one for you.",ef4qsw
fdp4qah,"I have mixed feelings.

Sandler? Of course he can act. We know this thanks to Punch Drunk Love and Reign Over Me.

It did build suspense but it felt for the most of the time it built to nothing except for the ending where there was no suspense and it ended so drastically. Reminded me of a horror movie where it would build for a jump scare and it would never get there and just randomly have a jump scare out of nowhere. I can't look past that.

However I like the symbolism with the movie starting and ending the same way in correlation with how Sandler's character doesn't change. Where it looks like he is going to do the right thing and leave the woman he cheated on his wife with and pay off the debt but it turns to where of course he's gonna try to make money.

Bogosian suprised me though with his acting. Thought his performance conveyed all the emotions without having to say much.

Also, I didn’t know Sandler was adaptable to this role. When I think of Adam Sandler (M/21) I think of a silly guy who can make you laugh but can have a serious side. This surprised me. I see Adam in a new light. I hope to see Adam Sandler in roles like this. The sefdie brothers gave me 2019 vibes.

Man I'm not even a sports or basketball fan, but that last game I was on the edge my seat same as Howard. KG was great too. I chuckled heartedly at the John Amos cameo, did not actually expect him to be his neighbor. The Weeknd one was pretty cool too, especially when they got into it.

fcxnvsk,"This movie was absolutely amazing, I will start with my only two complaints. 1. In the theatre, the part where they zoom in on the gem as well as the blood at the end go a little to far, hurt my head, (I’m sure it will be more tolerable at home on my tv.) 2. The extremely chaotic scenes where everyone is talking and yelling, I understand they are showing a cultural representation of Jewish families and their conceived loudness but I believe they went too far with this at some points as well. Now on to what I enjoyed! I believe that this film did a great job of integrating relatable problems and provides so many ways for the viewer to engage. My favorite example are Howards problems in each of his relationships. With his wife he is struggling to keep his family together although she clearly hates him. On the other hand his relationship with Julia is completely based around love and she proves that she will do anything for him, he ironically gets a taste of his own medicine when Julia is with the weekend in the club. Although his wife hates him, he is still in a separate relationship and it goes to show the madness and stress he was dealing with in his life. The three things that gave Howard happiness were his son, gambling, and Julia. I also love the gambling at the end, I felt like I had a million riding on the Celtics! Great jobs by the cast and directors. Lastly I really enjoyed the ending. SPOILER ALERT! I think his death symbolizes the happiest of endings for Howard. No matter what, it seemed as if no amount of money could make him happier, his addiction to gambling was truly his only form of happiness and the parlay at the end was the happiest that Howard could have ever been, and although he died, he died at the highest point of his life. There is beauty in Howard’s death, although he dies he was finally happy.",ef4qsw
fshqs0i,"I found this movie very difficult to watch because the main character feels unrealistic. He is too much of a fuck up to have all of this money, 2 properties, a mistress, family, vehicles, etc.. The choices are all so bad that it's hard to believe this person could somehow have made so much money to have all of this and still have such a huge problem they are barely making it and in so much trouble. Make him not so well off to begin with and it's a bit more believable.

The scene where he has the cash to pay the debt back, but sneaks the money away to place a bet felt a bit off. He calls this guy telling him come get your money, but then makes a bet with it while he is waiting. Why even call him to begin with? Maybe I struggle with it since I tend to think very logically about things and everything is this makes no sense. In literally every scene I am scene multiple better solutions.

This guy doesn't have to act logically, but the way he acts suggest a severe mental issue. He loses control of himself to the point of being taken over, losing all control and making impulsive bets despite the drastic consequences. It feels like more than just a gambling issue and a real mental problem to the point why would this man even have his own store. He is basically one step above useless at this point. Just barely at the level of being able to function on your own as an adult. Yet he seems to have had success at some point and fairly recently, but still all these problems exist. It's a good movie, but a bit hard to believe it all.

I got hooked on Howard's character, what a roller coaster of a life he had - geeze! i cannot imagine being in that position. 

Throughout the movie, I kept wondering ""how is this going to end?"" - the ending was very redemptive, played back that gem trip, that when we lose ourselves in an addiction, everything becomes noisy and we become lost in our addiction.

The Altman esque dialogue meshing with the break neck pacing and ever looming danger hovering over Howard made for such an anxiety inducing and stressful cinematic experience, which was released in such a depressing but inevitable manner. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it since it ended. The Safdies and Sandler made magic with this film.

Edit: Another thing I want to add in regards to Sandler’s portrayal of Howard is how he was able to make us root for him, even though he was such a sleaze ball and dumbass. He added such a tragically human and sympathetic angle to someone with a gambling addiction, and it’s easily my favourite performance of the year, and his best performance he’s ever given in film.

fcksvyz,"It took me about 20 minutes to adjust to the pacing of the movie. It threw you right into the fire and didn't wait for you to catch up. I will need to rewatch it for that first 20 minutes alone. I feel like I missed a lot just trying to keep up with the dialogue (especially that first scene in the jewelry shop). 

But once I adjusted, it was a hell of a ride. Some overall thoughts: 

* Sandler did a great job. That role was perfect for him. Dramatic enough to show off his range. But still zany enough to allow for some vintage Sandler moments.
* The score was awesome. An 80's fantasy score set in an almost modern-day thriller was something I didn't expect. But it worked for me.
* KG did a pretty good job. Wasn't ground-breaking acting. But it was believable enough that it didn't take me out of the movie.
* Lakeith Stanfield is having a good year. Atlanta is one of the best shows on TV right now, and he is getting a ton of exposure on the Silver Screen recently.
* The last 30 minutes...some of the most suspenseful film-making I can remember in recent memory. No real ""action"". But a masterclass in using dialogue, acting, a score, camera work and pacing to get a viewer's heart rate pumping.
* I'm sure the ending will be polarizing. But that was a fitting end for me. We all know those types of people Sandler was portraying. In a way, that was the best possible ending for him.

I say all that because it's pretty clear this movie is hitting better with younger audiences. On IMDB the 18-29 demographic is giving it an 8.3/10. The 45+ demo is 7.0. Not saying 7.0 is terrible by any means, but I'm sure a good number of them shared the same mindset as my mom did.",ef4qsw

Is the stress there as a gimmick or does it serve a greater purpose? I imagine the latter. Our “protagonist” is a man with a gambling addiction. He’s constantly on edge. The whole movie his mood is from one extreme to another, all dependent on how his gambles and trades are going. He’s an infuriating mess. 

If anything, the movie was certainly evocative for me. I knew there could be no way it’d end happily but I was still surprised by the end. It felt very senseless, but real. 

I do appreciate it as a whole, but it’s not quite my thing. I don’t enjoy feeling on the edge of my seat for the entire duration of a film, though I will say Idina’s character definitely brought much needed relief. Not sure if I’ll see it again.

fc9sb54,"I honestly hate to admit it, but the movie lived up to the hype.. Saw this movie opening night and have finally come down and made peace with the ending: He was either going out a winner or live on to be a loser again, it was the only acceptable ending for him.

Growing up in NYC and in having worked on in diamond district biz, it was interesting off the bat coming into this and was really curious on how the Safdie brothers were going to illustrate this world. Was surprised and loved the great job they did!! Never thought I'd ever see a story set in this world like this one. Everything was nostalgic and sentimental for me and reminded me of my young days working for the family business going from booth to booth, building to building, dealer to dealer, or hustler to hustler.

I also love and was freaked out by the symbolic existential and metaphysical feel of the stone. Loved how it was introduced into the movie: An opal excavated in some fucked up Chinese mine in Africa, zooms in the universe, then zooms outs into fucked up Howard. Later on, the way Sandler and Garnett's characters are so captivated by it and 'see the universe' in it? But the craziest scene was when Howard breaks down in his office all beaten down after the auction. He's sits in his office and just stares at in its box and starts rubbing it trying to desperately understand the circumstances this fucking rock has placed him in, almost like he's trying to magically get it to 'work'. It's feels so human and primitive, it's so well done. Also as someone who's lived with crippling depression, anxiety, and have been through many breakdowns, that scene hits home having shared those moments of hopelessness and despair. I can't help but feel for him, even though this is all his doing and how terrible he is. It's tragic.

I've read a lot of complaints about the noisiness and energy of the movie, but I personally love it. Maybe you couldn't keep up with it or it was too stressful? That's the point. The whole movie is a cinematic panic attack that keeps you on the edge of your seat and really shows you the scopes of addiction, his manic lifestyle, his circumstances, and the tension this dude has created for himself. Also can we talk about the score??? Was a little skeptical coming in when I heard Oneohtrix Point Never worked on it but now I can't stop listening to it. Killer.

fc7zkeq,"Saw this movie last minute because some friends were going to see it. Knew literally nothing about it besides it had Adam Sandler but was not a comedy(which surprised me, I'm not really a movie person so I didn't know he did dramatic roles).

Lucky I didn't do any more research because I almost certainly would have decided to skip it. I almost never enjoy crime movies. And I hated this one. 15 minutes in I was convinced that this was going to be one of my least favorite movies ever and it mostly just seemed to get worse for at least the first hour.

Slowly but surely though, the movie managed to transform Howard from an obnoxious and unlikeable character that I didn't care about into the most obnoxious and absolutely insufferable character I can remember. A character I cared about specifically because I wanted to see him fail and be miserable.

The turning point where I realized I was having a great time was the scene where KG is actually trying to return the rock but they can't open the door for a hilarious length of time. Then the scene where he tries to reconcile with his wife and she just laughs at how pathetic he is was great. I'm not a person who would ever initiate a round of applause during a movie, but I thought one was deserved there and was disappointed one didn't happen at my showing. I didn't really feel very stressed during the tense periods toward the end. Mostly I just enjoyed that Howard was stressed and miserable. 

The most worried I felt was after KG won the tip and had the points. I don't follow the NBA, but I do follow other sports so I inevitably hear in passing about which NBA teams are good and which teams win in the playoffs. So I knew the Celtics were very good back around 2012, and I knew I couldn't remember *ever* hearing about the 76ers doing anything notable in the playoffs. So it seemed pretty damn unlikely that Boston had lost game 7, and thus pretty likely that Howard had won his bet. This movie wasn't actually going to give him a happy ending right? Right!

It was a little bit of a downer when they killed his brother-in-law. Guy was an idiot to loan Howard any money, much less $100k, and generally didn't seem like a good dude. But he didn't deserve to get shot in the head. Oh well. I was happy enough about Howard that I didn't let it ruin my mood.

I don't know if I'll ever watch this again, but I'm very glad that I saw it this once because it unexpectedly ended up being strangely fun.

Edit: I also felt pretty stressed when that guy contaminated the fish tank. He was of course right to be pissed and to want to hurt Howard, but he didn't need to take it out on the fish 😥",ef4qsw

And it certainly won't hurt your enjoyment of this movie if you're a big basketball fan, because roughly half of the film is actual NBA footage and it's SUPER important to the plot 😂

And I've gotta say, a LOT of movies sacrifice tension so they can get laughs. And this movie has a lot of serious situations where people are in harm's way and you're very anxious as to what's gonna happen next ...

I think one's enjoyment of the film depends on how charismatic one finds Sandler and  how compelling one finds the allure of gambling (in my case, 'meh' on both). I also found the mistress was *way* too gorgeous to be believable as being so smitten with Sandler. Would have been nice if it was dramatized what she found so charming about him.

&#x200B;

I didn't feel nearly as much anxiety as some others in the discussion.  I'm surprised that some people are saying this is the most anxiety-driven movie they've ever seen.  Seriously?  The dialogue was fantastic but I wouldn't call it suspenseful.  If you have issues and get genuinely stressed out at more than two people talking with high tones, you're likely just a serious introvert.  I'm sorry.  It's not that suspenseful.  I just thought it was realistic for a guy in a situation like that.  I didn't feel my heartbeat racing when he was being chased or goon'd on.  It was like a mellow-dramatic pause of a slightly-above heartrate the entire time.  I was so drained by the character interactions because I didn't care.  I felt like I had no reason to.

&#x200B;

I enjoyed the film but it felt really flat and filler-ey at many points early on.  I am going to assume that because the main character is portrayed as being pretty stupid on decisions, I didn't feel genuine emotion when he did exactly what was expected over and over.  Or maybe I'm just washed out from the ""thriller mindset"".  At times it felt like it was meant to be a T.V. show instead of a movie.  I had trouble with early scenes where I wasn't really interested enough in Sandler's character nor the other characters.  Fortunately those moments were propped up by over-the-top acting, but the script was still very weak in my opinion.  Congrats on the directors for putting in proper twists, an example being the wife just saying ""no"" to his baseless request.  They didn't feel forced or shoehorned in.  If the twists were any worse, I'd definitely not recommend this movie.

&#x200B;

As for plot points, near the end I predicted him to die, sort of souring the experience for me.  Especially when the gun was flashed, I knew it was over.  However, I assumed he'd get killed by losing the match, and not in the way he did.  That was a pleasant twist, as well as the second kill in that scene.  But, again - I never really sided with the protagonist, so I just felt blank.

&#x200B;

Adam Sandler's performance was fantastic, especially with some of the dialogue he was given.  I felt that the actors really boosted this film up and were near-perfect for their roles.

&#x200B;

To finish off, I would recommend the film, but with caution.  I definitely wouldn't recommend spending big bucks on it for the theater.  It's very different, but kind of painful to sit through early, and the payoff at the end doesn't pull those strings enough to make up for the difficult first half.",ef4qsw

It never calms down until the end when that ridiculous gangster calms it down for you. 

The sound design and editing are designed to give you that anxious, desperate feel that is Howard's life. The technicals do a pretty good job of guaranteeing you a bad time watching this. 

Sandler does a good job here. It's not revelatory however. But he does a nice job. So do all the supporting players.

Great work from Kevin Garnett (!), Lakeith Stanfield, Mike Francesa (LMAO) and Julia Fox. She's talented, and super sexy. She's got the juice. Another great score from Oneohtrix Point Never too.

The second half has more traditional movie structure compared to the first and it definitely is not as loud and aggressive.

Now, I do think that many people are  exaggerating because they're acting like the movie is 100% anxiety inducing panic attack, and it does reach those levels, but it does have quiet moments and even kinda slow and boring moments.

I found a review that was positive on the movie yet it still had this snippet, which I agreed with: ""Midway through the film, Sandler’s wife finally snaps, and the scene falls silent while she tells him, slowly and deliberately: “I think you’re the most annoying person on the planet. I hate being with you, I hate looking at you, and if I had my way, I would never see you again.” It’s a relief to hear someone say it, and it’s the one tiny concession to catharsis in a film that’s otherwise a relentless bombardment of anxiety and apprehension.""",ef4qsw

He kept using other peoples money on gambling (which is a solid representation of a gambling problem which is the only thing relatable about him) but, he didnt stop even when his family was threatened (with the play). In that, he is a terrible father. He was a character that I couldn't get behind and there for I found it hard to be emotionally invested in the movie.

Not a fucking wasted frame of film. 2:15 that went by like an hour and a half. Cinematography and location shooting was grittier than even early Scorcese,  like a more technically proficient Abel Ferrara.

Their movies, at least this and ""Good time"", also has a interesting take on characters. The characters are not some extremely smart or unnaturally cunning ones, but rather impulsive and blunt. 

They act like you'd expect small-time crooks would, even when faced with much better options - because in the end, they're just impulsive assholes that wade through half-baked ideas and bad life choices. Both the heroes and bad guys.

fbzj607,"Was lucky enough to see this at TIFF at the international Premiere. The cast and the Safdie's were there and did an introduction and Q&A after. 

I am a Safdie Brothers fan. Truly. I think they are some of the most exciting directors around today. This film is no different, it's exciting and completely fucking mental. 

Adam Sandler gives his best performance since Punch-Drunk Love. He plays such a flawed but real character that builds to the anxiety of the film. The Safdies keep making these movie where the lead continues to make the worst decisions possible and while it's not good for my stress levels, it does make for an extremely entertaining movie. 

You can tell the Safdie's have a love for Basketball as well. And that's made very apparent in this film. At times it can feel like a love letter to the sport. I love how it centres around a real post season NBA game that happened in 2012, as if this story actually happened. I also have a soft spot for sports betting and I think people who enjoy it will enjoy this movie too. 

The cast and crew did a Q&A after and you can tell everyone involved is very excited about it. Josh called the film an exploration of mysticism and our beliefs of superstition and I can kind of see that. Adam Sandler was there and it was birthday so that was cool too. 

While I definitely think the movie gets crazy and it's ride for sure. I think there were moments where I thought they'd push it further. The middle gets a little unevenly paced and I think they could have trimmed a bit more from the movie. I love how it starts. I LOVE how it ends. I think I just went in with huge expectations and it got close to meeting them, just not all the way there. I still think Good Time is the better film. 

There is a lot to unpack though in this movie and I feel like I'm forgetting to talk about something. I haven't said the music is great yet, it is. I haven't said the supporting cast was good, they are amazing and make Sandler's job even better. Especially liked Julia Fox, this was her first film and she was very convincing.

Lots of thoughts about this movie even though I probably lost five years off my life from anxiety. Some scenes were absolute genius: a mine to stone to colonoscopy shot! The final ten minutes!

Also I think the plot could have been amped up even more - I thought the watch guy and Diman would be in the action at the end as well. It almost seemed like the auction was resolved too easily. I also wanted a Contagion style scene of how Howard engineered the opal getting from the mine to the frozen fish.

The entire cast does a fantastic job with Sandler absolutely killing it. The high octane energy this movie gives off is enough to send an average person to the moon. I loved every minute of it, Uncut Gems is my new favorite movie.

What an incredible movie, this is a borderline 10/10 from me, only one I've given since March 2018.

fc1wed5,"What an aggravating, irritating, annoying, fucking film.  

If I hear one more person say, it ""Added to the panic/anxiety."" or ""I’ve never had a movie fill me with such anxiety"" or ""this is the most anxiety inducing movie I've ever seen."" or ""made me so tense and anxious"" or ""it was giving me anxiety the whole time"" Or some other fucking use of the word ""Anxiety"" I'm gonna scream. I swear to god, get a bigger fucking vocabulary.

No, it was not ""anxiety producing.""  It was loud, obnoxious, irritating, annoying, aggravating, headache inducing and NOT in a good way. Not because the *situation* or the *characters* naturally created the situation; Anxiety producing is when you you develop a sense of unease and anxiousness about and for the characters *because of the situation the character is in* This was shitty film-making by deliberately having everyone constantly yelling and constantly talking over everyone else for no fucking reason except to force the ""everyone's yelling at everyone all the time, anxiety producing' dynamic. Maybe thats normal to you, but [it's not normal](https://www.euronews.com/2019/12/12/house-republicans-trump-impeachment-strategy-was-simple-distract-deceive-yell-view)  and only succeeds in creating a distorted sense of whats 'normal.' I had to mute the sound and use captions just to get through the god damned film.

If I wanted to listen to 2 hours of everyone yelling and screaming over each other, I'd go to a white supremacist march and get into the thick of the battle between marchers and Protesters. It would be as productive. More even.

The music. What. The. Fuck. Was. That? Not only was it too fucking loud, it was this constant, non stop, and completely out of place noise. It was more like I was watching a low budget Blade Runner copycat than a modern (ok, 2012) story set in NY.  Seriously. What the fuck? Are you trying to just piss me off with the constant noise??  Music in a film is supposed to *support* and punctuate a scene, *not* overpower the whole goddamn damn scene. Would the battle between Qui-Gon, Ben and Darth Maul have been better or worse with a LOUD 80's synthesizer Vangelis tune out of synch to the clashing of light sabers? Or maybe the whole fight should have been done in silence? Would that have been a better choice than Duel of the Fates?

On paper it certainly has potential but is so cliche, such ridiculous caricatures; tropes (The Jews in the film, the Goons who work for Arno). There are also so many ridiculously unbelievable plot points (Howard's gonna turn his back and ignore Demany digging through his safe to answer the call from his Dr? Really? After just arguing and shoving him away from the safe? How about shooting Howard at the end; with all the cameras and monitors? You think the Goons don't know there are cameras? Everyone's after him for 100k? And he can't pay it back? To be clear, he's got not only the house, but the apartment Julia's in, the Mercedes and ALL that jewelry in his shop he can use to get out of the debt...but he can't pay the debt??)

And Adam Sandler. Did he do a good job? Sure, he was fine, he was 
believable but that role also wasn't a tour de force of acting. Not by any stretch. *Any* actor could have pulled that off. You know what he did? He didn't crack any jokes, or make a goofy face, that's all. Everyone claiming ""Oscar worthy!"" Are you fucking kidding me?? You need to get out and see more films, then. And expand your awareness that the guy who does Billy Madison, and Happy Gilmore can actually play a role without acting like a moron, using a goofy voice, or cracking a dirty joke. Did you not see Spanglish? Tell me the acting Job Adam did for Howard was any different than John. Julia Fox, on the other hand, unless she's really like the character (which is a possibility) did a good job in her role.

Anyone who thinks this is a great film knows nothing about film and filmmaking, and certainly doesn't know great acting. You can like it (Maybe you see your own family, maybe you and all your friends yell over each other like this, nonstop, so **finally** you see yourselves onscreen) but don't confuse what you *like* with what's *good.*

And if you disagree, or think I'm wrong, tell me where I'm wrong; I'd be happy to hear you out.",ef4qsw

Sandler's acting was a solid meh.  Him being consoled in his office by Julia Fox was when I really realised it.  I just dont think he can carry a dramatic film in a leading role. 

Also, minor gripe -  Howard's character has absolutely 0 redeeming qualities.  Not necessarily a knock against the film if that's what you're into, but how am I supposed to believe that this guy ever managed to have any semblance of a family life?  From the get go it seems he doesnt care about being a father or a husband, so why would he have ever?

Nobody in the film outside of KG and Judd Hirsch are people to root for, but the combination of scriptwriting and Sandler’s enduring charm made me feel tied to Howard’s success. It felt like a fable or cautionary tale, it also felt like Howard could be cornered and beaten at any given point by any given shark he’s in deep with. Everyone brought their A game, Julia Fox and Adele Dazeem were particularly fun to watch also! 

A lot of people are going to be taken aback by the ending’s abrupt conclusion. Once the game is over and we see the reactions from Arno’s henchmen, you know something isn’t up. These guys aren’t making money out of this, so why would they do anything different than pop Arno and Howard as they clean out the shop. I also feel like I disrespected the Safdie brothers because I wholeheartedly expected Julia to move on with one of the most confident rich old horndogs I’ve seen in a while. I was very pleasantly surprised by Julia being engaged in the game and ready to celebrate with her one true match.

I’d sauce this a 9 or 9 and a half. The movie is so fast that I’ll have to rewatch to confirm just how fantastic it was, but the Safdie brothers have further proven they’re the new dark horse in the game. Will always be looking forward to their next projects.",ef4qsw
fc0w9ai,"My ★★★★½ review of Uncut Gems on Letterboxd https://boxd.it/U13YJ

Really fantastic in every way. Sandler is an absolute powerhouse in this, he completely owns the film in what I might say is the best performance of the year in my opinion. I love the Safdies filmmaking style, and this seems like a perfect progression from Good Time. Howard Ratner is an unforgettable character, you don't doubt for a second that this is this guys life and world. The world around him of the diamond district also feels so alive, there's not a second where something isn't moving in someway really, and that's the world Ratner thrives in; one in constant motion. Hes a scumbag throughout, does horrible things, and is just a general asshole to all his loved ones but the film makes you want nothing more than for him to just capture a win, for even a second. Even though you know he would be back to square one just as quickly, I still desperately wanted him to succeed. The cinematography matches the tone as well as the Safdies style perfectly, allowing what feels like a peek in to this forbidden world of money and crime. The music is fantastic too, OPN killing it just like with Good Time. The use of basketball footage I think was also notable, and how it was incorporated made me feel like I myself had money on the games, you feel so invested in the stakes. Definitely can see it being a hard watch for some, but honestly it wasnt as relentless as I expected. So much yelling and it has to be close to the record of using the word ""fuck"" per minute.

I find their visual style and soundtracks really offputting. Sandler is great in this as are some of the supporting performances, and I think I would have loved the ending in a movie that was more to my taste stylistically.

Now if you loved Good Time but haven't seen this yet and are reading this for some reason, I think you'll love this.  If you didn't like Good Time I think this is a bit more accessible but I think most people that didn't like Good Time wouldn't like this.

fco656e,"Okay so I went to see it a second time and have some new thoughts and criticisms: 

I misjudged Arnold’s muscle the first time around but the guy who killed him was jacked from the very beginning. I’m not really surprised he killed Howard once let out of the locked room. 

I don’t think Arnold realized how serious his own muscle was until they were hanging Howard out the window. At the school play he’s the one telling his goons to take off Howard’s clothes and specifically says take the underwear too. 

The initial 6 team parlay was insane and I can’t believe they didn’t spend more time on that. It got kind of lost in the chaos. However 6 team parlays literally never hit and when they do at a 40k bet you’re talking minimum 1.5 million. Howard’s reaction of winning doesn’t match the payout. Thought more time should’ve been spent on that and later the realization the bet wasn’t placed. 

And another gripe that’s already been touched on is the auction. Had there been no correction KG was planning on walking in there and the Opal was valued at 750k. He’s already priced out before he sits down. So it’s ridiculous that he would on game day not go through with an extra 25k. its an easy fix for the movie had the correction priced it at say 250k-300k. Make it logical why KG says no. 

My reaction the second time around is it was a little slower than first viewing. I still don’t like the music for this movie. It worked in some spots but didn’t in many others. 

And for some reason I was hoping maybe the goon doesn’t shoot Howard this time haha. Maybe it’s my stress in other parts of my life but I started tearing up as soon as Howard was killed. Can’t explain it I just saw the movie 5 days ago.",ef4qsw

Maybe it was just part of the dark humor and all, but seeing Howard so psyched after the Celts pulled off the win for him only to immediately get a bullet in the eye socket just kind of had me rolling.

The entire thing was insane and awesome.  The directors deserve a ton of credit for making the whole thing feel like you're anxious and living in Howard's mind.

fd10vh4,"I read that the role was originally written to be for Amare Stoudemire, who is a Jewish (by conversion) African-American and kind of a weird guy who is heavy into mysticism and stuff like that. Presumably if it was Amare it would be more clear that the gem connection was purely a mental thing that was the result of the kind of type of guy he is. That probably would have made a LOT more sense than having Kevin Garnett in that role, given that KG is generally an intense hardnosed no-nonsense kinda guy (and not Jewish, and as such not having a direct connection to it.) Having KG suddenly having some mystical connection to the stone kind of gave off the impression that something supernatural might be occurring, which was a little strange. 

With that said I don’t mind the change and am glad it ended up the way it did because Garnett is actually really good in the role. He pulled off the dramatic scenes really well and has a seriousness and intensity that fit the tone of the movie perfectly that Amare probably wouldn't have.",ef4qsw

They had no reason to kill Adam Sandler other than the stereotypical “bodyguard mad. Bodyguard no think much. Me shoot money man and boss”. Up until that point the film has been constructed much more intelligently. 

It would have also been more interesting had the fake-watch man not been a pure misdirect. A departed style ending with him coming up on top would have added beautiful to the theme of the film and ridiculousness of it all.

fcsnwio,"The movie was a huge disappointment for me. 

I, for one, did not want to see Howie succeed. He had zero redeeming qualities. Zero. He was pretty much a wheeling and dealing scumbag who used and abused everyone he came into contact with and I couldn’t wait for him (the character, not the actor) to get shot in the face - and I’m sorry it took so long for it to happen.  I didn’t think of him as an antihero, as others seemed to,  but as an irritating, shifty conman. 

The story was ok and the acting was good, but the everyone-talking-over-each-other thing was unbearable and gave me a headache to the point where i almost stopped watching. I get that some situations/scenes are like that but every single scene?! Also, wtf was KG doing with the opal? Just keep it in his friggin pocket? 

Sandler’s acting in a serious role - while impressive - just wasn’t enough to make the movie what I’d hoped it would be. And it certainly wasn’t the edge of-your-seat thriller that it was described to be...unless you were on the edge of your seat waiting for everyone to shut up.",ef4qsw

it’s as if all the filmmakers wanted to do was see how far they can pull the slingshot that they put the audience in before the rubber band either breaks or they let it go and let the audience fly as far as possible... except in order for that to even matter the audience actually has to give a shit about the protagonist, and the filmmakers don’t give a reason why we should give a shit about Adam Sandler. 

the entire world of sports gambling, the rare gems market is fascinating, but the movie makes no effort in introducing this world to the audience. it just assumes everyone knows what it is and what’s involved in it. 

the best scene in the movie? when the entire family is having their passover dinner. why? because it’s the only time the movie takes a breather and makes some effort to show who these people are. 

so did they make the movie tense? somewhat, but not really, because whether or not Adam Sandler pulls of his scheme or fails spectacularly doesn’t matter, bec the movie never shows us why it matters.

What an incredible experience. I’m a huge longtime fan of Daniel Lopatin/Oneohtrix Point Never and I had checked out some of his Uncut Gems score before seeing the film, but experiencing the score with the film was fantastic and the score truly helped immerse me in the film and Howard’s world. I felt the same anxiety and heart-pounding thrills I felt when I first saw Good Time and this film didn’t feel like 2+ hours to me at all.

We don't have the fate of the earth or even NYC hanging on the outcome but the life of one man and possibly his family. Instead of our main character using his powers to get out of bad situations he uses them to further get himself into trouble.
Yet the emotions this film elicits is just as intense as the biggest blockbuster. You are taken from one intense situation to the the next in a break neck speed constantly praying for our character to make it out somehow.
Huge props the Adam Sandler for getting us to cheer for such a huge scumbag with almost no redeeming qualities.
This is not a film you leave feeling triumphant this film hits you like a prison sock full of hard objects. You leave this film like you had a stressful day at work.

fd0t1ct,"It seems that many comments here are forgetting one key fact about the movie... At the end of the film, Howard wagers the cash he owes to others, not his own. By instructing the others to meet and explaining that he had their payment... well those men were paid in the form of a wager, which I think is an important and intentional fact.


I took the main theme of the film to be about fitting in, rather than one about addiction as several others have argued. It seems that no one takes Howard seriously or treats him with any respect. He appears to be a man who does not fit in amongst any of the people closest to him. It is established that his wife and daughter hate him, his brother-in-law thinks he's a fuck-up, his clients treat him as a joke, and his mistress lies and cheats on him. His son may indeed admire him, but mainly as it relates to gambling. Throughout the film, he demonstrates that his idea of his ""self-worth"" is very literal, which by improving through profitable ventures he hopes will lead to acceptance by others.


To gain this acceptance, he justifiably uses the skills and tools he knows best: negotiating and determining value, as it relates to items, bids, or placing bets. For example, he knew that his clientel included black celebrities who viewed him as ""funny jew"" (or something similar), which is why he was interested in the idea of ""african jews"" and the related opal stone in the first place - in his mind, a high value at auction would cement his position as jeweler for the boston celtics. Meanwhile, other encounters such as interacting with his kids (unless through gambling), do not hold nearly as much value. While he would like the admiration of his children, this cannot be achieved by similar increases in profits, and are thus less important.


So his final wager is not only a great bet, but by placing it without his brother-in-law's consent, he is assuming power over him. In his mind, he has been given the power to ""taketh"" and then, through his own ingenuity and cunning, ""giveth"" the winnings on his own terms. His hope was for the men trapped in the security area to be so grateful to their benefactor, that Howard would finally achieve the respect and validation he deserves.",ef4qsw

grab an AR from the backroom safe, get the two thugs to leave out the front door, then unlock the door to yourself for your brother. fuckin ridiculous.

i get that wouldn't have been ""as good of a story"" or the Safdie brothers style, and also that Howard was on a gamblers high, but still, as a gun guy, that end was goddamn embarassing.

fc27v70,"I had high hopes for this one.   
  
No hate against Adam Sandler who gives the best effort I've seen him put out in years but the movie is kind of a mess. It's overly long with scenes that go nowhere and threads that have zero payoff. Some might appreciate misleads like that but they only serve to bury a story about addiction without being utilized to serve it.   
  
Example: Howard's kid finds out he has a mistress on a bathroom trip. Nothing happens.  
A guy needs his MJ on a cross necklace back from Howard. He tries him once and gives up. A guy is on Howard's case about a fake Rolex. He tries a few times in a small way and is never seen again. Demany disappears for most of the third act. Howard owes Gooey money. Nothing comes from this. Howard's employee quits to work as a rival. Again, nothing.  
  
The characters themselves feel cartoonish. Adam Sandler kind of works because he is the lynchpin of personality but everyone else comes off like they're Simpsons characters/caricatures (Shoutout to creepy Vegas-esque rich guy deus ex machina) and they aren't threatening enough to his way of life that you constantly feel like Howard is in danger. It never quite reaches that level of tension that *Good Time* did and it never quite fleshes out it's commentary about gambling addictions either.  
  
I have nothing against the John Carpenter titles and soundtrack but it really didn't feel like it fit in this movie.  
  
I find a hilarious irony in that one of the movie's themes really succeeds on a meta level because it has mastered the art of the con. It seems to have everyone convinced that this movie is worth a million dollars. That it's a real watch. When in reality it's a 100,000 movie. It's a fake Rolex. Everyone is gushing about *Uncut Gems* and everyone is commenting on the stunning inner workings of this *Uncut Gem* while the movie laughs at them not realizing they are actually being dragged through Adam Sandler's asshole.

There’s nothing he does in the movie remotely good (no save the cat moment). He’s just an unrelenting shit bag and the only investment the audience has in him is that he’s played Adam Sandler.


You need to like the main character of a story to want to continue. Even a villainous main character needs to have something you like about them to feel a connection. Without that there’s no point. If he was at least a good father or friend you’d root for him a little but the entire time I’m asking myself “why aren’t these guys beating him in every scene?”


That’s not good writing from a character perspective. 

Sandler is good in this, but I just really didn’t care about Howard at all.



I didn’t walk out of the theater but I would’ve turned it off and watched something else if i had seen it on Netflix



Edit. After reading the synopsis again, he’s not balancing family. He’s inconvenienced by them. He’s never shown caring about any of them unless it happens to coincide with what else he has going on



Edit 2. Going to address replies here but I’m not saying you can’t identify with the character I’m saying that a fundamentally speaking you need your main character to have an instance that makes them likable. It’s bad writing if you don’t. Could’ve had him tip a waiter big after feeling ahead or buy his kids something but he doesn’t.

That said, I wholeheartedly concede that I might be wrong and it's just a cultural difference (I'm Norwegian)

Overall I like the movie, but the sad undertones in almost every shot as well as the plot made the ending twist very predictable, 3 minutes into the movie I leaned over to my wife and said ""you numbskull, it's the wrong movie, this is some African blood diamond movie"" 10 minutes of her mocking me later I leaned in and say ""he's gonna get everything he wants in the end and then die"".

A lot of people talked about how tense and anxiety inducing the movie is but I didn’t feel that until they hit the Game 7 stuff. I liked Sandler but he didn’t blow me away or anything. Julia Fox in lingerie was probably the best part of the movie honestly. This was a 6 or 7 out of 10 for me,ef4qsw

Sandler is great. KG is an unexpected treat. And it’s very intense towards the end. I’ll agree with those sentiments I’ve read elsewhere.

fc1srlh,"This is an odd one. It’s so vulgar and offensive, I thought it was step down from good time. Every decision made by Sandler was more absurd than the last. The movie literally makes no sense. I found it a thrill ride, I found it hilarious in a bad way.",ef4qsw

Watching this film I asked myself multiple times ""When will the yelling stop?"" The filmmaker's answer seems to be, ""When you are dead or divorced.""",ef4qsw
fcmj1g0,"So I just got back from seeing Uncut Gems for the 2nd time. I also went to see The Joker twice this year for the same reason: to relive the thrill of anxiety-induced, tension-building realism. (Both movies also happen to have phenomenal cinematography and a unique visual style). While I loved the Joker, the 2nd watch was a little sluggish because it's a multi-part epic and I already knew the big scenes and plot twists. The Joker also relies heavily on Arthur's slow descent into madness. Uncut Gems however, is more of a consise, steady build of tension that doesn't rely as much on character development. The story is built upon a string of bad luck and poor decision making, which lead to the Safdie brothers delivering exactly what they intended: a stressful experience. 


After reading negative user reviews and hearing a wide range of opinions on the movie, I sat in the audience for my second viewing and studied the crowd for the big scenes (I swear I went with a friend who wanted to see it; I wasn't there for research). There was some giggles for the funny scenes, but right around the time when the auction goes sour, is when I heard all the murmuring in the crowd... ""Where is this going?"" ""This is terrible"" ""I want my 18 dollars back"". It was at that point I smirked and thought ""I can't wait for this ending to shut you all up"". 


Of course... I was right. Everyone in the theatre gasped as Phil pulled the trigger, and all of the people that were bitching got real quiet.


What was incredible was that even though I had already seen it, my heart was literally pounding from the second KG walked into Howard's office to buy the opal. The Safdie brothers subtly (and brilliantly) flashed a shot of Arno and his men waiting outside though the security camera, but the audience (and Howard) are so consumed with the sale to realize that it was Howard's impending doom.


Once the credits started rolling I started hearing exactly what I expected: ""that was terrible"" ""that was too much"" ""I was so on edge"" ""I told you we should have went to see Frozen"".


Which brings me to my thesis... regardless if you enjoyed the movie or not, or whether or not you seek anxiety-induced cinema, Uncut Gems is a pure adrenaline packed roller coaster that got people out of their comfort zone. 


Personally, I fucking LOVED that there were people in the audience who didn't get it. I guess it makes me feel validated that only a handful of people (and 93% of critics) are comfortable getting a little uncomfortable. It also confirms that A24's push to get more complex, thought-provoking movies into theatres might only be for a select audience that truly appreciate artistic cinema.


As for my personal take on Uncut Gems, I think Sandler and the Safdie brothers really pulled it off. Adam did a great job taking on the character of Howard, and it was incredibly refreshing to see him thrive as an actor in this epic story. The world that we were submerged into was unforgettable, brutal and most importantly, real. The cameos were excellent, Julia Fox was magnetic. I even loved Arno and his blank stare.


I'm not gonna lie, I too found myself wondering where the movie was going during my first watch (I just didn't verbally say it out loud because I'm not an asshole that talks during movies) but there was something about the ending when Howard and Arno die that really brings closure to the story. It's also an ironic exhale of relief because all of the tension that was building finally lead somewhere that did everything justice. I walked out of the theatre still in shock but it was only a matter of hours before I came to the realization that I loved this movie.


In 2015, I got high and saw Interstellar in a giant dome IMAX theatre opening night, and I passed out for like 20 minutes in the middle of the movie because I was so overwhelmed, nauseous and exhausted... And it was one of the most beautiful movie experiences I have ever had. I think I've been chasing that feeling ever since, and Uncut Gems did a hell of a job delivering a visceral,nerve bursting experience to reinforce my love for movies. Also it's great to see a beloved actor from my childhood return to form and not starring in Pixels 2.",ef4qsw
fc4vaee,"I didn’t really like the film, it wasn’t something I would seek out to watch again. If this affects anything I went into it without seeing a trailer and had no knowledge of the plot beforehand.

The constant chaos of characters talking/yelling over each other stressed me out. I understand that it was intentional but it wasn’t for me. I also didn’t buy Adam Sandler’s character. His accent bugged me and his acting felt forced. 

I didn’t get the anxiety towards the end either. I couldn’t care about the bet understanding that he’s a degenerate and would blow it somehow anyways.

The biggest plot hole for me was the bookie not placing the bet on the 6 team parlay because Arno told him not to. I’ve gambled for a long time and have never heard of a bookie doing that, it’s bad business. If Howard gets paid out on the 6 teamer everybody has their money. Obviously he’ll fuck it up again because he’s an addict but it would’ve defeated the plot of the movie. Maybe I misunderstood some bigger connection between Arno and the bookie but it didn’t make sense to me. 

Random annoyances: Mohegan Sun didn’t have sports betting in 2012 and still doesn’t. Also no casino will take a bet that big that quickly. They have to call upstairs to have a higher up verify it. I also thought the window Howard got on the pawn was very short? 

I did like KG in the movie, he was a way better actor than I was expecting. Idina Menzel’s resting bitch face every time she’s around Howard was great, culminating in her dying laughing in the dress.  Solid job from her. 

Then the ending. I’m 100% ok with Howard dying, but if that’s the move then why at that moment? Pull the gun out and tell Howard he isn’t leaving until Julia gets there with the money. Then when Julia gets there kill them both as well as Arno. Then walk out with all the jewelry and a million in cash. 

I’m not gonna bash somebody for liking the movie, it had its redeeming qualities, but it just wasn’t my cup of tea.",ef4qsw

fctj4cr,"I honestly didn’t like it. 

The first hour it felt like too much was going on. Howie was involved in so many scams, confrontations and difference scenes, it just seemed too unrealistic and hard to follow. 

Then the ending also frustrated me. I understand Howie dying, but who the fuck is the dude who killed him? Sure he was in the whole movie but we didn’t even learn his name, now he kills the main character and the “boss” of the movie. 

Howie never pays back his uncle or whoever bought the opal. We don’t learn what happened with Julia. The rich millionaire character was so cheesy. 

The scene where Howie and Julia are crying together in the jewelry office was really bad acting in my opinion.",ef4qsw

It was simple: what’s the stupidest action a character can take, and the most humiliating outcome that can happen? My guess was pretty much right every single time. When the writing is that relentlessly repetitive, it’s just lazy. 

Within 10 minutes I guessed it would end with him shot to death. I’ll admit at the end I wasn’t sure if he would win the bet or not, but I knew either way, there was no way the writers were going to let him live. The only thing suspenseful or anxiety-inducing for me was the music.",ef4qsw

I think it would be tough to watch a second time.  Never-ending suspense.  It just doesn't let up, and you have no idea where it's going or why and yet when it gets there it's all perfect and makes absolute sense.

I'm not sure how I feel about Sandler.  He pulled it off, but that might be because the sheer greatness of the film covers up his mediocre acting.  And it probably helps that he's playing a character close enough to home that it isn't a huge effort on his part.  The crying scene was a bit awkward (even the female co-star played it poorly) and his accent seemed to come and go.  He seemed to have started the film with a Borat character's accent (The Mossad agent from *Who Is America?*) but quickly fell back into his regular Sandler voice.  Just glad he didn't do the weird noises.

But part of me thinks that it being Sandler helps the character.  You kind of root for this absolute self-destructive fool because it's Billy Madison and you want Happy to win.  So despite his flaws, maybe he brings baggage to the role that makes it work even better than had they gone with a more talented actor.

The weirdest part of this was the PBS Science Documentary style throughout the film.  The music was straight out of a NOVA episode, and the way it was louder than it needed to be (along with the zooms into the microscopic world) made it feel like a science documentary which I guess makes you okay with the constant stream of ""where the hell is this going"" plot progression.

Sandler did well playing that scumbag character and it is nice to see some diversity in his roles. 

I didnt expect Kevin Garnett to be any good but good on ya KG!

Julia Day was very eye catching and had that accent down (she is from NYC I believe) and I was hoping this would be her break out role like Margot Robbie in Wolf of Wallstreet but her character didn't give her much to work with. Just a ""ride or die"" chick for Howie. 

I read some articles about how the production sought out non actors to play really minor roles and Sandler saying something ""some guys I worked with didnt know they were supposed to pretend to hit me"" but I don't think it improved the film.

Sometimes it's not a good idea to let actors improvise, mouthing mediocre dialogue and talking over one another. John Cassavetes knew how to make those types of films, his imitators often don't.

Like Good Time, this film was billed as a thriller, but I think both are mislabeled. The Safdie's really make comedy-dramas, a kind of love letter to New York. But whereas Good Time portrays the type of New Yorker you hope to meet, quixotic and authentic, Uncut Gems gives you the other stereotype, the proverbial cabby banging on his horn and screaming obscenities.

fbzsyjy,"I saw the earliest showing I could in my area. I’m so happy with how ambiguous they kept all of the trailers. It led to so many great comic relief moments (the “I disagree... I disagree”) that made no sense in the context of the trailer but are great in the context of the film.

It’s clear to me now that the Safdie Brothers are powerhouses of creating amazingly stressful circumstances. I spent the first 45 minutes of the movie *needing* Howie to have the stone back in his possession as soon as possible. It wasn’t until multiple fuck-ups that I realized that that was the message of the movie. 

I thought it was such a fantastic exhibition of second-hand stress and frustration for someone like Howie, as I’m sure most can identify with the idea of not having control over one’s livelihood, but at the same time, the cognitive dissonance of being like, wait Howard is a piece of shit — he owes everyone around town and as soon as he gets the opportunity to redeem himself, he just doubles down. Just the fact that I found myself rooting for a piece of shit gave me cause for pause.

I had a few very minor qualms with the movie, starting with why Howie would let three thugs he’s held hostage, who wanted him dead before he even locked them in, back into the store after he’s won. I’d order hired protection immediately and have those guys escorted out of the building and perhaps throw them more money than owed for the trouble — wait for it to blow over. Of course he gets shot in the face, it was expected by that time, I feel like.

My only other qualm, I suppose, is that I wasn’t surprised by the climax at all. I knew halfway through that Howie had to die after just pushing and pushing his luck. Especially after letting Arnold and the thugs back in after winning. We knew how much of a hothead scarneck was. Knowing how Good Time ended, I knew there was no other fate for Howie. 

That said, the fact that I still somehow held out hope enough to be wrong about that to be on the edge of my seat really speaks volumes to me about these brothers’ talent. I think, however, they’ll probably need to come up with a different idea than another Tour de Stresse for their third film in order to stay fresh. I did, however, love the incorporation of such a specific year and sports series, not to mention how well Kevin Garnett did as a significant character.",ef4qsw

The story was good but it was directed in such a rash way, it was just a whole lot of mess.

I get that some people enjoy the high-paced and ramped up thrill and action of the film but if the action/thrill never amounts to anything, it leaves you feeling empty and that is how I felt. This film was like a Tony Scott film without effective build up... lastly the soundtrack is horrible, it gets you all stressed but for nothing. I'm not sure if the music score was bad or it was just used in a bad way.

Also, I do not recommend the film to anyone who has issues with anxiety/high blood pressure/any heart problems... this film cause you a lot of trouble and I was lucky to get away with just a small headache by the end of it.",ef4qsw

Like I hated almost every minute of it, I was genuinely left stressed and anxious and at times wanted to just stop watching because I couldnt deal with the yelling and arguing and shit  
I had nobody to root for, almost everyone in the film is pretty much an asshole to some extent. Like what is the purpose to any of this

Then the movie ended and yeah, it was a great movie. Would totally recommend it to mates

frxz1dv,"I feel like this movie might have gone over my head. Is it cause I don't do sports? Was knowing about basketball a big deal here (genuine question)?

I go into a movie expecting one of two things (and sometimes both): for it to have a message, or be interesting to watch.

As far as I can tell the message of Uncut Gems is a pretty barebones diatribe about the dangers of greed and gambling addiction (though a beautifully shot message, I'll give it that). But that's fine! Movies don't have to always be deep and philosophical. As long as it grips me in someway, makes me feel some sort of emotion, I think it's a win.

I was bored out of my mind an hour into this film. Sandler's acting was phenomenal, but the character he was playing was the Worst and the tension of the film seems to hinge on me wanting him to succeed somehow. I did not. The only people I cared about were Howard's family and Julia, and both of those parties are arguably a lot better off with him gone so he can stop dragging them around (emotionally and physically) and having debt collectors threaten their lives as collateral for his stupid actions.

If your entire film hinges on the audience caring about the main character, wanting them to succeed, then why would you not give him a single redeeming quality? If it hinges on me hating him, why would you taunt me with him getting away with it again and again in a way that is frustrating and unsatisfying? Am I supposed to be hate watching this film? I felt bad for him because his addiction was out of control and he couldn't see he was destroying all his relationships because winning was all he cared about. But that means the only good ending I could see was him SOMEHOW getting help. That was absolutely not gonna happen. So either he wins big and the movie's message becomes ""gambling everything is cool as long as you win eventually""....or he gets clapped (turned out to be both which is a twist I liked). Great. I officially am no longer invested. Slogging through two hours hoping it would be worth it cause sunken cost fallacy and all that, and the only thing I felt at the finale was brief satisfaction of the dude getting his just desserts and a lot of worry for the people he left behind that have to pick up his mess. Didn't like him, didn't hate him enough to cheer for his demise like with a proper villain, he was just disgusting.

I hope Julia split the money with the family, they grieved, and then they all moved on with their lives. Happiest ending they could really get, I suppose.

Major kudos to Sandler and everyone involved with the visuals of the film. Didn't catch much of the soundtrack because I'm HOH but I hope it was good.",ef4qsw

fcmffl4,"Just got a chance to watch this. I wanna say that before watching it, it was described to me as a ""gradual and building panic attack"" and that seems accurate. I really enjoyed how well they developed the chaos of everything, and I loved all the characters - how unique they felt (even a lot of the one-off ones). This is a great movie I'd say everyone who can deal with the stress of it (it absolutely *is* stressful to watch) should see.

All that said...  It feels like it's trying to say things about gambling addiction and mayyyybe priorities in relationships? But it absolutely fails and really saying anything. At least at my initial glance of it. Thinking on it more, I think the panic attack that is throughout doesn't let you actually identify a throughline or actively identify with a character (even Howard) so you're stuck going moment to moment with the characters. Fine storytelling, actually, but it ultimately means that all you're doing is being on a ride and you're done at the end. It's a rollercoaster in the most literal sense, a one-and-done experience that's super enjoyable while you're on it but there's not a lot to actually digest so at the end you disembark and do something else.

To be clear, it's a super good rollercoaster. I give the movie major kudos. Movies make me feel lots of things and this kind of stress, the way it did it, is new. I just wish it and it's ending (which I could do a whole other post on how the ending mismatches the core movie) ultimately *meant* more. It's Stephen King stuff. Great story telling but not aiming for depth.",ef4qsw
fcb0o1c,"I loved Good Time, so I was highly anticipating this, but this seemed like a lot of hype. Adam Sandler's performance, at most, was *fine*. I've seen him do better dramatic and multilayered moments in comedies like Big Daddy or Click. To say this is his best performance over Punch Drunk Love, Funny People, Men, Women & Children or Reign Over Me sounds like recency bias or changing the narrative. I know he's done a lot of trash Netflix movies over the last few years, so this is a big hurdle back to something decent, but he's always done great dramatic work and this isn't even in his top 5. His ONE great scene is where he's crying in his office, or when he's talking to his wife about staying together and she laughs at him. Other than that, there's not much depth to this character other than being an annoying piece of shit (which is ironically what we say he is in all of his comedies, right?). His addiction and ego pulls him to make the absolute dumbest decisions ever. Every character in this movie I just wanted to beat the shit out of and just stomp their face in for being so aggravatingly idiotic. It really ruined the movie for me and then it just seemed to have these pointless ass scenes that went on for no reason, making the run time 20ish minutes longer than it needed to be. And then an abrupt non-ending just to put the cherry-on-top for how genuinely horrible this movie is.

I gotta give it up to the Safdies. They definitely know how to create a world, but after this, I'm going to think twice about whether or not I want to go on the journey.",ef4qsw

fcmfqwk,"I liked this movie a lot but I felt like Arnold's muscle offing everyone was a cheap way for it to end. For a movie with so many moving parts it felt like they just lost it and decided they should just handle it themselves. I don't entirely blame them, he's a degenerate gambler and I don't doubt he would have found himself back in the hole soon but it felt chaotic and unnecessary.

However, maybe my dislike of the ending has to do with my expectations of how Italian organized crime are supposed to act in movies.

fd3ni37,"Like Good Time, I enjoyed the frenetic energy of Uncut Gems, but that ending... 

I don't have a problem with Howie dying. Like Good Time, the film sets up that things were not going to end well for the main character. 

It's what happens to the money that is disappointing. The film has a triumphant tone when the mistress gets away with the money like she's Jackie Brown, but let's think it through. 

In Good Time, the Psychiatrist is weaved throughout, so the fate of the mentally disabled brother makes sense and is satisfying. In order for the mistress to get the money, the film introduces the High Roller as a deus ex machina at the last moment. The mistress hasn't planned or strategized anything. She's the type to get a Howie tattoo and run around the city screaming her head off. She doesn't have the smarts to get away with the money for long. The film pretends she's achieved something, when she hasn't. It's a hollow win for her.

Worse, she's technically taking that money from Judd Hirsch's character & Howie's kids. Howie has left them with huge debt. Now the family is in danger, not just financially but physically.  The debt collectors like the dudes with the scraggly hair and other loan sharks will go after Howie's family. At the school play, we see that the family is not safe from Howie's close associates, what about the others who want their money? The film wants me to feel satisfied with the mistress getting the cash but the foundation isn't there. 

Solid performances, KG was great. The concept of the uncut gem was fascinating. The Safdie Brothers know how to bring a kinetic potency to their films. The ending with Julia was dud.

It felt like they were purposefully filming on a boat and keeping you off balance with no room for shots or dialogue to breathe, I just gave up trying to make sense of it after that 15 minutes. It would have been a different thing if I cared about any of the characters up to that point, and been invested in anyone's story, but it felt like an absolute mess of ingredients that it hurt my head to keep it straight. Skipped through the rest of the movie and was really glad I did as Kevin Garnett's performance in his dialogue with Adam Sandler's character at the end perfectly described how I felt about the way the directors were treating the audience by constantly messing with his head and bis emotions.. so I guess they succeeded?

From what I saw, the movie was Adam Sandler as a New York Asshat, unaware as to why noone likes him, and being an addict. To me there's nothing redeeming or sympathetic about his character, so in his high pressure moments (the tip-off in particular, but really the whole celtics game), I understood that as an audience member I'm meant to be feeling his anxiety, but I just didn't give a shit about him. He had done nothing in the movie to make me want him to succeed. 

Also I don't understand why people thought Sandler was so fantastic. His character was shallow and he gave a shallow performance. I honestly think any stereotypically jewish looking actor could have given just about the same performance. 

Julia Fox and Idina Menzel were the two best parts of the movie for sure, but Menzel didn't have good screentime. 

The movie had some good moments, but all in all it felt like a lot of action and build up with no overall substance. I never felt anxious watching it, I just kind of wondered why I was watching any of it - why anything in the movie mattered.

When Arno makes Howard call Julia to bring back the money, I feel like an underlying reason why Howard didn’t make the call was so Julia wouldn’t say anything that would tip off her relationship with Howard since Arno is his brother in-law. Throughout the film she always tells Howard she loves him so he might’ve seen it coming.",ef4qsw

fcjsxob,I have to give it a reluctant thumbs down. I think all the noise and chaos and jumpy editing diminished and distracted from what could have been an excellent film based on the script and acting alone. I was interested enough in the characters to stick it out even though the ordeal of watching it made me consider walking out several times. They should have trusted the story more and not relied on so much overstimulation to convey his stress. Being given a headache is not the diversion and entertainment experience I am paying for.,ef4qsw

Its like a high school film student trying to emulate Tarentino or Mcdonagh with the witty dialogue, snappy exchanges, and anxiety-drive on-screen action, except its fucking grating to watch and moves the plot absolutely nowhere. There was literally 5-10 minutes of pointless rambling while they were trying to get KG out of the vestibule doors... 5-10 minutes of Sandler and his girl screaming at the top of their lungs... 5-10 minutes of just nonsense basketball talk. It didnt feel natural or interesting at all and at 1 hour 35 minutes we were literally in the same fucking place as the start of the movie.

Howard doesn't just want to succeed, he wants to fucking feast and he'll burn everything he has now at one shot at thriving no matter how miniscule the chance of success is .

It's why every time he gets a chance to walk away  or  close a deal in some way if the slightest opportunity knocks he'll throw away the previous arrangement in order to win a new big bet . For example Letting KG borrow the Opal in the hopes he'll win a big ass playoff  bet  on top of its sale price instead of delivering the Opal to the auction  where he'll  just get a normal sell .

Good enough or just succeeding isn't enough for Howard and never will be , It's why he admired KG so much he mentions to him how he'll keep  Scoring as if a game is in question even when the teams win is secured .

For Howard it's the same concept a mindset of  "" I don't wanna win unless I win by 50"" . It's ridiculous , insane , and irresponsible but that's what really drives him as a character .  Sure Howard could have paid off his debts  but a wins not a win for him unless it's a big win .  Pay off a longstanding  $100,000 debt or possiblt Make over a Million dollars on a risky  bet ?

fg97zze,"I got the impression that he was a successful businessman at one point. Like in his 20s and 30s. He seems to get a lot of attention and respect from people who he isn’t screwing over. Probably always gambled, but he must have hid it better earlier on and it probably wasn’t a big problem. This is reinforced by fact that he has long term employees, a gf who loves him, family who love him, people who are willing to loan him money, etc... speaks to someone who was trustworthy at one point. 

But then, as addicts do.. he got worse and started digging himself a deeper hole. What we are seeing is essentially his rock bottom.. wife has wanted a divorce for a couple of years, getting beat up by collectors, employees and business partners finally leaving, his father(or was it father in law?) going from loving him to hating him in a day’s span.. and then ultimately getting killed and robbed.",ef4qsw
fdbpvak,"That's just not how addiction works unfortunately, the film shows at several other points that he owes money to other people (lakeiths character for his watches, the other goofy random dudes following him, the pawnshop that was still holding his ring, the friend that bid at the auction, the weekends necklace, maybe more). He was never going to settle up and move on... Any assets were just fuel for more gambling. If he had lived he would have burned all that down eventually.",ef4qsw

I've a feeling once he has his wealth signifiers (all that you've mentioned, but even the fishtank and the fish themselves) he doesn't want to let them go, because if he wasn't deluded he either wouldn't be gambling and hustling like he does, or would be in a blank room.

fc28e33,"As a guy who’s been around the block with sports gambling, this movie captured the essence of that stress and adrenaline rush so perfectly in a way I’ve never seen in a movie. I felt like I was right there with Howie, with everything on the line and a bet being the only way out. The speech about “this is me. This is how I win.” was so on the nose it’s incredible. I started my gambling after graduating and finishing my own athletic career, and sports gambling gave me that same anxiety and highs from winning that playing did. Huge fucking accomplishment from Sandler, I was absolutely floored.


The two scenes that stood out to me the most:
When he just has a complete and total fucking breakdown and let’s it out to Julia. Absolutely nailed that feeling of being in a complete fucking hole of gambling. There is not a feeling of hopelessness quite like digging yourself into debt betting with money you don’t have and a cold streak just puts you even further in the hole then suddenly you have to conjure up funds when the bookie comes knocking. The shame, the feeling of total helplessness, feeling like you let all your loved ones down. And also, the one you described. I had a stupid fucking grin on my face the entire time watching Sandler standing in front of his TV screaming because I’ve been in the same stance doing the same thing in a stupid parlay to bail out a bad week. The high of hitting a massive bet like that is insane, better than any drug I’ve experienced, and Sandler completely sold that. 


Also let me add that this comment, much like this movie, is a cautionary tale lol. Water always finds its level, the hot streaks are inevitability balanced out by cold ones and the house will always win. The highs of sports gambling are great but the lows are a further drop down.",ef4qsw

At the beginning, we see all the wonder of the stone and then the camera comes out of his ass as he’s getting the colonoscopy.

That’s showing how everything he was selling to KG in the stone (that it’s magical, it will bring you luck) was all just talk out of his ass - to get the stone sold.

Then at the end when we go into his head during his “happiest moment,” we eventually see everything that we were shown in the stone earlier. All that promise of happiness and luck.

Howard was trying to bait Garnett into wanting to buy the opal to begin with, that’s why he lets him hold it for a day, he was trying to lure a buyer from the outset. Almost every interaction in the movie is Howard manipulating those around him. Demany seems to be a hustler like him, though. It’s why he didn’t push Garnett for the opal, despite telling Howard he had it, because Demany needed it to keep Garnett happy while he maintained his own hustle, and Howard was now a liability instead of an ally. You can assume Demany told Garnett Howard said it was okay if he kept it since Demany was the point of contact between the two.

fc4ay4i,It's like 2008 all over again.,ef4qsw
fg3jyq6,"I just finished watching good time. It had the same directors feel(sefdie) but the theme for this was different, centred around gambling, illusions,like others said, anxietyish, stressful. Good times felt like hope, not losing hope. Fighting till the end(same aspect) but you could tell of the directors presence in the movie. The way it’s made. I’m starting to love the sefdie brothers and the way they make movies. I’ll keep an eye out for them",ef4qsw

fcjw23t,Originally I thought Howie was gonna pay off the goons with the opal money then gamble his step father's money that was getting wired to his account in the auction,ef4qsw
fc3kis1,"Yeah I loved that transition/realization where you feel that he just wants the situation to be done for and at times, he is quite panicked about the danger to Howard going too far (like when the goons hold him out the winfow). He is genuinely pissed about his money being mishandled like that, which leads him to hire the collectors in the first place, but the whole time he just wants to light a fire to get Howard to actually pay back. There's pain in his eyes when he sees Howie being a complete fuck up and just worsening the situation for himself",ef4qsw

fc6bp7k,"he was excellent. i really really loved him in the glass box, his little bits of relief were really nuanced, the way he showed both relief that maybe howie was going to get out of this and he would be able to stop chasing him down but also the infectious excitement of gambling and winning and along with it a hint of understanding why howie keeps digging himself into holes. he was great",ef4qsw

There’s a lot of implication that Arno is actually trying to help Howard not get fucked up by the goons, like he’s trying to save the guy even though he won’t grab the life line. Also, Howard proves from the beginning he will do whatever necessary to swindle his way out of paying them. The ending is them just being fed up with his shit and cutting their losses.",ef4qsw

fc0x1dc,"The goons have become increasingly frustrated with Howard over the course of the film, since they were hired by Arno to do a job and Arno himself is making their job more difficult. So in the end, they decide to cut their losses since they realize they have the jewelry store to themselves and also can finally get revenge on Howard for wasting so much of their time. Killing Arno is because he is just their temporary employer who has no actual power in the criminal world really, so as soon as he gets in the way of their score they off him. Wasnt psychopathic as much as it was professional criminals choosing the easy money that keeps their dignity",ef4qsw

fcinin1,"From what I got is Howard took 100k from Arnold for the stone. From what Howard said is the opal took way longer than expected which is why Arnold probably thought he was getting scammed based on Howard’s character. Arnold was forced to hire some unsavory people, once they realized what they did with Howard and with Arnold being his brother in law they figured it was over and done and may as well kill him and rob the place.",ef4qsw
fc0drki,"I assumed they were apart of some jewish mob family.  Hirsch got into a chauffeured Bentley after buying the opal so I kinda figured he was the Head of the family.

Arno was like a Captain and Howard was probably the black sheep who was into the black market jewlery business. 

Howard probably got in too far with Arno's money so Arno and the Family thugs are shaking him down.

But then that kinda fell apart when the thug >!kills Arno at the end.  That'd never happen in an organized crime family.!<",ef4qsw
fcfxqvi,The man blew a fuse. He was forced to sit there and watch Howie soak it up in his own glory and he knew he wouldn’t taste an ounce of that success. By nature people get jealous of other people’s fortune and success and they resent them for it - I know from personal experience. Killing Howie right there was the ultimate self satisfaction for a self loathing bottom feeder who then proceeds to rob his store,ef4qsw

fc4h1vz,"Arno wasn't the Big Boss. He was a middleman bookie who was taking Howard's bets and responsible for collecting the money. If he didn't get the money, he was fucked too. Both Arno and the goons were working for some bigger boss/organization.",ef4qsw
fc8lcah,"I feel like the goons acted in principle. They don't care about who they're working for. They've been actively jerked around and they're fed up. If Howard didn't die, this was never, ever going to stop. Howard would've texted the girl in Vegas to fuck off to a different locale with the money and he would've kept stringing this along. Howard had to die and for the goons, it was the principle of the thing.",ef4qsw

fc1dlnc,I think they had just had enough of Howard fucking with them. Being trapped in the vestibule was enough to set that psycho off.,ef4qsw
fcm7obe,"I like that it doesn't fully answer this stuff.  It's rare to have a film leave some things up to your imagination without it just seeming like unbelievable movie magic.

My take on it was that Arno is a kind of loan shark, Jewish mafia type dude.  He wasn't just a family member loaning him some money who hired some goons to get it back.  I think it's that Arno is a bit of a mobster and has let Howie's indiscretions slide too long.  He says something about ""How's it look, you making bets with my money?""  So he's got a reputation in the underworld, or at least the gambling/loan shark world.  But Howie's family, so he goes easier than usual on them, which his guys see as a weakness.  But ultimately at the end it's just that these goons (or at least the one in particular) is fed up with Howie's bullshit and he isn't family so what's he care.  It's his job, and Howie (and to some extent Arno) has made it a particularly frustrating one lately.

As for killing Arno, I think that was just an ""in for a penny, in for a pound"" type of situation.  He tried to tell Arno to keep cool, but he didn't so there was only one option.  Maybe they've killed people for Arno before (but probably not, they probably just rough people up.  The dead can't pay after all), but this murder was personal and clearly against Arno's wishes.  So when it was clear Arno wasn't going to let it slide, they took him out and robbed the place.  (I think they get caught by the cops since the wife was worried and called them which probably sent a patrol car to the store.)",ef4qsw
fhr6usv,"Those goons were just that, goons.  Arno just wanted his money.  He wasn’t down with hanging Howard out the window and he was relieved when Howard actually pulled it off at the end.

&#x200B;

I agree. I figured that Howard would finally either be killed by the loan sharks, or he'd take his own life at some point after losing his final bet. So I knew it was coming especially when he looks at the dead fish in the glass near the ending. 

On the other hand with Arno's death, I felt bad because I don't think he liked doing what he did to his brother in law, but $100,000 is a lot of money to not pay back. Plus his father in law didn't like him but liked Howard even though Howard was such a screw up.",ef4qsw

Yeah “this is how I win,” comes off shitty. But he’s not a good person whatsoever.

Howard wanted so hard to hit a score, but he had to trade his life in the process to get it. He died with complete elation on his face and went out feeling completely on top. Plus, one of the last things Dinah said to him was that if it was up to her, she’d never see his face again, which comes true with Howard getting killed. And Julia Fox, who spent the whole film worrying that her lifestyle was going to be ripped away from her, ends the film with all of the winnings since she was the one who technically made the bet. And all of the goons are going to prison since Dinah called the cops, and they have no way of leaving the shop since Howard took about the metal prod from the door.

Put yourself in Sandler's situation in this film. Imagine the amount of stress you would be under. I mean, I've been in situations where I owed money and the fear of losing my property drove me insane with anxiety and stress. I can only imagine how someone in this position would be feeling.

Everyone is always talking over each other and you're constantly screaming at Howard for making all these frustrating decisions. The film also moves from scene to scene pretty quickly, you have to pay attention every second otherwise you'll miss a detail.

But in the end, there was a little relief when Howard is shot. His frenetic world comes to a sudden end and it's like you can finally breath again.

The finale was very important, I think that's when I came to appreciate the journey and maybe grasp at some of the overarching morals. Throughout the whole film you want tell Howard to take a breath and slow down, otherwise he'll kill himself and that's exactly what ends up happening.

Don't rush through life without ever taking a second to think about what you're doing and the consequences of your actions. What do you really hope to achieve? What path are you on and where will it lead? If you move too fast it will be too late for you to realise when you've taken a wrong turn, or like Howard you might not even notice at all.",ef4qsw

The dude was at the peak of his earning powers in 2012 and is still to this day one of the top 5 highest paid NBA players of all time. He was making about 170k PER GAME that season.

He believed in that Opal so much he was willing to let go of his sole championship ring that he literally just acquired the season before...and all of a sudden 20k is too rich for his blood?

He was happy he was out of his debt and was going to spend some quality time with Julia and live a stress free life going forward, but then he got shot in the face by the pissed off loose cannon henchman of Arno. I did like Arno feeling bad his brother in law just got killed and going ""you weren't suppose to kill him, why would you do that? I just wanted him to pay me back"" and then him getting shot in the head by his own henchman. Added depth to his character and showed he wasn't evil and that he did care in a way about his brother in law (even if it was for his sister, niece and nephew's sake), unlike his henchman who made a decision to say fuck it and kill both as well as take all the jewelry in the store.",ef4qsw

And I didn't see the ending (Sandler getting shot) coming *at all*. I was actually getting frustrated with the film by the time the third act came around, felt it dragged and that it wasn't living up to Good Time. But holy shit, that ending really took it to another level. I felt the elation Sandler's character felt and in one instant, BANG.",ef4qsw
fi0pj52,"I really agree about the constant rising action.

If you were to try to look at this as a typical three act structure, it would be hard to find clear dividing lines because all of his issues just seem to bleed into the next.  The only time the film takes a breath at all in during the sequence at his in-laws' house.",ef4qsw
fk5e21d,">Why the fu** did he bet the opal money when the collectors where right in the next room and he had money?!?!

Cause he was an addict and he was too used to the high stakes lifestyle that he lived. He did everything close to the wire. Every single thing. His marriage, his kids, his business, his day to day, his auctions, his loans, his gamble, everything was as close to the eye of the storm as possible. Every single decision he made could have been an absolute disaster possibly ending in death from the very start of the movie.

He got used to playing with fire and juggling danger. Constantly. Even guys breaking his nose and hanging him out of a window didn't change his mind, rather drew him in more. Having a gun pointed to his head through the bulletproof door doesnt even get a blink out of him. He was absolutely self-destructive. You could see it starting to develop with the way he raised his oldest kid too, who was watching and learning.

And here's the kicker....Howard wasn't even broke. He had the Mercedes, big loaded house, 3 kids and a wife who were living in luxury, rich extended family ready to lend him $$$ or just be at his side (the auction), an apartment in NYC, a side chick, a business with cash flow, and more.

It's funny because in the end the doctor tells him he's cancer free and that would be the biggest ""gamble""/worry in any middle aged man's week. Instead, it's barely a blip on the radar for him. He gets himself killed playing russian roulette just hours later.",ef4qsw

foeyqa4,"Does it make you feel anxious or disgusting? Maybe it's just me, but I was more disgusted than anxious. Sandler's character was disgusting, his wife was disgusting, his mistress was disgusting, even his older kid was disgusting. The people he did business with were disgusting (not the customers). Everyone's hair was made to look greasy in every scene, just unwashed, kept but unwashed, I could smell them. I feel that is what the director was going for, it has to have been deliberate. They made every character as unattractive as humanly possible, physically, emotionally, their actions. Honestly most of the movie I just wanted to throw up. I don't know how they could have possibly ended the movie without murdering him.  


I thought that if he would have lost the bet at the end that he just might kill himself, but that would have been out of character so somebody would have had to kill him.",ef4qsw

fc900ey,"The thing is he didnt even need to do that. The movie points out several times Howard has more than 100K on him at any given time with just the cost of the stuff hes wearing. The guy that shot him even said his watch is more than his car. Howard was never in any danger of being able to pay back that money, the thing is he just didnt care and kept falling deeper and deeper into his addiction. At the end he probably only needed to pay like 50k since they took the money from him at the beginning.",ef4qsw

Also a movie doesn’t have to bring out good or positive emotion in the viewer to be good. The fact that it brought about any emotion at all in you is a nod to how good the performances were.

Having said all that I don’t think the movie itself was all that great, as there was no real plot, but Sandler’s performance really made the audience feel something.",ef4qsw

fcm47yh,"SPOILERS FOR ALL OF THIS, obviously. 

i got twisted around so many times by the movie that by the end i was extra twisted. I was 100% sure he was dying of colon cancer in a sorta walter white way, that by the end it wouldnt matter if he lived or died cause he was dead anyway. then it just turns out thats not a problem. 

when we got to the end i thought something was gonna go wrong, and then it just kept not going wrong. Julia doesnt get caught by the guys looking after her, the creepy helicopter guy doesnt drug or attack her, everything seemed fine. And then the buzzer goes off and everything went to shit. I wasnt expecting it at all at that moment. then the helicopter dude has the money and i thought she actually was dead. 

ive never been so twisted up by a movie ending before. 

with the trunk thing, i wasnt sure but it looked like they broke it off or jammed it. didnt he reach up for it but couldnt get it to work. thats what i thought at least. 

i loved the scene with him and his daughter. i loved that she didnt actually hang up the phone and started talking to her friend again the second she walked away",ef4qsw

fg6591g,"Not sure I agree with a lot of these...

>Howard would get cancer. when he got the useless call from the doctor, if he was clear why make it a call?

Doctors make calls to tell patients their results are clear all the time.

>Julia was scheming to steal the opal. That call she was having when she entered Howie's apartment where she told someone ""He just got the stone"" or something like that. That call had no purpose at all.

Its purpose was that she knew Howard getting the stone was a big deal so they were going to celebrate. Rewatch the scene, there's nothing suspect about what she says. You're just made to feel suspicious as a viewer because of the movie's pace.

>The pawn shop would end up selling KG's ring. The guys at the pawn insisted a lot on not giving Howie any second chances or special treatment with the payments. At the end they represented no obstacle at all.

Because he made good on the ring before they could sell it?

>Arno was going to die in the glass box. When they constantly showed Arno sweating, breathing heavily through the mouth and blinking really slowly.

I didn't take it as though he was going to die. It was just hot in there.

>Julia would mess up the bet. The dialogues made it clear that she didn't understand sports betting at all, Howie writes it but she starts to stutter and doubt when she goes to the bookie. Even when the teller helps her by reading the note they kept trying to make us think she messed up something when Howie asks her to read the bet ticket out loud in a very tense scene

Because she very well could have messed it up. That's not misleading, that's natural tension.",ef4qsw
fg8mq39,"All of what you just wrote makes me appreciate the film even more. The point of it is to feel what a gambling addict feels, the constant tension, the close calls. 

The point is also that, for gambling addicts, even when they win they lose. Howard got lucky every single time, and he could have walked away, yet he simply couldn't stop himself.",ef4qsw
fc33qed,"Accident was definitely a distraction, whether intentionally planned or just impromptu.

Clearly the Asian men were the foremen of the mining site and the Ethiopians were the grunt workers, they were trying to make some real cash, rather than their terrible wages, so they snuck in to mine the opal to sell discreetly.",ef4qsw
fc32kng,"I was talking about this with my partner and she had a wonderful take on it. The miners are clearly working in terrible conditions, so much so that bones are broken and work goes on just to mine that specific opal. The opal has this mythical quality to it throughout the film and is said to contain human’s history, but it also contains its own. The greed surrounding this opal created suffering in the mines and as the opal travels through Howard’s world, the greed around it creates suffering in Howard’s life. The pain caused by the opal bookends the movie, tunneling from the opal into Howard’s life in the beginning scene, and tunneling out of Howard’s bullet wound back into the universe/opal in the last. The suffering and greed was never abandoned, but only changed hands.",ef4qsw

All that anxiety knowing he felt he had no control over his own destiny made the ending feel like a relief. Which I thought was beautiful in it self. 

Ps. Why do you think the writers chose not to diagnose Howard with something after his colon checkup? Felt like a missed opportunity knowing he was internally struggling.",ef4qsw

fh97jl7,"Because they knew Arno and Howard were family and they saw the soft spot for him, he was getting the debt collectors to go easy on Howard even while he fucked them over repeatedly, and locking them in the doorway was just the last straw. They didn't just kill Howard for direct revenge (although that is a part of it), they did it because if they don't collect the debt they don't get paid, and there was no reason to believe Howard would just pay them the cash and move on. He could have easily just paid them the 100k from selling the stone and put down 65k on the Celtics to win close to 500k. But he didn't, so why would we believe he'd be satisfied and pay the 100k out of the 1.2M instead of putting it all on Garnett and the Celtics in game 1 of the next series? 

So realizing the debt is more trouble than it's worth, they kill Howard and start looting the store because they see it's the only way to realistically get something out of the debt. I think they hoped Arno would come to his senses (although at this point they probably didn't care much) and see the only way they were getting that 100k was by looting the store. But Arno panicked and obviously would have just turned on them later since they're only hired goons and they just killed his brother in law.",ef4qsw

Furthermore, many of the ways he tried to ""get ahead"" was by pushing people around and screaming at them. Perhaps if there was more backstory on the origins of the opal, and the 17-18 months he spent acquiring it, you might see the human in him.

Inevitably, he pushes the wrong person to their limit, they lose it, and they happen to have a gun.  It has nothing to do with greed, it's a purely impulsive, anger-driven action.  He was probably sitting in there the whole time, stewing, thinking about all the shit this guy's put him through, watching him dance around and yell, his stupid fucking smile, and the whole time he's just fixating on the thought ""as soon as this dumb fucking worthless moron lets me out of here I'm gonna shoot him in the fucking face"".

Good Time was a better watch for me because the editing was QUITE as chaotic, simplpy because it was usually just two characters on screen at any given time.

2. It showed how he wants to be that big shot but only kinda gets his way and there's always a catch and he somewhat humiliates himself and others.

He literally can’t see how great is life could be or is. When his wife turns him down, Julia Fox’s character picks him up.

They know Howard's never going to pay Arno even with the million. He's obviously just going to put that million down on Garnett and the Celtics in game 1 of the next series and could lose it just as easily. If Arno's too soft on Howard to let them collect the debt (which they have every reason to believe he is), the debt collectors won't get paid. So they kill Howard and rob the store to get something out of the whole thing, and hope that snaps Arno to his senses to realize Howard was never going to pay them so all they can do is take the jewelry and move on. 

Instead Arno tries to run away and would obviously have turned on them if he got away, since they're just hired goons and he's clearly shaken up when they kill Howard who they know is family.

Arno wasn’t a mobster. My guess is that he was a business man who called debt collectors on his piece of shit brother in law (Howard).

Arno knew as soon as they were done looting all of Howard’s shit, they’d be taking Arno to Arno’s house/shop/etc to clear him out too, so he tried to escape while they were looting. He tried to escape the consequences of trying to be gangster and failing, so they killed him.

fgsxseh,"Absolutely, there's lots to it. We gaze into the stone and end up in his colon after seeing those gorgeous trippy visuals inside the stone. At the end of the film we gaze into the bullet wound (which looks kinda like a ruby too) and see the same shapes and colours inside. Despite it being an uncut gem, there's something magnetic about the stone and how it draws people in, and the same thing exists in Howard. Think about how crazy it is for Garnett to leave his only championship ring behind for the stone, or be in New York on the morning of a game 7 in Boston just to buy some stone. Or how crazy it is for someone like Julia to be genuinely in love with Howard. Howard's son looks up to him, etc. even though he's a total sleazeball and degenerate gambler. We're drawn to him as the audience too, we recognize he's a greaseball and an idiot but we're right there with him absolutely elated when his big bet finally pays off. 

When the oncologist calls Howard and says he's clear, they riff a bit and Howard says something like ""colon cancer took a lot of my family"", and the doctor chuckles and replies that it also bought him a house in the Hamptons. Then when talking with Garnett about the price he paid for the stone they touch on something similar with him paying 100k for a stone he planned to sell for 1M and how Howard and other jewellers profit off dangerous mining in poor parts of the world. To me this is what's implied by the ""universe"" element to that (the ending shot of the stars etc), at the beginning the miner is in grave danger from an accident while at the end of the film Howard's in grave danger over the outcome of a basketball game while surrounded by hundreds of gems people died to mine. Absurd, right?

The same magnetic quality in the stone is in Howard, the same morally conflicted greed that makes an oncologist a multi-millionaire makes Howard (briefly) a millionaire, etc. Howard gets a clean bill of health from the oncologist which would normally be the kind of massive relief a film would be structured around, but Howard has something much worse inside him already.",ef4qsw

Critics want to see something original with realistic characters and/or grounded performances driven by complex emotions played by actors doing those roles seamlessly. They want to see directors with solid world building skills that have every detail fleshed out and look alive to the according genre. Once these standards are met, any number of things can push it up higher for a critic. For example, this movie is ""anxiety inducing,"" so that makes them think highly of the editing and the music, mixed with the high octane performances.

Audiences just want to be entertained. They're not stroking their chins looking for these elements or examining their originality. These things usually don't even need to be invisible in technique. They want a unique world with familiar characters and a story that has them hooked (stakes need to be high) with a satisfying ending. It's an unwritten rule that every movie must have some sort of romance as well.

fikz3kh,"As someone who just stopped the movie halfway, I don't understand how the film has such high critic scores. The sound design is a mess, I guess to heighten the tension. All it did was make dialogue hard to understand.

Guys a scummy scammer with a gambling problem, a family that's tired of him, and a hot stripper girlfriend; why do I care about him? In the end, I didn't.

First, the director went out of his was to omit details of Howard's story. He was trying to create this sense of ambiguity around Howard, maybe make him more mysterious. But it fell flat, and made it very difficult to get invested in the characters. The viewer slowly realizes that Howard is not the person you should root for, and that he's actually a sick piece of shit. 

For some reason, the director has it in his head, that people are identifying with Howard, or that people like him. So they put him in a very low/vulnerable state. I thoroughly gave zero fucks about him crying, and was hoping that Julia would turn on him, take his money and run.

So his final hail marry was trying to create a sense of suspense, and to make the viewer be hopeful for Howard. But I seriously can't imagine anyone actually rooting for this guy. During that entire scene, I felt like the guys trapped in the glass. I wasn't enjoying it, just waiting for him to die (which it was obvious they would kill him).

If he wasn't killed here he would have gambled away the money, still owed scary people money, and been killed for it next week or next month, his entire life was leading to this point, making bad choices, gambling with other people's money, it was getting bigger and bigger and bigger and was going to explode eventually no matter what.

I didn't see Arno getting shot - at first - but the moment that thug-face put his gun to his head, I knew he was biting it too.

Otherwise, I predicted NOTHING ELSE in this movie accurately. Every near miss that de-escalated all lead to feeding the feeling of dread that quickly is resolved by a quick ""pow!"" to the noggin.

And I also thought of Adam Sandler's other movie riddled with anxiety, Punch Drunk Love. That movie's soundtrack is so tense, and the pace much like uncut gem, To make the viewer understand the anxiety the characters going through.

I understand if you don't enjoy anxiety from watching a movie. I suffer from anxiety myself.

First of all, there's not that much valuable stuff in the store.

Second, they show his ex-wife calling the cops. The only story reason to show you that is to say ""don't worry, the bad guys didn't get away with it"".

Adding to that, you see the bar that let the door open fall after they shot Howard. There's a reason why the door malfunctioned and there's a reason why they showed you several people trying to open the door until only Howard knew how to do so. They were locked in there.

It's spelled out: they got locked in and the cops caught them. Life in prison for two executions. Maybe his partner gets away with less with a good lawyer.

And there's some other stuff: the girlfriend got away and she could identify them. The building they were in had similar businesses that surely had the same cameras that Howard had (if they managed to find the recordings at all).

Howard booked a helicopter ride to the casino for her. I don't even think the old guy was flying the helicopter but rather that he was a passenger on the same heli.

The auction was on the same day he had to repay his debt to Arno (Monday) so the money might not have been in his account in time. That said I don't think this was really about money. Howard has a big house, an apartment in the city and drives a mercedes. He could have probably come up with a legit way to just pay off his debts but he constantly wanted to make deals and gamble.

He knew that if the opal had power for him as a totom, he would do well at the game the next day. Once it worked (his sales tactic), he changed his bet, hoping (with good reason) that him taking it home would turn the tide of the game in a way that no one else could predict. 

And every choice he made led him to his fate in the final scene. I don't think that was their *plan* at all. They just finally had enough of his bullshit.",ef4qsw
ffkgz9t,"letting KG take the opal makes a lot of sense honestly. a) KG doesn't need the money and won't steal it.  KG was known for having a huge contract back then, and in 2012 he'd made about 300 mil from NBA contracts alone, not even taking into account his endorsement money or anything else he's made money off of.  b) having KG as a client, and keeping that client happy, will only lead to him bringing more super rich clients.  and it would possibly lead to more NBA clients, and he loves basketball.  

the mistress needed to be gorgeous because that keeps you in suspense as to whether she's going to leave him at any moment or not, especially towards the end with her winnings.",ef4qsw
fgkefsj,"> Why?

Addictive personality, possibly bipolar.

Edit. Don't confuse the great reviews that film is 'enjoyable' like you're having a good time watching it. Its an uncomfortable film and Howard is not a likeable character. You aren't supposed to like him, merely feel empathy for him. He's a liar, a thief and a cheat. He's a shitty father and husband. He has no friends that we see other than his girlfriend. You are drawn to the conclusion in the hopes that he will turn his life around. Even if he hadn't ended up the way he did you can be certain money would not have fixed his problems, at least the long-term ones. The ones that actually matter",ef4qsw
fgp1k9i,"Except it wasn't going to fix anything. He might have temporarily been able to pay people back, but he'd bet the remaining all away soon enough and re-enter the cycle of addiction leaning on family members as he had been doing for god knows how long. Howard was completely out of touch with reality (as seen when asking his wife if she'd consider not going through with the implied divorce). Maybe some of the subtext wasn't evident enough. But I thought it was less of a drama and mirrored Joker as a look in to the dysfunction of mental illness (a different kind though obviously). 

So yes, Howard was a gambling addict, accumulating debts to several people (we see Arno, Gooey and those two older dudes he gave a fake Rolex to as well, and the pawn shop workers, probably owes more off screen too). It wasn't about being rich so much as he couldn't control his addiction, he was seeking the rush, which he explains to Kevin (I'm not an athlete/winning monologue). His double life was part of the addiction/fantasy. It just so happens that addiction/fantasy revolves around money/the high life.",ef4qsw

He had money and all his debts paid off with 65k extra in his pockets and he AGAIN chooses to gamble everything away. Not just any gamble but some insanely low chance tripple bet.

Like every decision he made was retarded I didn't even feel bad for him during his break down because he deserved it he choose to make all those dumbass decisions.hell if he didn't send a picture of the money to Arno before he placed the bet it wouldn't have been pulled. Like have some common sense they said they were after you and you are walking around like you don't have a big target on your back.

I'm not sure that we're meant to feel sorry for Harold. The closing shot of the film (imagery of gems inside his head) reinforced Harold's fixation with greed. He had a fatal flaw which undid him, and while we might have rooted for him as the protagonist I don't think he was meant to be someone we identified or sympathised with.",ef4qsw

fdmidgt,"I agree with your overall conclusion, but not sure how “predicting” his death soured it for you. This wasn’t an M. Night Shayamalan film. I think everyone in the theater knew it would end in tragedy, which is really the source of the anxiety. It’s like watching someone drown for 2 hours. 

I thought it was nice to see a tragedy of greed film where the first half isn’t all sunshine and rainbows, as opposed to a film like Blow. It definitely tapers the tragedy aspect but the inevitable doom  is established from the very beginning, which amps up the suspense a bit more. Wouldn’t say I prefer this route but it was refreshing to see.  

Overall, I’d give it a 7/10, where a 5/10 is an average film.",ef4qsw

Even the end doesnt pay off. He doesnt get what is coming to him from any of the risks he took, he frustrates the guy shaking him down into just killing him and running off instead. The house of cards never fell down.

fcu5i8d,"There was no mention of the goons getting more money just because Howard won. It was insinuated that he would finally pay them but nothing about more money. Plus they (Phil and his partner) were still only getting paid for the job of being the muscle for Arno, not a lot of money. The whole movie Phil felt like the wild card. From the moment he slapped Howard because he brought him a glass of water you could tell he wasn't playing by the rules of the diamond district. Everyone else from demony to the pawn guys seemed to know Howard and the game but Phil was always pissed off by it. The prospect of robbing the jewelry shop after killing Howard and Arno was enough financial motivation to make the killing worth it to Phil. ""those were the actions of a homicidal maniac not someone angry for being locked up"" yes what kind of people do you think loansharks hire to be their heavies?

Also Howard winning over a million was part of what contributes to Phil's anger towards him not the opposite. The idea of this guy who had dicked him around for so long was going to be a millionaire because he used the money Phil was hired to collect to place a bet while Phil was fucking locked in a cage pushed Phil's already violent mind too far. It's not like Phil just snapped while he was in the cage, he told Howard the entire movie he was going to bury him starting when kgs muscle removed them from the jewelry store the first time kg went there. Phil was a ticking time bomb from the beginning and Arno didn't know who he had hired until it was too late.",ef4qsw

fg8j01q,funny my wife made tons of comments about how loud it was and I loved the dialogue the acting and the score but I was so engrossed I never particularly noticed the loudness one way or the other..netflix viewer here no sound system for reference,ef4qsw
fc1z1wh,"> And if you disagree, or think I'm wrong, tell me where I'm wrong; I'd be happy to hear you out.

I would disagree on this point:

> No, it was not ""anxiety producing."" It was loud, obnoxious, irritating, annoying, aggravating, headache inducing and NOT in a good way. Not because the situation or the characters naturally created the situation; 

I would say him being in massive debt to shady people and making horrible decisions like pawning KG's ring were created by the situations/character decisions and not by the camera work/acting/sound.

Him deciding to bet all the money after KG pays him back is another good example.

So while I see where you are coming from about the sensory overload, I also think you are underselling the story a bit.",ef4qsw
fc1zf02,"This guy is 100% correct. Felt like watching the movie Hustlers again. A lot of filler for this disappointingly thin plot, with a guest appearance by some hip-hop/R&B icon to presumably compensate for the enormous pile of bullshit we were drug through (The Weekend was to this garbage as Lizzo was to Hustlers). Also, similarly to Hustlers, it was advertised to be a great, suspenseful, dramatic movie and in the end leaves you asking yourself, “What the hell did I just watch?” 
Sorry, not even worth the Redbox fee.",ef4qsw
fc2agrp,Best description yet.  Obnoxious throughout.  Sound track sucked balls.,ef4qsw
fc1ync2,"I mean I don’t know how you expected a bunch of loan sharks and degenerate gamblers from the north east to act? There was generally a lot on the line in every scene, plus that’s just the way some people from that area of the country tend to speak in any situation. The loud and obnoxious dialogue fit the setting and overall conflict of the story pretty well if you ask me. Would’ve seemed pretty out of place for a bunch of gamblers in a conflict over hundreds of thousands of dollars to be speaking in a calm, level-headed manner don’t ya think?",ef4qsw
fc7izbr,"This comment just made me breathe a sigh of relief. I just saw this movie and it is bothering me so much that people like it so much. All of these comments saying it was well acted, well directed? I just don’t understand. There was nothing spectacular about the writing besides the occasional one-liner—which were mostly unintelligible due to the chaotic sound mix, the constant close ups got old really fast especially when everyone was shouting, and the attempts to do other types shots were so out of place and felt so unmotivated that they seemed like they had been shot by a first-time college student cinematographer. 


But my favorite thing you said is this “anxiety” bs. Having people shout in your movie is not creating an organic, emotional sense of anxiety, it’s creating a physical one. It’s making your basic human instincts tense up because they are being assaulted by harsh, annoying, grating sounds. Its like a jump scare in a horror movie. It’s like a comedian tickling you and then insisting they’re funny because you laughed. It’s not as legitimate or significant because it’s just a physical reaction. 


Finally, and I will say I’m biased because I am a woman, I’m so tired of seeing movies where these horrifying looking men having gorgeous women going after them. We certainly know it’s not his personality that’s attracting them, and based on how devoted Julia Fox’s character was, it apparently wasn’t money either. 


Like you said, I don’t disparage anyone for liking this or having an opinion, but it’s just really confusing for me to see so much technical positivity about this horrible movie.",ef4qsw
fc1ze1b,Thank you! I was trying to find a way to summarize my thoughts about the movie. Was tempted to walk out halfway through. Just wasn’t interesting and seemed like it didn’t go beyond the surface level the whole time.,ef4qsw
fc4spen,Fucking nailed it. What a fucking miserable movie to watch. If this movie made you anxious then i dont know what the fuck to tell you. It was just flat out annoying,ef4qsw
fc1yif1,You just have been in the car ride home with my wife and I after this one. Our thoughts exactly. I liked the 2012 feel of the movie. That's about our only positive.,ef4qsw
fc45btm,"Mostly agreed.  My friend and I didn't particularly care for it.  I can respect a lot of the performances in it, and I *wanted* to like it, but it just really didn't do it for me.

People here are getting way too upset that you have a different opinion than them... about a movie.",ef4qsw
fc231e8,"I really don’t understand all the praise the movie is getting. It was objectively terrible, too long, predictable, constantly yelling and trying way too hard to keep tension and no release. The whole concept was dumb. 

Just a frustrating, annoying, loud the whole time yet still boring film. 

How in the world did so many people in the comment section not see the ending coming. Dumb.",ef4qsw
fctp0oh,"Idk what you’re talking about man. Pretty much everything you mentioned seems like perfectly sane narrative choices for a movie that drops you right into the middle of the plot.  Considering the Safdis themselves are Jews whose dad was a runner in NYC’s diamond district - all these things all seem more plausible that not.

The use of Lopatin’s (another NYC Jew and also musical genius) synth-heavy score was a great stylistic choice and I’m also not understanding why you’re hating it. Just because something is “electronic” doesn’t by default mean it can only be used in sci-fi. You bringing Star Wars into this kind of paints you as the wrong demographic for this movie. 

It seems like you went into this with your own preconceptions on what makes a good movie, while those notions just don’t apply to this movie. It’s more kinetic and visceral than anything I’ve seen in years.",ef4qsw

fkcgngc,"You should watch Cocoon then. People talk slowly, quietly and only after the other character finished talking.",ef4qsw
fc258ly,"Been thinking about the movie all afternoon since seeing it today and I mostly agree with everything you’ve said. 

Also to your point about Julia, I just saw an interview where she said after reading the part she was shocked because it was like the Safdie bros wrote this role for her. So yeah, the character is like her. 

This could have been an interesting movie but it really was just pure chaos caused by poor writing, and not controlled chaos on the writers behalf.",ef4qsw
fc2c2cb,Did you not get a xmas present or something?,ef4qsw
fhm7s7x,"I understand what you're saying, but I think that adds more to the dynamic of the movie.  Most viewers are used to standard scenes of dialogue: a few people back and forth, no interrupting, one line after the other.  But this movie takes all of those conventions and throws them out.  EVERYBODY at one time, at the same time, one on top of another.  It helps add to the chaotic/anxious tone throughout.  

But I totally see it not being for some people",ef4qsw
fha5w7i,That’s what added to the realism of the chaos,ef4qsw
fc1tsdc,"Fwiw, I found it very believable that he was a functional semi-normal business owner / gambler for a long time and then clearly degenerated over the previous year or so. He went down the tube. That definitely happens.",ef4qsw
fc4m303,"Him crying in that office is supposed to appear to be bad acting actually. He’s not actually that upset, he’s trying to manipulate Julia into feeling sympathy for him. The way he snaps out of it when he gets a the phone call soon after is a clue.",ef4qsw
fc69u1e,the scene where he’s trying to talk his wife into staying with him and she starts laughing at his stupid face coupled with the other scene where the wife says she basically doesn’t want to wait any longer to officially split up makes it seem like howard’s manipulates her into all this up to now and she’s had enough,ef4qsw
fea8i1z,"oh thank god other sane people on this thread. I thought i was going crazy when i hated this movie despite all the praise.

Sandler was good, but the movie was not. It was all over the place, rushed, and very VERY hard to follow.",ef4qsw

ffwkqx9,"One of the worst movies I've ever sat through, I cant believe it got great reviews",ef4qsw
fbzp79k,Why are characters always supposed to be sympathetic? Sometimes it's just about exploring these people and you're not really supposed to like them.,ef4qsw
fbzq656,"I find it really interesting you say that, because I was the other way round in that I found Howard more sympathetic than Connie, even though as you say Connie does have more of a 'good' intention. Both are definitely destructive characters though, and I think that's why I found them both so compelling.

Nevertheless it's really interesting to read such a response. I imagine some interesting essays could be crafted out of comparing the two films and their character dynamics.",ef4qsw
fc0v8q5,"You're right, but the movie isn't really about sympathizing with a character as much as it is a character study. I also really disliked Howard and found him to have zero redeemable qualities. He's just an absolute sleazeball the entire movie. This is more of a movie that's meant to put you into a certain state of mind, that being anxious, rather then getting immersed into the characters themselves. 

There's nothing really deep to extract here as far as character motivations go. But that's fine, it was still a decent watch. I'm not sure about all this best picture and best actor buzz I'm seeing in this thread though.",ef4qsw
fc2bmis,"I completely get the not being able to sympathize with anyone part. I did like this movie, because I can de with that in short bursts (2 hours) but I absolutely hated the Sporanos for the same reason.",ef4qsw

fc0lknq,I don't think it was confusing but the writing was wonky. I don't even know why you would compare it to the Depated outside of main characters getting murdered quickly in the end.,ef4qsw
fc1q3n3,"The movie has a constant stream of people yelling at the main character, its part of the charm for a lot of people myself including. If she can handle that, it should be okay. And the second to last scene might scare the fuck out of her. It def made me jump. I don't think you want to be spoiled of it, even if you've already said you do. Its a very major spoiler.",ef4qsw
fc1hdu8,plenty of glass breaking and gun shots,ef4qsw
fc1j4p2,"It doesn't have any jumpscares or really horrific moments, its not that kind of movie. However you can call it very anxiety inducing. If she doesn't mind watching a pretty stressful but exciting movie then she'll be fine. Was worth it for me for sure",ef4qsw

fc8ztud,"Absolutely yes IMO. I somehow misread the movie length prior to seeing it and thought it was gonna be only an hour and a half (lol), but considering it was 2 hr 30 mins I didn’t find myself wanting it to be over or felt like any parts dragged. The film had a wonderful way of keeping you hooked without feeling overwhelming or like there were multiple useless tidbits just randomly thrown in there.",ef4qsw
fca407u,why did you click on a spoiler thread then,ef4qsw
fc8u7qs,"I think so. The climax sequence (not just the ultimate end) made me like it more, but I was gathering steam on it all the way to the end.",ef4qsw

fcjvdw0,"That was at least a million dollar payout

fckyibw,"I will add that often you aren't allowed to tie that many props together in a parlay when they are so closely tied together because being that correlated if one hits they are higher probably to all hit. Like Garnett everything.

This is an exaggerated example but a similar general idea as no way would you be allowed to parlay the exact same moneyline together multiple times like celts +3 parlayed with the same game celts +3. You are just increasing upside with the same exact risk which is a no go.

I dont remember if that exact 6 play parlay violated (like possible Garnett double double x garnett rebounds)

fdhkwjw,"that would have cheapened the whole movie in my opinion. not every thriller needs some big twist at the end

I felt like it was a little tough to make out exactly what Howard was doing when everyone was screaming the whole time. But again, that could’ve just been my mood, and it also could’ve been my lack of knowledge of gambling lexicon. I wasn’t sure I understood everything they were talking about. So in hindsight, I think I did like this movie. It was a fascinating look into how a person kept making terrible choices and doing terrible things and how that ultimately did him in. I’ll probably want to watch it again so that I can pick back up on the things I wasn’t sure I understood. I almost always do better when I analyze movies rather than watch them one time.",ef4qsw

fcjyl52,The ending was realistic imo. Brother-in-law wasn’t the crime boss he thought he was and didn’t know how to keep a chain on his contracted muscle.

They knew that, if he did pull it off, he would expect them to celebrate and respect his skill. What Howie didn't understand was that he'd already did enough wrongdoing to those guys (biting and locking them in a door for 3+ hours).

Because of that, all redeemable respect he could have gotten back was lost. 

Sure, the brother in law gained the respect, but basically goons will be goons. If they could've captured the girl, they would be happy. 

But, a room full of jewelry, offing their witness (Howard and fam) was a nice consolation prize.

I just watched this and I just couldn't get past the ending. Howard was so consumed by gaining respect that he didn't think once to simply call the cops and send those goons away. He also didn't think to just open the other side of the door so they can go.

Despite Howard being a fairly loathsome character with a tragic story arc in which he can't stop giving in to his various lusts, I connected with him because he didn't seem like a horrible guy in his heart; just a slave to his demons. and this lends itself to the nerve-wracking bit: imagine if this were your every-day life because you couldn't stop yourself from making increasingly poor decisions. He's trying to fill an un-fillable hole in his life and pushing those around him into equally risky/dangerous/life-ruining behavior.

Now.. lets say that the hitman didnt end Howard right then and there, none of that money would go to the hitmen except for what Arno was paying them. Also, u think Howard, having the shitfuck attitude, would have gave Arno half the winnings? Nope. He would try to argue that hell pay off his debt and the rest is his.

If you're asking why he specifically was cast, you'd be hard-pressed to find an artist with a bigger underground following on the brink of stardom back in 2012. Considering the premise of the climax involved a *real* basketball player playing himself during a *real* NBA playoff game, I feel it's important to cast a real musician, as a fictional one would have broken the realism.

  Like if Julia was a real character, I'm sure that she would look back at her relationship with Howard 10 years later and shake her head at her past self, saying, ""What was I ever thinking being with him?""  Because it's so clear to literally every single other person in Howard's life that he's the biggest fuckup known to man, but Julia is one of the only people who sticks by his side.",ef4qsw

I can’t see a way them wrapping that movie up with any relevant message without him dying — that’s kind of the point, that after so many opportunities to break even and walk away, he kept pushing. He had to die. 

That said, I think Julia was still gonna head back to him. There would’ve been more allusion to suspicion if she weren’t.

But now that I say that, I think maybe that’d be a more effective way to have ended the movie. After Good Time, I was expecting it to culminate in death so Howie’s wasn’t a huge surprise to me. Being fucked over by someone he didn’t give a shit about who he was simply using like everyone else in his life would’ve been good.

 The movie is loud, and stressful but to me that's the beauty of it. One of the main themes is gambling addiction. This movie makes me anxious but gambling is extremely anxious. The point of the movie is to bring you into this characters life and make you feel his emotions. His life is anxious and chaotic. Therefore the movie is. If the movie made you feel uncomfortable that was the point, they wanted to make you uncomfortable. The dialogue on top of the dialogue wasn't a production error, it was done on purpose a creative choice. That's how the sound would be on the diamond district, it's very authentic.

 If you don't enjoy that experience I completely understand. It's just some us enjoy any experience if it's well done because that's the point of filmaking, to bring you into a world you don't understand. So if you don't understand why some people love this film that's why, we enjoy the experience.

I don't like Howard at all, he's a selfish asshole. But his life is entertaining",ef4qsw

fkmqgvy,"My take on the film and the ""Hired Muscle"" is this. I believe Arno hired the muscle just to scare Howard into paying him. You could clearly tell Arno was weak and didn't really like violence he turned away at every sign of it. Each time Howard tried to talk himself out of it Arno had to turn his head and walk away, which shows that he was sympathetic towards Howard. In the film when the muscle was first sent to collect the owed money Howard called Arno and stated basically ""why are you sending collectors to get your money?"" Which imo shows that Arno just recently hired these guys hoping  to finally get paid. So I believe the ""Hired Muscle's"" Job was simple... Scare Howard get my money get your cut and job done. They pushed and pushed to get the money plus their cut to the point of frustration that created pure hatred in their eyes for Howard. This Unfortunately in return also ruined their respect for Arno realizing that he was weak, sympathetic, and was never going to take the next step on actually making Howard pay up. When Arno realized Howard won you could hear in his voice the sound of him being happy for Howard with a tone of relief that it was finally over, But the muscle had enough of the bullshit took matters into their own hands and decided to get their cut right then. Their hatred spiked, they killed Howard out of pure hatred, killed Arno out of disgust for being so weak which also tied up a loose end, took the jewelry for their over due payday which also made it look like a robbery and called it case closed.

fsvcy5v,"I remember one of my college english professors would give this recurring talk on story telling. He would emphasize that the greatest books of all time had tragically flawed protagonists and tragic storylines (aka no happily ever after). I think this applies to movies as well. While a perfect ending can be satisfying on occasion when it fits the narrative theme of a story, most convincing pieces of story telling involve the downfall and or tragedy of the protagonist that you learn a lesson from. 

The Hollywood formula for films has gotten painfully repetitive, I don’t know of any Adam Sandler movies without a happy ending, so this came to me as a breath of fresh air. His death serves a function in the overall narrative of the movie. If he made it off with the money in the end you wouldn’t have such a visceral reaction to KG’s borrowed speech on the tv post win, Arno wouldn’t have faced the consequence of escalating his treatment of family. 

If he wasn’t shot in the face he would have never faced the consequence of the laundry list of betrayals throughout the movie, in a karmic way him being shot in the face was him facing the music. This ending leaves us thinking whether or not he deserved to be shot, considering all the “dues” he’s put in and the work he’s put in finessing all of these people finally paid off just like he said / planned. Everyone he finessed ended up a richer person with the big win in the end, which seems to be the nature of his jeweling business.

Stories where the main character finally overcomes their struggles by the end are so common.

In this story, I couldn’t tell if Howard would ever overcome his external struggles, but the writers, directors, and Sandler did such a great job convincing me that Howard would never overcome his internal struggles, it made me actually start rooting against the main character’s efforts to succeed against his external ones. 

I can’t remember many movies that have done that. 

Then, in a twist, when he actually succeeds in resolving his external struggles, and I quickly came around to feeling happy for the guy. And then of course it flips in an instant for him and I felt sad. And two minutes prior I was rooting against him! 

Incredible roller coaster of emotion there that I’d never get from a movie before, and again, the cast and crew did a great job.

fd5ak4r,"Seems like you're making a moral judgement about the mistress instead of about the film. I hear what you're saying, but I think the ending is meant to feel ""triumphant"" for Howie while actually being horrifying for the audience. He's won the bet, but we all know that all this will accomplish is enabling his terrible habits and his gambling addiction. Odds are, he's not going to use the money to pay his father back or to send his kids to college. At best, he'll pay off the bookies and gangsters he owes money to, get berated into paying some bills by his wife, and then gamble the rest either on sports of another dangerous conflict gem investment.

With regards to the mistress, I think you're being way too hard on her. She did not plan this heist whatsoever. In fact, she's proven to be one of the relatively responsible people around Howie (emphasis on ""relatively""). He expected her to flip out and trash the apartment when he dumps her -- essentially for cheating on him even though he also has a wife and kids. She acted calmly, did not trash the apartment, faithfully came back to work, and followed his instructions when given the money. She doesn't know that Howie has gotten himself killed and probably doesn't know the full extent of his bullshitting or his dangerous debts. In fact, she may be in serious trouble when she gets back to the city because of the people looking to collect on Howie's debts.

If anyone is the bad guy here for endangering grandpa, the family, and the kids, it's Howie. He's been ripping off friends, family, and business partners and evening stealing watches from the dude who helped him get the KG connection and the huge sale. Whenever he gets the chance to pay off a debt, he gambles it instead. Certainly, the mistress doesn't literally deserve the millions, but Howie has effectively nuked his own business and her job, endangered her life, and traumatized her, along with his family. If he was at all responsible, he'd have some sort of life insurance policy to protect his family in case he gets murdered, and both the family and the mistress would be financially OK and able to move on with their lives. But let's be real, Howie was not a risk averse person and probably didn't plan ahead. The true gift to the family and friends is, sadly, having this time-bomb of a person out of their lives.",ef4qsw
fd52eca,"I disagree that the ending was a dud, I thought it was amazing. With that said, I wised that the mistress was killed as well and the ""bad guys"" at the casino got the money instead.

2. This is a gambling addict. He wasn't thinking rationally, he was just thinking ""I have a shit ton of money and these guys got their money now so they must be happy."" Wasn't even thinking about how pissed the goons must be.
3. Because these are pissed off goons. Plus they the office door was open so they could go in there to get rid of the footage. Not that it mattered since they wouldn't be able to leave anyway. Remember how the metal file fell, and how unreliable the magnetic door was?

This sort of CinemaSins brand of thinking is killing legitimate film criticism and discussion.",ef4qsw
fddy0qj,Can't speak to the other questions but my understanding of the first question is that the Arno's guys tailed him to the restaurant where he made the bet with his bookie and that they stopped it (i.e. told his bookie not to place it/took the money) before it could be officially placed.,ef4qsw
fe0boy1,"Arno called the bookie and cancelled the bet since it was with his money. Mind you, I’ve never heard of a bookie who would do this, but maybe his goons had something to do with it.

He had to die. After everything that happened, the win wasn't going to stop him at all. He probably wouldn't even settle his debts. Just go out and spend the $1mil he just won on something else. He wouldn't change. We saw what he did when his $40k parlay hit, he partied and fucked his side chick. He burned so many bridges in the week, all focused on selling that opal, and using it to ""solve his problems"", that it led to his death.

fciwi1l,"I think what was most compelling for me is that I know people like this exist - I recognize the Howard character, the Julia character, the Weekend character as real types of people I haven’t really met but know of. I know they exist, maybe interact with them a tiny bit. And either haven’t thought to imagine what their lives look like in first person, or tried to and thought “god how does a person get like that? and keep being and being and being every day of their lives and not see anything wrong ? like I literally don’t understand.” 

And then this movie sort of answers that question? Like I don’t sympathize with Howard. At all! He’s legitimately so gross in every way? But by the end of the movie, I do sort of begrudgingly get it. I get how all of this grossness can be a real person’s honest decisions. Like how a real person at each of these terrible choices could actually believe they are the best ones. Not because he’s like a victim or in some way misled. Like he’s just as gross all the way through as on first blush. But he has an internal logic to the grossness that can make sense?",ef4qsw

fc0d32c,"To me, the movie was about Adam Sandler’s character and not gambling or the bets. That’s why I think the movie kept the storylines separated. Despite the storylines being separated each individual thread showed another component of just how much of a scumbag Sandler was.

Sandler’s performance lived up to the hype for me but I think a lot of that had to do with me not reading the hype till after I saw the movie. If before I saw it I had read everything that I read after I think I would be in a similar situation as you where I felt that he didn’t live up to it. Kind of like reading a review for watching a movie kind of hurts your opinion of the movie sometimes.

The scenes were repetitive but there were different elements in it and the anxiety increased across each scene. It was like the Safdie brothers were making a stew and yea the ingredients of the stew did not change but as the stew matured overtime the stew continued to get better and better. Idk if that analogy makes sense but as I am writing this it’s the way I’m going with describing it.

The ending made my jaw drop. I honestly thought Howard was making it out alive. You’re right in that’s not how most gambling movies end but the ending still got me maybe because of how much I was rooting for Howard to make it out.

Sandler's crying scene was awful, the constant noise and yelling was more annoying than stressful, and the entire family/Julia breakup portion of the movie was unnecessary.

So when he wins at the end, he’s 100% going to fuck things up for himself, more than likely sooner than later, though the audience is still falling for his act. The guy that kills Howard just happens to be a little smarter than us, and knows that Howard winning isn’t really winning, there is no winning with Howard.

If you're familiar with that story, there's a moment after Daisy hits Myrtle Wilson with Gatsby's car where Nick basically goes to him and in so many words says, ""Dude, it's over. You need to get out of town."" If Gatsby had listened right then and there, he would've survived. He was incapable of accepting reality though and got killed for it.

Howard had a chance to get away. Against all odds, he sold the opal, got the cash from KG, made amends with his mistress, and she even got his name tatted on her ass to show her loyalty. That's his Gatsby moment. He could've walked away right then and been fine, but his tragic flaw is that he's an action junkie, so he makes the G7 bet and seals his demise.

I honestly never thought a happy ending was coming. He had his chance at a happy ending at the end of the 2nd act, and if it wasn't going to happen then, then it wasn't going to happen.",ef4qsw

Nope, it wasn't.  It looked newly recorded and ""It was just me and the rock"" isn't something KG would say either, that's disrespectful to the team concept.

fbzdvi5,Obviously Arno should’ve been more careful with who he hired as his “muscle”. But why go to that lengths to come after your own brother in law like that even? You know eventually Howard would pay him back,ef4qsw
fbzefs7,Interesting perspective. I took it as Arno was the loan shark. In the beginning when Howard leaves a voicemail for him he says something along the lines of “I can’t believe you’d send these goons to my business.” Then later at the family dinner he says to Arno - “not so tough without your muscle around”,ef4qsw

fcj6nn7,I don't think that is the case though. I felt like Howard seemed so unbothered about paying the debt back because it was with his brother in law and not goons. He never expected his actions could end in his death or even physical harm to himself because he borrowed money from someone he knew.,ef4qsw
fc0s8ne,"Arno could have even just said to the goons “hey, my brother in law owes me 100k, I’ll give you a percentage back if you help me beat him up.” I think Arno is also a bookie, so it could be that too",ef4qsw

What's fascinating about his films is how easy he's able to flip the switch from calm to nerve-wracking. I think Ari Aster is also good at making movies feel like waking nightmares, but again they don't have that same kind of frenzied energy. And then there's directors like Damien Chazelle, who can do frantic anxiety in Whiplash but also a much more restrained energy in something like First Man. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I can't really think of a director who's consistently making frantic, anxiety laden movies.

Ultimately as a family member, there’s not really much you can do apart from let them hit rock bottom, stop fixing all their problems, stop bailing them out.. 

What also rung true for me was the scene when the fish died - he’s lost everyone, he feels hopeless, he’s so on the brink of maybe realising he has nothing and needs help, and in walks the enabler who forgives him for everything he’s done, and bam - the addict has lost any need to give up. He’s got everything back he was worried of losing - and more. 

There were so many points in the film where if his family members had just gone - nope, no more, it’s over, you need help... but instead they bail him out and it just gets worse and worse.

On one hand, I can see it as a purposeful red herring (is that the right tearm; basically, you think it's going to be just another added stressor on his life, but it turns out it's nothing serious); on the other hand, it could have just been some character building in trying to further ground Howie as, at the end of the day, a normal guy who has to go through these ""life/death"" risks of the mundane in life (not that health is mundane, but hopefully you get what I mean).",ef4qsw

Ironically the only film I've ever walked out of was Sandler's Don't Mess With the Zohan. I thought you put it better than most who hated Uncut Gems by saying it was more than you wanted to take and how it outweighed the potential interests you had, by the way.

Sandler is left broke, the girl says she doesn't care about the money yadda yadda, Sandler is distracted with some kind of bet ""Idk what it could have been"" and gets into a car accident and dies.

frhpn3c,"Gambling is one of the oldest methods of making a living along with prostitution and others things.  I know some people who thanks to gambling went from being homeless to having a mansion in the Hollywood hills and owning multiple sucessful businesses.  All thanks to gambling essentially.  Not everyone has gambling problems.  I don't even really think he has gambling problems in the movie.  After doing research I found that in NYC the police have access to recordings of all the jewelry stores so as soon as they found out about the robbery and homicides, they'd know who did it.  

So what the debt collectors did is extremely unrealistic.  They would have got their money had they not killed him and probably even more.  And like....  Why didn't they just kill him from the start and rob the jewelry store??  His decision to bet all the money was actually the smart thing to do.  It was a terrible way to end the movie, hands down.  It doesn't have to be a happy ending but it needs to be better than that.  How are you gonna end such a good movie like that?  I feel like I just got told ""F you"" by the production company.  I would have been furious if I saw that in the theatres and would have pulled a total karen and demanded my money back",ef4qsw

The guys collecting debt worked for Arnold and he was paying them to collect the debt.  They had enough of all the bullshit and they had the same mentality howard had.  Why settle with just getting paid what arnold paid them when they could just rob the store?

I still think it's a lame way to end the movie though.  I would have liked to see what the girl did with the money.  She could have just took off with it if she wanted too.",ef4qsw

The moment when we learn he's healthy coincides roughly with KG paying back his cash, so they combine to create a ""false ending"" where we get a happy resolution. In a sense, they're showing you what the ending could have been if Sandler weren't tragically flawed. He had every opportunity to walk away. His ditzy GF seemed to really love him. He was healthy.

That is way too abstract and convoluted to make any sense IMO. And he could have made it a condition to handing over the opal that he would have to stay with the player while he had it.

But that's my point, not really.  Even if he had paid Arno back in the beginning of the film, there is no reason to think >!the muscle guys would have killed him and Arno and looted the store!< - everything that happened in the film is really irrelevant to the 'denouncement'.

Storytelling that unfolds with emotional depth..stories that follow a fulfilling pattern of gratifying storytelling.

Younger people were raised on Jack-Ass, Jersey Shore, Hip Hop videos,  heavy metal music today is growling, yelling, screaming noise (whereas the metal of the 80's was melodic and 'musical.' )  Films today are all shakey-cam, fast cuts, and non stop movement.  Yelling, loud music, and constant camera movement (even the Today show has devolved into the non-stop camera moving) and the MCU is now considered to be fine art. (I'm sure you're aware of the Brouhaha over Scorsese's statement that ""Marvel movies are not cinema"" and all the angered responses it got?) The Safdie's even come from the 'jack ass', social media/youtube stunts world to begin with. 

Uncut Gems was *not* a good movie. did it encompass all the ""norms"" of filmmaking for a younger generation; loud, non stop, constant cacophony, constant movement? Yes, absolutely. Does that make it *Good?* That's another question entirely.

It was plotless, really. It was really more, ""A frenetic day in the life of..."" kind of film. That's fine in and of itself; it used to be that many independent films were 'character studies' Films like Jolene with Jessica Chastain, or Mysterious Skin with 	
Joseph Gordon-Levitt were just character studies, but they were exceedingly well made films; phenomenal writing, acting and directing, hands down. Uncut Gems? Not even close. So you couldn't even really get into the characters (except Julia, maybe- she was the most believable, best actor there) With Jolene and Mysterious skin you *see* the slow descent--or growth and rise--of the characters right in front of you.

Its was brutally loud, an assault on your senses, and it was non stop. I guess in your Jersey Shore, Jack Ass modern night club environs, where everyone is always yelling over each other and its always loud, that's normal and acceptable to younger crowds. But for older people--or anyone--who wants to see the character in action, see them act and react to situations and conversations--you can't do that in Uncut Gems. You can't even hear them most of the time over all the yelling.

You asked why older people don't like it, there's part of why. there were also too many script flaws, bad acting, Score was horrible and too fucking loud, and just Would. Not.

And I don't think its even necessary to root for Howard to enjoy the movie, because my takeaway from the movie was how destructive addiction and gambling can be. Howard is fundamentally an insecure man. The key scene here is when he is crying in his own office in front of his girlfriend and feels so pathetic that he doesn't even want to be looked at. And we can see it through the whole movie, but especially at the club scene where he looks out of place and clearly isn't really welcomed there. When he's down he makes feeble attempts at regaining the pleasant suburban family life that he once had, but he's winning big he goes back to being a complete dick because he feels like he's overcame his insecurities. But throughout the whole thing, he's basically powerless. He may be act like conniving and pompous asshole, who owns the world, but he spend the whole movie getting kicked around by a bunch of thugs and business partners, and he knows it. At the moment where he could have settled his debts and escaped the destructive, hectic lifestyle he was living, he gave this powerful speech to KG that pretty much sums up the feelings that he's chasing.

I just hated this entire experience from root to stem; I hated the tension, I hated the noisy busy-ness, I hated The Weekend, KG and LaKeith Stanfield, somehow, in this.

You should probably reread my post because *nowhere* did I criticize the narrative or the plot. In fact, I even stated the script, and the plot had potential, and was akin to independent film 'character studies' (and I named a couple of films) and had potential.

>Considering the Safdis themselves are Jews whose dad was a runner in NYC’s diamond district - all these things all seem more plausible that not.

And yet again, for the third time, Nowhere did I make any criticisms of the diamond district or how it operates or choosing that as a setting or that he's Jewish, or the veracity of the Passover Sader--my criticism was that all the characters in the films--including the Jews were all a bit over the top--they were all tropes--and they were. They were about as cliched as it can get.

You're criticizing me for things I didn't say, and not clear on the things I did say.

>Just because something is “electronic” doesn’t by default mean it can only be used in sci-fi. 

Just because you can film 10 hours and 7 minutes of paint drying on a wall doesn't mean you *should.* (Although, to be fair, there was an underlying reason.)

>You bringing Star Wars into this kind of paints you as the wrong demographic for this movie.

I could have mentioned the soundtrack to Conan the Barbarian by Basil Pouledoris, or Close Encounters of the Third Kind by John Williams, or even Chariots of Fire by Vangelis...all would have made my point. I arbitrarily chose Star Wars because everyone immediately knows the music, knows what it sounds like, understandds the iconic nature of it, an its relation to the film, and its a good example of an orchestral score supporting a film. That you think since I picked an iconic score from Star Wars *means* I must be a Star Wars fan....really means you have no idea what you're talking about. You have no ability to look at Film and art objectively (Yes I'm fully aware art is 'subjective') and assess them independently of your particular likes. If you like it, it must be good.

That for me was the entire tragedy of the end was from her point of view. Howard was a scumbag who more or less had it coming (not saying he deserved to get murdered but it would have happened at some point) whereas she was a girl in love who is going to go from the high of winning and everything she wants to grief of losing Howard to in the end being the most deserving of the money so at least there's that.",ef4qsw

The thought of having KG there, having him psyched up by this gemstone, and sending him out all hyped to win (and to win Howie an epic bet) was too much to pass up on. If it seems like it doesn’t make sense, it’s because addiction doesn’t make sense. You’re gambling (literally or figuratively), sometimes with your life. Sandler’s character is an adrenaline junkie and we’re along for the ride.

The thing to realize is, even at the end of the movie, with a potential huge payoff coming in, Howie isn’t better off. He owes money to multiple bookies, he sold all his friends’ rolexes, he’s traded his championship ring, he traded the dude’s Michael Jackson cross, he owes his dad (?) from the auction, and he likely has all sort of debts at home and elsewhere. Maybe he can pay off Arnold and a couple of others, but he’s so deep into addiction that he’d rather get that next big hit / win than pay off one of his debts.

fc3mau6,"I commented after I saw the movie yesterday, and though I don't actually know if this is what was intended, my theory is that the feeling when Howard was killed was intentional from the Safdies.

I personally felt unfulfilled due to the ending, but I think that the entire movie and all of the scheming and chaos and everything going on, and Howard finally hits his big win and can theoretically pay off his debts and live a semi-normal life, he gets killed unceremoniously. I think that's meant to leave the viewer feeling as Howard felt with his life, unfulfilled. There's a reason he gambled. He had what you'd consider a pretty desirable life, a pretty wife with three kids and a nice house, what would be seen as a lucrative profession as a jewelery shop owner/dealer, and yet he still had the innate desire for more.

The ending of the movie to me sort of summed this up, in that it left you wanting more, it made everything we'd just gone through for the 2.5 hour journey with Howard seem pretty meaningless, but again, I believe this was all intentional.",ef4qsw
fc4uzn7,"I personally took it as that even if they got the money back; they were just fucking sick of his ass and wanted to kill him. He just kept stringing them along with his bets and lying.

fc54hat,"Yeah the ending really didn’t make sense. 

1. The $ is on the way so why kill him and your boss on video. Your life is now over for double homicide. Best the guy to a pulp, break his legs. Put him in a coma. Don’t kill him. Why wouldn’t they raid his shop in the first place the entire movie?

2. What came of Julia, on her way back with a sack of cash. She also could have taken a check / alerted the casino of the goons. The guy she had cash the ticket would owe major taxes for the win so I doubt he just easily cashed it. Moheghan Sun doesn’t have a sports-book so why didn’t they send her to Atlantic City? And why did Howard tell them his plan exactly? Why couldn’t he just say he he was waiting in a check from KG? 

3. What was the point of the goofy bookie he owes and gave the fake Rolex to? He said it was “the last straw” but literally nothing came of that. He should have played a factor at the end. A much better ending would have been him recusing Howard at the end and then stealing the cash from Julia as she came in and taken Howard for everything.

Side note why is there like 0 mention of the first bet after it got canceled. It was 40k at 40-1 odds. 1.6 million. No street bookie is taking that action lol. They can’t pay it.",ef4qsw

But... it seems this decision was not made by the Safdie Brothers, it was the studio (which is a relief because Good Time was so skillful in its conclusion, that this detail didn't make sense to me).  

The actress who played Julia said: [Her ending] was actually added in after. We had shot the movie and wrapped at the end of November [2018], and then when they had the rough cut and they showed it to the studio, the studio was like, ‘No, we need to see [what happens to] Julia.’ 

> In fact, she may be in serious trouble when she gets back to the city because of the people looking to collect on Howie's debts.

This. You innately get it too, but the film frames her getting the money and escaping as a victory, which we now know wasn't the Safdies' choice. I blame the studio for this one.

But in the moment, she's just an obstacle to the plot you actually want to see (it's a crime movie, after all), and she's often somewhat clueless, so she's reduced to basically being a frustrating impediment, little more.

Dinah nominally fills that role, but I think the reasons it plays differently are 1. how well she understands the situation, and 2. the humor. Like, her actual plot function isn't all that different from the typical ""Wife Who Hates Fun Crime Stuff"", most of what we see from her is precisely that. But her role isn't actually to disrupt the energy of the movie (she doesn't actually *interfere* much with the antics we see in the movie), and no one can think she just ""doesn't understand"".

I think it was a way better execution of the trope than almost any I've seen. Similar superficial function, but those roles often underserve the women who play them, reducing them to an annoying cheap prop. Idina Menzel gets a very nice role here.",ef4qsw

I think it’s this more than anything. He’s been pushed around by Howard nonstop since the start of the movie and after being locked in that box for ~two hours he just did it. The very next thing he says as Arno starts framing out is “I can fix this,” which to me suggests he just did something he didn’t really mean to do and now needs to find a way out. They start smashing cases next to grab whatever they can, but they’re not getting out — so much of the movie has established that you can’t get out of that store without someone buzzing you out.

the look arno gave makes sense with what you are saying. he took a big risk and it paid off big. arno just wants his money back, plus some and he is good. arno is a businessman and thinks logically. no telling what arno would have done if howard loses. really good movie overall though.",ef4qsw

fc3o03n,">He offered 175 originally, 

Yes but 175 was already a super low ball offer because Howard initially told him it was worth millions, so KG already would have felt he was getting a deal at 175. 

On top of that, the auction house's max appraisal for the opal was higher than 175, so there's no reason why KG wouldn't have been willing to pay slightly more than that amount, because it was still within range of the appraised value.

It's not like he's not a penny pinching grandmother with a set budget who simply can't go slightly higher than the dollar amount of 175k. 

Also, it's not sunk cost fallacy at all, i'm not saying he would have continued to bid and pay whatever price *solely* because of the time he's already spent put into getting it. That would be sunken cost fallacy

 I'm saying he wouldnt have tapped out over an amount of money that equates to 50 bucks to an average person more than what he expected to pay for an item that the entire film spent demonstrating how valuable the object was to him. 

Again, he gave his SOLE championship ring to a stranger in exchange for the opal, performed amazingly while he had it then had a bad game when Howard took it back. KG was convinced that the opal was special and isn't going to be deterred by such a nominal amount. It's not realistic.",ef4qsw
fc3gsw8,"Yeah that's a good point. Although I don't recall anything in the scene indicating that KG had figured that out during the auction itself, but you probably right.

I know he said he figured it out after he met with Howard to buy it, but it would have made more sense if they showed KG's female assistant catching Howard making eye contact with Judd Hirsch's character, then whispering to him. (maybe that did happen but I dont recall it playing out exactly like that)",ef4qsw

And they didn't show anything to suggest he did.",ef4qsw
fc3i2ty,"I'd buy that if the Opal was going for 3-4 times the price of his original offer...but a difference of 20k for a guy as superstitious, competitive and RICH as KG is nothing.  If you *really* wanted something so bad that you went to an auction the morning of one of the biggest events of your work career and it went 50 bucks over the amount you expected to pay...you're more than likely going to say fuck it and spend the extra 50 to win. He's getting 170k per game, while playing an average of 3 games a week. 

There's nothing the woman could have said that would have swayed him over such an insignificant amount given how much that opal meant to KG.  To me, that just doesn't fit his character. 

Someone else who responded to me said the most likely and realistic conclusion is KG and the woman figured out during the auction that Howard was driving up the price, although even with that, there wasn't anything in the scene that indicated that to be the case..so it's still a tough sell. Maybe that's what the Safdie brothers intended but I wish they would have done a better job of conveying it.",ef4qsw
fc4lp0j,"Yup and remember it wasn't even 200k. He was already willing to pay 175...so it was only a difference of about 25k, literally peanuts to that man. He was in NYC the morning of a game 7 taking place in Boston solely to get the opal...a measly 20k isn't going to stand in his way.",ef4qsw
fc3ktv2,"Yup, the conclusion i've arrived at is that the Saafdie bros are so infatuated with creating chaotic and tense moments that they lose sight of reason while trying to build those moments. In a way, they're like Howard, chasing the thrill while throwing sense out the window.",ef4qsw

This could be seen as confirmation that Howard doesn't really care about jewish people or black people, despite being jewish himself and regularly doing work with black people. It shows that he has no consideration for the extent that his actions reach. He acts like he put a lions' share of the effort into finding that opal, when the people mining it have literally broken their bones in a country where, realistically, that would become a permanently disabling injury.

I agree. With the cloud based CCTV, them smashing all the cases, and not knowing how to get the door to open with the nail file, I figure they will be caught before even leaving the building. Howard's wife says she's calling the cops at the end, they'll catch the goons trying to get out.

If Howard wasn't killed at the end then Uncut Gems 2 would be him paying child support to Dinah(and eventually to Julia), while his kids grow up to hate him.

In that moment he was happy, but he never would’ve been truly satisfied. That’s why the thugs killed him, they were tired of chasing money that Howard was never going to give them.",ef4qsw

When he sold the gem and then bet the money immediately, with a smile on his face, that is not sympathetic.  That is disgustingly immoral.  When he pawned Garnett's ring and used that money to gamble, same thing.  There was nothing but selfishness in ANY of his decisions.  

Walter White expertly got his wife cleared of suspicion and was genuinely broken when Hank died.  Howard apologized to his wife and in the next scene was back with his concubine.  He had no remorse when his friend got screwed out of $190,000.  He was only frustrated that his plan didn't work.

Howard was a bad person with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  The writers did not want you to sympathize with him at all.

That is way too abstract and convoluted to make any sense IMO. And he could have made it a condition to handing over the opal that he would have to stay with the player while he had it.

I've watched all of these films and enjoyed them. I also am willing to bet the films I've watched are much more expansive and diverse than the average old person.

But it was the point in his office when he breaks down and admits his wrong doings. That really sealed it for me why people are saying he should be nominated. That was some powerful shit.

I'd rate this 8/10 just based on the performances they milked out of people who don't normally star in films. The original score was out of place and served no other purpose than inducing anxiety. The artsy 2001-style gem and colonoscopy shots were also snagging some big EYE ROLLS from me.",ef4qsw

Howard sees the opal as the maximum valuation it could possibly reach. Just like he sees cash as a vehicle to gamble to get more cash. Or valuables as something which can be used as collateral for a loan to make those other bets. The value of these things to Howard lies in the way they could generate *more* value. 

Of course, that's not how it actually works (at least, at the rate that Howard wants it to). Gambling is the sort of vehicle that can make that mentality plausible (and Howard always sees that upside).",ef4qsw

But anyway, Howard may lack redeeming qualities but it’s the way Sandler portrays the character that makes him likable, and not a list of his bad deeds. The scene where he’s trying to get the stone from Demany and he’s just ignoring him telling him to leave, that was definitely frustrating and a subtle way to get you to share the same frustration and anxiety as Howard. Even sharing emotions with him during tense scenes is still a level of sympathy, you see how much it means to him and since we spend most of the time with him in the movie, you’re on his side by association. I definitely rooted for Howard even though he lacked decency, that’s what makes it a unique story. That’s what make the Safdie Bros movies stand out. You may not have sympathized with Howard but others have, and I think they leave it open to be divisive. If you don’t sympathize with Howard, then that entire climax doesn’t work. How are you supposed to be caught up in the heat of the bet if you don’t give a shit what happens to Howard?

He is not a winner because he wins, I think he is a loser/degenerate because of what he does to get to the alledged ""win"". There are a lot of ways to make money, there are a lot of disgusting people who have earned or stolen a lot of money, I wouldn't call them ""winners"". Would he even have the ""cute chick"" if he didn't have the money?  


Is there anything in the film that went well for him? He constantly gets beaten up, he is constantly getting swindled by the people he knows, he keeps swindling the people he knows, his GF cheats on him (""you know what I was before...""). His wife doesn't want ANYTHING to do with him. Instead of tucking his kid in he is immersed in his basketball game because he has money on it, not because he enjoys it. His older kid is telling him that he has a bet on the game with some other kid (is he a good role model?) He tried to give a Rolex to his bookie and they have so little respect for him that he denied a gift or a Rolex (not because it was fake). He completely screws up the Opal auction because he didn't get his own appraisal; it was 100% his fault. His attempt to fix the ""him not getting an appraisal"" turned into yet another cluster fuck by him having his dad/in-law bid and win the auction, so he screwed him too. Then he calls the athlete to sell it to him again and looked like a fool; and he says the dumbest thing possible, ""this is how I win.""  


Think about that quote, ""this is how I win"" and who he says it to. He says this to an athlete, that practices his craft, is painted as an honest person, hardworking, he is a leader of a team, he goes out there and he wins the game every time and the person that is telling him, ""this is how I win..."" is a cheater, does everything wrong, is not part of ""any' team, never wins, and always looses.

All the big things in his life are fuckups. His marriage, his Opal auction, his last big bet.

Here is what he doesn't have, a good relationship with his children, or his wife, or his extended family members, or his employees or his business associates.

most movies show a character going thru an arc of a lifetime within 2 hours,

yet the stark reality is that many people either take years for those types of changes, or never change at all.

the only thing that left me unsatisfied was Arno's role/hierarchy next to Phil...was Phil actually the boss?

But the culture we're raised in makes an indelible impression on us politically, artistically, and morally, and shapes our 'likes' especially when it comes to music and film, for example. If you're raised in the 80's heavy metal means one thing; if you're raised in the 20Teens it means something else entirely. If you're raised in the 80's Superhero movies mean one thing; if you're raised in the 20Teens it's an entirely different ballgame. For someone over 40 the Road Warrior is the definitive Mad Max film; for someone younger, nothing can touch Fury Road...and so on.

I'm not making an absolute argument; I'm simply answering the question asked. And I do think the specifics I gave: fast edits, loud music, the ""youtube prankster/Jack Ass"" attention getting mentality will more broadly appeal to the younger generation who grew up with that as completely normal, whereas older folks dont see a guy deliberately driving staples into his scrotum as remotely entertaining.

And I'm certainly not assuming older folks are necessarily more discriminating and have fine art taste simply by virtue of being older--not even close!

fc368gx,"Are you saying there will be blood is political drivel? I feel like the more we talk about this the more connections you’ll notice between Uncut Gems and There Will Be Blood, a movie which I agree is more explicitly about capitalism. (Also the directors were explicitly inspired by PT Anderson’s work for this film in particular.)

Capitalism is about more than ownership and industry, it’s also about prioritizing economic growth above quality of life. Whereas Plainview represents pure sociopathic capitalist ambition, Howard acts as more of a stand in for the contradictions of capitalism. As we watch Howard the audience is constantly asking “why are you doing this to yourself and the people in your life?” Despite him often making incredibly lucrative business moves. 

Listen I’m not saying the movie is pure political commentary, part of what makes it so effective is the gritty chaotic style it’s shot in that perfectly captures that lifestyle and Howard’s mental state. Its cool I saw this movie 3 days ago now and it really hasn’t gotten out of my head.",ef4qsw
fc1xnrt,"“I disagree” - in Howard voice. 

I think the movie gets pretty on the nose about how it’s about a lot more than a gambling addiction. There’s a reason the opening scene starts with exploited workers in Ethiopia and turns into a literal colonoscopy. 

Howard doesn’t even care about money, his obsessive need to be the beacon of security for everyone in his life while simultaneously destroying his life... it’s a totally fair interpretation on my end to think it’s about how we value capital above bodies.

At that point in the movie he also had a lot more time, things hadn't quite ramped up yet so he isn't feeling the pressure as much.

Don't need to drag it out showing him schlep it up with his family. 

My problem with the Weeknd scene is the same. Dragged out to establish too small of a detail that doesn't have much of an impact in the long run. That's what I mean by filler. Why go through the trouble of establishing Lakeith's relationship with Sandler when he has no impact outside of just introducing Kevin Garnett? It's not the base of the scene that's filler, it's the dragging out of those scenes and the fact these scenes don't add any extra anxiety. 

I think the interpretation of the movie is entirely subjective. You may like the fact that the Passover scene is stretched out and you may find tension in seeing Howard and his brother in law (or whatever the fuck he was) awkwardly eat challah and avoid their argument, but I found it frustrating and slow. You may have liked the ending and found it bold to have him not win in the end, as he so clearly didn't deserve to. But, to me, it was frustrating to go the whole movie being made to root for such a shitty character, only for the payoff to not be there. It's totally subjective.

To me there wasn't any growth, there wasn't any character development, it was just 2 hours of ""Watch this asshole be an idiot"" which I just don't think is all that entertaining, especially when people are hyping it for oscars.

fcj5ts1,"Seeing as how the entire story of the movie is how he owes money he doesn't have and needs to pay it back I would not consider him to be successful, or have ever been truly successful. He has to pawn a ring he doesn't even own to get money to gamble so I wouldn't exactly call his business thriving.

And the implication is that he sold off the watches that Demany owned. Near the end Demany goes to grab his watches and half of them are missing. We have seen Howard get one stolen off of him by the goons and he gave one away to pay off another guy asking for his money. You also hear Demany during that scene asking where the papers are (they aren't there because Howard sold the real watches), and near the end the guy he gave the watch to is there because he said the watch was a fake.

Oh and The Weeknd chain is another. I don't think it covered how exactly he got the chain, but we see him sell it off, then when he goes to that party I believe the one guy is asking about it.

The entire story really is about how much of a fuck up this guy is ruining his life with gambling. He gives off the illusion of success by having a nice house, a second apartment, and a ""thriving"" jewelry business. At no point do I ever get the vibe that this guy built a successful business. He's been flying by the seat of his pants his entire life",ef4qsw

I still absolutely loved the film and think that the goon shooting Howard was a great and sensible way to end it, but I couldn't shake those two goofy-looking guys out of my mind. I expected one brother to kill Howard and the other to follow Julia with the implication being that he is going to take the money and/or kill her to settle Howard's debt and that would have been the ending. It might have been great in a really ironic way that two very non-threatening looking guys end up being the ""big bads"". It might have really underscored that it was all the stupid little decisions Howard made that really fucked him over in the end.

Just starting from the point where she understands how much he’s a fuckup, lets us not waste time going through the motions with that pointless drama, and lets  her be a much stronger character.

We see doctors performing a colonoscopy (it's close up so if your girlfriend has a phobia of that tell her to close her eyes).
Howard's wife flinches him (played for laughs). 

Kevin Garnett accidentally shatters a plate of glass (light jumpscare).

Howard attacks a man for stalking his family, he bites him and then tries to escape but he's forced into a van, stripped of his clothes and possessions, and put in a car trunk.

Demany pours juice/wine into an aquarium, killing the fish (if you don't like animal abuse).
Howard is suddenly punched in the face and thrown into a water fountain.

Howard is shot and killed at the very end. This is quite jarring. Arno, another mobster, is also shot and killed for resisting.

fh6eapi,"Lots of people love the movie, so I'm not trying to convince anyone that they're wrong and I'm right.  But since you responded, if you want to get a better sense of where I'm coming from:

I've never seen or read Lolita, so I can't comment on that.  But to your other 2 examples:

Hannibal is a great example of what I'm talking about. Silence of the Lambs is the film that made Hannibal Lecter a screen icon.  He's not the protagonist--he's only in the film for like 15 minutes--and he's brilliant, mysterious, charming, and ultimately 'likable' because despite being a psychopath, he is quickly protective towards Clarice Starling, the audience surrogate.  When Starling first goes to meet Lechter, another prisoner, Miggs, assaults her by throwing his ejaculate at her through the prison bars.  At their second meeting, Starling learns that Lechter was so offended on her behalf that he convinced Miggs to kill himself.  That's what some screenwriters call a ""Save the Cat"" moment.  

Chernobyl is a great example of the story being more about the events around the characters rather than the characters themselves.  Even in that story, there are also interesting, compelling characters--Jared Harris' character is a scientist who is committed to speaking the truth no matter the cost, while Stellan Skarsgaard is an arrogant bureaucrat who must learn to fight back against the corrupt Soviet propaganda system once he realizes the true scale of the crisis.  The two men also grow to respect each other over the course of the series.

Here's my problem with Uncut Gems: I had no reason to root for Howie, and nothing happened during the film that elevated the stakes, so there was no arc--either internal or external--for me.  At the very opening of the film, he's deeply in debt and being violently confronted by loan sharks.  At the end of the movie, he's deeply in debt and being violently confronted by the same loan sharks.  In between, he meets KG, the opal arrives, and he spends the rest of the film trying to get the opal back, trying to sell the opal, running from the sharks, etc.  But it's all essentially the same thing.  He's deeply in debt, and if he doesn't successfully sell the opal, he'll be... still deeply in debt.  And we never get a ""save the cat"" moment for him.  Have him give a homeless guy $20 at the beginning of the movie or something!  I'm easy to manipulate as a viewer, but there are certain things I want from a protagonist if I'm going to spend 2 hours with them.  

If anything, the Safdies seem to intentionally give us more reasons to dislike him--he's a liar, he cheats on his wife, he's a shitty father, etc.  He sucks.  And all of his problems are of his own doing, and the story around him isn't some grand adventure or major event.  It's a series of mundane events with a bunch of guys from New York central casting for ""shady character actors.""  I see all this stuff about how it's about gambling addiction, but I never saw any real indication that Howie wants to change.  So if there's no inner conflict for the character, and if the only real conflict is a series of external pressures that are caused by the protagonist's own stupid decisions, then it's a farce.  That can work well for a comedy (if it's funny), or a tragedy (if the character is compelling), but I wasn't rooting for Howie, so I didn't give a shit what happened to him.

To contrast this with the Safdie's previous feature, Good Time: Robert Pattinson's character was a similarly self-destructive character, but he spends the majority of the movie trying to get money **so he can get his disabled brother out of Rikers**.  He clearly loves and cares for his brother--it's established in the very first scene.  So that was enough to get me to be on his side, despite all the ridiculous and idiotic decisions he makes over the course of the film.  That's why I liked Good Time a lot more than Uncut Gems.",ef4qsw

And they never would have fought...and broke up, and get kicked out of the apt...and so on. So, its a good attempt to make the pieces fit, but they don't.

What the Safdies did was go at it backwards: They created situations to escalate the conflict before working out if those situations actually add up in order to make sense.

I mean, Howard bit his henchmen, jerked this guy around for weeks, pushed him to lockers, had his ""security"" (Kgs, but the guy took it as Howards) rough him up. We never saw him truly lose it throughout any of these scenes (especially not violently enough to cause serious harm to Howard). If we take the last scene of him threatening howard, he's seen throwing Howard into a fountain, after Howard repeatedly ignored threats to walk away. He could've done far worse, but he just threw him in a fountain. It seems quite a stretch to me the guy would go from that, to straight up murdering the guy (and even if he wanted to, in a store with cameras? would've just waited till they were outside, or drag him outside away from the cameras, etc.).

Like Lord of War is Nick Cage's best film, in where for some reason this usually horrifically good/baddd actor is a perfect and I mean perfect role for a character, Sandler oozes a somehow more apt character than I've ever seen him do before.

He definitely seemed like an enforcer, but pretty much did all the enforcing without any physical pain. It was almost cartoonish their interactions with Sandler. Dunking him out the window, taking his clothes off and leaving him in the trunk, usually these interactions come with a solid beating and there was none of that. And then all of a sudden he just shoots Sandler and his ""boss."" It's unclear what the relationship was with Arno, but if they were working for him, why did they all of a sudden shoot him, and why were they working for him anyway? I get that there psychos out there who don't care about consequences, but it just seems like a half baked storyline.

You're right that KG *could have* paid anything for it, **but** in KG's mind, 175 was the right price for it. For whatever weird, superstitious reason, KG thought the gem brought him luck, and he also thought it was only worth 175k. There's consistency of character and writing there, so that makes sense.

However! We still have absolutely no reason to think KG knew he was being played at the auction. Nothing is said or shown to suggest it, and we have no reason to think he did. So we have absolutely no reason to think he knew he was being played at the auction.

If someone forces you to be somewhere you don't want to be and then spends the entire time laughing at you from behind a window, it's very easy to find yourself making peace with the situation by deciding what you're going to do to the person once they let you out.
