dckslw7,"I don't think Jim Parsons or Kristin Dunst were really the antagonists. I don't think anybody was really the antagonist. In spite of that, though, it's remarkable how *oppressive* the atmosphere felt.

Late in the movie, when Katherine is running across the campus, I was pretty keyed in to the urgency of the moment. Millions of dollars and the life of John Glenn was on the line, and not to mention the reputation of NASA and of the American space program in general in the context of the cold war. She's her ass off half a mile away, in heels, to do her duty. And when she's here and hands the book off to verify her calculations, she's won a small victory.....and then the door closes right in her face.

I felt the oppression there. The frustration that comes with being able to do everything right, yet nobody will care. She then quietly composes herself and realizes ""her place,"" and my heart broke.

Spencer's character at the library just trying to find the right book, one which is not in the colored section. Monae's character being reminded that the colored seats are in the back of the court room. And later ""noticing"" that there are no colored seats in her class. Katherine running across campus just to find a bathroom that she is allowed to use and never once complaining about it until she is publicly berated about her use of time. Kevin Costner appearing to be a generally good person who doesn't care about race, and yet still never even thought about the difficulty of being forced into a certain bathroom half a mile away.

This movie certainly has its problems. I won't disagree with many of them. But I just don't care. As a white male, it's hard for me to really appreciate how pervasive this kind of oppression can be. It sits above you, looming over every interaction. For the first time I think I finally have a small glimpse of true understanding. And for that, I really appreciate the movie.  ",5mi2hq
dc40ban,"Here is the comparison between truth and the movie:

http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/hidden-figures/

To summarize:

1) All major white characters except the astronauts are either composites or fictional.

2) Several major career events in the black characters lifes are shifted by years.  For example, Vaughn became the first black supervisor in 1948.  This made the movie more dramatic but NASA look more racist.",5mi2hq
dc3s47l,"It's much better than I was expecting as a biography, especially when you learn that all three of the history-making main characters actually worked together, and I appreciated the look into the world of the space race when it was first starting out.

I liked how it portrayed math nerdiness, and while the commentary on prejudice was on the nose, it was also accurate. Shit was ugly then, and discrimination took many forms, and it wasn't ""pandering"" to the topics at all. 

It was an entertaining movie that derived drama from the historic work done by historic character in oppressive times.

PS: why does this post not get a sticky compared to the other two?",5mi2hq
dc40thv,"That scene where Kevin Costner bashed down the ladies restroom sign was definitely the most powerful moment in the film for me. I'm glad that although racism and segregation was rampant during that time, there were still many others out there who were like ""come on fam, let's just get shit done.""",5mi2hq
dccqurl,"I went to see today at the matinee. I was surprised at how full the theater was. I liked it and so the rest of the audience, as far as I could tell. Everyone laughed at all the right moments and such.",5mi2hq
dcxddsg,"The acting in this movie was really good, and the story told is fascinating and worth telling. The movie has a couple of powerful scenes, I especially like [the scene in the bathroom, when Kirsten Dunst's character says ""I have nothing agains you all"", and Octavia Spencer ""I know you probably believe that"". Great writing, so much told in one short sentence.](#spoiler), but other than a couple of scenes, the movie is pretty much paint-by-numbers from start to finish.

Not that that's a bad thing, mind you, it's just that playing it safe doesn't make a great movie.",5mi2hq
dc3rlz2,"Maybe I just needed a not depressing film right now but I couldn't hate Hidden Figures. Oh I know it's not perfect. The script is painfully on the nose, many of the white characters exist as strawmen, and the score sounds like Zimmer was asleep. However I think the acting (particularly from the three main lead women) and some strong scenes makes this a pretty solid watch. There's just some nice moments like the engagement scene or Mary Jackson in court. It's totally what you expect from this kind of movie but it never felt so pandering to me that I hated it. It's sort of a perfect movie to show high-school students. Something to teach people about important figures in history in a positive way. 

I won't stand out on a limb for this film but I'd say it's at least a decent watch. If you hated it I totally get it but for me it was a nice surprise.",5mi2hq
ddasvet,"Praise:

Fantastic acting from 3 leads (Octavia, Janelle & Taraji)

Great story with a few powerful 1-liners 

The bathroom scenes, first meeting with CPL, car scene and IBM scenes were really good

Feel good ending (is someone cutting onions in here?)

Criticisms: 

Very 'PG'. 

There weren't any real antagonists aside from (in hindsight) a broken/backwards society. 

It was a little ""hokey"". There are much more powerful on the topic. ",5mi2hq
dc6ubq7,"It's interesting seeing all comments half-complaining that the racism and sexism wasn't shown more 'seriously'. It wasn't violent or in-your-face or dark and gritty - but it was *there*. At every step of the way it was there. They had to fight tooth and nail over and over and over and over just to get the same basic dignity afforded to their coworkers. And they did it with grace and poise - [aside from that one glorious rant Katherine got in](#spoiler). I may not have to deal with it on the level they've had, but as a woman and as a computer programmer, a lot of those micro aggressions hit home for me.

Overall the movie met and exceeded all of my expectations. The cinematography, pacing, costuming, acting, and (very few) vfx where on point. As for historical accuracy, I know they condensed timelines a bit and cut things down and combined characters to make it work on screen, but the core of the story was kept intact. The achievements of those women are 100% true and it was a joy to see it come to life on the screen.

10/10 - one of my favorite historical biopics I've ever seen.",5mi2hq
dc4275o,How many sticks of gum did Costner put in his mouth throughout this movie? But it was pretty good. Just could have done without the whole love story sub plot. It didn't really have much to do with the other three waaay more interesting stories.,5mi2hq
dc3vssh,"This was so much fun and it made me wish more biographical/historical dramas were comedy-dramas instead. I'd take this over *The Theory of Everything* any day, for instance. The humor humanized the three women so well and really made the film a celebration of their lives, as it should be. The wit/banter of all three characters was an effective way of *showing* their intellect (as opposed to the scenes of them solving math problems, which, to a clueless audience, is really just *telling*).

If she continues acting, Janelle Monae's going to be a star-- too bad this film wasn't made after her breakout performance in *Moonlight*, or she'd probably have been given a meatier arc. I also thought it was clever to cast two very well-known comedic actors, Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons, to play the (realistically nuanced) ""villains"". The best part about racists is rooting against racists and both actors did a good job of making their characters delightfully insufferable without becoming caricatures. 

I thought Taraji P. Henson was just fantastic, and it's a pity that she isn't getting much attention as a lead-- Octavia Spencer's performance, while good, was far less memorable. 

Also, is it fascinating or what that the events of this movie and *Loving* took place at the same time in the same state? Even though the core issue is the same, they feel so different.",5mi2hq
dd5poqq,"I really liked this movie.  Yes, it was extremely on the nose and seemed way too Hallmark and ooey gooey at times, but I knew it wasn't going to be a super challenging drama or anything.  So I just let myself enjoy it.  Sometimes it's nice to just relax into a feel good movie.",5mi2hq
ddms7ag,"Good movie but i did find it to be a bit hokey, a bit patronizing, and a bit overacted at times.  A bit too heavy on the facial acting to convey emotion for my taste",5mi2hq
dcshar8,"A wonderfully told story, and an important one at that, but I felt that this was too Hollywood-ified vs. what the real history is. Also, the math that was on the big blackboards was laughably simplistic, almost to the point of being patronizing.",5mi2hq
dd6oc02,[deleted],5mi2hq
dc3z8f9,"I hope this movie becomes one of those feel good classics that tv channels run when they want to fill a chunk of time. I remember that's how The Color Purple ended up being one of my favorite movies. 

That being said, this is definitely worth a watch. Go see it in theaters and get the experience of laughing, gasping, and crying with an audience. If anything this movie is very charming. 

Favorite scene is between Octavia Spence and Kirsten Dunst when they have a conversation in the bathroom. 1) Because Octavia Spencer has a last line that throws so much shade I could feel the sun eclipse and 2) It captures a very real side of racial tensions in a palatable way. It's played as a comedic moment but highlights a harsh reality and I think there's some skill in crafting those kinds of moments. ",5mi2hq
dc4ak0m,"It definitely has that old-Hollywood feel-good sheen, but honestly considering the subject matter and where we are in American culture and race relations right now, I think that's exactly what it needed. I laughed, I cried, all three leads did a fantastic job, and the ""edits"" they made historically were actually much more mild than I expected. I also found a lot of the scenes from the trailer that I thought would be ridiculously cheesy were more subtle/believable in context. 

I'm a huge fan of Janelle Monae's music and artistry so it was awesome to see her hold her own in such a Star-studded movie!",5mi2hq
dcb3a7r,"I really liked the movie overall. I think there were some problems here and there: maybe this is just me, but it kind of felt like since [they put Dorothy in charge of the computers and Katherine's big heroic moment occurred because the computers were wrong, to me it sort of made it seem like that only happened because Dorothy fucked up](#spoiler). Also it felt like they just sort of forgot to write and ending to Mary's arc. Maybe the ending was supposed to be[ that she started classes](#spoiler), but it felt left hanging to me, especially in comparison to the other two. 

That said, I still found the movie very good overall. I enjoyed all three leads, but I agree that Janelle Monae was the standout. Nice to see Mahershala Ali (who I remain convinced is roughly 85% teeth) and Janelle Monae together on screen again after Moonlight, even if only briefly. I a little bit had the thought of like ""Wow, I can't believe I'd never heard of these women"" followed quickly by ""Well.. actually I'd never heard of any of the men either.""

Mostly irrelevant sidenote: I definitely did not know that Euler is pronounced like oy-ler. I always assumed it was yoo-ler. Educational movie!",5mi2hq
dcnb5sw,These women were truly amazing. Starting a car by poking the alternator with a screwdriver is downright magical.,5mi2hq
dcs0q6q,"Was I the only one who kept seeing Sheldon?

Edit: I think the casting of Jim was great, though.",5mi2hq
dcqylro,I was surprised to not see a slide rule anywhere. Did I just miss it? I assume they would still be widely used at that time.,5mi2hq
dc3vrrn,"My main issue with the movie is that it's too on the nose, it literally screams ""this movie is supposed to be inspiring"" at the audience. 

That doesn't keep it from being good though! The alternative is to really dig into the racism/sexism that the women were facing in a more serious manner and that would have utterly changed the complexion of the movie.

The acting is good all around, Janelle Monae and Octavia Spencer do good work with the small roles they're given (it's really Taraji P Henson's movie). Kevin Costner is getting really good at the grizzled vet who lends gravitas to the ongoing affairs.

It's not going to displace any of my picks for the best of the year, but it's still a fine movie on a subject that hasn't been explored in movie to date.",5mi2hq

I also liked how racism was depicted.  a lot of movies want to focus on the Bull Connors and the Lovings being dragged out of bed in the middle of the night and such but this everyday kind of indifference and unwillingness to challenge the status quo was just as damaging and far more common. The scene with the librarian stood out to me. That woman probably wasn't 'racist' but she didn't want to risk her job nor did she care enough to want to change the situation.

dc3shk6,"I've got nitpicks. 

Janelle's character is sidelined for a good chunk of the movie in the middle which is a little awkward and Octavia is kind of muted too. 

If you're going to tease the ugly side of fighting for your rights...we get two snatches of it and it cuts away. I know it existed in the time but *that* felt like shoehorning. ""Oh, we have to put it somewhere, so here you go."". Did Aldis Hodge shoot his scenes in a day?

I'm not sure how true to life the final 'oh the heat plate is melting' segment is but in a movie already filled with tension, it felt almost like dumbing it down. Was it not tense enough having these women in situations where they weren't seen as human? Probably not to most of the moviegoing audience this movie was trying to appeal to. So they slapped it on knowing people's empathy wouldn't reach far enough.

I bet there's going to be a lot of comments about how the white people were one dimensional; I thought they seemed pretty true to the time. They don't think they have prejudices but they totally do. They have *variations* in their racism; not all of them are these idiot caricatures. People have a tendency to think think they're better people than they are, and it's no different in the present day.

The score was really beautiful. You can hear some kind of weird mumbling over something light at points and it was a standout. Everyone acted very well, and I'm happy to see Mahershala Ali again so soon after Moonlight.

I didn't hate this movie, not by a longshot, but 'made for tv movie edited to feature length' seems about right. I'm glad this story was told, but for another similar story, I do think Queen of Katwe did this rags to legends story a little better.",5mi2hq

dcc6m0p,"Some comments on race and politics in the film and the audience coming up:

I saw this film in a really small agricultural town in central Missouri, a very red place with about a 5% black population, otherwise overwhelmingly white. I was certain my wife and I would be the only two people in the theater; my wife is a scientist, and although she's not black, she has some experience being excluded or condescended to by her male colleagues. 

But the theater was actually nearly full and the audience very responsive. They laughed out loud when the film was using humor, and gasped and muttered at some of the most offensive racial parts. At the end of the film, people applauded. I was quite surprised.

I'm not sure what about this story appealed so much to everyone else in the theater. I'm certain about 95% of the town I live in (and probably people in the theater) voted for Trump, who stoked racial tensions and we have yet to know the lengths of his involvement with Russian interlopers into the U.S. election. [The Cold War tensions with the Soviets was a major motivation in the plot. International competition to get to space, and anxiety about nuclear war... the characters made it a matter of personal pride and safety to help the U.S. prevail through science and math.](#spoiler) I couldn't help but wonder if my fellow citizens who are very conservative drew any comparisons to the recent election and the way Trump and his most fervent supporters seem to downplay his relationship with Russia. [The outdated cars, clothes, technology, and segregation may make us wince or cringe, or maybe even laugh at how quaint it all is, but I can't help but wonder if American national pride is just as outdated, or so transformed that it's unrecognizable now. Large groups of Americans seem to tolerate what seems like concrete evidence of election tampering when the Space Race and abstract anxiety about a potential nuclear war was profound enough to change U.S. society in the late 1950s.](#spoiler) Maybe not large groups; honestly, I can't tell how many people seem to tolerate this interference.

Maybe the film's emphasis [on the main characters having an active presence in church was why the local theater was so packed, and the audience so enthusiastic.](#spoiler) But anyone else who wants to take guesses, feel free. 

I liked the film and I'm glad it's doing so well. [The scene with Kevin Costner taking a hammer to the ""colored ladies restroom"" sign was a bit over the top though. A bit too ""nerdy quiet white guy becomes heroically enraged for justice"". Seemed like the most manufactured aspect of the film.](#spoiler)

Also I liked the subtle nature of bringing people together after showing scenes of segregation. Such as when a group of people gathered around a TV set outside a store window to watch a launch. That was a diverse group of people. 

It may be a ""typical"" film in a film world, but as a history lesson...to teach people about who helped the launches launch? It was remarkable. And it got me to the theater. 

I USED to go every weekend. I USED to see every film. The last few years I haven't wasted my time on films that much. They redundant and boring. I only go when I'm compelled to go. And this film compelled me. 

It's amazing what people did back when. They didn't sit on their hands and bemoan how things are unfair. They actually did things because they knew they could be first....that it is possible to be first...that they didn't have to wait for someone else to be first. They put forth effort.

dc49jp5,"This movie was hilariously over-the-top with its attempts to be emotional.  Did Kevin Costner ever speak normally?  I think he gave a moving inspirational speech every time he opened his mouth. If someone wasn't walking bravely into a room of generic white men who looked surprised, or giving a tearful speech, or focusing on a Colored Women sign, then they were doing pretend science to remind us how sciency they were.  

Holy hell, movie, take a two second break from the inspiring music now and then.  If they had maybe 70% less moments of dramatic crescendo (so about an hour and 20 minutes less of that) and a few more minutes of character development or just people acting normal, I would have not disliked this so much.

The one guy who looked confused the whole movie?  That's ALL he did.  What's your job dude?  Glenn?  Look dashing and that's all.  Kevin, nows a great time to call out a woman on bathroom usage, using your big dramatic speech voice ina. Room full of people.  Oh and what were those people even doing?  The computer is running so that replaces the one black woman, the rest of you can stay.  But now I'm nitpicking.

From a real article, March 1962:

dc5fa6x,"Me personally I absolutely loved this movie. Too often history in the classroom is white-washed and inspiring black figures are hidden so that black children have nobody to look up to. This movie is absolutely essential. It delves into the truth and reality of the US's space program, and the fact that we absolutely would not have been able to even get a person into orbit without the vital contributions of black people. I personally enjoyed and relished every scene where the racist whites were shown that they don't know nearly as much as they think they do. I think Kevin Costner got a bit too much screen time, and the person in the leadership role who brought everyone together should have been a black person as well, or at least a homosexual.

I find it very upsetting that racism is still alive and well enough today that not many people went to see it opening weekend. It opened 18th if I remember correctly. Of course with this now being the country of Trump voters, I guess I couldn't really expect much else. I'm sure the Chinese opening will put this movie in the upper echelons where it belongs.
I fully believe this movie should be made a part of public school curriculum. It should be shown to children in grade school so that black kids have role models to look up to, and the white kids can be reminded of how they should conduct themselves. As someone else commented, the movie should also be shown on TV so it reaches a wider audience (and not just BET).

Imitation game at times looks like a spy thriller with a screenplay by Quentin Tarantino, and comparatively, Theory of Everything is playing it safe.

It's the same with Hidden Figures, depicts racial strife in the 60s but was made today, when racial strife is admittedly different, but still prevalent. 

Its attempting to blur the lines and provide inspiration for those suffering in a modern era, and if you have to take a few historical liberties to get that message across, so be it. If everyones living in relative comfort, then theres no point to the movie being made.

It had something most films about race or gender miss: intersectionality.

They faced sexism within their own race. They faced sexism and racism at work. They faced overt racism from society, and from other women. They faced sheer ignorance of how bad the situation was.

Most films are only about the protagonist in their struggle. The protagonist succeeds, the antagonist is defeated or learns their lesson. Audience feels good. This one the protagonists took as many other women with the as possible. And it linked up common struggles of inequality, and presented many of them in a way that women and *especially* black women still face. And then set it in a way that invites the audience do do what those women did, regardless of gender and race. To identify the small daily moments where you can make a difference.

Wow, this is some next level logic you're using. So lemme get this straight: 

Owning guns = strong indication of white supremacy. 

I wonder if someone told this guy: http://i.imgur.com/rNXAAIg.jpg

Oh wait, you probably don't know who that is due to the white-washing in classrooms. 

Idolization of Norse Mythology = Strong indication of white supremacy.

Oh of course you're actually spot on with this one. I mean there's just no way that I could be calling back to my German, Danish, and Norwegian heritage and the fact that I follow the Asatru faith and try to live my life by the nine noble virtues of which none pertain to racism or hatred. So good job catching that one...

So moving on to your idiocy:

> Too often history in the classroom is white-washed and inspiring black figures are hidden so that black children have nobody to look up to.

Hmm, now I can't speak for everyone or the schools they went to. But I personally went to 5 different schools growing up, 2 elementary, 2 middle, and one high. History is one of my favorite subjects and I have a pretty respectable knowledge of prominent black people throughout history, both American and World. As a matter of fact I even knew about Dorothy Vaugn from a computer class I took where we briefly explored the formula translation language. This was in the early 90s in Florida. Maybe schools have changed today and the white-washing has been turned up to 11, but I somehow doubt that very seriously. 

>  I think Kevin Costner got a bit too much screen time, and the person in the leadership role who brought everyone together should have been a black person as well, or at least a homosexual.

I'd really love to hear you give a logical explanation for this. Kevin Costner's character is apparently an combination of 2 or 3 directors from that time, all of which were white, none of whom were homosexual. 


> I find it very upsetting that racism is still alive and well enough today that not many people went to see it opening weekend. It opened 18th if I remember correctly.

So does every other civilized human being, you're not unique in this matter. I'm incredibly disappointed that we're going from President Obama to the Godking of hatred, misogyny, and racism but hey, it is what it is. We put on our adult pants and move the fuck on. Armchair activism changes nothing but that's a discussion for another time. 

I think someone else already explained the ""opening weekend"" numbers, let THIS weekend finish and we will see where it stands. I just saw it today and my theater was packed full to which I was pleasantly surprised. 

> I fully believe this movie should be made a part of public school curriculum. It should be shown to children in grade school so that black kids have role models to look up to, and the white kids can be reminded of how they should conduct themselves.

While I see what you're driving at, I disagree with your mannerism...and bias....which is clear as day throughout your post. This movie isn't just about black people, it's also about women...something you fail to mention even once. This movie is a great inspiration to not only black people, but also women...of all color. Something that must desperately be communicated in STEM fields where women and especially black women, are a minority. 

As for reminding ""white kids"" how they should conduct themselves...what the fuck does that even mean? You realize this is a period piece and while racism was certainly alive and well and back then those particular white people were products of their environment. We don't have ""colored"" restrooms and water fountains anymore...so I'm not sure what you're reminding them of? Do you think white kids are born with some form of inherent knowledge that blacks must always sit on the back of the bus?

>  reflect on their privilege/lack thereof.

How about reflecting on what these amazing individuals did and how they inspired people of all color and gender of the greatness that could be achieved. Reflecting on hard work and determination that will get you further than standing around waiting for a participation trophy. 


Overall I enjoyed the movie, however something tells me this is a case where the book is gonna be better for those extra details.

>The spark of curiosity ignited, Shetterly began researching these women. Unlike the male engineers, few of these women were acknowledged in academic publications or for their work on various projects. Even more problematic was that the careers of the West Computers were often more fleeting than those of the white men.

Many only remained at Langley for a few years.

What's harmful is that microaggressions are societies way of telling a person that they don't belong. That a girl doesn't belong in a computer science class.

Fat shaming is bad and you should not be subjected to it. Same for age discrimination. But none of the things you described are micro aggressions. Micro aggressions are kind of like death by a thousand cuts.

Not that a girl didn't smile at you.

The reason I do this is because 20% of the time they ask me for money or some other handout.  And some get pretty aggressive when they do it.  

One time a person (not to use any judgmental language here) stopped me as I was walking with the ""can I just ask you a question?""  And I responded ""If you're going to ask me for money the answer is no.""  Well, I quickly found out they were, and when I had to tell them I just said no, they got angry and called me a XYZ-ist.

1. That to simply be allowed into an environment doesn't make it welcoming. There's a reason a lot of women *drop out of* computing programs. They're graded fairly, allowed to enroll, and then constantly dismissed by their classmates and professors.

2. That women are just placing the blame for their low self esteem on men. [An excellent article on ""low self esteem""](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/how-the-rhetoric-of-imposter-syndrome-is-used-to-gaslight-women-in-tech) as you put it. Yes, there are *some* internal issues. Those are not strictly based on gender. I'm talking about attitudes that repeatedly reinforce the idea that women (and underrepresented races) aren't good at science. Things like how in *Hidden Figures* Jim Johnson made a comment about her being good at math ""for a woman"".

3. You assume that because I'm calling out that there's a problem means that I'm not ""exhibit[ing] great courage"" and actually doing something. I'm being repeatedly insulted for sharing my observations and haven't run away. I've got two degrees in computer science - including a Masters. I have won awards in computer science programs. I have been at the top of my class as a programmer. I have taught university courses. I have had good jobs as a programmer. Don't assume you know me. Don't assume you can dismiss me as ""just complaining"". I know what I am talking about.

4. I have never once claimed that I want everyone to love me. I have never said I don't expect or want any challenges in life. What I want is for those challenges to have *nothing to do with gender or race or orientation*. Growing up means realizing you have value and fighting for it. And that's what I'm doing. And you're calling me a complainer.

1. You're overlooking my point. The quid is *Why do you need to be welcoming?* *Where and who the hell told you that life must be welcoming, that no people will oppose you, that you would be liked by everyone*. And the most important *Why do you think that only if you meet no resistance at all you may be able to achieve something?*

2. I knew you were going for that route. I just put woman as a context, but it applies to everyone. I'm mixed race in a country different than America, from a city/region where people is perceived as lazy. I've been joked about hundred of times about both things. My answer has never been ""OMG I feel opressed"", ""that's discrimination"", ""that's racist"". I obviously fucking know what those things are. But one does lead and change perceptions not by making a fuzz, but by setting examples and convictions (not of the jail kind). I've worked my ass hard and still try to go further than what others do in what I'm doing. Some people still keeps dismissing me, but that's their problem because a lot of the others have seen what I can do and have vouched and allowed me to advance in my field. One can stay crying all die, depress and do shit or one can channel that into actual goals and go through hell to succeed.

3. I would like you to remind what I told you via PM. I'm not talking specifically about you as I don't know you or your life. You got masters in computing science, that's fucking great (seriously, one needs to be reason very well to figure out computation times and optimization) but don't you think if instead of spending so much time and effort in denouncing ""micro-agressions"" (things that include a lot of things that are just hostile wording, let's be honest), you went to high schools and taught other girls and boys to code? What about focusing on real agressions (e.g. survivors from rape, domestic violence, homelessness), supporting them, teaching them and getting them into your field?

4. Once again I'm not calling you anything, I was talking generally. And I also want what you want. And I also think it's worth fighting for. But right now our wishes do not change the fact that there are people (a sizable ammount) that thinks different. And we can just endlessly keep ranting over the internet about it, desensitizing and annoying a lot of people or we can just hut the hell up, put our hands to work and get tangible results.

Words are powerful, yes, but **they will never win over realities on ground**. Words are just symbols. (This is my point, specially the second and third paragraphs)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression_theory#Criticism]. I would also like to show you a article I read last month on the Foreign Affairs magazine in which a psychologists explain the rise of Trump and how this exact behaviours of shouting wolf at the top of the lungs and picking the shotgun everytime a butterfly is seen leads to radicalization.

Finally, my criticism of the movie is that they're changing historical facts to embellish a history and make the society seem more backwards relative what it really was. That's plain lying and bullshiting, appealing to feeling. Want reality?

People remember who they worked with, and discuss the teams they worked with. Ruth Harris probably didn't work directly with Katherine Johnson due to the time they worked there and what their job descriptions were.

As for Nichelle Nichols, her efforts were in recruitment. I highly doubt she would have known about Katherine specifically unless someone from NASA introduced them. Nor do I know what kind of material she used for recruitment. But recruitment is not the same as knowing *every single black woman at NASA*. No matter how important. And from everything we know about the STILL LIVING Katherine, she's a very humble woman. Not likely to go shoving her way to the forefront of a recruitment campaign.

And why she wouldn't be in ""We Could Not Fail""? Only ten people were profiled. And guess what? They were all *men*. Female computers are only recently being documented despite the workload they carried.

John Glenn? It wasn't a ""narrow escape from death"" it was a ""I don't think I trust the machines numbers, can you check that? I trust you."" His book was (quite fairly) about his achievements, risks, and challenges, not hers.

We're not just dealing with issues of race, we're dealing with issues of gender. On a large scale female human computers were not taken note of. Double that for the black female computers. The culture was to ignore them. I know this because I have read a lot of academic and historical papers on women in engineering and science. One of the reasons we're just stating to hear about these women is because **no one bothered to talk about them**. Not because their work was unimportant. It's only been in the last 15 years that people have started to realize we're going to lose their story entirely if we don't start interviewing these women to find out exactly what their jobs were.

My issue is that the current environment is hostile from a *social* perspective and specifically towards *women and under represented races*.

2. I have never said that I was being oppressed, and specifically pointed out earlier that micro-aggression are not equivalent to ""OMG THAT'S SEXIST/RACIST/HOMOPHOBIC"".

And I'm angry that even after all you've been through and struggled with that you think it was okay. That you think another young man in your town should be treated like that. And that the only valid way to succeed is through that.

3. I want to get young women into coding and computer science and *be valued*. I don't want to bring young women into a hostile work place. So I'm tackling the problem two-fold: I'm trying to encourage them to code by mentoring them, and I'm trying to make sure that the workplace is better for them than it is for me. Just like my mother's efforts and Katherine Johnsons and Dorothy Vaughn and Grace Hopper all helped make my workplace more accepting than theirs. And I will say it AGAIN: **the fact that there are worse things out there than micro-agressions does not negate the hurt cause by either**. Yes, physical assault is worse. No that does not mean small issues don't cause pain. And no, *that* does not make physical assault less serious. Jfc, how hard is that to comprehend?

And for your criticism of the movie: The movie was about 3 women. Of those three women they made one small change to Dorothy's timeline, and one exaggeration of a restroom situation (that I believe came from someone else in the group). That's it. Those three individual stories are hella accurate and well researched. They condensed side characters to streamline the narrative and remove any blame of racist behavior from individuals and place it on society as a whole.

You are making the false assumption that history is unbiased. That only the important facts are recorded at the time. But the truth is the history is written by people with opinions on what ""important"" means. If you actually *read the reports on the female computers at NASA* (you know, the accounts recorded from the *people who worked there*) you will find that what actually happened was that there was a social assumption that their work was irrelevant.

What's happening is people interested in science history are reading more of the journals, logs, and primary documents from the time. And they're finding names and people involved with the research that they hadn't paid much attention to before, because they only know the one big shiny name on the front of the paper.

And the race relations weren't flat at all. They showed many different aspects of it. Differences within how each character handled the prevalent racism. Characters who were oblivious to it. Characters who thought it shouldn't be an issue. Characters who did think it was an issue. It was never ""here's one bad person, we stop them and everyone lives happily ever after"" like so many other films.

You keep going on about how it's tweaked history to it's advantage, but isn't that the *definition* of a biopic? And again, I *read the source material*.

You're acting like this movie is rewriting NASA history. It isn't. It's expanding on a section of it we knew nothing about until recently.

And your statement is contradictory:
>I never said that all the important facts are recorded when they happen.

> Why do you insist that they're ""just as much a part of NASA's history""? If they were, it wouldn't have taken 50 years for anyone to write down even a single sentence about them.

We know that things weren't made up 50 years after the fact because people are 1. going back and checking the records of who what where and doing what. NASA records. Not just random made up facts. So we know exactly what work these women did. And 2. people are interviewing multiple primary sources. Primary sources that until recently were unexplored.

As for Glenn - he was alive but not in any shape for extensive interviews. They did their research with NASA trying to track down the exact paper trail, but couldn't pinpoint the exact date he had her re-do the numbers. It's also important to note that the mission was rescheduled multiple times do to various issues. Katherine solved *one* of of them. A major issue, but still, I don't expect him to remember every single delay and every single person involved. He did his job, she did hers.

Oral histories recorded and maintained by NASA, multiple interviews with a wide range of people, internal documents (listed with reference numbers, so if you want to go to their files and find them you can), books (including one of the two you mentioned), and newpaper articles from the time.

That is the core of the movie. That is what most of the screentime is devoted to, and that is all provably true. Ergo, the movie logically can not be false.

>2. You claim this movie is fake. That almost everything and everyone in it is false and made up.

It's not my claim, it's what the facts state.


>3. Katherine Johnson is real.

Yes she is, but Katherine Johnson is not in this movie.  They filmed a woman named Taraji Henson and said that her name was Katherine Johnson.  That is false, and nothing can be both true and false at the same time.  The movie tells a story about a fictional woman who personally saved John Glenn's life.  The real Katherine Johnson did not do that, so the movie is about a fictional character of the same name who does things that did not happen in reality.


>4. Dorothy Vaughn is real.

Yes she is, but Dorothy Vaughn is not in this movie.  They filmed a woman named Octavia Spencer and said that her name was Dorothy Vaughn.  That is false, and nothing can be both true and false at the same time.  


>5. Mary Jackson is real.

Yes she is, but Mary Jackson isn't in this movie.  They filmed a woman named Janelle Monae and said that her name was Mary Jackson.  That is false, and nothing can be both true and false at the same time.


>6. Katherine was a computer and mathematician who helped calculated the launch and landing of Freedom 7, the Apollo missions, and the Space Shuttle program.

It is true that she helped.  But the movie said she did it by herself, which is false.  Nothing can be both true and false at the same time.  This is a logical fact.  


>7. Dorothy Vaughn was the first black supervisor at NASA and a genius with the IBM.

The real Dorothy Vaughn was the first black supervisor in 1948.  The fictional character in the movie became the first black supervisor in 1962, at a fictional place called NASA that was so racist that it didn't have any black supervisors already.  That is false, and nothing can be both true and false at the same time.  


> 8. Mary was the first black female engineer at NASA.

That statement appears to be true at first - but NASA did not exist in 1951, when Mary Jackson began working at the Aeronautics program called NACA.  Since the movie mixes falsehood in, we know that it cannot be true.  Because nothing can be both true and false at the same time.  



When NASA was created in 1958, it already had black supervisors and engineers from the first day it existed.  The racist place depicted in this movie never existed in the real world.
