d3d90l2,"The movie was great all around but I was astounded by how well Holly was handled. So often trying to include a tween or young teen as an active participant in an adult oriented adventure movie rings false to me. Like, what parent would allow that? Thanks to the writing and acting not only did Holly belong, I can't imagine the movie without her. The young actresses' chemistry with Russell Crowe legitimately made me believe the threat of silent treatment was enough to make badass Healy spare a scumbag assassin's life.

EDIT: Autocorrect created the new actor Russell Crowd.",4k64eu

I laughed *so* hard. The entire film was stupidly hilarious and really, really solid. It's nice to see Shane Black do a film that calls back to his roots. ",4k64eu
d3cingc,"I firmly believe that this movie should spawn a new Oscar category just to give Ryan Gosling an award for that magical 'discovering the corpse' scene. That was pure art.

This film was absolutely excellent. Great upbeat noir feel, great music, incredible chemistry between the leads, and a spunky kid sidekick that is not only not painfully annoying, but one of the best parts of the movie.",4k64eu

The actress that played Holly was fantastic. It's nice seeing Ryan Gosling taking on these different types of roles, he played the comedy really well. His and Crowe's dynamic was hilarious and super fun to watch and stuff.",4k64eu
d3cgdw6,"One thing I really appreciated on a second viewing was how well Black sets everything up. From the actual crime elements to the great comedic moments like the ankle gun or Nixon, he knows how to weave these bits into the film and never fall victim to obvious telegraphing like he made fun of in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.

>Okay, I apologize. That is a terrible scene. It’s like, why was that in the movie? Gee do you think maybe it’ll come back later? Maybe? I hate that. It’s like the TV’s on, talking about the new power plant, hmm, wonder where the climax will happen? Or that shot of the cook in Hunt For Red October? So anyway, sorry.

Overall I really enjoyed this film. The film is as 70s retro as you can possibly get and I love it for that. LA in the 70s is a great time to set a detective story and the chemistry between the quite brute Russel and the over-the-top whiner Gosling is just perfect. I hope this makes a bit of money and Shane Black can do more cause I really enjoy this cast.

I dont remember if that quote is nearly accurate to the movie's one , but that really did the trick for me since i forgot he only saw the gun in his falling asleep behind wheel dream. 
Overall this movie isnt a masterpiece since it got setup very standard way and it is the same way troughout it. We got car accident to put the audience in the middle of the action, then we meet our protagonists, they meet each other, etc etc. NOT like it is bad, but with that said you never feel like either march or healy going to die in next scene or if the girl is Not supposed to solve criminal cases in the middle of a porn party. Or Maybe i watched too much michael mann or Game of thrones lately. 

Summing up this is really good goofy 70' criminal movie. It had a vibe of PTA's Boogie Nights, and ofc kiss kiss bang bang. I Also liked the duo, they got very good chemistry. ",4k64eu
d3cmpdx,This movie was fucking awesome and the billboard showing Tim Allen at The Comedy Store was a nice detail. Crowe's character reminded me of his character in LA Confidential.,4k64eu
d3d67s1,"The hit man ""John Boy"" was pretty funny, he looked/acted like a mix between Don Draper and Ramsey Bolton, with the addition of a Richard Thomas hockey puck mole on his face.

After the movie was over, I realized that the giant mole was the only reason they called him John Boy, due to the popularity of Little House on the Prairie's popularity. Even ol' Blue Face called him John Boy. (Blue Face was a great character too and the what lead up to his death was classic.)

I gotta go watch this again.",4k64eu

d3dvoxv,"I literally couldn't stop laughing. The opening scene cracked me up way more than it should, and I basically lost it when March tried to punch through the glass and failed.

I had a very fun time with this movie. Thoroughly enjoyed it. What concerned me though was the lack of audience. IMO Neighbours 2 cannot be funnier than this movie, and it's a shame that such a great comic cannot get a full theatre on its opening night.

If you're on the fence about this, go see it. I was 3 hours ago, but dragged myself to it and do not regret it one bit.",4k64eu

d3einoc,"I thought it was a stroke of genius that everything Crowe and Gosling did was, quite literally, for the birds.

d3dt44i,"Really good movie. Gosling is a comedic revelation. Could be the start of an excellent detective duo. Would've liked more character development for Healy and Holland, they don't grow much or cause much change. But the whole enterprise is all in good fun.",4k64eu
d3dw6xy,"Throughout the entire movie I found myself thinking that Holly (Angourie Rice) was pretty much a carbon copy of Penny from Inspector Gadget. Constantly upstaging the adults while giving off a facade of being an innocent child-And not handled in an obnoxious manner either.

That really obscure thought aside, it's a great movie. Really took me back to the buddy cop movie genre which died a while back. They executed the 70's theme excellently and a good chunk of the theater was laughing constantly. ",4k64eu
d3euuhh,"What a god damned movie. Was consistently laughing throughout the whole thing, and the story was original and fun. Hell of a flick. ",4k64eu
d3ejmmu,"Loved everything about it. It could've been a great 70s throwback gritty neo-noir movie even without the humor, or even the tight action scenes, but the witty writing and Ryan Gosling's (sometimes subtle) exceptional physical comedy (the man has such an incredible range, one of the best actors alive) and comedic timing elevate it to another level of awesomeness. Haven't seen The Revenant yet, but so far it's my movie of the year and best action comedy since the Jump Street movies, if not better. 

Also loved Russell Crowe's John Goodman thing that he had going on, and the girl that played Gosling's daughter was great too. So much fun. ",4k64eu
d3chaho,"Anyone else have theories on the significance of the Bees? Killer bees were mentioned, March hallucinates a bee and a bee showed up at the very end",4k64eu
d3easas,"Great film, and I also thought there was something very interesting going on with march in terms of his relationship with his daughter. It seemed like he was absolutely terrified of her growing up and seeing a lot more of the evils of the world, like he said disdainfully when that arrogant kid offered to expose himself, or dealing with the pornography industry, or even that he was concerned with birds and bees (the colloquial phrase about budding sexuality) and possibly losing his daughter. Shane Black has done it again with terrifically nuanced, and flawed characters.",4k64eu
d3ezz1r,"I really didn't want to see this film based on the trailer. It was just too forced. And (spoiler alert) much of what is in the trailer appears in the first five minutes or so. It just ruined what should have been surprising jokes.

Once those were out of the way, this is a messy, fun, enjoyable movie that got several laugh out loud moments for me and I'm normally pretty picky.  Yes, we've seen the buddy movie before, and many of the standard things are there and yet they are not.

I once saw Shane Black speak and the one takeaway I remember is that a movie should be nothing more than setup and payoff, setup and payoff. It's great to see that Shane practices what he preaches.

There is all the quirky dialogue and plot points and fantastical elements that are earmarks of a Shane Black film and somehow he pays it all off. He gives the audience all the little throwaway information early and then loops back to the smallest of detail later that makes watching this so enjoyable.

Nice to see Gladiator and Gosling having fun. But the real scene stealer is Angourie Rice as Gosling's daughter. She more than holds her own and (in setup and payoff) gives the film a satisfying emotional payoff in the climatic scene.

I only hope that when the inevitable sequel comes along, it will be an honest attempt to make an enjoyable movie and won't be phoning it in like the Lethal Weapon sequels.

Go see it.",4k64eu

d3chdzb,"There were a ton of really funny bits in this movie that worked and Gosling can really pull off physical comedy.  Still, for all the buddy cop/detective/noir movie tropes that Kiss Kiss Bang Bang totally flipped on their heads, this movie seemed to come back to all of them in a totally unironic conventional way, all the way down to the ""frenemies band together and start a PI firm together"" happy ending (I mean, compare that to the ending of KKBB, which literally apologizes for its cliches in a way that totally subverts them while being hilarious).  It felt like a movie that didn't realize KKBB, a movie that covers all the same ground in a smarter and more self aware way, already existed, which would be more tolerable if it weren't written and directed by the same guy.  Overall I liked it and laughed a lot but I expected more given the gold Shane gave us before.

LOVED Ryan Gosling gradually shaking like a terrified dog more and more as the elevator went down.  And the ""ankle gun""/cold coffee scene was hilarious.",4k64eu

d3czw8q,"I noticed that there was one tiny historical inaccuracy. In the scene where Amelia is laying down in March's room there are two posters next to his bed. One is ""Nevermind the Bullocks"", which makes sense (released in 1977), the other is a poster of the album cover ""London Calling"" which actually wasn't released until late 1979. Although the poster doesn't include the title ""London Calling"", the picture of the bassist was taken in September of 1979... and the movie takes place in 1978. Just thought I'd throw that out there. I loved the movie though! Fantastic!",4k64eu
d3cgwd6,"As a huge fan of noir, I LOVED Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang. This seemed like that but in the 70's so I was sold. It definitely delivered! I love Shane Black's style of ""Here is how the scene is an how it would play out in a normal cookie cutter film. How would it play out if the characters were incompetent?"" That made for some truly hilarious scenarios(ie. half of Gosling's situations) This is probably my favorite film of the year with Green Room.",4k64eu

d3dr2so,Super funny. Chemistry between the two was great. I wished they didn't show that many of the jokes in the trailer though.,4k64eu
d3eucb5,"This movie felt more or less like the film Inherent Vice wanted to be. A ""Big Sleep"" set in the hippie era with memorably off-the-wall characters. IV had more inventive and interesting cinematography, but NG had a miles better story and characters. 

I pretty much loved this movie. It was just a lot of fun.

It also felt like a writer at the peak of his powers. It's important to note this is not Aaron Sorkin or David Mamet, but Shane Black. I don't mention that as a sleight - they're just different writers. Aaron Sorkin at the peak of his powers will write about some grand or epic topic, like a US President or the invention of Facebook. Mamet will create a taut (and occasionally boring and bland) thriller. Shane Black is gonna have a lot of fun, give you crazy twists and turns, and memorable characters with memorable dialogue. You never get the sense in this movie that he's being lazy and making things easy. When March goes over the balcony and finds the dead body, it seems convenient, but really its Shane Black going, ""He needs to stumble upon a dead body, which is a genre trope I want to see here, but it has to happen in a way that works with both the character and bizarre tone of this story.""

Second of all, Ryan and Russell have the best chemistry I have seen in a long time. I don't know how to explain it, they just fit well and actually felt like they were having real conversations. Third of all, I never got bored and there was a chuckle every minute or so. I loved dead pool, but felt the movie had a joke every 5 seconds and they were trying to make it funny to much. This movie did add comedy to a lot of moments but not just through dialogue but also physical comedy. It's just fun to watch. ",4k64eu

d3cit50,"Quite possibly my favorite film of the year so far! Shane Balch hits it out if the park with yet another great noir style pulp crime film. The chemistry alone oozes off the screen between Gosling and Crowe. Right from the initial retro title card, I was enthralled in the film and was not let down at all. When  I thought about it post credits, the only thing I really thought could have improved would be Matt Bomer's rather bland antagonist? But by Odin's Beard was the film and 70s LA GLORIOUS! Terrific soundtrack, style, and overall vibe to the whole film.  

I certainly paid $20 to see this and didn't get ripped off by Nixon showing up!

Crowe and Gosling were great, and there were a lot of hilarious one liners, but some of the tone shifts had me thinking the movie didn't know what it wanted to be. The Detroit conspiracy felt rushed and we were told about these mobsters that were supposedly moving in but I don't think we ever saw them. It just felt disjointed to me. If a 5 out of 10 is a middle of the road score, I'd give this a 5.5. ",4k64eu

d5z5d76,"I just saw this last night and I knew *nothing* going in. I hadn't ever seen a trailer, I've never seen KKBB and I'm not a groupie for Gosling

So, yeah. I knew nothing.

I was SO HAPPY like, 20 minutes into the movie. I was ecstatic. It's been a long time since I was *this* enchanted by a movie. I had no idea what to expect. What is this? An action movie? A funny movie? A sweet fuckin' noir flick? Oh, ok it's all of those things? 

I will admit, when I saw the 70's-style shit I got immediately skeptical. I feel like that cliche has nearly worn out its welcome. I had no idea if this movie was just gonna make me mad, and at the inclusion of a kid character I was a little apprehensive...but they pulled it off. I couldn't believe it. Every joke and gag was executed well (well, except one part...) imho.

Ok, now my single complaint, and it's a small one - 

Towards the end of the movie where Holly says, ""I need a drink,""

Like, really!? That was so fuckin' corny, like something Bud would say on Married With Children. She was *not* a prop in that movie. Her character had legs and she wasn't just an edgy kid for the sake of being an edgy kid. That part made me roll my eyes.

The rest of it was great. Bravo.",4k64eu
d3dq3ka,"Not to be *that* guy, but I hated it. Like really, really hated it. One of my biggest pet peeves in movies is coincidences and as the plot progressed there was one after another.  I also felt that the more involved the daughter became in the plot the more annoying she became on screen, culminating in the whole, ""If you kill him, i'll never talk to you again..."" moment. Schlock, all schlock.

So the kid in the very beginning just so happens to be staring at a picture of Misty the moment her car comes barreling through his home? C'mon. So Gosling accidentally crashes his car to just get back in enough time to stop the bad guy from killing his daughter? Yeah right. And, for that matter, why did Jon Boy hesitate at all in killing Amelia? He had her asleep and completely vulnerable, why throw the kid out the window and go for a gun? Why even talk to the kids at all when you're already in the house and you know you're target is in the next room? They set him up to be this badass assassin the previous scene only for him to be an idiot later on.

Also, I loved the scene towards the beginning where Gosling cuts his hand while trying to break in. Genius, and incredibly funny. But how come later on people are crashing through glass nonstop, him included, and there isn't an ounce of blood? He literally flies through multiple windows towards the end and walks it off like it's nothing.

There were far too many scenes of them stumbling mindlessly upon crucial plot points. Like, they'll be driving around and one of them will say ""Stop! What's that?"" And it's a billboard of porn producer Sid they're looking for, or it's the exact hotel that Amelia just so happened to be having a meeting in that night. Or Ryan Gosling will fly backwards off a balcony to stumble exactly upon Amelia and a dead body. Or they'll just so happen to find a note corresponding to a car show that very night just in time for them to stop it. It was just bad.

I did enjoy the dialogue however, and I felt that Gosling and Crowe absolutely killed it. The more the plot wore on however, the more everything began to fall apart. Strong characters, terribly weak story.

d3dre80,I was surprised that I didn't really care for it.  It felt a little... flat I guess?  I liked things about it but nothing really grabbed me.,4k64eu

d3cili8,I was surprised by how the whole movie wasn't spoiled in the trailer like I thought it was. Plenty of great scenes not in the trailers and the overall plot had more to it than I expected. ,4k64eu
d3cp0vg,"great one liners, great chemistry, great physical comedy. loved it",4k64eu
d3f0mdv,"Compared to so many of the movies with forced jokes every second and special effects worth billions coming out of their bum, this was a unique buddy cop type film, with an actually interesting plot married to very good comedy action sequences. 

Plus there were topless women, probably more boobs in this film than the Neighbors Sorority movie. That's never a bad thing. Too bad some of the hottest women died.

**From bumblebees to cowboys falling off balconies**, the movie hit a ton of funny gags that I really hope more people get the chance to see. Parts of the movie tasted the reefer madness lol and others were very good parodies of action film cliches. 

When Gosling said ""I think i'm immortal"" in an awed voice seconds after Crowe deadpanned ""Did you fall off the roof again?,"" it also reminded me what made this movie uniquely special: the relationship between two protagonists. Most movies don't manage this. 

When that kid Angourie threw useless cold coffee at the evil agent Gosling had fallen for, which seconds later leads to a reminder on the stupidity of high heels, I laughed at how bumbling but unpredictably lucky the heroes were. 

The only problem I had with the movie was a bit too much violence for my taste and the partly downer ending. I was so happy that Gosling, Crowe and Angourie were happy and having a blast in their bar spot, but I don't see why it's considered necessary for non-superhero movies to almost always emphasize how nothing ever changes in a bad, corrupt world. This is at the end of the day a comedy movie meant to make us feel good, not a political expose meant to leave a bad taste in our political awareness). 

Still, overall, great popcorn flick.",4k64eu

I am definitely guilty of overly high expectations (the trailer was brilliant) and there were come very funny parts but overall it just felt very...meh.  

Did it not bother anybody else that the entire plot was completely strung along on a series of highly improbable (but very convenient) coincidences?  I guess you could argue that was kind of the whole point but I was expecting for a bit more of a darker more serious plot with comedy interspersed (a la Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) but oh well.

d3efy1c,"I mean it was OK but I think wasn't blown away by it, nor would I pay to watch it again. I JUST watched kiss kiss bang bang 2 days ago so I noticed a lot of similarities immediately - which probably made this one a lot less fresh to me.",4k64eu
d3e3rrn,"I think I am in the minority with my opinion on this movie, but I thought this movie was just ok. I felt like 90% of the jokes that were in the movie, were shown in the trailer. I also felt like I was watching a rehash of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (which I love), but I was hoping for something a little more refreshing. I know Shane Black's thing is the buddy cop movie, but too many times I thinking, that exact gag was done in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. For example, the dead body getting tossed over the fence and landing in a ridiculous way was the same way the body they toss out of the window in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang landed halfway in the dumpster. I will admit there was some dude relatively close to me laughing at every little thing in the happened, even things that were not even funny and continuously providing his own commentary at random times and I felt like that did take me out of the experience. Had a difficult time following the plot at points because he kept stealing my attention away from what was going on in the movie.",4k64eu

d3h7ftq,"I enjoyed the movie and there were a few scenes where I definitely laughed out loud but this movie definitely seems to be getting over hyped to me. Crowe and Gosling are so good together but everything they do gets hampered by the fucking daughter character. Seriously she is in the entire movie and its obvious immediately that she is going to crack the entire case wide open over and over again for them.

I also didn't mind Amelia getting killed. In fact it was a pleasant surprise when it happened. When she jumped out the window I groaned, like ""they are going to have to find her again?"" I wanted to see Crowe or Gosling slap her when she explained what was really going on. Have one of them go ""we are getting fucking shot at over smog?!""

Do they explain why he was ""dreaming""?",4k64eu
d3dudd3,"I enjoyed the hell out of this movie! The characters were fun and interesting, the plot was a cool mix of California noir and buddy cop and it thrilled and entertained in equal measure.

Shane Black also proves his writer/director chops yet again by weaving together this great tale, I had a grin on my face for most of the movie. 

Some things were rushed (ie John Boy, the ending in a way) but the chemistry between Crowe and Gosling, commitment to genre and period, as well as a strong blast of energy helps smooth out any imperfection. ",4k64eu

- We got team of two with additional third one (Lebowski+Walter,Donny/ Jackson+Holland,Holly)

- Similiar names of Donny and Holly

- Chilled, not so bright one (Lebowski/Holland)

- Sometimes violent, big, confident about himself (Jackson/Walter)

- Marginalized friend/child (Donny/Holly)

- Swapping the money in a bag

- porn industry :)

- ""artistic experiment"" that involves sexuality (vaginal art/porn for attention)

d3cj4gq,"Well they are introduced three time I think? Firstly at the Earth Wind and Fire concert party in the hills, as Holl is getting a drink. ""You know what they say about killer bees? They kill"". 

Secondly, when Holl is dreaming behind the wheel, under the influence of alcohol. 

And thirdly, at the very end, on the bar table as the duo drink to their somewhat success. 

You could argue that it is tied to the theme of the alcoholism that Holl predominantly has (even though they're both alcoholics). Everytime Holl gets drunk, the killer bee is there to sting him and remind him of reality.",4k64eu
d560x76,"i think the theme of this movie is the stubbornness of old polluting industries and their unwillingness to change? Bees are going massively into extinction as a result of pollution, and are a symbol for victims of climate change.

The last scene is a subtle joke, at least in my interpretation, when Gossling, after the whole struggle to get the tape to get that lady in jail, tries to kill a bee. ",4k64eu

Afterwards, they introduce the two characters. Jackson (Crowe) is a ""messenger"" and beats up a guy whose preying on a girl much younger then him. (I think she was 12 and he was 25?

Jackson takes up a job from Amelia to beat up Holland for following her. She writes his address on a pink cow sticky note and Jackson drives on over.

It's funny that I had the same thought about the glass when Gosling landed on top of the car after falling through glass.  His face is literally on glass shards and he *slides* off the car.  That would fucking slice you to ribbons.  Most movies it doesn't bother you, but because they had previously made a point of him getting injured on glass, it slammed into my mind every time it happened.  That does suck.  Stumbling on the billboard (which porn producers had billboards? I know it was seventies, so maybe, but seems pretty dumb), the hotel, and the girl literally jumping on top of their car were all kind of dumb.  The dream sequence with the fly was really bad other than it leading to the pretty funny Ankle Gun gag later in the hotel.  Gosling and Crowe as characters kept it enjoyable for me.  Gosling in particular was really incredible.  I want to know so much more about that guy.  I want to know what the fuck happened to him to make him this way (and not just being depressed about his wife.  I mean where did this fucking idiot genius come from?).  I want to know how he even got a wife in the first place and what kind of father he was before she died.  I want to know everything.  That's pretty good.

Judith Kuttner, the head of the Justice Department, at the end of the film, says that, ""Detroit killed my daughter."" which she meant as a metaphor, as if the corruption and overall seedy nature of the city finally caught up to her and killed Amelia.

Later in the film when Kim Basinger's character looked right into the camera and said, ""If' I'm not there to fix Detroit, someone will be"" they cut to The Comedy Store sign again, but this time it only says Richard Lewis, Robert Klein and Elaine Boosler. No Tim Allen who is not only from Detroit originally, of course, went on to eventually star in Home Improvement where he played a Detroit based 'Mr. Fix-It'

So I saw that set up at the beginning, and the pay off at the end of being not only very typical of the detail Shane Black puts into his films, but also a nod to Tim Allen himself.",4k64eu

To Amelia, the whole catalytic converter issue with the automakers is a very black and white issue.

Considering that one of the main themes is the relativity of morality, I think it's very possible that the circumstances surrounding automobile issue were relative.

Her thought process is probably something like:
`catalytic converter breaks rules -> environment damage -> bad`

In reality, the reality might be a little more grey.  We never see the actual evidence that was gathered against the Big Three, plus you have to remember that Detroit's main industry is the automobile industry.  By crushing the industry with the iron fist of the Justice Department, the local economy might have never recovered.

Bad guys almost never got away with their crimes in traditional film noir, either falling to the heroes, a police shootout or chronic villain backstabbing disorder.

The joke is due to the juxtaposition of how one man went against orders to spare a man, and the person he saved followed orders in order to further commit atrocities. 

But, again, it was a joke. It didn't have to do with Rommel's obscurity. I didn't type it to show useless and inapplicable knowledge. I did it for giggles.",4k64eu

d3fajyp,"Yeah, it definitely is obvious, I'm just saying, I think Russel was actually drinking in that scene. ",4k64eu
d3dwukr,"It seems that one of the main points of the movie was to show that morality is relative.  When you're fighting a guy for your life and you get the upper hand, of course no one would blame you for killing him.  I mean, he tried to kill you after all.

However, to the 3rd party observer that didn't see the brawl, it looks like you're choking out a dude that is very clearly defeated.

This is the same thing with the whole catalytic converter issue.  My roommate disagrees with me, but I have a suspicion that they never show the ""evidence"" fully for a purpose.  This is because the issue is not as black and white as Amelia thinks it is.  To her, her mom is evil because she's part of capitalist America and letting the automakers have their way with the environmental regulations.

On the other hand, one should consider what would happen if the Big Three had the book thrown at them.  Detroit's main industry is the automotive industry.  A total collapse of some of the largest corporations in the city could have devastating effects on the local economy.

Also, think about the title.  The two main characters are pretty nice compared to some of the scum they encounter in their adventures, but, are they *really* nice?  It's hard to say because it depends on where you're looking at them from.",4k64eu

Me and my nephew (he's 24, I'm 36) watch movies now and then, I've taken it upon me to finish his '70s/'80s training (Predator, Highlander, Blade Runner, Terminator, Conan, Harry and Maude) and I never feel awkward seeing people boning then (all above except Predator contain advanced pipelaying), because my nephew is one of my mates now.",4k64eu

d826huw,"Oh hey, a reply to my 4 month old comment!

Honestly, I think this whole movie was very refreshing and totally underrated.  It broke a lot of the common tropes that you see in these types of movies and it did so in a way that actually made sense.
