e3ioz44,"I teared up when Kayla asked her dad if he was sad to have her as his daughter. I definitely remember feeling like that as a kid, so for her to put the notion out there and for him to reassure her that he makes her so *so* happy was very cathartic for me.",945h35

She thinks Olivia would find her less cool because she ""chickened out of"" ""doing stuff"" with a boy for the first time, when in reality Kayla trusted her gut, and did the right thing. Plus Olivia would have kicked that dude's ass for what he did. Olivia was the absolute best person to tell about it, and it was in Riley's best interest for her not to find out.

e3rsi6r,"There's been a lot of talk about how accurately the film portrays that age and modern teenage life, but I haven't heard anyone talk about what I believe to be the actual theme of the movie. Even more than awkwardness, I believe what Burnham is trying to convey is empathy. 

I'm not a girl in her early teens; I don't even *know* any girls in their early teens. Still, this movie made me really care for Kayla and her problems in a way that most movies don't. Suspension of disbelief lets us identify with the protagonist, but usually this is in service to the plot. In Eighth Grade, the plot itself seems to be a vehicle to bring us closer to Kayla. It's also emphasized several times that one of Kayla's strengths is her empathy for the people around her, and we see this play out in her interactions with Gabe (the nerdy boy) and even Riley in the mall. Furthermore, it's usually the other character's *lack* of empathy that makes them ""villainous"": the boys seeing Kayla only as a sex object and the popular girls not seeing her at all (literally). Olivia is cool not because she's popular but because she reaches out to Kayla, sees what she's going through and tries to help.

I believe what Bo is trying to do is instill a sense of empathy in us, the audience. And I *think* the intent is for it not just to be for Kayla during the movie, but hopefully to train us to be more empathetic in our own lives. I have to admit I'm biased in favor of that effort myself, so I may be reading too much into it there, but it wouldn't be that far out of line with other things Bo has done. His works often have a moral of sorts. And certainly Eighth Grade has made me want to care more about other people even if their problems are different than mine.",945h35

e3igbfn,"This was fantastic. Let's give Bo another directing gig soon, ya?

The 'Truth or Dare' scene was the most uncomfortable scene in a movie this year, by far. I loved it. The pool scene & end dinner scene were highlights. I laughed so goddamn hard during the banana sequence. ""I'm pretty sure I made a note somewhere that you hate bananas"" might as well be the best-delivered line in the history of cinema. I love that the father-of-the-year keeps taking beatings but he just never goes down. Really wholesome stuff in this, mixed in with some insanely cringy self-relflection moments that make you almost want to cry about your own middle school experience. Elsie Fisher could easily be up for awards if this wasn't released in July. Gabe was awesome.

Although I did think it missed a 'punch', that something like *Lady Bird* & *Call Me By Your Name* have.The campfire Father/Daughter talk scene went for it but didn't quite get there in my opinion, even though I really wanted it do. There was definitely a Michael Stuhlbarg-like presence/performance needed for that scene to break through.

Best directorial debut of the year by a mile. Elsie Fisher is the breakout star of the summer, insane performance. Every second felt real. Felt more like a documentary than a movie at times. I love that they kept her dialogue real, like her lines were actually written by her, and not by Academy-award winning screenwriter or something. Some coming-of-age films are almost Sorkin-like, no teenager would ever talk like that. That feels like a weird compliment but it's true. I can see myself going to watch this again next week. Best coming-of-age film since *Lady Bird*. Bo deserves a lot of praise.",945h35
e3k7efa,"One thing I wanted to talk about in 8th grade I just remembered
The popular girls mom goes out of her way to be nice to kayla and invites her to the party
And she starts with ""oh your dad was so great tell him I say hi""
Then she ends with ""ok hope to see you tomorrow, and make sure you tell your dad I say thanks!""
And I was like ""alright a little weird that the popular girls mom would do that, but nothing like overtly weird,  I'm just being cynical""

Then in I think the best example of ""show dont tell"" when kayla gets to the party we hear her video voice over, so we dont really hear the sounds of her entering 
But the popular girls mom goes ""where's your dad?"" And looks around and says I think mabye two more times ""where's your dad??""
And I was like ""oh I get it now. Shes divorced and has a crush. That's sweet, but still not really accurate to a popular girls mom""

And THEN
We hear offscreen
The popular girls dad say ""its cake time ""
And the mom said ""no not yet""
And he says ""I got up at 8 in the goddamn morning, eat the goddamn cake""


And then it all clicked and made 100% sense to me",945h35
e3t4qr2,"I loved this movie, but honestly, it also really hurt. It‚Äôs been a decade since I‚Äôve been in Kayla‚Äôs shoes, but watching the film brought all those feelings back ‚Äî the loneliness, the insecurities, the desire to be liked by your peers, despite the feeling that, deep down, you don‚Äôt even like yourself. Welcome to middle school.

One scene that really got me was when Kayla was talking to her dad while she burned her ‚Äúhopes and dreams‚Äù and she asked him, ‚ÄúDo I make you sad?‚Äù As she went on to explain why having a daughter like her would make HER sad, I lost it. I seriously just started bawling in the middle of the theater.

There have been so many times in my life that I‚Äôve worried about having a child like myself, not because I wouldn‚Äôt love them, but because I‚Äôm worried they wouldn‚Äôt love themselves. Like how I didn‚Äôt love myself at that age. Like how Kayla didn‚Äôt, either. I‚Äôve always been so afraid that the world would make my child feel as small as it always made me feel, and that my efforts would be as useless as my parents‚Äô were for me. Watching that scene made me want to go back in time and hug my 14-year-old self, to give her that same wonderful speech Kayla‚Äôs father gave to her, something I think I needed to hear back then. I didn‚Äôt deserve the amount of self-loathing I grappled with. I didn‚Äôt deserve to feel so worthless. I just didn‚Äôt understand that back then and, unlike Kayla, I wouldn‚Äôt learn for a long, long time.

And that‚Äôs what I loved so much about this movie ‚Äî that it not only makes you feel empathy for Kayla, but for yourself. At least, that‚Äôs what it did for me. And I hope it will do the same for every young girl and boy who watches it as well. Maybe we all just need the reminder that we deserve it.

e3jb5ny,"I saw this at Alamo with a livestream QA of Bo & cast. 

Bo said the difference between Elsie and everyone else they saw was so significant that he said the movie shouldn't have even been greenlit without having her first. She was perfect. 

Josh Hamilton plays the single dad. This may be the best portrayal of a father ever in a movie. I think at some point Bo may have considered playing the part, but that his youthfulness (among other things) stopped him. I also think he may not have intended for him to be single, but that having two parents in the script would on a meta-narrative level make people feel less for one parent than the other and so less overall for the parents. With only one family member for her to interact with, the emotional resonance is better in seeing their developing relationship. It also means he is more sympathetic, and I think plenty of people who watch this movie will varyingly consciously insert themselves as her dad (I did) and so amplify their empathy and appreciation of it all. 

There's an incredible smash cut in the movie that I won't even describe because I wouldn't want anyone to have it spoiled. 

The car was scary and saddening and I thought the resolution of it up to her dad going straight into her room(and the single take of this sequence) felt like it matched the overall tempo perfectly, like knowing your panic is gone and beginning to feel better but still feeling the pain of having been so panicked. 

Bo described his intention for the score to be ‚Äúforeground music,‚Äù and Anna Meredith realized that intent brilliantly. 

At this point Bo seems to have succeeded at everything he has ever wanted to do, so I am curious if he will stay with directing or decide to climb some other mountain.

e3js3vc,"Can we come up with a list of what was in her updated time capsule? I saw:

* A picture of her and her dad

e4pci6r,"I like the idea that Riley is a grown-up version of Aidan. Mysteriously cute and kind of charming, but also a massive fuckwad. After the backseat scene, I noticed that Kayla's interest in Aidan went away.",945h35
e3ih41e,"One thing I really appreciate about this movie was how un-stylized it was.

The color scheme is just pretty natural.  Theres no fancy lighting or self indulgent shots.  The dialogue is very genuine.  It's not afraid of the natural ""um""s and ""like""s of everyday speech.  The humor is real, dumb teen humor.  The characters all look like normal people.  The dad isn't some wise Oracle.  Hes just a guy doing the best he can.  It really feels like we're getting a little cross section of a real person's life.  

This is probably one of the best examples of a ""slice of life"" film.  It's definitely not a lot like Lady Bird, but it's in the same ballpark.

Overall, a very solid and charming coming of age story.  Especially impressive considering it was Bo Burnham's directorial debut. ",945h35
e3ig281,Bo Burnham did an incredible job of making this a truly honest coming-of-age film. You can tell he really researched what is like to be an eighth grader in our current society.,945h35
e3ihj7x,"Was anyone else afraid that it was going to end with Kayla not being able to regain any sense of self-worth after that truth or dare scene? This film easily could have ended with a dark and gut-wrenching message about sexual assault. Thank goodness there was someone like Gabe who she could lean on to help rebuild herself after that trauma.

Also, it's clear based on his past work (especially what. and Make Happy) just how much of himself Bo put into Kayla's character, with the mismatch of what she's stating in her videos with how she actually acts in real life and even using those videos as a pep talk to herself.",945h35
e3iispu,"Please go see this beautiful, amazing movie. It might be the best movie you see all year. I can't recommend it enough.

It's so rare to feel such a connection to a character. I was *so* nervous and anxious for Kayla whenever anything happened. When she was waiting for her high school mentor, I was so worried that she wouldn't show up or she'd be mean or whatever. It was *such* a relief when she was nice and kind and friendly to Kayla.

I also believe this movie contains the only know instance of a person becoming more likable after quoting Rick and Morty.",945h35

e4o0cbz,I really loved the scene where the kid born in 2000 was making fun of the kid born in 2004 for being too tech-y. It‚Äôs basically like when old millennials hate on new millennials for being introduced to technology at a younger age. It‚Äôs so stupid. ,945h35
e3j21s6,"I think my favorite part was when Kayla finally spoke her mind to the popular girls on graduation day but she still didn't quite have the confidence to look them in the eyes. That was the most realistic and personal scene to me, just getting so pent up that you finally start shit talking but you're not at all used to it because you try to be a nice person so just look away while you do it. That's me x10000. 

I loved that the movie showed that approaching your fears doesn't mean the fear goes away. That just nails down anxiety, whether you're in 8th grade or college or retired. Obviously so much thanks to Bo but I have so much gratitude as well to A24 for providing the freedom to filmmakers over the last few years to create such meaningful content. *Eighth Grade*, *Lady Bird*, *Good Time*, and *The Florida Project* have connected with me so personally and are each in my Top 5 favorites of 2017 and 2018 respectively.",945h35
e3mihjc,Am I the only one a little upset at the missed opportunity to not show at least the thumbnail of the grapefruit video when she was looking for tutorials on blowjobs?,945h35
e3nrld5,"I swear it feels as if Burnham was watching ‚ÄúDiary of a Wimpy Kid‚Äù one day and said, ‚ÄúWhat the hell? This isn‚Äôt what middle school was like!!‚Äù Whereas other filmmakers would diminish the realities of middle school by pandering to a younger demographic, Burnham grounds the entire story in reality. He isn‚Äôt hyperbolic with his characters, but he perfectly portrays character types that we‚Äôve all known in middle school. The way his characters talk to each other is real and akin to people that we‚Äôve most likely encountered in our lives.

Watching Kayla‚Äôs struggle to interact with others and the built up social anxieties she would face reminded me so much of myself back in middle school. Even some of the pauses in her dialogue in which she repeatedly stutters by saying ‚Äúlike‚Äù and ‚Äúum‚Äù are reminiscent of how I used to carry myself during that time to an extent that some of those even carried on to this day (mostly the stuttering part). 

I‚Äôm just going to come out and say it: comedians are the most innovative and creative minds working in the film industry today. You got your studio filmmakers who make huge spectacles that are valuably entertaining, but comedians know how to tell stories, and not just in the genre you would expect them to dive into. From Tina Fey‚Äôs ‚ÄúMean Girls‚Äù to Kumail Nanjiani/Emily Gordon‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Big Sick‚Äù to Jordan Peele‚Äôs ‚ÄúGet Out‚Äù to now Bo Burnham‚Äôs (WHO WAS IN ‚ÄúTHE BIG SICK‚Äù) ‚ÄúEighth Grade‚Äù, you have a wide variety of excellent features that tell amazing and heartfelt stories, whether they be comedy or horror or any other genre. I blame Mel Brooks for all of this. Mel Brooks started this comedian-being-amazing-filmmakers trend and now it is in its renaissance. Please, comedians... Please write and direct your stories because they‚Äôre much more impactful than the roles they give you in Hollywood sometimes.

Than i realized, ""oh shit, that's how she feels"".  Not a lot of movies that can effectively put you in someone elses shoes.  Im a 45 yo guy, so making me empathize with a digital, image obsessed eighth grader is a pretty impressive feat.",945h35
e3jfbue,"I think a good detail to take note of is how when Kayla does her videos, she tends to do that stereotypical teenager speech thing where they always say ""like"" alot. The ""likes"" got more consistent and frequent the closer to the climax of the film (truth or dare scene), but by the end, when Kayla is finally feeling confident with herself and lacking the anxiety that characterized her for the entire movie, she only said it once in the entire video. She made her message to herself without any anxiety, with confidence and assurance.",945h35
e7yjafv,"I know I'm late but I just had to talk about this. I'm 18 now but when I was Kayla's age (I'm in the UK so I'm assuming she's about 14?) I was so, so like her. I was extremely ""quiet"", painfully shy, riddled with acne and just as friendless. I also dealt with pretty severe social anxiety (which I still do to this day, but I'm much better at coping with it) and panic attacks, so seeing her panic attack portrayed at the pool scene was fantastic, as well as her pacing around during the phone call, etc etc.

Her relationship with her dad was also something I really identified with; during the 'eighth grade' period of my life I was extremely unhappy, lonely and self-conscious, and while I had always had a great connection with both my parents, arguably more so than most, during the 12-15 period of my life I could be really mean to them. I wouldn't ""act out"" like going to parties or doing drugs etc because I *couldn't* (no social life!), but I would get home and go straight on my computer, read my book all dinner time without talking to them, be constantly irritable and snap at them really easily, and looking back on it now it breaks my heart that I treated them, although not regularly, like that, because they must have felt terrible. But I know I did this because I hated how 'useless' and ""quiet"" and friendless I was, I hated how I couldn't be a normal teenage daughter for them and had brought them so much stress and upset and disappointment that it was better for them to be mad at me than concerned. Her dad's speech towards the end made me bawl.

The car scene was also extremely upsetting. I have been that girl in the backseat. Many of us have. I was young and lonely and anxious and desperate to be liked and accepted by others, and I was in a situation where an 18-year-old boy like Riley pressured and manipulated 14-year-old me to do things I just wasn't at all ready for or at all comfortable with. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to bring myself to say no like Kayla, or at least I wasn't able to make sure this no was respected and heard, but simply apologise and cry for not being more ""mature"" and ""normal."" That scene made me sick to my stomach and was so well done.

I know I've gone off on a personal rant here but that film really affected me. It wasn't visually the most creative film I've ever seen but it was incredibly well written and acted. Props to Bo and Elsie. I've tried so hard to forget 14-year-old me and am much happier as 18-year-old me (it does get better!), but this film almost sort of allowed me to put my heartache and pain from that truly awful time to rest.",945h35

The one thing that sticks out is that it doesn't fall into the typical tropes that you would expect it too - Bo keeps it real.

Side note - this is the first time an audience in the theater actually added to the movie for me. There was a group of kids in the row behind me, each looking between 5th and 9th grade, and the way they acted coincided with how the kids in the movie acted which only validated for me.

Or every time they showed her following a conversation and she's saying ""yeah"" or ""cool"" but you can't hear her, just see her mouthing it.

So many times she's finally talking in a social situation and you get all excited but then it was just ""oh like that's cool"". Like you want to yell at the screen SAY SOMETHING WITH SUBSTANCE!! But it's so accurate, we're just not used to seeing that kind of honesty in a film.

It was all so accurate and I've never wanted to hug a movie character more in my life. I also had a rough time in middle school and put a lot of YouTube videos out there (versa 2007) so there's that.",945h35

 I almost forgot I was watching a movie because it felt so similar to my life when I was that age. The scene where Kayla‚Äôs at the pool party made me feel like having an anxiety attack. I forgot how vulnerable you feel at that age and how everything is all about how to be cool. 


And the scene at the mall!!!
I swear everyone‚Äôs felt that way. You‚Äôre hanging out with a new group of potential friends and you only know one person so you don‚Äôt know what to say or how to react or when it‚Äôs okay to jump in. They got that awkward part down perfectly.

e3tycsj,"This movie is almost like a period-piece about this modern period. Even in five years, this movie will be technologically dated (instagram layouts and stories) so it's so specific to this time. But the most important thing is that the movie focuses more on the feeling of being that age, more aided by modern culture. 

It's been about 12 years since I was in eighth grade, and it seems like middle school has changed so much.  Are active shooter drills super common and normalized? I feel like that's necessary, but still bizarre. Are schools totally relaxed on cell phone use? Every kid had their phones out in school the whole time and were so blaze about it. In high school, we used our phones, but it was always so secretive. Also, I don't remember teachers trying to keep up with kids' lingo or anything, like how the teachers were dabbing and saying ""lit."" However, I was still able to relate to parts since it really captured that feeling of being young. 

There is so much to talk about with this movie. I really like the camera work and how it really makes you focus on certain things. Like when Kayla is talking to that popular girls mom but the mom is out of focus in the background. Lots of cool stuff like that.",945h35

Just felt this character was more relatable, I guess and seemed more true to real life than lady bird.

e3q5ufh,"A lot of people have remarked about how uncomfortable and horrifying the backseat scene was, but I was almost just as disturbed by the issue of requests for/trading nude photos, for a few reasons. For someone at that age it might seem like a harmless way to show intimacy or whatever, but once that stuff is out there it becomes not at all a matter of intimacy or gratification but a lever of power that someone can use to control you. It's hard to know Aiden's intentions there, but what could be a positive relationship can quickly turn.

Suddenly having sent the photos to someone could result in public humiliation, bullying, blackmail, or all of the above. Additionally, this being children we're talking about, there have been documented instances where people involved have been prosecuted(!) for sex crimes(!) and permanently place on the sex offender registry(!) for sending and/or receiving such photos.

All in all, a bad and scary idea and it's disturbing the extent to which that has become part of the culture. In the movie the characters don't even treat it like it's a big deal.",945h35

It felt real, in the sense that the events were unfolding as they took place. Every conversation and person speaking felt genuine - there were the ums and likes, the stutters and pauses as opposed to anything else.

e3ylu4v,"Cinematography is something I've fallen in love with, and I love to see it done well, and I think this movie is an achievement in cinematography.

Did anyone notice the amount of long takes in this? The opening monologue is one cut, the majority of the dinner scene, the cut of her rolling up to the party, the cut of her walking into the backyard and getting into the pool, and the cut of her running into the house and up the stairs after the car scene. The way the camera just sits there stagnant at times, like in the mall the cuts just hang there. The way the actors were able to keep the uncomfortable pacing, and to see Kayla mouthing what she wanted to say but was afraid to speak up or even know how to inject herself into a conversation really stuck with me.

There's very little shot/reverse shot, and the times I noticed it were important. The campfire scene is one of them, we see then problem from both Kayla and her dad's perspective. She's finally being honest with her dad and herself and we the audience get to see it from both perspectives. 

The entire scene in the car is multiple cuts, but the camera location doesn't move. It's always from Kayla's point of view. Riley says something and the camera is from behind the driver's seat. Then it cuts to a close up of Kayla's face and the camera is still from behind the driver's seat. Bo's trapped us in the car with this situation happening to us, we never view this scene from the other side of the car, and the audience can only look on and hope Kayla makes it.

The script and acting were top notch, but I think a nod to Andrew Wehde's cinematography with Bo's directing is very well deserved.",945h35
e4dewag,"What I loved the most about this movie was the father/daughter relationship. Sure, throughout the movie, we see Kayla zoning out her dad or ignoring him but they are both mirrors of each other. I have a feeling when Kayla becomes a parent, she will be just like her dad. Just like how her dad was probably just like her at that age. And that scene by the fire was beautiful in how her dad tells her that he will always love her no matter what and that he's happy to be her father despite everything. That part made me cry.

e87re1q,"Former bully here.  Wish I would have seen this movie back when I was around this age or in high school.  The way I acted would probably be seen as too unbelievable to put in this movie as the popular kids had more just apathy towards her...while to some kids I was relentlessly evil.  Even to girls I was a dick, but thinking what I would have done to that Gabe kid made me fucking sick to my stomach.  This should be required viewing for everyone in middle school.  This was like watching a horror film for someone like me to really come to terms with some of the things that I did to people and how they must have felt. I was a happy kid, a bunch of really close friends,  not abused, fairly wealthy (not bill gates, but got a new Lexus when I turned 16 etc..), good athlete with near perfect test scores, not a deeply closeted homosexual or anything, just bullied to bully I guess.  Now I am a grown man watching this and wanted to cry thinking about the stuff I did and how it probably affected people.  

&#x200B;

My critiques and they arent big ones but I assumed all the kids in my high school at least had some friends.  I felt she would have fit into some group or something.  I also felt the lack of a mother was a big deal and should have played more of a role rather than one line from her dad, ""When your mother left I was scared..."" I really thought this was a perfect movie.  I remember watching The Breakfast Club in the 8th grade in Health Class and not relating to that movie really at all.

It‚Äôs more like a horror movie on what it‚Äôs like to be too ill-equipped to deal with a world that expects too much out of you. Don‚Äôt watch this with the expectation of being entertained. It‚Äôs an hour and a half of cringe-worthy moments that hopefully make you feel more sympathy for our youth who are starting to learn how to be adults.

The first time I saw the movie, I was alone in the theater for an early afternoon showing. This time however, there were a few older people in the theater with me.

I was in 6th or 7th grade when Facebook came out and I remember everyone jumping to use it. Subsequently I remember Instagram and Snapchat becoming big. Me and my friends had a similar conversation the teens did about Kayla‚Äôs generation growing up with that stuff and how it has them ‚Äúwired‚Äù differently. Idk what point is trying to make, I just thought Bo worked it in greatly. 

Along with that, I related so much to Kayla. While I had a different personality and problems, i remember being in situations like the pool party.

e3ra4xf,"The scene with no audio with Kayla and her dad after the truth/dare scene. Part of Bo's brilliance is we don't hear what is said and it's up to us to determine whether or not she told her dad about the incident or if she didn't and he pried it out of her as some dads can do. It certainly is interesting to think that she shared with her father the incident details since a few scenes later the bond of an already strong relationship get's solidified when she asks him if he'd like to share the hopes/dreams burn moment with her. What do people think, how much did she share with her dad about the attempted assault?

e3igzmc,"Movie had me cringing, laughing out loud (this might be the first movie in about 48 movies I've seen this year that actually made me laugh out loud), super creeped out in the car scene, and then back to laughing at the end play date. I think the fact that I'm laughing by the end instead of cringing during the awkward dinner scene at the end had to do with the movie taking me on  a journey with the character, who went from being uncomfortable to being at ease with someone around her own age.

Also like the use of the vlogs to tells the story and the soundtrack. Pretty delightful film and definitely worth watching.
",945h35
e3p9syw,"One of the most grounded and realistic depiction of the 8th Grade. First thing first, I like that the actors were age appropriate even the high school ones. Elise Fisher (who was actually in the Despicable Me films) was incredibly natural with her ""ums"", ""uhs"", etc. I remember a topvoted comment on reddit somewhere about something a film doesn't portray realistically and it was about how characters didn't really stutter or think when they talk. 

I like that there wasn't any stereotypical bully antagonist. Kennedy didn't do that mean to Kayla other than ignoring her. Come to think of it, eighth graders are apparently really addicted to their smartphones unless this was done more out of social commentary. Meanwhile, the high schoolers seem to talk more with each other. 

Of course we have to talk about the car scene with the high schooler, Riley. Talk about tense and uncomfortable. It does defy expectations because you expected Riley to assault or rape her, but he doesn't go that far. 

Despite Kayla being sympathetic from lack of friends and being a loner, I did like that she was still portrayed as flawed. The most obvious where she makes hypocritical YouTube videos on advice that she doesn't follow. The second being that she's a real brat to her father who tries real hard with her. 

I find it strange there aren't more serious(in terms of not being patronized to kids) films made about the seventh or eighth grade. Those were middle school grades for me back then, and they can be a lot more awkward than high school. They are after all the transitionary years from elementary kid to almost high school adult with puberty kicking in for some around that. ",945h35

So, I'm a teacher, and I've done middle and high.  When Riley got out of the car, my middle-school-girl protective side went straight up.  I was so tense.  When I saw Riley's mannerisms, and how he handled it, out came my high-school teacher side.  It was very bizarre because at first I was so protective and so tense about a violating moment, and then when Riley's also-childish behavior was pretty apparent, I became really empathetic for both of them while understanding that they were both children and all things considered, however uncomfortable, it was a pretty common experience.  Yes, a 16-17 year old propositioning a 13-14 year old is very uncomfortable for our adult eyes.  But it happens all the time, and remembering that the 16-17 year old was \*also\* a child was a very interesting revelation.  I think a lesser film would have gone out of it's way to make Riley seem predatory, whereas this film makes him seem in-the-wrong, sure, but awkward and unsure.",945h35
e3o4mda,"Ok this is gonna be personal but it's the only thing that's ever made me reflect on my Middle School years in a rational way so..

Everyone talks about surviving Middle School. They don't talk about how much it changes you. I was a completely different person from 5th grade to 8th grade. (Though in some ways, that was because I refused to change enough.)

By 7th grade I was literally leaning against the sides of hallways when I walked alone in school, like some weird, primal instinct. I didn't do this consciously. All the self-confidence had left me. By 8th grade, I was moving my chair close to the teacher's desk when we had to do silent reading because it was the least embarrassing option, when compared to sitting at a table with kids who wouldn't give me a second glance.

And though I didn't go as far as Kayla in terms of trying to reinvent myself, I related to so many things... making plans in spiral notebooks to get my friends back together. Trying to leave myself positive messages. Feeling like I suddenly had all the confidence I had lost when someone I admired talked to me.

I graduated High School in 2016, and didn't get my first camera phone until a year before that, so the social media stuff wasn't as relevant to me. (I loved that scene at the mall where they talked about this. It's so important.) But there were kids with iPhones as early as 2010, in 6th grade. In my 8th grade class, a kid was expelled (iirc) for soliciting nudes, and having some connection to storing or receiving them on his school laptop. It was then that I told myself, *I don't want to be popular anymore. It's not worth it, it's not worth it.*

I'm getting really personal here lol, but I don't have people to discuss this movie with. I am so so glad it exists.

Also, this is the most relatable portrayal of anxiety I've ever seen. When she was talking about how it was like the feeling of waiting to ride a roller coaster without being able to ride a roller coaster... that's the **best** way I've ever seen it described because it shows what anxiety does to you. You avoid your fears, but there's no relief there. You miss the things you could have done, and new fears will always replace them. They pile on top of you and make you shrink.

e43z68l,"My only critique with the movie was the ""gucci!"" at the end. The time capsule and the high school relationship show how rapid change is. Kayla changes throughout the film. Even her videos change in content and tone. However the cliche phrase im torn on. Does it invalidate a significant portion of the change that Kayla exhibits? While she does seem more mature, does its continued use provide further insight to how immature she really is and balance the endings serious tone? On the other hand it feels ironic because of that perceived realization. Gucci as almost like a fuck you to all the stupid bullshit she just now realizes is stupid. 

Maybe its intended to be ambiguous, maybe im reading too much into it. 

Lastly it's kinda scary how much culture permeates into the lives of young people. The entire make a video, like, subscribe, views, gucci stuff makes a statement about how unavoidable this stuff is. I take my own kid into example (11) and see him parroting things that he's never seen before. Stuff like fornite dancing when he's only played it a couple of times.

Bo Burnham in his silver screen debut amazed me, astonished me, humored me. ""Eighth Grade"" is contained with moments that most will relate to, or if you are the counter-parts to Kayla‚Äìincluding the ""popular & stuck-up types"", the ""raging hormone boys"", the ""nice guy"", and others‚Äì maybe those are some characters that will cause regret inside of you due to their certain characteristics that you may have shared with them. However, without the surrounding characters the movie wouldn't have its remarkable charm and realism. 

The shot selection in this film was some of the best that I have seen so far this year. Burnham's wit, anxiety, and humor leaked onto the film through his use of the camera. Two scenes in particular in where the shots used perfected the scene. In the swimming pool scene where we dolly out from a close up to an extreme wide of the entire pool where Kayla is at the top of the frame awaiting the solid wall of terror. Each second of sheer horror for Kayla is amplified by the booming trumpets, and as we witness what Kayla witnesses in a short, yet powerful moment of what she has to encounter. The other scene is the truth or dare game. The uneasiness and worrisome nature of this scene is strongly felt. The decision to keep Kayla in the foreground was key and the lighting to keep Riley in the dark gave him an aura of maliciousness. While watching this scene I was getting worried for what was going to happen to Kayla as each piece of dialogue was further going down a path of ""please don't let it get worse"". 

This was the first A24 film that I have watched, I have watched Lady Bird recently, which is also a fantastic film. A24 seems to know the perfect formula for coming-of-age movies, the authenticity of its writing. In both films it felt like I have been in some of those situations that were presented in both films. But sticking to Eighth Grade the writing was authentic, genuine, real. Alongside with the oscar-worthy performances from Elsie Fisher and Josh Hamilton. 

Highlights for me, these three sequences that are unforgettable. First, is the banana sequence, I can not remember the last time I have laughed in a movie theater so much. The absolute insanity that is the moment to moment revelations for Kayla and her futile attempts to ""practice"" as soon as her dad shows up to end charade. Second, the burning of the time capsule. Some of the best acting in the entire movie is in this scene, but not only that but the weight that the ""burning of all hopes and dreams"" symbolizes. Speaking on behalf of other kids where they may have felt the same way. At the bottom of the bottomless pit. And finally the third, the ending sequence starting from the graduation and ending at the ending. The culmination of all of the advice videos that were made throughout the movie to get Kayla to gather the courage to set Kennedy and her friend straight, Kayla making a new time capsule and video for her future self. The movie didn't end with a ""happily ever after"" ending which was great, because in real life that never happens and in real life we encounter things that we regret, don't want to do, and things we need to do. Eighth Grade is the best film of the year so far and I hope it stays that way until January 1st of next year, unless mid90's or Boy Erased top it.

There were moments where I felt like I was watching a actual snapshot of my life!  The thing that really amazed me about this movie is the fact that it all felt so real, I suppose.  I could see my 8th grade self in Kayla (hell, I could see myself NOW in Kayla.)  I could see my classmates in Kayla.  Her actress is just so great at making Kayla feel... real.

e3v1buq,"I saw this yesterday (Bo's AMA convinced me) and wow I still got a hook in me, the whole experience burned so well into my mind. I don't think a movie has ever made me so emotional and sentimental as hell. Of course like many others I related so much to the scarily accurate portray of a suburban, public school adolescence; doubly so since I was the very quiet type (although thankfully I never won an award for it, ha). But also as a 20 something it's so interesting to get that different perspective from generation that's slightly but noticeably different. Hoping I get to see this movie again.",945h35
e3xo0qd,"I am still reeling from this movie. Just saw it a few hours ago and still thinking about it. Coming from someone who graduated high school just after 2011, thank god I went through my angsty teen years with just the myspace->facebook and T9.

Though this movie runs through some of the beats of other coming of age movies/shows (cool kids rejection, creepy car, cool guy crush), I enjoyed the entire 'line for the rollercoaster' which is the perfect way to describe this movie, that heart wrenching anxiety Kayla nails on the head.

On Edge of my seat at every moment, feeling fear for Kayla, hoping for the best, worrying so much; the dread sinking in with every passing scene...Will cool high school girl turn out to be a mean girl? Will creepy car guy not stop? Will Super Single Dad pull Kayla out? Will she meet the adorable dork?

Over and over I felt like I was in the place of the dad, watching, hoping, worried that Kayla won't grow up to be fucking awesome, afraid that Youtube version of her won't sprout out (excellent acting by Elsie Fisher btw). Thankfully the shoe never dropped, very happy that it didn't, allowing the movie to breath, focusing on the entire journey of the coming of age story rather than trauma (I'm looking at you Perky Wallflower).

I can go on and on, pick apart every little detail where the small youtube piano comedian turned full on writer/director elevated the tropes with smart directing/sound design/cinematography (like how the world is shut off when she is plugged into her social network by literal ear plugs!!)

But what sort of seals the deal for why I truly adore this movie comes from that running motiff, that motivational show that teased a long lost video dream that quite literally became a phoenix, another more mature time capsule, with enough subtle changes (gained from her recent crucible(s)) to motivate Kayla to her next stage of life.

I might not be of the same generation of Kayla but how much do I empathize with her, taken back to my first awkward girl-boy middle school party, to the first joint I was passed (I'm doing you a favor!!), to my first way too cool kid crush (Damn you puberty!).

And like the mall rats debate sums up my point perfectly, 4 years isn't much and based on this movie a decade isn't much either (wow I am getting old).

Whether it be snapchat, yahoo chatrooms, myspace, or ding-dong ditching, growing up is tough and it crosses generations, and no matter what age you are, I imagine ya'll on some level connected with this movie.

If you loved this movie! I highly recommend some other recent and easily accessible Coming of Age movies: Edge of Seventeen, Sing Street (not too Coming but somewhat Agey), Spectacular Now, and Perks of A Wallflower (In that particular order, or in no order at all, your choice).",945h35
e4437d5,"This kind of movie isn't really for me to begin with, I was pretty bored compared to other slice-of-life movies, such as Ladybird. But I can appreciate some things about this movie, like how authentically 8th grade it felt, and the fact that they showed all the social media stuff up close. 

Also, the score is amazing. ",945h35

e3knqph,Elsie Fisher is so gorgeous! Good on Bo Burnham for a first directorial effort. May he win the Oscar,945h35
e3knqh7,"TL;DR Really liked it. Would recommend to various people, including parents and those who work with kids. It does a good job of avoiding some ""coming of age"" tropes that have gotten annoying to me. You might notice some pacing/editing problems but they're minor.

------------------------
There are several times where this movie could've turned into a generic bullying movie but I'm glad it did not. This was less about the direct, in your face, bullying that most parents are scared of and more about a child who's afraid *of* being bullied but can't really find a social group to be a part of since they're not being themselves. I would not say this represents the majority of kids but it does certainly help raise the awareness for the kids who do feel that way. 

You genuinely feel the protag has changed from the beginning to the end and could actually represent a person. They were not just a bumbling fool you were meant to feel sorry for and their development is actually warranted and not too forced.

I think the character interactions/dialog was great. With visual and subtle social cues, the movie gives you those anxiety/cringey feels that the main character is feeling. No one said or did anything over-the-top just for the sake of adding drama or tension which would've also changed the movie's goals.

To elaborate on that point, I'll only list a couple of examples but there are **several** spots where this movie could've nosedived:

- For the pool party scene, in a generic TV movie special, we would've had everyone there stop what they were doing and just start whispering to each other while looking at Kayla when she arrives. It would eventually lead to the point where Kayla gets insulted or laughed at by Kennedy or Steph where Kayla just starts crying, makes a scene, and gets picked up by her dad still in tears. Instead, we got character growth in her doing Karaoke by feigning confidence.

- In the scene where they're under the desks, that convo between Kayla and Aiden(?) leads them to hooking up, him recording/taking pictures, and then her getting bullied/harrassed after the videos/pictures leak between her peers. Completely changing the tone and message of the movie and making it a usual ""careful what you post online kiddos! \*pats self on back*"". Instead, she realizes it's not for her and doesn't go through with getting together with him.",945h35
e3ipat8,"Glad this is up, I saw it a week or so back at one of the advanced screenings (the theatre I work at was one of the first to get it - lucky me!) and I‚Äôve been waiting to hear everyone‚Äôs thoughts. 

What I liked about this movie was how real it was. It portrays middle school as it really is, not in an idealistic way or anything. The whole film has a feeling of awkwardness throughout the entire thing, which is pretty much how middle school is. You feel awkward no matter what you do. 

The social media aspect was really well done. I remember getting FaceBook in middle school right when it blew up and everybody was on it all the time, so I get how Kayla feels about portraying yourself a certain way on social media. I guess I still feel that way. 

The Truth or Dare scene made me want to claw my stomach out of my chest. It was so uncomfortable, but not in a funny awkward way. You get this feeling from Kayla that she feels trapped and scared despite not being in any explicit danger. (That reminds me - Elsie Fisher was incredible! I hope she gets some recognition at the awards shows.) I‚Äôm glad Kayla was able to stand up for herself even though she was so scared. 

The firepit scene with the dad hit way to close to home. That was the scene where I lost it and just starting crying. I had a similar conversation with my dad once and I really felt for Kayla. 

One of the best films I‚Äôve seen this year so far. Hopefully this is the beginning of a long and successful career for Bo Burnham. ",945h35

e3nuzrz,I will come back in 6 months when this is available in my country ,945h35
e3rj8bv,I definitely recommend listening to Bill Simmons Podcast with Bo Burnham from a few weeks ago.  Bill brought his daughter (I think she's 13) on and they all discussed the film.  Very cool to hear her perspective and hear her talk with Bo about it.,945h35

e6w0skz,"I was fairly shy all throughout middle school, but i had quite a few friends. Does Kayla not have any friends because it was easier to focus on her anxieties for the sake of the film? To not have even one girlfriend seemed to be stretching it.",945h35

e3kbj2e,"So I saw this a couple months ago at SIFF with a surprise Q&A with Bo and Elsie. The most shocking thing was learning that all of Kayla‚Äôs ‚Äòlike‚Äôs and ‚Äòumm‚Äôs were scripted. Bo said he chose Elsie because she played it like a shy kid pretending to be confident instead of a confident kid pretending to be shy. 

Elsie Fisher and Bo Burnham have a very exciting future. I hope they gets some awards recognition for this. ",945h35
e3m1es3,"Saw a screening of this film in a middle school auditorium last month.  Bo and the cast were there.  After the movie, they had the gym set up as a middle school dance.  Lots of fun.  Bo, and the entire cast were just hanging out.  They were all incredibly nice.  Jack Ryan is Gabe.  He's so funny in person.


Anyways, the movie:
I loved it.  It was a different, refreshing take on the coming of age tale.  The entire cast hits the beats perfectly.",945h35
e3w3r87,"The thing that made this movie sing for me was Kayla as a protagonist. You can tell she's a sweet girl and she's got a good heart, and once she figures a few more things out, the world is going to open up to her. She's humanized in a way where her flaws aren't overly pronounced and she's not lionized, either, she's natural and real - it almost feels like you're watching a home movie. All of the performances capture that subtle, natural feeling of being lived-in, actually, Josh Hamilton was excellent as her father and the fellow kids hit their marks really well.",945h35
e3m0wh3,"I only have one, single gripe. Super great, trying so hard, very involved and attentive dad would NEVER have accepted ""I'll get a ride home"" with no further details. Especially after seeing 2 boys at the table. Who's driving, whose car, when?


I can give it a pass only because he probably felt super guilty after getting caught snooping.

e3u36cm,"I thought this film was brilliant. 

A)For such an overstimulating world we live in, being allowed to be completely immersed in Kayla's experience, and the relatively slow pace of the plot and longer shots definitely acts as an antidote to the hurried anxiety its portraying. Generally loved the way this was filmed and the music beautifully emphasized the way moments feel, it accurately reflected how feelings strike you, the best example was when she would see Aiden she'd be completely stricken, and the music portrayed that as well.

B) I thought that the whole time capsule is such a spot on and concise way to portray this relationship to self-love vs self-loathing. Being able to look back on ourselves even in less developed parts of our life, and to have empathy and care for that version of ourselves is powerful. Kayla burning the box was like the epitome of her self loathing. But for her to turn around and make a video and time capsule for her future self is so wonderful, its affirming the flawed but lovable person that she is now (its like saying I am choosing to believe that I will be able to look back on myself and experience love not loathing), and also affirming that the future is uncertain and maybe you wont become who you thought you would be but she still loves that undetermined version of herself through thick and thin. Self-love and love for another are not really different mechanisms or paths, and I think we are shown this through a character like Olivia. ",945h35
e7mjng4,"I absolutely loved this movie. It actually reminded me of Welcome To The Dollhouse except with very different philosophies. Both have young female protagonists trying to make sense of the world while growing into adolescence. Both movies take a ""real"" look at being a young woman surrounded by uncertainty amid change. The main difference is that Kayla has a healthy home life and Dawn in Dollhouse has an absolutely horrible home life. They both survive to the end, but Kayla seems like she has the brighter future. Anyway, loved the soundtrack in Eighth Grade. The direction. Everything. ",945h35

e3mmz91,"I was really impressed with how Bo Burnham managed to capture the atmosphere that even he, at 27 years, didn't really experience as far as the availability of social media and smart phones.  Even more impressive was crossing the gender lines and writing a story about a girl that seems to me from reading the girl comments here to be accurate.  

I loved Elsie Fisher's expressions while staring at her phone in the dark or making her videos, how she was able to transition into the person she imagined she wanted to be.  To top it all off, that hunched way she walked so as to shrink into the shadows (i.e. walking around the pool). ",945h35

eb2o03l,"Did not enjoy it. Maybe it‚Äôs more of a movie for adults then it is for teenagers, because to me it felt like a boring slog that made me check me watch every 5 minutes.

Then again maybe it‚Äôs just me. Maybe it‚Äôs more for the people who already finish middle school and realize how stupid they acted back then. Maybe it‚Äôs the kind of thing I‚Äôll understand when I get older. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not really a fan of Bo Burnham‚Äôs comedy and think he‚Äôs unfunny. I don‚Äôt know.

I think the thing that bothers me most is that I feel like while trying to be relatable Bo forgot what makes a good movie. There is no three act structure, no (interesting) conflict, no (okay, maybe there was some) character growth, and no satisfying conclusion. And before you tell me this was a coming of age movie, I know that already, but those movies have those things to.

All in all, Bo accomplished making a relatable movie, without trying to make a good one. Yet because people often confuse those terms, this movie ended up being a big hit.

e3mm4tq,"This film was like watching my own eighth grade on recording while I'm strapped to a chair begging for it to stop. I wanted to leave so many times but I didn't, and I'm glad I didn't. This was so good I'd say it's essential viewing, not regardless of it making you uncomfortable but *because* it makes you uncomfortable. There were so many people in my theater who couldn't handle the awkwardness; I almost wish I had waited to watch it by myself, yet part of me is glad for the tension and sometimes horror we all shared. 

I mean, seriously, I need to reiterate, Bo Burnham is an evil genius for making me sit through that. It's probably the most I've ever yearned to see a character overcome their challenges (I honestly want to know how Kayla is going to do in high school, and what happens with Gabe, and her dad...), but it's also the most I've ever felt like I'm having a heart attack in a movie theater seat.

The performance and writing was certainly the movies es strong suits, but I felt like the cinematography was definitely holding the film back. Sometimes, it's awkward holds and refrain from certainty visuals felt like it added depth to certain scenes, but sometimes it just felt lazy. 

I would love to read the screenplay though because the dialogue seemed crazy improvised to make organic eight grade kid dialogue, but if not, that's insanely well written. 

The scenes I felt so strongly with were the car scene and the fire scene the car scene especially did such a phenomenal way to get across the uncomfortable pressure she felt while the fire scene established the true bond between the father and daughter so we'll.

When they cut to a slow-mo close up at Aiden‚Äôs eyes with the EDM over it, I immediately felt like this was a Bo Burnham movie.

Dad and Gabe were highlights for me. Elsie Fisher is a natural.",945h35
e3imj2b,"The fire scene with Kayla and her father was honestly heartbreaking. I think it might be the most relatable scene in the entire movie, because that feeling of shame/disappointment/uselessness is something that can affect anyone, regardless of age. Overall it's a great film that manages to show anxiety and shyness and awkwardness, and forces the viewer to feel them with Kayla. I cannot say enough good things about it! Another masterpiece by Bo Burnham. ",945h35

e3mpwkc,"favorite movie of the year so far, and it‚Äôs not really close. 


i first discovered bo when i was in eighth grade through his ‚Äúwhat‚Äù special on netflix. since, i‚Äôve been hooked on him. now, as i‚Äôm approaching my senior year, i had high expectations from this movie while also not really knowing what to expect. 


what he does best is captures the inner struggle of what being that age is like-constantly seeking emotional reassurance, truly wondering if someone likes you, if it even matters, etc-and he does it so wonderfully. truthfully, the hardest i cried was during the mcdonald‚Äôs date scene when gabe and kayla connect over rick and morty. the story comes full circle, and you finally see the struggle that kayla deals with (acceptance, awkwardness, etc) fall away. the scene lets the audience exhale in a moment that should be met with full-on cringe. 


tl;dr

bo burnham captures the human struggle of battling with your emotions in such a real, visceral way that it‚Äôs damn-near chilling. go see this movie.",945h35

e3ig7mg,"I loved it, great performance by the lead of course, but the dad was good too ",945h35
e3iie41,"This movie feels nostalgic in some ways, and revealing in others. It‚Äôs hard finding acceptance in eighth grade: you‚Äôre not sure about who you are, your body‚Äôs changing (it‚Äôs gonna be lit), and you start developing emotions and thoughts you‚Äôve never had before. But this new generation has the added pressure of social media. 

Kayla has to fake her makeup every morning just to post one picture. She makes a lot of YouTube videos even though only 5 people see it at best. She has to deal with naked pictures that can be sent instantly. It‚Äôs a whirlwind of things that even someone as young as me couldn‚Äôt have imagined experiencing in middle school. 

I really like this movie a lot for that realistic portrayal. Burnham did a fantastic job. I‚Äôm not sure if that approach is replicable to other facets of life, but it‚Äôll be interesting to see how he changes or adapts to different stories and scripts. The camera work felt natural, the music was timed great, and the characters felt real and relatable. Definitely one of the better movies of the year. ",945h35
e3kbdav,"My favorite part was how it appeared that parts of the movie weren‚Äôt even written. They were too well performed to have been improvised, but were incredibly impressive. Common writing tips tell you to write dialogue like it‚Äôs real people actually talking, which is hard to do as people pause a lot, say things like ‚Äòlike‚Äô, and ‚Äòum‚Äô, which don‚Äôt usually go into most scripts. This film was written to be realistic in the delivery of its dialogue, which sold the whole thing. ",945h35
e3jvmte,"I love that Bo created a character out of a teenage girl that we call can relate to. I know he's said that he meant it to be more of a look into his own anxiety, so it's neat to see how that plays out so well in Kayla. 

Elsie killed it. The fire scene has to be my favorite, but I also love the scene where she tells off the cool girls and can't manage to make eye contact the whole time. Too real.",945h35

The performances are so fantastic that the line between film and reality is totally blurred to uncomfortable but powerful results.

This one will have me thinking for a long time. All hail A24!",945h35
e3ll5ci,My favorite part of the movie was that somebody fell asleep in the back of the theatre and they were snoring loudly. I think they were homeless.,945h35
e3jbv4u,"Kind of disappointed I'll be honest. I had high hopes for this movie. It seemed like Bo said ""This movie is gonna be social awkwardness in one of the most awkward times of people's lives"" and then patted himself on the back and stopped the creativity there. Seriously, some scenes weren't even realistic and took me out of the movie because they were more annoying to watch than awkward. Like the scene where she talks to the two popular girls on their phones. Yes society is obsessed with phones, yes youth seem to be more disconnected with reality than ever before sometimes. But those girls literally said nothing to her or even glanced at her and then mumbled like zombies, it was not believable in any way.

Whats worse is that the movie's awkward scenes relied so heavily on the slow passage of time that I found myself taken out because - as any once socially awkward person would know - social awkwardness isn't just large periods of silence, they can be quick and not painful to think about until moments later. Eventually every awkward scene felt so on the nose and the  social media/phone aspect of everything felt stupidly heavy-handed. You made a statement about social awkwardness and technology in today's world, wonderful, some scenes are great... but what else do you have to offer? I feel like I could have watched two or three 15-minute shorts of awkward situations and gotten just as much out of the movie as I did with this

That said, I liked the movie, it was ok. But making a relatable movie isn't enough to make it a great movie, this felt like a heavily watered down Lady Bird or Perks. you could argue that it is meant to feel like a slice out of life with no dramatic twists and turns like those movies, but this is cinema, there has to be a sense of deliberation in what I'm seeing on screen",945h35
e3ja1dm,"I watched probably 95% of this movie through my fingers and that's the highest compliment I can think of lol.

e3nwzbe,"I think this is a good movie but I feel like most of the problems come down to Bo Burnham's kinda amateurish direction. The camera just kinda stares at people for long pits with these very slow pans. Thought the soundtrack was particularly jarring in most places. There isn't a whole lot of characters aside from Kayla and her dad and there's lot of subplots that are just dropped by the end. (What happened with the crush on Aiden? What happened with Olivia?) The movie was only 90 minutes but felt sooo long.

I do think Elsie Fisher did a great job and Bo absolutely understands what kids have to go through these days with that extra layer of social isolation but you always have to put yourself out there. The themes come through and there are great bits of humor.  (The Banana Scene and School Shooting Drill are highlights) Very real and honest movie but I don't really take away anything big from this movie. I'm looking more forward to what Bo Burnham, Elsie Fisher, and Josh Hamilton do from here",945h35

e3zmqd1,"Eighth Grade is a film I think everyone can relate to in some form or another.

It's led by the fantastic performance of Elsie Fisher in the main role of Kayla, and directed by Bo Burnham. I can't say I've seen anything else by Mr. Burnham, but he definitely did a great job here. The shots do well to accent whatever we're seeing play out on the screen and do justice to what Kayla is going through. There's a panic attack scene in set in a bathroom and the camera work makes us feel like we're experiencing it too. Very well done.

The story is relatable, I think everyone will find something about this film they've gone through personally or recognize Kayla suffering from a feeling or emotion they felt as a teenager too. Bo Burnham also wrote the script, and I think he absolutely nailed the struggles a middle-schooler faces. From issues with self-confidence to trying your hardest (and failing, a lot of the time) to make friends, it's all here and it's expertly crafted.

We see the character of Kayla peel back over the course of the film, coming to doubt herself more and more. She eventually gives up making videos, which is a hobby that we see she puts so much time and effort into, yet only to get a few views. Things don't go well for her when she tries to make friends. This film captures the feeling of trying and failing as a teenager, and it does so with very little in the way of flaws.

There's a few loose story threads that either don't go anywhere, or don't end up with a resolution. Kayla has a crush on a boy, but the plot is dropped midway through the film. She finds someone she really likes as a friend, but they never speak again after a particular scene that doesn't involve her directly. These don't detract from the effectiveness of the film but they do leave lingering questions.

I give Eighth Grade 4/5 stars. It's a fantastic film and should be seen by everyone. You'll find something for yourself here. It's funny, it hits home, and it's thoroughly successful at being a film that captures what life is like for a teenager in present-day.",945h35
e3js0yi,"Saw this last night. I cried for ten solid minutes near the end, surrounding and during the fireside chat. I've *never* cried that hard in a theater before, not even with Ladybird, or Manchester By The Sea, or The Edge of Seventeen.

I feel like if people had even a *sort-of* kind-of okay childhood, they'll be very, very touched by Burnham's cutting truth. I think others will be destroyed.",945h35
e3iuzev,"It's a 3 out of 5. I won't say much more because this is one of those films that people freak out if you don't think it's perfect. It's good, some parts are amusing, a lot of the dialogue is so-so, and the cinematography isn't so great. Outstanding for a first effort and cute.",945h35
e3kfs1y," ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω

Probably one of the most honest depictions of what it's like to be thirteen years old.

I heard some people compare this to Ladybird which is crazy, they're both very different films. Ladybird felt more scripted and had like an actual beginning middle and an end. This movie feels more like we're a fly on the wall, watching this girl grow up. It's a really honest portrayal of a girl who is shy. The main actress in it is fantastic.

But because it's so honest to what it's like to be thirteen, you're going to cringe... a lot. It's kind of like looking back at an old photo of yourself from 15 years ago and thinking ""Oh god, what was I thinking"". It was humbling at times too because it forced you to think about your own self and how much you've grown up over the years.

Really dug the 80s synth score in this as well. Came in at some of the most perfect moments.

I have to say the father in this movie for me was a bit creepy. Just didn't like his performance and he just rubbed me the wrong way. Also it dragged a bit at times little and was fairly predictable. Still a pretty impressive movie for Burnham's first and I look forward to what he does next.",945h35

e3iq4ie,"""Eighth Grade"" is one of the best movies I have ever seen about teenagers as it deals with the real problems they face and not in a soap opera way which we see in many television shows. Yes, there are parts which made me feel uncomfortable, but that's the point. Those years had us living through situations that were awkward to say the least. I loved how Bo Burnham never turned a blind eye to the unsettling moments and emotions we all experienced at that age. Kids who just graduate from junior high will get a lot of this film.

I wish the film ended when she said she would stop making videos after the amazing (terrifying) Truth or Dare scene. She closes her laptop and the film cuts to black as the screen clicks shut.

It was really funny, had a great portrayal of a single father, and really relatable. I thought it also had a great score and it's lack of visual style and color made it feel really honest. All the performances were pretty great too. 

However sometimes I felt like it was a little too in your face and felt like it was how Bo imagined being a 13 year old girl was like. Some of the stuff really required you to suspend your disbelief for the movie to progress. Some underwritten characters and pacing issues. I wish I didn't feel this way but I don't think people will remember it in a few years. Kind of like how I felt about A Quiet Place. Good, but ultimately forgettable.

2) Her accosting Kennedy in the hallway during ‚Äúgraduation‚Äù was very out of line and extremely ‚ÄúNice Guy‚Äù antics.

e3igkwe,My wife clawed the shit out of my arm during that scene. It's hard to watch,945h35
e3ih89w,"It was a brilliant scene. Kayla went from being incredibly torn, to finding her voice and spirit for a split second when she finally said no, then humiliated. Incredibly acted and directed. ",945h35
e3iiu0q,I thought it was going to turn out a lot worst. Thankfully it didn't.  I like how real it was despite how uncomfortable it was. I thought it was truly fantastic that Bo was able to shine light on a situation that I believe happens a lot to young kids in those situations. ,945h35
e3knkrj,"Yes!! >!When he said that it was awkward talking to her in the back seat and pulled over, obviously everyone thought she was just going to move into the front seat; but when he moved to the back, my whole theater gasped/groaned/‚Äúoh no...‚Äù!< I looked over at my two friends I saw it with, and one had sunk so low into her chair that her hair was on the seat cushion, and the other had his head between his knees with his hands over his head/ears. 

This scene was far far too relatable. Very hard to watch. ",945h35

e9a6xc4,"I thought the movie handled the balance of unbearable awkwardness but also good things happening extremely well and shouldn‚Äôt go unnoticed.

When she was shadowing  her High School counterpart I was on edge, waiting for the shoe to drop, like just waiting for the high schooler to end up being a huge disappointment or do something awful and she wasnt. The decision to keep her as a positive persona was so important to this film and made me think strongly of people were kind to me when they didn‚Äôt have to be. Those types of interactions at that age have a powerful sustaining impact on people.

A lesser director would‚Äôve taken the bait and make something bad happen, and in doing so would have created a lesser film.

e8ld8oz,Just watched it and came to confirm that other people were as fuckin wigged out by that shit as I was. Worse than any horror movie I ever seen. goddamn ,945h35
e3iuqb7,Legit had to walk out for a minute. Couldn't make myself watch that.,945h35

e3t612m,"I don't do that, but I *very* tightly folded my arms and dug my nails in. Kind of a response to quell the unease in my stomach. Didn't help. I stopped breathing naturally in that scene and didn't really exhale until the credits.",945h35
e457lgd,I hope they explained to these children how terrible the guy was.,945h35
e4a04wh,"when he stopped and came out the car in my mind I literally had the jontron gif of him blowing a whistle and yelling rape. every moment was fucking tense from that scene. I think the worst part is that it feels like something like this happened in real life, I know or at least I remember rumors about a kid in high school that would fuck some freshman girls, he would always get shit on with his friend group for doing that kind of shit. ",945h35
e3jgohm,"That was the most emotionally devastating moment for me. It truly hit the nail on the head for what I was experiencing at the time. No bullies pushing kids in lockers, no pack of nerds who at least have each other and play DnD. Just pure isolation and a lack of any self esteem. I could relate to nearly every single scene in this film. 

A lot of people empathize with Kayla, but I think that Kayla's experience is still fairly unique, which is probably why I cried three times during the film. ",945h35
e3ka6xo,"During that scene I thought we were gonna find out the mother died, but hearing that she just ‚Äúleft‚Äù made it way more sad for me. ",945h35
e4ngpix,That was such a strong scene. At first he seemed to kind of be saying generic stuff she wanted to hear just like he did in the beginning when he was telling Kayla she was cool. But then he really dug deeper and talked about how lovely she was as a child and how he was scared after the Mom left. His dialogue went from cookie cutter dad talk to the real talk that Kayla needed and that their father/daughter relationship needed. ,945h35
e4g11lz,I was full on sobbing during that scene,945h35
e9w2hmq,"I also liked how genuine and honest his answer could be. I mean, I don't want to say that parents talking about special and perfect their child is isn't ""true"", because they do believe it, that's just how many parents are. But they always say that. But when she's specifically asking about whether he's happy to have her as a daughter, you knew that his response would be 100%, completely genuine, because I'm sure no matter what troubles she has, she's probably one of the best parts of his life.

e3ili1q,"I loved that this tension-relieving moment of all the 'how do I connect with people??' anxiety was a simple ""I like that show too!"" The movie had a lot to say about identity at that age but I thought that was such a simple and relatable moment.",945h35
e3jolu5,"I couldn't agree more! Without the juxtaposition of Riley's creepiness, Gabe's chicken nugget scene would have been laughably cringey on the other spectrum. Something Dwight Schrute would pull.

But that sweetness (and spiciness) and (chicken) tenderness that Gabe shows in his own unique way, is not only relieving, it's the exact thing that Kayla needed in her life at that moment. It really highlighted how important kindness and respect can be, even if it's bacon-wrapped in cheesy dorkiness.

That sharpshooter got his 4th bullseye that day.",945h35
e3j1tnw,"I was in a live Q&A  back when it initially released and Bo said when he came in for the audition Bo told him to have small talk with Elsie and he said ""Do you like tacos?"" and followed it up with ""Hard or soft-shelled?"" and that's when he knew he got the role and Bo said he separated both of them from there on out until they filmed the scene together.",945h35
e3ihoeq,I saw it a few weeks ago and they had a livestream Q&A afterwards. Bo said there is a 15 minute magic show that Gabe did that they cut from the film. Bo said it'll be in the deleted scenes on the bluray.,945h35

ebyzb8h,I was getting some serious ReviewOfTheWeek vibes from Gabe and I fucking loved it.,945h35
e3jkk0g,Both dads in the movie were great. Kayla's dad was so wholesome and Kennedy's dad just wanted everyone to eat his damn cake that he woke up at 6 in the fucking morning to make.,945h35
e3jvtqx,"God, too true.  I'm a single dad (with a daughter that's just started high school) and we went to see it together.  I was relieved that Kayla's dad was just a guy that's trying his best in uncharted waters, fumbling for words at times, making bad decisions, but ultimately so in love with his daughter that he'd do anything for her.  He's not played as a buffoon or a foil or a wet blanket.  He wants the best for Kayla and doesn't quite know how to help her during a time when no one really knows what to do or say.",945h35
e3odgcg,That scene where she burned everything in her time capsule was so well acted by both actors,945h35
e3ojkcp,I felt like Bo Burnham casted himself in 20 years.,945h35

e3jyqvz,"Yeah, Stranger Things gives dads a bad name.",945h35
e3o61b9,"I thought he was a schmuck. You‚Äôre supposed to guide your kid, not coddle them. Plus, he had no personality or life independent of her.  I get that it‚Äôs her movie, not his, but he felt very one-dimensional. ",945h35

e3t4nh1,"Oh yeah for sure, anyone who was in middle school band can relate. That scene was on point. ",945h35
e6qhqyv,"damn I just realized I've never heard a school band, can't imagine what it's like to be a teacher of it. guess you'd have to have a braided rat tail",945h35
e3sfj21,I watched this with a few of my friends who were never in band and I was the only one cracking up. Such a hilarious scene though.,945h35
eequh6v,"I mean to be honest, middle school bands don‚Äôt sound that bad. Maybe the lowest band, or fifth graders just learning to play their instruments, but definitely not the top band. Maybe that‚Äôs just because I was in a competitive school district for band, but wind ensembles in middle schools of my area were of serviceable quality. ",945h35
e3o7jbd,"I thought that young actor killed it, absolutely killed. He was hilarious, and nervous, confident and insecure and above all kind person, all in one go. Very impressive. ",945h35
e3qwt60,Bo said in his AMA that they had to update some things because stuff wasn't trending anymore. Like how they started doing shots using Messenger but they switched to Instagram because its so much more popular with teens now.,945h35
e3mlkht,*dabs*,945h35
e3vdm4w,"Middle schoolers tend to be a year or two behind high schoolers. You'll still find some eighth graders dabbing and thinking fidget spinners are cool right now, though most moved on eventually. Of course, teachers are like three years behind middle schoolers, so that all works too.",945h35
e3p3nvy,"I knew when I was watching it that there'd be other people that relate with her even though they're not the same age, and to a point, I somewhat do. I definitely related more to her when I was in middle school though.

The thing that hurt the most out of the whole film was when [she says in her final YouTube video that she just feels nervous all the time. Like she's about to get on a roller coaster, and that butterfly feeling in her stomach. But she never gets the triumphant feeling after, she just keeps feeling nervous](#spoiler) and all I could think was ""jesus christ, this girl is portraying how I felt up until the age of 17""",945h35
e3vu7o5,"That part is also why I'm extremely anxious about watching the movie, like I'm 19 and I've watched people change from cringe machines to confident people who put all of their troubles behind them and have majorly changed in the process.

In contrast, from the comments here, I feel I don't relate because I didn't try to be cool, hang out with guys, have major self esteem issues or change myself as a person. Obviously, eight grade was cringey as, but far as growth and confidence goes, I wouldn't say I'm there yet, and it's only now after high school that I'm starting to get these self-esteem issues... 

Oh well, life is strange, hopefully I can work towards it slowly, it doesn't seem to come naturally to some people, which is sad.",945h35
e3t3yp2,Me too. I have tried a few times to explain why but I just keep crying. These themes are definitely not something just kids in school or young people deal with. ,945h35
e6qhxpr,"I'm fairly confident and I was the class clown, I can't imagine what it's like if my daughters have social anxiety. My brain says 'just go out there and try and talk, who cares' but someone with anxiety simply can't do that. ",945h35
e3winqz,"I too grew up alone and had anxiety as an only child.  But I never had a desire to ""fit in"".  I always did my thing.  I had friends who were just you know, people I knew.  You just haven't found your ""tribe"" yet.  I know this sounds cliche but ""you will always be your best friend"" and you gotta love yourself.  It's just an attitude thing.  The best line someone told me was ""if you don't like yourself, how are you gonna get others to like you? It's only when you like who you are, that others will like you as well because you are best judge of who you are""  *Hugs*",945h35
e7ptnlo,I work with teenagers and every so often have to go visit high schools during their lunch.  The first time I did it I left furious at myself because it felt like the 10 plus years of growing after high school were gone.  I was right back in that awkward spot of social anxiety.,945h35

e3r1i3e,Those last moments were so heartbreaking. You could see how naive and misinformed she was about what really went down and it made me so sad seeing her feel like she did something wrong. Really heartbreaking to see her thinking it was in her best interest for no one to find out because of how he manipulated her,945h35
e6qi0ao,I was thinking he would twist the story and tell Olivia some bullshit and she wouldn't be friends with Kayla anymore,945h35
e3ipcml,"I know, I liked that she was just a genuinely nice person who liked having a little friend she could guide. More people are like that in real life than movies would portray.",945h35
e3iqf2q,"I kept waiting for that to happen, and was really relieved when it didn‚Äôt. Having the truth or dare scene cut that relationship from the story was FAR more effective imo.",945h35
e3jew4c,"I feel this comment so much. I was so scared that it was going to go that route, especially with how awkward Kayla was acting. I was bracing for it while they were at school, during the phone scene, and during the scene where they were at the mall. It's refreshing to actually have a clearly good-intentioned and candid character not backstab the audience.",945h35
e3jmdwk,"what'd you make of her wearing the DARE shirt? was she doing it ironically, or genuinely? also just realizing the foreshadowing of the car scene now.......ick",945h35
e3qlu2e,Olivia is what convinces me this movie is optimistic. She is cute and has friends but she is almost as awkward as Kayla and mentions several times that she didn't have friends in eighth grade either so I like to imagine that in 4 year Kayla will be where Olivia is now.  ,945h35
e3on2cl,"I was so glad that she recognized that it would be an uncomfortable situation for Kayla to go home alone with the highschool guy. But then she didn't really put up a fight, which is a strong statement on how insidious stuff like that can be, even when you have the best intentions and are looking out for others.",945h35
e3o7ea5,I think the fact that so many people were so ready for her to turn heel says a lot about how we view kids and their interactions. There are way more kids like her than we‚Äôre inclined to think.,945h35
e3kxceq,"i'm in hs and that is legitimately how i talk to people in middle school/younger because i know how nervous they are to be around someone older and ""cooler"" than they are; that's exactly how i felt when i was them.",945h35
e4ngxp8,"Me too. I was so expecting her to do something mean or not pick up the phone or ditch her at the mall or something, but was so happy she turned out to be just a fun, nice girl who gets it. I loved that she told Kayla she didn‚Äôt meet her friends until high school  ",945h35
e3tqdxs,Kayla saying she wanted a best friend when she had her dad all along. My heart.,945h35
e3n6cub,I love that part. She keeps her head down and doesn‚Äôt look at the girls even once but she‚Äôs still so proud of herself! Awesome scene ,945h35
e3irxzu,Was this the 5th grade Kayla or the 8th grade Kayla?,945h35
e3ir40b,I cried during that scene because I remember feeling exactly what she was feeling at that age towards my mother... :(,945h35
e44kii8,I cried a lot at that scene. Both from relating to feelings Kayla was having and from wishing I had a dad more like hers when I was younger.,945h35
e47pk2j,"Super late reply but this was the highlight of the movie for me. Having depression/anxiety I could relate to Kayla but also as a recent father I could relate to the Dad. Her dad was phenomenal, both acting and character. ",945h35
e3q6y7w,"Between that and her high school friend Olivia, this movie was so real that it was unpredictable. I was thinking ""Oh great, the typical I hate my father eighth grader"" Nope. And then I was sure Olivia was going to turn out to back stab Kayla. Nope. I even though Riley was going to turn out to be the next crush that she transitioned from middle school to high school with. Big Nope.",945h35
e3whtjs,"Yes, but as a parent, lot of us are not big on ""I told you so"".  I like having confirmation in my child that the advice I gave them worked for them.  It lends agreement and often it's nice to know we agree on things that work out for them.  To me, I need to hear that to increase trust.  Kids don't share that with us and it sucks cause we're walking about and wondering ""I wonder if my child knows if she's in the backseat alone with a guy, she's probably too young to be in that situation"".  We need to hear ""yeah, he tried to get in the back seat with me, and I dashed right out of there to be safe just like you told me to dad.  Thanks for telling me it's okay to flee when I'm am afraid"".",945h35
e3k4hm7,"When he approached her in the pool with, ‚Äúwanna see me do a hand stand?‚Äù My husband almost lost it.  I know that‚Äôs exactly how my husband was in middle school, including the breath holding contest.  ",945h35

I kinda wish I had scene it with a bigger audience, hopefully I'll get that when I see it a 2nd time.",945h35
e6qh2tl,she played the part like she was gonna barf so good,945h35
e3mgf2s,An older lady decided to go get a refill during that scene. And then conveniently again during truth or dare. ,945h35
e3ti5e6,"That's interesting. I thought the theme (or lesson) of the movie was more acceptance than empathy, but I can see your point. ",945h35
e3j1fde,"I genuinely felt like she wasn't acting at times but rather just became the awkward, anxiety-ridden girl herself, encompassing the character in a way that just seemed so natural and fitting. Faking a speech impediment can be really hard but she absolutely nailed all the rhythms and inflections.",945h35
e3jq5xz,"The most impressive thing to me is that all those ""um""s, ""uh""s, ""like""s, ""blah""s, etc, were straight-up scripted. Elsie is just phenomenal. ",945h35
e3ky55g,"Elsie was perfect for this role. Little tangent, but I just loved Kayla as a character in general. She was so easy to root for, and not just because she was an awkward, shy kid. She was *extremely* brave throughout the movie and I loved that about her! Even today i 100% would not have had the balls to go to a pool party of people i was unfamiliar with or tell off assholes who were rude to me like she did. So many other pieces just expect you to root for a character bc *ohh i'm so awkward and pathetic and helpless* but this movie actually gave her a great character outside of that.",945h35
e3veoqx,"I loved every time someone stumbled over their words. You never see that happen in movies or TV unless it's to serve some purpose (eg some super embarrassing speech or something) when it happens all the time in real life. The principal, the dad, the kids, all stumbled over their words at some point. Contributed to the realness of it.",945h35

But while I absolutely love that scene from CMBYN, it is so clearly written, too perfectly articulated to be real. It worked for that movie but why I think the fire scene here was perfect was because it fit well in this movie. The father here was clearly speaking sincerely but he was fumbling over his words because that‚Äôs what happens in real life when an unexpected moment to connect comes up. He has some moments of clarity that really get across his point but  mostly he is just repeating himself and saying platitudes because that‚Äôs what real people do. To me this was a theme throughout the movie, so many scenes (the dinner with the boy at the end, the scene in the food court, the pool party) that felt very grounded in reality rather than movie tropes.

One of my favorite parts of this movie was how well everyone did at SOUNDING NORMAL. Everyone speaks in a natural cadence, nothing overly scripted, and not afraid to even let the adults have misspeaks and flubs. 

The Dad had no idea how to talk to his daughter for the entire movie. It would‚Äôve been completely  unrealistic for him to suddenly deliver a sage and masterful speech.

The speech the teacher gave was amazing, and I cried my eyes out at how everybody else sees what I see when I look at her, it felt really good. So, despite much experience to the contrary, there actually are good people out there, and teaching your kids to love themselves can make them almost bulletproof. Shit still happens, but recovering from it is so much faster and easier when they have a solid sense of self and decent self esteem from being loved unconditionally.

Like, I wouldn‚Äôt have told either of my parents about the car thing, but if I felt like I had to I could tell my mom. But not my dad b/c what can a dad do, he doesn‚Äôt know how that feels and he would probably go hunt that kids parents down and just make the practical situation so much worse. Some guy was commenting ‚Äúshe obviously told her dad, you see him barge in‚Äù and every single female commenter was like ‚Äúshe *absolutely* did not tell him‚Äù.

In doing that, it perfectly underlines the fears of acceptance that Kayla feels and stroked a mark that she might make her dad feel sad. Her own mother left and doesn't even feel the need to come to her daughter's middle school graduation. 

I really didn't connect to the middle school directly (though it's authentic from what I saw when I taught) since I had such a different experience, but Mark's speech afterwards is so frank, raw, and sincere that I broke down.

This was such a great choice. I didn't pick up on it until the 2nd or 3rd video, but it was such a great way to allow the viewer (regardless of age/sex) to really put themselves into the mindset of an adolescent teenage girl.

2. Her first time capsule is more object-driven and superficial like with the Brad Pitt picture --> second capsule has some of the McDonald's sauces.

And most importantly,

3. Social media is a massive source of anxiety for her with Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube --> she takes a break from the videos, realizes how fake a lot of people are online, and develops a personal relationship with real friends

1) In her new 8th grade time capsule are photo booth pictures of her with Olivia (99% sure)...

It's a nice thought that what happened on the drive back that night didn't keep her from wanting to remember her friendship with Olivia via her time capsule.

2) In her new 8th grade time capsule are *also* two nuggets sauce packs. Meaning she either went out of her way to (secretly?) take those home to remember her first ""friend hangout"" with Gabe, or he gave them to her to take home, cause that's just the kind of gentleman Gabe is.

The Supreme Court proceedings prompted the conversation and i‚Äôm Sure life conditions make things harder or easier to talk about depending what‚Äôs going on.

I‚Äôve been trying to help her tell her story because the person that did it is a highly accomplished person in the infectious disease scientific field. 

Like a lot of women, she, too, is weighing the pros and cons of telling someone her story while maintaining her career. It‚Äôs her story to tell, and I will be there in any way to help. I‚Äôve encouraged her to tell as a few people around her now so that in the future she can go back to them for corroboration. Seeing the Supreme Court and metoo backlash about why people waited so long naturally makes her hesistant.

For anyone who sees this comment, just know it is extremely difficult to tell someone you‚Äôve been assaulted.

I first watched it three days ago, and I still don't feel quite the same. Perversely, a huge compliment to the movie.

The scene where we see Kayla's facial expression right after she explains to Kennedy what the card game birthday present is absolutely destroys me. Elsie Fisher was not only perfectly cast for the role, but was absolutely incredible at playing it. The whole thing felt so real, which I hope explains at least some of my surprisingly emotional reaction to it.

On your comment about it not feeling like a comedy, I felt largely the same way the first time I watched it, but I think only because it was pulling so hard on my empathy strings. As I watched it the third time (I never do that, seriously) today, I started appreciating the comedic moments more for what they are. E.g. When she does that robo-shooting hands thing after saying ""catch ya laterrrr"" to Kennedy; the first time I saw it I was hanging on every bit of sadness and awkwardness, felt horrible for her, and couldn't even notice the inherent hilarity (sadness-tinged) of that moment.

In my experience, the boys who put me in those situations enjoyed doing it. I was invited to a ‚Äúparty‚Äù by a classmate and when I showed up expecting a party, it was just 5 older boys and no adults. One of them was a team captain. They offered me weed and alcohol and started trying to engage me in the truth or dare business until I snapped at them and told them they could just do stuff to each other.

edfwt0s,"I agree that the ""gucci!"" at the end wasn't one of my favorite parts, though I think I see the reason they did it. It seems like it was used as a way to show she was back to her good ol' self (at least, the chipper Kayla we saw only in her YouTube videos). If you remember, she always said ""gucci"" at the end of her videos with a pretty upbeat tone... but then when she was at probably her lowest point in the movie and made the video telling her ""audience"" she wasn't going to make videos anymore, she ended that video by first almost forgetting to even say ""gucci"" because she was so sad, and then finally saying it as she was fighting back tears and so she had contempt in her voice for it because her mood was currently so far removed from the cheerfulness that sign-off used to represent.

My only problem with the ""gucci"" at the end wasn't so much that they did it (since I understand why), it was just how they had her do it. I'm guessing they said something like ""be EXTRA confident and chipper when doing it now"" to prove she was back to her happier self, and to me it just looks a little... off, or... over-exaggerated, or not like her.

I did have similar thoughts on whether it was also supposed to keep things grounded in reality, like ""even though she just ended with this rather mature speech, let's keep it real: she is still just an eighth grade girl."" But I do think that's reading too much into it: I think it was mostly just a way for them to end on a happy note in showing that she was back to her chipper-video-making self (with a dash of extra confidence), and maybe also a little of that ""wrapping up by tying it all back to something from earlier in the script"" that stand-up comedians often like to do in their routines (a la Bo Burnham writer/director).

Also, fyi, Bo had said she needed a sign-off for her videos, and this is how it became ""gucci"": [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IKyfcAeRik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IKyfcAeRik)",945h35

e3k1itv,"> Yes society is obsessed with phones, yes youth seem to be more disconnected with reality than ever before sometimes. But those girls literally said nothing to her or even glanced at her and then mumbled like zombies, it was not believable in any way.

You missed something here.  The reason they ignored her wasn't because they're phone-obsessed but because they reject her socially.  They're in the popular clique and refuse to associate with her, period.  Even when they're not using their phones.  Even when at her birthday and she opens the gift from Kayla, she doesn't even look at Kayla once or say thank you.  She just says ""what is it."" and puts it down.  They're bitchy middle school girls who reject her altogether, and they use their phones as a way to isolate her from their attention.  It's not just because the phones are distracting them from her.",945h35

I disagree with you about the rest, but that scene bothers me because it's just not realistic, even the most popular girls would actually look at someone who's talking to them, and not just respond with ""what?"" A more realistic thing would be to have them pretend to be super nice then have Kayla see them laughing as walking away or something.",945h35
e3prhug,"IMO, the crush on Aiden was resolved.  Aiden was only interested in nude pics and getting blowjobs.  Kayla was seriously considering giving Aiden those things (Lying to Aiden about having nude pics of herself and looking up videos on giving good BJs), not because she wanted to (she was very shy during the BJ tutorial video), but because she was desperate for his attention.  But then the Truth or Dare scene happened, and she realized she wasn't ready for sexual stuff and her confidence is destroyed (let's face it, Riley was an older, more manipulative version of Aiden).  Then her fireside pep talk with her father and then her dinner date with Gabe (where she's genuinely pursued after in a respectful way) rebuilds her confidence and self esteem.  Finally, Kayla sees Aiden and instead of going gaga over him like before, she walks right past him to go confront the mean popular girl from earlier and stand up for herself.  The subplot wasn't about her crush for Aiden, it was her overcoming using guys to validate her self worth.

Olivia also served her purpose in the story.  Olivia was in the story to give Kayla a ""success story"", somebody for Kayla to strive to be.  Olivia also gave Kayla a chance, to give Kayla an opportunity to put herself out there more without the fear of automatic rejection (like she received during the pool party).  She had a chance to socialize with a clean slate...this was the blessing that Kayla prayed for the night before and she had to act on it.  Kayla's friendship with Olivia wasn't the focus of the plot, it was Kayla gaining the courage to put herself out there more.

In fact, the whole plot line of the movie was Kayla's inner conflict, which is why the movie was just a bunch of scenes and moments that seemingly don't go anywhere.  There was very little external conflict, pretty much just the Truth or Dare scene and a mild conflict in Kayla's father trying to reach out to her throughout the movie.",945h35

As for the high school girl, it's true that you don't find out anything more about their friendship, but you don't get to find out anything more about the entire rest of Kayla's life either. I don't really consider that a problem with the movie.

Maybe Kayla calls the girl and explains what happens... but I think it's likely she cuts off contact with all of the high school group because that lets her avoid the situation entirely. Or maybe she does stay in touch without explaining the situation, but that would be hard to do if the girl wants to meet up again and the other guy might be there...",945h35

I just got home from the theater, let me do my best. I don't exactly recall where the dinner date landed in chronological order. Trying to remember the main character development / plot points after that scene..

Did you see her burn her 6th grade time capsule? Basically she burns that with help from her dad, and expresses her insecurity to her dad by telling him that if she had a daughter like her then she would be sad about it. Her dad is amazed by this and explains that she is such a fantastic person and he's so happy to be her dad. She responds to him with a hug, the scene worked well and was very touching. 

While in line at the eight grade graduation she walks over to that popular girl (birthday party girl) and basically Kayla expresses her thoughts about how she doesn't get treated kindly even though she treats her kindly, birthday girl doesn't really respond, though she isn't given much time to, Kayla sorta word vomits then quickly walks away. She feels good about that confrontation, shown with a close up shot of a smile as she walks away.

Kayla creates a time capsule video for herself to open up when she graduates high school, saves it to a flash drive and puts in in a time capsule shoe box with other items like a mcdonalds sauce, etc. We see that video like all the other videos and it's how the movie goes out.",945h35
e3o4ejc,"Yeah! So first, you need to finish the dinner scene. It‚Äôs gold.

1. Teenagers *are selfish*. As a teenager, I was absolutely awful to my grandmother (who I lived with in a situation similar to Kayla and her Dad‚Äôs). It took me until adulthood to truly realize how bad I was. Most of the time teenagers don‚Äôt have the maturity or experience to truly understand how awful they‚Äôve been. 

2. I don‚Äôt think her anger at Kennedy was because she didn‚Äôt want to be her friend. It was because she never even gave her the common courtesy of treating her like a person. When someone‚Äôs nice to you, you should be nice back. Kayla wasn‚Äôt wrong for expecting that. ",945h35

That scene, however; yeah, that did it. I don't think I've ever been that uncomfortable watching a movie before. My theater was packed, and you could just *feel* how uneasy everyone was.

e3jwcnc,">!Kayla was being driven home by her new friend Olivia and Olivia's male friend (I forgot his name) after hanging out at the mall. Olivia and her friend are both High School seniors, while Kayla's only in the 8th grade.  Olivia's friend, who is driving, dropped off Olivia first, and now it's just Olivia's friend and Kayla by themselves in the car.  Olivia's friend then parks the car and gets into the backseat with Kayla, wanting to chill with her for a bit.  !<

>!He offers to play a game of Truth or Dare and uses the game to try and pressure Kayla to take her shirt off and start stuff with her.  You can just FEEL the anxiety and tension in this scene, as its obvious what the scumbag is doing and how Kayla's insecurity is making her second guess herself.  Kayla eventually says NO! (She says it firmly, but still in a way that's apologetic towards Olivia's friend, as though Kayla is ruining his fun).  Olivia's friend then backs off, but makes Kayla feel guilty about the whole thing, saying that he was only trying to prepare her for high school.  Kayla says she's sorry.   Kayla is then dropped off home and she has a breakdown from it.!<

EDIT: I just want to say that what I just typed doesn't do the scene justice.  You have to see this scene for yourself.  The whole movie builds up to it and makes it WAY more traumatizing than what I described.

When Kayla goes to the mall with Olivia and her friends, one of the guys says ""She's wired differently"" because of the early use of modern social media, and that's what many people, especially adults, would think; this usually leads to mockery towards the next or the previous generations, and in movies or tv shows we often end up seeing parodied versions of reality.

And that's where I think this movie rise over many others: the social media, the different lifestyle and different means of communication are just a background to the real focus of the story, which is Kayla herself.

And that's why so many people ended up relating with her, even if they had her age in a very different time.",945h35

I mean, his honesty and openness is refreshing if you've been getting a lack of that from other people. Gabe's probably going to mature and become a really good person, especially after Kayla helps him to relax and teaches him what kind of things are and aren't good topics of conversation.

If we weren‚Äôt Kayla, we knew a Kayla, we knew a Gabe, we knew a Kennedy, we knew the way adults were trying to awkwardly connect to us, etc.

 I think it comes down to the same issue. While it wants to feel grounded and uneventful, the scenes just feel too scripted, which both rob it of any sincerity, but also of any dramatic weight. So it‚Äôs too scripted to feel grounded, but too uneventful to feel meaningful.

e6rvpbo,"Thank you so much for hearing me and validating me... It means a lot. This happened two years ago when I was 22 and honestly it hurt more to lose my friend. I wasn't going to tell her, but he told her it was consensual and she told her girlfriend that me and my assaulter had a ""fling"" and I flipped my fucking shit and said ""NO HE ASSAULTED ME."" She never invited me to shit after that and even looked at me with disgust the few times I saw her. I tried to talk to her about it and she just told me he was one of her best friends and she heard both out sides of the story. I think she just didn't want to get involved. 

He found out I told her and he texted me and hurled abuses, calling me a slut, a fucking bitch, threatening me to keep my mouth shut. I should have reported it to the police for harrassment at least. What he did wasn't a big enough deal to send him to prison but the harrassment was really fucked up. I went to therapy for it and moved on.


 The friend (my Olivia) moved away and I got a text from her like a year after I last saw her in person, she found something that made her think of me. I always wondered if she eventually felt guilty about it once she was away from everyone. This is someone I used to do my homework with and meet at the diner at midnight and tell all my problems and insecurities to. It hurt more losing her than the actual assault.

That isn't excusing his behavior. He is a total piece of shit to do something like that, and especially to insult her afterwards and blame her. He was raised wrong and has no empathy for other people. But I think he was totally unaware of the harm he was doing until after she yelled no, then he finally realized he screwed up but couldn't escape the situation and still had to drive her home so he lost control and got angry.

He became a monster without meaning to, because he's so completely ignorant about right and wrong and what's harmful and unacceptable.

But we as an audience empathize deeply with her because she is a child - but then we have to have the turnaround realization that he is also a child.  It's an interesting realization, reminding me of when Joi talks to our protagonist in Blade Runner 2049 - ""Oh shit, she's a robot.....wait, wait, wait, he's also a robot"".  It makes you have empathy for the whole situation, and for the culture that creates young men who need to prove their worth through sexual conquest.

I think with the crush it's just a bit abrupt because one moment she's looking up how to perform a blowjob and thinking about practicing on a banana to nothing. Your point about high school guys stands as a valid reason, I just think it was a bit uneven in the execution. They should've either a) had him a bit more prevalent through the plot so that when Kayla follows him at the end and the audience is led to believe for a second she might be falling back for him it feels more possible, or b) had a scene where she denies him completely so there's some finality to it, be that at the middle or the end of the movie.

The high school girl I definitely see where you're coming from, Kayla does seem like she'd avoid the situation rather than confront it. But I'd like to have seen it. Maybe show her writing a text to Olivia, hesitating, then erasing it all. Or going to call her and questioning herself. 

But I also concede that friends are made and lost very quickly in middle/high school, so what happened works in the vein of realism, I'd just have liked to see a bit more finality from it in the vein of it being a film.

eewiy2v,"1.  was more a criticism of Kayla and less about the movie seeing as you confirm it‚Äôs realistic.

2. Kayla was trying to force a friendship and even was very fake with Kennedy. She thought if she followed some simple rules of just complimenting a person and what they‚Äôre wearing that they should like you. Kennedy just wanted to be left alone. She was forced to invite a girl she wasn‚Äôt friends with to her birthday party. There‚Äôs no point in your life where it‚Äôs ok to try and force someone to be friends with someone they don‚Äôt want to be friends with. And while Kennedy exhibits bratty traits upon receiving Kayla‚Äôs gift, if Kayla actually had made any effort to actually know Kennedy then she‚Äôd know ‚Äúgo fish but better‚Äù was not going to be something she‚Äôs interested in. She wrote Kennedy a thank you letter, again should be obvious that‚Äôs not something she‚Äôd be interested in, and felt that Kennedy was obligated to respond to it.

I would totally feel different about her yelling at Kennedy if she had been mean to her or bullied her. She simply did not want to be her friend, and the fact that Kayla thinks she‚Äôs owed friendship by simply being nice to someone isn‚Äôt enough. Again, this is more of a Kayla criticism, and not saying it‚Äôs an unrealistic reaction.",945h35

e3wlmh8,"I agree 100%.  He's just like her, anxiety and scared.  What was unique was that the boy her age is blunt and honest ""do you give blow jobs?"" . . .but when you get older, you cannot be that blunt, so you have to be indirect with your messages and THAT is a skill he has not mastered.  He blames her for not wanted to do what he wanted, which is seen as a sign of rejection.  Which it is! But he presented his request in a non-threatening way so he's confused as to the rejection.  THEN he blames her and justifies his actions by saying ""I was just helping you so other's wouldn't make fun of you"".  Personally, I blame the other girl (Olivia?) for saying, ""Yeah, I don't think so, you drop her off or drop us both off here and I'll get her home"".  Friends make sure friends get home safe regardless.

e3o7gaj," it's specifically what he said about trying to make her experienced so she can be good with the next guy but now will only dissapoint. People can project their own problems and insecurities onto another person. As a guy myself what he said rings truth. Guys masculinity is associated with dick size, media ridicules male virginity. Heck, look up ""being a virgin"" and see how the ratio of women spreading positivity to women to men discussing the topic. There are even videos asking people when they lost it an so many are women speaking because apparently thats more entertaining. Hell, look at movies like 40 year old virgin, porkys, american pie, superbad, girl next door, the late bloomer, all comedies about male virginity from a quick google search amongst many others. No one thinks that factors like this can create low self esteem in men and a desperation to feel normal and when they cant feel closure about themselves they lash. How about we talk to guys about this instead of always taking at face value the guy is automatically a piece of shit. I wish someone talked to me about it and lots make bad descions because of that. That sentence gives only a glimpse into how a niceguy or douchebag can be formed. I appreciate the fact that this little stament is said, no one asks why the guy acts like that, only that he is a dick for doing so. His actions are bad, but there is sad truth behind it.",945h35
e3o3cwg,"Pressure =/= rape. When was the last time you've ever heard of schools properly educating male students about consent and the different kinds other than hearing a straightforward no. women are taught how to be upfront and clear about their non-consent but peope almost never talk to guys about how to recognize different forms of consent and leaves a confused youth and situations such as one presented and they grow up to be asshole nice guys. The fact that he projects his feelings onto Kayla leads me to debate this topic, a topic never fully explored like this movie did. America highly ridicules male virginity and therefore products like this are created and the movie commentates on this by allowing him to express his own frustrations. I'm not defending his actions, I view it as a tradgey of an insecurity amongst the many others this film explores. ",945h35
e3o4333,"How? I'm not defending I'm analyzing. Is it not true that recognizing consent is a big problem but almost never discussed to male students?  Is it not true that movies like american pie, superbad, 40yo virgin, and other media highly ridicule virginity? Don't you think a combination of these issues can create confused men who don't fully understand consent and become desperate for sex just to feel normal? No movie ever shows that situation from the pov the character takes. he's not a bryce from 13 reasons why, or a biff from back to the future. He's a product of american ociety that refuses to discuss different forms of consent and woman and creates self hate within young men. His words were short but had lots of meaning, and the movie is all about exploring emotion through multiple points of view. If he physically forced himself or just kept calling her whore or skank then I wouldn't have said anything but I find what he said at the end to perfectly summarize what happens when priblems like this go unacknowledged amongst men. A viewpoint never shown before. ",945h35

e3rg20v,"Late reply, but I just saw this movie.

The thing I think Bo did so well in this scene is play with the idea of putting yourself out there. Her dad encouraged her to go to the pool party, to put herself out there, she makes a video about how it's good to be uncomfortable because that's how you grow. It shows just how hard it is for middle schoolers (or really anyone) to know, is this a good uncomfortable or a bad uncomfortable.

If that scene would've happened with Gabe, it could've come across as pleasantly, cringily relatable. Many people have fond memories of their awkward first sexual encounters with their peers that were *not* predatory. Both parties were kind of uncomfortable, but it was also exciting. And I'm sure from Kayla's perspective, this guy wasn't that much older than her, so it should be fine....until she realized that it really wasn't what she wanted.",945h35

So instead I told myself that I was promiscuous by choice, in an attempt to feel empowered by it. But the truth was that I felt gross and used.

I'm so sorry you had that experience. We talk about rape and assault, but I don't think we talk about these ""gray"" situations enough, and I was amazed to see it so well depicted on screen (and honestly, by a man). I grew up with all these movies where it was totally normal for a guy to convince or trick a girl into hooking up, and it was played as a joke.

Second, who said anything about her entire existence? The movie portrays only one or two weeks of her life at the end of her 8th grade. I can say with 100% confidence that I and at least some other equally socially incompetent kids had long stretches, even entire grades, where they did not have any friends.

back when I was growing up we didn't really have that option. even the geeks had video games which were inherently social activities. we at least sat in the same room and bullshat around w/ each other. even something as mindless and passive as watching TV was a group activity. nowadays we can all live in our own bubbles. even if we find ourselves in a physical group of people watching TV, everyone is on their own device and doing their own thing. I never thought I would be so nostalgic for something as banal as lazing on the couch w/ friends/fam, watching mindless shit.

it's harder now. socializing is something we have to actually go out of our way and make time for. we have to actively socialize, because otherwise it's so easy just to sit on our phones alone. before smartphones, we had hobbies and interests (even the nerds) that came w/ face-to-face socialization built into it.

ed7150y,"Hey, a bit late but I just watched this tonight. I didn't feel like it was full of cringe comedy, but just actual cringe moments. Sometimes I laughed at the awkwardness, but the moments felt real to me, not like they were added for humour.

I actually really enjoyed the movie, as did my wife (she loved it even more than me); for what it's worth we are both 36 and met in high school. We related to a lot of things in the movie even though we didn't have the technology showcased so much, but even though the tech was central in a lot of ways, it also wasn't as important as the characters and the feelings.

I just wanted to address one of your points in your first comment, that there was no character growth. I was actually really impressed with the character growth! I was watching it and thinking ""how can they resolve this? Is she going to stay awkward, or is she going to become 'cool'?"" and neither option really felt like a good choice.

Then we see her leave the line and start to chase after Aiden, only she wasn't chasing him at all, she was confronting the cool girl and just poured out her feelings she'd been bottling up and told her she'd enjoy life more if she stopped trying to act cool all the time. Then we see her having a date with Gabe, and she's just being herself and having fun instead of judging everything.

I felt the character growth, and perhaps the point of the movie, was that she didn't have to be scared and awkward, but she also didn't need to be cool, she just decided to relax and be herself which made her a much better person than either of the two extremes.

Anyway, just my thoughts.",945h35

But a person's maturity level does change. There are so many stories of people who were bullies in high school, thinking it was just harmless fun, and then a few years later they realize how much of an asshole they were and that what they did wasn't OK at all.

My impression is that the guy in the movie falls closer to that category than being a psychopath and future rapist.

EDIT: updated with better links and explanations of someone who is introverted.

What is introversion? In its modern sense, the concept goes back to the 1920s and the psychologist Carl Jung. Today it is a mainstay of personality tests, including the widely used Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. Introverts are not necessarily shy. Shy people are anxious or frightened or self-excoriating in social settings; introverts generally are not. Introverts are also not misanthropic, though some of us do go along with Sartre as far as to say ""Hell is other people at breakfast.""

e40e5ob,"People do mature. But I think that that level of lack of empathy... I don‚Äôt know. I haven‚Äôt ever personally followed up with the guys who acted like this towards me but I know that I‚Äôve run across the pushy guy from my original post on dating sites in adulthood and gotten the chills. I feel like in this kind of thing, you‚Äôre either a caring  enough person or you aren‚Äôt. It happens way before teenhood, that stuff is rooted in childhood development and brain chemistry. I can‚Äôt imagine this guy ever turning into a caring and attentive lover in the true sense. That can be an uphill battle against socialization even for more empathetic guys. I just don‚Äôt see it. 

Yes I think that we all do dumb things as teens but some things do speak to the core of a person. I think it‚Äôs a scale and it depends on what they actually did. Some people mature. Some people mask it more. But it‚Äôs hard to hide during intimacy.

I don‚Äôt think that he was a psychopath or a rapist. My rapist was a psychopath and I‚Äôve encountered a few others- one harassed me for amusement, and the other would mostly get money out of people but also would lure younger women online into relationships to fly cross country to meet him then leave them waiting at the airport for fun. My experience has been all type 1-ish so I don‚Äôt know about the other types as much. The only part of the movie kid‚Äôs behavior that would seem psychopathic is not caring that she was uncomfortable or young + the irritation/snapping at her for not going his way (they love control) but that whole situation would have gone differently if he was one (it‚Äôs not about what they do, but how they do things, they‚Äôre made of ice under the mask. It‚Äôs likely her discomfort would be pleasing to him, for example, though not necessarily- blending/hiding is their bread and butter. And some find any hesitancy just annoying) But the guy is coercive. And empathy is a scale, psychopaths are just the extreme. If you ever take a psychopathy test it‚Äôs a score and they are just on the far end. I think the average is in the middle. I end up pretty far on the empathy end. Rape is an extreme, but coercive behavior is a spectrum. The vast majority of guys won‚Äôt rape but maaaaany like to push it right up to the line of legality. Which is still violation. Also just to mention but psychopaths can be popular and have ‚Äúclose‚Äù friends, they marry, etc. I mean look at Bill Cosby. Also, most rapes are committed by non-psychopaths, since they are only 1% of the population (though they account for up to 50% of serial rapes in some estimates- a lower number for all rapes when you include non-serial, although most rapists are serial. And psychopaths are highly prolific and lack fundamentally understanding of what rape is just like the rest of society but even more so)",945h35

e3m3psm,Maybe only every night before I have to wake up at 5 am for my 10 hour work day,945h35
e41stxr,"In the moment she definitely felt that way. Things were going wrong and the guy got mad and she felt like it must be her fault, she expects any social problems to be her fault by default, and him being angry and not taking any blame put her into assuming the blame must be on her. By that I mean if he backed off, apologized, explained he thought she was interested and he made a mistake and is so sorry, etc. then she wouldn't have fallen into that mindset where she assumes something was her fault.

But I think it's different the next day once she has had time to think it over. By then I think she would be mad at him and never want to see him again due to him creating that situation, even if she does still put some blame on herself for not handling it better.

I think what it boils down to is how much she values being friends with Olivia vs how much she wants to erase that night from her life. Maybe she just wants to never think of any of that again, which includes cutting contact with Olivia. If she wants to stay friends with Olivia, it's inevitable that she'll run into that guy again if she stays quiet, so staying friends means telling Olivia (or at least telling a watered down version like ""he hit on me and it was weird so I don't want to hang out if he's around"").",945h35

Fair point, I see what you mean.
