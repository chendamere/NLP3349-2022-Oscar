I expected there to be a slight emotional beat here, whether it be a pause, or a look or something. But Louise answered a pretty straightforward ""No."" I thought to myself at the time, that's interesting--not sure I totally understand Amy's decision to be so stoic about her character's past there.

I was riding in the car home and it just hit my brother and I that the two heptapods *knew* there was a bomb in their ship. They knew how long they had left, and when Louise and Abbott write on the barrier together, Costello ""swims"" away.

This is because solving algebra is linear whereas calculus and up requires a wisdom that spans multiple ""dimensions"".   
I cheated because I read the book first so I knew what was going on beforehand but this little detail was something that I appreciated for its subtlety. The book proposes that the difficulty levels of algebra and calculus are switched so that for humans, learning algebra to calculus is easier whereas for the aliens the opposite is true (interesting to wonder what process they use to learn how to communicate with humans as ours is on a linear time frame).

d9vclxk,"Just got back from a 7 PM show and here's the short version: A beautifully shot film gives way to an even more beautifully told story that becomes so much more than your typical alien invasion movie. If you're a fan of sci-fi or great movies in general then you owe it to yourself to see this.

It isn't often that I say to myself ""Damn, that was a really cool shot"" mere minutes into the movie but I certainly did that tonight. Villeneuve strikes again with his usual great cinematography and a fantastic musical score accompanies each scene seemingly perfectly. It's not often musical scores stand out to me but this one certainly did. Film is at its core a work of art, and Arrival certainly qualifies in that regard.

The pacing does get a little slow in the second act, but it's required for properly displaying the monumental effort that it took to learn how to communicate even on a basic level with the aliens. The movie does a great job making both viewer and actor feel like they're learning together and that really helps with the immersion factor. Things are just open ended enough as to where you don't really know the aliens' true intentions right until the end so it keeps you guessing as to what they really want here. 

The final sequence of the film left very few dry eyes in my theatre and this is quite possibly the highlight of a fantastic score with violin that perfectly fit the mood, capping it beautifully. You owe it to yourself to experience this in the theatre as was intended. ",5cc7fb

Using this language, humanity will be better, stronger, and United. 

They are doing this because in 3000 years they (the aliens) will need humanities help. 

Am I understanding that correctly?

Amy Adams is the only one who knows how to think with time travel at the moment. Am I to assume that once you understand the alien language, you will be able to think with time travel as well? That is, they are sharing this tool with all of humanity if they study it, not just her. So this ""gift"" won't die off when she does?

That aside, the theory behind how we'd approach first contact and how the relationship between language and thinking would influence this meeting was absolutely thrilling to watch. The intrigue I felt watching it was something I haven't felt in a very long time.

d9wzd1r,"This film explores some scientific and philosophical themes:

[The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) (Also referred to as ‚Äòlinguistic relativity‚Äô) is a paradigm in linguistics and cognitive science, suggesting that a learned language will physically alter the speakers‚Äô brain in such a way that the specific structure of the language will bring about particular changes in cognition, and ultimately how one views the world.

[Eternalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternalism_(philosophy_of_time) is an approach in the philosophy of time suggesting that all moments (past, present and future) are equally real; there is nothing special about the present. This view is opposed to [presentism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_presentism), which states that only the present is real, that we only exist *now*. In Arrival, human languages typically lead to their speakers becoming presentists. We tend to think of past, present and future as being separate categories in time with a unique asymmetry, where the past is set in stone, the future is open, and the present is where change takes place. In contrast, the Heptapod language is one that demands a non-linear view of time, where all moments exist equally, and therefore speakers of the Heptapod language tend to become eternalists. 

As an aside, eternalism is the better supported approach. It is supported by empirical findings, such as those that are a consequences of the theory of special relativity. There is no absolute reference frame, or no absolute present moment. Two or more observers may disagree about what event is past, present or future, given their relative state of motion, yet all observers will agree on the ordering of events, event A can never come after event B (but it can be simultaneous with B).

For the Heptapods (and later Louise), language is primarily [performative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performativity) rather than communicative. The Heptapods (and later Lousie) are [prescient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precognition), and therefore have knowledge of events before they happen (from the perspective of a human who has a linear perception of time). So rather than trying to communicate with humans the Heptapods are using language as a source of action: They use it to give Louise ‚Äòthe gift‚Äô so things move according to the plan. However, things are not moving according to anyone‚Äôs plan--not Louise's or the Heptapod's--they are moving according to the universe‚Äôs plan: all creatures are merely conscious observers, following their scripts and acting accordingly. Costello could not avoid his death, nor could Louise avoid her husband‚Äôs divorce nor the death of her daughter Hannah. 

[Determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism) and [free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will). Given that both the Heptapods (and later Louise) have knowledge of the future, they, by definition, cannot change what will happen, given that it is not knowledge if they can change it. So I believe Louise was unable to alter her future, instead she learned to accept the necessity of events that transpired. Additionally, I believe that by learning the Heptapod language, part of the change that takes place in one's way of thinking, *is* this acceptance of the necessity of things. So where does free will come into this? Despite everything being determined, free will merely describes actions that are consistent with our beliefs and desires. To make a choice then, is for an agent to act in accordance with their beliefs and desires, even if those beliefs and desires are ultimately determined. Therefore, even though Louise knows what will come to pass, she still makes choices, given that what she does is what she wants to do. She *wants* to have Hannah and she *wants* to marry Ian. This acceptance of both free will and determinism is referred to as [compatiblism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism).",5cc7fb

d9vbzsc,"I think this might be my current movie of the year. I dunno I think of the movies I've seen that are up there so far. Midnight Special, Green Room, Swiss Army Man, and none of them wrecked me emotionally like this movie did.

You can tell it's Villeneuve behind the camera. His sequences are so deliberate and they take their time but are never boring. The sequence of the first time they go to visit the aliens was just great.

Amy Adams is so fucking legit in this movie. She's an amazing actress but the amount of emotional impact I got from her actually took me off guard. Everyone else is just fine but Adams is a real bright spot. She is the entirety of the emotional core and she sells it perfectly.

The aliens and the language lessons were great but what really took me by surprise was the emotion and the ideas of non linear time and the question of which choices you'd make if you knew how they'd end. This is really great sci fi. Go see it if you're on the fence.",5cc7fb

d9vdk95,"The apparent fact that the relationship between Louise and Ian was not so much to inject romance/melodrama into the film to humanise Louise, but to explore so many things about humans, logic and destiny was both emotionally and intellectually rewarding above and beyond so many films of its kind.

I love that the war aspect didn't drive the film more so than Louise's personal curiosity, empathy, persistence and unusual mind construct. Those things led to her breakthrough rather than arrogance, cavalierness, desperation, convenience or fear. Things which I think negatively impact on many other dramas that use those more 'hysterical' notions as a character crutch. It's a triumph for female characters in film.

 It's also clear that the story is the true champion here, but Villeneuve is among a small group of masters that understand and respect the power of story/the writing itself. Performers and directors who can smartly couple story with a restrained, undistracted vision of the most important things for an audience to see and feel. Not by tanking what would be a very complex emotional journey by employing a more fear-driven death and destruction narrative path that's so common now with upcoming directors. It seems the young directors fear for us, the wiser ones help us consider fear itself.",5cc7fb

I'm honestly just happy that other people can enjoy this film now. That's what I'm most excited about.",5cc7fb
d9yk4b9,"Kurt Vonnegut explains the time elements of the movie:
>The creatures were friendly, and they could see in four dimensions. They pitied Earthlings for being able to see only three. They had many wonderful things to teach Earthlings, especially about time. Billy promised to tell what some of those wonderful things were in his next letter.
>Billy was working on his second letter when the first letter was published. The second letter started out like this:
>The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present and future, always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just that way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever.
>When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in a bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is ""so it goes.‚Äù ",5cc7fb
d9x0047,"At first I attributed the quirky phrase ""Abbott is death process"" as a incorrect translation, or maybe it's just cause English is his second language, or limit vocabulary.

But the more I thought about how these aliens exist and experience reality. The more the line made sense exactly as he said it. Death wouldn't be a final thing. He isn't really dead, since he experiences time nonlinearly. ""Death"" would just appear to be another state of being for them, a process they can go in and out of. Costello can simply go back and talk to Abbott. 

Costello has simply gone beyond the range of Abbott's time loop. But Abbott isn't really gone to him. As such Abbott didn't fear going to his death, he really isn't going anywhere, it's just that Costello is going beyond Abbott's reach, but will return momentarily.

Death is just a temporary process to them.

At least that's what I think.",5cc7fb
d9vc1op,"I left my seat speechless. What an AWESOME movie. Couple of things I'd like to discuss:

What is everyone's thoughts on the philosophy behind the idea that she knew her (their) future, but still went through with it? Why would she do that if she knew how much it would hurt?

Also, I know it's not important to the plot of this film in particular, but I'm so incredibly curious as to what the Aliens meant when they said that they will need humanity's help in 3000 years.

edit: I really don't think I could make the same choice that Louise makes. I understand it, somewhat... But I don't think the pain would be worth it, not to mention it's incredibly selfish of her to put Ian through that.

edit 2: I forgot to mention. I could not stand how the military was so unresponsive and wanted to rush what Louise and Ian were doing. Every time they asked ""what did they say?"" I wanted to throttle them. Then I realized... it's probably realistic.",5cc7fb

d9y8z1m,"This movie is really positively recieved so i hope I can get some good discussion about what's wrong with it. 

It does a lot of things extremely well, which has been covered extensively, but I think the premise of its ending doesn't address the much more interesting questions and themes that appear to be introduced in the movies first acts, which is a big problem for me. 

The first 2/3 or so of the movie basically seem to explore the questions of how humanity would realistically react to an event like this, and how would it be possible to communicate with an alien with practically no shared frame of reference. These are both really interesting questions on their own that I was excited to see addressed in some meaningful way. 

Are our warlike instincts an inescapable part of who we are? Can we as a species ever overcome this part of us or are we doomed to be destroyed by it? The movie asks this and then answers ""yeah, if we figure out how to see the future"". It felt like it was dodging rather than answering the question, which i thought was an interesting one, especially right now. 

We also have the problem of how to communicate with a being without being able to assume that it shares any of our sensory or mental characteristics. This is explored a little (""do they even understand the concept of what a question is? Do they have a concept of an individual with a name at all?"") But then glossed over by convenient giving the aliens a lot of similarities to us (the ability to communicate with a visual language, and a spoken language which both happen to be in a range we can see and hear). This is a really cool problem, and I wish it had been explored a lot more, but it seemed half explained and we just sort of skipped forward until we could basically communicate with the aliens pretty well. 

It felt like amazing ideas were set up, but then the writers weren't sure where to go next, so they introduced this non linear perception concept even though it introduces a lot of problems into the story, like time travel sort of stuff always does. Why did the aliens let one of them die if they knew a bomb was going to go off? What about the paradox of the general knowing to give her the phone number because she called him with that phone number that she learned because he knew to give her the phone number? I guess this gets into ideas about free will, predestination, and things of that nature, but these ideas weren't explored very much in the opening parts of the movie, which did a great job of exploring believable sci-fi concepts in a grounded way. It felt a bit out of place to me to suddenly get much more theoretical and abstract when I really liked how *real* the opening acts felt. 

To summarize, I loved the initial premise and hoped the movie would go somewhere equally thought provoking with it, but felt that none of those concepts were really explored and the ending felt like it went too far away from what it felt like the movie originally wanted to talk about. 

A few other unrelated thoughts - the ending ""twist"" was really hammered into the ground for like ten minutes longer than it needed to be. It felt like the movie should have ended on the shot looking out the window of Louise's house, which is the same as the opening shot, which would have ""closed the loop"" perfectly and not made me feel like i was being beaten over the head with the twist. 

Also, this movie seemed to follow Sicarios format of a weak and fearful female protagonist surrounded by strong male characters. It made more sense with Sicarios central concept, but was just distracting here. 

There were also a number of lines that really fell flat, especially from the kid. I guess kids are really hard to write properly. And ""the most surprising part wasn't meeting them...it was meeting you"" was a huge eyeroll. 

This movie did a lot right, but in the end I was disappointed mostly because it started off so damn well.",5cc7fb

Denis Villeneuve may be the most talented filmmaker on the planet right now. The way he taps into human emotion just seems to be on another level compared to other directors at the moment. I feel like the Blade Runner franchise is in good hands.

Also, I'm not sure I've seen this mentioned anywhere yet, but there are some major similarities between the Heptapods and the Tralfamadorians from Slaughterhouse Five. Extraterrestrial beings who perceive time in the fourth dimension and take an active interest in human life? Maybe I'm off base, but that's all I could think of once I realized the time-shifting aspect of the film.

d9wx6x7,"For anyone wondering how the ships worked:

Imagine Flatland. A 2D world that exists on the surface of a pond. There are little 2d creatures who can see in 360 degrees around themselves, but they have no concept of up towards our sky or down into the water. There is only x and y directions, they can't picture a z direction. Everyone they see looks like a line, but they can determine each others number of edges by feeling and observing as they circle each other. They have to watch out for triangles, those pointy angles could kill.

One day you find flatland in your pond. You speak and they hear you. You dip your finger into the water and it pokes through their world. To them it materializes out of nowhere as a circle, that grows in size. 

Extrapolate this concept to our world as flatland. They saw only a circle when we visited with a finger. I wonder if all 12 ships arranged together form a sphere. If those being could also exist outside time the way they talk about it, they might have dived into a great tapestry that stretched from big bang onwards, and materialized in our world. Perhaps they saw something 3000 years ""to the right"" of us on that painting of all space and time.

I believe this is why the ships sort of dissolved out of sight. It wasn't teleportation or instant acceleration to light speed. They were drifting out of our time, kind of like the finger withdrawing from water's surface.

Edit: You can take the idea further to explain more of the ships behavior too. Imagine the 2d world was on the side of a hill. The flatland citizens feel gravity in one direction. They have to use tools and their own bodies to climb and pull their way upwards. Once they get up to a 2d house they can rest easy inside it on the floor since it holds them up. If you inserted your finger it would hover in place with no floor to stop it sliding down the slope. They could take measurements around your finger but be unable to detect what was holding it up, since the forces anchoring it are outside of their space and comprehension. Sound familiar?",5cc7fb

So the sketch ""Who's on first"" is an absurdist comedy version of the communication  method and perception of time that the aliens and eventually Louise possess.

[What if the problem the heptapods are facing in 3000 years from now is human invasion of their planet? and they came here to teach us their way of thinking so we become like them and be peaceful?](#spoiler)

[We see in the visions of Louise how the heptapod language is taught and how the symbols have a central position in all aspects. The scene were Louise speaks with the Chinese General, the symbol is in the center of all the flags, Louise is teaching the language in the university etc. The symbols and their philosophy gain a central role in human life.](#spoiler)

[That's why they are so harmless against humans, even when they are attacked, because they know, that even if they lose some, in the end they will teach us how to think correctly. They could retaliate, or they would start eliminating human kind in the first place, for their safety in the future. But their way of thinking is that they will try to make us change our way of thinking, so they win their survival and we win their superior way. a win win situation.

d9vcesy,"This felt like Steven Spielberg meets Stanley Kubrick meets Terrence Malick directed the shit out of by Villeneuve. It hits similar thematic beats to Interstellar but does it so much better. Amy Adams absolutely carries this film, amazing heartfelt performance, and the rest of the cast stacks up really well too. A wonderfully ethereal score by Johan Johansson, the cinematography from Bradford Young was terrific, and I thought the production design was beautiful and unique and fresh. There are a couple of sequences involving the alien ship that are just riveting.

This felt like everything I could have hoped for from a smart science fiction film. I loved the way things unfolded, but just to confirm as to my understanding, when Louise understand the heptapod language, her understanding of time and her perception of it changes (perhaps alluded to by the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis regarding how language affects the way you perceive and understand things). As her perception of time changes, she's able to see the future and is able to reconcile tension with the Chinese, and also sees her future with Ian, the daughter they will have, and what will become of her (which is presented earlier in the film as if its a flashback). She decides to move forward with her future because it will bring her that happiness which she wouldn't want to give up for anything else. I don't know if that makes much sense but would love other's opinions.

Anyways I fucking loved this movie. Maybe I'm just a Villeneuve fanboy, an Amy Adams fanboy, whatever. I could see the flaws some people had with this film but everything just worked for me on an emotional and intellectual level. One of the best sci-fi films I've seen, and prolly one of my three favorite films of the decade period.",5cc7fb

It requires thought and serious reflection to understand the implications that this movie posed.

Also it's amazing how the director can convey so many emotions with the right choice of expression & sound. We're able to understand such a complex realization as the protagonist herself is realizing it! The tense tapping on the glass to warn and then eventually push them away as the explosion happens. So great.

I loved it! Definitely one of my favorite sci-fi movies ever. The emotion I felt, as the end unfolded, was so unique. Felt connected to this film through & through. Poignant is the perfect word for it.

So the consensus is that the death of her child happened once right? They're just scene cuts and the husband she divorces was the phyicist?

Edit: **Second question,** did one of the Aliens die because of the explosion, as it didn't immediately go away from the glass...?

d9za8tq,"I saw the movie on Friday and the more I think about it, the more I love it.

I feel like watching the movie was kinda like learning a new language. We start watching the movie, interpreting the scenes with the kid as flashbacks, because that's how storytelling usually works. That's how we know time works. It's linear. 

But the further we watch the movie, the more we learn about the aliens and the language, the more we realize that something is not like it seems. We learn together with the main character to interpret what we see and what we saw before differently. The flashbacks are actually flashforwards and we start to interpret everything we knew differently.

Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but I thought it was really fascinating. Seeing the movie kinda translated the movie into a different story than I thought it was at the beginning.

I was also pretty late to realize they're flashforwards, I only got it when she was in the chamber with Costello towards the end. My wife realized it much earlier when she told Hannah to ask her father ""the scientist""  about the word. And then she remembered the word from what's happening in the present. 

I'm bilingual and the discussion about language changing your mind and how you think was interesting, too. I switched the language I primarily use when I was in my mid 20s and it definitely changed how I think.  The first day I had thoughts in the new language and didn't have to translate inside my mind anymore was the day I knew I was going to be fluent. So I can imagine learning an universal language like the one used in the movie would actually change somewhat how we think and interpret things.

I also hope they'll release the software they used to generate the language. It'd be fun to play around with it!

Anyways, great movie. 

The names Abbott and Costello were so clever, too. Not only because the ""who's on first"" skit is basically a joke based on misinterpretations in a movie about interpreting a new language but also because the joke is circular and doesn't have an end. Much like the language and even the movie itself.

Definitely one of my favorite movies this year. It had its flaws, but I haven't thought that much about a piece of media in a while.

Gorgeous cinematography as well. I'm looking forward to the new Blade Runner now.

d9vmrwd,"I loved experiencing this movie at the theater, and can't wait to see it a second time. It only gets better the more I mull it over! Arrival and The Lobster are my favorite movies this year. 

**Theories!** I think it's plausible to say that Abbot and Costello are the only two Heptapods on Earth, sent as messengers, and they're visiting the different shells in a cycle. This explains the 2-hour sessions, because there are 12 shells and this would fit into our 24-hour days. **Edit:** Remembered that incorrectly, it opens up every 18 hours. Womp womp.

I believe that the ""gift"" was the ability to see time non-linearly, but not just for any John Doe who learns the language. Just for the chosen 12 people like Louise and Shang who were ""touched"" by the Heptapods. Yes, like others here I think Shang gained abilities as well, but not to the extent of Louise's. She can most likely see the furthest into the past and future.

**Why do the Heptapods need humans' help in 3000 years?** I think we're asking the wrong question. A better one would be: *How* will humans be able to help? If the issue is something that requires much of Earth's knowledge and resources as a whole, it would help immensely if everyone could speak the same language. Also if it's a complex issue, being able to converse easily with the Heptapods would be crucial. 

**Why were there 12 shells?** Louise was given the language as a gift/tool so that she could teach it to others. Her book's title, ""A Universal Language,"" led me to start wondering about how the non-English-speaking world would learn. I'm no linguist and I can't remember most of the 12 cities they landed in, but I THINK it has something to do with 12 major language groups. 12 people including Louise were given the gift so that they could teach their people the Heptapod language. Imagine what the world could do if we all knew a common tongue.

I could watch a whole sci-fi movie consisting of scenes like the one in Arrival where Louise explains [the surprising complexity of teaching an alien to understand the sentence ""What is your purpose on Earth?"" They need to understand what a question is, that 'your' is a pronoun referring to specific entities, and also whether ""your"" refers to ""Joe Alien"" or actually the collective species of aliens that have come to Earth, etc.](/spoiler)

Also, I've been re-listening to the soundtrack on Spotify (it just came out today). Johann Johannsson knocked it out of the park. They're all so good, but ""First Encounter"" is just panic-inducing. It's got the three-note horn blast that repeats several times, and each subsequent time, you have a greater feeling of dread, partly because it drops to near-silence after each blast, and you know the next one's coming. It pummels you down with its simple repetition.

My one complaint is that I think this movie is too dark (in terms of brightness, not ""depressing"" dark). I felt like I was wearing sunglasses in the movie theatre for the first third of the movie.

What a fucking badass line, idk why I love it so much.",5cc7fb
dga5efp,"***SPOILERS***

I think a very unspoken theme of the whole movie was fear, and how it forces us to make stupid decisions in the name of survival. I believe fear hampers the speed at which our species advances, because at times we choose to make rash decisions that might seem to benefit us in the short-term with no consideration of the long-term repercussions.

The aliens in the movie, due to their perception of time, seem to have overcome fear. The ability to know what will happen takes away all fear, and allows for considered, and better, decisions to be made. 

As just one of many examples, had Abbott been fearful when the bomb was about to go off, he might have chose an option to save himself but kill Louise, which would have set in motion a terrible and devastating series of events. 

My biggest takeaway from this movie is that if we are to truly advance as a species, we must overcome our fear of not only the great unknown, but of each other. In order to set aside our differences and work together towards a more common goal, we must not fear that our fellow man will stab us in the back, and not act on our instincts to protect ourselves above all else.

d9z53ns,"A few thoughts/theories that came to mind after seeing the movie:

1) I think the ""help"" the Heptapods needed from us in 3000 years is not actually help. In the movie we are depicted as a rather war-hungry species, with methods to decode their language being win/lose oriented, half the world wanting to go to war upon their arrival, and even our own soldiers that tried to bomb the ship. Perhaps in 3000 years our species has mastered interstellar travel, but when we discover their planet our first instinct is to fight the Heptapods. Maybe learning their language helps change the way we think, and therefore in the future we no longer go to war upon meeting them. In effect ""helping"" the Heptapods in the future. 

2) There is a lot of confusion from people about the importance of the line ""ask him what the sanskrit translation for war is"". I think the answer was irrelevant. Louise had a tendency of bullshitting people to get what she needed (the Kangaroo story), and I think this was just another way of her character leveraging ""sounding smart"" to get the job. 

3) It annoyed me how quickly Louise went from needing the ipad translator to know what the alien symbols meant, to having full unaided conversations with them in the final scenes. After thinking about it, I figured the same way future memories and knowledge were seeping into her mind to aid her (e.g. the general's private phone #), her future years of study and dedication to write the ""Universal Language"" book actually started creating a feedback loop going backwards in time, allowing her to more easily learn the language in the first place. 

4) Maybe obvious to some, but at the end after the final montage, the screen flashes ""ARRIVAL"" -- showing how another interpretation for the movie's title is actually about the CHILD's arrival.

dftbfiw,"Just watched the movie for the first time and I'm happy to say it lived up to the positive vibes I've encountered revolving around it.

While I see many comments fretting over the time-perception bit (which is silly because this is sci-fi, so they're obviously overthinking it), my major takeaway is:

* non-zero-sum games

Life often encourages us to view situations as zero-sum games under the guise of being realistic but under closer inspection usually feels cutthroat. It is far more heartwarming and encouraging to think of life as a non-zero-sum where we can all reap benefits.

A realistic modern first contact with aliens is the perfect scenario to explore this concept as it pits humanity against a clearly superior opponent. Even the most aggressive personalities are forced to reconsider their approach. 

The non-linear-thought concept was an excellent finale. Once you get past trying to resolve the paradox, it simply encourages foresight. This movie leaves you wanting to be smarter and likely thinking smarter already as a consequence - by looking more for win-win scenarios.

Definitely a movie for the personal collection. *It lights up my brain in ways I find similar to 'Gravity' and 'Her' from 2013...*",5cc7fb

Everything was perfectly balanced. Amy Adams was a revelation, as per usual. What an incredibly underrated actress. I felt this movie parallels her 'Junebug' acting, in that they are both realistic and earnest portrayal of a PERSON. At no point, to me, does she feel like merely a character or a plot device. She feels very human. 

[This movie also does a better job than any I can think of in it's portrayal of time as a non-linear dimension. It was very cleanly executed and wasn't leaned upon exclusively to drive the plot, which is refreshing. Additionally, the tenseness in the movie we feel over Adams is such a clever and subtle manipulation. Throughout the movie we are sympathetic and hurt on her behalf, an apparently grieving mother. We are manipulated into projecting depression, loneliness, and loss onto her before we realize it hasn't yet happened; and yet even when we realize that ""future"" Louise will undergo the loss of her child we are still rendered sympathetic by the newfound understanding of time.

d9xyq53,"The title of the book that she later writes about her experience with the aliens, The Universal Language, reminds me of a conversation I once had with someone about the difficulties of alien communication. There are attempts like, Contact, that portray Mathematics as the one universal language although it would be an extremely slow and cumbersome process. Some scientists and philosophers posit that communication with a truly, truly alien intelligence would basically be impossible, and that all our movies and television and books etc don't  really convey this. I've always felt that the closest thing that portrays this is in this scene from the game Mass Effect:

[Music](http://youtu.be/AN8k0iN0Mow)

Anyway, this person told me that if an advanced alien intelligence could somehow enter into someone's mind (and that's a huge leap you'd have to make) and see and feel from our perspective it would solve multiple, huge problems regarding inter-species communication all at once. Thus the true universal language would be done through a species' own unique perspective, and that for humans, our true *lingua franca* that everyone in any culture understands and uses somewhat (at the very least in dreams) is narrative.

d9vl1bg,"Great film. For those who don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs an adaptation of the short story ‚ÄúStory of Your Life‚Äù by the talented author Ted Chiang. Chiang‚Äôs work is very highly regarded in the SF circles, and he is known for his talent of combining high concept science fiction with a very humane intelligence. His work is suffused with a calm compassion and precision. Villeneuve‚Äôs biggest accomplishment here is that he managed to translate both these qualities ‚Äì high-brow SF and compassion ‚Äì to the big screen.

The cinematography is a highlight of the film, as it always is in Villeneuve‚Äôs films. The camera often follows Dr. Banks, the main character, from the back, and tracks her as she is walking towards things that are as yet unseen. As if she is walking towards an unknown future. The camera sometimes deliberately withholds information to raise the tension, and then slowly pans to let us take everything in. And the effective sound design! The droning rhythm of the helicopter and the muffled sounds of the headphone, and suddenly the eerie tones of Johann Johannsson‚Äôs score. Also something we‚Äôve seen before in Sicario, but it works like a charm.

d9wrinf,"I just want to yell FINALLY A MOVIE WHERE THE ALIENS ARE NICE!

SPOILERS FOR DUNE SERIES AND CHILDHOOD'S END BELOW. If you haven't read them yet, READ THEM! They are amazing books, and if you liked Arrival you would probably like them too.

So, yeah, spoilers below...

It felt like the film paid homage to the book *Childhood's End* and the *Dune* series. The Childhood's End being that the aliens, of course, are suspected of possibly being malevolent. They are ugly and enigmatic. The difference being the aliens showed themselves and couldn't communicate, while the inverse was true for Childhood's End.

The aliens also said they needed humanity's help in 3,000 years. In Childhood's End, the aliens were kind of an ""Bodhisattva"" in that they couldn't reach a sort of enlightenment for themselves, Bodhisattva by choice and the Overlords by nature, so they assisted species that could. 

Dune is another obvious one. Time being nonlinear, paraphrase ""What would you do differently if you knew your whole entire life?"" is a central theme throughout the Dune series, especially in *God Emperor of Dune*. Frank Herbert's idea seems to be that we would fine it tortuously arduous. I don't know the extent of the prescience in Arrival, but it seems very similar to prescience in Dune. Also, the ""three thousand years"" quote totally reinforced my suspicions that this was a nod to Leto Atreides II.

Come to think of it, I don't recall seeing a film or even another book about prescience and its implications. It's a fascinating subject and something everyone seems to want, but don't know if how it will affect us.

It becomes abundantly clear at the end, when we learn a peaceful resolution hinges on General Shang standing down.

The aliens already knew the outcome hinged on Shang and tried to convey this to him, but he misinterpreted their references to No time and China being the first domino to fall as acts of aggression. He fell into the very trap Louise warned of.

db15ehf,"Theory: just like how Amy Adams character shared the false story of the kangaroos to support her position, maybe the heptapods shared a false future of her daughter to support their position? 

We know the time travel information works because General Shang gave her his cell number. But do we know that the future is definitive? Did we see actual evidence that her daughter, named Hannah, dies of an unstoppable disease? 

Do the heptipods know this? Perhaps that's how they need humanity, to prove that this inevitable danger they see, whatever it is in 3000 years, doesn't have to happen. 

""Abbott is death process,"" so they at least have linear lives. They aren't immortal. If they can be destroyed then maybe they can be saved. 

By the end of the movie I was waiting for her daughter to be born and be named anything other than Hannah. They emphasized her name and that it's the same forwards and back, I was waiting for her to be named Ada.

da3wgt2,"There seems to be the idea from several posts here that Louise can see the future. This is not true and cannot be true. The idea of a past or a present or a future is completely wrapped up in a linear conception of time. 

Its hard for us to give up our linear model of time because the line is the only metaphor our language has for conceptualizing time. Imagine time is a sidewalk that you are on. You stand in the present with the future before you and the past behind. Louise and the aliens have moved beyond this conceptualization. For them, time is a constant. 

Here is some narrative evidence. Louise clearly states that the alien language allows a non-linear perception of time. This would mean that time is not a sidewalk, and there is no present, future or past. There just is. Everything is happening in the moment. An example is the party where General Shang gives her his phone number and the dying words of his wife. Notice that this exchange catches Louise completely off-guard. In linear time she should be expecting that information, not surprised by it, because she's already used it to save the world. And General Shang seems to know she is not expecting it, perhaps he sees time in the same way. He literally says he was looking forward to seeing her for the purpose of giving her information that she needs at that moment. See? The moment he gives it to her is the moment she needs it. Time is simultaneous. This also explains why Louise doesn't mind that her daughter is going to die. Because in this conception of time her daughter is always alive and always dead. And remember, there is no future to change. So while you think she is seeing the future she is just aware of being in another moment. A final example is the least concrete. Louise names her daughter Hannah. She specifically mentions that it is a palindrome. The same forward as backward. This seems to be a metaphor for the alien conception of time, and a nod to its non-linear nature. 

While confusing, this makes the movie much, much more interesting. All of the flashbacks/flashfowards are actually happening at the same time.

I'm hoping somebody can help me understand one thing that happened early on in the movie, although it was never brought up again so doesn't appear to be particularly relevant. When the Colonel is trying to recruit Louise for the job and tells her he's going to Berkeley next to ask a different professor, she tells him to ask the guy the Sanskrit word for ""argument"" and what it means, or something like that.  The Colonel comes to her house late that night and tells her what the Berkeley professor said, and she disputes his interpretation. The Colonel then brings her on to the mission.

I essentially understood the exchange to be some sort of test by Louise to prove to the Colonel that she was the superior linguistics expert, but the significance of the dialogue was lost on me, and I didn't understand why the Colonel would simply accept her interpretation of the test as more correct than the Berkeley guy's.

A thought I have while reading these comments.  Everyone here is saying that her understanding the language is what allows he to see/be the future.

From the last few scenes, I got the impression that in the 18 months following the heptapods leaving, Louise wrote - not just a book but a HANDBOOK - and was shown giving lectures, essentially working on teaching the world to understand the heptapod language. My takeaway is that once you understand the language, the concept of time is opened up to you and you are able to see your life timeline - including the future. I assume that over the years, Ian would have learned the language too.

So my question is this: If he learned the language,  he would have been able to see his future too, so why didn't he know that his daughter would die??

I feel like the line Louise says about him not being ready to hear what she told him might have something to do with it, but I can't seem to come up with a good enough explanation. 

Did he just not know the language yet? And if so, why would it take Louise only months and he still wouldn't know it 8ish years later? Also, why did the heptapods have to come 3000 years ahead of time?

One of the things I noticed was the concept of‚Äîfor lack of a better description‚Äî ‚Äòwhich came first: the chicken or the egg?‚Äô Did Louise know what to say to Shang because Shang told her; did Shang know what to whisper to Louise because she called him? And I‚Äôm not necessarily looking for the answer either because this ties into the whole notion of non-linearity and circular themes of the film.

I'd like to think that Louise, in her 'consciousness,' is actually experiencing her life from both the metaphorical ‚Äúbeginning‚Äù and ‚Äúend‚Äù‚Äîat the same time. By the end of the film, it really felt like Louise reached the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù of her life, not unlike the way she described the way the Heptapods formed their ‚Äúsentences‚Äù (by starting at both the beginning and end, and meeting in the middle). I mean, if we want to go even further‚Ä¶maybe Louise experienced her life from opposite, diametrically-connected, points on a circle. Maybe it‚Äôs not a time*line*, but a time*circle*, or even a time*sphere*. Edit1: Villenueve's direction of the storytelling and editing in the film seems to have followed this pattern as well, of meeting in the middle. Also just remembered Louise's exact line from the film near the end: ""I forgot how good it felt to be held by you."" The film really played out as if Louise was reading her life, like a Heptapod sentence, and finally remembering her time with Ian (which came more or less in the middle of her life).

Edit2: I've read a number of comments on here that still think there are ""plot holes"" and a lot everyone's confusion stems from the conversation between Louise and General Shang. [Here](http://www.paramountguilds.com/pdf/arrival.pdf) is the script fwiw, and the film is also out on iTunes for anyone who wants to see the full scene again.

Really loved the production design elements. The stone-like quality of the ships, the quiet stateliness of the scenes inside, the utter alienness of the aliens, all made it seem very realistic to me. 

The opening scene was a powerful hook, to me. In such a short period, it evoked such deep emotion. The story itself promoted so many questions, none of which were answered artificially or pedantically, and many of which were never answered. It was an extraordinary film that reminded me of science fiction before the days of big effects. 

My biggest unanswered question as I left the theater was: why twelve different ships in twelve different places?  If they knew Louise was the one, couldn't have the knowledge been shared without creating such upheaval?

",5cc7fb
d9yblko,"I watched the movie tonight and read several reviews and many of the comments here to try to ground myself, but it hasn't worked. I loved this movie. So damn much. It affected me in a way that a movie hasn't before. Mostly because of themes and circumstance, I'd guess.

My older brother is dying of brain cancer. My father was diagnosed with a rare form of skin cancer, and has surgery on Monday to determine if it has spread, which it probably has given the type of cancer and the time that he has had the initial tumor. It was originally misdiagnosed as a typical cyst. 

Tonight, I chose to go to the movies alone for maybe the second time in my life. I've always had someone - a girlfriend,  friend, or family member that was willing to go with me. Tonight was the first time I didn't even ask. My roommate was throwing a party at the house. I just didn't feel like partying, so I decided to go see Arrival, since I loved Sicario, Prisoners, and Enemy so much. 

I knew it was some heavier, language-centric sci fi but I didn't know the broader themes it touched on. 

The themes of savoring every moment and choosing to experience the rewards of an impactful relationship despite the horrifying ending spoke to me for obvious reasons. In fact, I kind of lost it at the end. I'm not normally the type to weep openly in movies but it was just so connected to my current situation that I couldn't help it. Weeped uncontrollably the last 10 minutes when I realized where the plot had gone and how it made me feel about my own life. I cried hard in the theater, then much harder in the car.

The broader themes rung true with me as well. The theme that we should learn to work together despite our differences hit home following the election. The fear and paranoia of the populace and nations was great. The sci fi concepts (being able to perceive another species, time being non-linear, etc.) were really well done to me. There was enough mystery and enough explanation to make the journey seem worthwhile. 

From a filmmaking, storytelling, and writing perspective I thought it was well done. There were some things to nitpick. Some characters were flat. Some character motivations were rushed, such as the soldiers being willing to blow up an alien vessel with C4 without much build up to support it...other than a YouTube video and a knowing stare. But I'm fine with those subplots being left on the backburner to fuel the larger, more meaningful stories. 

Overall, I fucking love this movie and can't wait to see it again. I really doubt I'll have another experience like this, given my current circumstances, ever again.

ddglcgk,"Think about it this way; the main idea of the movie was that when you learn the aliens' language, the perception of time changes for you and for everyone. Put that idea aside and look at the real world. We learn programming languages, formulas THOUSANDS of formulas in order to explain little concepts just as the complicated language of the aliens. These new languages did not exist like 100 years ago and it already changed how we perceive the world, space and day to day life. Maybe in the future, we will discover such things by learning new programming languages,breakthrough in mathematics and physics etc. or maybe aliens would come and give us some scripts :D What I am trying to say the sci-fi part of the movie actually makes sense to me.

Was expecting and hoping more for a sci fi movie exploring the ideas of first contact and interacting with an alien species that truly thinks completely differently from the way we all know.

Some might think I'm just complaining for the sake of complaining, but I'm not trying to give that impression. Like I said, it was a good film I think. But a little disappointing, since going in it was a seemingly hard sci fi movie exploring ideas that we've never really seen.

1) I've been going to a small theater in my home town because it's about 4 minutes away. This little theater has been driving me crazy for no other reason than the audio is not powerful at all and there is a constant rattling noise coming from the ceiling. I saw Doctor Strange there the other day, and I said that was the last movie I would see there.

So, I decided to go see Arrival tonight at the theater two cities away. Now, usually I don't drive 9 minutes to go see a movie, but I felt it'd be worth it. I sat in the Dolby theater for the first time, and it was insane. I don't have the technical A/V language to properly describe how that theater was better, so I'll just say the screen was better and audio was amazing. I could feel it, ya know? I completely forgot what it was like to have good sound in a theater. I also forgot that it's the sound that sucks me in to the movie.

They also had dope leather chairs that had full recline control. Blew my fuckin mind...

and B) I can't properly preface this thought. I've written and erased 4 sentences now.

So at the beginning of the movie right after the part when we went through the part of her life when her daughter dies of that disease I thought, "" 'it's better to have loved and lost...' is fucking bullshit. Nobody would consciously make the choice to have that kid if they knew it was going to die so young and be so painful to you.""

Not only did she make that choice, but through watching this movie I also changed my mind and may have finally understood the saying, ""it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all.""

dazzj27,"I just watched the movie and found very interesting the use of the quadrants. The director uses the two left quadrants and the two right quadrants in a very unusual way. I noticed it in one of the first shots where Louise was looking through the window and we would normally have the actor on the right side of the screen and the window on the left, but that didn't happen.

Transitions in quadrants relate directly to time. Left to right is going forward and right to left is going back. I have to watch the movie again to notice how the quadrant use relates to the scenes, but I could see that in the room scene, when Ian is talking to Louise and that Hectapod appears out of nowhere they made a very very very strange cut, where Ian suddenly changed quadrants.

I don't feel like the question to have Hannah or not was ever on the movie's agenda. Ian left because she DID tell him about the illness. Ian's character was definitely portrayed intelligently enough to learn the language (at least eventually), especially if we're to believe that the general (not portrayed as a scientifically minded individual) was able to learn the language. With this I feel the writers were pointing at his CHOICE to live linearly. Telling him about Hannah's condition before finding out from the doctor was the 'mistake' Louise mentioned after one of the dreams/visions, and the 'I think I know why my husband left me' revelation a bit later.",5cc7fb

dd9odrx,"Just finished the movie. Loved it. Can't stop thinking (or rather, not thinking as my brain refuses to work after going too far down the wormhole of time travel). Here are my thoughts, for what they are worth:

I see it as saying time is more of a stamp. Much like the heptapod language, everything is overlapped and at once. We are linear beings. We speak and write linearly, and we experience time in the same way. To see things as the heptapods do is to see everything simultaneously. BAM! Done. Nothing can be changed because there is ""no time"" as we know it to correct things. My thought is that, then, each happening is both separate and connected. She can see each scene alone (this could be the cause of her confusion at times - like when she was talking to Shang as he gave her the number), and then she can realize that it's all past/present/future in one. 

I would have to imagine that there would be a very confusing learning curve with complete understanding of the language/time knowledge, and that escaping linear ways of thinking completely would be impossible for her as a human (and for us, I guess, as viewers). Hence the unanswerable portions, the jumping back and forth,  and any confusing cause and effect issues. How can a movie show someone experiencing non-linear time in a linear format?  Even at the end of the movie, Louise uses terms like ""beginning"" and ""end"" when describing her life. The heptapods say, ""There is no time. Many become one"" because they can think in ways humans cannot - everything in an instant. Maybe it will take humanity 3,000 years to fully adapt or evolve their ways of thinking completely to be able to ""help"" (or be helped by) the heptapods. 

Ahhh! My brain. ",5cc7fb

dgav3a4,"I noticed some people mention that maybe the aliens only had foresight and no free will or couldn‚Äôt really change what they saw in the future. I tend to agree with this because of a couple of reasons. 

One reason is that we never see Louise have a vision of an alternate timeline. For example, when Louise makes the decision to call the Chinese leader, we only see what will happen if she makes the call, not a timeline of her deciding to not make the call.

The other reason is how the aliens ‚Äúplayed‚Äù along with Louise and Ian when trying to learn how to communicate with each other. The aliens didn‚Äôt rush to letting Louise know about the weapon, or the bomb in the room. And, if Costello didn‚Äôt want Abbott to die, wouldn‚Äôt they have just closed the doors before Ivan and Louise came in after the bomb was placed? Maybe they are also tied to that specific timeline.

Also, just a side question. Is it possible that Louise never saw a vision of her daughter‚Äôs death until after they had the baby? Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I don‚Äôt recall seeing a vision of her daughter‚Äôs cancer once Louise first starts receiving the visions in the aliens‚Äô ship.

I have a question though: In that scene, what did the alien mean by saying ""You already have. You choose life"". What was the decision she had to make? What were the options? Life or death? 

I figured it could either be referencing the question she asks Ian about seeing your whole life and if you would change things or not. Or it could reference the choice of choosing her daughter to live (giving birth to her) or not.

d9vo4bf,"I really enjoyed this movie. From the beginning it created an evocative atmosphere of the mystery and eerieness of first contact, and did so in a way that built on familiar classics and added something new. The entry to the ship and the first appearance of the aliens--I felt like I was there and my mind was being blown. This movie seemed to accurately show me how I would feel if I were in that situation; the combination of terror and fascination.

I loved the concept of the language and communication. I imagine most of this is down to Ted Chiang, and I intend to read the original story now. It was a fresh and intelligent mystery to watch. That moment where Louise breaks down the question ""What is your purpose on Earth?"" left me like, wow, I love that this is the subject of a movie.

Amy Adams was phenomenal, and Jeremy Renner and Forest Whittaker were also dependably great.

For me, the ending kinda worked but also felt a little convenient and trope-y. When I first saw Interstellar, which I pretty much loved for its mind-stretching ambition and the fact that it sold its galaxy hopping consequences with an authentic emotional story, I found the time loop resolution a little bit convenient too. On subsequent viewings I was fine with it. But I was less able to accept it in Arrival. I did like the revelation that Hannah was born *after* rather than *before*, and that Ian was the scientist who left them (plus that ""talking to animals"" picture and play-doh). But that moment with General Shang approaching her and so heavy-handedly telling her ""I remember when you called me on my private line"" (to which future Louise is mystified) just rang a little false to me. *Edit:* I get that it was logically consistent with, and indeed the essence of, the Sapir-Worf thesis the movie used as a central theme.

However, I thought the ending was a little bit cheesy. All of that soft Hollywood Oscar bait stuff about ""the human experience""  made me feel a little bit nauseous. 

 [And I thought it was almost a bit deceptive, where in the  beginning, they show scenes of Louise's child and cancer. The way the  The way the film makers showed it, made it pretty clear that it had happened almost. And then only much later on, they give clues that it is yet to happen in the future. Showing the initial scenes right at the beginning were contradictory and misleading. For e.g. in a book. ""Once upon a time, Mrs. X's baby died..... (many pages later).. She realized that her baby was to die. She then asked her partner would you still go ahead with...""

(2) Given that they could [see the future](#spoiler), they wouldn't have gotten their feelings all hurt... i.e. the Heptapods wouldn't have retaliated. Neither would they have just packed up/ dissolved/ dematerialized and shipped out.

I was just watching the Screen Junkies discussion about the science aspects of Arrival, and their visiting scientist scoffs at the way the movie deals (or essentially doesn't deal) with math: [video queued to math part](https://youtu.be/LFmNhkv-qDI?t=2m41s).

My question is this: if the whole plot is based on the fact that heptapod sense of time and therefore their language is concurrent rather than sequential, then maybe it does make sense that the scientists in the movie dismiss math as a communication strategy: numbers are sequential. Maybe it's not that the heptapods don't understand math but rather that their math is non-sequential.

One flaw in this is: then why would they understand English, which is also sequential... : /

I watched the movie again and understood why it (the intro flashback) was seen as a cheap trick but the intro of the story and the flashback was narrated/told by the then alien knowledge imbued Louis. The whole movie is a narration of the past so nothing that the audience saw was happening in 'real time'. THE WHOLE flashback intro was shown while Louis was narrating. Did you guys also notice that Louis only got those flashbacks after she studied the aliens' language and made contact with them. Prior to meeting them and meeting the team she had zero flashbacks. The flashback intro at the beginning of the movie wasnt Louise having a flashback, instead it was a part of a larger flashback (which is the whole movie i think - we got fooled to thinking that the events were happening in 'real time') as Louise narrated it. THE WHOLE MOVIE was Louise telling a story.",5cc7fb
d9w77ck,I've never been rocked to the core as much as I was the moment I realized Hannah hadn't been born yet.  Almost lost it in the theatre.  ,5cc7fb
d9y4g8z,"First of all, this movie has made it into my all time top 5. I left the theater feeling like I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. It's a slow burning suspense that centers around a single concept. Just a concept and the need to understand it. The concept of time and its relationship to language and communication (and ultimately how we understand time itself).

I couldn't stop thinking about The Traveler from Tau Alpha C (Star Trek TNG) and how he always talked about time and space being an just extension of our thoughts. Consider that time at its most fundamental level is just the continual cascading change from one state (of the universe) to another in a progressive and linear fashion. We cannot affect changes to time because we exist in time and lack the tools to make those changes (much like how without a tool like a mirror we could not see our own eyes because our vision is in our eyes, we cannot look back at ourselves). But what if that tool was a concept away? There are newer theories that suggest our brains' core functionality lies in quantum mechanics and funny things happen at the quantum level. 

That brings me to the point in the movie about being immersed in a new language can force our brains to rewire itself to think in that language. The language you dream in is usually your ""primary"" language; the language you process thoughts in. It's common for someone to think of a thought in their mother tongue and then quickly translate it to whichever language that are currently speaking. But when the thinking language flips then the person's approach to thinking also changes. This point was made when Jeremy Reiner's character asks Louise ""are you dreaming in their language?"". It's at this point where we start to see that she's actively having these flashes of memory, and not some abstract story telling device. Before this point the flashes seemed independent of the current events, and seemed a lot like flashbacks. But after that question we see Louise actively have these memories, and at first her reaction to them seems to be sadness and distress from remembering, but we start to realize that it's actually confusion which in turn confuses us and makes us immediately relate to how she's feeling!

Now why did we see the ""flash forwards"" at the beginning of the movie before Louise learned the gift? Well, that's the brilliantly poetic part. Despite others commenting that this was a cheap twist or a ""gotcha"" moment; it isn't. This is by design and firmly rooted in the concept of the story. The movie starts with her saying ""I thought this is where your story starts but it's not"" (paraphrasing, I don't remember the exact quote) during one of the first flash scenes, and the movie ends at the ""correct"" chronological moment as we perceive it showing a similar moment in time with Louise concluding ""***this*** is where your story begins"". The entire movie has a nonlinear approach to itself; a theme and concept constantly reinforced throughout the movie. The hetrapod's language was nonlinear and was physically expressed as a circle: no beginning, no end. So you could technically watch the ending of the movie first, watch the ""main"" part, then watch the intro last and it would still make sense. It's a complete circle.

The last line by Jeremy Reiner hit a cord with me (again, paraphrasing): ""I've spent my whole life looking up at the universe, and at this moment I'm most amazed by finding you"" (I think I butchered that quote). This line I find so deep and cheesy in a good way at the same time. There's a whole universe that we could spend a 1000^1000 lifetimes exploring and never reach the end, but in each person next to us there's also a universe to explore. All of our thoughts, beliefs, experiences, perceptions, knowledge, emotions, imaginations, and dreams make us all unique and we all need to learn a common language to share our universe. And because we're stuck in that pesky 4th dimension we need to do it linearly a little bit at a time.

Another thing that struck me was that not a single bullet was fired (aside from that one Russian audio clip), there was no action in the typical sense, and no one running for their lives. This film was extremely cerebral. Interstellar is another one of my all time top movies but that movie had more ""applied"" science, in that there built a space ship and used it to go through a wormhole and visit other planets. The Arrival is almost entirely a thought exercise. It was all about the logic to ask a question in a truly alien language. To me that made this movie so much more interesting. My favourite Star Trek episodes are the ones that center on scientific and logical conflicts, not physical and political ones. TNG: The Nth Degree is my favourite example.

I think this movie might get a lot of negative criticism because it is too cerebral. I know far too many people who didn't like Interstellar and I know it's simply because they didn't understand it. They thought it was confusing and silly (their words).

Others have commented about the nuances about the questions asked, how they were asked, and a ton of other subtle facts that just keep adding to the brilliance of this movie. But I wanted to share my point of view and why I found it special. I've only seen the movie once so I know I'm missing a bunch of supporting facts from the movie. Aside from all of that, the cinematography and musical score were just knocked out of the park on this film.

ddlqf64,"maybe minor spoiler

I like to think the heptapods are fourth dimensional beings, but what we perceive are just a projection of their true selves. Humans can't see fourth dimensional objects, but only cross sections of it (i.e. a hypercube). So their ""spoken"" language would be untranslatable to us because we would only be able to experience a cross section of it. Presumably the medium in which it reverberates wouldn't 3rd spatial but 4th. 

This would mean there written language isn't actually shown to us but only a representation of it. When their ship just disappears at the end it would just be the projection ending. 

This theory could also account for the 3000 year thing not referring to their perception of time but ours, meaning eventually, by learning their language we will become 4th dimensional beings also after 3000 years. This goes with the theme of the movie, how language defines identity.",5cc7fb

dayeqgf,"I thought the movie was beautifully shot and directed with great performances and a wonderful score. I wanted to like the plot a lot more but for some reason it didn't connect with me. I think that this type of high concept sci fi is just too abstract to put on film. The idea that learning this alien language can allow you to percieve all of time at once is such a dense concept that it seems trivial to frame it in the perspective of one woman's choice of whether or not to give birth to her daughter even though she knows she will die from a disease. If a human really gained such insight into the universe, they would end up like Dr. Manhattan or like Cate Blanchett's character in Indy 4 (spoiler: she exploded).",5cc7fb

dcg3mn3,"I saw this a while ago but something's been bothering me. Does anyone else remember her having flashbacks to her future before she started learning the language?

That makes it feel like she just had this special ability to perceive time differently, before the aliens even showed up so she was the one special person that just happened to also be chosen to work with the aliens. 

I'm pretty sure she's depressed at the beginning of the movie, before she's even asked to help or even before the aliens show up, because she remembers a little girl that doesn't exist, and all the pain, etc that goes with it.

That said, the aliens still might have known she would be chosen anyways. 

It just seems like a crutch to make the ending work. Nobody else gets this ability from learning the language. This is a movie about a woman who can experience time non sequentially that happens to have aliens.

dchzsa0,"Aside from the excellent quality of the film, I feel that there is merit in discussing how the film portrayed the interaction between politics and science. At numerous points in the story, the protagonist's actions and intents were heavily contrasted to the intents of the general public and the politicians, where one side wanted to find a solution to peacefully resolve conflicts while the other faction was only interested in their immediate survival. I found this depiction of science vs public very accurate; nowadays, scientific funding is primarily granted to those research groups that ""promise"" to yield immediate impact. Not much fund is available to those who study science for curiosity anymore, even though historically most scientific impacts were achieved by connecting unexpected basic research knowledge from past to present.",5cc7fb

It's just speculation but why would the heptapods come to Earth seding 12 ships in different parts of the world which obviously would cause secrecy and tension between countries. The only logical explanation would be that the heptapods have a deeper hidden agenda to cause tension and conflict and then have it resolved by sharing their language so that the humans unite. That would probably alter the timeline and stop humans from becoming a problem for heptapods in the future. 
So basically the heptapods saw into the future and realised that humans would be a problem for them, thus, they conceived a plan to change that future by coming to Earth and causing tension between the countries and put to world on the brink of war, then when global tensions are at its maximum, they reveal their ""true intentions"" of gifting their language which would then unite humanity and make the heptapods allies to the humans, negating the possibility of humans becoming an issue in the future. Although this sounds overly risky and complex for helptapods it isn't the case for a species which can easily know the outcome of their actions beforehand and all it took for them to solve the future problem was sending 12 ships and a dozen heptapods to communicate with humans and teach them language.

d9y69c7,"I don't even know where to begin. 

Like the alien language itself, I wish I could present my opinions and feelings in a circular design that can be consumed in its entirety, rather than written and read linearly. 

I left the theater picking apart the issues I felt with some of the directions the movie went in, but then it slowly started to come together *brilliantly*. 

First, Linguistic Relativity, the idea that the language you speak rewires your brain. I think most of us think about language almost as a translation of our thoughts and ideas. Language is that thing we use to communicate with other people, and it's what we think in, but it's not where our thoughts come from. Those are deeper. [Radiolab does a fantastic podcast that sort of challenges this notion.](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91725-words/) The language itself gives us our ability to think. This is explained by placing a rat in a rectangular white room with a blue wall, and a prize in one of the corners. The rats are spun around in the blue room, and told to go for the prize. You would expect that rats to get it right all the time, this is easy. Because you can always tell where the prize is in relation to the blue wall. In fact, rats get this 50% of the time, and so do humans before age 6. Rats (and young humans) know blue wall, they know left and right spatially, but they cannot connect the two. In fact, by locking up the speech in someone's brain (through shadowing), they can be made to behave just like the rats (and young humans). *Language* is what allows us to connect our thoughts and ideas together. At the very beginning of the film, Ian jokes to Louise that Math is the fundamental building block of civilization, but the film seems to agree with Louise. Language is what has empowered humans to build incredible civilizations, and discover and explain the world through math and physics after. If language is what gives humans the ability to think, it is not a great leap at all to suggest that different languages cause people to think differently. I would argue that language empowers us to think about our lives retrospectively, which makes us better and better as social animals. Do you think a dog feels regret for barking at another dog, or is just learning not to do that when you scold it? Language gives people a deeper understanding of our actions, enabling us to analyze them through thought. This brings us into the second idea. 

Loops. Circles. The alien language is cyclical, without beginning and end. If our human languages are read in sequence phonetically, the heptopod language is presented and consumed all at once. In the heptopod language, there is no beginning or end to this essay I'm writing, it's just the entire thing. I don't know if the writer(s) came up with this idea, or non-linear time idea first, but they are *natural* extensions of each other. A timeless language would be thought of timelessly, and presented for a moment. This revelation is where the film went from good to great for me. This is *then* extended to all of the human experience. The narration at the beginning of the film explores Louise's human story as the life and death of her unborn daughter plays before us. This is shown to us as a sequence of events, mostly alluded to as the prologue (my group all guessed the twist, and I knew the daughter subplot going in, so this didn't win us over on shock value). The alien race teaches Louise that human languages are limited. Just as life cannot think or reason (more deeply than conditioning) without language, humans cannot view time non-linearly without a non-sequential language. This language empowers Louise to see her life beyond her present moment. She sees all that has and will happened. 

My interpretation is that the present is *void*, and that her entire life is laid out for her to live forever. She cannot change it, in truth I think her only choice is *to* accept it. If Louise were to reject her life and change something, this *must* be reflected in the future that she chooses to reject (confused?). i.e., if she rejects her life, her life should show her rejection, thus she cannot reject (or paradox). This leads me to think that, in knowing her entire life, it must be something she *can* accept. At that moment, all uncertainty must collapse into a life that this woman can live with. For this is true for all people who would learn this language. If you know everything that will happen to you, you must accept your destiny, or it is not what will happen to you and is, thus, not your destiny. If you learn this language, your entire life is in front of you, beginning to end. It *is* your life, you cannot change it. Free-will persists, Louise still actively lives her life, but with all of her experiences to inform her, not just her past memories. Her free-will cannot change the future, or the past, because she has accepted her destiny. Her destiny is formed to be the one that she accepts. That acceptance fuels you to be a better person, and fulfill the things that you care about. Abott died in the explosion, knowing he would die, having accepted it, but that could only be in his future had he been willing to accept it in the first place. The language effectively turns us into the people that we want to be, it shows us our entire life, and we can be all of it, all at once. Cause and effect is still in place, but it is non-linear. Cause and effect persists across time, cause and effect are simultaneous. 

The idea that language has empowered human civilization, and the different languages that we speak affect how we think was brilliant. Interestingly, the film does not touch on how different human languages think differently. In fact, all the shots in the army tent with all the translators makes it feel like the film believes in a lingua franca (English!). Perhaps this is just a reflection of the government though, because ultimately the film shows how much is to be gained from learning another language, how it can open your mind to new ideas and thoughts. 

Moving on to other things I loved about the film beyond what I was thinking, damn that sound design. I loved how it felt like you were always in Louise's ears. The helicopter was loud as hell, but then she puts on the headphones and the sound even deafens gradually and inconsistently to match them sliding over her ears. The memories from the ""future"" playing over her actions in real life, clearly distracting Louise from her work. Loved it. A lot of scenes were shot at night or near night, and I just loved the way they were lit. It seems like a lot of films like that ""dawn or dusk"" hour, but Arrival has a lot of scenes before dawn or dusk that are a bit darker. The lighting really stood out to me, because I could see everything, but the shot composition wasn't framing a sun coming over the horizon. I want to call it ""dimly lit"", but that sounds like a negative. It was dim because those hours are dim, everything was lit clearly though. I thought it was masterful. The shots that stand out to me are when the helicopter is swooping into the army camp with the huge Shell shown in frame, and as we start to circle the tiny army camp we start to get a huge sense of just how big this structure is. I also love the gravity sequences, where the characters jump and fall to the wall. It was *very* well presented. I *loved* the way the film hid the Shell and the Aliens from the first 30 minutes of the film. It was slow paced, and I was very concerned all my friends were going to hate it. I thought that they nailed it though. The intrigue, the way everyone was glued to TV's but we never got a clear look at what this thing was. If you saw the trailers, you had a better idea, but I loved the way it was presented. I told my group to go in blind, so even when this kind of stuff is given away before anyone goes to see it, it's important for the people that go in blind. The whole bit with the army guy listening to Rush Limbaugh was important I guess to show how the media and public reactions were melting over into the government operation, but I didn't buy it. The government would have the very best people going to see those aliens, people they could rely on to not leak images or details, you don't send your grunts, and I find it hard to believe that that guy was qualified to be there. I also don't see how they could sneak into the ship without permission from people who were higher ranked. It seemed like a cheap excuse to raise stakes. It's probably the only issue I take with the film right now. 

**TLDR:** Loved it. If you want to know why, read the paragraph that opens with my interpretation and the last paragraph where I talk about the film making that stood out to me. 

EDIT: I feel obligated to say Metal Gear Solid 5 left me disappointed with how far it fell short with a theme as interesting as language. Words can *kill*. I'm no linguist, but I do find language fascinating. I'm overjoyed that Arrival went not only as far as I wanted MGS5 to go, but much further, exploring how the way language is presented and can change perception, and how the confines of human sequential language may be limiting. I don't necessarily believe that language is the thing between humans and eternalism, but it's as fine an example to use of what language can offer that I can think of. But Kojima wasted half his time writing about vocal chord parasites instead of the impacts of being multilingual, and the genocide of languages around the world. This film satisfied a lot of my longing. ",5cc7fb
dcj5ujn,"What an amazing film. I don't know how many people share the same sentiment but I thought Louise development as a character was much more compelling rather than the alien aspect of the movie. The knowledge of your future child's death, and having the strength to make that choice anyway was beautifully sad, I honestly can't think of any other way to describe it.

df31so0,"Wife and I just saw it. While driving home she mentioned a theory that was intriguing. *Could the encounter Louise has with general Chang at the banquet have been implanted?* 

It's open to interpretation, but they take pains in the movie to show that Louise has rudimentary skill at Mandarin and yet she speaks to him fluently over the phone (of course, this could be remembering future knowledge). The scene itself is very dreamlike. In the other future-memories Louise is often disoriented because she's interpreting the context of two different presents, but the banquet is very smooth and natural. There is the notable heptapod ""flag"" on the wall and general Chang himself speaks fluent English (possibly because he, too, was influenced by the heptapods, or perhaps because he learned the heptapods language in the future).

 I liked the idea that this was an implanted message by the aliens and Chang's comments can totally be interpreted as the heptapods... I wanted to see how your mind worked... Wanted to meet you in person etc. Food for thought!

d9wyeer,"I cried. A lot. In public. I've been feeling numb for so long and I really haven't had the desire to watch movies in general but thankfully my girlfriend convinced me to bring her to this one. Oh my god... She and I sat in the parking lot discussing it for like 20 minutes. We came to the agreement that it's simply a work of art. Just raw beauty but in the form of a film (think 2001: A Space Odyssey). 


I know that all sounds melodramatic as fuck but when you walk out of a theatre feeling like a heptapod just gave you an inter-dimensional Xanax bar, you know the movie is a cut above the rest. I actually feel quite calm and happy right now because of this movie. The circular timeline element allows for so many interpretations. My girlfriend was deeply intrigued by the whole ""free will"" quandary posed by it whereas I viewed it as a metaphor for life and adversity. We choose to live because despite all the pain and suffering, despite knowing that we will ultimately die, *living* and experiencing the small amounts of good are completely worth it. I don't feel as stressed about work because I'm able to accept that suffering is an innate part of life and that I should simply be thankful I'm alive to experience the good moments. Damn I'm gonna start crying again. Gotta log off haha. 

Seriously, if you liked this movie as much as I did, go tell fucking everyone to go out and see it.

I didn't like how they had to lay everything out, for instance, that scene when Louise and the Colonel were walking along the path and she explained the whole time thing to him *really* pissed me off, I feel like it just ruined so much subtlety. Also all the explanation of how she convinced the Chinese to lay off just felt really out of place for me and not needed, I mean, why couldn't the ships just disappear once they were done? I just really feel like I didn't need or want to know more about the brass-tacks plot when I spent the whole movie much more interested on the interesting thematic ideas.

d9z9fzr,"There's a lot to go over, so bear with me. I will try to the best of my ability to help make this make this movie make more sense. If you want the Screenwriter Eric Hisserer's insight, you can read it here: http://thetalkhouse.com/how-i-wrote-arrival/ - and of course, you can always read the novella, ""Story of Your Life"".
1. Humans think of ""time"" in a linear fashion. We use ""time"" as a measurement, and communicate ""time"" in many of our languages to help describe actions in that same fashion. For example: I write this now, but will write more until I have written everything I intended to.
2. Ian describes the Sapir-Whorf concept, where full immersion in a foreign language rewires the workings of the mind to operate at the most basic level.
3. Communication with the Heptapods were limited, due to them displaying their 3-dimensional written language on a 2-dimensional medium (the see-through barrier). It isn't until Louise immersed herself into the Heptapod's world where she could experience the full extent of their language, where she makes the full journey of self-discovery. The Heptapods use ""nonlinear orthography"", as Screenwriter Eric Heisserer puts it.
4. When the human concept of ""time"" is extinguished (by learning the Heptapod's language), humans become freed from their own construct, and they can finally make sense of nonlinear time, and make peace, as well as interstellar travel possible. Going off subject, but I once wrote a short story when I was a kid where an old man only remembers his future memory, which is his past that hasn't happened, yet, but when the future arrives, he has no memory of it, because then it becomes his past memory, which is his future that had yet to occur. It's quite the juxtaposition. I believe Piers Anthony may have had a similar character in his ""Incarnations of Immortality"" series. Anyways, in ""Arrival"", the past and the future are always in the present. The ""future"" exists as a memories, much like how our ""past"" exists as memories.
5. Think back 5 years into your past. Now, imagine that you, in that 5-years past, can remember everything from that moment to your ""present"". Your ""present"" self is your ""future"" self, from the perspective in your ""past"" self. The only difference between this situation, as opposed to just ""time travelling"" back to your past, is that we don't regard ""time"" as something that can be traveled. It's just a unit of measurement, for communication purposes. However, we're still thinking linearly.
6. To think nonlinearly, you need to immerse yourself in the Heptapod's language. Louise's daughter, Hannah, hasn't yet existed, but has, at least to Louise. The Heptapod's language gave her a choice. She could decide not to have her, due to the pain of her one day dying early, or have her, despite the inevitable outcome. She could also decide to tell Ian about Hannah's future, in which Ian leaves because he can't handle his emotions. However, when Ian learns the Heptapod's language himself, Louise has no need to tell him. He knows. Ian makes the same decision as Loiuse.
7. Let's take a step back and discuss nonlinearality - which is my term for non-linear reality. The logograms the Heptapods use look a lot like inkblots. Let's say ink splatters onto the floor. Where did the ink splatter begin, and where did it end? Left to right? Center to outside? Does it matter? The ink splatter exists, regardless of where it first started, and where it last ended. At any point of the ink splatter, it exists at all moments. The possibilities become near endless, within the confines of physical limitations.
8. In linear ""time"", there is only one timeline. The future is unknown until it becomes the present, and then it becomes part of the timeline. Humans are too focused on the ""one and only"" timeline, and that timeline cannot be changed from the human perspective. It becomes limiting, and ends only in extinction.
9. In non-linear ""time"", there are nearly limitless timelines. Reality and the hypothetical become blurred. The future is known, but it doesn't have to occur. Timelines change constantly. They intertwine together, or apart.
10. You can see it occurring throughout the ""future"" memories of Louise. When she was the only human that understood the Heptapod's language, she was the only one that could exist outside the ""one and only"" human timeline. When others understood the Heptapod's language, their timelines intertwined. General Shang chose to help Louise in the ""future"", so that Louise could help him in the ""present"". Ian chose to stay with Louise and Hannah, when Louise chose to write a book about the Heptapod language, allowing others to choose their own destiny.",5cc7fb

The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, speck of dust! Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: ‚ÄúYou are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.‚Äù If this thought gained possession of you, it would change you as you are or perhaps crush you. The question in each and every thing, ‚ÄúDo you desire this once more and innumerable times more?‚Äù would lie upon your actions as the greatest weight.

I actually read the short story its based on years ago, but I forgot enough of it to rediscover everything. The message about time and determinism I thought particularly poignant in a time where a lot of people are worried about an uncertain future. The movie communicates that we only experience time in a subjective way, but maybe if we could shift into an alternate frame where time is a singularity we would be more able to accept the things in our life completely out of our control, and by doing so experience life more fully. But it also brings up that we already know the ends to our stories , death, and yet we still go out live life the fullest.",5cc7fb

d9y33p2,"I could definitely understand why some people wouldn't like this movie if they didn't fully understand it and I, too, still have some questions. 

1) I interpreted Lousie going on to have her daughter with Renner even tho she knew her daughter would die young because it was a necessary event for Louise to understand the Alien language and prevent global war. Had Louise NOT had her daughter, she recognizes that she would not have all of the flashforwards with her daughter. These flashforwards were integral in Louise's ability to identify the alien language as something that is beginning to let her see in the future and dissolve her once-linear timeline. I'm seeing people say that they thinkLouise simply decided to have her daughter because she knew she'd love her anyway even tho she knew she'd die young, etc. etc. but I saw it as Louise recognizing that if she didn't choose to marry Renner, have a daughter with him that she knew would die young, that her past-self would be missing key components (the flashforwards with her daughter) that played a critical role in her recognizing the importance of learning and ability to learn the alien language.

2) I'm caught up with this whole thing with Shang and Louise at the future party. It seems to me that Shang doesn't just REVEAL information (his private #, wife's last words) to Louise, but rather INSTRUCTS and GUIDES Louise to tell his past-self this info in order to prove to his past-self that she can see the future and prevent global war. The reason I say this is because the dialogue between Shang and Louise at the party made it pretty clear to me that Shang knew what had happened in the past with the phone call between the two but Louise did not remember the phone call. Shang says ""I'm glad you called me on my private line"" Louise says ""I dont know your private line"" SHang types his number into his phone and says ""now you do"" and smiles at her. SHang says ""Im glad you told me my wife's last words so that I knew you had been able to see the future"" Louise says ""I dont know your wife's last words"" Shang proceeds to whisper them in her ear. Basically, this dialogue indicated to me that even in the future, at a party thrown for Louise, Shang is living in the 'correct' context of that future but Louise is flashing forward in order to get necessary info so that she can flash back and use this info to save the world. My question is- How does Shang know to give her this info and demand that she use it? Does he know in 'his' present time (the time of the party in the future) that she is flashing forward to get the info so that she can flash back to use it to save the world and thus the 'present/future' that Shang is currently in at the party?",5cc7fb

dah9o8d,"I have a theory that the heptapods are not aliens, but rather super-evolved cephalopod time travelers (i.e. Octopus, squid, cuttlefish) that are visiting from the distant future earth. They need humans' help in 3000 years, in order to ensure their successful evolution beyond that 3000-year mark. The 3000 year future humans will start them on the path to evolving super-intelligence, and they eventually become the dominant life form on earth millions of years after the humans become extinct. Examples that help my theory: 1. They look like super-evolved cephalopods, complete with the squid ink. 2. Cephalopods are currently a very intelligent animal, so it's not entirely unrealistic that they become super intelligent in 50 million years. 3. Their ships are not spaceships but rather time machines. Notice that they never leave the atmosphere of earth. Even when they depart at the end of the movie, they disappear into the mist and don't blast off into space. 4. The movie is all about ideas of temporal perception and manipulation, nothing to do with space travel. There's no reason to think that they've ever even left the planet earth in the first place. 

Another thought: the time machines work more like time portals than ships. The vessel itself has traveled through time, and it allows the heptapods to hold meetings with the humans. However, in between meetings, the heptapods aren't just chilling up there in that time travel mist but instead have returned to their own time. In this way, the mist somehow is the essence of the time portal mechanism. That explains why, after Amy Adams is exposed to the mist for only a few minutes, she retains the ability to see the future in fleeting glimpses. It also is consistent with the end of the film: when they depart, the vessel shrouds itself in that same mist before it disappears.

Any thoughts?",5cc7fb
daigfut,"[Spoiler] There is a clear Christ allegory, Amy Adams as Jesus.

The Heptapods are God, Adams is Jesus, she is tested by the people (the government) and then chosen by both the people and the Heptapods to be the savior or chosen one.  The soldiers (betrayers) try to blow her up which could be interpreted as killing her, until the Heptapods save her.

2.) Why the fuck did they have Forrest Whittaker doing that crazy Boston accent the whole time? Who gives a fuck where lieutenant bumfuck who has basically no bearing on the story is from enough to change Forrest Whittaker's already fine american accent to that nonsense that just went all over the place and made him harder to understand.

3.) What was the reasoning behind them not going with the 2nd language expert guy they talked to? Amy Adams told them to ask him what he thinks word such and such means ?

Also for a movie that is all about linguistics you would figure the audio mixing would be better right?

There were also a few odd pacing choices in my opinion and some really harsh scene cuts. Anyone of the same mind or nah?",5cc7fb
d9x2hu2,"This was the best movie I have ever seen. I'm admittedly prejudiced towards this, I love sci-fi, the subject of ""time"" is my favorite for books/movies, and I love movies with more dialogue than action. All that said, this is the best movie I have ever seen. 

The screenplay is absolutely perfect. The story literally is laid out in a perfect even pace throughout the whole movie, it uses every minute to tell the story. To the point of, if you get up to pee and miss a couple of minutes, you're probably going to have a problem understanding the complete story.   There are no hokey plot holes and/or unnatural jumps in the story arc - it plods along laying out the story brick by brick until the last frame finishes it. While you can start figuring out the hook, the plot twists, you truly can't 100% get it until the credits start rolling. He  took what was an apparently awesome short story (I just bought it, going to read it now) and fleshed it out to a masterpiece. 

The cinematography is unbelievable. The use of ""flashbacks"" (can you really call them flashbacks?), the different more vibrant color tones of the flashbacks against the more muted colors of the main storyline. The pace of reveal of the alien form... they weren't fully there in the beginning, you didn't have to wait until the final act, they are revealed to a point, then revealed a little more, then when she is brought fully into their environment you see the full form - same uniform plodding pace set it all up perfectly. The angles, the odd changes of points of reference when they enter the shell for the first time, brought the audience into what those people must have been feeling, how unnerving it all would be. 

The acting was spot on. These are all good actors, obviously. They all acted out their parts perfectly. The even, plodding pace of the story needed the same even toned feeling out of the actors and how they delivered their performance. The purpose of an actor is to meld with the story, be a natural part of it, they all just seemed naturally part of that story arc. Amy in particular, as the focus character of the movie, was superb. You felt her pain with the daughter, you felt her reserved desire to be the one to crack the code of the aliens, you felt her unstoppable and exhaustive perseverance to crack that code, and you felt her peace with it all as the foundation of the story was revealed.

d9vxkt4,"There's some films that leave your heart racing towards what you know should be the end of the film and speechless at the end.  What's more impressive is a film that's about linguistics and still leaves you at a loss for words.  Denis Villeneuve's Arrival is that film.  Arrival is a science-fiction at it's very best, there's nothing illogical, it never once breaks its own rules, yet it still leaves so much unexplained as an alien movie should.  Why should we understand technology that is light years ahead of us?  Arrival is a near masterpiece with a spectacular story, superb performances, breathtaking visuals and oh, did I mention the story?  It's fucking spectacular.  

Amy Adams is my Leo.  She's been nominated for 5 Oscars for acting and has yet to win one.  Well, luckily for her I think she has another chance this year because she was brilliant.  Unlike in a lot of other Oscar winning or nominated performances, there's no one big emotional scene or moment for her character Louise Banks, and yet it's Adams who anchors the character in reality for so long.  Amy Adams disappears into the role and becomes Dr. Banks through the little emotional nuances to her trying to translate the heptapod's language.  I'll be surprised if we don't see Amy's name in the Best Actress list come Oscar season.  

Jeremy Renner is one of the most underrated supporting actors of the last decade.  Sure performances like the Town and The Hurt Locker have gotten him nominations but I don't think that the general audience regards him as one of the best out there right now.   Hopefully, Arrival turns around the perception, because although I don't see him getting a nomination, Renner was spectacular.  He provided not only a sense of minor comic belief but was a rock for Adams' character to lean on after being under so much stress.  The film doesn't work without him.

I can't go much into the story, direction and script without getting dangerously near spoilers but I will say that the way Villeneuve approaches aliens, language, human interactions between ourselves and other species was astounding.  I think the brilliance of Arrival is that although the linguistics and the way Dr. Banks teaches the heptapods to understand us and how we learn to understand them is complicated, the script finds a way to convey it in such a way that everyone can understand.  The story is brilliantly constructed and equally executed.

Technical notes:  The cinematography is spectacular.  The race for best cinematography will most certainly include Arrival, as well as set design for the Shell and the room where the Heptapods stay (that one might be a bit of a stretch).  I'm so glad that Bradford Young is shooting the Han Solo movie because now there's no doubt in my mind that it at least won't be beautiful.  As a lover of film music and scores I can say that, Johan Johannsson's score for Arrival was one of the most unique and fitting scores that I've heard this year.  Honestly, 2016 hadn't given me many memorable underscores this year until I saw Arrival.

Arrival is a masterpiece. It's not perfect, there's a few things here and there that keep it from getting there, but I don't think I've seen a more thought provoking, satisfying, emotionally driven, intellectual science fiction film in a long time.  Arrival is what Interstellar tried to be, but it actually stuck the landing.  Go do yourselves a favour and see Arrival.

d9w5mw5,"This movie is a puzzle. It's a long math equation. It's a maze. Once you get to the ending, and figure out the solution, it's extremely satisfying. The end is nothing short of a heartbreaking, devastating tragedy. The biggest problem with this film, is that you don't even know you're in the maze, or trying to solve a math equation until it's solved. It chugs along very slowly, and slowly, and slowly, and then all of a sudden...WHAM. Just like that.

The technical merits of this film are great, as would be expected. Villeneuve's films always look great. This one is a lot more toned down and subdued from previous films. Using a lot of cool, muted colors, harsh lines and minimal set pieces. The score from Johann Johannsson is wonderful. The performances fit their roles perfectly and do not disappoint. But even adding all those things up, left me underwhelmed for the film as a whole.

You will hear a lot of people describing this film as a ""smart"" or ""intelligent"" sci-fi film, which it is, to an extent. This film wants to be smart, and make you think. But ultimately, it bites off a little more than it can chew. I'm trying to keep this as spoiler free as possible, so I won't reveal the end result, but this film takes a very high concept, that is out-of-this-world and theoretical, and doesn't give us enough to fully explain it. It doesn't flesh out the unnatural world elements to this film.

There's some stark imagery, and some pretty rough CGI that personally takes me out of a few scenes. Maybe it's not rough, maybe it's extremely well done, to the point it looks unnatural. All I know, is there is a scene or two that actually looks like an animated, cartoon film. I feel like this film goes a little too strange for your normal, wide release, weekend movie-goers. I can see a lot of people coming out of this confused and frustrated with the absurdity of it all.

Overall, Villeneuve is a wonderful filmmaker that is doing things in film that not many other people are touching. He has a very distinct artistic vision with his films, that even if I'm not a fan, I can very much appreciate. We need more directors like him in the world, producing things that are original and unique, and not just pumping out Hollywood drivel.",5cc7fb
d9xion2,"To clarify, both Amy Adams AND the chinese general understood the nonlinear time/language of the heptapods. Amy called the general in what we perceive as the present and told him that ""hey, i know you now view time as nonlinear and know that your wife will die and, I know, just like you do, that her last words are going to be ""yadi yadi yadi"". The magnitude of that was so heavy that china pulled away from the attack. ",5cc7fb
d9yb4e2,"A friend of mine was confused and asked me ""Why did the husband leave Louise? Does it matter?"" and I typed out an answer to him, pasted below:

--

One of the key questions the film asks is, ""If you knew your whole life in advance, would you want or try to change anything?"". And Louise makes a decision that may differ from the audience/father, and the whole film has been built up to tell us why she made the decision she did.

This is answered quite clearly by the film by a scene in the middle (but took me two viewings to understand more clearly - since I missed some key lines the first time)

Exact dialogue from the scene where Hannah and Louise are talking about the father (whom we find out later is Jeremy Renner, but that hasn't been explicitly revealed to the audience by this point)

---

**Daughter:** (referring to father) ""He doesnt look at me the same way you do""

**Louise:** ""Its my fault. I told him something he wasnt ready to hear.""

**Daughter:** ""What?""

**Louise:** ""Believe it or not, I know something thats going to happen. I cant explain how I know, I just do. And when I told your daddy he got really mad and said I made the wrong choice.

**Daughter:** ""What is going to happen?""

**Louise:** ""It has to do with a really rare disease and its unstoppable.""

---


During my first viewing I was confused by what Louise meant by 'made the wrong choice'. What choice?

Well...The 'choice/s' Louise made was asked to the audience at the end of the film:

- ""Do you want to make a baby?""
- (paraphrasing)""If you knew how your life was going to live out, would you still live it anyway?""

In the very final scenes we see a beautiful montage sequence of Louise and Ian having the baby, a young family, Louise playing with the child, living life, being happy and sharing tender moments etc. The montage is there to basically convey again to the audience that, irregardless of the immense pain and grief we see at the start of the film - their lives were still filled with happiness and beauty along the way.

Thus Louise made the choice that everything she knew about her life - the good , the bad, and the ugly - was still a life worth living.

Yes, the child will get cancer and die young and there will be immense grief and pain - reflected in the opening scenes - but there were moments of happiness and beauty along the way (reaffirmed in most of the 'flashbacks' culminating in the montage at the end) which still made it all worth it.

At the end of the film, Louise explicitly asks Jeremy Renner if he knew how his life was going to turn out, would he do it anyway/change anything etc. He gave a wishy washy answer. The quoted scene above shows that he had a very understandable human reaction, which is: If you knew your kid was going to die and your life would be filled with pain, why would you want to have that child? Why wouldnt you want to change your life? Coming from a scientist, who didnt understand Heptapod nor the nonlinear way of viewing time - its a pretty understandable reaction. He got angry (presumably confused and frustrated as well) and left. I can imagine him asking ""why would you allow this to happen if you knew in advance"", ""Why didnt you try to change it?"" etc etc

So the father left Louise and her daughter because he thought she made the wrong choice, and that choice was to live the life she saw mapped out already. (aka do nothing , not try to change it) - and accept the good / bad / ugly that came along with it.

Jeremy Renners character couldnt have foreseen all the moments of beauty and love that Louise did in that montage, all he probably saw coming was an ominous vision of a child that was going to die after Louise told him - and like this information would do to any of us - it scared the shit out of him / made him angry that she allowed it to happen etc.

Hence the line, ""He [daddy] doesnt look at me the same way you do.""",5cc7fb

Makes me want to live my life with meaning",5cc7fb
d9y8trj,"Huh, reading over some of these comments, it seems I dislike this movie more than most. Whelp, let's get this karma sink rolling, shall we? Edit: Oh, and at least *try* and offer some refutation of what I say here that you don't like? Please?

My SO and I just saw this, and we both felt this movie was awful. By far the most overhyped thing we've have seen in years. There were just so many issues with it.

Getting this out of the way, the best things were the visuals and the initial concept. Everything looked good (debatable the scene with her inside the alien atmosphere; they've already been shown to control gravity, so it's likely a very low-g environment, so could have just been a failure to really realize that) and was largely designed well. I liked the idea of the ships showing up, landing, waiting and then people figuring out what's going on. That was all good.

I don't have much else positive to say beyond that. The story coherence was poor, and the characters and their motivations were absolutely abysmal.

The absolute most appalling aspect was the military. Every countries military. These guys were so gung-ho from the get go to start a shooting match it was ludicrous. No one pointed out that the idea of getting aggressive against a species that has shown mastery of interstellar travel and *gravity* is nothing but suicide. If they wanted us dead, they'd have parked in the asteroid belt, picked a few good size chunks of rock, and sent them our way. Or any one of a number of other ways. The aliens show exactly *zero* aggressive actions throughout the entire movie. They do nothing but sit there, for probably about 2 months movie time, doing *nothing*. Oh, and what has to be worst, **we've had first contact protocols since the 40s** and somehow they have *only* a linguist and physicist there, and they're making it up on the fly?! What the hell man?! The US only has one of those ships, not like they'd be splitting resources getting in more experts in other fields, to say nothing of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 25th, and 50th best linguists in the county working on the stuff, or anyone else. And where were the armies of other scientists trying to figure out stuff about the ship, like how it stays up there? Like I said, this is a race that has obviously harnessed gravity, maybe they should have had people looking into that. People like, I don't know, Renner's character? Maybe?

The most idiotic thing was when everyone shut down communications after learning about ""weapons"". Yeah, I have to call crap on that. Banks and/or Donnelly should have been screaming at Weber to get one of their allies (the UK, the Aussies, even the fucking Greenlanders) back on the phone so they can test their theory. That everyone would close up shop, even nato allies, that totally and that suddenly, is stupid. Like the smaller countries (again, Aussies, Greenlanders, etc) wouldn't be reaching out to the US if they felt the shit was about to hit the fan is so unrealistic it's crazy.

Character wise, Donnelly and Banks had the chemistry of a wet match. They were the defacto love-interests because there were no other real characters in the movie. They did *not* earn their romance or future relationship. Looking over the thread here, Donnelly apparently had some use in the book but was neutered here except for that one scene near the end where he points out the missing information. You could remove him wholesale and lose almost nothing, which is a terrible thing for a lead. They developed nothing with him, nothing with Banks, absolutely nothing with anyone else either.

The best example of that is the saboteur character, Marks. Geeze, I didn't even know his name before coming here, that's how critical he was to the plot. He was background, and then we got a whole one scene to give him some half-assed justification for what he does. That's it? We don't even know what happened with him (killed in the shootout, captured and court-martialed, what?). They could have got rid of him without any consequence to the film, just have Abbot and Costello dump them out of the ship and when they land it turns out that someone else (like Sudan or somewhere else ruled by a totalitarian warlord) had a case of the stupid that day and tried to shoot at one of the ships or something, and now all alien craft world wide are on lockdown and the rest of the world is panicking over retaliation. That would have been a *better* justification for the mindless escalation of military tensions we got at the very end instead of ""Ohs noes, they might give weapon to our enemies.""

Again, this is part of the problem I have with this movie's characters; they are nothing more than shallow vehicles to move the story along. There is no comradery shown amongst the soldiers, there is no interaction between them and the scientists, there is nothing. These are people stuck in the same isolated environment for *months* (again, at least 2 months by the movie's time), yet they don't interact. Does Marks ever try talking to the scientists? Find out what they're working on? Ask them anything? Eavesdrop on their work or chit-chat at mess? Apparently not, as we sure as hell weren't shown it. And that's a huge problem, when your human characters don't act human at all.

I hated large parts of the sound design. The first time they went into the ship I felt the sound track was literally bludgeoning me. Terrible stuff.

The ""twist"" at the end was badly handled I felt. You never got any solid clue that they were flash-forwards, nothing that looked out of place, no odd background details, nothing. In the 14-16 years that they took over, *something* should have changed in some environment, some piece of technology, to give us a clue. The Heptapod writing should have been around, especially in Bank's home. But we saw nothing. [Edit] Okay, the only time we really saw it was when Hannah had the Plasticine heptapod, and I did notice that and began to wonder if they were flash-forwards then, but Banks never reacted to it, so I ignored it as well.

The best time to have the whole time-disassociation thing click, to tip the balance to both the viewer and *Banks* would have been when she starts writing like they do. She starts writing, they have their conversation, then she flashes forward to the bomb going off. She realizes what's going on, the aliens see that everything is clicking, she tries to go for the bomb in a futile effort to stop it (showing that time in this movie is a steady-state, that it can't be altered, driving home the fundamental message about the daughter), and they dump them out of the ship. From them on, both we and her have an idea of what's going on. You could have her write off some of it to after-effects from the concussion, despite we the viewer knowing better. The way it was done here felt like it seriously cheated the audience.

Again, overall, I did *not* like this movie. I went into it with very high hopes. It was stupidly well rated, for one. It looked like a solid, complex, hard sci-fi movie from a very promising director. What I got was a flat, simplistic film that didn't bother to populate itself with any characters to help bring itself to life. In the end, I found it a great idea, but an abysmal execution.",5cc7fb
d9yb589,"UPDATE: Correction, no longer thinking cancer. See below.
&nbsp;

Pretty sure I've got something big. At least big-ish. Actually I'm fairly positive that either I'm dead on with it or absolutely insane. 
&nbsp;

I strongly believe that this is a movie about something very dark, and very specific. It's not something I can see a writer just coming across and randomly littering the screenplay with details about; I'm blown away by the beautiful level of detail and subtlety, but this is absolutely a story about mother and her child's rare chromosomal mistranscription that may have drastically increased the likelihood of her childhood leukemia development.
&nbsp;

Every single detail I've been able to recall in detail is relevant and relates to reproductive biology in some fashion. Every specific word, number, or image has so far corresponded with something that immediately topped my first search result if I couldn't quickly find a strong fit inside my own fractured memories of lectures past.
&nbsp;

The imagery/literary hints as I see them:

- It begins with the alien ship floating just off the ground [viewed from the angle that appears more than a bit egg-y](http://m.imgur.com/7UjKY3e).

- As the humans travel up into it, they represent the sperm slowly ascending and ""in a race"" with the rest of humanity

- The ship takes 18 hours to populate the environment, and this led me to some Google curiosity that got disturbingly coincidental. [This in-vitro fertilization site that comes up] 
(http://abingtonreproductive.com/egg-retrieval) listing exactly 18 hours as their fertilization time, and the name feels a bit too much like Abbot and Costello weren't just a silly joke as the naming scheme.
> The mixture is spun in a centrifuge, and the washed sperm form a pellet in the bottom of the test tube. The sperm wash is repeated several times. Some of the sperm are then placed with the eggs and they are allowed to incubate together for approximately 18 hours. The following day, the egg is observed under a microscope to determine if fertilization has occurred.

- I was stuck on why there were 12 ships for a bit until some microbio flashbacks reminded me that 13 chromosomal pairs are considered often without the sex pair. It was only relevant 12 in the mix, so I did my best to reeducate myself and will do my best not to say something so dumb I have to retire at 25.


  *Past this point I will be sporadically quoting from [here](http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/children-s-health-issues/chromosomal-and-genetic-abnormalities/overview-of-chromosomal-disorders) to reference reproductive genetic terminology/details. I hadn't been aware of several, but at some point I realized this movie was far too awe-inspiring in its detail to do anything memorable without a purpose, so I got a bit more educated before I started choking back some late-onset B-student tears.*


- The lead actress/actor, as ""sperm"" metaphors represent an XY chromosome structure, and 

- The appearance of the aliens could either intentionally (sort of) look like the letters ""XX"" or appear like creepy hands as a reference to the fact that
> Many chromosomes have two segments, called ""arms,"" separated by a pinched region known as the centromere. The shorter arm is called the ""p"" arm. The longer arm is called the ""q"" arm.

- The canary was the most out-of-place detail and, in my opinion, the absolute darkest. It references the lung deterioration in patients with [Osler-Weber-Rendu"" Disease](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_hemorrhagic_telangiectasia), which shares its middle namesake with the most infuriating army dude in the film.

- The bulk of the main plot's story focuses on the exchange of information: the transcription of DNA during the fertilization process.

- The aliens communicate using...
> Rings: A portion of a chromosome has broken off and formed a circle or ring. This can happen with or without loss of genetic material.

- That language, Hannah's name, and the structure of DNA all work as a palindrome: the same message regardless of which way it is read. This is how the double-helix structure appears when torn apart and placed end-to-end.

- At some point, there ""must be a compromise"", also referred to as ""not a zero-sum-game"" in a flashback. This is the net result of one gamete providing a chromosome.

- The information exchange is near to being finalized when something goes horribly wrong. The ship explodes--a chromosome deletion has happened by mistake.

- Because Abbott and Costello are indistinct in their appearance, I'm willing to bet it's all part of this amazing parallelism. With each representing an X chromosome and the protagonist (representing the X chromosome of the XY gamete), she is taken aboard the ship, and the resulting XX configuration results in a female child

- She is informed that the accident claimed a victim: ""Abbot is death process."" A whole chromosome has been lost. This one took a bit of digging to find when I started looking for chromosomal deletion disorders that fit the story properly and ~~the best I could find was a ~~c23 deletion is correlated with leukemia~~ UPDATE: Nevermind, finally realized why they're 7-limbed HEPTApods. Can't believe it took me this long, but that's the chromosome pair indicator. Brief Google of that one quickly took me out of my depth but it's been linked to the bleeding disease linked above and possibly to language disorders.

&nbsp;

Now representing both the mother and the very first cells of her child's reproductive cycle, she is aware of this fatal transcription error from the very start. She is given the future, which she can both view/use as a gift and as a weapon. She had the option and an understandable reason to have had her child aborted as an act of mercy, but *with the knowledge of her child's fate came the knowledge of the daughter that child would become*. She makes a last-minute call to stop a Chinese targeted strike in the main narrative, which seems like an apt representation for the procedure  the surgeon would would have performed if not an outright specific surgeon. In 3000 years, far away, she will still need to use this weapon as an act of compassion. She will still have to make that same, terrible decision someday. Her child will fall horribly ill, after which she will feel her father ""doesn't look at her the same anymore,"" and her mother will ask him if he would change his own future if he could see it all right that very moment. She chooses to have her daughter, but having seen/felt/known the person she will be come, it was never really a choice at all.
&nbsp;

Truly beautiful movie. I feel lucky to have caught this unexpectedly powerful thread of detail; this was the most intricately, subtly, overwhelmingly blown-away I've ever been by a film. Whoever you are, your daughter would be proud of the beauty you've created in her memory. Thank you.",5cc7fb

d9vlh9q,"My theory as to why the aliens needed help from humans is that the aliens are succumbing to their own version of cancer. This is because the alien states that the other alien(Costello?) is ""death process"", rather than stating just death. They chose the word ""process"" specifically because that implies dying over a period of time instead of dying instantly. Just like what a disease does.

This obviously aligns with how the daughter dies from cancer. Amy Adam's character states that cancer is unstoppable, so I'm assuming that the aliens are suffering from their own kind of unstoppable disease, and the only ones capable of helping are humans that are 3000 years advanced.

This also fixes the plot hole of ""If the aliens know their future, then why can't they just prevent it from happening? Why would they need help from humans?"" Since if the aliens cannot cure an unstoppable disease, maybe advanced humans could cure it.

d9wqqsc,Quick thought. Was the heptopods  written language based on her future memories?,5cc7fb
d9wvcda,"Arrival requires you to understand at least two separate technologies to maintain your suspension of disbelief. I will try to explain my ideas, but they are only speculation and not scientific fact.

First that the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis was used to describe how her perception of time was altered with the understanding of the universal language because it allowed her mind to perceive non linear time through quantum vibrations in the micro tubules of her brains neurons.

Second that the Heptopod's reality was so altered by the universal language that they were able to harness gravity to the point they could build ships and biological bodies 3,000 years in the past to transmit information to the human race. I think this is more likely than time travel to the past and also explains why the ships dematerialize when they leave rather than leaving Earth's orbit.

The love story was important because Hannah's timeline was the lesson required for the universal language to properly allow the human brain to perceive nonlinear time. Her name is also poetic as a palindrome to accentuate the nature of information and causality with the arrow of time. 

Another interesting observation is that the Heptopod's didn't transmit any electromagnetic signals between their ships because they already had all the required information from the timeline to complete their mission, and they placed their ships at key locations to excite a defense posture that would ultimately unify the human race while ensuring the loop was closed with the phone call. 

I can only surmise that in 3,000 years the human race unified the Heptipod race in the same way with the universal language by affecting their brains with the perception of time through quantum vibrations in the microtubules of their brains neurons.

I would also like to add that no human should be exposed to the full timeline and that it would be incredibly cruel to the human condition to know the future with the responsibility to preserve the timeline. This is actually the most tragic story in the movie and the most implausible in my opinion. 

Perhaps this knowledge is what is required for transhuman perception of our reality through self-organizing processes in the fine scale, proto-conscious quantum structure of reality, and the proto-conscious condition is what unifies humans with other life forms in the universe.

It could be that this is why the universal language is so critical to the proto-conscious perception of reality and I would like to make a wild guess that the Fibonacci Sequence is encoded in the fabric of this idea. It is my opinion that Phi has something to do with how mass behaves as it passes through curved space/time and expresses the emergent qualities of gravity. 

I hope these ideas help other people enjoy the movie with some of the plot points that seem impossible.

d9vj1ct,"I wish that I had seen the movie that apparently everyone else had seen, but alas I'm stuck with a film that I would've sworn was directed by M. Night Shymalan. I actually stayed behind to see who the director was and was shocked when his name didn't come up. Instead it was the guy that directed Prisoners and Sicario, which instantly made sense. This guy has a serious issue with pacing in his films, IMO. The first hour had me on the edge of my seat and was tense and eerie and then it all just falls apart quickly after that, pretty much like those other films imo. 

The story has one of the hackiest twists I've seen (hence the Shymalan reference) that makes no sense whatsoever when you start questioning the film and it's events. Why didn't Jeremy Renner see the future as well? Why didn't he know about the daughter? Why did she have a vision where she knew the phone number if she had already called him in that future and thus would know the number while she's talking to the Chinese general? If she knew the alien language at the end (but the film teaches us that there is no middle, beginning, or end because apparently time is a circle) then why during the course of the film did she not know the language all along? Why didn't she tell everyone from the beginning about her convenient time visions and reveal that she knew what was going on all along? What is the ultimate point of having a child that you know will grow up to die? Does know one else find that morally troubling in the least bit? What was the purpose of the aliens coming at all? If they need human help in 3000 years, why not just come back in 3000 years? What gives the alien language the power to time travel and why would they need anyone's help if they have this ability? I reckon it would be really tough for rival alien factions or species to sneak up on them considering they can, ya know, see the future and prepare accordingly for it. Why is she having visions at the beginning of the film when the aliens haven't landed yet? How can she have powers at this point if this crucial event hasn't transpired? If she knows that telling Jeremy Renner the truth about her powers (even though he should have them too and should be doing the same thing as her) will cause him to break up with her and ruin their marriage.......then why do it? What does that decision achieve at all for her family except the dissolution of it?

Everything that this film does, I feel like I've seen done better in other films. The grieving female protagonist who is in touch with aliens? Contact. The preachy ""we have to get along to succeed"" message? The Day the Earth Stood Still. The weird memory stuff/ heartbreaking daughter time travelling nonsense? Interstellar and a sprinkle of Inception. Midnight Special, which came out earlier this year, hits on some similar story threads as this film, but again, it think the former just does a better job. The drab, dull scenery? Take your pick. Modern cinema seems fixated on grim dark super saturated grey movies. 

I keep reading about how this really broke people's hearts and I'm just thinking...really? I can't think of another movie to compare Arrival to in its desperate ploy to emotionally manipulate the audience. The movie wants so desperately to make us cry that it ended up not making me cry, but instead annoyed me at the faux sincerity of its grief. ""Future me is totally depressed because the child that current me hasn't had yet has died and even though I know this will happen and is avoidable, I'm going to do it anyways and choose to let it ruin my life."" What does any of this achieve? What is the point of having the ability to tell the future if that doesn't inform the decisions you make in the present going forward? That seems like a waste to me. I know I'm going against the grain here, but this one didn't do too much for me.

Villeneuve is amazing at suspense. I already knew basically what the aliens looked like and that they weren't an immediate threat from the trailer but I still had a knot in my gut as they walked up to the shell. 

They also don't feature the shell super prominently either. Other directors would set every scene outside the base camp with the shell in the background. The one thing I wish is if the trailer could have not shown the aliens or ship somehow. If you didn't know what had landed at the beginning I imagine that'd be a much more intense unease.

One scene that really captivates is the introduction of the alien spaceship. It encompasses a wide angle shot and the space the ship consumes will make you feel small. The twist at the end was surprising, even though there were very obvious hints to it throughout the film. Hannah is a palindrome!

There's a short scene which sets it up (where the soldier is talking with his wife) but otherwise it came so far out of left field that it really bugged me. It just seemed like a plot device to move the story forward.

An interesting idea I had on the second viewing is that the aliens manipulated the lead soldier's memories in the same way they were manipulating Adams's and so he ended up doing something he would never otherwise do. This was all part of the alien's grand plan as they knew the bombing and suicide had to happen for their plan to work since their view of time is non-linear.

d9waomq,"The short story is also good and adds another dimension to the film, though I think the film told a better story with some actual dramatic tension.

However, the most interesting part of the short story is that it offers a resolution of the Grandfather Paradox. Say you knew what happened in the future. Why would you not choose to change it for the better having that information? If you changed things, why would you have saw the previous future in the first place? The only resolution to this is if you knew for sure that what you saw happen in the future is already the best of all possible scenarios and that you shouldn't change anything. In fact, it logically must be, because if it wasn't, you would change things.

The way the short story explained it is by bringing in the fact that alien math and physics was topsy-turvy compared to ours. We hold things like algebra, mass, acceleration to be fundamental, while the idea of Fermat's Principle is basic to theirs. That's an idea that basically implies light ""knows"" its eventual destination the moment its created at its source and will follow the path to get there that will take the least amount of time. In this metaphor, light (and a being with future knowledge) knows its future from the beginning and will thus always pick the most optimal path.

So this implies having her daughter even though she'll eventually die is the optimal path chosen by her. I thought that was pretty interesting.",5cc7fb
d9wauj8,"I have an important question about the movie, but I don't want to read too many spoilers, so I'm hoping someone can help me out by replying here. 

My sister recently passed away, and my father is not taking it well. 

I've read Chiang's short story this is based on, and I know that the daughter's death is pretty foundational to the story. Is that the case in the film or do they restructure the story so it's more about humanity encountering the aliens and less about the linguist's personal story? I'm assuming it keeps the daughter plot and adds more around it. I really don't think he will be able to handle this movie if that's the case. 

For reference: we went to see ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" not knowing death was such a big part of the story and he wept through the last third; and not in a good, cathartic way, in an embarrassed, angry way. I'd like to try to avoid that if I can, the cineplex is not the ideal arena for my dad to work on issues and develop emotional openness.

It also was created by them which tells me they always thought this way.  It also may only have been created to communicate with us and save them.

I don't know... maybe something like a super advanced machine race that can even manipulate time itself like the Vex from Destiny attacks them etc, or any other innumerable scenarios you can think of.

This explanation would fit in a much more symbolic and poetic manner rather than a logical one, but it is a movie of artistic expression and I think that would have a kind of symmetrical beauty of its own: that while we're learning from them, they're learning from us as well. We're learning Calculus while they're learning Algebra, and both species have their perspectives changed or shifted (at least a bit) from this alien encounter.",5cc7fb

There's one minor question I've been thinking about.  Does Louise's ability to see time non-linearly extend to before she learned their language?  I was thinking about one of the opening scenes when Louise was heading to the lecture hall.  She didn't take much notice to everyone gathered around the TV.  Though she seemed surprised that no one was in the lecture hall, did she know, even subconsciously, what was happening?

Her daughter is the first person with that disease and because of her they find a cure to prevent or slow down the disease. I think the Aliens are from the future.

d9ww4uu,"The ending was my one issue with Arrival. They shoe-horned that love story into it, which I wouldn't mind, but the dialogue was so ham-fisted and overtly obvious. It all could've been implied:

1a. They shouldn't have shown Jeremy Renner in the future (personal choice; this is a story about her and her daughter, not him)

1b. After showing him, the girl yells ""Daddy!"" Again, didn't need to be said.

2a. The dialogue turned awful. ""Whenever I looked at the stars I was amazed but not as amazed as when I looked at you""

2b. ""Do you want to make a baby?"" Really!? C'mon! We get it!!!

d9yb2jn,"The ""Louise meets with General Shang"" scene is pivotal and I couldnt remember the exact wording after my first viewing, but since its so important - and will confuses the hell out of many people - I wrote it down during my second. This is how it went

---

*General Shang comments how Louise reached out and called him on his private number.*

**Louise:** ""I dont know your private number""

*General Shang leans over and shows Louise his phone with his private number displayed.*

**Shang:** ""Now you know.""

**Shang:** ""I do not claim to know how your mind works, but I believe it was important for you to see that.""

*Louise pauses for a moment and thinks.*

**Louise:** ""I called you, didnt I?""

**Shang:** ""Yes, you did"".

**Shang:** ""I will never forget what you said"".

*Louise looks at him confused/unaware what hes referring to. Shang leans in to whisper in her ear.*

**Shang:** ""You told me my wifes dying words"".

*Shang leans in and whispers his wifes dying words in Louises ear.*

---

So this is a paradox in the film. Louise, during the events of the film, is dialling a phone number and saying something that she doesnt actually know or find out until some time later in the future. And, later in the future during that ball scene: Shang, for unknown and unexplained reasons - even to him - feels that its important to show Louise his private number and tell her his wifes dying words, allowing her past self (during the film) to peer into the future and use what she eventually learns in the future to affect present day events during the film.

Enough to make your head explode!

The conclusion i've come to is that things only DONT make sense here if we think about time in the traditional way, which of course we naturally do, because we're human. What happens is chicken and egg paradox, and our heads explode.
 
When we think about time we anchor ourselves using concepts like 'past present future' to help understand things.
 
Louise doesnt experience time in the same way anymore after learning Heptapod. So the concepts of 'start middle end' or 'past present future' essentially lose their meanings as we understand them. Time is no longer a linear concept heading in one direction as we ordinarily treat it, but nonlinear and accessible at any point.
 
The above sentence means that Louise is able to use an event that occurs in what us humans call 'the future' to affect what us humans call 'the present day'. But to her - shes just accessing different parts of a nonlinear timeline and using one to affect the other.

db238of,"This movie was horrible. And not for the low-brow reason that it didn't have enough CGI and boom boom violence and speedy space ships and sex or any of that. 

It was horrible because the implications make it all pointless.

Consider that in life and in fiction, anticipation and not knowing is the thrill. We're along for a ride. A linear one where we go from ignorance to experience to memory.

Here, there is nothing at stake. The central drama of will the aliens help or hurt us, will we communicate, will we die... is irrelevant. Main characters don't need to save the world because it was never in peril.  The aliens would never retaliate. 

[They did not retaliate for the first bomb, and inexplicably allow one of them to be killed by it. So they would not retaliate to the Chinese attempts. The aliens know what is going to happen so they wouldn't need to play a tit-for-tat game.](#spoiler)

Omniscience ruins everything. It turns Louise in to a monster essentially.  She does what she does AFTER contact knowing full well that it will ruin another person or two's life, doing so. That makes her a monster.  And really, we as humans live our lives not knowing what's coming and that makes bad outcomes from good decisions bearable. But we see multiple times in this film that the power which should change everything, changes nothing.

And the central twist is all just pseudo-intellectual. A paradox, which SEEMS clever but it's just a paradox, there's no value there. And the other part is just manipulative storytelling. But after you get the story you realize the sad part that it doesn't matter.

Her personal life drama after the event means nothing. It's just a coda to a story.  It doesn't change anything. Not the central question, not what we see on screen. Which removes all of the impact of it.  

Too much pseudo in this movie. Not enough actual meat.  It basically just hides a paradox in an otherwise too slow and boring shell. ",5cc7fb

Linear time gives meaning to human life. How you live your 120 years in this whole TIME line. In movie as u all heard, ancient greece talked about hecktopodus and alien also said 3000 years later. 3000 years ago started first ancient greece civilization Mikenians, Minonians. Well after 3000 years came Christians, Jesus a linear time line. I am not sure if movie author wants to say that. Before that, lets take an example for cyclic time line(where aliens had no time), if we look back in history, Hindians had no time, they had cycle, which we translate ""a year died, a year be born again""-in movie u all heard ""Kebo is a death process"". When the first arabs visited Hindians, they asked them, what time is it, who was your king 100 years ago? Hindians couldn't answer, they couldn't even tell the, what is yestarday and what is one hour or anything with time. But they had strong cosmoss-stars observations, just like Babylonians. I don't think this movie is about language idea, it's about time idea, how you would live, if u woulda know future? past? OR there is no time?

Inception: It would seem as if both Louis and Shang were both harnessing a self-awareness in that scene, in which they both ""traveled/experience"" the future.

2) Just before a character announces that the Russians quit all communication, a camera pan shows some of the Americans communicating with their foreign on their computers. One of them is speaking with the Russians. Is this an error, or did I miss something?

So Louise is trying to decipher their language, and at a bout 45 minutes into the film, Ian's voiceover just basically sums it up by explaining...what exactly?
We get some nonsense about how their ""written"" language isn't the same as their spoken language, and then we get flashes of ""words"" with english ""earth,"" ""man,"" ""time"" etc...

My question is, how in the heck is this possible? Imagine if you met a being that not only spoke and wrote a different language, but had a completely different concept of what language is and the correlation between written and spoken. It also effects their perception of time. The sounds are completely different. The symbols are not representative of words, yet representative of ""meanings.""
We see no indication that they have an understanding of English. When she points to herself and says ""Louise,"" how do they even understand that's her name? Do Heptapods have names?

Maybe they had to come right now, at this point in time, to plant this process of non-linear time in human heads to make sure that in 3000 years, we would have evolved capabilities they need, like stopping time, or transferring our conscious into another body or communicating via thoughts.

[ + They gather a linguist and a physicist but not a biologist or an astronomer or even a sound technician ? 
+ Alien obviously looks like some kind of octopus and even writes with ink and lives in a liquid like environment but no one ever mentions this.
+ Aliens can see in the far future but still somehow need Earth's help in 3000 years... if they see the future and have 3000 years to prepare regardless of their perception of time why do they need earth again ?
+ If they see the future how could they not see the Bomb ?
+ If they see the future why not come prepared and make it easier for humans to understand their purpose like '' I'm here to teach you our language so you can perceive time like we do, please don't shoot ''
+ Military just lets everyone in and out of the craft as they please, no one notices tons of C4 missing, military people can watch TV and access the internet despite operating at top-secret level. Alien Craft isn't guarded 24/7
+ All this High-Tech equipment and they use a canary to measure the toxicity of the air, seriously what was the purpose of that ? Not to mention why would you show a canary constantly chirping to aliens ? They would be like WTF are these apes doing?
+ Main Character can see in the future, and because of that makes the decision to have her daughter nonethless, but if she knows the future, the fact that she knows makes it impossible to reproduce everything perfectly to have her daughter, just an extra glass of wine or any minimal change in diet or behaviour during the 9 month pregnancy or the second \ hour sperm is released and the outcome could be very differently. 
+ The first thought of the government is '' they are out to get us'' despite being clearly light years ahead technologically, allowing them to enter the craft, not attacking them etc... 
+ Aliens are not that bright either, if they can see future and past why land on Sierra Leone, Venezuela and Sudan if it requires all 12 ships '' pieces of the puzzle '' to be worked together with other nations. Those nations aren't exactly the brightest, safest or most advance and why land in Siberia of all places.
+ And they didn't even need all 12 ships, the Main character just entered the craft and costello showed\ explained everything. Why not do that first ?] (#spoiler)

d9y85p2,"I went to see this movie without having watched the trailer, only having seen the poster and hearing someone say it was better than Interstellar. I'm an aerospace engineer, scifi stuff partly inspired my desire to work in the field, and Interstellar truly captured the ""why"" behind what I do and how I feel about space travel and exploration.

Unfortunately, I felt Arrival didn't even come close - I left the theater feeling it was at best 6.5/10.

The visuals were stunning, the aliens were uniquely presented and well-crafted, and their language was brilliantly constructed. I felt that it could truly be an alien language. A friend whispered that Steven Wolfram helped design the interface they used to interact with the language (and I chuckled when there was some Mathematica on the screen), which was neat.

However, I felt the dialogue was rather cliche-ridden from the moment the Colonel stepped in the room. In fact, most of the characters except for Banks seemed to speak only in tropes -

Colonel Weber was a classic and obvious audience surrogate, saying basically everything except ""In English, please."" That'd be fine, but I think they could have been more subtle, or at least touched on the security aspect of their work a bit more. The brief bit where he discusses that the words they choose to share with an extraterrestrial, incredibly advanced, thus far reticent species must be carefully chosen was solid. That line of thinking probably wouldn't occur to some academic linguist.

One of Donnelly's first lines was to claimed that science, not language was the basis of civilization. I know that's meant to establish him as skeptic of Banks's approach, but it was just so typically ""look at me, I'm a scientist who doesn't understand art and culture and finds them useless."" His character seems sort of just *there* to move the plot along and say lines that prompt Banks's actions - the exception being when he figures out the 1/12 trick, which is cool.

I actually liked Captain Marks. I think his reaction to the events was very very human. I sort of wish we could have explored his reactions more, but they it was presented was done expertly - just the briefest snapshots showing his thought process.

Overall, I don't think I'd watch the movie again. I didn't find the plot very confusing. It certainly didn't inspire me the way Interstellar did. To me it was a good popcorn flick; certainly a relatively novel concept with good imagery, but the dialogue and characters made it a one-watch sort of thing.

* I enjoyed this, but Contact is still the all-time Heavyweight champion of ""smart"" alien sci-fi to me.

* The opening scene is intentionally misleading almost to the point of cheating.

* Most of the film is not that eventful or entertaining.

* The ending earns my respect for the philosophical questions it brings up. Is it truly worth the journey if you know the ending will be so horrifying? I absolutely loved how the little girl said ""daddy doesn't look at me the same way"" and Louise says ""I told him something about a rare disease in the future. And he told me I made the wrong choice."" That's a realistic, dark ending. You imagine Ian saying ""what the fuck?!?! You knew we would have a beautiful, wonderful little girl who would turn into the greatest tragedy of both our lives, and CHOSE to do it?!?!""

From a meta-narrative perspective I feel somewhat cheated. Placing that individualistic story in the context of something grand and awe-inspiring like heptapods is just... ugh. What a wasted opportunity.

I felt like the ending dragged big time by about 10-15 minutes. Ok, we get it, she chooses the path that she knows ends in tragedy. Do we really need to spend the entire rest of the movie with the sappy music over flash-forward scenes? It just went ON and ON.",5cc7fb

I mean, technically her actions possibly were what caused the riff between her and Ian, her not telling him she knew Hannah was going to die since the start might have been the reason of their fallout, but it was the only life she had seen, therefore the only one possibly, because according to the aliens, time was non-linear, possibly a looped and tied in.

(1) What it was about: Seeing life outside the march of time. Letting go of our limited view of the present moment and acknowledging its place in a greater whole.

(2) How it was about it: Anticipation! The unknown nature of the aliens, of other humans. There's even the classic Hitchcockian bomb-under-the-table (not literally) scene of suspense.

I'm not sure what to make of this, but I find it interesting that a movie about letting go of the present moment and seeing the future spent most of its time focused on the present moment and of NOT knowing the future.

It seems possibly deliberate, as a way of emphasizing to us our way of thinking, to better illustrate the alternative.

And yet, there's a part of me that feels like we'd be missing something if we really could see the future. The lack of information can bring its own joys.

Ultimately, the movie ends with the heptapods giving the gift of their language, which allows for some sort of precognition (with the science being waved away as 'learning a language alters the brain').  But even that precognizant world isn't really explained.  Reminds me of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-nPQQWIf3c&t=120",5cc7fb
d9x2wrd,"I think there is a problem with the story.

If heptapods were able to see time non-linearly (as implicated in the movie experiencing every slice of time simultaneously, hence not experiencing time at all), they would know everything that is going to happen since it has already happened. That indicates the universe is pre-determined. 

After all, it seems Louise had no choice to alter the future. But nevertheless, she could have gone differently. It was always possible not having that child. What would happen if she continued that way?

Having foresights about future is irrational. Let's assume if you know what will happen at point B, when you are actually in point A. (A is former than B) The moment you didn't like what is happening at point B, you would change your actions (like having a child or not, it wasn't inevitable to have a children with Ian.), hence would go somewhere not-B. So, your foresight about point B would become false. In order to make sense, one has to see either all possibilities or not even a single one. We currently live in a universe that makes sense by not knowing the future.

To sum up, it was a poetic and baffling idea, well supported by music. It was a delight to watch. But logically, it wasn't plausible.

 - Definitely one of, if not, the best films about Alien contact.

 - The Twist about the daughter blew my mind. Didn't see it until it smacked me right in the face.

- I *loved* the cinematography and visuals of the film. My stomach lurched when they went through the Gravity shift.


*QUESTIONS*

- The pace picked up quickly and the ""Use Weapon"" message got past me. What did the hetpapods mean by that?

- Did Abbot know he was going to die?

- Was unifying Earth the hetpapod's purpose? Cause they needed a united human race in 3000 years?

da0x4yw,"Just a comment on the foggy glass window motif and its possible symbolic connotation with perception. Others have noted how the initial clumsy and limited communication with the aliens through that small foggy window resembled a lot of repeated shots of Amy Adams' character looking out through a similar-looking window in her home. 

To me, symbolically, this greatly resembles that famous Corinthians quote from the Bible: *""For now we see through a glass darkly, then we shall see face to face.""* I think that initial frustrating and cumbersome process of communication through that tiny foggy window was also a great metaphor of our limited perception of time and reality, as if we are viewing the truth of reality through a straw. Eventually, Amy's character makes the first burgeoning steps towards expanding her perception, first by getting closer and touching the window, and then even getting to the other side and being immersed in it completely--having been ""awakened"" in a sense. 

The movie, Ghost in the Shell, used that Corinthians quote to represent similar themes, especially in a character's initial limited perception and her growing steps to eventually expand both her perception and existence.",5cc7fb
da17i4l,"I saw the movie yesterday and I'm still in awe.

Best movie I've seen in a long time - in years.

Science Fiction for me always has been more than just ""A movie set in (the future/a distant place in the galaxy/a different timeline/outer space)"".
For me this setting is always just a means to gain a different perspective to discuss important topics like social change, possible threats coming upon us through technological breakthrough, the human nature or philosophical concepts.
And Arrival excells at that.

All the philosophical implications this movie brings up so cleverly and so effortlessly. Besides the criticism of human societies choosing violence as a means to resolve problems far too easily it also brings up the question: If you knew your child will be sick while you are still pregnant, will you still deliver it?

This is a question many parents ask themselves now, with the limited resources at hand, but this question will be more important in the near future when gene analysis will be cheap and will be able to predict chances of a big variety of diseases throughout life.

da1achc,"Overall, I thought it was a pretty good movie. The plot was good and the acting was outstanding, especially by Amy Adams. It was emotionally poignant throughout.

However, two things really bugged me:

1. How in the world can you delve into linguistic theories of mind but you can't get simple uniform stuff right? Maybe I'm alone here but I find that incredibly frustrating. It instantly pulls me out of the movie. I see them screw up basic things like saluting or badge placement on uniforms and it immediately reminds me that I'm watching actors, not a story. It's very distracting and would be super easy to fix. I get that it's hollywood, but it isn't hard to be accurate. Clearly they at least *somewhat* looked up where everything goes on your uniform. Why couldn't they just go the extra mile and do things right?

2. The ""angry conservative"" subplot felt shoehorned in and was a bit offensive. Like do we really think that conservatives would be chomping at the bit to kill some alien visitors? I doubt it, at least not on a large scale. Aggression against alien visitors would be much more nuanced, like the actions of the Chinese in this film.

da21c07,"I think the physical appearance of the Heptapods' spaceships indicates that the Hetapods themselves actually *dwell* in the 4th dimension (space-time) and are simply dipping their toes into the third dimension during the film.

Here's an exercise, which I borrowed and rehashed from [The Three Body Problem](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem) (which is a fantastic book, by the way): try to imagine that two-dimensional beings exist in their two-dimensional world, and that we, as three-dimensional beings, enter their world. How would we appear to the 2D beings? Clearly they wouldn't be able to process the *depth* that our figures hold, and perhaps we would simply appear to those beings as flattened, 2D renderings of ourselves.

Similarly, in Arrival, the Heptapods' spaceships seem [bizarrely minimalist](http://filmpulse.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/arrival.jpg), almost as if the ships themselves aren't actually *ships*, but are rather mere fingertips (I think the filmmakers rendered them like this intentionally) of an interconnected, four-dimensional 'hand' that us three-dimensional beings cannot perceive. 

I think this theory is supported by a couple more points:

* we never see the sequence in which the heptapods actually arrive on Earth

* when they depart, they seemingly evaporate into thin air, rather than take off like a conventional spaceship 

* More speculative: when Louise enters into the 'mini-pod' towards the end of the film, the pod itself never docks into the primary ship, suggesting that those two vessels are connected by a seemingly invisible channel (and also notice in this sequence, by the way, that Louise can suddenly breathe without problem while in the heptapods' chamber. Different atmosphere? More like different dimension to which Louise has adequately adapted at this point in the story line)

da2rntx,"Alright I just saw this movie and I pretty much hated it. Not so much for the acting or the fact that I expect movies to be 100 percent realistic, but in the same realm of Interstellar there is just a huge gaping plot hole with this movie. I believe this just like Interstellar gets to a point where the directors paint themselves into a corner of believably only to use the uncanny to tie up the story line.

For instance here is my problems with the movie. Maybe someone can explain or help me understand. 

1. We are to assume the aliens lived for 3000 years or more considering that they have the foresight to see beyond the normal life expectancy of humans however what was the point of visiting earth now? Also what does the ""gift"" of foresight unlock if the average human life expectancy to most likely learn/understand and use the gift completely only has a shelf life of something like 60-80 years per human. 

2. What does the concept of non-linear time even mean? If I could see most of my life choices in the future what does the concept of choosing a different path even entail? For example if I know I am going to be a Burger King worker 30 years from now and I can see that can I also see the path of being the President considering I reject the notion of working at Burger King? I do not understand how Louise could see her life path laid out, but she was powerless to see alternatives. If this is just a looking glass and we are all predestined then what is the point of the ""gift"" anyways?

3. What is the point of the aliens visiting the other sites anyways if they have the foresight to know that Louise will figure out the key to cracking the code. Apparently they can see the things such as the explosion in the ship, but they can not see the progress they were making with human interactions? Even if they did not understand our language wouldn't they have seen the interactions with Louise in advance just like Louise did with her daughter? I mean the aliens left after Louise cracked the code further proving this point.

3. Finally and this is the one that fucking drives me insane. If Louise can see her daughters death and told Ian after she was born why couldn't Ian foresee this as well? After all it was him who cracked the code on parallel space between the symbols. Why didn't Ian come to accept the ""gift"" just shortly after. Are we to assume Louise kept it from all of society until after her daughter died? I am not sure how that could have happened since pretty much everyone was close to having the same revelation Louise did or is she just some super hero? If she knew she was going to be with Ian and procreate why can her mind not figure out a path in which she tells Ian pre-conception ""hey this is what is going to happen"". 

Furthermore if cracking the code entails foresight wouldn't pretty much every nation in the world withhold or use this knowledge like the Russians did to divide us? If China could see themselves becoming the greatest nation in the world what premise would there be to work together unless it is in the year 2900-3000 where they can see the alien threat? ",5cc7fb

Once you've seen the end of the film, you realize that in fact she only knew the phrase *because* Ian had said it during first contact.

So let's leap forward to the victory party where the Chinese general called off the attack on the ""time space craft."" He stated that Louise did something that no one, not even his superiors were able to do, and that was to""change his mind"".

Louise was able to change his mind because in the""present-ish"" time frame that she was in, she called the general on his personal phone, and reiterate his wife's dying words. 

BUT...

These words were only shared with Louise at the victory celebration. In order to meet Louise at the victory celebration, Victory had to occur in the first place, and victory could have not occurred if she didn't know the generals phone number or wife's dying last words.

One theme that sort of occurred to me is one of humanity maturing as a species. The Kardashev scale came to mind... perhaps a possible scenario of humanity graduating from level 1 to level 2. I recall hearing Michio Kaku talk about it. But when I went back and read the wiki on the Kardashev scale it deals exclusively in harnessing energy, where Arrival deals in the harnessing of time.... which kind of makes the Kardashev scale obsolete.

dadhjm4,"I found the voiceover of Jeremy Renner yada-yadaing away all of the process of actually communicating with the aliens very annoying. Suddenly we have names for the aliens and can basically talk to them. I think they did away with what should have been most fun parts of the story. Consequently, the relationship between Amy Adam's character and Jeremy Renner's character isn't strong enough for me to feel emotionally attached to at the end when the violins start swelling. They are both scientists of sorts, lets see some chemistry. 

Additionally, I found the soldier's rebellion to be pretty silly. Contact (1997) had the same problem of relying on extremists to further the plot when there are plenty of smart reasons why some feel contact should be avoided. I'm eagerly awaiting mainstream scifi movies that are rationalist, no simplistic villains necessary. It's still a step up from Contact's religious zealots somehow blowing up a space shuttle but it could be much better.

And the last bit of dialogue where Renner's character proclaims that meeting her was more amazing than meeting the aliens? Yuck. If they wanted to make that line work, they should have juxtaposed it with future Renner saying he wishes he never met her once he finds out his daughter will die at a young age and there is nothing he can do about it; paralleling it to how her daughter tells her she loves and then hates her at the beginning of the movie. That would reinforce the idea that our experiences are deterministic, and would make Adam's character's decision to embrace the future more poignant because it is bittersweet.

dagn3qa,"After watching the movie. I realized how amazing that opening scene was. It gives you the answer to everything when she is saying ""come back to me"" to the newborn Hannah when she is really saying that to the Hannah who had just passed.

Once you figure the movie out. The whole movie becomes non linear just as time is non linear when she learns the language. 

I really love these types of movies and hope to see more like this in the future. Makes you think not only throughout the entire move but for days after as well.

dahxxmd,"Arrival and Collective Consciousness

When the hectapods said that 'many become one', it made me think about collective consciousness.

What they have essentially done here, is to set in motion an evolutionary path for humanity. The first step of this is the coming together of nations. 

When Lousie and Chang interact with each other across time, they essentially break the chain of causality, so in a sense their minds get linked in a causal loop. 

It makes sense to imagine that as more people gain this ability, inter human communication will become increasingly more complex, until we are essentially working with 'one mind'

When the heptapods say ""Louise is weapon"" do they mean that she, singularly, is imbued with the power of cyclical time comprehension? She mentions that the power is in the language, and once you know it you would have the power, right when they are evacuating towards the end of the movie. (Which also is an awesome foreshadow earlier in the movie when Ian says a line from her book in the helicopter ""Language is the first weapon to be drawn in a conflict"") 

I have a better time believing that the power resides in the language, and she wasn't singularly picked to be some messiah, considering you see the time line of her in her auditorium at University teaching the Alien language to students. If she didn't teach it, how would the knowledge of the language possibly survive 3000 years until the Heptapods needed them? I just can't understand why they broke up then.

db34eun,"I genuinely thought this movie was stupid and not entertaining.  I'd appreciate someone explaining why they think this movie was a masterpiece.  My criticisms are below.

First, the aliens looked ridiculous.  A good alien should show us a ""novel"" design but also a ""functional"" design.  The novel design has to be such that the alien can DO what the movie suggests the alien can do.  Here, the design of the alien was cool in the sense that it equipped them to speak the language (squid + ink), but it makes no sense a giant fucking squid could make a machine like the one we see.  This isn't about the director ""challenging"" my ideas of intelligence, its about a fucking giant squid literally not having the dexterity to create the ships we saw.  Now you could say ""maybe other aliens"" created the ships but that's just lazy in my opinion.

Second, so time isn't linear.  And?  Why the fuck has this plot device become popular recently and why is it so amazing.  Yes, the beginning of the movie is actually the future.  And?  So the fuck what?

Third, the aliens know the future, but they still need to reach out to humans for help?  If you know the future, fix it yourself, you wouldn't need to empower humans to do shit.

Fourth, dull dull dull characters.  Scientists don't have to be boring as fuck (holla to Matt Damon and the Martian).  But in watching this movie, did you care for a second about any of these characters?

Fifth, the daughter - why?  Why do we care?  How does this move the plot forward.  Fuck that, what was the plot?

d9wiix3,"I loved this movie up until they revealed that the aliens gift was their language which allowed the main character to view time non linearly and to ""remember"" the future. It felt cheap and lazy when the rest of the movie tries to stay grounded in reality and science then suddenly ""You know our alphabet so now you have super powers and can solve the worlds problems"". It completely broke my suspension of disbelief.

Earlier in the film they mentioned the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis which was a very simple anthropological idea that stated that the language you speak from birth affects your outlook on life and your understanding of how the world works, but that doesn't mean that you can change the laws of physics by knowing a different language. I feel like the writers just browsed Wikipedia and saw the portion about the Hopis and how their language has changed their perception of time in comparison to how the majority of other peoples view it. The issue with that is that Whorf lied and never interacted with the Hopis and their perception of time is nearly identical to everyone else which is why the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis has been heavily criticized for it's validity in the past decades.

Then the scene with the Chinese leader where he, not knowing that Amy Adams character could interact with time non-linearly, went out of his way to spell out how she solved everything with him which made no sense and felt super cheap and forced.

The rest of the movie was great, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and was blown away by the art direction and cinematography but after that ending it just lost me.

d9xn8oq,"I just got out of a showing and I was actually pretty disappointed and I'm very surprised to see everyone anointing this film as a ""best  movie of the year"". I thought there were too many plot holes that made it too unrealistic.

1. I could not get over how those low-level soldiers were able to steal supplies to make a bomb, transport it from the base to the pod and then plant it inside the pod without anyone noticing. We saw how tight security was and they had cameras and lights mounted at all angles around the pod. We already knew that the session as over so anyone going down to the pod and loading stuff into it would presumably be unauthorized, no?

2. We saw both Louise and Ian being stripped of their cell phones when they entered the base. Nobody else had any forms of communication with the outside world which they made a point to show in the scene with the soldiers talking to their families on the payphone type setup. And they were being very tight lipped about their situation, presuming that their communication would of course be monitored so they would not leak any important information to the outside world. So how come they had their macbooks while killing time in the barracks?! They were tuning into a conspiracy theory radio show no problem. They just as easily could have been sending out classified information via email or skype. 

3. This was the only pod to land in the United States. Wouldn't you think that they would have marines or special forces at this small site instead of young army soldiers? Outside of the colonel and the CIA guy, there seemed to be a serious lack of command and ranking power.

4. The casting, outside of Amy Adams, was akin to a Transformers level movie. The CIA guy was incredibly unconvincing and all of the soldiers looked fresh out of boot camp! Jeremy Renner was fine but he had nothing to work with. I felt that he was a plot device more than anything. It seemed like his main purpose for being there was to hold up a whiteboard or provide a simple mouth-wide-open reaction whenever Amy Adams character did anything impressive. I also found it funny that they did not show any interaction with the President of The United States ever. 

5. There were so many clues early on that the flashbacks were actually flash forwards that by the time the reveal came around, I was expecting it. They focused so heavily on the wedding ring in the opening scenes and then it was gone in the current scenes. Once they showed her daughter with the original drawing and you could see the birdcage below the mother and father it was so obvious that this was the future. I forget her line but it was something about ""mommy and daddy talking to animals"" which was pretty much exactly what they were doing in the scene right before. And when they finally started referring to the dad as a scientist, it was all over.

6. The overall cheesiness level was off the charts for such a serious movie. The dialogue at the end was so cringeworthy after such a serious movie that had no problems with writing up until this point. Renner's line about ""looking up at the stars all this time but the best thing about being there was working with you"" or whatever it was completely took me out of it. They had barely any personal interactions the whole movie and then he just tosses that out there? Im fine with a romance but it seemed so forced by that point. And of course the ""wanna make a baby"" line. I know it was word for word from the short story but I did not think it fit the seriousness of the film whatsoever. Finally, the cgi of Amy Adam's entry into the spaceship seemed like they ran out of money and had to throw some tv level special effects on her hair as a last ditch effort.

I love Villeneuve's work and directing style. Prisoners, Sicario, and Enemy are all fantastic films in my opinion. Arrival fell pretty far short of my expectations and a lot of people in my theaters expectations as well. Despite the rant, I did not find all of it bad though. The score, the cinematography, and Amy Adams were all solid, if not great. Multiple people fell asleep and I heard a lot of underwhelmed responses when the credits rolled. It was a 6/10 for me.

d9wf7rb,"THEORY TIME:

Okay, so I just saw the film, and I would like to point out something really cool I haven't seen mentioned anywhere yet. 

In 2001 a space odyssey, Kubrick goes against the description of the monolith in the book to better fit his narrative as a film maker. Basically if you haven't seen or read the analysis of that film, it's that the monolith is the representation of the theater screen, it being the same aspect ratio and all. 

I think that's EXACTLY what this film is doing with the space crafts 'window'. The most glaring support for this is the end credits: the whole screen is depicted as the window as the credits roll. At that point, the film is basically screaming at you to make this connection. 

The movie is try to communicate through us in the same way the aliens are trying to communicate to humanity in the film. We spend the whole film questioning what's going on, only to realize it in a single moment of brilliance, the same way Amy Adams does. It actually helps translate the more cerebral moments in the film to be easier understood. 

You can even look at the inside of the spacecraft as a literal representation of the movie theater: the entrance to the theater as being either, A.) the entrance to the movie theatre, or B.) the projector projecting onto the screen. We the audience play the role as the scientists and linguists entering the spacecraft to learn. The screen is our window to the meaning of the message. 

Then again, I could be completely crazy and over analyzing everything. ",5cc7fb

d9xlujo,"**LONG AS SHIT**

I see a lot of people angry with Amy Adams because people think she 'chose' to have a kid.

With my understanding of non-linear time, choice does not/can't exist. Everything that has happened, or will happen, is all happening at the same time, therefore how could their be choice? 

To clarify this more let me give you some background information. In 1905 (I think) Einstein discovered that time itself is slower for the person that is moving. So for example, if I am sitting at a bus stop, time is moving faster for me than the people driving past me in their car. Now, since these speeds are so small in comparison with the universe, we don't notice this 'time' difference. But we can measure it. Einstein flew an atomic clock around the earth in a plane and compared it with an atomic clock on the ground. The difference in time between the two clocks was super super super small, but there was a difference. This theory has been repeated/tested many times throughout history and it still holds today. Proving that movement effects time.

So now to apply this to non-linear time. Imagine that 200 thousand light years away there is an Alien sitting at his local bus stop. I too, am also sitting at a bus stop on earth. While we are sitting still, time will be the same for both of us. Whats happening NOW on earth will be the same for both parties (If the Alien had a live stream of Earth, the Alien would see what I see. But now lets include movement. Let's say the Alien gets up and starts biking in the direction away from earth. He is now moving and I am still sitting still. Time is now moving slower for him than it is for me. Now if we were both on earth, this time difference is not noticeable at all. But since this Alien is 200 thousand light years away, this change in time is going to be pretty significant. So in theory, as he moves away from earth, what would be happening right 'now' for him on 'earth' would be in the past for us. And in reverse, as he is moving on his bike closer to earth, what's happening now on earth would be in the future. To visualize this, I drew an MS paint picture :D. 

[Picture](http://imgur.com/a/aMIkt) everything like a graph. on the x-axis you have time, on the y-axis you have all of space. The straight line represents whats happening right 'NOW' as both me and the alien are sitting at the bus stop. Right now, time is the same for both of us (hence the straight line). If he had a livefeed of earth while sitting still, he would see the same stuff I do. The diagonal line represents the difference in time as the alien moves away from earth. Notice how at first the gap between the straight line and diagonal isn't big. This is because the difference in time at first will be really really small, but then the gap in time increases and increases and increases as you get closer to earth. So now, if this Alien were to have a live feed of earth, if would be of in the past (for us). He could be seeing whats going on in the 1960's for example. Like mentioned before, it works the other way too, if hes moving towards earth, that diagonal line would be revered and he would see earth in the future. 

What this proves is that when you add motion to the equation, time becomes different for everybody. There is no one set 'TIME'. Just as we think of all of space as being all out there. We should think of time the same way. The past, present, and future are all existing at the same time, what is happening 'NOW' for me, will be different than someone from another planet. So if this is true, than that means the future is already decided, and therefore we don't/Amy Adams, doesn't have choice. She can't effect the 'future' because the future is happening at the same time as the present. 

Now this is my understanding of non-linear time. If someone has an easier way to put it, or if i'm completely wrong, please correct me. I also may have just confused you guys more. I'm Sorry. xD

I found myself bored during her moments of emotion. I felt as though pitting us against the Chinese and Russians was a cheap way of creating tension, and the bomb plot was dumb because I assume the aliens knew about it in advance so why even let the men in at all?

When Louis says to Ian in the end ""I forgot how good it felt to be held by you"", is she saying that foreseeing the future(which is a bit out of place and weird considering she is yet to fall in love with Ian) or she is reliving the past (where the aliens visited them, then she had Hannah and somehow past is repeating, umm.. I am still struggling with this concept though)? Why would she say that?? 

Also, was there a significance of the bird in the cage? Hannah drew it in her drawing, so I feel it must serve a bigger purpose than just acting like a tester in the Alien shell. 

And how was Louis able to write the message ""offer weapon"" with just one hand? May be I missed something

And lastly, is the only reason behind Hannah's name is that the aliens write with both hands for the pattern to converge identically into the intended sentence. ",5cc7fb
d9xv3ju,"I had high hopes for this movie based on the reviews, but ultimately was left confused/disappointed.

I enjoyed the movie for what it was up until the end.  I thought it was well made.  The build up to seeing the aliens, their technology, their complex language, what they looked like, the impact them visiting had on the modern world, and using the basic origins of language/math to try and communicate with them was great fun to watch.  

But then about the time the bomb went off, the whole movie just fell apart for me.  It went from ""oh, I wonder what they are going to learn from the aliens and how everything will come together"" to some kind of bizarre deep rabbit hole plot twist with a corny love story tacked on the end.  It was disappointing.  

It took me a while to realize that the daughter at the beginning of the movie and in so many flash backs hadn't been born yet, and I was scratching my head wondering how she was going to fall in love with the same guy and have the same kid again like it hadn't happened before.  Once I did realize they were ""front flashes"" and not ""back flashes"" of events, it made a bit more sense, but the movie itself just felt like some kind of long con in order to bring somebody's neat idea of cyclical time concept theory the big screen.  It just felt like a cheap cop out of an otherwise solid and interesting movie.

The movie went from ""wow, this is interesting, I will need to watch this movie two or three times to find all the deeper meaning in it"" to ""oh, it was all a build up to this one punch line at the end, now that I know the ending I don't want to watch this again.""  If they would have changed the last 20 minutes to something more mysterious or open ended I would love this movie for what it was.  It shouldn't take a huge alien invasion and the fate of the world at stake to remind one person to enjoy life as it happens.",5cc7fb

dcpph16,"I can get over the clairvoyant oracle thing and how love overcomes all. Oops thats the wrong movie. I mean alien language makes you see into future. What bothered me more than anything was the writer's interpretation of humanity. 

I was really expecting a more Star Trek mentality. After all, our protagonist is a god damned linguist for christ's sake. Could you think of a more bland sounding, semi-obscure field than that? They didn't send in some science man. They sent in a pretty specific scientist with a specific purpose. I assumed the government portrayed would be somewhat competent. What happened was a pathetic take on humanity, depicting us as people so afraid of the unknown, that we're willing to blow up the unknown. Do you see the contradiction there. We're too scared of what we don't know, so we're going to attack it because we're scared. 


But that's my fundamental issue with the movie. The writer apparently thinks the world works on the whims and emotions of a single man and everyone blindly follows orders and leads humanity into extinction. 

The movie itself was directed brilliantly. It is just the writing i have a problem with.

**Now, I'm going to nitpick the writing.**

Anyways, we first see our protagonist, she's doing normal things until the military comes to take her away. I was thinking, maybe they should run some checks you know. Maybe get a psychologist to verify she's not some sort of pussy. Maybe not fly her directly into the fucking alien shell ship. Maybe brief her a bit on what they already know so she doesn't go in there blind, piss her pants and then make a fool out of humanity. I mean, this is technically our representative for humanity right? So what happens when our protagonist enters the ship is her pissing herself in fear while the rest of the team check their wristwatch and wait for this woman to get a grip of herself. Yeah yeah, its supposed to set the tone for us audience blah blah. The anti contamination suits were good though. 



Simultaneously, I was thinking, this probably isn't a national issue or a national decision right? Its fucking aliens. I mean, presumably people would get together and set politics aside or at least put it in a lesser priority box for the sake of HUMANITY. I mean we don't have to look far to see that humanity can cooperate right? Yes we have separate space programs but the ISS has ALWAYS had a damned Russian and an American in it. There's absolutely politics surrounding the ISS but so much that we can't even work together? No. They have like one throw away news beat that says ""they talked in the UN"". You know what should've happened? Everyone gets together at the UN. They decide this is too big to fuck around with politics. They decide, one contact with a single ship at a time. Someone gets pissed because only the yankees are going. They agree to attach some lackey Ruski and Chinaman to the expedition. They're told to do shit in there so their country gets some credit as well. Then the aliens show up and they shut their shit and stop playing games. 

Anyways, Miss Amy Adams goes in the hole again and she's so smart she brings a whiteboard with her. At this point I'm wondering where all the other linguists are. You know what probably should happen? Leave stupid ass Jeremy Renner behind, and bring five other linguists. Why do they need *The Chosen One*. What is this, some stupid young adult teen novel? Evidently, Yes. Yes it is. You know what they should've done? They should've had a group of linguists go in there with some military dudes so the country's leading nerds in linguistics don't all die. And before they ask questions, they should probably consult amongst themselves. In fact, why do we even need linguists to go in there. Linguists aren't diplomats. Why not just have the linguists at camp and have a bunch of people who don't shit themselves go in there instead, come out with information, and give it the linguists. Or if you MUST have Amy Adams go in there, have a dedicated group of linguists and code breakers analysing the data back at base and have Amy Adams take a break. Maybe have another group of linguists or body language experts coach Amy Adams on what not to do when she goes back in. Like maybe shitting herself and making humans look like cowards. Experts could've told Amy Adams not to do that. Instead, we have genius Amy Adams going in there like Rambo by herself and cleaning house with her brilliance. Seriously. Is there a fundamental difference between Amy Adams the super scientist who is smarter than the world or super soldier Rambo who can kill 30 charlies by himself. The general of China comes and personally thanks her and gives her a medal for saving the world. Christ. 

And another thing. Before they even go in there. They have like what? 24 hours did they say? There should be a briefing before EVERY entering of the hole. This isn't hindsight by the way, this is common fucking sense. Government suits should be there advising what they can and cannot say. The structure and outline of the session. What they need to know.  This is really basic shit isn't it? They have briefings and meetings at a company that makes envelopes for fucks sake. Like this is probably how it would actually work right? Amy Adams the linguist goes in. She comes out. She gets briefings for 10 hours on what to do, what not to do. Instead, we have Amy Adams befriend the aliens, decrypt the secret code, and save the world all by herself. I wanted a sci fi movie about humanity damn it. Not a movie about Amy Adams the chosen human who exceeds what all of humanity could ever hope to achieve. 

Continuing, Amy Adams defiantly takes off her suit and walks towards the Aliens. In a brave move, she is able to communicate with the aliens more effectively, and for the first time, they make progress as the Aliens try to communicate visually. Throughout all this, Amy Adams is grinning knowingly. She knows she has done it. She gives a nod to Jeremy Renner and smiles at him. Okay problem. You know how they say don't show your teeth at gorillas or whatever because its a sign of aggression. Yeah, surely the most brilliant linguist of the world knows this right? I mean she isn't even smiling. She just starts walking towards the aliens with her mouth open and her teeth showing. Her body language was really confident (showing how badass Amy Adams is). Jeeze. Maybe an alien with an alien understanding of humanity and its ways of communications MIGHT construe this as an aggressive stance. I mean after all, it was partly a show of defiance to the intellectual deficients attached with her expedition. Apart from the teeth thing, [a smile can be deceptive and can indicate one of a 117 things](https://youtu.be/nq3Wlk2w-Zw?t=641). Even when people AREN'T dealing with aliens, in some professions they're supposed to show no emotions. And this is just humans we're talking about.

dfzkqk7,Wait why does everyone think this movie was so good? It wasn't obvious that her daughter happens in the future for most of the movie?

If the answer is that they united humanity that is pretty cheesy,5cc7fb
d9xm501,"Honestly, I really had a lot of problems with this movie.

1) The gimmick at the beginning where we as viewers expect the events to unfold to be sequential. I thought her child dying was what set forth the color-correction for the first part of the film. Very dull and desaturated compared to the more vibrant scenes with her daughter. I thought this spurred forward the alien arrivals, and she would be similar to Anne Hathaway/Sandra Bullock's character in Interstellar/Gravity (I forgot which one lost their daughter).

2) The flashbacks that happened in the movie prior to Amy Adams meeting the aliens. Maybe I'm remembering it wrong, but I think it would make a lot more sense if she stated seeing her future daughter AFTER making alien contact, and make MUCH MORE sense when she is able to comprehend more of the alien language.

3) the CGI scene where she goes into the ship was fucking awkward as hell.

4) Renner being a physicist but able to know enough about language to decipher a code while Amy Adams is asleep. Maybe he's just a super intelligent guy who can pick up things fast. 

5) I felt like both Renner and the aliens were plot devices. The aliens didn't really do much besides provide a language. I guess I came in with the wrong expectations that they'd be some Lovecraft-esque monster given their tentacle design. All they really provided was a language, and I felt that to be anticlimactic.

6) IDK overall thought it was really slow. Almost doze off twice.

d9vnbty,"The film reminded me a lot of Source Code (another well-reviewed film I didn't really like). Both films involve a final act altering time with no real explanation or setup for how that would even be possible within the constraints of the movie world. If the aliens brought some ""mystery goo""  that alters time- then okay, I'll buy it. It doesn't have to be crazy inventive- ""it"" just has to exist. Amy Adam's character learns a new, non-linear language, and now she exists in a non-linear, non-timebound state? There are several other things you can nitpick, like ""If Amy Adams knows her child will die from a rare disease, wouldn't she invest money into trying to cure/ prevent it? Clearly she's making millions and millions from her book and creation of a temporary world peace."" OR ""how does General Shang know he needs to tell her all these specific details? It seems to suggest that he is living in same non-linear timeline as her, but if that was the case it wouldn't seem necessary for her to stop him"". There are relatively reasonable explanations that you can invent to justify both of these (and I have), but the point of the matter is that these type of things pop up all over the movie in such a notable way.

I think I understand the emotional aspect of the movie, and the ""if you knew what would happen, and it may be heartbreaking, would you still do it?"" (a la  Eternal Sunshine, one of my favorites), but for these reasons I just couldn't connect with the film. I was constantly stepping out emotionally and logically. All this was made worse with the Tree of Life feel (again, one of my favorites). It reminded me so much of that film, but unlike the Tree of Life, it wrang hollow- especially in direct comparison. Overall it just seemed like the film was reaching for a lot, and didn't fully realize on any aspect to a perfect or near-perfect degree.

It certainly isn't a TERRIBLE film. I wouldn't chose to brand myself or watch it over the latest ""Madea watches as money inexplicably rolls in""

d9wkk4f,"This movie is intuitive to those who perceive insight clearly.

What happens in the future, 3000 years, is the gift.. By then humans are merely among many other life-forms and they need the ""grand unification"" that comes with this new fuller form of communication. They are saved because the humans 3000 years from now saw these beings(and many others already) as a threat and would destroy them because in 3000 years we have the means to(due to technology). But they knew that the only solution to the humans or anyone else and everyone else in the multiverse is unification through shared exact communication(the gift). You have to understand something, this form of communication is more than symbols and language, it is pure perception of motivation in transmission.

What appeared visually in black circles where boundless in time, it was effectively me communicating to you a in a (non-deterministic future) thought, girded in motivation, that is reality at-once(when fully received).
Shang couldn't see the future or past and wasn't lead to do anything; rather, what the aliens told to Louise(through a single black circle visualization) is that there exist a reality ahead of you where you have understood what we are saying at this very moment and the result of that reality leads you to a Gala(or unification ceremony) where you will be greeted by Shang. However, unbeknownst to both parties, the content of the exchange(this wasn't a cognitive process). It is like an unfolding of the message(the determinant details), that is the actual dialog we glimpse, but the transmission was the motivation of a future where their language was perceived and understood(and the actions that proceeded, they the aliens had to speak[through the black visualization] knowing that the message if truely recieved, to this specific person, could shape the present moment for the truth, that they came bearing a gift and not arms).

From a human standpoint you could think of it as this: suppose I ""said""(correction: ""meant"", should be put in place of ""said"", but since we don't perceive transmission of thoughts outside of language, I fail-safe to ""said"") Suppose I ""meant"", there exists a way to unify the people of this planet, I am motivated to not see China attack and know that there exists a future where if everyone understood our true motivations, then the reality that unfolds would lead us to China not attacking. I communicated the meaning that the maximal hope of all our existence is in you perceiving what is being said by what I meant in this very message. By partaking and receiving such meaning, the means of the deterministic future unfold accordingly. That which precedes such events is merely the future outcome that is at-once understood through medium of message, message received fully. This is circular, funny symbology here, but communication is purely hope and transmission of meaning in this form of transmission...

The message, being a black circle, was the maximal hope and realization for what they came to do, to exist through understanding that supersedes natural time as we perceived it(sorry to interject future-past-tense here, as I said in the source below though).

Sorry if this is heavy stuff to understand, but Shang's conversation was the representation of that very message being fully conveyed. Our language does fail to truly represent what I am explaining here, but it is good to touch the iceberg as this was initiated not by me.

d9wrveu,"Looks like I'm that guy. I did not like it. Also, mods, your description is incorrect: Donnelly wasn't a mathematician, he was a theoretical physicist from los alamos. 

It wasn't really enjoyable and I found myself becoming very aware of the fact that I was watching a movie on several occasions and kind of bored throughout. I think this is because they would pick up and abandon many themes. 

While I liked that this was not an alien shotem up, nor some pop-physics sci-fi with a Neil DeGrass Tyson Cameo, I wish they had narrowed the focus more. Do you want to talk about language, or do you want to talk about time? Both are interesting but combing them in the manner seen here feels very incomplete. There are so many fun little linguistic things that they started to show us, only to abandon the theme in the third act and switch over to an exploration of the way time works.

I think that ""soft science"" sci fi could be very interesiting, providing they actually stuck with it, like if she was trying to crack some code that actually went somewhere other than herself. 

If you had missed the line the alien says in subtitles, that the aliens were there so the humans could help them in 3000 years, the movie would make absolutely no sense to you. It's like they just put a bunch of interesting things together without caring about how the fit together.

However I don't think the movie is bad, just that it's not that great. That's what I'm trying to figure the hell out. Everyone has different opinions but I really can't figure out what everyone seems to find so good about this movie. Mostly all the reviews are positive with high scoring. Even IMDB rating is steady at 8.2 points. Can someone provide me some logical insight?",5cc7fb
dciydt8,"This movie was a big disappointment given how highly rated it is. 

The central question of the movie is: ""What is your (aliens) purpose on earth?"" This question is never answered. 

The male lead character was completely useless to the project, other than as a love interest for the female lead character. It would have been better to merge the roles of her husband, the colonel, and the CIA guy into one person, and we wouldn't have missed out on anything.

Also a lot of the lower level details are implausible. If the central plot of the movie was good, then these things wouldn't have mattered, but the central plot was long and drawn out with no conclusions nor payoffs, so you just end up sitting there wondering about these little details. For example, this has to be the most highly classified military site ever, so why are soldier allowed to make personal phone calls and watch youtube on their notebooks? Given the level of chaos and confusion at the site for over a month, leading to a major security breach of the CIA guy just leaving his satellite phone lying around unattended on a desk, why hasn't everybody in charge of this site already been fired and replaced? Where was the US president during all this? And on the Chinese side, why isn't the politbureau meetings being broacast on TV 24/7 like during a real crisis (such as 1989)? Besides, we've learned a lot of these lessons about crisis communications already from real world history, go watch ""13 days"" about the Cuban missile crisis if you want a good movie like this. And why would you rely on a single linguist with a team she never worked with before when the future of humanisty is on the line? It's much more realistic to have many competing teams sharing and analyzing data together, which is what happens in the real world for big science questions.",5cc7fb
dcj702j,"Absolutely hated this movie. The first 40 minutes were compelling and I wanted to see what would unfold. It ended up being long, drawn out with no real answer. So many cuts and flashbacks as if I am supposed to care. The movie just turned into a time paradox. Louise finds out she is going to have a kid and the kid dies... which we already knew from the first minute of the movie. So what was the point of any of this? What was this movie's message? Team work will stop a global catastrophe? What a played out theme. This movie was so fucking lame. At times it tried to be like Interstellar, but at least interstellar was a semi original idea with a real plot line: earth is dying, civilization is ending, no food, etc... then a time paradox was introduced into that movie as well.  
This movie could have been good, it had amazing actors, scenery, and a nice musical score. The plot line was utterly fucked tho.",5cc7fb
d9vfaks,"Great movie. I would pretty much go see any Villenueve movie. Never been disappointed. It almost felt like the stakes were higher in this movie than Interstellar even though humanity was on the verge of extinction. The weight of choosing love and pain, especially pain, just felt more impactful. The only question I have is why is knowing the future a gift? Was the first interpretation correct as well? That it's a weapon as well (see Jeremy Renner's character who chose to leave knowing his daughter's fate)?",5cc7fb

d9w8lg3,"So the overall conclusion of the film is that the alien's form of communication allows them to understand time differently than what us humans do on Earth. It's a very strange concept, that's highly ambitious, but isn't executed that well, other than a brief, face-value explanation. So, like the circular writing style they employ, their lives are able to float nonlinearly. They get to experience time in a nonlinear fashion. This is where the film packs it's emotional gut punch. Once Louise figures out their language, she's also reached a sort of enlightenment that allows her to understand time the way they do. So she knows her daughter will eventually die, and her husband will eventually leave her...but she chooses to do it anyway. She chooses to get married and have her daughter, because the short time she has with them is worth the pain and heartache of losing them. It's very very dark, depressing, and tragic. And that's the best thing about this film. Just the path to get to this understanding is a little labor intensive and unexciting for the viewer.",5cc7fb

1} If all 0.83333' parts were put together, is that their entire language or alphabet? And if so, if you understood that entire globule of language does that enable you to traverse your entire life, experiencing any point at any time? Does this also mean the language is perceived differently for every person that understands it? enabling each individual person to traverse their own entire life? for e.g does the heptapod word have different meanings for different people?

2} Why did the shells leave as soon as the humans fire power was turned away?

3} Why is Hannah able to know about 'her mummy and daddy talking to animals' and make the heptapods out of play dough?

4} Is the heptapods language palindromes?

5} Why does the Chinese leader say ""here is my private number, I think this will be important"" what causes him to do this?

6} Does the word weapon mean something different for heptapods?

7} Does learning the word for ""hannah"" for example enable you to experience being that person more clearly. Like when louis touches the ink and then is able to ask hannah was day it is?

8} When you travel with you mind into the future does your current body just pass out on the ground?

9} Why did the shells rotate 180 degrees and lay flat?

10} The shells dissapearing at the end, does this signify they traveled to the future using their language?

Any answers is greatly appreciated :)",5cc7fb
d9zbga9,"The move reminded me of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  There are many similar themes.

Another big theme in the movie is non-zero sum games.  Zero sum games work very well in capitalism and in theory help the best products and services to come forward at the best price.  But a non-zero sum game, that isn't true and only cooperation between the players can lead to the best outcome.  Example climate change.

d9zdn3w,"In the perspective of this movie, there a roadblocks in time that cannot be prevented.  In the case of Louise, this was her child's cancer.  I believe that the aliens are going through a similar roadblock in their world, and maybe in 3000 years they want to live with humans in Earth.  They see that their world is going to end in the near future, and by going to Earth at the time of the movie, they are preparing themselves to move into a new world (in this case Earth).  It makes sense, because Louise was able to survive in the atmosphere that the aliens live in.  Hence, both atmospheres should be habitable for both species. ",5cc7fb

From its score and visual spectacle all the way to its important building blocks of the relationship between a child and their parent.

I did have some issues with the inclusion of the rogue soldiers deciding to blow-up the spaceship and Adam‚Äôs character entering the pod via a smaller ship and seemingly not getting questioned soon after. It‚Äôs definitely nowhere near the level of Prisoners or Sicario but it‚Äôs definitely on par with Enemy.

I have one question for more observant folks, or if it's mentioned in the story: if the environment inside the space craft took a while to prepare for humans to withstand, and they needed a canary to ensure they weren't about to get poisoned or suffocated - how come Louise can enter the aliens' environment with seemingly no ill-effects (other than looking like she's in a hair commercial but they put the wind machine up a bit too high)?

Would this be more an effect of gravity or air pressure, than the composition of gases, then? The heptapods, who look like pretty solid meaty creatures, were able to float around like jellyfish when they wanted to.

One was how different the girl kept looking at different ages, and second was that apparently in the future they also found the key to agelessness because Amy Adams didn't age at all during those flashforward scenes.

d9ytx4w,"I just saw the movie and overall it was good ... -ish. 
Halfway through the movie, can't remember the exact moment, I realised that the visions were not past memories but in fact future memories and from there I only needed Louise to mention that the father was a scientist to figure out that Ian was the father. 

One thing that bugged me was the ending. It seemed too long, like it was inserted for the sole purpose to add minutes to the movie and a bit too melodramatic for my taste . 


What made me get up and leave the cinema, but at that point it was pointless since the movie was already in its last minutes, was the paradox which was clearly introduced as an 'Ex Machina' plot device. The more I think about it the more my head starts to hurt, but it's understandable since all things time related give me a headache.

Loise is able to see the future (daughters disease), because she learnt the aliens language. I get it, but why is Loise seeing her daughters dead and disease since the beginning of the movie, when she never had seen an alien before, even less learn their language and understaing of time.

da09i7o,"So scanning through this thread, I feel like I'm in the extreme minority here, but I was very underwhelmed by this movie. Here are some of my issues, maybe someone can help sway me because I just don't understand the praise this movie is getting.

I found the central conflict to feel contrived an unrealistic. The Heptapods showed no signs of aggression and were clearly making an attempt to communicate, but the world suddenly decides they want to initiate a first strike against far more advanced race the moment they translate a phrase to say ""Offer Weapon""?  I firmly believe that humans have a high propensity to act stupid, but this still didn't buy that. 

The way the movie breaks down communication and the methods Louise used to communicate with the Heptapods felt deeply unscientific and frankly didn't make much sense. They make a big point to say that it's really difficult to ask the question of ""Why is the purpose for the Heptapods coming to Earth"" and act as if they have to establish a significant amount of language before they can even ask that question. I'm pretty sure ""Why here?"" is all you'd need to say to get that question across, not to mention that the advanced aliens should obviously know that that would be the first question that the human's would want to know.

On top of that, the aliens arrive with seemly no plans to method to communicate with humans and leave it entirely up to them to figure it out. It makes even less sense when they later explain that the Heptapods experience time non-linearly, so frankly they should already know how to communicate with people. Saying that they need our help in 3000 years is a complete hand wave that doesn't explain at all why they're here now. They seem to want to bestow the ability to think non-linearly to humans, but why? What were the stakes of any of this?

The cinematography was beautiful, but the alien ships barely did anything so 90% of it is still just cool shots of the one ship floating over Montana or in the one room of the ship we ever saw. The score was good, but the main theme I loved wasn't original to the film. I just heard it recently in The Leftovers, and it just made me think of that show instead.

The characters were pretty thin and not that engaging. The big twist/reveal actually surprised me and it was interesting, but it made me realize that the one thing I thought I knew about Louise wasn't even part of her character yet. The love story between her and Renner was so understated that it kind of took me by surprise at the end of the film when they got together.

In general just some odd editing choices. The one that stood out the most for me was that we don't actually get to see Louise's first interaction with the Heptapods. They draw out this long scene of them entering the ship, and the moment the Heptapods appear the movie cuts to them back outside the ship, taking their gear off. What? How do we not get to see their first interactions with each other?

I really wanted to like this movie, but these issues really got in the way for me. Am I just crazy and nitpicking? I don't really see anyone sharing my point of view on this yet.",5cc7fb

dbaskdr,"This movie took major props from Contact, as duly noted below. Spoilers follow. I also really liked Arrival, but by and large Contact was all over that movie to be fair:

- Jodie Foster's relative dies early in the movie and is revisited via a flashbacks. Same with Amy Adam's character.

- Foster has a ""science vs faith"" romantic interest. Adams has a ""science vs liberal arts"" romantic interest.

- Big Government is constantly pressuring Foster and nearly taking her project away from her, same with Adams.

- Foster and team spend a good portion of the movie decrypting a signal sent from aliens. Same with Adams.

- In Contact, a subversive group tries to blow up machine and individuals die. Same in Arrival.

- In the book Contact, the message they finally decrypt is pi (a circle that appears on the screen in binary form; this doesn't make an appearance in the movie, but it is the culmination of the book). In arrival the aliens are also communicating via circles.

The animal has zero to do with the plot yet is focused on several times throughout. For a movie that is so horribly paced, why waste time on that? Also, did Louise get affected by taking off her suit and passed on something to the kid? We never find out who the aliens are, why they look like space squids, what they'll need from us in 3k years, or where they are from. CGI Amy Adams looked worse than CGI Leia. Writers missed out by not having Renner also say no when asked if pregnant. The inability to hear the dialogue over random tech sounds or helicopters. How does the bomb smash through the barrier and kill Costello? Why is the President never involved. Why don't the aliens stay and teach us their advanced technology? Why does Amy Adams constantly have to breathe heavily and keel over to display confusion & anxiety? Why is the woman the only one who's shaking the whole time during 1st contact? The classroom scene was a joke. Made no sense that she just went home to hangout after finding out. Made no sense that she went back to work the next day. Clearly schools gonna be closed for a while. Then the whole part about a group of military personnel going rogue because they listen to an Alex Jones show. Again I like the message conveyed, wasn't a fan of how they went about doing it.

d9ws0zs,"Definitely enjoyed it but went a bit high and, regrettably, kinda zoned out during the mother-daughter sequences.

d9wuira,Can someone explain the explosives part to me. I'm going to watch it again and I must have missed a crucial bit of information. Why did they decide to place the explosives on the ship? and why did they let Ian and Louise go on board knowing that the explosives had been set?,5cc7fb
d9wusgc,"Something that seems trippy is Louise's initial memory sequence of her daughter to start the film (which makes us think it's in her past). Looking back at it, the movie gives the indication that she's remembering and processing something that happened. We later learn that she's seeing ""memories"" of the future, but what's trippy or weird to me is that she's seeing those future memories before she even goes and meets the aliens. She perceived time linearly before her ""ahah"" moment, but she learned she was perceiving it non-linearly the whole time!  Makes me wonder how ""long"" she was having ""memories"" of her ""future"" daughter ""before"" she understood and didn't think it was weird to think those thoughts. But that's also the point. Everything in quotes is all relative, and her ""ahah"" moment isn't relatively in the future because it's in the past, present, and future simultaneously. (Whew, it's really hard not to ramble when trying to unpack the movie.)",5cc7fb
d9wvo1c,"Favorite thing about this movie is : 

The Gift the heptapods are giving is for human to learn a language that enable them to see their entire life (and more). That kinda cool, sure, but you have to live with all the burdens it comes with.

It's really nice to imagine what would happen to humanity after they recieved this gift.",5cc7fb

And those dreams/visions she was having was actually the aliens communicating to her within her dreams, subtly teaching her the language...?",5cc7fb

d9x36lj,"I love this site, just discovered. So many facets to this film but just looking at the love story It didn't make sense to me that Ian would leave Louise because she told him of their daughters disease. He fell in love basically with her mind. He trusted her in the face of bullets. Why would he leave her? If Louise had not told her daughter the reason he left was that she told him about an unstoppable disease, I could have conjured tons of the typical reasons people split up. But working on just what the movie told us, it isn't consistent to me. ",5cc7fb
d9x6an4,"Could someone please explain this movie to me? I had to leave around the part where Louise and Costello met face-to-face and my friend just told me what happened afterwards.

Please help!",5cc7fb
d9xaebm,"Loved it. Great naturalistic cinematography in the first third of the film, very much like first third of Close Encounters, loved seeing a more complete and complex female lead character, loved the Timeywimey aspect. Only one criticism, very end sequence could've been edited more, it was a bit too long for 'yeh, we get it now'. So, 9.99 out of 10.

I'm still really confused by that since it came out last year and is already on DVD. I feel like maybe someone fucked up and meant to put the Manchester by the Sea trailer or something. I'm not sure I've ever seen a trailer before for a movie thats already out.",5cc7fb
d9xclkr,"So we were trying to figure out the future of Ian as the husband. For almost all of Louis's flash forwards she is a alone as a parent. Obviously a big part of this was done to hide the fact that they're flash forwards and not flashbacks. But in the one where Louis tells her daughter that daddy went away, did he leave for good or did he just run away temporarily out of grief/anger/emotion?

In any of the flash forward shots of the dying daughter, I think remember there only being Louis present, no one else (except, of course, the daughter). 

What do you guys think? Does Ian later leave Louis because she could see that their daughter would get sick and die and she chose to have her anyway? Or is he hidden from most all flash forward scenes simply to hide that critical plot component?",5cc7fb

d9xlk4g,"Wait, so the flash ""forwards"" of her daughter... Were they happening because future her already learned the alien language/time nonsense? Like, she didn't figure out that that was what was happening until towards the end of the movie, but since she eventually DOES learn and time is nonlinear in the movie, I'm trying to figure out of she had some kind of future powers the whole time, or if she has future powers because the future powers make time not matter.

Does that make sense? Do the movie's early flash forward scenes happen because of what will eventually happen to her when she learns the language?",5cc7fb

When Louise is talking to General Shang in the future, and he gives her his phone number and his wife's dying words, surely that meeting could only happen if Louise stops the General from declaring war. However, Louise can only stop the war with what she can learn after she has already stopped it.",5cc7fb

d9zfh7q,"Just saw the film and I feel like I either missed something or I'm just not getting the importance of what the film tried to convey, so hopefully you guys can clarify:

* As I understand it, the aliens are trying to teach this language to humans that somehow allows them to see into the future; why are they trying to do this? How does teaching humanity this language in turn help the aliens in 3000 years?

* We see Louise teaching the alien language to a class of students at the end. Is everyone who learns this lanuage able to see into their future?

* Are people able to alter their future to their liking after seeing it?

* How exactly does learning this language actually translate to suddenly being able to see your future? Do visions just sporadically appear, or is it supposed to be more controlled?

* This last one is more of a statment than question. Louise's visions of the future seemed very natural and normal, as though she was just living life, but when we see the future visions where she is talking to the Chinese military leader it comes across as very unnatural as he randomly just gives her everything she needs to save the day. It came across as merely a cheap plot device to save the world. 

If anyone could shed some clarity on these it would be much appreciated.",5cc7fb
d9zjqi8,"A wonderfully shot and finely crafted sci fi thriller about the power of language. One of the most intensely dramatic sci fi movies I have seen, everything that the heptapods did had me on the edge of my seat. It was interesting to read other reviews, like the one in the New Yorker, which discussed how the directing was deliberately designed to keep the heptopods mysterious.

It does always frustrate me in these first contact movies that seeemingly all alien species choose to be cryptic and vague about what they have to offer humanity. Was the ""map"" that Abbott left behind a map to the heptapod's home star?",5cc7fb
d9zjrrq,"Just got out of the theater. Awesome movie! 

However, does anyone else feel like the last five minutes was tacked on? 

Honestly Would've liked it more if it ended with Louise vo of her daughter's sorry starting now on the shot of her empty house. 

Feel like everything after that (her hugging Ian, asking him bout life, more flash forwards) was all tacked on by the studio to give better conclusion. Ruined the ""circle"" theme that was the movie. Aha",5cc7fb
d9zpw43,Can anyone explain the significance of all the ships laying flat?,5cc7fb
d9zwosv,"Okay, I created an account for the soul purpose of discussing this movie and a theory I have not read yet and I need to discuss with those that have seen it. Spoilers ahead. (Theory starts 5th paragraph)

SO the aliens came to earth because they needed help 3000 years from the time they arrive. The only way they could get that help is to teach us a language that will help us advance more quickly. 

For those that think she has no choice but to live the life she is seeing, I'm not entirely sure that is accurate. The whole point of learning the language (the gift/weapon) is to learn a lifetime worth of knowledge in a day or a short amount of time. This would in turn change the future we are seeing into a now alternate future. 

To me all the above is for the most part the facts of the movie. I loved this movie, but there was one thing that bothered me and that was the phone call with General Shang. Now she can't change the past but she is able to alter the present with knowledge of the future. However, to see that future events had to have taken place. 

Sorry it took so long to get here, but here's my theory. That party she goes to is 18 months after China and those that followed indeed FIRED on the aliens. This is not an alien invasion movie. They came to us in need of help. So once fired upon they left. They still gave us everything we needed to then study the language and learn it. So everything she saw still applies. Including the white flag with the alien symbol, because the planet later learned they came to help and to be helped. 

So now the party. The General comes for the sole purpose to tell her that she needs to convince him to not fire. He starts, "" I don't know how your mind works."" I believe he is hoping she can change the past. IF she indeed called him there would be no reason to show her his private number and then whisper to her what his passed wife once told him. Which now I understand was, ""War does not make winners, only Widows.""

She uses this knowledge of an alternate (but current/inevitable) timeline to change, her current time line. He gave her exactly what she needed to convince him into something that nobody else is capable of convincing him. I believe he said nobody has ever been able to convince him except for her. 

With her calling and stopping him, we now live in a world that had now war to create widows and probably more importantly a world we human and aliens have no bad blood now or 3000 years from now.

Maybe a little added nugget, the last trailer of the movie at the very end there is a scene of a aircraft firing missiles over the ocean. This is never shown in the movie. 

Let me know if my theory adds up or if it falls apart somehow somewhere.",5cc7fb
da02pgf,"I never expected this movie to be a hard sci-fi Slaughterhouse 5.  

Both use a similar mechanism of being ""unstuck in time"" to make commentaries on the value of the experience of living a life.  They come to slightly different conclusions and Arrival has a lot more focus on the process, obviously.  

What is funny is that when the movie was wrapping up I felt that it could have been a few minutes shorter.  It seemed like the movie wasn't sure it explained everything enough, so it kept giving examples.  I thought ""We get it, you gave us the punch, explained the mechanics explicitly, now leave us spinning"". Sure enough, the movie ends and the person I was with still didn't get exactly what was going on with the child, so i guess it was needed.  Perhaps I take in too much sci-fi.

I loved it.  I only wish that the sad-time music wasn't so overwrought in the final flash-forwards to her child.  ",5cc7fb

What is the best 30-seconds-max clip that could be used to play during the Oscars to sum up the beauty and power of her performance? 

My contender is her response when the daughter says, 'he (daddy)  doesn't look at me the way you do' and she explains why she thinks it's her fault etc. Struggling to explain difficult concepts to a child in an appropriate way.",5cc7fb
da10qnn,"This film was incredible. I hadn't heard of it until the day before I went to see it, and I was floored by how beautiful it was - both in the cinematography and the story. I love the shot where Louise and her students are watching the news but they're staring into the camera and you can only hear what's happening. I also love the story. The beginning was so heartbreaking, and the end is too but in a different way. Louise chose to have her daughter, not because it's her destiny because the heptapods showed her what would happen, but because she knows the love she feels for her daughter is worth the pain she feels knowing she will die too young. This movie is now one of my top ten favorites. ",5cc7fb
da12297,"I found the third act a bit of a mess and just convenient deus ex machina, and at some points like the first meeting with the aliens, it just abruptly cuts off to another scene. But the cinematography is great obviously, Denis Villeneuve is solid as usual. Personally I found Amy Adams' performance pretty stiff. Was a bit laughable how it was China and Russia who were viewed as aggressors and America the pioneers. I'm sure another viewing would iron out some of my problems with the film, but I'm not thinking too much about this film.

da1q4ii,"My friend makes an interesting argument for the heptapods communicating in dreams in that not only was she seeing her future in her flash forwards, but the heptapods are actively manipulating her there as well. In her dreams, Louise is sometimes herself and the heptapods are Hannah and vice versa. For example, when she goes to get back on the shell and has the vision of Hannah telling her to wake up, she (Louise) is the child waking up the mother (heptapods) to talk. 

He argued that there's no other explanation for a heptapod showing up in her dream other than to show that they're in her head (unless it's a throwaway scene which I don't know if there is such a thing in this movie.)

I don't know if I necessarily agree with it, but I found it to be an interesting theory nonetheless.",5cc7fb

2 lines were brutally obvious though and completely brought me out of it: ""It's your phone, sir"" and ""then I met you""

A bit ham-handed, Right?",5cc7fb
da2g97c,"Wow. I interpreted the movie way different from everyone else here. There are a lot of moving parts, so bear with me. I'll sum it up as concisely as I can here:

1) Louise was telling her story to us after it happened. We were not watching the events unfold in the same linear fashion that the characters were in the movie. 

2) As we witness the story unfold, we are led to believe that she already had the daughter and lost her because we learn about Hannah's existence in the beginning of the movie. (Kind of playing with the audience because we still perceive time as linear.) Truth is, Louise was not experiencing flash backs, but fast forwards. They grow in intensity and clarity as she begins interacting with the beings.

3) Anyways, the beings (probably interdimensional) visit earth to save us from ourselves ‚Äî knowing that our species would help theirs in the future. It would have made more sense if they opened the movie with news coverage of worldwide conflicts, destablization, distrust between nations, and an unwillingness to communicate with each other and work together. This theme was expressed throughout the movie, though. (I just think it would have been better if the monologue about Hannah came after.)

4) So these beings set up around the world and are actually seeking out Louise because she has a ""weapon"". Her weapon is her expertise in language. They knew that humans would need to get on the same damn page if we were to save our species from ourselves. 

5) Here's the crazy part. Louise wrote the book, ""The Universal Language"". This wasn't the aliens' language, this was HER LANGUAGE. The aliens were trying to communicate to her in the universal language that SHE made up! The clues are when she flashes forward to when she opens the box and sees the circular symbol on one of the opening pages. The aliens' concept of time is not linear, so they knew about her universal language and how it could unite the universe. Furthermore, this explains why she was suddenly able to read the entire screen of symbols when the military was beginning to evacuate... She wrote the damn thing!

6) As time became less linear, she was able to learn of events before they happened to help her rewrite the future and alter our impending doom. This was seen at the gala with all the world's flags and leaders present. Thus, her actions eventually saved and unified the world.

7) Still deciding to have Hannah, even after all she learned, was just a personal choice she would have to make. It really didn't have bearing on the world or the story, just her life. Louise asks Ian, ""If you could see your entire life's timeline, would he change anything?"" It's obvious she was already thinking about the consequences of having Hannah. She chose love, even if it would be taken from her too soon. P.S.: Hannah's name is symbolic of being at two opposite places in time but converging in the middle. This explains how the past and future met to help her decide on what action she needed to take in the present.

TL;DR: The aliens sought out a linguist who would unite the world and prevent its distruction. Louise's ""weapon"" was her ability to communicate through her skills and a universal language that she made up ‚Äî it wasn't the aliens' langauge at all! The flash forwards helped her realize this and save the world from its own distruction.",5cc7fb
da2px8g,"I probably enjoyed thinking, talking, and reading about the movie after i saw it more than actually watching it. I couldnt help but think are there alien contact movies that dont involve a hysterical military response and/or the necessity for humanity to communicate with each in order to avoid annihilation/war? Contact, arguably. Close Encounters maybe. That side of the story is too un-original. Fortunately, the linguistics, time, and memory side of the story was superb. I also found Louise and Ian barely likeable which considering the importance of their 'future' relationship was a bit disheartening. Abbot and Costello had a more meaningful onscreen relationship, for christsakes! Presumably L&I's relationship had to be hidden from the future memories/experiences narrative in order to preserve the suspense that they were future memories. I still really enjoyed it though, and reading a lot of everyone's observations here has greatly improved my appreciation of the movie. And Forest Whitaker is fucking great.",5cc7fb
da2zblu,"I need help understanding something. From what I've read after viewing the movie I understand that her ability to see the future happened when she started learning the alien language. How does the movie open with these future memories, then, if she hadn't yet met the aliens?

da4gsof,"I just finished the short story the movie was based on, and I believe the nature of the alien's perception was changed in the movie. *story spoiler*

In the story, Louise states that individuals who know the future don't talk about it. Even though free will exists, they don't use their knowledge to change the future, just to actualize it. Knowledge of the future does not change their behavior.  It is hinted that the aliens' consciousness exists in all times at once, and that since Louise is human she can only do this rarely and usually she's only conscious in the present while seeing the future as a memory. She does not use the ability to change events like she did in the movie, those scenes did confuse me when i first saw it. I am guessing in the movie she uses the perception  to change the future like she did with the phone call. The movie makes me wonder at their lifespan: they state about events thousands of years into the future, yet they can only perceive events that they themselves experience.  ",5cc7fb

But I have one question: The dream sequence...... we see one of the alien beings in the corner  (a fantastic reworking of Villeneuve's Enemy spider shot)- but what does it mean?  Why is she dreaming about Abott and Costello? I initially thought at the time....here we go ...... the whole alien story is a metaphor for her dealing with the actual death of her child. But as the movie pans out it seems that's not the case. So why the dream?  Every single thing in this movie has a purpose.

I think the movie borrowed heavily from Kurt Vonnegut's books 'Slaughterhouse 5' and 'Sirens of Titan'. There is an alien race in those books called Tralfamadorians (ty wikipeida) who share a similar worldview and concept of time as Arrival's Septopods. Both alien races take from the great H.P. Lovecraft who helped establish the 'Cosmic Horror"" genre. The idea that humanity is utterly insignificant compared to other life in the universe. Also, tentacles. Lots of tentacles.

Sagan, Vonnegut, Lovecraft, Amy Adams and Hawkeye. What's not to like? Great music and sound effects too. Some of those ideas need time to settle in but the pacing may have been a little slow for me.

Then when it lands the lights bathe the whole house and it's surroundings, much like in your stereotypical alien movie when a UFO lands and everything is drenched in blinding light. THEN when Louise opens the door, the colonel is standing there. He's very tall and his front is completely shadowed, making him appear non human.

daecqta,"I teared up on my drive home thinking about the movie.  A couple takeaways for me:

- I've been flippant in the past about potential parents having the power to abort their fetus.  The idea is if screening detects severe mental retardation or defect, it makes practical sense to delete the baby and start over.  After this film, though, I think it's much deeper than that.  I don't think I could ever abort or stop the existence of Hannah, because despite the tragic ending, there was a lot of beauty in her life, and she deserved to live.  Even if it means poisoning the marriage which causes the spouse to leave.  Also I thought with knowledge of the future, it's irresponsible to get rid of someone who could have been the next Ray Charles, Stephen Hawkins, or Geordi La Forge (fictional, but he's spoken about how it's no one's right to abort him for being blind).

- the film makes a powerful argument that knowing the future actually limits your free will and gets you to resign to predeterminism.  That's because for Louise to be successful in uniting the world, many pieces including tragedy needed to happen for all the pieces to fit.  Just like how General Chang's willingness to stand down came from tragedy, because his wife told him there are only widows in war.  If she decided to tweak anything, maybe it knocks the timeline out of whack and the world is ruined.  So she's resigned to her fate. ",5cc7fb
daefdx5,"This was without a doubt one of the most beautiful sci-fi films I've ever seen.

The story was engaging.  The ""bad guys"" weren't really bad guys - they were just misguided, close-minded characters who thought they were doing the right thing.  Certain shots were strangely stunning - like the scene with Dr. Banks and her students all watching the news about the visitors, or that very first shot of the vessel hovering over Montana while mist rolled in over the mountains.

And I'm not too ashamed to admit that the core message and the way the final scenes drove it home had me in tears.

daeuqow,"Ok, I'm seriously confused by the love for this movie now, because when I walked out what I felt like I saw was an M. Knight Shyamalan rejected script. Before you reach for the downvote, hear me out.

1) **Suspension of Disbelief**  
Signs is ridiculed for trying to convince us that aliens would invade a planet with massive amounts of water that they are completely vulnerable to, but in Arrival I'm expected to believe a race of oracle like octopuses who's survival depends for some reason on humans being able to learn their language couldn't come up with a clever line of dominoes stacked up to fall into the best outcome for the aliens (heck one of them dies because of the explosion they chose to allow to happen) instead it's a barely cohesive set of events that let Amy Adams act sad for half the movie to make us think she is a grieving mother in shock instead of a emotionless husk of a teacher with no purpose. 

2)**Jeremy Renner**  
Tell me what exactly Jeremy Renner's character did in this movie? In the handful of scenes where we actually get to see the two of them together he is either a) playing assistant to Amy Adams genius (because for some reason in twelve different countries the best and brightest minds never thought once of writing something down on a whiteboard) b) crooning Amy Adams' praise for the remarkable breakthroughs she's made or c) Worrying about Amy's health. Also the ""most surprising thing""line at the end of the movie was the most cringe worthy cliche ever. Other than a romantic foil, and a source of sperm, what did he contribute to the film? Heck his big moment of ""genius"" consists of him translating the time rune and claiming the offering was FTL travel, a ""stupid character says something stupid that inspires the genius"" cliched moment.

3)**Taking the Sci out of Sci-Fi**  
Look I don't need the science in a film to comply with reality, but for a movie who's premise is two brilliant scientists learning to speak an alien language, the movie goes from ""Hey lets try writing instead of shouting at the aliens"" to "" We now have a translation software that can roughly translate their written text on the fly"" in almost two scenes. Take the aliens out completely replace it with Amy Adams translating a magical book that makes her understand how to see the future where she chooses to suffer the pain of loss of her future daughter rather than avoid it and tell me what fundamentally changes in the movies message other than being able to pretend it's an action film?

The pacing was very slow for almost the entire movie which I did not like that much. Amy's portrayal was good and I liked her character. Renner's character was not fleshed that much and I would have liked to see more of a meaningful interaction from him.
The twist at the end was utterly unbelievable. They took the fiction to some other level which seems completely unplausible. Once the twist is revealed the last 15 minutes of the movie move at a pace which is fine. The choices made by the main character do not make a lot of sense after the reveal. The script was just not convincing enough. The direction on the other hand was great and the visuals and sound effects were great. It was great direction but the story simply lacked direction, It calls itself an intelligent sci fi movie but the choices made by the main character do not make much sense. Piecing together what happened prior to the twist you notice several scenes if you are attentive and that was extremely satisfying. Overall a good one time watch for the great direction.",5cc7fb

dahcwfc,"This post is spoiler heavy. Instead of using a spoiler thing on the whole post, I thought I'd just mention it here. I just came back from seeing Arrival and I'm honestly surprised when I read about how emotionally moved people were from watching this movie. Overall, I found Arrived to be an incredibly mixed bag. I found parts of the movie to be compelling and then others to be sub-par.

Arrival's strongest material involves its extraterrestrial characters. Any science fiction clich√© is avoided and it presents us with a stellar depiction of life from other planets. Their ships, design, and language are all cool concepts that stand out in the best way possible. Instead of a stereotypical UFO, the Heptapods travel in these mysterious rock-like vessels that hover and defy Earth's gravity. Their written language is easily the best conceived fictional tongue in years. The scene when it's first introduced is so striking because it plays into that sense of mystery. At first, we can't tell what they're doing and it raises the suspense. 

My biggest problems with this movie involve the main characters, Louise and Ian. They're just not interesting or worth following. Aside from her motivation to decode the Heptapods language, I can't think of any distinct character traits she has. She loves her kid like every other normal fictional mother. But what makes her stand out? Their romance is forced almost instantly and leaves the audience with no choice but to accept it because the plot requires it.  When Ian's character was first introduced, I assumed his background in physics would be used as a foil to Louise's expertise in linguistics. And this would've been a great way to have us learn about their characters. Mostly when they speak, their lines serve as exposition that just moves the plot forward with the least amount of personality possible. Instead of having the characters be foils of each other, they just automatically fall in love with each other and we barely see them bond or connect with each other. The climactic height of their love at the end of the movie is one of the most cringe-inducing moments I've seen in a movie. Ian's line where he asks Louise ""Do you want to make a baby together?"" is one of the most unnatural phrases I've heard in a film. People just don't speak like that. 

My last and largest gripe involves the film's central twist. The Heptapods do not experience time in a linear fashion like we do and they pass this ability on to Louise to ensure humanity's survival. This survival is threatened by the Chinese and Russian governments because they feel threatened by the alien's message. Flashforwards are cleverly peppered throughout its two hour running time. It demonstrates to us how these aliens might perceive time through Louise. Louise only saves Earth because she sees her future where she talks to the Chinese general about how she changed his mind about declaring war on the Heptapods. This leaves us with a big logical question. If the Heptapods can perceive the future before it happens, then why did they send one of their vessels to China? Why even bother with twelve ships if they only need to encounter Louise? If they hypothetically didn't send a ship to China, then that entire scenario where the Chinese declare war is completely avoided. The film never explains to us why they'd do something so reckless if they can see the future. 
I‚Äôve seen the word ‚Äúphilosophical‚Äù used to describe this film, but I disagree. While the idea of experiencing time in a non-linear fashion is philosophical, this film doesn‚Äôt do it much justice. It appears towards the end of the film and it ultimately culminates in that cheesy line where Ian asks Louise if she would do any of her life differently. While its main function is to save the day, Arrival never really muses on the idea. We don‚Äôt see the other implications of experiencing time like this. Philosophically, it‚Äôs the equivalent of a shower thought. Brief, interesting, and then quickly forgotten.

But that's just my opinion. Feel free to disagree with me or explain why I'm wrong. I'd love to hear it. I think the best discussions need to include the minority opinions.
",5cc7fb
dahuh4y,"Now Ian was studying the language alongside Louise, right? So shouldn't he have also learned to see visions of the future? Louise was the only one experiencing this, but shouldn't it have been happening to everyone involved in decoding the language? In which case, Ian should have also seen their marriage and loss of Hannah coming. 

Not only should Ian have experienced future visions, but all of the people around the world learning this language. I assume each country had their own linguist like Louise communicating with the Heptapods, so there must have been several people like Louise around the world that were seeing visions of the future.",5cc7fb

This deserves as much praise as a movie can possibly be given. ",5cc7fb
dai62li,"I would love some feedback on a theory of discontinuity within the movie ""Arrival"". Obviously, there were subliminal scientific messages within the movie one regarding how we experience time linearly. Granted, more movies have been grasping with this thought and how time may be manipulated, experienced differently, or altered. E.g ""Interstellar"", ""Primer"", etc. 

The premise of the movie suggests that by understanding the language, you are able to conceptualize time as non-linear. The gift that the heptapods wanted to give the humans was the ability to experience time as they do, and would eventually come to their aid. If we conceive time as being pre-destined, then there would be legitimate reason to believe there is no free will. However, if we are to look at time as one with free will, than the sacrifices both  Abbot and Louise were for the betterment of a larger picture. Costello stayed behind when Abbot left to pass on the 1/12th of the language and to stop them from being blown up. He was pointing, understanding he would die because even if you knew your death you'd more than likely try and prevent it. Louise made the sacrifice of continuing her life with Ian and Hannah because she understood that it was the necessary future for her to have in order to prevent the war from happening. A sacrifice. 
 
At the end of ""Arrival"", Louise stands atop a balcony in a red dress with flags draped on the wall behind her. As the camera pans, you see the flag of the heptapods and assume that the war was prevented. However, Louise does not remember the phone call that she had with General Shang regarding the prevention of a war between the heptapods and the humans. She would have remembered that. Was **THAT** timeline one of post war? One where Shang would seek her out and would know exactly what to tell her to prevent **HIM** from going to war? The mandarin he tells her translates to ""War does not make winners, only widows."" Could Shang's wife have died during the war with the aliens and by acknowledging his and Louise's ability to see time as non-linear he gave her his private phone number so she could use that knowledge during the negotiations and change the timeline? Or was it simply flawed writing and a discontinuity?

My question is. How would she get the information that she needed from Shang to stop the war if the timeline we witnessed was one of pre-war.",5cc7fb

dai9yx8,"Awesome movie. Reading through the comments I haven't seen this theory brought up at all.  

From the final conversion Louise and Ian have outside the base I thought that Ian had the same ability to see future events that Louise had too.  Or he at least knew they get together and have a child.  Two things stand out to me.  First when she asks him if he knew the future would he change anything about it.  Without even a 'huh?' He says something like he would express his feelings more.  Which to me sounds like he's already giving himself relationship advice on a future relationship.  More impotently when they are hugging at the end he says to her 'lets make a baby', meaning he knows the future and wants to go through with it too.  Otherwise its just a uncharacteristically corny line and makes her seem like kind of a bitch for making a major life decision for him.  

Now I know Louis tells Hanna that they split up because she withheld something from him.  Presumably Hannah dying from some rare disease.  Even if Ian could see into the future he might not have known everything, and not telling your husband you know your daughter is going to die from a rare disease seems divorce worthy.  Also Ian asks her earlier if shes been dreaming in their language, a little hint towards the audience whats happening but could also mean he's having similar dreams.  I mean she doesn't really figure it out until the end either, and they never confide in each other that their having weird dreams.

After thinking back through this, did anybody else find parallels between this and The Butterfly Effect from 2004 with Ashton Kutcher?

By no means am I comparing the storyline or the quality of the movies, but when she has those 'flashbacks', they are similar to when Evan Treborn returns to his youth during the blackouts that he had.

-Evan would remember the period of his blackout and then go back to then, act in a certain way and then return to an altered present.

-Louise would 'remember' things that will happen in the future which then enable her to also alter the present.

Essentially one 'travelled' back in time to alter the present and the other 'travelled' forward in time to alter the present.

I really thought this concept in Arrival was amazing and only really caught on when she was in the glass tank with the heptapods discussing time.

Thinking it this way explains why the aliens knew what's going to happen in the future but had to in the present make sure that humans learns the language so that they can help 3000 years later instead of just preventing it from happening at all. Because they can't change it. The structure, like a building has already been designed in a way that it requires certain elements to work together to hold it up. If the future is the roof of a building, it requires the past as the walls to hold the roof up. Or if the structure is a soccer ball, and the past present and future are each pieces of leather that forms the whole ball, one of it changed or missing the ball will fall apart.

So when time is a structure, or the universe if you like, you can't change it without breaking it and redesigning the whole thing. You can only follow the design and mend or build the elements you need. And that's why they chose to live their life the way it is designed. Now if there's no architect to design it, like life, that the structure of time, the universe from beginning to end  just happened and evolved to how it was, is and will be. ",5cc7fb

I'd like to tackle the 'can she / can't she change the future'. I think that gaining the ability to perceive time non-linearly would allow you to manipulate events occurring only after the ability is obtained, no time travel, and only in ways which directly relate to your life. 

Metaphorically, using only our three perceived dimensions as an example, let's say you gain knowledge of a new mountain you've never heard of. This knowledge does not suddenly give you the ability to physically move the mountain, even though mass is understood within our perception, but now that you know of its existence, you can go visit it, thereby providing a possibility to change your future from the path it was on before you knew about the mountain. 

However, you could venture to say that if you were friggin' determined to move that mountain, with planning, the right tools, and a lot of people with the same idea (remember 1 of 12), you could move that mountain. Relate the mountain to the Heptapod's problem in 3,000 years and we have an over-simplified version of this lovely movie.",5cc7fb

[1.) Why does Ian eventually leave Louise in the future? From what I gathered, it had something to do with how she knew Hannah was going to die? When exactly did Ian leave Louise, before or after Hannah's death?](#spoiler)

[2.) I am guessing the ""3000 years"" is not exactly 3000 years in regards to how we perceive time, because of the whole non-linear time aspect, so it could be sooner, or could be later. So does that mean Abbott dies? What's killing Abbott?](#spoiler)

I just wanna ask, at which part in the movie did this happen? I could not find a scene that shows this. When did the aliens say they will need our help in 3,000 yrs? 
I'm assuming it's the scene when she goes into the ship alone and Castello shows her a bunch of circles. But how did the audiences understand it means ""i will need your help in 3000 years""?",5cc7fb
dhbk7pv,So it goes.,5cc7fb
dbb6ozb,"Unfortunately when I saw it last night I was asking all of the same questions because quite simply, the movie did not make sense. 
In her opening monologue she is seen with her daughter speaking about how rough things are in the present state. To begin, this is the first time the movie tries to trick you into believing the daughter has already died. Second, in talking about how ugly this is, why would you choose to have this kid with the scientist when you know the genetics will lead to a rare condition resulting in death? I would not wish that on any child. 
My girlfriend saw the movie with me and tried to make sense of it, saying that altering the future could have a domino effect that could lead her to not have talked to the Chinese diplomat. There's a problem with this theory as well, she already obtained the information and used it to calm the Chinese Military and time IS linear.
I was also extremely upset with the music selection. It was downright annoying at most parts of the movie, and I have read that the movie has been disqualified from the Oscars because so much of it was copied from other movies.
It seems very unlikely that she is the only person on earth, apparently, that can see the future but oh thankfully she is chosen to speak to the aliens and, oh, what a coinky-dink, the aliens no she can see the future too!!!
The relationship with the scientist was extremely forced. After solving a global issue, I generally feel like the ""I know that I was supposed to meet you"" line did not work for me regarding their relationship. Then all the forwarded cut scenes leading to ""let's have a baby""... I don't buy it. 
Again, if she knew her actions would leave the child fatherless why not tell the scientist WAY in advance what she had been seeing and not drop that bombshell on him. Hell, I'd be running from that crazy bitch too.
The scientists conclusions from when our main character had fallen asleep and he figured out the 3D structure involved time seemed really ridiculous and scientifically speaking, I can't make any legitimacy of it.
Why the hell was the bird there? The damn thing was so go damn annoying. Others told me that they thought the bird could talk to the alien but when was a single time you saw the alien address the bird? The damn thing went ape shit. Talking of poor cinematography, it looked like they continued to use the same shot of the bird flying from one end of the cage to the other over and over!!! Seriously!?!?!
Finally, yes the idea of time travel is, as others are frequently mentioning, the key point the movie has emphasized... by accident. I don't have to reexplain how damn awful they messed up playing on linear time is, as many other redditors have clearly done so, but it was absolutely pathetic.

The development of Louise and her understanding of the alien language[ (and subsequently time)](#spoiler), her daughter and Ian was brilliant but the last 20 minutes ruined it in a most disappointing fashion.

One thing in particular (aside from the final spoon feeding) got me and please do correct me if I misunderstand this but the conversation with [General Shang in the future.....I get that she can now see time as nonlinear so can experience this 'future' at the same time as the present however she didn't know what to say, or even Chang's private number until he told her...in the future.  This is evident by the confused look on her face both in the 'future' and the present, so this 'future' is therefore only possible because of this very conversation.  There has to be some cause and effect but in this case the effect is directly caused by the effect which makes no sense.....This future could not exist without the events taking place there, in the future.](#spoiler) Please somebody correct me because I really would like this film to not be spoiled by the last 20 minutes!

Among others, a thing that bothers me is that the more you think about being that perceive time non-linear the more non-nonsensical the story gets from the aliens perspective. 
Why would such a race who can experience time all at once even need a language anymore? Communication between themselves would become irrelevant since you always already know what the other will do and say. The way they perceive time would also make the whole learning process in the first part of the movie completely irrelevant, the heptapods already know how the humans will react to everything, what the humans will show them etc. so they should already know how to communicate with the humans before coming to earth.

I understand that this movie could be refreshing to people who are bored by action-oriented science fiction films, and I'll be branded as a philistine for not being ""moved"" by the emotional scenes, but the pacing did a good job of defusing any real emotional pay off by showing the outcome without any real build up within the first five minutes. The twist ending where Amy Adams knows everything that will happen but proceeds anyway is so fundamentally irrational that it becomes unbelievable and raises numerous plot-breaking holes which would matter less if the plot had anything else to rely on. None of the characters' motivations were developed beyond the level at which they started the film, with the exception of Amy Adams who gains and wholly squanders the ability to predict the future. She doesn't take any steps to avoid the overwhelmingly negative outcome of her life after the events of the main plot. She doesn't seem to explain her newfound ability to Jeremy Renner, leading to their separation, even though given the circumstances he has no reason to doubt her. She also doesn't attempt to save her daughters life. Adams' emotional range in this film seems to start and end with this flat 1000-yard stare. Forest Whittaker's character doesn't learn anything. Jeremy Renner's character doesn't make any changes apart from the ones we knew he would based on the predictions within the film. Michael Stuhlbarg's character isn't developed. Why were low level military personnel allowed to acquire and plant such a quantity of explosives without anyone stopping them at any point and even asking what they were doing? Wouldn't the explosives need to be requisitioned? Are they just freely granted whenever anyone asks? Why were the aliens shown in a gas filled chamber from the mid-section down? Presumably as a cost-saving measure. Unfortunately, the film insisted on showing multiple close ups of the aliens mediocre CG.

d9wej12,"I give it a 6/10, primarily because of the ending and the nature of what's revealed.

This is indeed one of the most imaginative, tense, science-fiction movies I've seen this decade. The sound mixing and slowness of the camera really gives an incredible sense of weight and worry to the situations talking the aliens. They are very simple, but kept me glued to my seat watching everything fold out. Amy Adams is so great and I love her intelligence shining through as a character, but I have a huge problem with how it comes together.

The *Interstellar* comparisons are fair because it's has this sweeping scientific deus ex machina to make it all sweet and sappy to how it all came together. *Arrival* is more scientific and makes more sense it why everything happened, but I'm much more frustrated in how the plot was executed in one of the sloppiest ways possible. 

First off, already watching Hannah grow up and die serves as Louise's only form of backstory, so you ask ""When is the shoe going to drop?"" And when it does, the purpose is hand waved (mentioned as a disease because Adams now understands time) built as a way to emotionally pull and shock the audience. But we have so many flashbacks to the kid that give her a ""eureka"" moment, it just comes off as tedious and very uninspired. 

It's weakened by the fact that Amy Adams is really the only character. Renner is cheeky scientist guy, Whitaker is military guy, and Stuhlbarg is government liaison guy. It gives the movie so less meaning that it comes down to just calling a General Shang is this way to inter-connect the movie. And I don't feel anything for the tragedy about Ian and Hannah, because Louise and Ian barely have any chemistry other than comparing science and languages. If you built Ian as a real character and built up their romance as a real, budding thing without using those crappy flash-forwards hinting at what's to come, this would have been amazing.

Not too clear on whether the linguistics stuff holds up but it kind of doesn't matter, I think I wanted something more grounded like with The Martian because the time stuff felt like a cop out, also it was unclear how many daughters she had because they gave us the opening to Pixar's UP in the beginning, so she had one but then she memories from the future so it's a second but it could be that those memories from the beginning could be from the future.

**Me:** She can perceive the future because the language she's now able to understand! Wow, those were not flashbacks, but premonitions! Cool, I didn't see that coming. I don't know why they bothered with the father figure but I guess that's just believable. 

**Studio:** Are you sure you got it? I don't think you fully understand. Here's 20 more minutes of her with her daughter. Also, you know the only other lead in the movie? He's the dad. We did that so you would know it's the future, because she met him in the present, so for them to fuck and make a baby, it has to be the future. Get it? Great, we weren't sure that you understood it was the future yet, as if the General Shang scene wasn't already beating you over the head with a hammer. Also, you really need to understand Ian the father. That's why, on top of the 5 minutes of our aspiring to be a romance movie, we are going to have his character LITERALLY ASK ""Do you want to make a baby?"" Did you get all that? He's for SURE the dad, and this is for SURE the future. Got it? Great, thanks for coming, movie's over. 

Why even bother with that shitty romantic sub-plot? She can literally perceive all of time and experience the future. She has a child that dies of a mysterious terminal illness. She is one of the world's most talented linguistic academics. She made contact and learned the language of multi-dimensional beings by herself. But fuck all that, what we really need to do to make sure you understand that she is resiliant is to make her fuck the only guy in the movie and have him abandon her and his daughter. Because that's actually the hardest thing, and we totally can't just leave that out of the movie.

Louise is the chosen one and is given the heptapods language and therefore, the ""gift of time."" The aim and purpose of the Arrival is for the Hepatpods to impart their nonlinear perception of time to all of mankind. She now understands their language which includes the ability to see time as no one else can, and I believe that she will teach it to the human race so that further down the line we can somehow save the octopus people/ourselves/whoever needs saving. She has the gift to see time as non linear. The purpose of the Arrival of the Heptapods is to pass on this info to humankind through Louise. That's Louise's purpose, to pass on this info to all humankind. Right??? I think so, and it's confirmed by a few things:

1) She is able to pass on this knowledge cause she teaches the Chinese general to speak to wife etc so he can say to Louis etc etc no war without widow... whatever! He is taught about the heptapods language so he has his part in saving everyone when he's about to nuke the heck out of the heptapods. This is the paradox of Arrival, and arguably the most complex and mentally taxing part of the whole thing. When Louise hijacks the military‚Äôs phone and contacts General Shang (Tzi Ma), she transcends the present to access future knowledge of a past event. In talking the Chinese leader down, she repeats the final words of Shang‚Äôs dying wife: ‚ÄúWar does not make winners, only widows.‚Äù How did she gain such intimate knowledge? General Shang himself, having benefited from Louise‚Äôs warning, had to travel to the relative future himself and impart his wife‚Äôs powerful words so the American linguist could use them to persuade him on the phone. He was taught!

2) The flash-fowards implies that she teaches humankind the language. There's flash-forwards of her teaching the language at her university. She releases a book about it! This means she can teach everyone about the octopus people's perception of time, I think.

So here's the debate: either she can teach us all or she can't. If she can't, then how are the heptapods saved? Is the answer that we evolve over 3000 years through Louise's book to find out about nonlinear time? This opens up loads of questions. Are we meant to assume that because of the ""Arrival"" we evolve to know about non linear time over 3000 years? Massive assumption! Why does it take 1 person (Louise) to know about nonlinear time for this new evolution to take place? Wouldn't it have happened anyway? 

If she can teach the language, then why doesn't she give it to Ian, who's perfectly smart enough to understand it like her. Why isn't Ian taught? He's a keen bean, he's just as fascinated as she it. There's a whole new debate that comes out of this: would Ian want to learn about it or not? Would Ian want to know about his death or not? I'm assuming he does, because there's no indication in the film that he wouldn't. If he is taught, surely Ian knows his daughter will die, like Louise does. His reaction when told that his daughter will die (shown in a flashback during a conversation between the daughter and Louise) is that he's understandably pissed. He'd stop the birth if he's clued up on the whole time-linear-stuff like the plot implies he should be. 

Is she the only one who can time understand time? If this is the case, does she need to stay alive for 3000 bloody years to save the octopus people??

This bit does not make sense. Either Ian should know about the birth and death of his daughter stop it or Louise is now a bloody god who survives for ages, which opens up another can of WTFs.

 Theres a few scenes after she experienced the bombing where her  'higher ups' felt she wasnt coherent after her 'concussion.' This was her own brain trying to make sense of reality.

the locations of the ships all seemed to me to be positioned in countries with both historical and modern warring/aggression tendencies.

The heptapods knew what would happen, that we would raise arms against them, and due to our selfishness, would not want to share what we each had learned, and likely knew we would go silent towards each other. 

The film to me being about communication, they positioned their ships perfectly, forcing us to have to reach out to one another, to those we have been at war with or hostile towards, in order to save us all. Forcing us to become more helpful, be more open and trust one another.

So why did it happen at the beginning too? Leads me to other theories.

One is as follows...did she in fact live this life with her child, and as she came into contact with the aliens and her thoughts became 'scrambled' (seeing the alien in the room, begin dreaming in their language, etc.) forget who her child was, only to have her 'memories' become the ability to see the future?

da11ia5,"First time Reddit commenter. This movie was amazing. I, like seemingly most, had my mind tossed around like a pinball in a pinball machine at Chukie Cheeses. But there were a few topics that I thought of that I haven't seen addressed, so I hope that I can get some feedback from others. 

1) Why is Ian seemingly so willing to leave Louise and his daughter? Why was he so angry? I would imagine that, given the unfolding of the ""arrival"" events, Ian would have the utmost confidence in Louise's decisions. The future that she saw ultimately saved the world - how could he not see the importance of fulfilling that destiny? How could he not empathize with the decision that Louise had to make? And upon finding out that his daughter was terminal, he chose to leave? Instead of stay with her? I'm not a father, but this seems biologically unreasonable. I tried to reflect and identify points where his leaving was necessary or galvanizing, but could not. Perhaps I'm missing something. 

2) did anyone else catch the parallel with the 12 ships and the 12 decibles as told in the Bible? I find it interesting that the aliens came with a message of a ""second coming"". An interesting point to contemplate is that return in 3000 years. Humans will have had to successfully convey through generations the importance of the message and teachings of the aliens, as well as the obligation humanity has to the aliens upon their return. This, to me, is a very similar task presented by religion, and the texts that are passed down to hopefully convey the significance of past events, and possibly fortell of future ones. But this information, as passed, cannot be gaurenteed to reach the ears of future generations. It relies on faith. I am not religious but I found these parallels deeply intriguing. 

Edit: even if humans are successful in learning the new language and seeing time as non-linear, these knowledge loops (as defined by a human life span) fall well short of reaching the minds of people 3000 years in the future. We would still rely on the faith of future generations. 

3) this is more obvious, but there were also many parallels to the state of our current society. We see continued efforts toward separation and isolationism (brexit, trump). We see a faltering ability to effectively communicate. Our realities and opinions are concocted and coerced by the media. Our knee jerk reaction is to fight. We choose aggression and hostility in order to combat our conceived fears, whether real or not. 

Edit: 4) Can de ja vu be attributed to a temporary lapse in our linear perception of reality? 

Edit: 5) Psychics have claimed to lucidly dream of the future. It's even a fairly common phenomenon to be reported by average people, on some level or another. I myself have intensely lucid dreams - so intense and detailed that they effect my reality and my perception of past and future events. Is our sleeping mind able to break the linear perception of time? Is it possible that we are able to dream in a different, unknown, and possibly universal language and are simply unaware?

I really hope to bounce these ideas off of some other brains out there ...

I have 2 questions. Why show her daughter at the very beginning of the movie before we even know whats going on at all? It seemed like the whole daughter thing happened before the present movie time all the way up until the ""twist"" at the end when we find out that those ""flashbacks"" were actually visions of the future, yet Amy's character behaved, as I said earlier almost all the way up until the twist, like those flashbacks really happened and I havent noticed any early indication that it was just her dreaming. But then again how could she have visions of the future right at the beginning of the movie when she only started learning the alien language in the middle of the movie? 

~~2nd question is, if you know in advance that your daughter will get cancer, would it be possible to be prepared for it? As in, detect it and start treatment so early that the chance of recovery would be nearly 100%?

d9vj5j5,"Ok first of all I thought it was a good movie and very interesting, but I have a few questions...

-So essentially every flashback was actually a flash forward  
and the Movie is presented to us in a linear fashion minus those flash forwards and possible dream sequences. Movie starts with a Flash forward to kinda trick the audience into thinking it's a flashback . At the beginning she doesn't know anything about the aliens or the language, so why do we get those flash forwards. Is it because when she acquired the language from the aliens all versions of herself past and future acquire the ability to see time as fluid? Telepathy from the aliens? Or is the whole movie a flashback or something recounting the events? I don't know... kinda tricky or dare I say deceitful?

-All the flashforwards played out as memories where conversation seemed to not have louise's agency in it except for the conversation with General Shang at the ball. At that point it seemed like her present self inhabitated her future self. But the event already happened so why did it look like that? So that means she can travel to any point in time and not hold the current knowledge of that self? Also I thought that moment played out awkwardly since I don't see how someone would pull out their phone and be like my ""private number right here"". "" Oh you don't remember what you said to me? Well let me whisper it in your ear"" 

- So basically you can tell the future. Or whatever see time as fluid. I don't know if that would bring peace... I would definitely be careful of who I share that with.

These little things low key ruined some of the movie for me. But to be honest what they were aiming for is something really hard to depict on screen. Or maybe I'm missing stuff. Will watch again and see how I feel.

Also, if time isn't linear for them and they can thus experience the future, did they know exactly what would happen and in what order it would happen once they landed on Earth? Isn't being able to see the future kind of like being omniscient? Couldn't they have solved their problems simply by peering into the future to find the solution?

Zero-sum: that for every winner there is a loser; for every gain there is a loss.
Question two: Dr. Bank‚Äôs daughter,the 12 yr old Hannah asks her mother about the breakout between  her mother Adams & father Renner , Amyy Adams Dr. Banks says ""Dad (Renner) thought I made a bad decision.""
To get married? Learn the language? Bring about the child and bare her sorrowful passing?

",5cc7fb
d9xd0a5,Anybody know the music that played in the first and last scenes with Louise and her daughter? It sounded really familiar,5cc7fb
d9xdmlu,"SPOILERS: this is how I see the ending
At the moment when Louise starts to understand the gift (language), she can perceive the past, present and future at once (she has memories of past and of future at the same time). The purpose of that gift is to prevent the end of mankind in the next 3000 years - so someone who can perceive time in the non-linear way, is able to influence the future. This is what we can see in the movie. Louise at the same time speaks with former chinese general at gala (now prime minister I think) and calls him in our present time. For normal people who perceive time in linear way, there is a paradox, a time loop = 18 months. But for Louise it is not loop (or paradox) because for her is everything happening at the same time. 

In her memories of future she knows that the world will be saved - she meets the general and he tells her what she did (from his perspective 18 months ago, from perspective of Louise - right now). Maybe that is why is Louise surprised in the movie, it is for the first time she knows what to do, how to save the world. This is the first use of her new ""ability"".

The second use is related to her daughter. She knows that her daughter is going to die and her husband Jeremy Renner is going to leave her. We know that she is able to change the future and prevent that to happen (that is very very important).

In these two examples which we can see in the movie she decides to maintain what she remembers from the future. In the first case is Louise saving the whole mankind, and she is acting for the purpose of the greater good (her personal feeling are not important). In the second case we focus at her personal life, in which she ""remember"" that her daughter is going to die. She knows the pain and joy, even though it still did not happen yet (from the perspective of normal people - for her it is happening right now).

For the ending is much more important to understand why she chose to have a daughter which is going to die with the husband which is going to leave her. 

At first we have to understand to the concept of CHOICE and FREE WILL. Obviously there has to be some space for choices, because that is the main purpose of that gift - change the future to prevent the destruction of mankind.

But what about the DETERMINISM? For Louise the future is determined, she can see what is going to happen and this implies that the future is given.

At this point we have to describe the mechanism that involves POSSIBILITY OF CHOICE and DETERMINED FUTURE together. IMO Louise is always able to choose (call to chinese general or to not call, ""later"" hug and mary Jeremy Renner or not, have a baby or not, etc.), but something else has to be determined, and that is the future which she is always able to see (or in other words - remember). 

The solution of military crisis is clear (how did it happen). She knows that the crisis does not end in the war, and she knows that the call will cause the end of this crisis. She also knows that having the baby with Jeremy Renner will give her a lot of joy, but a lot of pain. She knows that her baby is going to die, but she already experienced those feelings, and she does not want to let her go without spending a real time with her (hold her a see her with her own eyes). When I realized this, the end became really heartbreaking and tearful. 

Understanding to that language is for Louise something like curse and torture for the rest of her life. She knows when she is going to die and maybe she knows that she will never have another baby. Because she made a choice which determined her future. 

What is the ending of the movie telling us? All nations around the world should work together to prevent its own destruction, this is obvious. But the main character is Louise, not the mankind. The end shows us, that ending are more likely bittersweet instead of happy or unhappy, there is always some joy and pain (if the experience with her daughter would be only about pain, I am sure she would change the future). She hoped or knew that the joy will outweight the pain resulting from the loss of the loved baby and loved husband (something like balance of payments). But in the end, IMO, she perceives that the pain is much higher than the joy - and still, she does not regret of this life. 

Now is everything the memory of the past, she can not change that anymore and I think she would not if she could have. I do not think that we should ask ourselves, what would she do ""if"" - she didnt call to chinese general, she didnt hug Jeremy Renner or she didnt have her daughter Hannah. Louise made a choice with knowing what is going to happen. Because simply - we do not know. 

Interstellar for me is about hope, about hope that someone will keep his promise - that the dad will come back one day - as he promised. When Cooper fell in the teseract I thought that he will be ghost for Murph forever, that he will never get out of there and he will be stuck at this point in time forever. I thought that he could not keep the promise and only will ""hug"" Murph through the fifth dimension. But then the final meeting was stronger then I expected, with very simple words Nolan did a lot. 

Arrival is IMO more depressive and less scientific in the ending. But more about personal feelings and about the pain, I still makes me think what I would do if I know the future. After Interstellar I read many books about physics, and I tried to find out how is possible this or that. After Arrival, I am more interested in philosophy and what would I do if I know, that my daughter will die some day in the future. ",5cc7fb

The UK Guardian (4*, film of the week) referenced Shyamalan. I didn't get his Sixth Sense twist right til the end, and I didn't get Arrival's future/past twist til my wife explained it! I didn't understand how Louise told the Chinese general about his wife's dying words til I read it here! I didnt get that the aliens gave her the ability to see the future. I agree with some commenters here that it's not clear how language connects to time; and that with the aliens able to 'puff' travel, inplying mastery of time, space and possibly the multiverse, it doesnt make sense that they'd need our help; or that the world unity which apparently was the key tous helping them in 3,000 years, would be expected to last 30 years, never mind 3,000.",5cc7fb

d9zsco4,"This movie had so many things that will make it extremely memorable and perhaps one of my favorite movies.

- A powerful message that stays with you after the final scene. This movie has provoked so much thought and discussion in my mind. I went in thinking I would see a movie about aliens and instead got a thoughtful movie about humanity.

- Beautiful cinematography. I absolutely love the opening shot (that came back at the end) of the textured ceiling, slowly panning down to the windows overlooking the water.

- Moving music. It really ties all of the above together into a cohesive, emotional experience.

- A twist that actually surprised me.

- A closing scene that had everything to me: A memorable quote (although I can't remember it word for word). ""If you could see your future, would you change a thing?"" Great acting, great camera work, all tied together with a moving musical piece (""On The Nature Of Daylight"" by Max Richter).",5cc7fb
d9zsfjg,"One thing I noticed after my third viewing: In the very, very first opening shot of the film as the camera pans down Louises living room at her house and she says ""I used to think this is where your story began""....

... there are two half-empty wine glasses and a bottle of wine on the table.

Now we know Louise lived alone during the events of the film. So I think the most likely scenario is that the opening shot of the film comes immediately after (chronologically) the line ""Do you want to make a baby?"" in the living room - which is spoken in the very final scene in the living room. Makes sense - they were having drinks, chat discussion etc - then decided to go make that baby and went to the bedroom. leaving their half empty glasses behind.


So you can say: The movie quite literally begins with its ending. And the opening scene takes place immediately after the ending scene, chronologically.

Also of note: The voiceover to the opening scene 'I used to think this is where your story began' I interpreted as literally referring to Hannahs conception. Life begins with conception. And this is backed up by the above, because they had literally just in the prior scene (chronologically - though placed at the end of the movie) decided to make the baby.",5cc7fb

da10y0b,"Ok here's my little theory to answer the question: What do the aliens need humans help for in 3000 years? 

Personally I think the aliens simply can't look past 3000 years in the future. Like there's a darkness that suddenly envelops their minds at that point. Like a psychic who can't see tomorrow because she dies tonight. 

And that scares them. Human, however,  are able to predict the future with science, modelling, algorithms etc and technology.

The aliens need humanity to  help them figure out what actually happens in 3000 years, because even they themselves don't know what it is. They see something coming, they know it's coming....  And then darkness / nothing.  But that's all they know. It's our powers of prediction, thinking linearly, that will be needed. Maybe we can stop it? Or warn them? Etc

The movie never said in 3000 years is when humans and aliens will work together or return. For all we know, it could be 500 years later, with the endgame being able to figure out / stop whatever they can't see happening 3000 years after the film.

Later it is seen again with an Alien marking on the title page and also being addressed to Hannah in a flash forward. This tells me the book was written after the arrival, presumably the book is about her account of the arrival and linguistics. She could have not put the Alien marking in the book before the arrival without learning the language/thought process. Is it the same book or was another book written? Why was this book shown before and after in a flash forward? I did not see if the covers or titles were different or if they were shown. Did I miss something?

2)If everything is happening simultaneously past, present and future in our linear view of things, then does that mean anyone who learns the language is forever in a loop.. eg, waking up on Monday /Tuesday/Wedesday etc etc simultaneously.. experiencing the day they learned the language and the day the die, and in between over and over again?

Similar to answers others have given here, namely, the interaction only doesnt make sense if you think of time as a human does.

If understanding the language means seeing the future, wouldn't Ian have come to the same conclusion that Louise did about their child? Or, he left because he had to, because that's what happened in the future? 

I like the storyline better if only Louise can see into the future, more so than a storyline where all of humanity (that can learn the language) can. 

Can't wait to see it again.

my initial thought is NO. Once you learn the language,I believe your consciousness lives your entire life in the same instance. You cannot change the future because it has already happened. the whole point was that time isn't linear. Things in the future can affect the past (the phone call) but you cannot change future.

When Louise uses her prescient mind to look to the 'memory' of her meeting General Shiang at the banquet while she presently is on the phone with him, she is surprised at what he has to say of her and the audience gets the impression that she is genuinely surprised at their encounter.

Sholdn't she already know what will happen and don't be confused? From the other hand general showed her his cell number like he was meant to do this. Maybe she said something to him during the phone call?

1)If Louise received the ability to perceive time in a non linear fashion due to learning the hectapods language, why did we see flashforwards at the start of the movie before she ever came into contact with them? Was this just for the viewers?

2)If everything is happening simultaneously past, present and future in our linear view of things, then does that mean anyone who learns the language is forever in a loop.. eg, waking up on Monday /Tuesday/Wedesday etc etc simultaneously.. experiencing the day they learned the language and the day the die, and in between over and over again?


I also assumed the gift the hectapods gave humanity was advancement in science and technology, hence humans helping them in 3000 years.. it just seemed that Louise already knew the language so she could have basically taught everyone and gifted them as opposed to the language being the gift and different parts being located in different parts of the world.",5cc7fb

But then it turns out that all they needed was Louise b/c she has the gift?  Was it hinting at that at some point in the next 3000 years, the 12 pieces needed to be peacefully assembled?  I don't remember that wall of text being referenced for the rest of the movie.  What am I missing?",5cc7fb

I was a little confused by this because if the heptapods experience time as a flat circle (sorry, had to) then why would they not be able to long anticipate the danger and correct accordingly. What possible need could such a species have of a lower life form in such a case? 
My theory is that there may be some sort of abrupt end to time that the heptapods cannot get experience beyond and therefore they are making first contact in order to take care of all the formalities of introduction to a new species. It seems to me that the heptapods believe they may need an ally in the future and they are kicking off that process.

dac2n7h,"My thoughts before I read anyone else's 

Overall wonderful film,  I saw Fantastic Beasts the day before and absolutely loathed it,  I would give Arrival a strong eight out of ten.

Amy Adams was utterly compelling, she really has been wasted in the Superman films and here she really stole the movie, which is generally good for a character with her screen time to do.

I loved the reveal that she didn't know who the girl was in the visions instead of them being flashbacks, executed very well.

I loved the subtitles when she was flown up and actually seeing from their POV, very cool.

That ending sequence with he General gave me chills, reminded me of Inception somehow and I loved the jumping backwards and forwards from the present to the future, further showing not just telling us how time had become non-linear.

Some final points.  I didn't really buy the relationship with Renner, you kind of knew they would become a couple when they first met on the flight over, just because that's what happens in movies.  But I never really felt a real spark or connection between the two.  I can't say it was their fault, the script really didn't give them a chance to.  Sure, they had their moments together but again, I didn't really feel any sexual undertones (?) beneath it all.  It was so heavy handed seeing the father in the distance, in a film that got almost everything right that I almost thought they were going for the fakeout and it wouldn't actually be Renner, but of course it was.

And finally that moment where she said she wasn't dreaming about them and it jumped to one of the heptapods in the room with her was very cool, but I felt it didn't make a tonne of sense.  If she was having visions then Jeremy almost certainly was having them as well.  I mean shit he even asked her about it, so I thought he must have been experiencing it as well, but it was never followed up or mentioned again.  Maybe I missed something there.

What did the heptapods achieve, what is humanity supposed to do now?  They need our help in three thousand years, but for what exactly?  Maybe it's not super relevant to the emotions of the story but I was left wondering what the end game was and what the aliens had actually done

One last thing, I got in a little late and just caught the end of the conversation between Forest and Amy in her office, did I miss anything of any real significance?  Cheers

Some remove their ring after a suicide, however the father was not there at the child's death, so I assumed indirectly that the father died. However, this along with her emotionally reacting to her ""memories"" were my first clues that we were dealing with a future insight situation.

The aliens speaking in literal circles---no beginning, no end---sealed the nonlinear time business. Oddly enough, I was just discussing Deep Space 9 with a friend . . . which if you've seen the series, then you know why I mention it.

Loved the movie. Except where they bashed on the physicist for discussing math. Arithmetic is one of the best ways to establish communication as it is relatively concrete and contains a lot of grammatical information---syntax, conjunction, comparison, sequence, causality, identity, affirmation, negation . . .

Add it turns out, the aliens had a view of time that allowed for mystical shenanigans, so algebra wasn't an effective kind of communication . . . which didn't really do it for me, but that's just a personal issue and not a real criticism. The plot device was worth the delivery non-linear.",5cc7fb

I immediately thought, ""There's no way a teacher would be able to afford a house like that."" Ive been a teacher before. They are way underpaid.

By using information from the future.

dbxp7hb,"What if, in true Lovecraft fashion, Louise isn't actually perceiving the future, but is slowly becoming insane?

All of the scenes related to her future husband, and featuring her daughter, don't necessarily need to have happened. The entire plot remains intact without these scenes ever occurring or ever representing a reality. They may just be visions that Louise has imagined following her interactions with the alien race. She may go on to lead a similar life in the future to what she has envisioned, but that can be due to her visions becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy (influencing the way in which she interacts with the man who she believes will become her future husband, etc.).

The main counter to this theory is the event when Louise gains access to the Chinese military generals' phone number and tells him his wifes' dying words. Is it possible that she gained access to this information through some other way, and then proceeded to envision the general himself giving her the information? There was a large communications room located within the military base and some of the personnel clearly had communication access with China. What if the wifes' dying words were very generic, and Louise simply stated a generic deathbed quote?

I want this theory to be true because the movie implies that language influences our reality, when at best it can only modify our perception of reality. Reality exists independently of how we perceive it, despite what the events in the movie suggest.

The main 'plot' is a linguist 'cracking' the language of aliens who don't know algebra (!?)... OK, I've read sci-fi with more outlandish aliens. So how does the movie show this? With a jarring 3min voice-over exposition in the middle of the movie! No excitement of discovery, just an inept voiced montage.

I have other personal critiques like everyone else: learning a new language let's you retroactively time travel? Chinese general also time travels? Up until his cheesy line, the 'future husband' could have been anyone, was there any lead up to his character loving the only linguist who knows sandskrit?

But the cop-out of the main feature (communicating with aliens) is just lazy and terrible. If I make a super hero movie, I would not voice over ""and then he beat the bad guy in a awesome fight"" then have the rest of the movie just be talking.

I guess I was just misled by the tagline ""When twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world, linguistics professor Louise Banks is tasked with interpreting the language of the apparent alien visitors."" (IMDB). I more accurate tagline would be something like ""Linguistics professor Louise Banks struggles to find herself and the meaning of her life when she faces an existential crisis during her role in first contact."" Something, anything, to emphasize that this is not a sci-fi movie, but a human interest movie within a ""sci-fi"" universe.

d9wjvkp,"Arrival (film) My theory, the reason for the alien visit. All comments welcome, first time posting on here. :) Please forgive my clumsy Reddiquette.

The true 'weapon' was not the heptapods' language, it was Louise's child - Hannah. The Heptapods' true purpose was to 'gift' 12 women with 1 child each - (from the twelve pods positioned around earth). These 12 children would grow up to form a ""world team"" of gifted scientists and invent time travel for humankind and in turn help the Heptapods. As Hannah dies in childhood, the Heptapods, and mankind, are doomed. 

There are *possible* clues to this:

1. Louise tells Hannah in a flash forward that she is ""so fast at Piano, Poetry etc"". This is due to her high academic aptitude and future leanings towards greatness.
2. Louise describes the weapon to Ian using the Heptapods' phrases such as ""work together as a whole"" and ""it's a much bigger picture"". Without Louise knowing it, this alludes to the 12 global children working together in the future.
3. The Heptapods tell Louise ""The weapon OPENS time."" Literally, Hannah will open a portal for time travel.
4. When Louise is decoding the first string of Heptapod symbols (from alien language) on the computer the words ""host"", ""man"", ""woman"", ""technology"" are present. This signifies the importance of Louise as the host, Ian as the father, and the future technology Hannah will invent.
4. As a side-effect, the language gave Louise visions of the future. In the future, Louise teaches the world the Heptapod dialect, and so all human beings can then ""see"" the future - but humans cannot time travel until Hannah invents it.
5. When Louise goes with Ian into the pod she asks the aliens to ""Give Louise weapon now."" The Heptapod then taps on the glass pointing to Louise as if to imply ""you are part of the weapon"". The Heptapods need to urgently 'give' Louise a child as they sense the bomb counting down behind her.
6. Louise then approaches the Heptapods, and places her hands against the glass. Next is the impregnation of Louise through the glass - we see her close her eyes and 'react' to it physically. From this moment on, she is pregnant with future Hannah. 
7. This is why the Heptapods then save Louise by pushing her away with a force field, and why she and Ian are spared from the blast - Louise needs to survive to give birth to Hannah and Ian needs to help raise his daughter with a love for science.
8. Heptapods told Louise they would need humanity's help in 3000 years time. This is due to the fact that Heptapods are unable to time travel in 3000 years time and need humans to time travel to their planet to save them. 
9. The Heptapods leave earth in a hurry, only having impregnated 1 of the 12 originally planned female 'incubators'. After the aliens leave, Ian asks Louise if she would like to ""make a baby"" - she puts on a happy face and says yes, but we see her hugging him and looking sombre - as she knows the fate of future Hannah. Rather poignantly, in that moment, Louise and Ian don't realize that she is/was already pregnant. 
10. General Shang tells Louise at the celebration gala of her book ""Eighteen months ago you called me"" - this means at the time of the gala Hannah is 9 months old, at home with Ian - and why Ian is not shown at the gala with Louise.
11. Hannah, the only hope for the Heptapods, dies young. We see Louise describe to Hannah ""a very rare disease that's unstoppable"" (many child cancers are rare and not treatable). Tragically, Louise and Ian will never realize that Hannah was the true weapon, and not the alien language.
12. Hannah, conversely, was gifted with seeing into the past - hence her drawings of her parents in the hazmat suits with the bird in the cage, the way she seems to be drawn to the lake pebbles that look like the pods??
13. Most ironically: In the ultimate gesture of goodwill, when Louise takes off her suit the very first time to approach the Heptapods, she is exposed to what will ultimately leave her child genetically susceptible to disease. This is further exacerbated when Louise, already pregnant, climbs into the mini pod and breathes in the atmosphere of the Heptapods, without a hazmat suit.

In closing: With the current sate of the world we live in - with 2 thirds of invertebrates set to be extinct by the year 2020, with global warming sending us towards the brink of no turning back, with more and more countries' inhabitants becoming divided and not united, let's hope some other species out there is listening. And lastly, to quote Tobias Stone: ""A little thing leads to an unstoppable destruction that could have been prevented if you‚Äôd listened and thought a bit. [But] ‚Ä¶ That is the way of the human‚Ä¶ We need to find a way to bridge from our closed groups to other closed groups, try to cross the ever widening social divides.""

**First**, my cinema completely ruined it for me: the screen was very dark, especially its sides. Sometimes I tried really hard to understand what was going on and it was very, very distracting. I know Villeneuve's movie picture is quite tasty and classy, but I was not able to enjoy it this time.

**Second**, I couldn't chase away the feeling that the movie was a bit of *secondhand* in some parts. The very first thing that we hear, even before we see anything, is ""On The Nature Of Daylight"" by Max Richter. It's a beautiful piece of music, but in my mind it's totally connected with Nolan's ""Inception"", so I instantly had this ""conflict of movies"" in my mind. Moreover, ""Arrival"" reminded me about ""Inception"" sometimes, especially with those flashback scenes.

**Third**, the whole ""flashback/flashforward"" thing and the main plot twist felt a lot like ""Interstellar"". I just couldn't help but comparing these two.

**Next**, I didn't quite understand why they didn't show much about Ian's work. He is a physicist, yet we mainly see him decyphering the alien's language. Felt quite weird. 

**Next**, in the very beginning Forest Whitaker asks Amy Adams to translate an audio file to a **fucking alien's language**. Like, are you crazy? Do they study it somewhere in the universities, or maybe I missed something?

It was a minor eye-rolling moment for me and I chalked it up to Hollywood not writing its characters like they were real people.

My point is that I think movies like these fail when the design of the alien doesn't suggest or confirm their ability to function in the way the movie wants them to.

I suffer from depression from a very young age. And I would not want my child to go through that. It would be very egoistical for me to make the decision that she makes.

I see these types of points about heptapod algebra raised frequently and I disagree. The aliens are non-linear in time, true. But algebra is not linear in time.

The equals sign makes a truth statement about all the algebra. A truth like (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = a^2 + 4ab + b^2 - 2ab  does not depend on time. Its always true, and has many other things equal to  (a+b)^2.

 Its only our perception in that we like to reason things out in sequential order that leads us to write it that way.

After thinking about it because it bothered me, I realized she made an incredibly selfish fucked up decision there. 1) in a flash forward she reveals that Jeremy renner leaves eventually because she tells him the daughter is going to die from a disease. 2) knowing full well that the death will occur, and that she WONT TELL JEREMY RENNER ABOUT IT UNTIL YEARS AFTER SHE'S BORN. she pursues that anyway. 
The husband never had any say. He's only mentioned in passing in the flash forwards. The greatest joys in her visions weren't even of their relationship with the daughter, only hers. It almost feels like he was just used to satisfy her desires to fulfill those visions. Am I missing something? Because that seems incredibly manipulative and selfish to me. I think it's a powerful idea either way, just messed up. 

also they could've cut Renner's last two lines. The corny ""looking for you"" line was so weird.

Ultimately, even if you can watch your life from the end instead of from just the present and make decisions based on that, I would think as long as the decisions are based on emotional truth and love, they can still be good choices even if pain and suffering comes down the line, both for yourself and for the ones around you. I assume there are exceptions to this, but avoiding death and pain is overrated, especially if you are not surprised by it but can face it prepared. I think we can all relate to this.

d9y8z6m,"Really interesting, though I'm kinda confused by how the future events are not capable of being altered. When Louise finds out that she calls the Chinese general, she rushes to call him in the present which seems to indicate that if she had not, the General would have instigated war. Unless, because Louise is not aware that she cannot alter her future, she still calls the general. But if that's the case, the whole situation should be paradoxical to her making her question her actions (in other words, she would not have seen the future if she had not called the general, and if she was unable to make a call, would the future be changed?) I guess that can be more or less explained by determinism and the phone call is just an expression of Louise's free will despite the fact that it was going to happen regardless of her present actions (though I still feel like the whole thing would confuse the hell out of her).

Also, do you think Ian had non-linear perception as well meaning he was also aware of his future daughter's death and his eventual divorce? He seemed rather forward  when he approached Louise at the end, which contrasts their rather professional, non-romantic relationship that they had had leading up to that point.

dad1uj5,"my inner nerd side was raging that the human side of the story was taking up for space than the aliens themselves, but at the same time the story was so well written that it ended up being extremely gripping. Well done on the director, the aliens from beginning till end stayed mysterious (especially when they disappear in smoke, it's even more incredible because we never saw them land in the first place), and the main character was soooooo legit. Her ""losing her mind"" because of skipping through time was very believable but still vague enough that it surprised me when the plot twists occurred.

My only real issue was that the daughter character was pretty boring, and the interactions between her and Louise felt lackluster. I don't know, I feel like if their relationship was more detailed and better acted (please daughter... you seem like you're from some crummy Disney sitcom) it would've made the parts with her daughter more gripping, and would've made the movie a bit more solid as a whole.

I think the lesson the movie is trying to give us with the whole ""would you make the same choices if you'd knew how it'd end"" concept is that you can't really control the way you want things to go and that, in the end, the only real choice you have is to accept these terrible moments when they ""arrive."" I think the movie is also telling us that not being able to accept the harsh reality is what leads people to make regrettable decisions later. Jeremy Renner's character ends up divorcing Amy Adams' character because she knows of his baby's imminent terminal illness. But Amy Adams makes what ends up being a less regrettable choice by still having the baby even though she knows the baby will too die, believing that it's better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.

d9xhub3,"I don't think so. I don't like the idea that people think death is part of  a non-linear experience. When the mind dies, there is nothing to process time non-linearly.

d9x0ge8,"You might be reading a little too much into it, and the movie didn't really extrapolate too much on how the heptapod experience of time lined up with their linear existence.  Costello might be able to tell his past self to tell Abbott things while he was still alive, similar to how Louise did, but how close that would be to the actual experience of interacting with someone who shares your temporal location with is really anyone's guess.  would interacting with the memories of a person have the same meaningful social connections as interacting with their actual self?  

I merely thought the phrase ""Abbott is death process"" just meant that he died, and I think i prefer that interpretation to some esoteric concept of existential death.  It made the moment poignant and sad, which it otherwise wouldn't have been if the heptapods didn't share a similar sense of loss that we do.  ",5cc7fb

I was thinking more along the lines of their experience of time (nonlinearly) allows them not to live the future, in the sense of being able to change what is happening in that exact (future) moment, but just to be able to see it. (Though perhaps being able to see the future constitutes their ability to change it by acting in the present. Or perhaps our futures are simply predetermined which, given the context of the film makes more sense to me- though its not obvious which is correct) So in the same manner one would not be able to go back in the past and live in that moment freely, but would be able to view it like a film.

They would feel the same way about death as you would about standing on a planet outside of your space-time horizon.",5cc7fb
d9vcfn1,My understanding of her actions is that she was willing to go through the pain due to all the beauty and love that would also come along with it. Since she has begun to experience time non-linearly you'd assume that the pain would also be mixed in with all the love and happiness.,5cc7fb
d9wgos5,"I think the characters are living in a predetermined universe with only one set of possible events and nothing but the illusion of choice. That way the future can technically be knowable given the present position and velocity of all things. The aliens may observe it like a painting and zoom in on specific parts to perform specific actions. 

They might even live outside of our dimensions given how they disappear the way your finger would seem to disappear if you withdrew it from a 2d world that exists on the surface of a liquid. I think Lovecraft's creatures are also full of noodly appendages while being extra dimensional.

If I'm wrong then our protagonist has a choice of having her daughter or not. If she tells her husband what she knows, he may not have a kid with her, her kid won't give her future memories that help her learn the universal language, and everything unravels since how is she even doing this exercise in the first place. That's why I think in this story, the timeline is singular and fixed. If you unfix it the paradoxes compound and you're left with more unanswerable questions.

As to what the aliens need help with, that's certainly a fun writing prompt, but I think there are some potential hints in the movie. Firstly, 3000 years may not be long for them. They may be experiencing their problem at the same time they're fixing it by visiting earth. That's not a hint, but just something to keep in mind while pondering, given how unconventional everything else about them is. Next, the only weakness alluded to is that they may not be good with simple math and abstract numbers. They've got a firm grip on forces of nature and matter, but it seems to be an organic control given the design of their ships which have no apparent wiring or peripheral requirements. 

So 2 things humanity might be able to offer could be: 

1. Science as well as abstract calculation.

2. Something coming from our linear perspective of time. They always know the future, so they have no practice predicting the future. We have mathematical algorithms and simulations to predict to high degrees of accuracy things that will happen. What if there is an event that wipes out all heptapods simultaneously 3000 years or more from now? They may not be able to see their own future past that point since none have future memories. Alternatively maybe there's a giant cosmic disturbance that muddies the painting and they simply can't see what's coming, even if maybe they will survive.

Humans could help predict/prevent such an event, or by teaching humans to see the future, humans might be outside the range of the disturbance/disaster and be able to see the future that the aliens can't, and together they can go from there.

Maybe the aliens know they will die and it can't be avoided. Maybe humans ""help"" them simply by remembering them, carrying on the language and their legacy.

Or it could be even simpler. Humans have weapons necessary to fight off an incoming invasion from a third species. Heptapods give humans communication skills, later on humans fight a war or supply resources as allies.

The sign of a good story, for me, is that it gets me turning my imagination like this for fun afterwards.

Essentially, the value of life with the perception of all time at once comes not from making ""choices"" but rather it is acting upon what will happen that imbues it with meaning.

it's similar to Man of Steel for me. The reason I can't get into superman stuff is because the idea is always in the back of my head that any confrontations between kryptonians and humans would be over in a millisecond. The writers have to make it so they're more ""equal"" though in order for their stories to work. So you have shit like the ongoing fight between a kryptonian commander or something:

Let me preface by saying that I read higher up in the thread that in the short story, Hannah dies in an accident, which I feel would have been horrible, given the mother's ability to see the future. I think incurable disease is a better solution, by far. 

As for the scene, they could have added a moment where mother and daughter are hugging or the daughter whispers something to the mother in her death bed. We, the audience don't need to hear it. In the context of the scene in the beginning of the movie, we would assume that those are simple tender words. However, with our knowledge at the end, we would think that it was a forgiveness and a plea for her mother to go ahead with her birth. 

Why? Being a parent, myself, I can't fathom having my child if I knew for certain that she would have a miserable death, even it I knew that she would bring me immense joy to share her short life with me prior to that death. 

In the context of the end, I think that when the daughter says ""I hate you"" in the opening montage, that was not mere teenage rebellion, but when her mother told the daughter that she has an incurable disease and the daughter connected the dots and figured that her mom knew her fate all along. If the scene I conceived were added, we  could maybe think that the daughter urged her mom to have her, because in the end, the daughter lived and enjoyed her life.

da2dsto,"I really liked the movie but came here specifically to find someone like you who has many of the same grievances as I do.

First a word about the paradox you mention. Not a single thing I've read has taken issue with the paradox regarding how General Shang seemed to know (maybe you could argue that he didn't but I think a close viewing disagrees with this notion) that he needed to show Louise his phone number. Best explanation I can come up with outside the diegetic world is that the non-linear time awareness becomes public knowledge and he manages to put two & two together but that's pure speculation on my part....

I don't necessarily agree that the non-linearity time experience concept was necessarily out of left field, however I absolutely agree that what the movie has to say about it ultimately is wholly unsatisfying. It's never even necessarily made clear that fate in non-deterministic in this universe. Louise asks if you would change your future if you knew it ahead of time, but then proceeds to NOT do so which then raises the question if such a thing was even possible to begin with.

I too agree that there were a lot of other themes which the movie seemed to put forth in the first half but mostly abandoned in the second. I probably would've been fine with it, happy to just acknowledge that the movie went a different way, except that the central concept the movie did wind up settling around, as you say predestination/free will etc., wound up having very little said about in my/our opinion. One may argue that the RW Emerson line about embracing the journey regardless of destination or whatever was it's ultimate point but I personally find that to be a very tired notion and wanted more out of the ""intellectual"" climax of the movie.

Another issue which I'm shocked more people didn't find off-putting (you may have) was that for being such an otherwise ""hard"" sci-fi movie, the notion that fluency in the alien language somehow confers time transcending powers of perception seems very out of place given how grounded everything else in the movie seems to generally be. I understand that the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was specifically brought up to underlie this plot point, but to use it in such a manner is intellectually dishonest/lazy in the exact same way that movies that use quantum mechanic's ""many-worlds hypothesis"" as the foundation for movie universes where a new universe is produced every time a character makes a conscious ""decision."" In both cases, it's not even close to what those scientific hypotheses ACTUALLY mean. The issue is that you can't have it both ways. If you're making a soft sci-fi movie it's ok to play fast and loose with these concepts just as a way of creating an interesting story, but when you make a hard sci-fi movie where everything else is detailed and realistic to the point that you spend time theoretically diagramming a sentence on a white board and using words like ""non-linear orthography"" and ""logogram"" it's awkward to just toss in a heaping side of pseudo-science 2/3 of the way through.

That all said I think it's the best movie I've seen all year and I loved it. Villenueve is a visual genius. Music is perfect. Atmosphere, sound, mise en scene, all tip top.

The military was inept. The concept of viewing time via language made no sense. The bomb was kind of lame.

What the hell is the significance of her personal story with the kid if there are no choices, wasn't everyone way more curious about what's gonna happen in 3000 years?  I know I was. Also, why is everything the aliens do so inefficient if they know the future? You're telling me the only way humanity will unite is if they're tricked into it by potentially hostile aliens? The Aliens already know English, so just tell us the deal, right, I can't come up with a reason they didn't just spell it out... Oh, you're telling me humanity needed to be tested before you'd let them help in 3000 years, I don't buy it.  I would've been ok with this movie if everyone wasn't up it's butt so much, Is no one else pissed that the entire plot surprise/twist falls apart if you omit the scene in the beginning that tricks the audience into thinking her daughter had died already. Like what the hell was that? You show us some ""memories"" of her daughter dying and then show us that she's all upset and can barely walk through the campus, also the call from her mother... What the hell, of course, the audience will assume exactly what you wanted, and without that trick, the movie kinda sucked.

Does that mean you wish you never were born?

Everyone is born with the end always predestined to be unpleasant. When you decide to have a child, you know at some point that child will die, maybe young, maybe after a long life.

A twist implies that a movie led you to believe one thing and then revealed that what you were expecting was actually something else. Taking the obvious example of the Sixth Sense, the direction and script is intentionally framing, perhaps contriving things in such a way that you assume certain things, and the ""twist"" trades on those assumptions and the shock of ""tricking"" the viewer. In a way, it requires deceit. The great thing about this movie is that it didn't lead you to believe *anything*. Both the audience and the characters have no idea who the aliens are or why they are here, and the tension built from that lack of knowledge is what carries the first two thirds of the movie. When the reveal happens, it's doesn't have the ""gotcha"" feel of most big twists, it simply is an answer to the question that everyone has been asking the entire movie.

In other words there is only one timeline. Louise does use the future to ""manipulate"" the present but she isn't really changing anything she is more just drawing from a memory to help her understand the present and the memory happens to be from the future, if that makes any sense. So my interpretation of your theory would sound more like; the heptapods came to Earth to save humanity because they knew that humanity would save them from some threat in 3000 years. Perhaps the threat was that humanity would wipe them out but it never actually happens since there is only one timeline(non-linear time-circle) and no time travel. So from that perspective it doesnt really matter what the threat was because it was never actually going to be carried out either way.

""I liked to imagine the objection as a Borgesian fabulation: consider a person standing before the Book of Ages, the chronicle that records every event, past and future. Even though the text has been photoreduced from the full-sized edition, the volume is enormous. With magnifier in hand, she flips through the tissue-thin leaves until she locates the story of her life. She finds the passage that describes her flipping through the Book of Ages, and she skips to the next column, where it details what she'll be doing later in the day: acting on information she's read in the Book, she'll bet one hundred dollars on the racehorse Devil May Care and win twenty times that much.
The thought of doing just that had crossed her mind, but being a contrary sort, she now resolves to refrain from betting on the ponies altogether.
There's the rub. The Book of Ages cannot be wrong; this scenario is based on the premise that a person is given knowledge of the actual future, not of some possible future. If this were Greek myth, circumstances would conspire to make her enact her fate despite her best efforts, but prophecies in myth are notoriously vague; the Book of Ages, is quite specific, and there's no way she can be forced to bet on a racehorse in the manner specified. The result is a contradiction: the Book of Ages must be right, by definition; yet no matter what the Book says she'll do, she can choose to do otherwise. How can these two facts be reconciled?
They can't be, was the common answer. A volume like the Book of Ages is a logical impossibility, for the precise reason that its existence would result in the above contradiction. Or, to be generous, some might say that the Book of Ages could exist, as long as it wasn't accessible to readers: that volume is housed in a special collection, and no one has viewing privileges.
The existence of free will meant that we couldn't know the future. And we knew free will existed because we had direct experience of it. Volition was an intrinsic part of consciousness.
Or was it? What if the experience of knowing the future changed a person? What if it evoked a sense of urgency, a sense of obligation to act precisely as she knew she would?""",5cc7fb

deqyd6p,"I can't imagine what losing a child must be like, but here's some thoughts to consider:

Firstly, it's important to understand non-linear time as Louise & the heptapods experience it has no past, present or future and that without those, there can be no decision making as that requires a future for your actions to influence.  In non-linear time what happens, as it happens, just *is*.

From Louise's perspective her entire life is experienced as we experience the present.  Their daughter's life and death isn't something that happens in the future, it's something she's experiencing and is powerless to change.  Ian knows the future too, because Louise tells him what happens.  But rather than embrace the time they have with their daughter, his anger and grief leads him to leave Louise. 

Louise, or your wife in your case, would be as equally powerless to influence the future from a linear perspective of time as Ian and you are.  Knowing what will happen, doesn't change what will happen.  It boils down to determinism.  If you could make a machine that knew both the state of everything in existence and how it's all expected to act, then it could *know* what happens next but couldn't change it (as everything, including the machine and the person being told the future will act exactly as they are expected to act).

Random observation: those ships are wedge shaped right? Like slices of an orange. Do you suppose if you assembled all 12 they'd make a sphere?",5cc7fb
d9xc2ni,"For the ""Why 12 Shells"" question, I believe the answer the movie provides is the correct one: Ian indicates that the massive ""drop"" of symbols they receive is only 1/12th of an entire set. As Louise begins to learn their language, she begins to perceive time non-linearly. As part of this, she is able to gain her own future knowledge of the Universal Language and apply that to the ""now"" timeline.

That being said, the reason she is able to write the Universal Language book is likely because, after succeeding in getting all Nations to share their information, they are able to take the 12 data dumps and combine them, from which I presume Lousie constructs the book. All of these actions/points in time can be viewed as a sort of self balancing overall state. Louise can read the language in the ""now"" only because she writes the book in the future only because she unites all 12 groups to share their information in the now, something that wouldn't have happened if she couldn't have read the language already anyways. Kind of a circular reasoning loop, but such is the nature of stories that take place in non-linear time.

I believe that the alluded to secondary goal of requiring Humans to ""come together"" to combine the 12 parts was the primary reason for this. In this, the aliens accomplished two goals: provided the Universal Language, and united Humans across the planet. Both of these actions would seem to be necessary for Humans to progress to the point where they can actually provide the required assistance in 3000 years.",5cc7fb

dbr1dwt,"What I don't get is in order for General Shang to have learned the language over 18 months, we are assuming that China did not in fact attack the aliens due to the intervention from Louis. However, China's decision not to attack the aliens depends on General Shang's decision to share his private number to Louis. Louise's decision to call Shang is predicated on General Shang's future-self to pass on this message 18 months later, but his future-self can't exist unless Louise calls Shang. How does this make sense? It seems paradoxical.

Also why does louise look surprised and doesn't remember that she called Shang, even though it was her decision to call him against federal protocol that led to deescalation of war? I'm assuming press was all over how Louise has an ability to perceive time non-linearly and called Shang to de-escalate the situation (otherwise, she would be in jail for what she has done). Did her present self somehow take over her future self for that instance, which led to temporary amnesia?",5cc7fb

If I remember correctly, Paul could see time laid out as a series of possibilities and he could see what path led to what outcome, while in this movie the premise is that time has already happened and the path one takes is already set. That doesn't mean you didn't have any choices to make, it means that the there was one outcome and that was determined by the choices you already made.  Even if you had knowledge of the future, you made choices and the future contains those choices. ",5cc7fb

EDIT: To add to the comments made by u/AyeDennis and u/summer_of_fireflies. Louis's reply ""Yes.

In the specific scene, right after Ian asks the question (and BEFORE Louis replies), there is a flash*forward* and Louis sees numerous instances of her daughter enjoying life, and then replies to Ian ""Yes"".

Humanity perceives time like its on an endless roller-coaster going backwards.  They can see where they've come from and experience the ride as it currently is, but they cannot see where the roller coaster is going. 

The aliens however are sat on the coaster sideways.   They can look in one direction to see where the rollercoaster has come from, they can experience the ride as it currently is, and they can look in the other direction to see exactly where the ride is going.  As Louise starts to understand the aliens language, it start to effect how she perceives the rollercoaster so that she ends up sitting sideways like the aliens.

However, as per the short story its based upon the direction the rollercoaster is going is fixed.  Its explained in the short story that we live in a deterministic universe and free will is exercised by not affecting the outcome of events.",5cc7fb

Writing heptapod seems to have to do something to perceive a whole concept at once and simply express it. You can see that when Louise is asked by Abbot to write on the board, it's simply in her and she just puts it on the wall.

Ofcourse is all a theory and different understanding of how time is perceived. We think linear so we only see our past live our present and wonder or try to forge about the future.

They on the other hand perceive things in a different way so even though maybe they know they are going to die they cannot change anything.

She asks Ian the question that if you know how your life would turn out would you change anything?

It was the premise of the film - what does someone do when given the ability to see your entire life. Do you still live it or do you change it. Louise chooses to live it because the alternative would have been not experiencing all those things that she would later cherish (with her husband and her daughter) despite the things she'd lose (ironically, her husband and her daughter).

It started when one soldier was talking to his wife on the phone earlier in the movie. She was distraught and scared that the ""monsters"" would kill everyone. You can see the idea being born there because the soldier just wanted to protect his family from the unknown. I think this builds on the difference between seeing time as linear versus nonlinear.

Same way that the aliens had to sacrifice Abbott in order for their plan to work out and lead to peace/progress down the road, Louise realized that the journey of having Hannah is a worthwhile sacrifice for the greater good.

Ian didn't grasp it though - which is why he left Louise because of her ""wrong choice"". She didn't have a choice, neither of them did.

That's not it. He leaves her because she knew their kid would die when they agreed to make one and she didn't tell him then. ",5cc7fb
ddii71d,"Here is from what I understood.

First we need to think that the future can't be changed no matter if you can see it or not, the moment you are able to see the future the future that was 'written' before you could see it doesn't change for a different future 'written' based on what you saw. A better way to understand it is watching the movie Timelapse (2014).

After knowing this, we need to remember that (from at least what the movie shows) they can only see the future of themselves. So, we can maybe assume that they can live for 3000+ years (the last bit doesn't answer anything, but it's good to know).

Also, each of the Heptapods knew what they were to do and they couldn't change it. 

1) Because then there would be no distrust between these countries and she (forgot her name) wouldn't call the Chinese president that in consequence offered to give the research and be more open (or something like that), which then we can presume the other countries followed it.
Let's imagine if it just happened in America though, now imagine all the news around the world about it and now imagine what other countries would do if the US wanted to hide everything for security. I don't think it would work, and the movie would take a totally different thing to focus.

2) They didn't choose. Yes, it would, but you already know why they didn't choose someone else. 

Side notes) Amy (hey, thanks for remembering me her name) has the grasp about time, they don't really have it. Imagine if all your life you could ""live"" in different times and everyone else did the same, time would lose it's meaning because there is no linear time for them.Also, because of that they already lived and talked to humans so many times that they know their language, but using their (Heptapods) words to write the human words teach the humans about their weapon/language little by little, reason why Amy starts to get visions and confuses future with present reinforcing their lack or difficulty to grasp time in a linear fashion. When Amy talks one on one to the Heptapod is when she completely learned about their language, which enables her to translate their time in numbers (maybe? I'm not entirely sure), but how could she learn it in that moment so fast is probably the visions about the future teaching her.

One of the shots there even shows Louise seeing the ink language in 3D (not only from the front but from above) for the first time. It's clever, since we can't observe the 4th dimension, the movie chose instead to downgrade us to 2D and represent the heptapods in 3D instead of trying to literally push the 4D like Interstellar did, distinguishing the former film from the latter.

The heptapods' chamber is low in gravity and well-illuminated, which not only works as a physics plot-point that this is the heptapods' livable environment, but also symbolic of a place of clarity and the unbounded. There, Louise is in enlightenment process.",5cc7fb

daaloz5,"The interstellar drive (as elaborated in great depth in terms of folding into a higher spacial dimension in one of the top comments and mentioned by /u/dangerwig) seems to be the implied immediate meaning.

I also think it's interesting to look at symbolically.  

The heptapods could be read as representing an encounter with the unknown, full of potential for both transformation and destruction (I'm channeling [Dr. Jordan Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AESMraB4qt4) here who's in turn reading from Jung).  They appeared from nowhere, speak languages we don't understand, float around in a fog (think of the role of fog in the sense of ""fog of war"" or the clouds of heaven).  Their appearance is terrifying (squid-like, like a leviathan maybe, threatening) but also kind of like a hand (hand of God?).  

Louise often positions herself as the one most willing to encounter the unknown.  The only exception I can think of is her hesitation on the first trip up the hallway.  Other than that, she's the first to try to communicate with the unknown, the first to take her suit off and greet it directly, and after the rest of humanity is starting to reject it, she takes a huge leap of faith to run after it into the field.  There she's transported directly into the presence of the fog and the hand of God, where she learns the Word that will reunite humanity and save both us and the gods themselves in 3000 years.

On that reading, I took the disappearance to mean that the critical lessons that Louise and her contemporaries could have learned in the presence of the unknown had been learned, so the current manifestation of the unknown naturally retreated and disappeared as if it had never been there in the first place (because when you understand what was once unknown retroactively, doesn't it feel kind of like it was known and understood all along?).",5cc7fb

As far as the drawing of the bird, I don't think it's the same one but it's possible they got a similar bird as a pet.

Edit: instead the story just had a 'gotchya!' moment to the audience and it was like this weird/disappointing 'oh ok' (I'm not a huge fan of twists unless everything about the directing/writing is coherent; in this case, it wasn't coherent because the use of flashes in the beginning broke code with the use of flashes later in the film... and the only reason that was done was to mislead the audience... which is stupid)",5cc7fb

There were some narrative issues and what I would call cheap tricks to promote confusion in order for the big reveal to be more dramatic. 

Through what we perceive as flashbacks and a visually depressing atmosphere, the audience is led to believe that the daughter has already died and that Amy Adam's character is in a state of depression right from the beginning of the movie. But come to find out that the daughter doesn't even exist yet and Adams doesn't have the power of time perception. Or does she?

While this can be semi-explained away by the whole time perception reveal, I think that is where we start getting into the whole 'using sci-fi concepts to create open to interpretation narratives' to come off as cheap.

In addition, I thought that the pacing was also off. While the tone wasn't great, I thought the concept of the movie was good in regards to the communication subplot with aliens right up until the point where it became a sudden race against time scenario with an overly dramatic jump in her realization of what their language means. 

I guess for me, I felt like the whole thing was a mash up of several different sci-fi movies including Interstellar, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind but the elements it borrowed were not done as good as the original. Throw in the over-stylized look of it all and it comes off as a primer/audition piece for something more mainstream like I don't know a Blade Runner remake or Dune...

By this time it would have been figured out that if you immerse yourself enough in learning the alien language you can acquire the ability to see your own future.   This would be relatively common knowledge- at least to all at the dinner and definitely to all that were involved in the original arrival.

He's very, very deliberately giving her the information because he knows that's how he got it and has no choice but to fulfill his role.",5cc7fb
d9y6cdn,"1) Louise started having those flash forwards with her daughter from learning the alien language, not the other way around. Once they started she was able to learn the language faster by viewing her life in the future. This is exemplified when she sees herself read her own book on the alien language, or during the party. As the language is a tool to view ones own lifetime, she is able to view her past/present/future life all at the same time.  
  
She did not decide to have a daughter. From the beginning of the movie the flash forward events and voice over is presented from Louise's perspective after she learned the heptapod's language. Perhaps Louise is at her daughter's deathbed and she finally explains everything she knows. While the question of having a daughter even though knowing she would die young is a fascinating one, I don't think the movie presents it as simple as just that.  
&nbsp;  
2) During the conversation with General Shang, Louise in the future already knew his private phone number and his wife's dying words, but until that moment she has not been specifically told either. Which means that past Louise has no way of knowing it. The general in the future is aware that Louise's mind works on a non-linear time basis. Louise says she doesn't know, what she definitely does, so that her past self can see that moment and learn the information. General Shang helps out in this kind of ploy, as his mind about the aliens was changed and Louise helped him avert a catastrophe. In the past he did not know how Louise could know, but in the future he has some idea, but might find it mind boggling or confusing.  

She never really 'flashes back' to use the information, as the story is told from future Louise's perspective. Future Louise performs certain actions to benefit her past self, as with reading her book on heptapod's language. Her past self views those times and is able to gain knowledge she didn't or couldn't otherwise have.

2. I think it has to do with the nonlinearity of her experience. When describing the language of the aliens they say it conveys all of the meaning at once. There is no left to right, start to finish of the sentence. So to us that time is two seperate points. The phone call then 18 months later, the meeting. To her it is one experience. At least that is how I interpreted it.",5cc7fb
dd6cjx8,"1.)
No, this film imply that the future is set in stone - hence Louise's acceptance of her daughter's fate - and it then logically follows that free will is an illusion, which in turn absolves everyone for responsibility for any action.

In that sense it is one of the most anti-christian mainstream films in a long time.

You have no purpose, you have no say, you are a slave to the universe. It is rather depressing thought that someone would go through life knowing that. I am not sure if the film implies that all mankind will be given this ""gift"", but i so, wow, that is the most dystopian ending ever.

Of course, Louise may be wrong, and it IS possible to to have a say in life, but if that is so, her delusion caused by the aliens may have made her responsible for her own daughter's unnecessary death, by *choosing* not to fighting the disease.

A nightmarish though for any parent and an equally depressing ending. But if that were the case, she would only have had a vision of a possible future, and that would go against the whole idea of s nonlinear perception of time. So no, you cannot change anything by knowing the future.

2)
She should have remembered. Or rather, she should not have gotten the number at all according to the film's internal logic. The film tell us about how the alien language makes us able to perceive time nonlinearly. But that scene does not rely on nonlinear time perception, but on messing with causality. Here something happens later, that affects something earlier. She does not initially remember it in the future, it has not happened in the past until he says it in the future. THEN she remembers it. It is inconsistent with the rest of the film.

One tentacle is works on one side and the other hand works on another end, they both come together to meet in the middle and completing the ""idea/sentence"".

It's not that time is literally perceived simultaneously (unlike the tesseract of Interstellar). The entire ""circle"" of events are simultaneously being created. To apply that to the story, she's thinking about the current ""problem"" (which is how to stop the attack) thus she's able to be in both ends of the event, not reading it like a story. The end of the problem = Gen. Shang giving her the details of how she is to convince him). Both the beginning and end of the ""How to stop the attack problem"" created the middle(gen shang giving the number and phrase). The middle is basically additional context to whole story(logograph) which in turn completed the circle of event's intended meaning/series of events.

Since the future gen. Shang is also able to interpret the iconography he is manipulating the course of history by giving her the key to change his mind. His circle intersects with her circle. Her circle is the ""problem"". The ""problem"" is ""How to stop the attack"".](#spoiler)

Usually, higher education is needed to be part of the latest in travel technology. I remember hearing three reasons we might be visited by aliens: for study, or partnership, for conquest.

I think the first two that are most plausible, the first more so. Why would they need to conquer a race? Resources, and/or labor. It's hard to believe they'd risk being killed on earth, when mars and Venus can be stripped of everything useful without natives with nuclear weapons getting in the way. Hell, think of all the extraction equipment they'd put at risk. Not worth it. Same goes for labor, assuming technological advancement to reach the stars, I think they would have automated much more than we have. And our automation (in the most developed countries) is highly impressive. 

If they got here to basically give humanity interstellar technological charity (partnership), it would be a bit risky (technology falling into the wrong hands and all)... But I think to myself ""Is reverse engineering very advanced technology even possible?"". Imagine handing a monkey an ipad, set to a drawing app. They'd be able to use it and understand how to draw.

Not necessarily. We don't often realise but the language we speak influences how our brain processes our experiences. For example, the Himba people in Africa can very easily distinguish extremely similar shades of the same colour but have a lot of trouble seeing the difference between cyan and green. This is due to the way their language deals with words for different shades and colours.

If we consider how we experience time to be just a case of perception and not a physical constant, it's possible (although a big movie sized leap) to see that language could influence that perception. ",5cc7fb

d9x1d12,"I honestly agree entirely, and your experience sounds identical to my own. I thought the concepts were interesting, and the technical elements were all terrific. Emotionally the film just didn't grab me, it felt like simple melodrama masquerading as philosophy. It was just strange how it turned into Tree of Life in the final 10 minutes. The film never asked me to care for these characters and instead trusted that the concept on its own was deeply emotional. In Interstellar, on the other hand, it features more interesting and unique portrayals of scientific concepts, and also developed characters I cared about so the film had emotional pay off. I found the characters boring here, and I also found the resolution at the end predictable (although I don't think it was supposed to be a shocking revelation given all the groundwork had been clearly set for it). 

I'd probably give it 6/10. Plenty to like, to me it really failed to elevate above a concept movie, and the concept I honestly didn't find too unique given recent films, the only twist on it was the language element.",5cc7fb

d9x4jmm,"> how unrealistic the human's response was to the aliens

Loved the movie, but this was a sore point with me - why be aggressive at all towards the alien BEFORE they've shown any kind of aggression towards Earth? 

Two results are possible from a fight with the aliens:

* They blow them up.  
* They can't scratch them at all.  

If they blow them up then ""that was easy"" everyone says, but what's the point of starting that conflict early?  You don't know what the result would be and you gain nothing.

Even if you do destroy them,  what are the repercussions of that action?  Does an interstellar revenge fleet arrive 7 years later?   Is that fleet already in the Solar System waiting on the result of first contact?

In both cases there is absolutely nothing to gain by early action.  IMO until some aggression from aliens is apparent, Earthers would sit back and gather as much intelligence as they can.  

And that is the main point.  Gather intelligence, keep talking.  That is the rational response and I believe that everyone would do.

They would also never evacuate their camp. They have someplace else they need to be?  Stay on your post soldier and do your job would be their orders.  

Sure I can see some irrationality from the public to be in the mix - riots in the street, stock markets crash, etc.  But for everyone certain it's the end, I'm sure you'd have as many certain the aliens are the saviors of mankind.  I was disappointed there was NOT ONE positive reflection on their arrival, or even a discussion of motives, shown on the TV.  There was not even a discussion of motives at the camp. 

As for the nations, sure they can be dumb, selfish and self centered, but they would consider their actions more carefully than what was shown here.

Loved the movie. Love Amy Adams - she'll always be Giselle to me - and she's always good.  But I like movies to have depth at all levels.  IMO the response, the reactions, and the undercurrent were shallow and lacking, and it took something away from the rest.",5cc7fb

As the final scene played out I couldn't help but think of Nolan, and in turn Interstellar. I too felt as if the ""twist"" never blew my mind...as if part of me already questioned the chronology of the flashbacks. One big thing that I kept hoping would be explained was why the Chinese general offered up his phone number and told Louise what to say to him...at that point I wondered: has the General figured out the alien language too?

d9ybsvt,"> The ""twist"" at the end was badly handled I felt. You never got any solid clue that they were flash-forwards, nothing that looked out of place, no odd background details, nothing

This is completely wrong! The audience was told the ending twist LONG before they realise it. Heres one example:


The scene regarding Louise and her daughter having a show called, ""Mummy and Daddy talk to animals"" and the daughter presents a picture of what I assumed was just their family on the first viewing. Maybe with a pet or something, I didnt notice the bottom half of the image on first viewing. But looking more carefully on the second, its actually a picture of mum/dad and.... a bird in a cage.
 
So midway through the film the audience has basically already been told the ending. 

'Mummy and daddy talking to animals' - then a picture of mum/dad/bird in a cage. I didnt put everything together by this point, and I doubt many did.

Obviously afterwards we know that mum and dad is louise and ian, and they werent talking to animals / the bird in the cage - but rather they were talking to the heptapods/animals, and the canary was brought along with them while they did it. 

On first viewing this wouldnt make sense because the audience will assume that its a 'memory of the past' of her dead daughter - but its actually in the future and her dauguhter doing a presentation at school essentially of events that are transpiring during the film itself.",5cc7fb
d9y9jyl,"> And where were the armies of other scientists trying to figure out stuff about the ship, like how it stays up there?

>Does Marks ever try talking to the scientists? Find out what they're working on?

Maybe I'm mistaken, but isn't Marks one of the people working in the space ship chamber?

>There is no comradery shown amongst the soldiers.

I don't agree. For me, the film effectively conveyed the camaraderie between the rogue soldiers using very little screen time. It didn't judge or vilify them, which I thought was really cool. 

>You never got any solid clue that they were flash-forwards, nothing that looked out of place, no odd background details, nothing. In the 14-16 years that they took over, something should have changed in some environment

There were some clues, like the weird clay figures the daughter made, Banks telling her daughter to ask her father about the ""sciency"" stuff, the comment about Hannah being a palindrome, and the book Banks wrote about translating the Heptapod language. They didn't spell it out, but they definitely hinted that the chronology of the ""flashbacks"" may not be what we think.",5cc7fb

Not much of an explanation, but I hope that makes you understand why people were okay with things you were not okay with. ",5cc7fb
d9yzfon,"I had been thinking about what bugged me about this movie some more, and I would like to further elaborate on it.

Looking over what happened again, I realized that it lacked conflict. Like, genuine personal conflict of some kind. There should have been two camps for it based on the characters they centered the movie around.

First would be the immediate camp, language vs math. Math is universal, math is pure (it can be argued), science is the understanding of the universe and not subjective, thus can reach out across all boundaries. That should have been Donnelly's argument from the start. It sets him up in opposition to Banks who believes that language can transcend that, but is very subjective. That subjectivity is a whole theme running through the movie, from the whole ""Sanskrit for war"" at the beginning to ""weapon or tool"" at the end. Now, obviously Banks would win her side, but the conflict could lead to mutual respect as they'd both score victories over the course of the conflict, and serve as a basis for the eventual romantic attraction they feel.

Second camp is a bit more removed and comes from the clashing views of Marks/Halpern and the scientists, and that's the irrational vs rational conflict. Marks and fellow soldiers come across, to me anyway, as little more than indictments of the negative effects of talk-radio. I mean, he's right there, he has all the information, he has seen -- for himself -- that the Heptapods have done *nothing* for the months they have been on earth except try and talk to us, but still is the one to attack them at the merest hint of provocation. He is given all the same information as the rest of the characters (literally, since he's in the same room with them), but does not change from the fearful stance of the aliens he had at the beginning. With that podcast it showed that he was willing to take the opinion of someone who did not, and could not, have had all the information about the situation, over both the people that did and his own eyes. He was willing to take his wife as a ""trusted source"" over ""experts"" that his own people called in to deal with the situation. He should have engaged the leads, tried to make him see their way, had some conflict with them, before deciding to just kill everyone because ""they're wrong for trusting the aliens"", or whatever the justification we never saw was.

Halpern was almost as bad, being the archetype of the paranoid CIA spook. He reminded me of Mansley in Iron Giant, but less developed. Again, a character who looks to fit evidence to his preconceived narrative that the aliens are dangerous. There should have been more conflict with them and the scientists over the situation, but we never got it, or what we did get was negligible.

All that back and forth would leave Weber stuck in the middle, as his role clearly wanted him to be, working towards the best, truthful solution (he came back for Banks at the beginning after all, showing he wants the job done right above all else), while at the same time having to fight his own side (the army/government) when they start acting out of line.

That shows us were all the major players stand, it shows us what they are willing to do with information presented to them, and it shows how they change (or not) in the face of the events of the movie. The conflicts drive the narrative.

In the film, it seemed there was no real conflict, and everything was driven forward simply because the plot demanded it. There was so much of this movie that came down to feeling like ""It's in the script"" that I just couldn't appreciate the movie.",5cc7fb
d9ycggp,"I really hate it when people only watch films on the surface level, and excruciating nitpick things like the portrayal of military for instance, like some how a scifi film is supposed to be an actual representation of the current world.

And you also have a lack of understanding about the film director and his usage of characters.

dcitt5v,"> The most idiotic thing was when everyone shut down communications after learning about ""weapons"". Yeah, I have to call crap on that.

Like the smaller countries (again, Aussies, Greenlanders, etc) wouldn't be reaching out to the US if they felt the shit was about to hit the fan is so unrealistic it's crazy.

d9vlyrv,"Have an upvote.

I left this movie feeling angry and disappointed. Then I read the short story and realised why.

The protagonist of the short story is no one's second choice, isn't approached just because she still has security clearance, and doesn't have to prove herself better than a man.

Learning the language gives her the ability to see *her* life *from that point on* as the aliens perceive their lives: as a complete thing, like their sentences. Having wondered about free will, she essentially accepts that this is the ""natural course"" of her life. 

Contained within the years of her Dr Manhattan-like perception she sees her short-lived relationship with the father of her daughter, who grows up, graduates from college, gets a job she loves, and dies‚Äîagain, doing what she loves‚Äîin a climbing accident at the age of 25.

Contrast this with the protagonist of the film, who isn't respected and who has to prove herself through an odd contest over translations (why exactly does her Sanskrit translation persuade the general?)

Learning the language gives her not only the aliens' perceptions, but also a Bill & Ted-like ability to see future discussions of actions she doesn't‚Äîin that future‚Äîremember taking, and from these visions to derive information she couldn't otherwise know, which implies that she (or the Chinese general) has the power to alter the course of events.

So, knowing that her daughter will die pretty horribly of an incurable illness at an early age (apparently much earlier than 25), she makes no attempt to inform the father of this fate before the child is conceived, even though she also knows that eventually telling him will end their relationship and distress their doomed daughter for much of her short life.

Either she *can* change the future‚Äîin which case she's staggeringly selfish in her desire for a few years of parenting‚Äîor she *can't*, in which case how did she manage to forget her future vision of the Chinese general's phone number? How you came by the information which allowed you to save the day (the world?) doesn't seem like the sort of thing that would slip your mind for a year or so.

There have been many reviews comparing this film to Contact, a book about sceptical enquiry which was turned into a movie endorsing faith. Ted Chiang's story seems to have been similarly warped out of shape: the acting, visuals and soundtrack are all excellent, but I can't say I like the implicit message.

PS: it isn't the same place, but doesn't Louise's house look like Baltar's?",5cc7fb
d9vjkqm,"Why didn't Jeremy Renner see the future as well? 
He doesn‚Äôt truly understand the language.
Why didn't he know about the daughter? 
Because he doesn‚Äôt perceive time as Louise does. 
Why did she have a vision where she knew the phone number if she had already called him in that future and thus would know the number while she's talking to the Chinese general? 
In the film, time is a flat circle. Think of time in the movie in the way they discuss how the aliens construct sentences. It happens all at once. She is experiencing the future and present at the same time, like the aliens construct their sentences all at once. 
If she knew the alien language at the end (but the film teaches us that there is no middle, beginning, or end because apparently time is a circle) then why during the course of the film did she not know the language all along? 
In the film, time is a flat circle. It‚Äôs a lot different from it being a circle. She is still experiencing time as each event happens. She cannot experience the past since it has already happened. Again, go back to the alien language. You wouldn‚Äôt be able to construct a sentence that you already wrote, you would only be able to read it. However, she is able to construct the present and future only after being able to truly understand the language. 
Why didn't she tell everyone from the beginning about her convenient time visions and reveal that she knew what was going on all along? 
Because she didn‚Äôt know what was happening all along. 
What is the ultimate point of having a child that you know will grow up to die?
The joy she finds in the life of her daughter overcomes the pain found in her death. Also she isn‚Äôt able to change the future regardless since it‚Äôs happening for her at the same time. 
What was the purpose of the aliens coming at all? 
To teach humanity their language. They came bearing a ‚Äúweapon‚Äù aka their language. For whatever reason, they need humans to understand this. The point of the movie isn‚Äôt to solve the mystery of what happens in 30 years, it is to examine Louis‚Äôs character. 
What gives the alien language the power to time travel and why would they need anyone's help if they have this ability? 
It‚Äôs not time travel. It‚Äôs being able to exist in different points in time. I know that sounds like the same thing, but refer to the sentence analogy. They are able to construct their ‚Äúsentences‚Äù without order. The concept of time is different to them.
Why is she having visions at the beginning of the film when the aliens haven't landed yet? How can she have powers at this point if this crucial event hasn't transpired?
The flash-forwards at the beginning of the film are used for the audience to set up the ‚Äútwist‚Äù. Also, it can be perceived that the entire film is Louise telling her daughter the story of her life (see the short story ‚ÄúThe Story of Your Life‚Äù that the film is based off of).

I know I'm being vague here, but I guess what I want to say is that I encourage you to read the short story if you have these kinds of questions. The story plays with language tenses and goes into the alien language so much more than the movie was able to. A lot of things were sped up or completely left out of the movie because they would have taken up too much time or been too difficult to do.

A couple scenes later she hallucinates the heptapod in the tent. 

When she walks by the news crowd its because she just doesn't really care about whatever everyone's crowding around. The first-time viewer assumes it's because she's emotionally numbed by the loss of her family, but it turns out she's chronically depressed for other reasons.

Regarding the reference to the portuguese language, I am also intrigued by her statement.
Although I am unable to think of an answer to your question, it is true that Portuguese as a language evolved in the region of Galicia (at the time an independent kingdom comprising part of northern Portugal) between the 10th and 13th century.
This language is called Galician-Portuguese and sounded more like Castillian (Spain's official language).
Of course, after Portugal obtained its independence from the Kingdom of Le√≥n in late 12th century, there was a natural departure from that common language as this new Nation was forming.
When King D. Afonso II died in 1214 he wrote his testament - not in Galician-Portuguese - but in Portuguese. This 800 year old document is considered by scholars the first document ever written in Portuguese. I've read it many, many times and it never fails to make me think of how languages are always evolving.

db4yi4v,"""The central drama of will the aliens help or hurt us, will we communicate, will we die... is irrelevant.""

I don't think the central drama was whether or not the aliens were here to destroy us or not.  Nothing in the film indicated they had hostile intentions, and the moment it was suggested that something they said might have been threatening, the protagonist immediately clarifies that the translation was probably misleading, and the audience is given no reason to doubt her.  

The central drama was revealed when [Renner discovers that the gift is only one part of 12, and that if all the other nations don't collaborate, then the gift will be lost.  The chinese weren't risking a war with aliens, but rather destroying a vital piece of the gift.](#spoiler)

I also don't think you can argue that she ruined anyone's life, when the only alternative is to [not bring that life into existence in the first place. It seemed like her choice was to either bring a precious life into the world for a short time, or not bring her into the world at all.  Louise's choice to bring Hannah into the world parallels the heptapod's choice to pass along the gift to humanity, knowing he would die in the result.  Maximize lifespan is pretty shallow meaningless life goal, and while we as a species are very pre-occupied with prolonging our life as much as possible, the unstated premise there is that a meaningful life is more important than a long life, and it just so happens that you can get more meaning out of a life that is long than a life that is short.  but that fact shouldn't discount a short life as having great meaning and significance.  And given all the memories we saw of Hannah, it seemed like she had a good life despite its brevity.  Her decision to hide this from Ian until after Hannah was born might have been questionable, but I kinda think Ian's emotional reaction to it is his problem to deal with.  Hannah shouldn't be denied existence cause her Dad couldn't cope with her brief existence.

The process of decoding the language was, I thought, much better followed in the short story (which you should definitely read if you haven't yet - it's called Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang). Its been a while since I read it, so I might be off on some of details. this is what I remember: 
First they spent a while lot of time on the spoken language, which involved a lot of guesswork and assumptions. It is massively helpful that the heptapods are actually very willing to try to communicate and that their spoken language was not only linear, but also had similar grammatical structures like nouns and verbs. Figuring out the spoken language basically involved a whole lot of looking at waveforms, cutting out distinct parts (those sections that seem to be the same in different samples), labeling them as some possible meaning and then testing back the hypothesis by playing the samples back at the heptapods.
Only after they had a basic understanding of their spoken language did they involve the written one as well, in order to deepen the ability to communicate. With the written language the procedure is more or less the same, by matching spoken sentences they already understand to their written counterpart and singling out parts of the logogram. Interesting to note is that in the story one of the key features of a logogram was that any one part of it informed the meaning of any other, which meant that you had to know what you wanted to write in advance.

I thought the film did a really good job with Heptapod B (written) but kind of glossed over Heptapod A. 

Also worthy of note is the fact that in the short story it took a long time, there were many more ships/points of contact and respectively many more teams that constantly exchanged information. Louise wasn't the only one who learned Heptapod B, and there was also a physics aspect that helped her understating of the time indifference in the language, which I was really disappointed wasn't in the film, but that's a theme for a separate post.

At the beginning of the movie, we get Louise recounting what happened with her daughter - this is what happens in the future, years after the aliens have departed, but when she tells us about this, it has already occurred.

Later on, she has visions of her daughter AFTER she starts to learn the language from the aliens.

They didn't try to learn our language because that was counterproductive to teaching us before we started a war with them or each other. They were giving a crash course and not wasting time going backwards, since if we did get them to speak english they'd say ""We came here to teach you our language, now get back to it.""

For the limited window I've seen an idea posted that maybe it's the same two aliens in each ship. What if they're just visiting everyone separately? I don't think the movie shows anything to contradict that. The way they materialize their ships in and out of our dimension might suggest they wouldn't have trouble hopping from one ship to another.

It wasn't that she could see the future once she learned the language. It was that with the language she experienced all time in her life simultaneously.

I think they kind of muddied the point when she asks Ian if he would do things different if he could see his whole life, because that's not possible.

The sequence with the general is harder to follow, because she's basically ""remembering"" something from the future that hasn't happened yet, and you can see that even as she's talking to the general, she doesn't seem to know the information yet, or even what information she needs to get from him. I see that scene more like a dream sequence, in that she's seeing a vision of how she might get the info in the future - but when that day actually arrives some time later, it'll no-doubt play out differently, because she'll already know the info - or maybe she'll get the info a completely different way. She's just imagining one way she might get it.

I think the idea is that the two scenes are supposed to be very similar, but it's hard to get our brains wrapped around the one in the future. 

And since we never actually see anything happen after Hannah is born, we don't really know if she ends up doing exactly the same things she saw in her visions or not. When the doctor tells her about Hannah's disease, does she react the same way, with complete shock? We don't know.",5cc7fb

By learning the new language, her brain rewired(which they spoke about in the movie) which helped her to see her future. To her and the aliens, time is viewed differently. For them the the past and the future are like physical objects like Mountains, oceans, etc. You can see all of them right now. But you cannot move/manipulate a mountain/ocean. Hence they cannot change the future if it seems unpleasant. All they can do is accept it and embrace it for all that it has got to offer. Hence, Louis chooses to marry Ian and have a baby despite knowing the fact that her baby will eventually die( due to cancer). She tells all this to Ian so much later in their relationship( after the baby was born). Ian wasn't happy with her decision because she could have chosen to not get into a relationship with him since she knows everything that would happen. Hence, he leaves her.

She only partially knew their language, so she wasn't really able to fully understand what she will have been experiencing, and only got each important ""memory"" in a small fragment. 

When she finally found out it was the future she was experiencing, and started getting more and more used to the non-linear experience, she was more in-control, actually had some meaningful conversations and longer experiences that gave more context. 

Now, tenses. Tense is tricky for talking about future events you've already experienced. I think the, ""I know why my husband *left* me,"" is a reference to experiencing the particular memory by the lake. She didn't have access to every single moment in her future (just like we don't remember every single moment) but having that conversation made things clear, so from that perspective the husband had left in the past (even though both events take place in the future). For the same reason, she mentions, ""I forgot how good it felt to be held by you,"" (exact wording might be off) because she started ""remembering"" these future events, and having those experiences after he left meant she remembers a lot of that time missing him. If she used a ""more correct"" tense, it wouldn't make a lot of sense since she was also just now remembering how much she missed it. 

Finally, I just finished watching it and I'm not sure where she forgets who the child is after she leaves the shell. Leading up to her direct contact, she had visions and dreams that seemed very real and almost like memories, but she knew they hadn't happened to her. After asking, she realizes it's her future, and is in somewhat of a shocked state as she climbs into the car.

I view the whole thing as an interesting look at how a 4th dimensional being might experience 3-dimensional space. Just popping in and intersecting with a slice of the 4th dimension, hanging for a moment in the 3rd dimension, then experiencing another slice some other time and/or place.

dep8smt,"There are different ways to interpret this movie, but I personally like to think that the Heptapod's language simply allowed Louise to remember any given moment in the future as it would occur given who she is at the present moment from which she's seeing her future.  

Think of it this way.  In the [Many Worlds Interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) of quantum physics, every possible future exists, laid out before you like a highway system stretching out into the horizon.  The Heptapod language allows a person to see all points of the road that person is on, until that person makes a decision to turn off onto another road.  Then, that person can see all points of the new road.  

This interpretation explains the surprise Louise experience upon meeting Shang in her memory of the future.  When she makes the realization [that the ""weapon"" the heptopods have given her is one of twelve installments in a heptopod dictionary](#spoiler), it moves her so deeply that it changes the decisions she makes in the future, opening up the possibility for her to speak with Shang, who just moments earlier had [thoroughly alienated her by declaring war on the heptopods](#spoiler).  That moment in her present changed her decision in the future, and the new decision she made in the future provided her new possibilities in the past.

There is, however, absolutely no concrete evidence to support this theory.  It's just my own personal headcannon.  ",5cc7fb
deqfp4j,"She asks him because she's seen her entire future at that point and knows he's going to leave her because he will later find out that she knew their daughter would die as a young adult from a terminal disease.  Ian doesn't understand how heptapods and Louise experience time: it's only possible to change the future if time is linear.  Perhaps the best way to explain it is through a different way of experiencing time: Imagine if you could see your entire life as a 2d picture, you can look at different parts of it, but you can't change it.  This is basically how the heptapods and Louise experience their entire life, except instead of a 2d picture, they experience it as we experience a single moment in time.

Arguably we don't have free will.  Everything we understand acts as it is understood to act (the very foundation of all science, technology and engineering), so if it were possible to make a machine that knew the state of everything in existence and how it is expected to act, then it could predict the future.  Just because we can't possibly make such a machine doesn't mean that the progression of states isn't set in stone.  The fact that we can't make such a machine and don't consciously understand how our own brain is expected to act is what allows us to believe we have free will.",5cc7fb

db36qjs,"Well umm.... ok. Let's go in order. 

1. There's a certain amount of subjectivity here, but personally I think the aliens looked incredibly cool, and I didn't see any issues with functionality. It just seems like you're looking for flaws, and you're not coming up with much. What led you to believe the aliens lacked dexterity? I don't think that point was ever made in the movie. 

2. Time isn't linear. This is interesting for a plethora of reasons, and you seem very quick to dismiss them. It has a number of consequences which are ultimately critical to the plot, and if you ask me it's a pretty unique notion. Care to share another movie that has done this in recent memory? Interstellar deals with relativity, and to an extent a nonlinear time, but definitely in a distinctly different way. And in my personal opinion, to the extent that Interstellar does touch on nonlinear time, it is significantly watered down. Non linear story telling is an incredibly useful and thought provoking film making tool. I take it you're not a fan of Nolan or Tarantino?

3. Knowledge of the future does not imply omnipotence. The aliens experience all time as one. That isn't the same as hopping into a time machine. They needed to reach out for help because *that's what happened.* They can't change the course of time any more than you or I could. 

4. Agree to disagree I suppose. I found Louise to be an incredibly engaging character. Though I suppose it would be easy to miss this when you ignore a major part of her character development, which leads me into the final point.

5. Why the daughter? Well there are a number of reasons for that, the first of which is characterization. But as to your other question of how it moves the plot forward, well that just strikes me as a flawed question. It's based in the assumption that every single element in a movie should solely serve the plot, which is simply not the case. But furthermore, the fact that Louise spent approximately a decade and a half raising her daughter, practically as a single mother, is in and of itself a major component of the plot. But furthermore it opens up a fascinating philosophical conundrum.  Louise spends a significant portion of her life raising a child that she knows will ultimately die. Ian on the other hand decides it is a fate he can't bare. But on top of that, we see that Louise *chooses* to conceive, birth, and raise a daughter she will outlive. This is an incredibly nuanced and intelligent procession of events. It calls into question the entire concept of free will, as well as demonstrates the deep love and joy of parenthood. For as painful as the death of her daughter must have been, the time she spent with her was entirely worthwhile. I think for this reason and many other, this was an incredibly beautiful film, and I hope that at some point you can have the same appreciation for it that I do. ",5cc7fb
d9wdrxp,"I'll agree with you on Renner. He's supposed to be a astrophysicist but spends the movie being Louise' language assistant.

This isn't how we believe our own universe to be, but it's hard to disprove it at this point and it makes for a valid sci-fi premise. The flaw may merely be the assumptions you had going in, which incidentally, is a trait you can use to empathise with the characters.

We already knew that the session as over so anyone going down to the pod and loading stuff into it would presumably be unauthorized, no?

They *were* the security.  The created their own gap in the defenses.  The one main guy (Captain Marks, I think his name was), was part of their escort detail on the first encounter and presumably others.  During that scene you hear confusion on the radio as to ""what's Escort doing out there?"" and things of that nature.  On top of that the identical NBC suits make it hard to identify anyone and determine whether they're actually supposed to be there.  To most it would look like just another normal encounter until they started acting fishy (in fact that's probably what they told anyone who would question them).  

As to the bomb aspect, it looked like just a ton of C4 bricks with a timed detonator.  Not very hard to rig up.  Any soldier with a combat engineer or EOD background could do it easily, probably Infantry too.  Where'd they get it?  Presumably more heavily armed forces weren't too far off in case things turned hostile (I'm not entirely clear on the time skip for when the Armored brigades start rolling up).  C4 isn't hard to find in such a unit's inventory, although that was quite a sizeable quantity.  

>And they were being very tight lipped about their situation, presuming that their communication would of course be monitored so they would not leak any important information to the outside world. So how come they had their macbooks while killing time in the barracks?! They were tuning into a conspiracy theory radio show no problem. They just as easily could have been sending out classified information via email or skype.

I can't give a specific answer since I don't know the logistics of the base they have set up in the movie.  Speaking from experience, phones are only taken away when you enter sensitive areas like a classified workplace.  When you go back to your room, tent, hooch, w/e you have access to normal internet, albeit presumably monitored since it all pipelines through military network infrastructure.  Sometimes the security protocol fluctuates.  Our normal internet and phone access on deployments got cut off any time there was a casualty so news couldn't leak back home before the next of kin could be notified.  Maybe the soldiers' visiting a few inflammatory videos on youtube raised some red flags, but not as much as if they went on a message board saying ""I'mma kill me some heptapods."" they seemed very careful to keep their plan in a small group of conspirators.  Also remember it wasn't just the Alex Jones types that set them off.  It was their families at home begging them to protect them, to keep them safe from the ""monsters"".  In their minds they were just carrying out their oath of enlistment/office.

>This was the only pod to land in the United States. Wouldn't you think that they would have marines or special forces at this small site instead of young army soldiers? Outside of the colonel and the CIA guy, there seemed to be a serious lack of command and ranking power.

Gonna avoid touching on the ""Marines are just a more elite Army"" cliche.  Suffice it to say, each branch has their own unique roles and functions.  As for possible reasons why Army:

- The Army has a more diverse and flexible support structure (communications, Intel, logistics, etc.) than the Marines who are more heavily reliant on the Navy for support.  

- Rural Montana is far from any Marine or Naval base, which are mostly in coastal regions.  It was probably quicker to get an Army unit there first, and the Army would be better suited to inland operations (although the Marines have had plenty of experience with such in Iraq and Afghanistan)

- The ""existing protocol"" mentioned early in the film could have called for the Army to provide security and support for a first contact mission.  

Realistically, there would probably be some squabble in the Pentagon as to who would get ownership of this mission.  Army, Marines, Air Force, SOCOM, Montana NG, and even the Navy would be arguing their case to the SECDEF and/or President.  Even if the Army wins the bid, it would probably make sense to call in individual experts from all the branches, so I'd have expected to see more Marine, Navy and Air Force uniforms in the workplace scenes.  

There probably were Special Ops teams in the area (along with the more heavily armed forces we see later in the movie) in case a mission that meets their skillset arose, but it would be a waste of resources to have them do all the routine security and staffing of the site, especially since the Forward Operating Base would probably be obliterated instantly if things went south.  

>I also found it funny that they did not show any interaction with the President of The United States ever.

That's not too unrealistic.  There's no way they're letting the President close enough to be at risk if the aliens are hostile.  They're not going to put the President in direct communication with the aliens in case he/she says something stupid that undermines the diplomatic and scientific efforts.  The President would definitely be in the loop and making the overarching decisions, but that's going to delegate down through the various chains of command.  Micromanaging everyone from way back in the white house is going to potentially undermine a unit's operating procedure and place too much dependence on a long distance communication stream that could potentially be severed if ""war were declared"".  The President says what he wants done.  The Generals figure out how they will do it and so on down the chain.  ",5cc7fb

Then I disliked the uselessness of Ian. How can a mathematician not be the most useful in this kind of situation? They are not talking to some foreign people, they're talking to an alien species. Imho [-THIS-](https://i.imgur.com/7UNDXV1.jpg) is the closest to the right way to talk with them.

Firstly, Louis says she ""forgot how good it felt to be held by you"", it's because she ""forgot"" how to think non-linearly (really she just hadn't yet learned). Once non-linear thinking is learned, one can see their entire life, so she would have been able to ""remember"" how good it felt because she could see into the future (aka non-linear thinking). 

The only significance I saw with the bird was in the nature in which it's used. When the chemical makeup of the air changes in a negative way, the bird stops chirping. Miners used to use this tactic in mines when trying to avoid odorless, deadly gasses. I think it signifies that a when there is a stop in chirping (talking/dialogue), there is danger/peril.

And because of this, my thoughts shifted to ""hmm, they probably shouldn't let these soldiers talk to their wives precisely for this reason"". This precise reason being a woman hysterically crying and telling her husband to come home for the sake of their children. After all, there are reports of societies and civilisations breaking down as panic spreads throughout the world. You probably want your soldiers away from that and their mind on the fucking job. Not only that, isn't it kinda like a security risk to have your selective soldiers chosen to guard this top secret thing have open communication to their wives whenever they want? Anyways, I dismissed it by saying, eh the soldiers want to talk to their wives. Let them, its probably not a big deal. And then 30 minutes later, the soldiers bomb the alien shell ship that was left unattended by the entire nation of the USA. 

Speaking of riots, would that really happen? I could imagine bunch of whacko religious people like in the newsbeat but a whole society breaking down because of aliens? I don't know but I have a feeling when aliens show up, people aren't going to go around looting and burning shit out of fear. I have a feeling they'll probably just stay home. I mean what were their reasoning for the riots? ""People are upset at how the government is handling the crisis."" What?  How do they know how the government is handling the crisis? Also by the logic of this movie, everyone is supposed to act irrationally. This isn't a real world remember. All those nitpicks I previously mentioned. Its establishing this isn't a real government. This is hollywood government where government is over the top incompetent to satirise the real government and bureaucracy. But then the people inhabiting the world expect their hollywood government to not be be comically militant and aggressive? See what I mean by bad writing? I don't know maybe people would riot for the sake of rioting. But would the NEWS really report on a bunch of fucking riots when there are ALIENS around the whole world. Would people really be out there rioting demanding to know what's going on or would they just be at home watching the news to see the next breaking alien news update. I just think the news would report on aliens landing 12 huge ships on our planet than a bunch of riots. 

Speaking of riots and selective soldiers and ships being left unattended and psychology tests. Why was the alien egg ship left unattended? In all the landscape shots of the ship, you see there's like no security. The military base seems to be the only checkpoint to the ship in the middle of a huge plain. So because there's no security whatsoever soldiers go rogue and try to blow up the aliens. They take the explosives left unattended in their base, then walk to the cars just sitting there with the keys inside it, then they drive to the alien ship with no checkpoints along the way, then they get inside it  with no one even giving a shit even though its 15 minutes till the hole opens, then they go inside and plant a bomb in there. These are the chosen soldiers right? You had a list of a million soldiers to choose from. This is the US military we're talking about. They literally had a list of a million. Then they presumably hand pick these soldiers to guard the biggest threat to not only the US but the world. But evidently, they didn't do some test to see if they were stupid warmongering idiots who shoot first and ask questions second. This we already knew from the fact they didn't test Amy Adams to see if she was some sort of pussy. Anyways, not one, but a GROUP of soldiers go rogue. I mean its probably punishable by death right? A bunch of these soldiers thought to themselves, I'm so scared of this alien space ship so I'm gonna blow it up because I'm so scared and risk military sentencing of death. Remember, they're not doing this to save the world and their families. There's ELEVEN other ships around the world. They're doing it because they're scared and they're constantly seeing news about people rioting and phone calls from their hysterical wives. Again, writer's interpretation of fear = stupid people lash out. 


Anyways, the finale of dumb. The whole world decides fuck it. Lets blow it all up. China says we're mobilising so Russia decides they'll do it as well and then the US tells their scientists to get out of there. Here's the thing. Why does it have to be all or nothing? Do they really think these days, you have to have soldiers kicking down doors and tanks rolling up to shoot at it. Does the writer not realise they have planes now with nukes in them? I believe its what they did in NINETEENFOURTYFIVE. The point is, if they need to fuck up the alien ship, they can fuck it up. Why do they need to evacuate everything to get ready to fuck it up. Sorry scientists, we've decided we're pulling funding on your research program, we've decided to go the militant route instead, your funding has been cut, its time to move out. Have the scientists keep visiting it and whatever. Why do you even care. You're fucking going to war with aliens. You've signed the death of presumably millions of people if not, you're prepared to make those sacrifices. That's what the militant route is right? SO why would you give a fuck if your scientist makes it out or not. Let her keep doing research or whatever so you can get even a little bit more information. If you need to nuke the ship, nuke it. Are you really going to have me believe we're so scared of the aliens we're going to blow it up but we're going to make sure everyone gets out of there alive. Think of it from the movie's perspective. The US government is so scared of the aliens or China or whatever, they are willing to sacrifice Amy Adams. Amy Adams has 2 minutes to call the president of China and tell him the future of the world and his wife's dying message. Instead, what happens is military guys literally point guns at Amy Adams, the linguistics scientist they have worked with for more than a week. That scene summarised what a generic piece of hollywood crap this was. The movie boiled down to protagonist with bad military guys with guns pointed at her. That was our climax.

For the most part, he was there to hold up a whiteboard and look dumbfounded in the background. Several people in my theater fell asleep during the movie as well. Im fine with slow burners but I felt like this one was really boring and did not do much to keep it interesting when they weren't inside of the pod. ",5cc7fb
d9xmnvb,"I watched the film yesterday and absolutely loved it. You make interesting points, ill try give my comments as to how I interpreted it. 

Points 1 and 2: all the flash ""backs"" and forwards, while at the beginning I too thought it was sequential thereafter and was confusing, Louise is narrating the whole film from that point I think? And I think it's to further reinforce the notion of a non - linear time line

3: yeah the CGI and her hair moving around was a little awkward, but I thought it was to show the different molecular/atmospheric makeup that the heptopods live in which humans would clearly not survive in (which is why she got sprayed with some gust before entering)

4: renner thought he deciphered what the message was meaning, since he was able to identify the symbol of time and after searching that symbol he saw it repeated everywhere to think that it was a message teaching humans the algorithm to understand time or something, but we find out later that that message saying that the language itself is a gift to them which will make them understand time differently. 

5: Perhaps, but this movie deviates from other sci-fi movies to the extent that it really informs us more about humanity than the aliens. So yeah they weren't central to the plot but important because since they perceive time in a non - linear way, they are trying to help us to be able to help them 3,000 years later. 

It was quite slow, but I think that helps give weight to how momentous each feat of communication was. Ah anyway, really didn't have much to add, I guess I just really enjoyed this movie and wanted to talk about it",5cc7fb

6. Yeah it was slow. It was paced. Don't watch intelligent sci fi if you don't like that because that's how it rolls. I thought it was perfectly paced.

dbqk8il,"To me the Sapir-Whorf-Hypothesis is the very point of the movie: It states (in its strong claim, which is highly doubtable) that if you only immerse deep enough in a language you can see reality in a totally new way. In this movie reality is depicted as a four-dimensional space, where the time-dimension can in principle be seen in its entirety, with the past and the future being just as real as the present, just given the right tools (the language). It's like seeing objects very far away given the proper means - we tend not to claim that the location we take up in space is more ""real"" than others.

Therefore the movie is almost certainly not about ""time travel"". Otherwise it would have carved out the classical time travel paradoxes, which really would have made for a blunt plot. In fact i think the essence of this movie is the highly philosophical question asked somewhere near the end: ""if you could see you whole life in its entirety, would you change something?"" As someone pointed out here, it is a question famously negated by Friedrich Nietzsche in a motto he called ""Amor Fati"":

>*My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity.

That's my take on it. Louise can see the future, she knows there is pain in it, but she won't change it, as the happyness it'll bring her is worth it.  Not sure how it translates to how humanity is going to perceive it, however...",5cc7fb

d9vmycj,"Based on the theory of [Linguistic Determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_determinism), which states that language shapes the way we perceive the world around us,  learning the alien language allows a human to perceive time non-linearly. Basically, because Louise perfectly learned the Heptnapoid language she could see the future, meaning she could experience any and every moment of her life at will.

Knowing that her child would die and her husband would leave because of it, she chose to go through with it. Ian leaves her because she does it all, even knowing that their daughter would waste away from an incurable disease. Ian likely views it as cruel, forcing a child to live through a doomed existence, but Louise could feel holding her daughter for the first time, playing with her throughout her childhood, etc., and decided it was worth it.

I think the question the movie wants its audience to ask is could she have changed it? Is the future set in stone, like a railway track through time? Also, is it ethical to have a child even knowing she will have the disease? Because pretty soon genetic testing will allow us to check for those diseases early.",5cc7fb

d9yeanq,"1. I don't think it gives individual meaning, it just gradually unlocks the ability to perceive non linear time once you're fluent.

2. Because they accomplished their mission of teaching enough of their language to Louise that she now could eventually pass on the gift of non linear time perception to the rest of the human race when she writes her book some 15 years later or however later that was.

3.  Because those are flashforward memories that take place in the future years after the heptapods left.

4.  Maybe.  But the concept of a palindrome kinda ties into the idea of non linear time, no matter which direction you read the word the information is the same, it's a loop.

5. The science behind this part confuses me the most, but it's probably because he has no free will and it's the result of him coming into contact with someone who has non linear time abilities in the past (via the phone) which bridges a connection to his future self thru Louise, and his future self may have the beginnings of non-linear abilities which to him feel more like urges, that he is compelled to do it.  My theory on the science behind it is it's like the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics, where every possible outcome of an action has played out in an infinite number of universes, but only the outcome that happened to be observed becomes the final outcome that was written to history, and all those alternative universes collapse into that final one.  I think with the Arrival, the universe is created in a big bang or whatever and instantly goes through all possible outcomes at once until a sort of final balance happens and all of history from start to finish is written in stone.  Those who perceive time as linear experience the illusion that they have free will, that they're in control of the choices and decisions they make.  Those who experience non linear time get to enjoy the full breadth of it like watching their favorite movie over and over ... They're never really alive or dead, they just exist.  But I think ultimately, people in this universe do have free will, they had it in the infinite number of choices they made when the universe was first created and was a soup of uncertainty until everything settled into its final state.

6. It means both weapon, gift, tool.  Those who can see the future have an advantage over those who can't.  Ex: Louise using her ability to get Shang's phone number and wife's dying words from the future.

7. No. I think her asking what day it was was to illustrate her beginning to experience non linear time in a more conscious way, rather than just vague dreams and memories.

8. No. Once you master non linear time perception you just exist.  Perhaps you're less of a person in control and more of just a spectator watching your own life.

9. Not sure why they did it in the world of the film, but from a movie making stand point, to add dramatic tension and make it seem like the ships were getting ready to destroy Earth.

10.  No. I don't think the ships can physically travel through time, just the heptapods consciousness.  Ships were using some sort of advanced gravitational wormhole technology.

5) He also said ""I don't know how your brain works"" and since this is the future it's possible that it's after she wrote her book ""The Universal Language"" and Chen has already read it. We can safely assume that it's common knowledge that she has some special understand beyond everyone else at this point. The act itself is a time paradox and a self fulfilling prophecy. Think of it as the opposite of the grandfather paradox which states that if you went back in time and murdered your grandfather you would never have been born to go back in time in the first place; this a paradox. In this case it's the opposite and self fulfilling. It's because she looked into her own future and saw the number that gained his trust so that in the future he now trusts her and shows her his number. The isolated chain of events are all interdependent. A complete circle that can be explained in either direction. To us this seems like effect preceding cause, but it's more like   **{effect <-> [cause} <-> effect]**  except we cannot perceive the chain in the square brackets, but Louise can.

8) No, think of it like fast forwarding or rewinding your life. For us time is linear and we exist at a single point along a straight line. Different points on that line correlate to different points in time. We cannot alter our position on this line because we exist on it. This is why we exist ***in*** the 4th dimension and can manipulate the other 3 dimensions below us. Since Louise learned the gift to change her position on that line she can actively change her current point in time but only wherever she exists on it.

The flashes didn't change in composition whatsoever, and so the filmmakers & directors just altered the device's meaning and said ""gotchya! quite a twist, eh?!"" but it wasn't.

It'd be like if I handed you a deck of cards and asked ""is that a deck of cards?"" and you go ""yeah"" and then I replaced it with another deck of cards that look exactly the same and said, ""is that a deck of cards?"" and you go ""yeah"" and I replied ""HAH!

>Had a lot of issues with this film, but the most nagging one is simply why all of that attention on the bird? The animal has zero to do with the plot yet is focused on several times throughout. For a movie that is so horribly paced, why waste time on that? 

I saw the focus as both a visual/metephorical one (caged animal, people are currently caged in time), a practical one (explaining why they take off their masks), and a foreshadowing one. The bird is in Hannah's drawings on her mom/dad doing the ""reality"" show. It's a spoiler hidden in plain sight. 

>Also, did Louise get affected by taking off her suit and passed on something to the kid? 

Dang, maybe. Only Louise and Ian had their stuff off. It's a very rare disease. The doctor also makes a passing comment about nothing showing ""yet"". Foreshadowing?

>We never find out who the aliens are,

They're creatures that see time as non linear, I personally think that's a pretty huge insight as to how different their lives are from ours.

>why they look like space squids,

When Louise enters their atmosphere it's like she's in water. So that's probably why, their home environment is similar to our ocean to they resemble an animal from our ocean. 

>what they'll need from us in 3k years, or where they are from.

By the time Louise finds out they need our help in 3000 years, she's still in the middle of realizing she can see the future and wrapping her head around it. She doesn't talk to the heptapods ever again. There's no real time/place for those questions in the movie. Personally I love that they left it open for interpretation because the theories and discussions have been really interesting to read.


>CGI Amy Adams looked worse than CGI Leia. 

It looks like they filmed in water.

>Writers missed out by not having Renner also say no when asked if pregnant. 

I was fully expecting that! haha

>The inability to hear the dialogue over random tech sounds or helicopters. 

I've been around helicopters and I love that they did that. They are sooooo loud.

>How does the bomb smash through thr barrier and kill Costello? 

Why wouldn't it? We're never told their stuff is indestructible. 

>Why is the President never involved. 

The secretary of defense is though which is pretty realistic.

>Why don't the aliens stay and teach us their advanced technology?

If they needed to help us further, they would've stayed.

>Why does Amy Adams constantly have to breathe heavily and keel over to display confusion & anxiety? 

She's having periods of seeing in to the future. The original viewing has you think it's anxiety and confusion, but really she's seeing time as non linear for the first time. It's disorienting. One minute she's in the ""present"" and the next she's 10 or so years in the future. None of the other characters understood the language enough as she did to have that happen to them, so she's the only one experiencing it.

>How the woman is the only one who's shaking the whole time during 1sr contact? 

It wasn't first contact for anyone but Ian and Louise. Everyone else has been there before. Ian is shown to have difficulty with it too, he actually throws up after.

>The classroom scene was a joke. Made no sense that she just went home to hangout after finding out. Made no sense that she went back to work the next day. Clearly schools gonna be closed for a while.

I thought this gave a good look into her relationships with people. Ie there weren't any. So when she goes home to hangout it's because she really doesn't have anywhere else to go or people she's close with to be with. To me I got the impression she threw herself into her work because she gave up on having a life outside of it. This seems to be reinforced by her comment about communication not meaning you're good at relationships.

>Then the whole part about a group of military personnel going rogue because they listen to an Alex Jones the show.

It wasn't just that. They show the phone call with the guy's wife who's terrified and telling him their kid is asking if the aliens are going to kill them. There were a lot of motivations, and they were all powered by fear which is an incredibly persuasive emotion. It also mirrors the other countries reactions. Russia killing their interpreter, China declaring war on the aliens, etc.

de1euyo,"> the most nagging one is simply why all of that attention on the bird? The animal has zero to do with the plot yet is focused on several times throughout.

The canary was used to show that the air is safe to breathe. Like in a mine. It's why Amy Adams ultimately chose to take off her suit. 

> did Louise get affected by taking off her suit and passed on something to the kid?

No reason to think so. 

> We never find out who the aliens are, why they look like space squids, what they'll need from us in 3k years, or where they are from.

Not everything in life gets an answer. 

> The inability to hear the dialogue over random tech sounds or helicopters.

I saw it with subtitles but this is definitely an issue in movies. 

> How does the bomb smash through thr barrier and kill Costello?

It's a bomb and it breaks the barrier. 

> Why is the President never involved.

You think Trump would get within a mile of a landed UFO? 

> Why don't the aliens stay and teach us their advanced technology?

Giving humanity their gift of time viewing was all that humanity needs to move onto the next level in their eyes. 

> Why does Amy Adams constantly have to breathe heavily and keel over to display confusion & anxiety?

Just cuz. 

> How the woman is the only one who's shaking the whole time during 1sr contact?

The other men besides Jeremy Renner had presumably been in the room before. She was a linguist and wasn't ever envisioning or thinking about this scenario happening to her.

I didn't get the impression that they were low level, each seemed to be very experienced. And if an alien does come, it would probably be best to keep it a small group. That spaceship obvs has extremely advanced technology, and probably the weapons to match, it wouldn't be the best idea to rush at it with bombs and guns when we don't know what we're dealing with, wiser to do some probing first. China only went in after they thought that the aliens were a threat. And remember? The people back in White House/CIA headquarters told the commander (the one who got his cell phone used to call the Chinese) to prepare backup with troops in case of retaliation so safe to say that behind the investigation team there was a massive army ready to attack if needed.

Granted, I'm no military buff but it was hard to imagine they wouldn't have some bigger swinging dicks at that site instead of an army colonel and some troops.  

   
I don't think its standard for higher ups to go to places of war. The strategists and leaders historically have stayed at headquarters (more use there, less use if they get killed) while commanders are in the field. The President doesn't travel to Iraq for example, and CIA still decodes terrorists messages at a distance even though they weren't where the message were intercepted. ",5cc7fb

So she is able to use future information to affect the past.

The heptapod's positioning forced the world to take that first step towards working together and unite for the greater good. 

* Yes

* Can you alter your own future? Fine-tune the butterfly effect? That's a tough one. Louise saw what having a child would result in. But she did it anyway. However, what if she decided to not have the child, wouldn't her future show her that? My guess is that in this timeline for Louise, having the child despite the outcome was unavoidable. 

* They mention this in the movie how learning a language changes how you perceive the world. Look up the Sapir‚ÄìWhorf hypothesis. My guess is that they sporadically appear for Louise because she is just beginning to understand the language. Surely mastering the language would allow you to see your life's timeline similarly to a 5th dimensional being.

* This is where things got crazy. At this point he had read her book about The Universal Language. He understands that time is non-linear. He also knows that he must give her this information at some point so that she can use it to convince him to stop the attack in the past. I can only chalk this up to Louis somehow choosing a timeline where the attacks are stopped due to information from the heptapod that we'd still be around in 3000 years. Theres some more interesting explanations in this thread as well.",5cc7fb
d9zh1dr,"This is my understanding:

1. Anyone who learns their language can see their future. If they teach humans their language, humans will be able to see their future. Thus they may be able to prepare for the aliens' second arrival 3000 years from now, or they may be able to prepare their technology to help the aliens with whatever issue they have 3000 years from now, since they'll be able to know what exactly it is.

2. Yes, I think everyone who learns it will be able to see their future.

3. I think this is one of the main open-ended questions of the film. While Louise says that she chooses her future even though she knows how painful it will be, it is up to us to determine whether there is any free choice involved, or whether everything is predestined for us.

4. This is open to interpretation. In the film we see that Louise randomly starts seeing visions of her future. She passes them off as dreams. However by the end, she is able to see into the future that she needs to call the Chinese general Shang. I think it's up to us to decide whether that was her controlling what she saw, or whether it was just her randomly seeing important parts of her future.

5. I do agree, it seemed a bit forced and very coincidental. Although remember he said that he felt it was important that they meet in person, that he show her his private number, and that he said his wife's dying last words. I guess this also goes back to the question about whether we have free choice, or whether we are predestined to our own fate.",5cc7fb
da041o6,"You are misremembering the party scene a bit.  The general comes up and thanks her for already having changed his mind.  She had called him already, she just didn't remember doing it at that moment.  The general is a smart guy and knows how the language works (at this point in the future), so takes the opportunity to show her his phone number and give her the information.  He knows that this is the way she got the information in the first place and fulfills his part in stopping himself from doing something terrible in the past.

At no point do we see one future play out, then time travel to reset things.  There is no classical ""time travel"" in this movie, everything is happening at once to Louise.  In my opinion, she couldn't change events anymore than you could change a painting from a landscape to a bowl of fruit by staring at the finished piece.",5cc7fb
da04equ,">This would in turn change the future we are seeing into a now alternate future

I think this is where your theory falls apart.  The movie doesn't really show any evidence of alternate timelines... it actually does the opposite.  The aliens let their ship be bombed, Louise goes through with having the baby and losing Ian, etc.  it's a pretty deterministic universe.  She's able to change the general's mind because she has always changed his mind; there was never an original timeline where she didn't have that ability yet because once she achieves understanding of the alien language she the gains that ability across her entire life.  Essentially, once she has that power then she has ALWAYS had that power.",5cc7fb

The start and end of the movie are actually after the hectapods left, in ""present day"". The time the hectapods were on earth was the past, and her visions were of the future.

The entire time the aliens are on earth is essentially a flashback, and we catch up to present day shortly after they depart.

Yes.  This is confirmed in what appears to be a throw away line in the film about the [Sapir-Whorf hypothesis](http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/sociology-general-terms-and-concepts/theory) in a conversation between Ian and Louise when he asks if shes dreaming in their language.

>Sapir-Whorf hypothesis This hypothesis‚Äîa position of linguistic relativity‚Äîargues that (to quote one of its authors) language ‚Äòis not merely a reproducing instrument for voicing ideas, but is itself a shaper of ideas, the programme and guide for the individual's meaningful activity‚Äô. In short, language determines (or shapes) our perceptions of reality.

There's also montage voice over by Ian earlier in the films that says as follows: -

>We have our friends in Pakistan to thank for their study of how Heptapods write. Because unlike speech, a Logogram is free of time.  Like their ship or their bodies, their written language as no forward or backward direction.  Linguists call this nonlinear orthography which raises the question - is this how they think?

Those lines basically tell the audience that the aliens perceive time differently to us, and that an understanding of their language will begin to affect the way a person perceives reality. In this case, time itself.",5cc7fb

I thought a lot about her choice to have the baby despite what she would know about the child's future.  I struggled with it until I realized I was thinking about the choice ""linearly.""

If I told you in this moment that the child you would have next year would die young of a rare cancer, would you choose to have the baby?  There's a good chance you would not.

If you had the joy of living with a child you loved for a decade and a half, and then had the option to say, ""I wish this child never existed,"" would you make that choice?  I very much doubt it.

You could argue that the child would be put through undue suffering, but I don't think that's the case.  I think to live is to go through a lot of suffering.  Understanding your life's worth of time at once would be enlightening in that regard. ",5cc7fb
dbc0jwv,"Some answers:

* The bird - Have you ever heard the phrase ""Canary in a coal mine?"" The origin of it is that coal miners would take canaries and other birds down into the mine shaft with them. Since there was a risk of dangerous gases and other elements that could be harmful, miners knew that if the canary died, it was a warning to escape immediately. The bird in Arrival served a similar purpose and it's why Louise knew she could take her Hazmat suit off. The bird was able to survive in the ship's atmosphere, so Louise knew she could do the same.

* You said that you had a problem with the family plot because time is linear. What the heptapods teach Louise, though, is that time is NOT linear. It's a concept that science-fiction has revisited throughout history. Kurt Vonnegut's Tralfamadorians in Slaughterhouse-Five do not perceive time as being linear; the past, present and future occur all at the same time. The heptapods have a similar approach.

* As for the question as to why a person would choose to live through a tragedy like losing a child even when they know the outcome, it really centers around free will. We normally perceive free will as the decision to act, to change something or choose a particular path. The film is arguing that sometimes the choice is not to act, to allow something preordained to happen as previously determined. That's especially true when you insert the concept of non-linear time. If no one ever truly dies, if the past, present and future are occurring all at the same time, then that can mitigate the pain of the death of a loved one. So while Louise knows Hannah will die, she also knows Hannah will always be alive thanks to non-linear time. And a life with Hannah even for a little bit is better than life without her at all.",5cc7fb
dbeurx9,"The entire point of her time traveling is that she wasn't going to change the future (not have a daughter). Why she went through with it is a redundant discussion of hypothical morals of movie characters. 

Time isn't linear,  this precisely why you seem to angry about everything. There is no butterfly effects. What Louise can do seems to be more of the realm of peering into possible futures and manipulating them like a dream which is how the Chinese leader scene happen and why she wakes up from most of the future scenes.

As for the couple thing. It seemed clear to me that the chemistry would have continued to grow, but the guy confessed his feelings and she already knew they would get married so why play hard to get.

So the story telling of the movie, then, is non linear, in that it begins with moments that happen after the movie's story arc. The daughter was always going to die, the call was always going to be made, and in this sense it makes me wonder what was the point of it all... Why do we care about her personal story when the big question is this: Why the hell did the aliens want to give this ""gift""? It seems that her ability to use this future sight and communicate with the Chinese government was only really necessary to quell the problem that the aliens brought in arriving to earth. The scene that says ""we will need you in 3000 years"" is the only thing they give us. So are we to assume that giving the human race a way to look into the future through the adoption of this language is the gift that... does what? Fixes mankind's problems? Because how can we have any problems if we always know what will happen in the future? And if this is not the case... and you still have free will with the ability to see the future (which really doesn't make sense... because if you can change the future you have seen than the future you have seen was never really the future at all) then what the fuck is the gift the aliens are giving and what is the point of it and how have they ""helped"" and how will this help the aliens in 3000 years?

I literally just walked out of the movie less than 20 minutes ago and I felt I needed to go to the internet for answers. I was hoping for some answer on the bird, but still am left wondering what the significance was? All I can think of is to place a connection to the childs drawing seen earlier in the film. If that is the only reason, it stinks. 

I also don't understand the climax really. Can Louise see the future? If so, that's almost as science fictiony as the plot of aliens arriving. It just seems cheap and simple. How/why can she see the future? I am left with more questions than answers. 

I think you raise a good point with Jeremy Renner's character and the child as well. I assume the child is born AFTER they see the aliens and meet. Therefore little should be weird to them. I find it odd none of this is mentioned during their relationship that she solved the whole Alien thing with her ability to see the future and future with him and their daughter.

Besides, in every sci-fi movie or time travel movie, one thing always occur. You can NEVER mess with the future, cause when you think you are changing it, you will be eventually set the course which leads to that future anyways. You know, we're seen that plenty of time.

[In our world we see time as linear. As Louise says at the start, everything has a beginning a middle and and end, so yes, in our world, the above scenario would be a paradox because there is no way Shang can give her all the info to prevent the attack without altering the timeline to the point where she never received the information. However, as we learn throughout the movie the UL allows humans to see time as the aliens do - non linear. This is important because only in a linear timeline would this paradox exist. If time was non linear and the past, present, future were all happening at the same time then it becomes easier. The future is not changed because it's happening at the same time Louise needs to find the number in the present. Imagine it this way: Louise is in two places at once, the site and the dinner in the ""future"" except she's sharing a mind.

Imagine the Heptapods foresee their destruction in 3000 years. However because they are limited to thinking about events along a radial time, there is no way to avoid the catastrophe. So they identify a species, humans, that exhibit a different way of thinking about cause and effect than they do.

This could be explained by heptapods observing humans take the least pragmatic path again and again. Imagine one heptpoda saying to another 'why do they keep doing X when it is obvious that it leads to a bad end??'. Obvious from a perspective that experiences or conceives of time differently. This human behavior is documented in psychological theories such as Prospect Theory* and discounted future cost / rewards.  This behavior would suggest some cultural means that is as un-relatable as radial time is to us.  

So they see us as a way to 'gift' them a sense of determinism.

The reason General Shang told Louise his private number and his wife's dying words in the future is because he knew she would need that information in the present, evidenced by him saying during the future conversation ""I do not claim to know how your mind works, but I feel it is important for you to see this"" then he gives her his private number and wife's dying words. So with that statement we can confirm 3 things:

1. He has not learned the language during the 18 months of time that took place between the phone conversation and the future conversation, proving that he doesn't have the same ability as Louise.


2. He knows about Louise's ability to experience time in a non-linear fashion.


3. He knows the role he has to play in Louise's time ""loop"".

As to your second point, yes, Louise can teach humanity the language. She's not the ""chosen one"" or whatever, she was just the person that got picked for the job and had the proper knowledge to understand the heptapods. It could have easily been the other linguist in Berkeley had he not failed Colonel Weber's test that was given to him by Louise. So she ends up being the one who writes the book and there was also a scene of her teaching it in a lecture hall. She is not going to live 3000 years; rather, the information that she can pass on during her lifetime will be passed on and on through generations of humanity, where eventually in 3000 years the heptapods will return for humanity's help. What exactly that ""help"" could possibly entail nobody knows (I read a theory by someone else where they said that the heptapods would need to learn a linear form of thought, which the humans have and they do not--pretty interesting to think about). Humanity would not have learned this language without the Arrival since every single language and form of thought we have is based around linearity.

As to why Ian doesn't learn the language, it's likely because he either refused or for some reason or another was incapable of doing so. My outlandish theory is that Louise doesn't write the book until *after* the death of her daughter. So she selfishly held the knowledge of nonlinearity to herself because she cherished the memories of her daughter so much that she didn't want them to be taken away by Ian or anyone else. I guess Ian could still alter the past regardless of when he learns the language, I don't know. Anyways, just my thoughts.",5cc7fb

They explained learning a new language rewires the brain. It's a real concept. Learning the heptapod language allows you to see the past present and future as one. It's not a special ability but rather a way of thinking.

That's really irrelevant to the theme. Language will evolve, and will likely be mutually incomprehensible in 3000 years.

Two people could argue whether or not she made the right choice, and that's even more reason for him to have felt betrayed; she knew it was going to happen but never offered him the choice of being a part of it.

When Louise has that encounter at the glass where she's able to form the symbols by touching it, it really seems like she's having some kind of higher experience.

Your second question is answered in the movie, they never say it's cancer. Louise tells her daughter it's a ""rare disease"" so you can assume it's incurable. It's also possible that the girl got the disease from both her parents being openly exposed on the ship which is why it's incurable but that's more of a theory i have and it doesn't 100% fit anyway (Why wouldn't Louise and Ian develop the disease as well?). Louise also asks Ian towards the end that if he could see his entire life in front of him would he try and change anything and he just says he'd say how he feels more often.

Another important factor to my understanding is that you cannot change any part of time you have to live it how it was. (Although Louise sort of did saw her future to act in her present which doesn't mean she changed anything it was just meant to happen that way)",5cc7fb

d9vk45j,"On your first question, the flashbacks are flash forwards. In other words, the timeline of the aliens arriving and her work with them is in present tense and the flashbacks are in future tense. The ability to see time as nonlinear is the gift they give us. It's actually the plot of the movie and the short story it's based on, which goes even deeper into the philosophy of knowing the future and free will. 

The scene at the ball isn't in the short story and was a nice addition because it helped resolve the whole ""they're here to help us because we'll help them one day"" thing that also wasn't in the original text. The scene shows us that their gift is their language, which we'll use to see the future and be less conflicted with one another ‚Äî something that'd help us survive the thousands of year and save their species.

He decided to do that on their first occasion of meeting in person. 

He could have easily waited 20 years and told her when they were both older... but the point is that he knew he had to tell her that information so she could know it in the past.

She knew it would bring peace because she had already experienced that peace.

The whole point is that she began to see her life non-linearly, and that's how the movie is shot. I think trying to hold the movie's storytelling to a strict ""this is a flash back or flash forward"" is missing the point that there IS NO ""forward"" or ""backward"" because it all is happening at the same ""time"". While the movie lets us look at a small snapshot that we label the ""present"", there is no ""present"" in the reality of the story.

Her having agency at the event can easily be explained by her being super new to her ""powers"" and not being used to jumping into the moment she is experiencing, or added with the stress of getting chased / committing treason / etc.

Louise could see the future: that she would write that book, and the world would work together and understand the language. But just seeing that this was the case wasn't enough, she needed to do something to impact that and make it happen (getting the phone number and communicating with the Chinese general).

Now go to the alien's predicament, they too have seen the future, but they need to do something to make that reality true.

d9vz3qi,They were learning it just as the humans were learning heptapod. Amy Adam's would write an English word and they would write the heptapod word. It was a two way learning process.

But even for Louise, becoming ""fluent"" in heptapod later on enabled her to read it in the past (""I can read this [crazy jumble of heptapod writing]"") in a weird feedback loop. 

So yeah, I think maybe the heptapods were quick learners in the first place, but also the fact that they eventually learned it at some point in our linear view means that they would had access to that fluency (in the sense that they could understand when Louise spoke in English, but lack the organs to generate audible English speech in return) in the linear past as well.

On top of that, even if it was a conscious decision, she felt all the love and joy her daughter provided for her. I think she would want that again. It's like having a loved family member die, you'd want them back if possible. Even if it meant they had to pass away again.

2. I interpreted the ""bad decision"" as Dr. Banks' decision to give birth to a child she knew would die a painful‚Äîfor both the child and parents‚Äîdeath. Depending on how much you cherish life that is a non-zero-sum game. Just because we humans die doesn't mean we cannot gain some benefit from our lives and the lives of others. I saw that decision as a very strong one. To run away from pain is to admit one's weakness. To embrace it, grow, and learn from it, is to gain strength.

The U.S. government did not plant the bomb. Rogue soldiers planted the bomb. After thinking about this more, I found this plot point somewhat odd. The soldiers had literally spent months watching the aliens. At no point did the aliens exhibit any hostility.

d9xczsr,"Another take on significance of number 12 comes from biblical perspective. Especially the occurrence of #12 in Book of Revelations which tells about the end times. 'Perfect governmental foundation' 

 From Biblestudy.org

Twelve can be found in 187 places in God's word. Revelation alone has 22 occurrences of the number. The meaning of 12, which is considered a perfect number, is that it symbolizes God's power and authority, as well as serving as a perfect governmental foundation. It can also symbolize completeness or the nation of Israel as a whole. For example, Jacob (Israel) had twelve sons, each of which represented a tribe begun by a prince, for 12 princes total. Ishmael, who was born to Abraham through Hagar, also had twelve princes.

God specified that twelve unleavened cakes of bread be placed every week in the temple with frankincense next to each of the two piles that were to be made. The priests were commanded to change the bread every Sabbath day (Leviticus 24).

Christ called and choose twelve men to bear witness to what he did and to spread the good news of the gospel to the entire world. After he was raised from the dead, Jesus told the eleven disciples (Judas had killed himself) that God had given him ALL power and authority in both earth and heaven (God's divine authority - Matthew 28:18).

Twelve thousand from each tribe of Israel (144,000 total) will receive salvation during the end time's Great Tribulation (Revelation 7). A set of 144,000 (12 x 12,000), possibly the same as those in chapter 7, will be taken from earth in order to serve and follow the Lamb of God (Revelation 14:1 - 5). Christ's bride in Revelation 12, the church, wears a crown containing twelve stars.

New Jerusalem, which is made in heaven and brought to the earth by God himself, contains 12 gates made of pearl which are each manned by an angel. Over each gate will be one of the names of Israel's twelve tribes. The walls are 144 cubits high (12 multiplied by itself - Revelation 21:16 - 17), with the city itself being 12,000 furlongs square.",5cc7fb

___    

    MALE VOICE: Hello Louise.

    LOUISE: Costello? Is that you?

Her words are converted into the hushed, waterfall sounds and organic clicks of the heptapod language in real time.

Costello waves.

     LOUISE: What is this place?

Costello speaks. The translator speaks.

     MALE VOICE: Place for Abbott.

Louise looks again at the tube.

Abbott does not move. He's missing arms. His body looks wrong. Darker in places. Sunken in.

    LOUISE: Is Abbott okay?

Gurgle-click-whisper

    MALE VOICE: Abbott is dead.

Louise is hit hard by this. She forces herself to look away.

    LOUISE: I'm so sorry...

Costello whispers.

    MALE VOICE: Abbott is a sign. Abbott has learned from 
                Louise what all heptapods must learn.

    LOUISE: I don't understand.

The lighting in the room shifts. The circular walls now reveal an elaborate series of logograms written densely, in a long chain, all the way around the room.

It's like a giant ring, with an niscription etched on the inside.

    MALE VOICE: This is the story of our people. From 
               origin to death. A span of two point nine 
               billion human years.

Louise marvels at it. Steps closer.

What she thought were solid lines creating the interconnected logograms are actually SMALLER logograms themselves.

    LOUISE: It's beautiful... How do you know the future?

    MALE VOICE: All of the moments in our life are like 
               memories. We do not perceive time as humans do.

Louise follow the phrasing to the end.

    LOUISE: Where are you right now?

Costello raises one of his arms and points.

A sliver of light cuts vertically across the logogram--

Almost at the very end of the phrase.

    MALE VOICE: The end for heptapods is coming. 
               This is why we are here. To learn from you.
               And to help you.

    LOUISE: Learn from us? Learn what?

Costello turns and looks back at Abbott's body.

    MALE VOICE: Power to choose. Not to follow the path 
               of our story. To break from what we know is to 
               come, and choose the unknown instead. That 
               is the only way for us to survive now.

    LOUISE: Was Abbott supposed to die in the explosion?
               Was that his story?

Costello stares at Abbott a beat. As if in wonder.

    MALE VOICE: No. Abbott chose a different path. He
               broke his future. And by his death, he has 
               shown that all heptapods are free.

Costello turns his attention back to her. Whisper-click.

    MALE VOICE: You are the key. You choose life. Even 
               knowing what the future holds. You light the 
               way for us all.",5cc7fb
d9xuuhz,"If you can see the future, presumably you can change it in this universe.

d9y4aop,"Ok, so:

-Throughout most of the movie, you're led to believe that the scenes with her daughter are flashbacks, and Louise seems sick/weird because she's having bad memories of her dead daughter. However, when she is in the white room on the other side of the glass, talking to one of the aliens, she sees a ""flashback"" of her daughter, and asks who the little girl is. At this point, you realize the flashbacks are not flashbacks at all,  is seeing the future.

 -The language is the weapon in that it is not limited by time - fully understanding the language allows one to see the past, present, and future of their life, and this is what happens to Louise. The alien tells her that the reason they came to Earth was to teach the language to her so she could bring the world together (you see this through her in the present ""remembering"" a conversation with the Chinese leader from the future, and this allows her to stop war with the aliens). They need the humans to understand time and this language because in 3000 years, they will need humanity's help (Specifically why they need help is not told to us.)

-Back to the daughter, by piecing together the various flash-forwards from throughout the movie, we realize that Ian and Louis's get married and the daughter who dies of cancer is their daughter. Ian leaves Louise because she said yes to ""do you wanna make a baby?"", fully knowing the fact that their daughter would die in the future.

At the same time, while she does perceive time in a new way, I don't know that she perceives everything in a way that we would think of as ""simultaneous""...her breadth of understanding is widened but the scope of her perception remains limited in some respects. Also, remember that for the heptapods, language is entirely performative; necessary for communication but always known across time. It makes sense that it works the same for Louise.

Yes it is implied that Louise endeavors to teach the heptapod language so that humanity can not only improve its condition exponentially but also prepare for the day when the heptapods needs humanity's assistance.",5cc7fb

da6dqik,"> 1)If Louise received the ability to perceive time in a non linear fashion due to learning the hectapods language, why did we see flashforwards at the start of the movie before she ever came into contact with them? Was this just for the viewers?

SPOILERS:

The start and end of the movie are actually after the hectapods left, in ""present day"". The time the hectapods were on earth was the past, and her visions were of the future.

So the timeline goes: aliens arrive, Louise sees visions of Hannah and Ian in the future, aliens depart, Louise and Ian get together, Hannah is born (or possibly just conceived), Louise narrates the beginning and ending of the movie, Ian leaves Louise and Hannah, Hannah dies. 

The entire time the aliens are on earth is essentially a flashback, and we catch up to present day shortly after they depart.

The book (that the movie is based on) is actually written in present tense for the beginning and ending, in past tense while the aliens are on earth, and in future tense for Louise's visions.",5cc7fb
da6q21m,"1) Louise with baby Hannah is present day. Disease and Hannah's death are in the future, Hectapods are in the past. Having all of those timelines overlapping and/or out of order helps illustrate the concept of non-linear time. Louise keeps having these visions of Hannah throughout the movie because she's learning the language and, therefore, beginning to perceive time differently. We only learn near the end that she has had no idea what any of it was. 

2) There's no real answer to that, since we *do* perceive time linearly. The conceit of the film appears to be that we live our lives as normal, but have memories of the past and ""memories"" of the future. Since it's such an impossible concept to understand, this ""future memory"" business is an easy way for us to wrap our heads around it.

3) My interpretation was that Louise was correct when she theorized that the information was split up so as to force humanity to work together. The relationships formed during this information exchange will lead to the advancement required to help the Hectapods later. ",5cc7fb
da5u0m8,"I think you're still looking at it in a linear way, everything is happening at the same time, from her daughter being born, to her daughter dying, to her first kiss with her husband, to meeting him for the first time.

da79zok,"SPOILERS:

The wall of text had the symbol for ""time"" repeated in several places but they couldn't make out what it all meant. Ian realized that if he looked at the symbols in a 3D space, the symbols took up 1/12th of the whole volume, and he deduced that they needed the same type of info from the other 11 shells to make sense of it all. 

I'm not sure how he got the symbols into a 3D space, or what was learned when they got the info from the other 11 shells but I think the idea was that it was the breakthrough they needed in order to understand whatever the heptapods wanted them to know.

Louise's ability to see visions of the future, however, was independent of that, since she was having them already, as she learned more and more about the language. Costello told her to use her ability to see into the future, and that's when she saw the vision of the general and then called him, leading to the Chinese backing down and getting all of the other countries to share their information. That presumably completed the 12 pieces of the puzzle, making whatever breakthrough was necessary so the heptapods felt that their mission was done. Louise wasn't the breakthrough, she was just the one that was able to use the gift to get all the countries to cooperate and share the information.

The introduction of the film was placed there more so for emotional means, you have to remember, just because something is shown first, does not mean it occurred first. Not every film is structured chronologically. In short, any scene you saw with her daughter in it does not exist, yet...

And Louise learning the language allowed her to glance through time, but she doesn't know exactly what happens until she experiences through her time travel experiences thus why she seemed lost when she met the general.

I really do wish they had more on the communication part as well though. It would have been cool to see the two species communicating with each other.

I'm glad you felt the circular language held *some* meaning then!
  
Seriously though, I take your point; it's hard to wrap your head around. But it's also fair to say that you and I both think and dream in our respective native languages, correct? But even more then that, language arguably shapes the way we perceive and process information.
  
In mine for example, I write from left to right, one word after the other. My language forces me to chronologically segment everything using multiple words, describing one thing at a time. I simply have no way to express a sequential experience using just one word, like the Heptapods can. I must use many.
  
Similarly, when recalling a sequence of events, I tend to visualise them one after the other, as it might feel unnatural or unproductive to think about them all at once. 
  
Therefore my language preconditions me to expect **a** followed by **b**, rather than **b** followed by **a** or even **ab** all at the same time. It's pertinent to think that just because this is my norm, doesn't make it the norm for the universe.
  
So, events unravel in my mind in much the same way as sequential words do on a page. There's no large cerebral disjuncture between reading, watching or imagining something from a chronological standpoint. My world is simply digested as a line heading from **a** to **b**.
  
With that said, what if your language preconditioned you to think about cause and effect simultaneously? Where rational thought meant  **a** and **b** ceased to be apart, not neccesarily because you learned how to think this way, but maybe because you knew no different and your neurology was highly adapted to this way of being.
  
What if every time you made a plan to do something, you somehow automatically knew the outcome, as if the two thoughts were born together, inseperable. Wouldn't that be cool? Your dependency upon time itself would be rewritten, potentially even becoming irrelevant.  
  
To get from **a** to **b** is chronologically measurable, and we often take that for granted. But when both **a** and **b** become unified, getting from **ab** to *nowhere* is not so measurable because now we have *nowhere* to measure to.
  
Time here becomes fluid, as the essence of our capacity to meaningfully measure it evaporates like the last whisp of oil in a searing pan. With **a** and **b** occupying the same frame, it's akin to the two ends of our traditional, chronological line being brought together, overlapping, turning the line into a circle.
  
Who's to say then that this is all so weird? Especially as you already appreciate that time itself can be pretty strange, as depicted by Interstellar.",5cc7fb

d9wsphk,"Ian and she have a conversation near the beginning of the film. He says that he's read that the language you speak can actually influence the way you think. Grammar and syntax have a sense of time and order. This is expanded upon as Louise learns the alien language. Their language is not linear like our sentences are - it is cyclical, a circle with no start or finish. As she learns this language, she begins to perceive time in the same way. When she says she knows why her husband left her shes becoming aware of all the things that happen to her - past, present, and future all happening at once.

All the times you think she's having flashbacks, she's actually seeing what we would perceive as the future. In her future, after the aliens leave, she has her daughter, Hannah with Ian. Hannah grows to a young age and eventually dies of cancer. However, when she hugs Ian in the final scene, she knows that all of this will happen. She chooses to have Hannah even when she knows Hannah will later die. This is why Ian leaves her - he thinks she made the wrong choice in having a child she knew would reach an untimely end. 

As for the conversation with the Chinese general - when she makes the decision to call him, she is experiencing meeting him at the gala/event simultaneously. As she experiences both things at the same time, the version of herself in the military compound is able to repeat to that time's version of the Chinese general what the FUTURE version of the General is telling the future version of her (read that a few times haha). The content of that message is his wife's dying words - something she could only know if she was time-omniscient.

First off, they are from a different world. It is highly possible that their world is chemically composed of completely different elements than on earth. And we currently have NOT discovered every element in the universe, as you seem to think. 

There are few plot holes, but not many as you seem to not understand.

The aliens could've used an old dialect of some language, or maybe she could more easily identify the tone of their language. They just want as much information as soon as possible and the first thing you do is let your language experts listen to it.

Secondly there was actually a lot of commotion when she took of her suit, but what can they do at that point? She made a lot of progress and they determined that the progress was worth the risk. 

Also on your point of Ian not doing much: In the movie they explained that working out their language is priority number one. They need to be able to interpreter any communication from the aliens and see how they think. That's why they only worked on the language at first.   ",5cc7fb

When Louise experiences her flash-forward and sees this pic, she realizes she is in the past, relative to the drawn pic. This reaffirms for Louise that she is seeing in the future and not just going insane or whatever. 
Also, the daughter brings up the concept of zero-sum game, which Louise utilizes from a flash forward.

Pretend you are in the same rooms as the characters and that you're experiencing the events unfold with them at the same time. Immerse yourself in this world that the director painted. If you allow yourself to do that then you'll feel petrified at the first encounters with the aliens, emotional during the first mother-daughter scenes, and astonished during the revelations of those mind-boggling concepts and ideas. The music was so on point that it invoked your emotions tenfold, the cinematography granted my the eyes the privilege of seeing vibrant colors and perspectives/shots I wouldn't normally see, but the storytelling presented these accounts in such a way that kept suspense building and building until the climax where things not only started to make sense but begun to blow your mind.

The point of the story was to explore the idea of what would happen if aliens arrived with no immediate way to communicate. Is it unlikely that would happen? Yes. It's also unlikely that aliens would ever chose to interact with us in the first place.

Directors love to play with time in movies (it is one of the only artistic mediums where time is played with so fluidly). So by having the film start out of sequence yet we the audience are still able to understand it speaks to how there is the possibility that we humans can totally process events non-linearly. The power of film shows this and it is no big deal. Look at films like Memento or Pulp Fiction. Film makers love to do this stuff to our heads.",5cc7fb

[Also, would this mean everyone who reads her book and learns the language has this ability? Logically it would and what does that mean in a world where you can 'see' your death? Does anyone get on MH 370? Wouldn't this be the most important language for someone to learn since it literally saves your life?

I don't think a 'twist' was necessary so I really think the movie should have started in the classroom. Of course, I'd have to go back in time and see a version edited that way to know if that would create problems of its own.

2) I don't know, I would venture to say that once you gain the ability to experience time non-linearly, you also gain the ability to navigate it, just as we navigate our way about the world with our current perception of three dimensions. Maybe think of a day just as you think of our physical movement through space. You aren't forced to move in a straight line or 'linearly through space' when you learn how to walk or better yet crawl, presumably just as you wouldn't be forced to experience all of your life's time at once when you learn to perceive it non-linearly.

das08y3,"Technically I should've said that it spans ""dimensions 3D and up"".  
So calculus is the mathematical study of change. Let's say that you throw a ball from point A (where you are) to point B (where it lands). If you want to calculate it linearly, you would calculate the linear distance from A to B (position of B minus position of A). This is a 2d plane because you are only looking at a x-y axis (flat plane).  
Now let's go 3D, x-y-z. Going by the throwing the ball example, now you're looking at the arc (flat surface + air above.....ie how high it goes + distance). You get the arc of the ball with the factors of velocity and time. These factors will rate of change as the ball goes up and falls. Calculus is the study of change.    
Going a tiny bit further, you have matrixes, inverses, invisible numbers (mind blast), etc. that use numbers that are not on a 2D plane or in a 3D dimension (I can give specific examples but I don't know how far along in mathematical study you are to understand).

She didn't have a choice. 

I haven't seen the movie yet but I read the story its based on a while ago, so I don't know if this part is the same: In the book when asked why they were on Earth, the Heptapods would only say ""To see"" or ""To observe"". The point there is, they're just going through the motions and observing something that they know will happen, it has to happen. They see that moment and all other moments in their lives as a whole.

She can't make that choice. There is no choice to make. To imply the concept of a choice is to ignore the fact that she no longer thinks of time in a linear fashion.",5cc7fb

The Book of Ages was used as an example; the Book of Ages has the story of everything written in it, even the future.

It is certainly tragic but it is only fucked up if you just think of her daughters birth as a death sentence.                 

As for your second point. You have to remember that in the end this was Louise's story. Ian was a part of that story so we don't know what state the marriage was at the time she told him. We don't know that he wishes that he had never had a child if she was going to die. We only see flashes from Louise's perspective.

No matter what anyone who has a child is making the choice to bring a being into this world who will without a doubt die. I don't find her to be selfish because this is a decision people make everyday. The only difference is she knows that she knows how the child will die. Nothing is guaranteed your child could unfortunately die early or live to a ripe old age but it is no surprise that they will die.

You could argue that the Louise brought suffering to Hannah she could of avoided but many people go through lots of suffering in this world and we know that when they are born we just hope it doesn't happen to our kids but the odds are that it will.

""The heptapods are neither free nor bound as we understand those concepts; they don't act according to their will, nor are they helpless automatons. What distinguishes the heptapods' mode of awareness is not just that their actions coincide with history's events; it is also that their motives coincide with history's purposes. They act to create the future, to enact chronology.
Freedom isn't an illusion; it's perfectly real in the context of sequential consciousness. Within the context of simultaneous consciousness, freedom is not meaningful, but neither is coercion; it's simply a different context, no more or less valid than the other. It's like that famous optical illusion, the drawing of either an elegant young woman, face turned away from the viewer, or a wart-nosed crone, chin tucked down on her chest. There's no ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù interpretation; both are equally valid. But you can't see both at the same time.
Similarly, knowledge of the future was incompatible with free will. What made it possible for me to exercise freedom of choice also made it impossible for me to know the future. Conversely, now that I know the future, I would never act contrary to that future, including telling others what I know: those who know the future don't talk about it. Those who've read the Book of Ages never admit to it.""

d9zlte5,"There are two things at play here:

- determinism (free-will)
- causal loops (or predestination)

The second one is less interesting because it's overdone in movies -- it's the idea that the once you have an interaction between the future and the past, this interaction is always bound to happen. There is plenty of discussion on this on scifi and time-travel sites. It's honestly gotten to a point where it's boring.

On the other hand, the determinism and free-will is an interesting one and hasn't been explored much in film. In philosophy, there are roughly 3 camps when it comes to the question of free-will. Determinism, libertarian, and compatibilism. In determinism the universe is a closed system that resembles a machine, at any given time and configuration of quarks in the universe there is one and only one way the universe can progress from there. Kind of like a tick of a watch. If you rewind the machine to that time and configuration then it will continue on ticking in the same way it did the first time. On this view humans are merely blobs of quarks that play there part in the predetermined universe. 

In my opinion this film was trying to play with the idea of free will more than it was interested in time-travel-type scenarios -- which is what makes it interesting!!",5cc7fb

Seeing the future and changing the future are two totally different things. There could be a voice inside her for the rest of her life that's screaming, trying to do things differently, but ultimately condemned to witness events play out as they have been foretold. 

As for your comment on Ian's last few lines, keep in mind that all we've seen him do up to that point in the movie is be a scientist and a coworker to Louise. We have no idea how he behaves as a suitor, and him being awkward and cheesy might just be his way. ",5cc7fb

I think you're right in that it should have been a decision she shared with her husband, but then you get into the whole cause and effect thing - there's no point questioning that, because she's seen the future, she knows it happens.

d9xs16s,"I disagree. The minute it was totally confirmed I was like, ""oh... okay..."" -- I'd picked up on it earlier and was actually hoping they wouldn't do it. I was hoping they wouldn't do it because in the beginning of the film I read a lot into Amy's character: she was a depressed, lonely, mourning parent in stasis; burying herself in her work & willfully ignoring that the world was still spinning (and aliens had landed) because her daughter was dead and for all intents and purposes, she *wants* the world to stop spinning because her daughter's no longer in it. Additionally, she was fearless compared to any/all other linguists in meeting & communicating with the aliens because she felt like she had nothing left to lose.

All of that was dashed to hell when the twist happened... and we have absolutely no idea why Amy's character was so friggin dismal to begin with in the beginning of the movie.

Not to mention the directing/writing broke its code re: film mechanism/device. Those flashes in the beginning were *not* representing anything Amy was experiencing/seeing in real time, but then later in the film, those same flashes (in style & cinematography) represented things Amy *was* experiencing/seeing in real time. The film broke code on their 'flash' device *simply* to fool the audience. It was pretty cheap. If you want a good twist, don't deliberately fool the audience with breaking the code of a device. The best twists out there are when there's no deliberate fooling & it's just a re-frame of what you've been watching in all fairness -- The Usual Suspects & Fight Club come to mind. Edit: Primal Fear as well, actually. Edward Norton has chosen some great fair-play twist films. And also The Sixth Sense was a terrible 'twist' film because upon rewatch nothing holds up: the natural offscreen endings of tons of scenes would've timed the twist/revelation way *way* earlier.

One last edit: It'd be like if I handed you a deck of cards and asked ""is that a deck of cards?"" and you go ""yeah"" and then I replaced it with another deck of cards that look exactly the same and said, ""is that a deck of cards?"" and you go ""yeah"" and I replied ""HAH!

d9x1o6v,"It's a tricky one!

I think the best way of conceptualizing compatibilism as an alternative is by acknowledging different definitions of ‚Äòfree will‚Äô. There is the robust, metaphysical kind of free will that [libertarian‚Äôs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism_(metaphysics\)) defend, and there is the kind of free will compatiblists defend which is functional and ethical in character.

Historically, free will has almost always been contrasted with determinism (as in ‚Äòfree will *and* determinism‚Äô: Either one or the other) and yet just because free will‚Äîas a quirk of the history of philosophy‚Äîhas always been construed this way, it does not follow that this is the only way, or even the best way of construing it. This way is perfectly coherent and everyone seems to understand it perfectly well, and today there are hardly any libertarians given the arguments presented by those who embrace determinism.

So compatibilists completely agree with hard determinists that this kind of metaphysical, libertarian free will cannot be had, yet they stress that there is another, perfectly coherent version of free will on offer, which is immune to determinism. Just as science has informed us that tables and chairs are really nothing but atoms on a more fundamental level, we still believe that the categories of ‚Äòtable‚Äô and ‚Äòchair‚Äô are coherent; they are merely functional definitions we‚Äôve employed to make sense of objects in the macroscopic world. The same goes for more scientific terms like ‚Äòspecies‚Äô and ‚Äòplanet‚Äô. When we deploy these terms we are somewhat arbitrarily carving up the world, but at the same time, the definitions are functional because species and planets do things that are interesting and relevant to us. So we‚Äôre picking out real differences, not just imaginary ones. Species produce offspring that resembles them, planets orbit stars. 

Free will then refers to a cognitive phenomenon enjoyed by only a small subset of organisms. Free actions are those that are consistent with our beliefs and desires. I was a big fan of Arrival, and I chose to see it (because I believed I would probably enjoy it and I had a desire to watch it). If instead I was coerced at gunpoint to go see Bridget Jones‚Äôs Baby, I would not be acting freely, because seeing the movie would not be consistent with my desire to see it. Sure I am still choosing to see the movie in some limited sense, because I do not want to get shot, but it seems meaningful to contrast this instance of coercion with the case in which I see Arrival instead, because my action better aligns with what I really desire. Rocks, desktop computers, and some humans (those who have a mental handicap, for example) cannot perform these actions and so don‚Äôt have free will. 

So ultimately, compatibilists argue for a definition of free will that does some explanatory work. The hard determinist may think that humans and rocks are pretty much the same, because the rock cannot choose to do anything and neither can the human; they are both just acting in accordance with the laws of physics. But the compatibilist accepts that while both are ultimately determined, they have different kinds of abilities as a matter of description, and this is what makes humans unique.

A lot of the arguments between hard determinists and compatibilists tend to [equivocate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation) ‚Äòfree will‚Äô so that each side argues past one another by inadvertently switching between different types of free will during an exchange. The first thing that needs to take place in any debate like this is definition of terms, and this is where I think the debate actually needs to happen. There needs to be debate about which definition of ‚Äòfree will‚Äô is best to use from the start.

The best argument for accepting compatibilist‚Äôs definition of free will over libertarian‚Äôs is that the compatibilist definition allows for moral responsibility and the legal ramifications that result. If someone commits a crime and they are completely lucid, not coerced, and they act according to their beliefs and desires, they have committed a crime freely and the severity of the punishment will reflect this. Those who have less freedom (in the compatibilist‚Äôs sense) will be treated with leniency. For example, those under a certain age, those coerced to commit a crime, and those with some kind of mental disability. Secondly the compatibilist definition actually refers, while the libertarian one does not, so by using the compatibilist definition of free will, we are being pragmatic by accepting a definition that applies to real world cases, relevant to human affairs, and not just to some non-existent ability that could never exist at our world.",5cc7fb
d9x1wls,"> but a different person that experiences the same perception of time and reality might attempt to fight back against the future if they have nothing but bad experiences.

This is really Interesting and it's what I'm really unsure about. It seems like the movie almost suggests that you can fight back against it and maybe change it. Not sure. ",5cc7fb
d9x24oj,"No problem! The free will and determinism debate becomes even more complicated when you have God's foreknowledge in the mix. One of the solutions offered is [Open theism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_theism), which takes God to know only the possible courses of actions for agents, rather than the actual courses of action, and this is all that is required for omniscience and prescience. I am not convinced by this though. Perhaps this is the sort of ability that Heptapods have in the film where they are only shown possibilities, and still have to make future possibilities actual by their decisions. Doesn't seem coherent to me though!",5cc7fb
d9x213u,No problem!,5cc7fb
d9x11sy,"I will honestly have to re-watch the film to completely understand what was implied by the film itself.

My analysis is based both on the film and the book that the film was based on, the 'Story of Your Life' by Ted Chiang and I suspect they interpret the outcome of events slightly differently. 

I think it would make the most sense to say that Louise has free will but in the compatiblist sense, not the libertarian sense. Everything is determined, yet she can still act in accordance with her beliefs and desires. But also perhaps her acknowledgement of the necessity of events is a part of 'the gift'. She learns to be content with what is inevitable and just embraces the good in what happens to her, because from her perspective all times are equally as real, and she's no longer confined to the present moment, where suffering is all that exists in that moment. She has stepped out of the human condition--the perspective of linear time--and can see her entire life as one beautifully intricate artwork, with all its perfections and imperfections. 

This is evidenced by Costello's acceptance of his death as well as that of his friend Abbott. I think their unique perspective changes how tragedy is viewed.",5cc7fb
daf0aqm,"No problem!

Philosophy of time is an enormous area! 

Not only are there many distinct positions that attempt to address the scientific and philosophical questions in different ways, there are different positions regarding the very *method* by which we should attempt to answer these questions! Some of these certainly overlap. 

What do I mean by this?

Putting it roughly: 

There are those who tend to think that we should use science to answer these questions about time. All we should care about is what observations are made; we should only care about the *empirical* data. These people might point to the great success of our best scientific theories that refer to 'time', such as those in physics, including; Einstein's Theory of Relativity, [Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(arrow_of_time)) ([The Arrow of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time)), and even Quantum Theory, but also those in neuroscience and psychology, where our [perception of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_perception) becomes relevant (such as the Inference Model of Time and the Strength Model of Time). So we have notions of physical/objective time, and subjective/mental time. We may talk about time slowing down around a massive body such as a black hole, or time slowing down when a work-shift is boring or when we're experiencing a traumatic event.

But there are also those who tend to think that we should use not just science, but also uniquely philosophical methods as well. Conceptual analysis is one such method; one that involves thinking very carefully about our concepts. This method is a distinctically *a priori* method (*A priori* is just philosophical jargon meaning; ""Can be known without experience,"" for example, the statement ""All triangles have three sides""). These people think we can learn a great deal about time by reflecting on our concepts about time, our intuitions about time, and the laws of thought (or logic) and how they relate to time. This philosophical approach to answering questions about time is distinctively *[metaphysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics)* opposed to the former physical and cognitive theories about time. 

Of course there are many who may see the use in all of these different approaches!

Her primary mode of thought is still English, and so it limits her experience of nonlinear time. 

Instead of being fully engulfed in nonlinear time, like how I would imagine the heptapods are, she experiences flashes and moments of nonlinear time. And at first she is confused cause she sees fragments and doesn't understand what she sees. Had she been fully immersed in nonlinear time, she would have seen and experienced all, and everything would be clear. And that's how I feel heptapods live. In a almost time-god-like state.

Just cause you walk to your bedroom room, doesn't mean ur brother stops existing and stops processing events in the living room (no matter how much u wish he did). You've just gone beyond his bounds.

For heptapods, traversing time is as easy as traversing space. They go in and out of each other's bound.

Edit:
It's the ultimate game of peak-a-boo. Reason babies like the game, because they have bird brains that make them thing ur literally don't exist anymore just cause u hid from them. So the heptapods must look at us the same way, like children with bird brains!",5cc7fb

But I feel like this would add another layer. The film depicts how drastically different physical extraterrestrial life, modes of communication, and experiences of reality can be. 
 
So we see Abbott die and we immediately want to feel sad and add the layer of human emotion and response to the event. But I think the writers and directors did that on purpose. As a tool to depict that vast difference in perception. 

As is evident on how Costello told Amy about Abbott's death, with no sense of anger or disappointment or resentment, just stated it as a fact (and yes I know, maybe I'm projecting human emotions onto Costello), and his lack or response when she apologized. Just moved on with the conversation.

It isn't till later when u start thinking about how different their reality is, that u realize that maybe Costello has a completely different view point of the situation.

They don't try to change anything because they can't, it is what it is, has always been what it is, and will always be what it is.

I think Amy Adams (I forgot the characters name) figures this out at the end. Hence y she accepts that her daughter will die. And besides if time is nonlinear and u can experience it as such, then ur daughter never really dies, just like Abbott never really died. U just momentarily go beyond their range, but can pop right back! ",5cc7fb

I highly reccomend everyone read the original story. This was a fantastic adaptation (probably the best story/book to film adaptation I've seen in terms of balancing the ideas and best parts of the story with improvements/changes to fit the visual medium) but the story, by nature of the format, is able to explain a bit more about the perception of time thing. Essentially, the value of life with the perception of all time at once comes not from making ""choices"" but rather it is acting upon what will happen that imbues it with meaning. That said, she/they still seem to experience time linearly, just with awareness of the future as if it was a memory. ",5cc7fb

However, would I change ever having him in my life if something like cancer were to afflict him? No. He has opened my eyes to the beauty that is life and love. He filled a hole in my heart that I never knew was void. I have honestly never experienced this type of love and care that I have with my son. Before him, I was a very stoic, serious, and blunt person. If you asked my friends, I lacked the ability to have fun but was loyal to a T. When my son came into my life, he changed all that. I'm not an uptight ass as much and I'm definitely much more apt to show emotion. I definitely understood her actions and once the light burned turned on, it was hard to resist the reaction to onions in the room.

d9xcoff,"I think the hints for what happens in the distant future are presented through the movie, assuming I'm not barking up the wrong trees. It seems that human cultures have developed our abilities the way we have because the way our languages work and the way our brains are wired. This theme is presented time and time again throughout the movie. All human languages have a start point and an end point. Whether sentences are left-to-right or right-to-left, they are all chronological in nature. Heptapods do not understand things the same way. When the Americans are conversing with an ally nation (Australia I think?), they said they've tried algebraic equations. Something that we consider so universal as cause and effect. Something happens, and you get a result. They're chronological by nature. But Heptapods don't seem to understand those equations at all. Because they don't understand time the same way we do. They experience all time at once; things don't seem to have preventable causes or effects. And again when Louise is puzzling out their language she expresses frustration that they don't seem to correlate what they say with their actions. They say one thing with their words (visual smoke signals), and do something else entirely at the same time (mimicking the walking around or tapping on the glass). They don't inherently understand the cause and effect relationships that we do because their brains are not wired to think of time in a linear fashion.

So with that idea in place, my theory about our futures together, is that something happens to their culture that has a causal effect. Something that can be predicted and prevented if they were able to think about it on a more linear timescale. They needed to seek out our help because in the future of their species, we are able to help them predict the future and prevent the thing that causes it. Even before they themselves are capable of experiencing what the effect is, we can predict the possibility of it happening. They are incapable of doing so.

Now that I typed that out, it seems we've arrived at more or less the same conclusion. Your two points are pretty similar in thought as to mine. Effect and causality are what they lack, and we can bring to the table, because of our language structure.

Edit: Some options about observable evidence and avoidable consequences:

* Their sun collapses and begins the stages of going supernova. We have observed this happening with other stars and based on evidence, we can predict the future of a star that enters that stage. We can do this without actually being there and experiencing it directly. Knowing that future, we could propose an evacuation plan.

* Their home planet begins showing the signs of a massive climate shift due to greenhouse gas accumulation or a massive ice age. We can observe the changes in their atmosphere happening and suggest courses to take to correct it back.",5cc7fb
d9xkqkh,"

>2. Something coming from our linear perspective of time. They always know the future, so they have no practice predicting the future. We have mathematical algorithms and simulations to predict to high degrees of accuracy things that will happen. What if there is an event that wipes out all heptapods simultaneously 3000 years or more from now? They may not be able to see their own future past that point since none have future memories. Alternatively maybe there's a giant cosmic disturbance that muddies the painting and they simply can't see what's coming, even if maybe they will survive.

If heptapods were able to see time non-linearly (as implicated in the movie experiencing every slice of time simultaneously, hence not experiencing time at all), they would know everything that is going to happen since it has already happened. That indicates the universe is pre-determined. 

After all, it seems Louise had no choice to alter the future. But nevertheless, she could have gone differently. It was always possible not having that child. What would happen if she continued that way?

Having foresights about future is irrational. Let's assume if you know what will happen at point B, when you are actually in point A. (A is former than B) The moment you didn't like what is happening at point B, you would be able to change your actions (like having a child or not, it wasn't inevitable to have a children with Ian.), hence would go somewhere not-B. So, your foresight about point B would become false. In order to make sense, one has to see either all possibilities or not even a single one. We currently live in a universe that makes sense by not knowing (but predicting) the future.

To sum up, it was a poetic and baffling idea, well supported by music. It was a delight to watch. But logically, it wasn't plausible.

I dunno the majority of the films plot points were based around those what-ifs, which is why it seemed odd to just let go of them. 
The central tension for most of the movie's runtime is if Louise can succesfully communicate with the aliens before the world descends into violence triggered by their arrival - we see constant news reports of escalating violence around the world triggered by the uncertainty and mystery of what the aliens want, accompanied by Louises explanations of just how monumentally difficult and complex of a problem communicating with an alien really is. This is why I thought those two what ifs were so cool and important, because the main conflict and interest of the movie is where and how they intersect.

I cannot disagree with this more. This is precisely what suspension of disbelief is. There is no possible way to be completely 100% scientifically accurate and still tell a coherent narrative in under 3 hours. Like all good narratives, Arrival uses more coherent and accurate logic when it serves the themes it is trying to present and uses simplifications/pseudologic the rest of the time.

Could the movie have given a more plausible explanation than the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis? Sure, it didn't exclude the possibility of different unexplored vectors than just language causing the change in Amy Adams' perception of time. But IMO wouldn't have been particularly interesting or relevant to the themes of the movie to use up time explaining the mechanics of that process, when that time is better served exploring the emotional questions of what determinism and precognition imply about choosing experience even if that experience is finite and ends with grief.

Also
>It's never even necessarily made clear that fate in non-deterministic in this universe. Louise asks if you would change your future if you knew it ahead of time, but then proceeds to NOT do so which then raises the question if such a thing was even possible to begin with.

If time is indeed fixed and the universe is deterministic, then there is no way for Louise to choose not to change her future. Only different ways she could conceivably feel about that precognition.

In fact, if the universe is deterministic, there isn't even a way to verify if it is possible to change the future, since any attempt to change the future would necessarily fail and couldn't happen in the first place

First let's go with a basic theory that I think lines up with yours. The aliens are like Louise. Consciousness spans over a whole lifetime. Instead of vanishing from time, maybe the ships only vanish from space. Exactly like flatland, you and the flatlander exist at the same time, but you're on a different z axis on the 3rd dimension so you can see all of flatland and they can't see you. So in Arrival could the aliens exist in a 4th spatial dimension and pop in to visit us? Yes, but it makes things complicated since with see some 3d aliens inside the ships. It would be very difficult to construct and organic 2d version of yourself for flatlanders to see properly.

Now my theory has the aliens living outside spacetime, not just space. So looking at flatland, you can see it, even see inside houses, but now you can see the past and future too, all at once. This is exactly the alien's gift, to see all at once. If they grew up in such a dimension it would make sense that that is how they think and write. So to visit us in our time, they didn't time travel, they just visited while considering themselves without time. When you visit flatland they think you teleported into their dimension from far away, when really you didn't travel anywhere, just placed your finger down in their world.

So if this is true and their ship is hovering because it is anchored outside our space and time, that puts these guys in what we could potentially call the 5th dimension.

Tl;dr assuming they're in our 3d universe and time just raises more questions. Hope does the ship teleport, how does it hover without an energy signature, how do they instinctually know the future? How did they find us? Why did they never even point at the direction of where they came from?

Just because it seems like they time travel to us, doesn't mean they traveled anywhere or anytime to them and the above questions are answered, if we assume they're extradimensional beings. H.P. Lovecraft may even be the author of such creatures since his incomprehensible tentacled gods come from other dimensions.",5cc7fb

She has the map, and she steers the ship.

I think the movie leaves it ambiguous though, since we never see her foresee a possible future that doesn't happen. Also arguably the way the language frees her mind from perceiving time linearly implies the future is already set, just like the past is. Past, future and present are all basically the same thing, but humans just don't see it that way.

tl;dr - there are arguments for both interpretations. ",5cc7fb
d9w0zxt,"I sort of saw it as all these events were happening right then. Her perception of time changed away from being linear, so it wasn't necessarily that something will happen, but that it already had happened and was happening.

d9wsov1,"This seems to be venturing into the realm of Isaac Asimov's *Foundation*, where prescience is seen as generally a good thing, and Frank Herbert's *Dune*, where prescience is seen as generally bad thing.

I'm going to go down the rabbit hole.

With a discussion of prescience, free will inevitable arises. Parallel/alternate realities discussions pop up too. To paraphrase Dr. Banks ""if you knew your entire life, would you do anything differently?"" This seems to be the indication, to me, that she could see all realities, like Paul/Leto Atreides.

If this is true, you could see the outcome of every possible cause and effect, micro to macro. It would be very strange, as knowing virtually infinite realities would be similar to actually *living* those realities. You wouldn't be able to ""view"" them in real-time either of course, so the brain would be viewing infinite lives in seconds, as we see when Dr. Banks has a flashback and seems to go into another world.

We don't see this though; we see a linear, singular timeline. Perhaps there simply isn't enough time in a film to portray infinite realities!

So back to my point about viewing/living infinite lives instantaneously. There must be severe limitations to prescience in a human's brain, as being able to process every detail of every possible cause and effect would seem to be impossible. Maybe the brain is really just *outside* of time, and doesn't actually do the behind-the-scenes for prescience. I would assume this means humans who know the language are freed from the 4th dimension, and become extradimensional. There's no way someone could process infinite lifetimes just with their brain; they would need a ""medium"", or to break out of the 3rd dimensional medium and into a one that facilitates prescience.

With being out of the 3rd dimension and surpassing time, the 4th dimension, maybe everything just ""works"".

Time travel works, most obviously, since it would be the same as regular travel to 3rd dimensional beings.

FTL works, because space and time are interconnected and don't exist without the other (General Relativity). I don't understand it too much, but maybe just by thinking you are able to move through space and time, kind of like the Navigators in Dune, swapping the spice out for the language.

Immortality works, because when you're outside of time you don't adhere to linearity. Again, not too sure about this either, but I'd assume if you can travel through time, aging doesn't happen or can be reversed.

This goes on to another thing, I feel, about the Drake Equation and Fermi Paradox. ""Where are all of the aliens?"" Maybe they are all 4th dimensional, and they just chill in another time. Maybe it's hard for them to ""squeeze"" themselves back into the 3rd dimension, in a similar way we can't squeeze ourselves into 2 dimensional beings. Hell, we don't even know what dimension smallest pieces of matter are. Atoms, as far as I know, are three dimensional, but there are smaller particles than atoms.

Maybe it's impossible for humans to be anything other than 3 dimensional. Maybe there's civilizations in the second dimension, or even the first! These are just as impossible to even fathom as higher dimensions such as the fourth and fifth dimension. Maybe it's possible to transcend dimensions, and we just haven't figured out how.",5cc7fb

So, imagine if your entire life was spread out and you experienced every moment simultaneously. It doesn't even have to have a ""beginning"" and ""end"" necessarily. You can experience your birth and death at the same time. One moment informs the next, regardless of the order. So if you jump from your first day of school to knowing you're going to marry that girl in the corner: is life worth living? Are choices even real?

Then it becomes kinda philosophical and open to interpretation. [For example: she didn't need to have a kid, but the choices that got her there helped inform things she did previously. Should she still have the kid? Does she not have a choice?  I would argue yes as it is part of her life, and she still has a choice because she chooses these things because it's true to her nature and what she wants. She didn't see a future where she was a mass murdering drug lord. That's because she'd never make those choices to get there.](#spoiler)

Human's are slaves to what we call [the arrow of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time#The_psychological.2Fperceptual_arrow_of_time) and it makes it hard to entertain the notion of something outside of that. This movie might look ridiculous if you don't open your mind to the idea of what non-linear time might look like, the problems within, and different ways in which it can be perceived/experienced.

Also, final note, there's no evidence that the ""forward progression"" in the way we perceive time is the only way, or even the most common way experienced in the universe. At the atomic scale, time as we normally think of it does not apply. Particles can exist simultaneously in two completely different spaces and states, teleport, disappear, and be created out of nothing.

dbw02nr,"He never mastered their language in a previous timeline but got close.

The phone call from Louise opened his eyes and allowed to realize what he was learning before he attacks.

Ian claims it would take 20 years to decipher the language when the heptapod scribbles a ton of stuff.  In the alternate timeline where Louise is a divorced mom, it takes her 16-18 years to decipher it, with the inspiration of her daughter.  

Chinese dude attacked aliens, they left, Louise gets divorced, takes her 16-18 years to decipher.  Chinese dude doesn't bother pursuing research.

Louise masters the language when her daughter dies.  She is in contact with her past self and her past self downloads the 16-18 years of knowledge.

She publishes a book 18 months after aliens are attacked and Shang reads it.  Shangs learns that his past self needs to hear something to stop and tells Louise how to stop himself.

So...
Shang from a timeline that attacked the aliens but where Louise publishes the book much sooner than 15-18 years in the future, reads the book and learns the language.  He decides scaring off the aliens is bad, so he changes the past and helps Louise by telling her how to stop him.",5cc7fb

Slaughterhouse 5 by Vonnegut has a similar thing with aliens who perceive time as whole and the main character experiences his life in a non-linear order. 

So there is no ""*present self*"" for Louise, as the only present moment for her is whatever time she happens to experience. There are just events in different parts of her life. Her ""visions"" or ""memories"" were notably distracting, stronger than just remembering something. So during those ""visions"" or ""memories"" it's the only time in her life she experiences those moments.

So when she's at the UN gala, the scenes aren't flashforwards which she remembers in the present. She actually lives those parts of her life during those scenes, and then jumps to live another part of her life.

You're right about Paul seeing all possibilities. I can't reconcile that free will and having your future set in stone can both be true.

I saw someone else with this theory that she only sees one future, but I don't really know how that would even work.

So you're walking down the street and know you get splashed by a car, ruining your day. Despite knowing this, you have no power to make a decision to not get splashed? Would it just be your body that is unable to change, while your brain just anticipates it hopelessly?

Your take on it seems more plausible biologically, as I don't think a brain could realistically process infinite possibilities like Paul Atreides can, unless they break out of the 3rd/4th dimension and the infinite realities that they exist becomes a sort of network, negating the physiological requirements of prescience and providing a medium for prescience to process.

Leto II did what Paul couldn't do, which was turn into a sandworm which was considered a great sacrifice due to knowing everything basically. It'd be like watching the same tv show over and over again for 3,500 years. Paul couldn't live for that long, and he wasn't the ""real"" Kwisatz Haderach, as the Bene Gesserit breeding program didn't expect one until another generation. Leto II was a wildcard, as was Paul, so they didn't know if Paul was really it until Leto II came along.

Leto II actually *didn't* know the exact details of his death. This is due to the Siona gene that he spent the 3,500 years that protects humanity from prescience. I can't remember *why* though, and how it matters if Leto II is the only entity that has prescience, and when he dies nobody else would. The wikipedia page on the [Golden Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Path_(Dune)) isn't too clear either. [This](http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/1220/in-dune-was-the-golden-path-really-necessary) post seems to suggest that an unknown prescient predator would come after humanity in the future, so Leto II makes sure humanity isn't dependent on Arrakis and become decentralized so if a few planets are destroyed/taken over, humanity can still fight in a guerrilla war.

The scientists show up and the one alien that knows it is about to die tries desperately to bring it to their attention by tapping and literally pointing at the bomb.  If it is anything even remotely like us, then it will at least attempt to change the outcome (it's own death).  the other alien seemed agitated, knowing the other would die.  he shoots off, leaving behind the entirety of the language (I am guessing). something like that.  it's entirely plausible that nothing is changed.

Louise shouldn't be able to call Shang because her present would never allow for the future she ""remembers."" *Her* loop would look different.

Time, as portrayed in this movie, is a loop (in the way that it at least appears to happen linearly, but has no beginning or end), but everything happens at the same time, has already happened or at least everything is determined (though not pre-determined). She influenced the future by ""recollecting memories"" from said future, such as the number of the general and the understanding of the alien language (she ""remembers"" it from a book she writes about it in the future). 

What I deduce from it is that since there is no linearity and everything affects and depends on each other, there is no way to change it or make any decisions that would lead to paradoxes (like the general dying in a car accident before giving her his number). 

Which also probably means that the aliens were aware of the end of the universe and they just needed to humanity to see it too, so they could comfort each other or cherish the moments they have left together, (like she does with her daughter) ",5cc7fb

Part of me expected to be told that the child was in some way important to the help that humans were meant to give the Heptapods in the future, but that doesn't appear to be the case. (It still may be that Louise had to stick to the pre-ordained future in order to preserve this moment where she gets through to Shang and averts disaster.) Anyhow, it's a really profound question, do you create a life if you know it's going to be cut short and potentially painfully? Another way to ask: is it for you to deny this young person the time that they had on this earth, which is intrinsically valuable? I think with such emphasis on the moments of happiness and unstoppability of Hannah, and not that much emphasis on her illness and death, the movie was pointing towards the latter approach. ",5cc7fb

Our numeric system is based on Arabic numerals, the Greeks used a Roman numeral system which was cumbersome. For all we know, these aliens have an immense amount of mathematical knowledge, but it may not be expressed in the same way. They may not have a number system, and may rely on conceptual data to illustrate mathematical points. A single splurge of ink could represent all of their mathematical knowledge. 

This running theme in the movie was a huge downfall. Especially when they were on the helicopter and Amy Adams said ""Language is the cornerstone to the world"" and Ian said ""No, science is."" Science uses language to convey thoughts about the physical world, so does math. If you don't understand language, you can be scientific, but nobody is going to understand you. Likewise, if  you imagine somebody who has grown up in complete solitude but  is a mathematical genius, they may emerge from solitude with more mathematical knowledge than any other person in the world. However, they don't use our numbering system, they use a series of lines to convey multiplication, and dashes and dots to convey addition. They could've discovered derivatives, differential equations, whatever, but we would say they don't understand math at all.

But I wonder if the aliens understood what it means to be a human. Since the aliens are beings living in the non linear time (4th dimension?) they cannot understand the circle of life. It would be like us trying to understand living in 2 dimensional space. And the aliens had a reason for giving us this ability, they needed our help (whatever reason) and it required us to experience time non linearly. Because 
of this self interest they didn't consider what this would do to us as a species. I feel like this wasn't the point of the movie but I had this underlying thought that this was a dreadful fate for humans. I completely understand that my concept of this probably differs from what the movie was trying to conceive. 

Also I suffer from existential anxiety.

EDIT: Also Louise got this ability without her even wanting to. The aliens didn't give us a choice and they were set out to do this. I assume since these beings experience time non linearly, they knew everything about humans all along including our language and they tricked us by using our curiosity of learning their language and (supposedly) teaching ours.

de8o5rl,"> Then, there is the fact that she seems to remember her kid at the beginning of the movie, but that could only be cinematographic trickery...

Well, it does not have to be, because the nature of the language is basically paradoxical. If you learn the language (and ascend above the linear perception of time), then there ceases to be a ""before"" and ""after"" of you learning the language.

de3kesg,">  Time is still linear however you can view it from start to finish (or in a circle). You can see into the future just as you have remembered the past.

Then time isn't linear. That's a recurring theme throughout the movie (one that permeates it to death in my opinion): that there are no beginnings or endings. The Heptapod language perfectly reflects this, ""written"" in a circle, a shape often representing the whole ""no beginnings, no endings"" idea.

To ""remember"" the future means that future events are influencing one's mind. This doesn't mean that things can be changed; it just means that causality is specifically nonlinear. Causality as we're familiar with it always places the cause before the effect. In Arrival (and in extreme cases of physics in real life), causes don't necessarily precede their effects. [General Sheng, with an apparent limited understanding of this phenomenon, gives Louise his private phone number in the future. This event causes Louise to call him in the present. Because of her phone call, Sheng called off his attack, the world followed suit, and so on. Years, presumably, go by, and we arrive (heh) back at the party where Sheng gives Louise his phone number.](#spoiler) You can draw several such examples from the movie, most of which need to pieced together from scenes dispersed throughout it. I chose this example because I found it to be the most coherently and directly presented.

In any such example, there is no beginning, and there is no end. The events may have an order in time, but causally they form a circle; a closed timelike curve, if you will.",5cc7fb

When ever you see Louis's daughter - it's of a person that isn't born yet. She learns how to see into the future. So Louise had already seen the aliens, and deciphered the language. She just told her daughter about them.

Two possible outcomes from that:
The version of her who decided not to have a baby had visions of the future of not having a baby. Thus of four possible combinations (have baby, don't have baby vs. visions of baby, visions of no baby), only two combinations have actual real universes associated with them.

She has a lot more exposure, and even then it's left somewhat ambiguous how exactly it affects her going forward. 

As great, and arguably more effective, as her slow education on the alien language was, the filmmakers weren't going to spend an hour drilling down into that and boring the casual viewers out of the theater.

Who are they then? We never see them do anything, never get the results of them doing anything, and just plain never see them. They might as well not exist if they do at all. The most I can recall are the various relay people interacting with other global sites. There isn't even anyone in the chamber with them besides the handful of army techs.

> Maybe I'm mistaken, but isn't Marks one of the people working in the space ship chamber

Was he? I think you might be right. Damn, dude was such a non-entity that I forgot. Does make it worse in that case. He was there, he saw what they were doing, saw what the translations were coming back as. We never see him voice concern to Banks or Donnelly, never see him discuss opinions or worries of the Heptapods with anyone. Having him talk with the leads in the truck on the way back, in the lab, in the mess hall, something like that, would have been a good scene to show his fears and the fears other people have of the aliens, but we got nothing. Even if the leads had brushed it off ""irrational"" or something would give him some justification and some more character. They never build a character for him so his actions never come off as villainous or righteous but rather spontaneous and irrational.

You mention camaraderie between the rogue soldiers, but can you tell me the scene? I don't recall anything like that. Marks was at the beginning, had the scene with his wife, was in the background a crap-ton, and then went rogue. I don't recall him having any other dialogue with anyone.

One other thing about the rest of the characters in general; can anyone reading this tell me the motivation of anyone besides Banks and the Heptapods? Any other characters, at all?

> There were some clues, like the weird clay figures the daughter made, Banks telling her daughter to ask her father about the ""sciency"" stuff

Okay, I will grant the clay figures. I forgot about them when making the original post (amended later, before seeing this). Just that Banks was so un-reactive to it, I let it slide the first time. The father and ""sciency"" was so vague as to be glossed over due to 1) Renner's character not doing anything sciency, and 2) not behaving in a way that shows he would put science above anything else. Maybe if he had argued with Banks about the validity of math as a universal language vs English that connection would have been stronger. But we got nothing like that. This goes to their lack of chemistry and his flat character. He holds no strong convictions about ""science"", or even science vs language, beyond his basic career. Having him going down his own path (like apparently the book has) would have made him a much stronger character, and the conflict and eventual resolution between him and Banks would have built a relationship. I see what they were going for in the film by having him be called the ""sciency"" one, but their execution just sucked.

It would have also undermined a lot of the message of the movie had about ""language"" as most first contact protocols I've heard of revolve largely around math and science (see the stuff put on the Voyager probes). Again, this should have been a distinct part of the movie for a number of reasons, but wasn't.",5cc7fb

Okay, explain to me the motivations and characteristics of Donnelly, Agent Halpern, Marks, and Shang, and what the movie did to really show that.

Because Donnelly seemed to exist to facilitate Banks having a daughter and once he fulfilled that role was disposed of by the narrative; Halpern was a caricature of a CIA spook (kind of like Mansley from the Iron Giant but less developed); Marks was supposed to show fear and hatred of the unknown but just wound up showing how talk radio could brain wash people; Shang was a boogeyman because this film knew it needed conflict and decided this was the way to give it to us.

d9ww4k5,"While I think that is a good analogy, I think that the film kind alludes to predestination at times. With that said, I think that when Louise asks Donnelly what he would do if he knew his whole life, he appears to change what he would do by saying, ""I would talk more about what I am feeling. It wasn't about meeting them; It was about meeting you."" It just kind of bothers me, although paradoxes and what ifs are always going to effect a stroyline and bring up issues when really get down to it generally. My main question is that why wouldn't such a huge life event such as telling him, when she shouldn't have not been something that she wouldn't have done considering the ramifications. I guess it goes back to predestination and the continuity of the timeline, but as I said I feel as though when she alludes to knowing one's entire life, it gets him to talk more.",5cc7fb

I certainly don't think you'd say ""X's emotional reaction to it is her problem to deal with"" if we were talking about being raped. And I think she did rape Ian. She abused his consent knowing that he would not give it if she told him the truth.

Did you fail to understand the consequence of determinism? There was nothing at stake because the Aliens have the ability to see the future. They need help in 3k years and they're going to get it. 

They see the troop bomb but don't stop it.  

So there's no reason to believe that anything is in doubt. The Chinese could have flipped out, so what? The troops flipped out and the Aliens took their losses and continued what they needed to get done.

If it's all preordained there's no uncertainty. There's no bravery. There's no choice or free will. 

We're only led to believe there's tension, a chance of failure, a thin margin for success before it's revealed that it doesn't matter. Future is already written. 

> If humans don't work as a real team

This part was stupid, heavy handed, and corny. It was solved with a pre-determined self-birthing paradox that's unrelated to anyone's thought or intent. And the problem itself on its face is a bunk idea, that humans don't talk and can't work together but some aliens showing up is going to both simultaneously force them to work together, then fall apart, and then work together again. Without much reason save growing paranoia. Meh.

But it doesn't matter. Aliens know what's going down. Chinese could attack or not. It wouldn't provoke an attack back, which was the human fear. An attack wasn't coming no matter what the little human ants did or did not do.  

So the central tension of the movie? Was never actual tension. Just the perception of such.

> the gift of time-unlieanrizer language

Well, we don't really know if anyone other than Louise even got that gift. The other most intimately aware person, Ian, did not. He didn't see anything coming even just in his own life.

> Why are you thinking with your brain still switched off?

I think I've clearly out-thought you and most other people who saw this film. I backed up all my posts with logic and observation.

See, with clairvoyance of the future combined with the remaining question: free will or determinism, either case is horrific.  Either Louise could have chosen differently and did not, or she and all like her are doomed to know your fate and be unable to change it. 

The movie is a horror tale. ",5cc7fb
db9bm8p,">How is there nothing at stake?

There is nothing at stake because nothing can be changed. If a future where they needed help already happened and that is why they came back to change that. Either it didn't work or it worked at they never came back in the first place. 

If they have ability to change a future event that they already experienced then they aren't able to experience time non-linearly. Maybe you could say that they have to ability to see the future but then it doesn't make sense that she is seeing the visions before the aliens arrive. 

The movie breaks down in that either the aliens weren't able to save themselves in the future and destiny is a thing or it's a paradox and nothing works.",5cc7fb
db4m1ss,"Let me clarify, there's TWO things going on. (1) The Bootstrap Paradox which allowed her to call off the Chinese General.  This is a paradox.

(2) Non-linear perception of time, i.e. seeing in to the future.  This allows for the paradox (it's basically a time-travel paradox but being able to see in to the future allows you to bring back INFORMATION from the future without travel), but it is not the paradox itself. 

The non-linear perception of time is what makes us ask why she didn't change anything. There's no indication that she could not. 

So there are two concepts here. One the paradox magic solution and two her seeming choice to not change anything despite knowing what was coming. The paradox raises questions which can not be answered.  The choice or not raises questions which can. 

And if the whole point of the movie is that she gains this wonderful extra perception but then can't do anything about it... or even chooses not to, then it's a major downer of a horror film.",5cc7fb

I'm sort of amazed that the vast majority of audiences (at least according to rotten tomatoes) liked it. I mean they all turned heavy against M Night Shyamalan, no?  And I thought they turned against him for the same reason that I am turned off by this twist.  Magic tricks and comedy require really good timing.  And where as ""I see dead people"" moved along quick enough that the big reveal felt like a punchline, here it was just too slow. And a paradox instead of anything clever.

Memento was clever. Usual Suspects was clever. Even the convenient equipment failure in Contact became clever when it was revealed that there were 18 hours of static. The Bootstrap paradox is not clever. It's a paradox. 

And hey, I'm not down on exploring uncomfortable ideas.  Schindler's List was an amazing movie, not that it's very re-watchable.

Runner - though Blade Runner is itself an overly mythologized film that can be hard to properly pin down due to the different versions - but it is certainly a tier above films such as AI, Interstellar or Gravity.

I think we can not find the answer why did she decide to live in this way - maybe she wanted to experience that life, maybe she was afraid of changing the future (remember - future was not changed during the military crisis in the movie)

the gift enables us to save ourselves. But it depends on our choices what we will do - Louises choice was to call to chinese general, and thats how she saved us. 

I am pretty sure, that with that gift we can change the future - the purpose of the gift.

Another issue - if the gift means, that we will exist at least for the next 3000 years, what we could change then.. in our reality.. everything? I think maybe Louise understood this gift.. the purpose of it.. to save the mankind.. and not to save her daughter..

Let me put it this way. It is not about Louise. It is about the things that happen. What did heptapods see about the future of Louise. If they saw the same thing we did, Louise wouldn't be able to change it. Because then heptapods would be wrong. They should have seen the altered version of it, the final version that wouldn't be changed. They should have seen that Louise would change her mind when he understands the world as they do. But knowing what she will do means there is no free will.

Thought experiment. Louise sees the world as heptapods. Presumably heptapods saw the same thing about Louise. What would happen if Louise wanted to experiment the nature of ""there is no time"" and decided to not have a child with Ian?

Then when she has learned the language, she has gained the technology- this ability to choose from possible futures. She can now 'remember' into the future and chooses a path that will result with her and Ian coming together and having a child- a daughter.

I thought this was pointed at when in one of the 'memories' the daughter says that her father looks different now than he did. For me, this is Louise having selected a different future. But then you see, she asks the aliens who the little girl is, so this isn't her daughter at that point- she's just an avatar the aliens are using to communicate with her on a subconscious level.

Also why does Louse saying this sentence to him convince him to **not** launch the nukes instead of the opposite? I can't see why that sentence would be an argument to stand down.

In other words, the movie says ""time isn't linear"" but this can be said in 2 seconds - what does the movie ADD to that concept?  Absolutely nothing.  As for time not being linear being a common theme, are you joking?  The most obvious example is Interstellar.  You say that movie deals with relativity and ""touches"" on nonlinear time.  The movie absolutely addresses nonlinear time and its a central part to the plot (absent this concept, Murph never finds the lines, never finds her father, and indeed, never even sends her father away).  You say this movie was ""thought provoking.""  The CONCEPT of non-linear time is thought provoking - please explain how this MOVIE showed you anything else that was thought provoking?

Third, you say time isn't linear but also say that you can't change the course of time.  The contrast between these two ideas is interesting.  This COULD have been something the movie explored - it didn't.  I don't recall it exploring a single interesting concept related to the idea of nonlinear time.  Can you identify specific scenes or themes that I may have missed?

Fourth, this is an entirely subjective evaluation so I understand I can't defend the idea that Louise was not engaging.  I appreciate you trying to explain why you found her engaging.  I'd be interested if you can muster a defense of how the other characters were engaging.

Fifth, I don't think every element of a movie should ""serve"" the plot.  I do think it should add to the movie in some way.  I'd ask the question again - how does the daughter's scene add in any way to the movie other than to lead the audience to say ""oh, now I get it.""  It's like they introduced a stupid conflict (why does Louise not seem depressed when she says she isn't pregnant) just so they can solve it later (oh wow, it's because she hasn't had her daughter yet).  But so?  What on earth does this do?  You claim the fact that Louise spent 15 years as a single mother is ""a major component of the plot.""  Em, how?  Please elaborate?  How on earth is it a ""major component""?  It simply isn't.  As for your philosophical ""conundrum,"" this AGAIN would be a very interesting idea to explore - how one parent knows the future and the other doesn't.  But the movie did NOT explore this idea at all.  How, again, do they explore this?  As for your other points, you contradict yourself entirely.  You say Louise CHOOSES to conceive but earlier you literally state that you ""cant change the course of time.""  So she didn't choose shit.  Now a movie that shows a person living a horrible moment that they KNOW they can't avoid would be a FASCINATING movie - but again, this movie did not do that.  You invented a conflict that was never shown or addressed.  You use throw away lines like ""this is an incredibly nuanced and intelligent procession of events"" but you don't actually explain how, or you fail to understand what you just described contradicts your prior statements.

In short, and I apologize for saying this, I think this movie appears ""smart"" and folk are trying to appear smart by saying its smart.  The movie has so many flaws that its ridiculous.  I'm getting a little tired of these movies that people rush to say are amazing, only a year later for folk to say ""huh, yeah, not so great.""  This was a very mediocre movie that didn't introduce us to anything new, nor explore any interesting concepts.  It's the fucking Interstellar of 2016.",5cc7fb

She sees a girl, her interaction with her and yet she doesn't know the feeling of motherhood. Which is why she asks Costello who the girl in her flashforwards was. And only in the end she sees the face of Ian concluding that Ian would be her husband. It's not an experience of that feeling that she went through, but just a visual. I felt this is not enough to make her say or feel that she knows how good it was to have him as a lover and hug him, considering they hadn't even fallen in love with each other yet.  She just knows that they'll fall in love and will be married. Which is why I thought she must have had this experience in past to feel so strong about it. But yeah it's just a movie so you can say that I am trying to find too much between the lines and you can't question every small thing. 

Yes I understand that. Just that Hannah drawing that in her picture made me feel that it had a greater significance. Cz that way there were more people in Orange suits there in the shell who she didn't draw. For all it matters, she could have rather drawn  a heptapod instead (which she does portray in her clay art)

I meant when she goes back in before things explode, Abbott tells her to draw. But she says she is not able to do it with one hand. But heptapod, the language is written simultaneously from both ends. It needs two ends, two hands. How is she drawing this pattern with one hand eventually then?


I have another theory where I have some doubt. So we see that aliens arrive in a package of 12. 12 shells, which when combine together, could be seen forming a sphere. Is there a significance of that? Is anyone able to decode the pattern why they landed where they landed. And why did the shells start tilting?, Is it just an alignment before they disappear eventually?

The film's writing & directing missed an awesome opportunity to give their main character any kind of emotional/psychological development literally because they just wanted to 'get' us. 

In the beginning of the film, she hadn't learned the alien language yet so she was never experiencing any flashes: for some reason, she was just a miserable person and not a mourning mother (like the audience was falsely led to believe). Throughout the film she just... continues on like that. At no point do we see her realization that she's seeing the future & in it, her daughter dies or, if we do, she really seems no more or less miserable than she already was.

It was... strange. And it really didn't hit the heart like it could've if she'd started out as a competent, curious, ambitious & brave linguist that slowly learns the language, acquires the ability to see her future, and has to fight a brutal psychological battle to know where she is at any given time to influence the timeline the audience is watching. Imagine if the climax of her speaking to Chiang on the cell phone had happened immediately *after* she'd seen & experienced the death of her daughter. And imagine the tragic-yet-powerful impact the ending would've had if she was in the middle of mourning her dead daughter and *still* deciding to be with Jeremy Renner. ",5cc7fb

2. While I agree to an extent, I think applied mathematics and pattern recognition are two different things. Granted, he did use a computer to find similarities based on previously established parameters--probably by Amy Adams's character and her team. Sure, I'll suspend belief here.

3. Fair point, but the fact of the matter still stands that they are a plot device to introduce something that only a few characters can utilize--Louise and General Chang. Which makes me ask the question of why couldn't Ian see the future as well? If he's deciphering code, why didn't he gain the ability to see time in nonlinearity? Why did he still decide to leave Louise and accept impregnating Louise? You can make arguments for determinism and free will here, but that's a different discussion altogether.

There's movie Sci-Fi and there's Science Fiction Sci-Fi is what you said, anything that's remotely ""science-y"" that's mixed with fiction. This tends to encompass anything from Horror movies that merely take place in ""space"" (I believe there's a Friday the 13th movie that fit's in here) to zombie pandemic movies (world war Z) to pretty much anything that includes some type of futuristic technology (Back to the future and Star Wars).

The goal of hardcore science fiction is to be as close to the actual science as possible. This movie does that really well in a lot of areas. Unfortunately, in some of the areas, like learning to read pictographs giving you the ability to see the future, the scientific evidence given is really weak or non existent.

That they can bend gravity with their advanced technology is acceptable, but merely learning a language, with no other technology, makes you able to see into the future? It's like if you took the hypothesis ""You only use 10% of your brain"" and then make a movie where using 100% allows you to have telekinesis and shit. Sure, you can make a movie about telekinesis, but don't present it as hard sci-fi FFS. 

That plot point was so out of character for a movie that presented itself as hard sci-fi. It felt like paying to go to a rock concert only to have a classical piece as the final song. It's not necessarily bad, and would have worked in other cases, but it certainly doesn't work here. 

The hypothesis states that you will interpret the world diffently, which in itself could have been an awesome point in the movie and is an amazingly interesting question. 

*How do the aliens interpret the world? Will Louise start to interpret the world like them? Will the aliens gain empathy for humanity? Will this turn out like the Colombian exchange or will we find common ground? Could our language exchange be what makes us able to find mutual ground? Is exchanging scientific information enough or do we need something more to communicate? Is it even possible to communicate certain things to other species, like desire?*

These are amazing questions for a movie, and it even hints at many of these throughout. But for some reason they felt the need to just not bother, and introduce a far less interesting and out of character point instead.

What makes sense is that she uses that to gain information from various points in time. They hint to this in an earlier scene where her daughter asks her for the word describing two parties gaining something. Louise initially doesn't know but then she hears Ian say non-zero-sum game at the army base and we flash forward to her telling her daughter. That works because she hears Ian use  the word in another context at the army base. Why the General himself reveals the phone number and his wife's dying words to her doesn't quite fit.

As we're watching a scene in the future but in the background there is an element from the far future.

d9xybc2,"That choice weakened the whole story regarding emotional impact imo, and instead opted for a silly twist that had *no* emotional impact. 

The choice they made here - letting us know what would happen to the daughter - deprived us of the charming discovery of her future daughter that Louise made while learning the language, seeing/experiencing the thrills & joy Louise was going to have with her - the audience sharing the excitement and anticipation of our protagonist's happiness, and then the devastating reveal that the daughter was going to die at like 17 years of age.

Instead, the daughter's existence as emotionally impacting was annihilated by our foreknowledge that she'd die. 

Also, it's just fucked up that the first scene is Future-Louise narrating/showing us the past in flashes (outside the linear narrative) and out of real-time & those flashes have the same exact composition as Current-Louise (inside the linear narrative) seeing/experiencing the future in real-time. When you do that, you're just being lame: you're actively deceiving the audience and hoping the audience goes ""oh that's cool"" instead of ""wait you just randomly switched the meaning of that 'flash' device up on us and you think we'll find it cool? No way, Jose.""

I'm of the latter school of thought, lol. ",5cc7fb

da0hbzw,"While that is revealed to ultimately be their end goal, it still doesn't really make sense given events shown throughout the film. Their end goal is to teach us their language, but the plot is really about breaking the communication barrier that goes both ways, even though that shouldn't be the case. Again a couple things:

1. The Heptapods apparently have no plan for how to interact with humans. They bring them into their ship, and just stare at them from behind a clear barrier. They don't initiate anything and the whole plot is Amy Adams trying to figure out how to break the most rudimentary communication barrier. If the whole purpose of their visit is to teach us something, they're going about it in the least effective way possible. Instead the first thing we really see is Amy Adams holding up a white board that says ""Human"" on it and other scenes of her teaching them words like ""Walk"".

2. And again, the reveal that these aliens experience time non-linearly completely undermines the reasoning for these scenes and the majority of the plot. They should theoretically already know how to communicate with human beings if they experience time non-linearly. There's no explanation as to why they cannot communicate in a human language and use that to explain their own language to us. And on one last note, they never even try to explain how learning their language somehow allows people to basically be 4th dimensional beings. 

If the movie is really about aliens teaching humans, then why is the movie usually focused on humans desperately trying to wring out the most rudimentary information from them while nearly resorting to conflict and war after one slightly ominous translation?

President - Haha I don't think he needs to be there, but in all these movies you see the President being contacted about what we should do. Here you have A CIA guy (Ace Rothstein), a bunch of marines & linguists running the whole show. The only world leader we ever see is the Chinese general. You're telling me the UN and all the world leaders are just sitting around waiting to see what Russia & China do? Being nitpicky I guess.

1st Contact - Renner's character is excited to go in and meet them, while Amy Adams is shaking & wheezing the whole time. I didn't like how they portrayed Louise to make us think she is a damaged, grieving, emotionless life beaten zombie prof who has cliche female panic throughout (I'm a dude & I thought it was over the top).


Costello - Still think that it's dumb they let him/her? die. Aliens with advanced tech and future seeing abilities can't stop a man-made device from killing one of them...lame (only reason it is there is to coincide with Louise's decision which didn't need to be made.

As viewers, it only seems ""before she starts learning their language"" to us because we keep trying to rationalize parts of the movie in a linear timeline that we're accustomed to. We're trying to relate by describing things before one another. 
Edit: And it seems ""before learning the language"" to us as the viewers because we're limited that a movie itself is a linear timeline in which the director tells the story and reveals information to us (but not necessarily the characters).  ",5cc7fb

His wife was already dead, which was why using her last words in the phone call convinced him to listen to Amy Adams and stop the attack. The in person meeting seemed to be several months after the aliens left, presumably in that time the General had contacted Amy to find out exactly how she knew his number and wife's last words, so he would have known it is important to show her those when they met.

Also, we're told that the ability to perceive the future comes from understanding the aliens language. If the General can see the future, that means he been able to learn and understand the new language to the same level in the same amount of time as Amy, the world leading linguist, which doesn't seem likely.

Nothing in the film requires, or even suggests that the General can see into the future, and I think it makes more sense that he can't.",5cc7fb

Regarding the aliens letting the ship be bombed, maybe they did know that was there since the can see the future, but maybe they knew this was the only way to go about things. They wouldn't be able to attack the humans because it would look like an act of aggression. They did try to warn Louise and Ian by trying to point behind them.

Which allows them see time non-linearly. Not only that but it's also the small fetal of the movie that's incredible. Like you would miss it if you didn't think about it. For example, when people said the heptapods couldn't do algebra but they could do complex math. It's because algebra is linear and they can't see things linearly l. Which also explains why they would need help from the future. 

Not only this but many other things, like the ending that enfolds with Louise she approached thing. The problem was that you watched this movie. When in actuality you shouldn't watch the movie but experience it as Louise. Imagine seeing a daughter you don't have yet. Or actually just encountering the heptapods. People think about if aliens did come to earth, but nobody thinks if they came in peace and how you would react in that situation.

I see myself as having a cup of coffee next morning after I wake up, having a fixed timeline, means that no matter what I cannot choose not to have that coffee although it is hard to imagine what would prevent me to do so. Knowing what I will do always creates the possibility for me not to do so which will in turn make my knowledge of the future incorrect. All that remains then is me seeing different variants of what will happen given each choice(i can see myself drinking coffee or tea. and so on). On the grand scale this might work, such as no matter what someone would do you cannot prevent an event like WWII from happening, but on the really small, instant to instant event it is completely puzzling on how could that work.

All well and good until one considers the suffering the child goes through. I don't want to argue morality, that being a whole different can of worms, but what we know is Louise did know the child's fate and very much could have prevented it (unless i'm not understanding the idea of seeing the full time-line correctly). I understand she loves the child and would go through it all just to be with her 'again', but maybe set that aside for the good of the child not going through a terrible illness, experiencing the devastating sadness of confronting early and unfair death, the pain of illness, and all those countless moments the child struggled with why it had to be them. 

If she can only see her timeline and what she sees is only purely a reflection of what will come to pass full stop, then I understand there is nothing she could do. She could only experience time in a non-linear way. But if she could have prevented it, it strikes me as a selfish move to carry forward for a chance to experience that time with Hannah if it meant the little girl would experience a crippling and devastating demise.

If she wanted to change the future, as a mid-career academic linguist, how would she search for a cure to an advanced medical disease? It's clear that it's very difficult for people to comprehend her ability to actually see her future, and how it was unlocked by understanding the circular language, so how would she justify performing research on an incredibly rare disease by saying ""oh my daughter is going to get it"" or ""my daughter died from it"". 

If she could change her future, then maybe she *could* become an instant expert by beginning work on learning medical science, and then at the start of work, remembering the future of what she learned, and just doing that over and over until she remembers years of compounded medical study to the point where she can cure the disease. 

Or it's a closed time loop and it's a deterministic universe and she can't actually change the future. However, because she can see the future she can see all the decisions that lead up to it, and will agree with them. 

2) the gift wasn't the language, but the unification of the world from the effort to understand the language. if you think about the arrival of the aliens from the aliens' point of view, all they know is that they gave humanity their language, and 3000 years later humanity is united and advanced enough to help them out. There's no way of knowing of they know what happened on Earth in the meantime. 

4) She's the world's top linguist, and in the movie, appears to be the only person to ever truly understand the language, and therefore is the only person to have her time-perception unlocked. She writes the book and attempts to teach it, but who would go through the effort of fully understanding the language of an alien race that you'll never interact with? They were on Earth for like a month and left no artifacts to translate and understand other than their raw language. 

4) When the heptapods converse, they essentially do a data dump of concepts described in the circles. Ian and Louise have a conversation discussing the [Sapir-Whorf hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity), which is the idea that your perception of reality is heavily (if not completely) influenced by the language you use to think. The Heptapods' language has no beginning or end; their sentences are completely formed in an instant. Therefore, with a non-linear, timeless language, their perception of reality is non-linear and timeless. Therefore, they can ""remember"" their entire lives, start to finish, in the exact same way as we remember our pasts.

d9xjvce,"The ""have a baby?' line is from a different moment in her timeline than the ""it was you line."" The latter takes place at the end of the events of the film, but the ""baby"" question comes much later, maybe a couple of years later. If she wants to stop the tragedy ahead and have a time-abortion for the sake of mercy, the best way would be to not become involved with the physicist in the first place. As the film draws to its close, the happy moments and the sad moments are closer and closer in juxtaposition, suggesting their eventual synthesis into one single moment. I guess this is much the same way that our memories work in real life -- all of the past is fused into one in the present moment, and you have to accept the bad with the good. 

The fact that there's only the one female character could well be old fashioned studio sexism. There's also the possibility that it was a conscious decision, like in ""Silence of the Lambs,"" ""Sicario,"" or ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" to surround the main character with super-macho men to highlight the fact that she needs to constantly prove herself to people who are not as smart as her, and that despite how tough she is, she is also vulnerable if the men around her turn hostile. The CIA guy encapsulates everything she has to deal with, someone who's macho, arrogant, condescending, impatient and ill-informed. The physicist is attractive to her because he's not only her intellectual equal, but sees her as such, and recognizes the value of her ideas and incorporates them into his own thinking. ",5cc7fb

She never had a vision of the child until she studied the language. When she first begins having the visions actually, she says to herself dizzily ""Who is this child?""

ie. The reason Louse is stunned the moment he tells her his wife's dying words, is because that is the first and only time she has ever heard those words.  Despite her recollection of that moment being a flash forward, could it actually be a memory since time is no longer linear for her?

So like, the whole point of the movie was to not trust the order in which we see events (ie. the main twist).  Therefore, my theory is that the scene with Lousie and Shang doesn't actually happen at the ""end"" of the story, rather, before their phone calls takes place(for Louise).  After the twist is revealed it was kind of like ""okay, ignore the order of events, and focus on causality to determine the events' actual order"", which is different for those 2 characters.",5cc7fb

Pictures have no beginning and no end. There is no start point nor end point. Yet, they convey information within the linear constraints of time. They don't break time. 

We aren't even close to reaching technology that can take advantage of the weird aspects of time dilation. Let alone approaching a language of circles that magically breaks the human mind into a time machine.

da8k5rv,"Ok, now that I have the time to give you a proper answer...

In your message there is a lot of ""I"". ""I would have made the same choice as her."" and ""I cannot imagine never knowing my children, no matter what outcome is waiting for us in the end.""

I am happy to hear that you believe your daughters to be worth the possibility of going through problems that are similar to the ones that the daughter of this movie had to go through. That is really amazing!

But I just have to comment on the fact that you never talked about this in your message from the perspective of what would be best for your daughters or what they think about the matter. This is the problem that I see around me. That people selfishly make families, not thinking about the possible consequences, just being happy about the fact that they will have families. ""Am I going to be able to raise them, pay the bills, do I have the skills to manage conflict situations?"" I get that, nobody is making children with the idea that they will not be healthy. Nobody wants that and nobody should want that.

It is easy to people to say that they would make the same choice as the women in the movie (I think that most people would make the same choice) if you have never had depression yourself or cancer, or had someone close suffer from those things and had to deal with it.

I know families that have children who are paralyzed, cannot speak and feed themselves et cetera. The members of those families love each other very very much, but even then the mothers and dads always have the same thought that ""maybe, it would have been better to not have the child"". Not because the child is a burden (he/she is not), but because they understand how hard it is for the child not to be able to live a full life - probably never have a family of their own, fulfill their own dreams et cetera. Sadly, these thoughts only come after the fact.

Do not get me wrong, life can be hard on its own. No matter how healthy a child is born. Difficulties can occur daily, but there is a difference between knowing that a problem will ensue and still allowing it to happen, and not knowing that it will happen and having to deal with it when it does.

If my parents would have known that I would be born with an incurable (I was born two months to soon and some parts of my brain were not developed properly + they do not know that I have depression, they would have a hard time accepting that) atypical depression, I would probably punch them in the face (still would continue to love them) and I would expect my child to do the same to me.

So much unnecessary amounts of my time and resources are spent just so that I can deal with my depression. I have had to refuse to do so many things in life because of my depression, or have not had the chance to do them in the first place... And I would be fine with all of this, if I had made a wrong choice that lead me to this. You know? If it was my responsibility that all of this occurred or a random preventable event resulted in this (that leads to Posttraumatic Depression, that would be curable), but I did not make a wrong choice. I just got unlucky in the lottery of life. 

Would love to hear your thoughts on this.",5cc7fb

 In the movie she actually asks Renner's character if he would change anything if he could see his whole life unfurl before his eyes (or something to that effect) after she figures it all out. That implied, to me at least, that she did have a choice in the movie.",5cc7fb
d9xbxn8,"Agreed. I see it like how Dr.Manhatten experienced time where it is simultaneously experiencing his future present and past and knows what will happen but can't actually do it. He is just removed from the way we perceive time but can't actually change what will happen. She could change her future just as much as we can change her past.

Also since she already ""knew"" her daughter she already missed her. If you asked a parent after their children's death if they would do it again and know their child again I think many would say yes. The only difference is that she was already at that point before she even had her. The only thing I think she should have done is keep this to herself.",5cc7fb
d9wp667,"I think that's an interesting point that raises a lot of discussion, but I think that it's demonstrated to not be the case in the movie (in other words, that in the world of the movie she is able to make choices and potentially change things). 

Since you say you haven't see the movie yet I'll mention that the rest of this post does contain spoilers, however I do want to continue the discussion for those that have seen the movie. 

There are two major points to my argument that the future can be changed. The first is the terminology that the alien's use to describe what they are giving to the human's: among other words, they refer to it as a *weapon* and as a *tool*, neither of which is true if the future is unchangeable. 

Secondly, the main character is clearly shown in a future moment to not have a memory of a past event until somebody else tells her that it happened, when she begins to remember. Regardless of whether she in that moment experiences time as non-linear or linear with flashes of non-linearity (which actually seems to be most likely) it wouldn't make sense that she doesn't have knowledge of her call to the Chinese general. 

Rather (imo) what happens is she subconsciously determines a desirable end state (let's call it unity between nations) and through her experience of time (using it as a tool) finds a way to make it happen. 

The last piece of evidence is that the aliens come at all, tying into the idea behind my second point. The aliens essentially see a desirable future (one in which they are helped by us) and through their experience of non-linear time, determine the actions which are necessary to bring it about, and are able to enact them (delivering us their language, so that we will be ready to help them in 3000 years). ",5cc7fb
d9weiv7,Also in the film she asks Renner what he'd do with her knowledge and he says he'd do exactly what she did. He'd continue on and say the things he needed to say which is what she does by telling him. ,5cc7fb
dadkqsl,"Not only that, she may not even have realized she had a choice. As shown throughout the revelation scenes. She's not only experiencing time ""non linearly and all at once"", but fractally. She experiences the moment with Shang at the party, *before* she experiences making the call. So when he approached her in the party, she didn't really realize what was happening at that very moment.

Likewise, it's possible that she experiences the conception of her daughter at the very beginning of every thing. As if it were the start of her own life.

One implication that is hinted at is how difficult it is for a human to adjust to the non-linear way of thinking that the heptapods have. Maybe she never fully adapted, it's probably impossible for a human to, in a single human lifetime, fully understand the flow of time after being exposed to this non-linear thought space. It's probably the very thing that ultimately put so much strain on their relationship. People usually don't break up over any single one thing, unless it's some massive fundamental disagreement. I don't think he would have left her just over the fact that she told him about their daughter's fate. I think it's very possible that her existence in the continuum put too much strain on them. Especially if he never reaches her level of understanding of the language. Then he'll be living a completely different life than she is. Her firsts will be his lasts, and their emotional bond may vary wildly throughout. At a point where he may have started to love her unconditionally, she may be experiencing it as if they only just started dating.

It honestly boggles my mind, thinking about how a human might deal with thinking non-linearly through time, especially if said human has only ever known linear time up to that point. You just know that in the wake of the discovery of the heptapod language, there sprung up just as many philosophy courses, as their did heptapod courses, about the implicit morality of non-linear thinking. Whether it's even worth living that way.

In our human art, we often refer to the most important thing in our lives as moments, that they very thing that makes life worth living is the fact that our lives are fleeting. To many people, living ""your whole life at once"" may be too much, it is in a lot of ways the ultimate nihilistic experience of being only a single moment in a vast uncaring universe.",5cc7fb

Just as a hypothetical lets say she saw visions of the future of herself dying from aids, she contracted aids somewhere along the way and decides to pass it along to Ian because she just loves him so much and saw they had a happy marriage....until she revealed the truth if she chose to. 

I just have a problem with the fact it seemed to not be a choice made by both her and Ian. I know the story focuses on Louise, but maybe if they had shown that Ian himself had gotten the SAME visions, and they BOTH decided to do it anyway... that would have been beautiful. I just can't help but feel bad for Ian. The daughter herself said that Ian couldn't stand to look at her, knowing the future made him so sad. ",5cc7fb

d9wu196,"so she was accessing possibilities of the future? Random moments of what could be, given the current circumstance? I didn't read the story, I watched the movie, and the movie presents a pretty basic idea. She saw a different moment in time, brought that information back to the ""present"" (present being the time the main events of the movie took place in) and used it to call the general which affected how things played out. In a similar way it's mentioned that she told Ian the truth about their daughters condition early on before she is even diagnosed leading him to leave her (in assuming that's why). On both occassions she used information from a different time in the present time. And she didn't use that information right up front with Ian. hence why we never see him in the other non-linear flash forwards. My argument is that this is fucked up that he wasn't told earlier before being subjected to that, before he had a chance to say ""want to make a baby?"". She had the knowledge and didn't share it with him, he had no idea. But if she had no control over it then I guess that's that. ",5cc7fb
d9wtlit,I didn't say main characters always have to make the selfless choice.

Big difference between the lovely ""you can't give up living for fear of dying"" and ""if you knew that if we got romantically involved and had a child that will develop a fatal disease, would you change anything"".

Jeremy renner doesn't learn the language when the girl does? Unless I remembering wrong. We're not given his perspective on anything, especially as he seems so bewildered at her actions with the phone at the end of the movie, it seems they aren't on the same page yet as far as the circular time spectrum thing goes. I've been told time and again that all of this was better explained in the book. My answer to that remains: my question was in regards to the film, only the film.

she pretty much spells it out that at some point she reveals to Ian that she knew the whole time their daughter was going to die. This is the foundation of my entire argument. People saying she couldn't affect how things happen for some reason forget that Ian leaves in the future because he was told about his daughter's disease. She told him, so she has the power to talk about the future. She chose to keep that to herself. I don't fuckin blame him for leaving her. It wasn't romantic, it wasn't heartwarming. It was selfish and scummy.

- her: If you knew everything that was going to happen would you do it anyway?

The score could've been utilized more as well.

It was surprisingly dull and then suddenly next time they have a session, Amy's character's able to select terms, their corresponding inkblot, and combine them together to generate a full inkblot message to the aliens and you're just like 'ah... okay I guess that's pretty cool :shrug:'...",5cc7fb

d9ya9vu,"> Those flashes in the beginning were not representing anything Amy was experiencing/seeing in real time, but then later in the film, those same flashes (in style & cinematography) represented things Amy was experiencing/seeing in real time. The film broke code on their 'flash' device simply to fool the audience. It was pretty cheap.

I would argue those opening 'flashes' were completely fair: they were not 'out of nowhere' but in fact guided by her subjectivity. We shouldn't forget that the entire movie is actually a flashback being narrated by her voiceover from an unspecified time & place after her child's death. ""There are days that define your story beyond your life, like the day they arrived"" launches us into the flashback which encompasses arguably the whole movie (perhaps until we see the opening shot of the ceiling again).

The many clearly subjective (i.e. her 'real-time experience') flash-forwards to the future 'child timeline' from the 'military timeline' are no doubt compelling and memorable as they essentially define the most important narrative and stylistic aspects of the film: nonlinear time is not only the solution/translation of the alien's controversial language in the story, but also the very thing which guides how the film itself is structured.  However the 'military timeline' ITSELF is a flashback, and before this flashback she (not sure from where, but she is narrating from a point in time after the military events) recounts the ""beginning"" and ""end"" of Hannah's life (to who? see below) - so I think the 'summary of Hannah's short life' visuals we see are fair and still from her perspective (even if it's what she is 'remembering' rather than what she is 'seeing').  

A more interesting (perhaps ambiguous) question to ask is WHO is she talking to in the ""day they arrived"" ""day they departed"" ""do stories have real beginnings and endings"" voiceover which opens and closes the film?  Is it us?  Is it Hannah on her deathbed?  Is it her telling Ian the story of Hannah's death before it happens?  Is it a prologue in her book about the alien language?",5cc7fb
d9xsla2,"> she was fearless compared to any/all other linguists in meeting & communicating with the aliens because she felt like she had nothing left to lose.

daewdzs,"I'm kind of with you. I never try to beat a movie at its own game by ""figuring it out"" while watching it, but this time I definitely saw the twist coming.

The opening narration explicitly primes the viewer for it by pointing out how our lives are ""ordered by time."" So right away I was thinking about time as linear, non-linear, etc. I first really began suspecting it when it became clear that she was more *confused* by her ""flashbacks"" than grief-stricken by them. My suspicion was confirmed when she told her daughter in the one flashback to call her father if she had a science question--it seemed very clearly to be drawing on the ""she's the linguist, he's the scientist"" dynamic the film had established. I thought to myself, ""okay, yeah, these are flash-forwards."" And then the ""non zero-sum"" bit. By the time the line about not knowing who the little girl was came around, I thought it was obvious what was going on. 

That being said, I envy those who were surprised by the twist. I like being surprised myself... I'm just kind of puzzled as to why I called this twist when I usually try really hard not to. ",5cc7fb

At second, she knows her baby is going to die and she can choose to not having baby (she could chose to not huging Renner, not marrying him, not having baby) - that is the free will again, but she obeys her desires and motivations and therefore her daughter dies in the future (that is the determinism - inevitability of the death).

Traversing time is like a workout that requires a muscle. Destroy the muscle (the brain/the mind) and you can't do the workout.

I like your idea at the top of the thread--it helps explain why Abbott would allow itself to be killed by the explosion if they knew it was going to happen before it happened.

I get what you're saying when you can pop right back, but it seems to be the case that if you pop back you're only viewing what you've already experienced, so once one dies it would be almost like a loop, unless there was some kind of transcendence, or finality, with death. 

So I think you're right in saying one's entire existence would be like watching a film - and once you die, it would just be like rewatching it, although it'd be like rewetting it from birth, the only difference being actually experiencing moments in the present that you knew would happen, whereas with death one could only revisit those moments, perhaps.

I believe their design was actually based around the idea of a physical evolution in which they had no concept of forward or backward (something the movie kinda messes with by giving them a ""face region"") and how that would affect their language and in turn their perception of time. Chiang wrote it after reading about the theory mentioned in the film about language dictating the way one thinks.

deshowu,"The concept of action and reaction are meaningless in the context of simultaneous consciousness as Louise and the Heptapods experience.  They are not making decisions that will lead them to a destination.  The destination, the path, and every moment of their lives exist and cannot be made to not exist through action and reaction as that would require a present in which to act, and a future for those actions to influence.

Fermat's principle of least time is the principle that a ray of light will take the shortest path between it's origin and it's destination.   Consider Ian observing a ray of light passing through a glass of water.  The light leaves it's source, refracts when it meets the water, then continues along it's path until it meets the water.  Ian can observe action and reaction, there is a sequence of events where the latter appears to depend on the former.  The path could not have been the shortest path unless it refracted through the water.  Now consider it in the context of simultaneous consciousness instead of sequential.  The destination is known, so is the indirect path taken a reaction to the fact that that *is* the shortest path between the origin and the destination, or is it simply that neither the path nor the destination are the result of reaction and that both are predetermined?

To put that in the context of how Louise & the heptapods experience time: the origin, the path and destination represent the past, the present and the future.  The origin and path didn't come before the destination, all exist simultaneously, and are known at once.  The origin and path depend on the destination as much as the destination depends on the origin and path.  The present is as dependant on the future as the future is on actions past and present.  What Louise and the Heptapods do in what Ian, and we, perceive to be the present is as dependant on the future as we perceive the future to be dependant on the past and present.  To us the path and destination of the ray of light is dependant on the origin and direction of the light initially.  To them, the origin, initial direction, the path and the destination are all as dependant on each other, because the none of them existed first.

Our inability to see the future is what allows us to believe in choice and free will.  If you could see what is truly going to come to pass, then only what can happen to lead to that future, will happen.  The only way for anything else to happen, is for what you've seen to not be the future.  So if we accept the premise that Louise and the Heptapods experience the past, present and future simultaneously, then we must accept that they are powerless to do anything in the present other than what would lead to the future as they experience it.

I also wonder if Louise is capable of insincerity at this point (unless the ""kangaroo"" scene has a more sinister purpose). Otherwise, since now speaks 'septapod', she no longer has a perception of time. Things just happen because they happen, she experiences everything at once. Her existence is a loop-paradox, where she always meets Ian, always learns septapod, always loses a daughter, always meets Shen and sees it happen 18 months earlier.

dgsxq6o,"So; time travel as depicted in the movie basically omits choice.  I know it is slightly depressing to think that the capacity to know the future, also strips all free will, but it really the only way it could work.

EG. If she chose not to have a child due to fore-sight; how could she choose not to have the child (since that foresight changes to a future in which there is no child to avoid having).  The *only* resolution to this, is that as soon as the participant gains the future-sight, their future immediately and irrevocably snaps into an immutable form.  A form in which all your choices are made with full knowledge of their outcomes.  

In a way; you immediately snap unbendingly to a completely unchangeable future in which you have free-will, to choose your preferred ultimate destination.  (But if it is always the same mind making decisions and you are always making those decisions with the same information - IE everything that will happen - why would you ever change those decisions?)

Basically, your life becomes the best version of a life you can imagine, knowing the future. 

This is a concept touched on in the Dune book series (I haven't read it, but have wiki'ed it).  In the later books of Dune, there exists a ""God Emperor"" that basically knows the future.  The only way he can fix the universe from being so horrible and lacking in free will, is to actually breed humans that cannot be seen in the future.  Effectively, he breeds people that aren't ""fixed in time"", that he cannot predict, and thus returns free will to the universe.

With regard to Abbott and Costello, the final step for Louise to fully understand their language, was to write it on the wall (moments before the explosion).  

The military was gearing up to leave (because of the chinese aggression they didn't want to hang around the space ship).

If they hadn't caused her to gain that final insight, she wouldn't have learned the language, and the Heptapods would have failed to impart the language on humanity.  *The heptapods knew all of this*.  Abbott knew their death was imminent, but it doesn't really matter because Abbott always knew their death would occur then.

The morale of the movie, at least for me, is that first-contact is a **""non-zero-sum game""** where both parties can end up with more than they started with. A clear juxtaposition to the blacks-and-whites with which the government/military is often preoccupied.

Louise ended up with more than she was given. **The idea being conveyed is she perceiving parts of her life both linearly and non-linearly... simultaneously.** I don't think anyone whose ever been alive can truly wrap their mind around that but the movie did marvelously in trying to convey it.

In addition, Louise isn't a native speaker of ""heptapod"". It is reasonable for her to only scratch the surface of what the Heptapod's language is capable of, both due to her strong attachment to the human linear experience (through concepts of life, death, love, etc.) and the implied limits of human brain. *Heptapods are clearly inspired by squids/octopi which are renowned for their spacial awareness, which could be sci-fi-stretched to also mean superior temporal awareness.*

As for humanity, you're assuming too much about how quickly they'd use non-linear time to hack reality.

Why do we need to see them? It would be cool if they discovered cool stuff about the space ship and what not, but that's not critical to the story. The film rarely goes away from Banks.

> You mention camaraderie between the rogue soldiers, but can you tell me the scene? I don't recall anything like that. Marks was at the beginning, had the scene with his wife, was in the background a crap-ton, and then went rogue. I don't recall him having any other dialogue with anyone.

IIRC, there was also a scene where he and another guy watched a video of some radio show reminiscent of Alex Jones. They kinda looked at each other and didn't say anything. The things that struck me the most were the little things they said to each other after they planted the bomb, like when one of them tried to stop Banks and Donnelly from going up in a concerned voice, and another guy said ""let them go"" or something like that. And then there was them shouting at each other once the shooting began. It was these little things that I can't even recall clearly. But I remember thinking how the film made them feel like real people with motivations with just those little bits of dialogue and screen time.

Personally, I like the way Marks and the rogue soldiers were portrayed and feel that it's more in keeping with the film's style and pacing, but obviously it doesn't work for everyone. 

>The father and ""sciency"" was so vague as to be glossed over due to 1) Renner's character not doing anything sciency, and 2) not behaving in a way that shows he would put science above anything else. Maybe if he had argued with Banks about the validity of math as a universal language vs English that connection would have been stronger.

I don't see how 2 should be a factor at all? If he and Banks got married, then he's the science guy in the family. Regarding him arguing science vs language, it's kind of hard for him to do that when Banks made so much progress in communicating with the aliens with her approach. Though I don't disagree that Donnelly could've been a stronger character.

>It would have also undermined a lot of the message of the movie had about ""language"" as most first contact protocols I've heard of revolve largely around math and science (see the stuff put on the Voyager probes). 

From the little bit I've read about the Voyager probes, I gather that a lot of what they put on those probes are images and sounds?",5cc7fb

And the twist wasn't very shocking to you perhaps because you didn't resonate emotionally at all with the film and that you were bored per se, was the pacing slow for you as well? Did you expect more action/thrilling set pieces? Did you have expectations for a film that were not lived?

As for Nolan's Interstellar, Nolan practically smothered in front of your face to feel sentimental and emotional that it felt overkill. Still enjoy it a lot, but Arrival was more subtle with it's sentimental and love aspect.

For real, people are saying, ""best film I've seen all year.""  That sure isn't familiar from a certain marketing campaign, is it? /s

Actually, I think this year I saw that Captain America: Civil War.  The one with Spiderman in it.  That one had way more story to it than Arrival.  It had really pretty good cinematography and the special effects were top shelf.  And the acting was as good as the multi-million dollar fortune it threw at the cast (eg. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Chadwick Boseman, Cheadle, Olsen, Rudd, and hey.. look who's here too, Jeremy Renner!).  So if I were to compare the two films, I'd be leaning a little more toward the stupid superhero flick.  Yes, Arrival had a faint conceptualization aspect, but I don't feel like it followed through in explaining it the same that other movies of this ilk (eg. The Matrix, Inception, Interstellar, etc.) have.  As I pointed out in the beginning of this diatribe (note: sorry for it being so lengthy but you can see I am almost finished), the reliance on patchwork film splicing to express important parts of the plot falls short of actually explaining what is happening to our antagonist.

It is, however, weaker as a compelling story, as the aliens never actually visit us, but stay in orbit and communicate via computer terminal. Less action and less drama, but a much tighter system of mechanics with fewer plot holes. 

According to the screen writer who edited and adapted the book to a movie, they did make a conscious change to make it freewill. They were given pressure by the studio before approving the script - they felt that if they went by the book (which DOES clearly show that you CANNOT alter 'the future' by making choices in 'the past, because you're not seeing 'the future,' you're seeing 'time' all at once - basically like you're saying) that audiences wouldn't be happy with that and uncomfortable with the idea. 

It's a cop out for sure in order to Hollywood-ize the story and give the protagonists more power and control, and it's vastly different than the book which has a very interesting idea of time and our perceptions of it.

Nope. 

I'm trying to see this alternate POV that you think exists, but i'm not seeing it, nor am I seeing the connection you're trying to make to a sex crime.  

Lets do a thought experiment.  Lets say you and a friend go out drinking, and you wake up the next day with no memories of what happened the night before.  But your friend does remember, but is kind of embarrassed about what happened, and doesn't want to talk about it.  Does your friend have a moral obligation to tell you everything he remembers, just because it happens to involve you?  Do you have a right to his memories about you?  

Yes, it's from Louise's point of view, but those are also Louise's future memories.  They involved someone else, sure... But it was her future she was seeing.  Why is Louise morally obligated to divulge personal information about her own future memories?  What right does Ian have to that information?  Sure the information is relevant to him, and he has a vested interest in those memories... but those memories aren't his.

I think it'd be unlikely that the general learned the language since he probably wasn't the one dealing with the aliens, and the movie made no other hints that anyone else besides Louise learned it well enough to see the future.

I think the scene with the general was one of two things, and I'd be interested to hear how other people interpreted it: 1) The scene really does happen in the future but Louise knows about the phone number and the dying words when she finally does live the scene in her present time, or 2) The scene may or may not happen at all because Louise's vision of the meeting was just one possible way she ends up getting the information.

But either way, I think it was entirely Louise connecting with her future, and everyone else in the room, including the general, was just part of her vision.

As for when Louise learns about Hannah's disease, there was a scene where she and the doctor are standing in the hallway and Louise suddenly reacts in a way that made me think she was shocked by the news. But whether it was shock or sadness, that was at the beginning of the movie, which we know was the present time (after the aliens left) so she was still seeing visions of the future, and how she would react to the news. Going back to the general, I'm not sure about whether I believe she'll end up living out the scenes exactly the same way she saw them in the visions, or if they'll be different when she lives them in her present time. Since we didn't see any of that in the movie, I tend to think she'll live them out differently the second time.",5cc7fb

Remember, later in the movie, Louis publishes a book an the aliens' language? Hence, i presume, anybody who reads the book and learns the language can get that special power. Since, Ian basically worked closely with Louis in understanding the language, Louis doesn't have to teach Ian the language. Ian also knows the language to some extent. However, if this is true, Ian should also be able to see the future. He could have avoided marrying Louis. This is something even i am confused about. Maybe, you have to master the language to the level Louis did, in order to see the future. I should make a post about this sometime on Reddit.

ddcnqiy,"I too had to to watch the ending twice to understand. But once you truly understand , it will blow your mind.  In this world where we live, time is linear. What this means is everything(the past, present, future) doesn't happen at the same time. It's one moment after another. Day 1, Day 2, Day 3,......... You cannot jump from Day 1 to Day 3. Nor can you go back from Day 3 to Day 1. For the aliens, and Louis, there is no concept of time. Their whole life is a picture, they can see and live at the moment. Hence, for them Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, ...... all happen at the same time. They can easily jump between the days since they are not bound by time. Before you read further remember: THERE IS NO CONCEPT OF TIME.

To explain the climax, let me give you small example first: Only if i tell you that my blood group is A+, you will know what my blood group is. Without me telling you what my blood group is, you wouldn't know what my blood group is. 

Whereas, what happens in the movie is: Imagine, that you aren't bound by time. You are like the aliens, or Louis. You can see the future. You already know my blood group is A+ without me telling you *. Sounds implausible, right? Hold on, i will explain. You tell me, ""Hey i know that your blood group is A+"". I reply with, ""I think you need to know that my blood group is A+"". Again, this sounds like a stupid thing to say, because you already know my blood group is A+. But it was important for me to say that. Otherwise you wouldn't know in the first place that my blood group was A+. (See the line i marked with *) You actually saw the future in the beginning. That is why you already know my blood group. This is exactly what happens in the movie.

To answer your 2nd question, someone's dying words will not be shouted. Rather it would be whispered usually into the other person's ears. Hence it would be close to impossible to eavesdrop that conversation in the first place. Also, spies usually aren't interested in this kind of stuff. They are looking for more important stuff like military secrets, etc.

The subtitles for the dying words of the Chinese leader's wife which was in chinese was not provided in the movie. This is what she said: ""War makes widows. Not winners"". These words atttacked the chinese leader emotionally and also astonished him. Hence he cancelled the war.

""Abbott is dead"" and ""Abbot died"" both mean the same if i am not wrong.",5cc7fb

Also, to answer your other question: to say ""he is dead"" means that at some point he died and that for every other point thereafter, he did not live.  In this movie universe where time is ""not linear,"" there would be no exact moment of dying and the moment of dying would not necessarily *be experienced* as before or after any moment in which the dying person was not living.  I hope that makes sense.

I say ""be experienced"" to add the subjective spin on reality because the ending of the movie makes clear that [time can be experienced from multiple perspectives, and there is no singular A->B->C despite that people who do not know heptapod - or know it well enough - cannot see time other than A->B->C.](#spoiler)",5cc7fb

- The political plot is rendered pointless by the revelation that the Aliens can view the future.

Let one of their kind die (why?).

They thus would do nothing if the Chinese did the same.

- The political plot was ""solved"" with a bootstrap paradox... which is basically a solution from nowhere.  A paradox might tingle the brain of casual viewers, but it's a cop out. A non-reality. A deus ex machina. Poor writing for a movie that is supposed to be discussing heady theory.

a) This is left ambiguous on purpose, but its fun to think about. My personal theory is the aliens need help in a war.  The aliens are peaceful and never display any weapons at all.  in fact, they confuse the words for weapon and tool so it's possible they don't really understand warfare.  Humans are super aggressive throughout the film so it'd be a neat twist if they needed us because of our fatal flaw.

b) She doesnt.  WE see the flashbacks but she doesn't reference them until after she starts working on the language.   Remember the story, like the alien language, is presented as a complete package with no beginning or end.  Also, once she gains the perspective to see time, ""before"" and ""after"" don't really apply anymore.  Once she gains this power then she has always had it.

c) the Alien always knew it was going to die, it was following its path as it always knew it would.  The aliens knew everything that would happen and they knew it was going to work out the way it did.

d) This occurred to me too... my best guess is that if they communicated in English then Louise would never have made the leap to thinking in their language.  they had to create the crisis in order to push humanity forward ",5cc7fb

When you think non-linearly, there is no past or future.  Your interpretation of reality is cyclic, so you can see the entirety of your existence.

In the alien way of thinking and perceiving (non-linear), you can feel the entirety of your existence at one moment.

I still think the inclusion of the canary was a trivial stroke of genius.  It shows a) how primitive we still are, and b) the metaphoric relation to needing to speak to survive.

I am shamefully forgetting this part of the story and cannot comment.

I personally can't decode any meaning to their landing points.  It seemed irrelevant other than to needing to diversify the origin of the message to encourage our collaboration.  They did mention that the only pattern they discerned was due to electrical storm patterns, which, from a scientific level, could hold a lot of meaning. (beyond my understanding).  I personally think the number 12 was used as a reference to the 12 disciples/apostles; ""teachers of the gospel"".

Louise was able to learn the alien language throughout the course of the film without necessarily relying on repetition of previous/future memories.

But my take on that term would be that a plot tries to make more or less detailed and comprehensible claims about a possible future, but here i see very much left to imagination. It's unclear how the aliens came here, how these spaceships operate, what they want, except some ""help"" in 3000 years... So to me, the sci-fi-genre is almost just a ""pretext"" for the real mind-bending endeavour: What if spacetime really is a fixed instance and our perception of moving through time just an illusion? Some aspects of a Many-World-Hypothesis seem to suggest such views, as far as i understand: Every possible state of the universe is already laid out, our perception of taking a path through time with an uncertain future is just a constraint of some Kind. What if we further could overcome this constraint? What if our minds really are confined to narrow thinking by our archaic languages (a thought the SWH would highly suggest)?

Again, not that i would buy any of those claims, but the quintessence arising from all this i find highly intriguing: How would we live our lives if we were able to see that life in its essence always contains life and death, joy and suffering, gains and losses? If there was no way of getting it precisely right even if we knew what would get to happen? Would we be more able to pursue what is good, as long as we have it?

I think the idea is that if you are perceiving a future that you want to happen, you will work to make sure that it does happen (which, bizarrely, may include doing something in the present to influence someone in the past who can perceive the future). Abbott knowingly sacrifices himself not because time is unchangeable, but because the Heptapods know that is how they must secure the humans' aid for their species in the future. Louise sees a future where the crisis has passed, knows she has to call General Shang to secure it, and does so. It's also implied General Shang learned Heptapod (perhaps Louise caused it to ""click"" for his mind with whatever she told him), which is why he knows he has to meet Louise and tell her something she needed to know in the past.

The answer to the supposed plothole is that the purpose of the Heptapod' visit is to teach humans their language, not to actually communicate. For the Heptapods to teach these future-blind humans their language, they have to play along with the language game. It's not enough just to drop an English-Heptapod dictionary on Earth.

I think the heptapods are controlling the flash forwards that she (and Chang) are experiencing. After the heptapods leave Louis lives her life in linear time, and if learning the language gave her the ability to control time, wouldn't that not be the case? 

Also, we see that the Chinese do have a grasp on the heptapod language, maybe not as full of an understanding as Louise, but we do know that they received the same message that the Americans did: ""use weapon."" Louise is our protagonist, and we are seeing everything from her perspective, but that doesn't mean that no other human is having similar experiences, it just means that we are not seeing those experiences.",5cc7fb

Third, Chang and Dr. Banks do not receive all of their future memories when they experience the future, the heptapods are merely allowing them to experience the future in their present consciousness.

I'm of the belief that she's the only one who ever understands their language because she's the only one to converse with them.

You wouldn't be able to practice it with native speakers (you can't even speak it), and you can't write it without a computer program. It'd be like learning a very complicated cryptographic code for some seemingly impossible ability, which only one person has. Clearly Ian never bothers learning it, and he would be the next best at it. 

Also, what if she gives up explaining to people that she's not crazy and that she actually can see the future? Maybe she thinks that the death of the human experience isn't worth the advantages of non-linear time perception.

I suppose you could say the flashforwards to the time prior to the aliens showing up were a part of learning the language affecting her whole life.

 Near the beginning of the movie, the military points out that the hectapods landed in random areas but are not communicating with each other in any way that we can detect.

But the non-linear perception for her only extends as far back as when the movie begin, as that is when she first gets the visions of her future daughter. 

So, in that case, you could take it as that being part of how the language works, in that you could only go so far back as when you first start to learn the language. 

Or you could take it as she hasn't fully mastered the language which is why the visions only go back so far. But in this case, one would think that when she does (if she ever does) master the language, it would transfer backwards and the visions would extend further back into her past, when it clearly doesn't in the movie. And I guess a solution to that problem would be what you said, in that 'unlocking' the language happens in stages.

dbrq4ll,"It really comes down to the old, ""Is it better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all?""

The movie presents the problem of what's worse, having a child that you know will live a short time or never getting to spend any time with that child at all?",5cc7fb
dbgg8zk,"But this is exactly what the movie was trying to make you think about. It wants the audience to debate the question that Louise literally asks Ian in the movie, ""If you could see your whole life from start to finish would you change things?""

Apparently your answer is yes because you are thinking from the point of view of the child's suffering, and  something like that should be stopped if possible. 

That was Ian's answer as well, as we learn when Louise says to her daughter that dad left because mom told him something and he thought she made the ""wrong choice"". Ian was angry that Louise foresaw their daughter's future but didn't tell him until it was too late, so he decided to leave to spare him the pain of growing even closer to his daughter just to lose her. 

But that is the natural answer for us because we perceive time as linear, so if you tell me I could do something now to avoid pain in the future I am probably going to choose the path that avoids the pain. I haven't experienced it yet so might as well avoid it. And then the movie poses the question, *what if* you didn't perceive time linearly. That's why Louise's answer was no, because by knowing the future she had actually already lived through all the happy and beautiful moments with her daughter, and those outweigh the sadness of losing her. She didn't get to make the choice ahead of time, because her special ""power"" meant she had already lived through it. Time is not linear for her.

It's a question that people grapple with in real life too when faced with tragedy, which is what the previous commenter was getting at. It's not about whether you would wish cancer on a loved one. It's about examining how you deal with tragedy, and asking at what point would you choose to erase the best part of your life just so you wouldn't have to deal with the pain of losing it. When looking towards the future, it's easy to say I won't have a kid if I know they will die of cancer at 10 years old. But if you are already at that point and looking back toward the past, the question becomes much more difficult. It's a philosophical debate with no right answer.

Louise's path is set, she accepts it. She gets glimpses of her future motherhood and the love of her husband and that of her child, this is why she says ""I had forgotten how much I had missed your touch"" when Renner's character hugs her for the first time ever, as the alien ship leaves. Louise had already gotten to glimpse both their marriage and their separation.
This is also the most important plot element in the whole movie: as the alien ship leaves, Louise already knows she will have a great career as the definitive expert on the Universal Language, she may marry and if she has a child, that child will die. She could choose to avoid marrying Renner's character, but the love of her daughter, albeit for only 14 years or so, is so strong and her impact on Louise's life so deep that Louise can't bear to be without it, even though she knows it will end in terrifying sorrow. It is the saddest but also the most loving and sacrificial gesture I've ever seen on film. Her path doesn't change, and she accepts it, even cherishes it.

As far as the aliens - it raises an interesting point.  The aliens already speak english and understand humans perfectly - they allow that whole process to roll on because they think it is the most effective way to communicate with the humans and teach them their language. We're meant to believe that they are more masters of time than even the MCs who learn the universal language - they say humans help in some undetermined way 3,000 years into the future and thats why they want to make sure they assist in getting humanity to that point now",5cc7fb

dev8bnb,"Yeah thanks for being calm and attacking me unlike this other arrogant guy who might just as well have mental problems since he would rather have the Nazis win WW2 and would kill people like the main character of the film. 

Sorry, had to get that out of the way. The movie was never about the inability to communicate. Was it a theme? Yes but it was not the main theme of the film. We already have so many films on this all the way from silent films. From the top of my head I can think of Synecdoche, Babel, Shame, 12 years a slave, Anomalisa, Blue Valentine, Amour, I am Sam and the list goes on. Trying to use aliens for this would have been super simple and shallow compared to the other films I mentioned above. I am not saying that they should not explore that theme but I can't think of it being done in a more complex manner than those films.

The main theme of the film is fate and if life is more important than death. Sure, fate is a main theme of many romance film and there are even films like Final Destination that deal with this but I don't think I have seen a lot of films deal with it in such complexity and in such a tragic way. 

The flash forwarding first of all was just to present the film the way Amy Adams sees the world. I am pretty sure when we first see the first flash forward we think it is a flash back. This kind of shows that she can see both the past and future. It kind of shows as the future being the past at the same time as being the future. Kind of hard to grasp and maybe nonsensical but this is also shown through the circle. The circle representing time and if time is a circle then time becomes non linear. She lives in different time simultaneously.

This introduces the theme of fate because if time is a circle then she is experiencing the consequence from her choice as soon as or before she makes the choice. It is unable to alter a consequence that had already happened. If she goes to buy chocolate ice cream and see in the future that she is eating chocolate ice cream,she cannot change it because she already has eaten the chocolate ice cream(or still eating it) 

The theme of life is more important than death because lets say we take my previous interpretation of fate out, what is the reason that Louise let's her daughter be born? It is because she can see life in a bigger picture and says that she would rather have her daughter have a life with love and joy in cost of a tragic and painful death than have her daughter be washed away with her blood during her periods and practically taking away someone's future existence that she has experienced. Why does Abbott(the alien) go to Earth even though he knew he would die. It is because he could see his life in a bigger picture and probably felt like he earned his death. The film is called ""Arrival"" for the very same reason showing that the arrival of a person is more important than the departure. Same with the name of the short story. ""Story of your life"" meaning that the story og your life is more important than the story of your death.


My latter interpretation also explores the idea of how life has pain and grief in life and that is what makes us human.

df84o6u,"I said that the film would have been mediocre. The other things that were ""unnecessary"" is what gives the film it's substance and it's thought provoking themes.

d9yy3t9,"If you realize that for the Heptapods already know what's going to happen and have no way of changing it, it closes a lot of the holes. When the time comes, they play their role, and that's that.

However, 3000 years before then, they deliver their language to Humanity, and it appears that it's the delivery of their language that causes humans to help them. So, they do it, when the Humans ask why they're doing it, they explain that in 3000 years we help them out.

* We don't know they arrived with  non-linear time abilities. They just showed up and vanished. Could have been FTL. I don't believe it was ever explained (which is ok as far as I am concerned)

* Could you expand on the implications of non-linear? I am not sure I understand the relation to the dying daughter as a hole.

* Good question, I don't know. The heptapods did seem aware of the bomb before it went of. How far ahead would change the interpretation. 

* Well, technically we all know we are going to die and very few of us decide not to carry on. Even though Hannah does die, it is not unreasonable to think that she had impact on other people besides her mother. Maybe she was someone's first love and wrote a kick ass song about her? Maybe Hannah composed a dance piece or wrote a book or her sickness ended up furthering a cure to the disease she suffered from?

It's not a hardcore sci-fi film, but it's still sci-fi. Some of your questions are arbitrary, and probably doesn't even matter. 

> How do you know they can see at the beginning ?

What do you mean by this?

> There must be people who decided to fuck the timeline if they know what's coming up ahead ? 

Only people that learned the language can go into the future, and that person is Louise so far, so your question is hypothetical. And you do not know what's coming ahead per se. By learning the language you do not all of a sudden know the future, it doesn't suddenly flow into your consciousness like a broken dam. You have the ability to go into certain points into the future and look into it, that is the point when you are able to gain knowledge from your future. Think of it as being able to peak into your future rather than knowing everything about your future all at once like an epiphany. 

And what do you mean when you say ""fuck the timeline""?

>  Does this mean choices do not matter anymore ?

That is quite the contrary, this movie actually ask us a question, would you change anything right now knowing your future? For Louise she didn't, because of the good memories and experiences she was going to be going through with her husband and daughter.

dcqvavu,"She begins having these altered conceptions of time before entering the gas room. So it can't be passed on that way. The concept of language changing your reality (and much of the movie) is based on the [Sapir-Whorf hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) of linguistic relativity. That being that the way your language functions can alter your perceptions of reality, including time. The theory has at least partially been debunked, but it's still delightful to try to wrap your mind around it. ",5cc7fb

Ian and the other science guys could use the heptapod Speak 'n' Spell, but she intuitively understood it and was thus gifted with an understanding of the nature of time.

The short story had a slower buildup of Louise learning the language, and Chiang was able to explain things technically, but in a way that I think filmgoers might have found too boring.

d9x3yil,They happened before her birth.  She can see her future due to the mastery of the heptapod language and its time properties.,5cc7fb
d9yxre7,"0) I'm working on articulating a theory that the heptapods experienced time in 'radial time'. Radial time is not experiencing all of time simultaneously. If you picture a a sequence of events as points arranged in a circle, radial time is being able to experience two points connecting a chord through that event circle. 

For example: She only realizes who her baby daddy is when she is looking at Ian in the field and (presumably) falling in love with him (at that moment). 

1) If the radial time idea has any merit. There is some communication that is possible between the two points. This is demonstrated by her knowing the General's number from an event in 'the future'. 

Knowing the General's information implies that there is Information (in the Shannon sense of information) passing between the two points. If the Heptapod language just increased the ability to compute probabilities, any valid combination of the General's number are still as likely as any other. 

If there was a cure for Hannah at some point in the future it does not necessarily mean it was available during Hannah's life cycle. 

2) Is suspect 3000 years was the hetapod's time line. They would need our linear time perspective that allows for cause-and-effect to solve some problem in their future that they currently so no resolution to. 

3) I *think* the General grok'd the language to. I believe they were both participating the in flash forward. Basically they were sharing a secret out of band with linear time such that they could establish with the other that there was something going on. I don't think the content of his wife's last words were important. It was something he was confident only he knew (assuming there was no one with him when his wife passed and he told no one else). So he cold tell her ""in the future"" to verify there was information going to the past with out risk. ",5cc7fb
d9yu5os,"For 1.), I'd search for cancer researchers on the young side who also learned the Heptapod's language. (Numerous scientists across the fields would leap at learning Heptapod I'd wager, once they learned how it could advance their research.   I knew several people who learned Latin in the biological sciences thinking it would help). Have them look to their future to see if the cure is created by them.  If it isn't, perhaps what they learn from seeing a 40 year career in research would help them speed up research now... which could speed up when the cure arrives.... then have them look ahead again...  and repeat.   If Louise could jump start her learning of the Heptapod language by looking ahead to see her book and lectures... couldn't a cancer researcher do the same thing?

4.)  I think tons of people would learn it, knowing the gift it gives them.  Now, many wouldn't be successful, but I'd say motivated scientists would get there.  The ""teach yourself"" trick Louise learned could vastly change the way we learn, study and research.

I wonder how much you could change things?  Like if I knew Heptapod and knew today I was going to die in a car crash when I went to the store to buy some pasta...  what would compel me to go out?  When I could just go, ""I think I'll play a few more turns of Civilization and let that all blow by.  Go to the store after one....more.... turn...""",5cc7fb
d9yus0i,"Wow, thanks for reply! Now my head wants to explode a little less:) But still wants though, because for 1) I can argue that she could somehow involve time recursion - even if she'll learn very little about the disease, it allows Louise from the past to start learning about the disease already knowing something and then learn a little more and repeat..:) But that's sound very stretched and fucked-up so that one can be scratched out

2) I think if the real gift is unity, then the aliens will be quite disappointed, because humanity will return to its quarrels the moment they are gone.

4) I still don't understand how pictures of any kind can make you see the future. Don't you need some expensive quantum mechanic device for this?:) that's sound more like some religious belief than science",5cc7fb

dcu51pk,"Yep, I kinda thought the same at first, too. But, do we really know how that ends up? Do we know she doesn't make changes somewhere along the plot that will alter that future? Heck, we don't even know if in the future we do see through Louise that they even stay broken up - it seems entirely possible to me that they get back together after their daughter passes. 

That said, I am playing devils advocate there; I think the future she does she is the one that occurs and we just don't see the full picture so we shouldn't make assumptions (like we did at the start; assuming her visions were of the past). We kinda have to think about time in a different way. She sees time differently, she sees everything together all at once, and she obviously can learn in the 'present' from seeing into the future (the Chinese scene). This scene has some possible inconsistencies - it was actually an addition to the movie and a possible change away from the source material. Likely they did this to 'Hollywood' the plot and make it seem more appealing and digestible. 

In the source material, she doesn't have some ability to change the 'future' by making changes. This is kind of where I think we can see that the movie was shooting for the same idea but just added in that sloppy Hollywood twist where she can change things in the 'present' to alter the future. It seems pretty possible to me the Chinese general had visions of a future where he did indeed attack the aliens, maybe that's where he sees his wife die and hears her last words?

Anyway, the idea is not that things are predetermined, but that she can see the definitive future. She's not seeing things she can alter but seeing simply what happens and develops, not because it is destine to happen, but because that *is* what happens. It's tough to convey in a Reddit comment, made harder by the Hollywood changes away from the source material (which doesn't make an outright logical hole, but raises questions where the source material cleverly avoids them. The source tackles the idea that even though we see the 'future,' we cannot make changes with that knowledge, because what we see is what happens, elsewise we wouldn't have seen it. There isn't s future, a past, a present as much as there just 'is' time - a concept made tricky inherently due to how we perceive time naturally as humans. It's like trying to describe blue without the frame of reference to other colors - or maybe more accurately trying to describe what blue tastes like lol) ",5cc7fb

*Maybe I'm being too rigid, but in her time loop, at no point did she learn how to decipher the aliens, there was no effort - the only reason is because she wrote a book, because she read the book, the film takes her own agency out of the picture.",5cc7fb

d9w2yrw,"Really great point. I know the general reading is that Louise had a choice, or at least she is a ""heroic"" character in light of your thought because she chose the path that would give her the future experiences-- and suffering-- to enable the peaceful ending that occurred. But I had a feeling that she kind of didn't.

If she really had any agency in choosing a different path, wouldn't her ability to view time non-linearly mean we would have seen visions of an alternate timeline that does not come to pass based on decisions she makes at different moments? To my knowledge, we only saw what did happen (right? maybe I'm missing a scene here or there).

That's why her question at the end (""Would you do anything differently?"") was so poignant to me. I don't think she had a choice and I think she knew it. She could see her entire arc and how things from the ""future"" intertwined with the ""past"" but she couldn't bend that arc into anything else but what it was.",5cc7fb
d9vzc1u,"Yes, at the end of the movie Amy Adams starts to understand her perception of time as a loop - her mind has started to connect to her past and future.  So the first scenes with her daughter actually happened after the aliens left, but she know sees her future and knows her daughter's fate even before conceiving the child.  She goes ahead and has her anyway because 'life's about the journey, not the destination'.  She chooses to have the daughter knowing that she will die very young because she sees that the 14 or so years of life and love is worth the pain when she inevitably dies.

d9wydqo,"Here's kind of how I think of it in the movie:

Time does not involve causality at all. You only perceive all of your time at once, but because of this you do not actually perform any actions willingly. You can only perceive them happening by experiencing different instants in time. This would also assume that ""consciousness"" is tied to an infinite number of instances of yourself, one for each infinitely narrow slice of time over the course of your life. This would imply you just don't have free will, and your existence is an immutable sequence of actions woven with others that make up the timeline of the universe. Disturbingly, this would also mean that everything is simply set in stone forever because nothing can change but everything must still happen.

The reason I think the movie shows there's no free will is... Louise only perceived moments from one timeline. I don't understand how time could possibly be linear if someone can experience past, present and future at once. If they can experience the future, then what future is it that's perceived? In a year's time, any choice that anyone makes along the way could change the future experience of a person.

So in the movie, Shang and Louise's past, present, and future selves were all defined ""at all times"". Shang was always telling Louise his private number, and Louise was always telling him his wife's dying words. They both always knew these pieces of information in every instant of time, but needed the alien language to reveal them.

The tricky thing here is then ""Why did the aliens go to earth to get help from humans 3000 years in the future if there's no free will?"". And the answer would be sort of... they didn't choose to go there. They just existed there at that point in time. Humanity in the future has always had the language because the aliens were always there in the present.

Abbott, the heptapod alien, knew that it would be killed by C4 but didn't stop it because the heptapods experience all of time at once. From Costello's perspective, Costello could talk to Abbott whenever it wanted in the past, present or future. Abbott never actually goes away for Costello even if Abbott dies in that moment because Abbott experiences all of time.

In the future, Louise's daughter dies but Louise is okay with this because from Louise's perspective, she is with her daughter and with Ian at all times, no matter if she is in the past, present or future. 

In your dying in a car crash example, even at the moment that you get hit by another car, you wouldn't be alone. You would still be with your family, your friends, and your loved ones because you would be experiencing and reliving all of time, all the time, everything that had every happened to you and will happen to you. You might not have the same fear of death if you had this perspective.

What I'm saying is that if you just told me point blank that I was going to die in a car crash, I would probably avoid it and exercise my free will to stop that from happening. But if you made me experience all of my life, my entire beginning and end, all at once and all of the time, I might exercise my free will to go with fate because I wouldn't be afraid of death.

Interestingly some languages such as english had this distinction between singular (thou), dual (you two), plural (you), but then developed to not have this distinction in modern english.

dd88wcy,"Dude, you could not have missed the point more if you tried. Differing conceptions of time was one of the key exemplars utilised by one of the guys who created the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis that the movie explicitly cited. From Wikipedia:

>Whorf's most elaborate argument for linguistic relativity regarded what he believed to be a fundamental difference in the understanding of time as a conceptual category among the Hopi. He argued that in contrast to English and other SAE languages, Hopi does not treat the flow of time as a sequence of distinct, countable instances, like ""three days"" or ""five years,"" but rather as a single process and that consequently it has no nouns referring to units of time as SAE speakers understand them. He proposed that this view of time was fundamental to Hopi culture and explained certain Hopi behavioral patterns.

Now, there's debate over whether Whorf's depiction of the Hopi was accurate or not, and viewing time in that way doesn't magically grant you the ability to see the future, but the point is, it's not just something the writers of the film made up. It's based on a legitimate theory in linguistics that still has proponents today. Obviously the film took it a step farther, but you know, that's the ""fiction"" part of Science Fiction.",5cc7fb
d9wln5v,"I haven't read the book, so my feelings towards events only go as far as what was on screen.

-  I'm pretty sure the baby is human, from our two protagonists. We don't know if Louise is special after making physical contact was gas/glass/aliens. She might just have got the crash course and in a few months with specialized tutoring, gained the power of foresight. She goes on to write books and teach classes. I don't think that's just for how to read the language though, I think the goal is to share her gift with the whole species, eventually. Anyone learning from her though will have to study for years and years maybe. The other pods may have been hoping to get someone like her in each region, or simply trying in all regions because they had limited ""time"" to get it across and didn't want to waste effort if the first country they met attacked them or couldn't comprehend.

So they may have rushed to bestow some learning before the bomb, but I don't agree they were impregnating an alien species. They were planting seeds of knowledge, that after 3000 years should result in a species of super advanced humans, all fluent the language and time perception. If they studied us so closely that they knew how to successfully manipulate our reproduction systems, they probably could have learned our language first. In fact, if they can see the future and had any intention of learning our language they could have come to earth and written in English to start with. Instead they only wrote in their language, which had separate meaning from their vocal speech. Their writing/language really was the gift. The question still remains how we gift them back.

- Hannah probably is gifted. The first child to get lessons from birth from the most qualified teacher on the planet. No one learns language as well as a baby, and no child scores as well on tests as one who can catch glimpses of the future.

- What was the word used about Hannah's importance? She rejoiced at being called it and hugged her mom near the end. I can't remember, but I think it referred to how important Hannah was to her mom then, in her mom's past during the events of the movie, and therefore in the future with all the effects her mom causes. So since her daughter helped her learn to communicate with the aliens, her daughter was infinitely important, before her birth and after her death, no matter how short her actual life was. She's also eternally alive too from her mom's point of view.",5cc7fb

d9wuzbn,"When the Chinese General approaches her at the gala, he says something along the lines of ""i cant begin to comprehend how your mind works"", which would indicate to me that he does not understand the language himself - but understands the concept and gravity (haha) of it. I cant be sure of his motivation in telling her the info at the gala, as I forget the order in which we're presented information (interesting, as that is practically the theme of the whole movie). I have a few possibilities bouncing around in my brain: 1) she seems confused when he approaches her so he simply feels the need to explain. 2) he has some 6th sense that in this moment that is what he is meant to do and lastly 3) (the possibility I favor) it is his destiny to tell her that information. although she may know what has happened and what is to happen, she and everyone else are bound to their actions. she can not change what is to come - she must only accept it. this also ""lets her off the hook"" for having hannah, because she had no choice in the matter.

* *EDIT: A 4th possibility is there, but I reject it as I think it conflicts with the rest of the movie. I originally didn't include it because of this, but I'll address it and why I don't think it's consistent with the rest of the film. The fourth possibility is that 'after' the aliens leave, Louise writes a book, teaches classes, etc. where she could explain to people how events played out and therefore, the Chinese General would know that he has to tell her the information in order to save the world. However, the whole movie is based upon all things happening simultaneously, and for this fourth possibility to make sense, time would have to be linear, and they'd just be hopping back and forth. This introduces paradox, which you'll probably see others talking about in this thread, and as I've said, it's inconsistent with the circular idea of time.* *

I think it's objectively good, because it uses a bit of logic to set up the fantastic situation of aliens arriving without the immediate ability to communicate to discuss several difficult topics. 


The surface one is Free Will. Louise poses the question for the audience (""If you could see your whole life beginning to end, would you change anything?""), and leaves the discussion up to the audience. The film states her decision, and opens a morality discussion. 

However, Free Will is a side-effect of a different aspect of the universe - determinism. There are a few interpretations:

1) All events pre-determined. If so, Free Will is only an illusion, all time loops are closed, and the universe is simple. 

2) Only some events are pre-determined (this is the *Doctor Who* interpretation). Not really touching this one right now because it has endless debate possilibities and enables a lot of *deux ex machina* explanations for our stories. 

3) Nothing is pre-determined. The universe is random, the multiverse is real, and Free Will exists in full form. For ""Arrival,"" this makes the Heptapods description of their need of our help in 3000 years difficult to explain.

4) Different species experience the universe differently (variation of #2). Maybe since the Heptapods can see their future they're trapped by their perception of time, whereas our inability to see our future allows us to change it. So, they have a timeline that they're stuck on, and our non-deterministic flexibility allows us to help them adjust their track. 

So, this movie provides a popular basis for a discussion of determinism, the morality of the decision to embark on a journey despite knowing its terrible end, and what it would take for humanity to unite in a single, nonviolent effort. 

Also, you get a pretty novel alien design and very unique language. The cinematography is beautiful, Amy Adams was an excellent actress in her role as a female lead, and there's a twist that makes the viewers reinterpret not only the meaning of earlier scenes, but the order in which they occur. This also forces the viewers to change their interpretations of earlier scenes because they would have made assumptions about her character based on the assumed timeline of events. 

Yes, there are better Sci-Fi movies that have been made. But I believe this one is objectively good, and can go up in the pantheon of classics.

The movie is an example of a Godlike force communicating wisdom to a ""Chosen One."" Louise writes a book detailing how to communicate with the Heptapod. If humanity reads this, it would trigger the same awakening in them that happened to Louise. Humanity reading a book like this would radically change how we live our lives and construct society, and Louise would be seen by many as a holy prophet, akin to Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, take your pick.

And it is extremely presumptuous to assume that every person who believes that the good of existence outweighs the bad believes so because they have not experienced any bad. I could list the number of people close to me who have had cancer, the friend I have whose child died at the age of 2, or my own experiences with depression before having kids and PPD afterward. Sure, if I knew that my kids were going to experience extreme horrors in their life with no chance of happiness, then I wouldn't choose existence on them. But that's not what happened in this film.

There was so much joy, so much happiness and richness and the fullness of life. And every good moment existed always and forever just as the bad moments because with non-linear time, everything always is and always will be. The character of Louise knew her daughter would die, but she also knew just how much happiness there would be. And she accepted that. But there may have never been a choice to begin with. 

If I knew what she knew, and knew that my daughter would have the kind of life that Hannah in the film had, but ultimately she would die as a teenager, absolutely I would go forward. And I doubt Hannah herself would have chosen non-existence.

dat0obf,"I am not sure what this means:
>If you can do calculus you should also be able to do algebra since you need to use algebra to perform derivatives? 

Anyways, here is a conceptual example:  
So humans first find specks that make up a structure. They find one speck, which leads them to #2, and then to #3, then #4 reveals that speck #1 and #3 are related. As humans build the structure, they eventually begin to understand that the all specks are related to each other, but they have to find all the specks to find all the relationships. Aliens already see the entire structure, it's already there. Okay but how do humans get from speck #1 to #2 to #3? Why in that order? Oh I see, at first they didn't know that speck #1 and #3 are related. But it's pretty obvious....oh crap, I guess I have to get to their level to figure this out. Okay so there is speck #1, #2, #3 and #4. So let's start at speck #1 because humans say so. But speck #1 and speck #3 are clearly related....okay let's remove speck #2. Nope speck #1 and #3 are STILL related. Okay let's remove speck #4...oh! that's why they didn't know speck #1 and #3 are related at the beginning. They needed to see speck #4 to realize that #1 and #3 are related. But why not speck #1, #3, #4, then #2? Ah, they couldn't have found speck #3 if they didn't find speck #2 first. Got it. Lmao good luck on getting to speck #1295866.   
Okay, so imagine that the aliens are in all part of their lives at the same time (ie. Amy knowing that her daughter will die before the daughter is even born). So for us, we are at point A at any time, we are *not* at point A **AND** point B. Nor we at point A, point B, **AND** point C. We are **only** experiencing one point at a time (don't think about this in terms of time right now, that's hard to conceptualize since time is fluid, imagine this in terms of space-you're in Paris, but you can't be in Paris and London at the same time). Whereas the aliens are, they're at point A, point B, and point C. Goodness, they're on all the points of the spectrum.      
For aliens, I don't think that it is that they have no sense of time completely, it's just that they don't have a sense of linear time (they understand it though, as humans can conceptualize multiple dimensions but only experience one dimension).     
Okay let's look at the ball throwing example again. So for humans, the ball exists first at point A, and then it moves to point B (the idea is that the ball can only be at one place at any time). For aliens, the ball exists at point A and B (and C etc.). 
So for humans, we would calculate the distance where the ball is at the starts, and then where it ends. A to B. Pretty easy.  
For aliens, they already know where A and B is. So then by telling them to do linear algebra, you're asking them to pretend that they don't know where point B is, just completely ignore it, look only at point A and ""abstractly"" (which is linear for them) find an arrow to point B when it is obvious that point A and point B are on top of each other (same time). Well my alien homies, let's stop thinking of A and B as on top of each other and try to see it from humans' eyes. Okay so they think that A and B are in different positions, but how to they judge? Ah the two places are different for humans because it takes them different times to reach those places. But how do we find the different amounts of time when for us, it takes us ""no time"" at all? We need to somehow come up with something tangible out of something that we think of as intangible to understand.      
I hope I explained it right! If something doesn't make sense, let me know and I'll double check.

I think what is meant to be conveyed to the audience is the choice made by Amy's character to pursue (and thus ultimately experience) what she saw in her future despite there being profound hardship in the end.  That there is/would be value in having the experiences of love and raising her child even though she knows she will die (because otherwise she would experience none of those things if she avoided them entirely).  The question posed to Renner helps affirm to her that she will follow through on that future now that the choice seems validated by this person she has such a strong connection to.

That's my take anyway.  I generally reject the idea that we have no real choices.  We might be strongly influenced to stick with certain choices, but to deny choice entirely is inhuman.

I'm not sure if that phone conversation means he hadn't learned yet and just found out from her.. I guess that changes things if true..

I think that's the underlying discussion too.. you see her decision as being very self-serving, that she wanted to experience love she didn't mind knowing it would cause her and her child and her husband so much pain. 

I'm saying, I don't really see how that is different to anyone's life.. everyone meets a horrifying and painful end.. you and me, well both die painfully in a bed and aware that we're about to die.. most people (making assumptions based on you using reddit) pretty much all die from cancer or heart disease even when things go well for the first 70 years or so.. unless you're snuffed out unexpectedly by an accident or something.. so the only difference is the duration.. that seems to be what you're valuing here.",5cc7fb

dajc9el,"they touch on the idea near the beginning that by using different languages youre sort of being a different person, because of the way you think differently, the way different words are represented, different ideas, different connections between them. Like the Sanskrit word for ""war"". As Louise slowly grasped their language, it transformed her minds perception of time and she saw time in a non linear way that made her become aware of the inevitable. She lived that fate with that awareness, there was no ""choosing hannah"" because she has, had, and will always make that choice. The narrative of the movie was linear, but our perception of the timeline changes with Louise. She asks Jeremy Renners character something along the lines of ""would you still live your life even if you knew what was going to happen, would you change anything if you could?"" and he said ""id try to speak how I feel more"" or something. Its like a nod to Amor Fati, she had to live every day with that mindset, of living with that awareness. To say she was selfish to choose to have Hannah anyway is missing the point completely. This would imply the heptapods giving us their language just allows us to see a version of the future, and thus not actually time. It doesnt make sense if she can change it, if she can choose to not have hannah. Her visions and ""remembering the future"" would be pointless since they arent going to happen. So in the end, its just Louise coming to grips with the inevitable, and learning to be content with her existence. Can you imagine doing this alone, wading through this mindfuck?",5cc7fb

They view life in a non-linear way, so death isn't nearly as significant to them.

In the beginning, did you interpret Amy as just an all-around grim/dismal person *not* mourning the loss of her daughter, *not* ignoring the world around her because her daughter wasn't in it, *not* being brave because she had nothing left to lose since she'd already lost her daughter?

Because if you did, then there wasn't a twist in the film at all...",5cc7fb
d9xvt3p,"Yep and not only did it cheapen things, but by doing what they did, they forfeited a lot of emotional impact the daughter's death could've had later on in the film. If we started to realize *with* Amy that the little girl was her future daughter & Amy gets infused with the joy that comes along with it (thereby infusing the *audience* with an excitement and happiness for our protagonist's future), the point at which Amy realizes her daughter's gonna die by accessing that future moment once she can fully understand the language - it would've been devastating to Amy *and* the audience *and* we'd still be riveted watching Amy struggle through the grief while still needing to call Shiang & save/unify the whole world. 

Instead the daughter was just constantly overshadowed by the audience's knowledge she was gonna die even though Amy *didn't* for awhile... and at no point did we ever see Amy flip out with the discovery that her daughter was gonna die like you'd assume she would. Even for just a second flipping out and then slowly absorbing the rest of the language & the impact of nonlinear thought rolling over her grief & throwing her into some kind of stable peace would've been fine while the rest of the audience is still kinda devastated (lol). 

It would've also sharpened the heart-string chords when Amy comes to the conclusion she's still going to have the child.

There were a lot of ways this film far surpassed the film of a similar concept Sphere (1998), but it went wrong in this particular way. The writing/directing geared itself into a cheap lie of a twist instead of a riveting psychological & emotional mystery/thriller. If they hadn't included the twist and they'd followed Amy's perspective the whole way through, it would've been a lot better.

But also y'know the 'twist' could've been that the father was Jeremy Renner. If a third into the film, Amy starts *only* seeing her future daughter, then everything emotional/psychological could've still happened & been way more impacting than what the film delivered. The revelation that Jeremy Renner was the father could've been the *fair-play* twist. Edit: That's a little Disney though, so maybe I'd have her realize Jeremy Renner's her future husband *before* she can fully understand the language and instead gets a momentary flashforward while she's in the middle of thinking Renner's literally about to die & the flashforward is something about how she saved her husband's life once & it propels her to save Renner's life & *that's* her Eureka! moment...",5cc7fb
d9y0tar,">it gives the viewer a 1:1 understanding of Louise's experience of seeing something and not knowing what it means.

No; we were more messed up by the writer&director's intro than Louise ever was. Louise could only have been thinking 1 of 2 things when she started learning the language and getting flashes: 1) she's insane & hallucinating, and 2) these could be clues... to... the future? The future. Boom, done. 

Under no circumstances did Louise think she was seeing the past in those flashes. We *were* though, and that was a deliberate deception by the writing/directing. 

At no point did we ""put everything together *with her*"" -- we were putting everything together *without* her and recalling how the writer/director had fucked us up thinking those flashes were her past while she full-well knew all along that they *weren't* pieces of her past.

When she says, ""ask your father about science,"" it's quite clear who the father is. However, the movie isn't honest with itself in a way and treats this more like another clue, not the reveal.

da13u93,"Thank you! There are some libertarians (notably Robert Kane and Peter van Inwagen), but compatibilism is the more popular position. As the [PhilPapers survey results](http://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl?affil=All+respondents&areas0=0&areas_max=1&grain=coarse) suggest: of the 3,226 participants, 51.5% accepted or lean toward *compatibilism*, 18.3% accepted or lean toward *libertarianism*, 15.2% accept or lean toward *no free will*, and 15.0% chose ‚Äòother‚Äô. The discrepancy between libertarianism and no free will is quite interesting. I would have expected ‚Äòno free will‚Äô to be a much more popular position! I think on an everyday, common-sense level, libertarianism is the most intuitive of all the positions; we all live as if we have this radical kind of free will, and it is only when one finds themselves in the philosophy classroom (or on this thread), that they begin to question if they may be mistaken.

You make a good point, there really appears to be no ‚Äòdriving force‚Äô that *makes* you adhere to the predetermined timeline. In Arrival, Louise comes to know certain 'facts' about the future, and yet, because she knows these 'facts', surely it is in her power to act in such a way that the 'facts' do not obtain. She‚Äôs perfectly healthy, she‚Äôs a sharp thinker, and she has all the knowledge required it seems, to prevent one of those future glimpses from becoming true. She could presumably lock herself in a room and sit silently for 24-hours until it all passes. Although all these 'facts' about her abilities and what she can ordinarily do are overruled by the further fact that logical contradictions cannot obtain, where she both does something, yet doesn‚Äôt do it (if we take her to have genuine knowledge about the future). The reason this seems strange is because there is nothing in our experience like this. The laws of logic must be obeyed by the laws of physics, but not vice versa. (There is a good discussion of this idea in relation to time travel in David Lewis‚Äô paper ‚Äò[The Paradoxes of Time Travel](http://www.csus.edu/indiv/m/merlinos/paradoxes%20of%20time%20travel.pdf)‚Äô.)

There seems to be four potential explanations on offer:

1. Louise cannot act counter to her ‚Äòmemories‚Äô of the future, and no matter what she tries to do, they will come true: they are knowledge.
2. Louise can act counter to her ‚Äòmemories‚Äô of the future, and these ‚Äòmemories‚Äô are not knowledge, and perhaps only express *possible* futures: they're probabilistic.
3. Louise can act counter to her ‚Äòmemories‚Äô of the future, but they are merely knowledge of what happens in *some* timeline or world, and if she does not act in accordance with them, she finds herself on another branch where they turn out false.
4. Contradictions exist, and she both does and does not act according to her ‚Äòmemories‚Äô of the future on the same timeline, in the same world.

(Options 2. and 3. are not mutually exclusive)

Option ‚Äò4.‚Äô is out of the question. Option ‚Äò2.‚Äô seems coherent, but in the course of the movie, there‚Äôs no evidence provided that would support it; she only ever does that which is consistent with her ‚Äòmemories‚Äô of the future. The same is also true for option ‚Äò3.‚Äô I believe option ‚Äò1.‚Äô is the most likely. Based on all that happens in the movie, it seems like her daughter‚Äôs death and her divorce with Ian are inevitable. Option '1.' takes seriously the idea that Louise begins to view time non-linearly, and therefore she‚Äôs never really existing at a point where she could make decisions to alter the future, because it already exists, as do all points in time. This is what I think the Heptapods meant by ‚Äòthere is no time,‚Äô the passage of time is illusory. Time is not some dynamic process, it is something static, like a movie reel, which produces in us the perception of motion.

db67c0z,">The only definition of free will is that each moment is an intersection with infinite possibilities and ***you* actively pick one through action or inaction**.

That's incoherent as a definition of free will because if you pick one of infinite possibilities (or choose not to) then it means that you are causing or determining which possibility obtains via your choice (which is in turn determined by other factors such as your beliefs and desires). This is exactly why the compatibilist's definition is superior because it acknowledges that free will is only possible *because* of determinism. Indeterminism does not gives you any free will, as it replaces causation with genuine randomness and unpredictability.

There is literally nothing more palatable about compatiblism either. Compatiblists agree completely with almost everything hard determinists say: determinism is true, libertarian free will is nomologically impossible.

d9x1uop,"This is an interesting take on it!

I think you may be right concerning the film.

I am still open to the possibility that Louise does not know that she cannot actually change the course of events. Everything she does in the film is totally consistent with her visions of the future. If she did not exercise her ability to call the Chinese general she would not have had visions of the future, because presumably destruction or some other fate would have taken place. Even if she knows what is going to happen, she still needs to make the choices when they happen from the present perspective.

Another thing that's interesting is Louise is sort of a bridge between humans and Heptapods in the sense that she's torn between both modes of existence. She only has partial control of her ability, and develops it more toward the end of the film. So this makes it quite difficult to understand what full Heptapod existence would seem like, given that they probably value the presentist perspective even less so.",5cc7fb

Once an OPORD is given, the situation may change before the mission begins, or, during the operation the situation may change so that the base order must be modified.

I am not trying to disprove this exact theory but attempt to explain how absolutely incorrect it is to assume that they don't understand math. Whether the director specifically wanted them to not understand math or not, it's just wrong. It doesn't make sense, and I hate it. 

Now, for the theory. I'd say that since they understand the linear flow of the human sentence structure, that although they have a non-linear understanding of time, that they can still perceive things linearly, just as Amy Adams did during her flashbacks (flashforwards?) The General didn't first show her his cell phone and then whisper the wife's dying words and then say hello. Nor did he whisper the dying words, say hello and then show her the cell phone. So, although time isn't perceived linearly, the packets of time are. So an algebraic equation or polynomial function would be perceived normally as well. If we assume that they wouldn't be able to understand algebra then we also assume that we can't teach them algebra, because they are unable to perceive it as we do. So, they would be unable to learn our language, unable to learn algebra, etc. We also must assume that the ships they are in are not alien built and are somehow just out in the universe, and that they can manipulate gravity without knowing the math behind gravity. This creates too many issues within the story.

It may be the directors intent to have the aliens not have any form of math, but it doesn't fit, and the whole idea is wrong. I'm hoping to educate the people on this thread about how wrong the entire thing is. Every civilization since the beginning of time has had a form of math.

The general situation can never happen in a linear time life or a non linear already written time line scenario.

It could only happen on a timeline which was modifiable and therefore in my opinion renders the whole thing erroneous.

You cant arrive at the future general conversation if you didn't call in the past but you cant call in the past if you didn't MODIFY the future. Can we agree so far?

So therefore being able to modify any part of time makes this erroneous because if everyone and not just Louise kept modifying things then the world would be like changing all the time it would be some fucked up reality where everything just keeps changing out of control.

The hectapod accepted its fate just like Louise accepted the child because supposedly you cannot change the outcome of the ability to perceive in a non linear way which the real definition of this would be like having a written book of your whole life and living it all at the same time.

She's a linguist, a specialist in languages and understanding them. She's presumably in her mid 30s or so, and the movie hints at up to 12 years beyond that considering the lifespan of her child. She'd be dead in maybe another 20-30 years. How many people could she successfully teach in this time by herself? How many would they then teach before she dies, if at all? Of the people she interacts with directly, how many would even want to learn the language? It's simply outside the scope of the movie to show these sorts of knock on effects, and it's not unreasonable to think that they wouldn't have had any effect on her life as we saw it at all. So is there no one else who understands it? While the aliens are around, probably not. And just because one perceives time non-linearly doesn't mean they can change their past as they might yet change their future.

Unless you're actually asking why none of the other nations had someone who perceived time non-linearly as a result of learning the language. It's clear they had people who learned some of it well enough to communicate at a basic level, but given what happens to her, no one would understand it as fully as she did. It's likely she was the only person even capable of understanding and learning it that quickly. Also there's no way to say that others didn't start having visions, but none likely had the knowledge necessary to realise they were seeing the future - nor is it certain that their future visions would have been at all relevant to the present events anyway.

Maybe their relationship would have had more weight if his character had more importance to their assignment or showed some sort of insight or some passion in his field (what did he do apart from hold her equipment?) he was so poorly fleshed out as a lead. There was almost no chemistry between them and no reason to like him.

This film has been compared to 2001, but there was no bullshit sentimentality in Kubrik's masterpiece.

del1d76,"Over the course of the movie, various themes to me felt cliche since they've been used time and time again. 

War and unity, reading the future, preventing tragedy, conflict with aliens, time loops, and so on. There's a lot more to the list, but I can't think of them off the top of my head. 

It felt like I was watching something similar to Interstellar, but with a different storyline. The movie gradually made it obvious that she was seeing visions into the future, and Ian gave the most obvious scripted hint by telling the viewers that learning a language means becoming it. 

It felt like a surprise that wasn't much of a surprise anymore; like being given spoilers. Expect in this case, the MC gives it to you. There wasn't much figuring out to do, which reduced the immersion and felt like I was just watching the events happen. 

If we take a movie like Predestination, you don't know about the time loop until it's suddenly revealed to you, and then you go ""Woah... Damn."" In this movie, it's just revealed plain to you and you don't really get that surprise factor. You just go, ""Oh, I know what's going on now. I know what she'll do."" See the difference?

In any case, as I mentioned, I'm probably just desensitized to the whole time loop thing, so I expect a shock or surprise factor to make it meaningful instead of just a generic plot device. ",5cc7fb

We as humans define what time is, and everyone follows suit and believes there to be no alternative interpretation of it.

The aliens come to show Louise that there is another way to look at time, which she is unable to perceive easily as she *believes* that time and language are independent of each other.

In reality, to the aliens, they are one and the same, so the aliens attempt to show her ""visions"" that try to portray messages (language) via precognition (time).

That's a good way to look at the movie, I suppose. And a lot easier to comprehend. Thanks :P

db57zac,"> Let's do a thought experiment. ...

If it's something as intimate as marriage and having a child, them abusing your ignorance would be unethical. 

If your fiance says ""I will only marry you if you ___"" and you are not blank or did not do blank or have blank. And you lie. And they find out later. Is that ethical? You knew their wishes. But you manipulated them knowing this. And you harmed them.

Louise knows Ian's wishes even without an a priori question or statement, she sees his response when she is eventually honest with him. 

I don't see this as any different than one fiance defrauding the other. Having an affair before the marriage. Being married already and covering it up. Being gay or otherwise unattracted but claiming otherwise, presumably marrying for reasons of money or other. 

Your thought experiment is lacking specifics we have in the film.  If your friend is embarrassed because they crapped their pants but this does no harm to you, then no, there's not much reason they need to tell you they remembered crapping their pants.  But if your friend did something with you that could change your life substantially, there's not much justification for not telling them. 

We had sex and I could be pregnant.  Not something you should hide.
You agreed to be my drug mule and now have an abdomen full of narcotics wrapped in balloons.  Not something that you should hide. 
You told me a secret and I'm going to benefit from it at your expense in the future.  Not really ethical.

Is it ethical to rape someone who is unconscious?  Even if they won't remember? Even if they wouldn't have any idea it happened? If they weren't harmed otherwise?  

Louise is even worse in this regard because she eventually does tell him. Even though it destroys him.  That's more like raping someone who is unconscious and then telling them about it later because it makes you feel better to get it off your chest even though you took advantage of them by doing it in the first place and then harmed them by letting them know when they were ""blissfully unaware."" 

> it was her future she was seeing

It was BOTH of their futures. She can't have the marriage or the kid all by herself. It's not solely her property. She's a fraud.

>but those memories aren't his.

But some of them absolutely are his future-memories. 

Abortion rhetoric has women thinking that children are 100% their prerogative. And current laws do favor them. But I suspect there's room for more equitable treatment. For instance, women basically have control over both parental rights. They can deny a man access to a child he would want as well as encumber him with responsibility for a child he does not want. 

Let's flip the tables on Louise. Let's say she wants children and she tells Ian this. They agree to marry under the knowledge they both want children. But he doesn't want children.  He gets a vasectomy.  Lies to her about it until 15 years later. She's passed her child bearing years and he admits that he lied every time ""they were trying for a kid.""

Would we not say that Ian extracted marriage and sex out of Louise under the fraudulent agreement that they wanted kids?  ",5cc7fb

Except it's not just a consequence of seeing non-linearly. It's just an arbitrarily inserted paradox.  See, Louise could have just gotten non-linear awareness. Pretend you have it now. You can see the past and the future. But that in no way creates any sort of causal loop, boostrap paradox the likes of which we see.

We might create a sort of loop where you play lotto all the time and one time you see yourself win, so you know what numbers you chose. But that doesn't necessitate you know the numbers before hand. That's merely gaining information from the future.

But the film creates a paradox and it's really poorly written. Louise doesn't think it in to existence, she doesn't plan for it and make it happen. Rather it just happens for no reason at all. Not only is it bootstrapped, it's bootstrapped for no logical reason.  Consider the difference between the Chinese general for no reason showing her his phone and telling her what he said with a case like Dr. Genius writes a schematic for a time machine by studying a time machine which he travels back in time with and shows to his former self.

dekhl7z,"> movies can mean different things to different people

How deep in to subjective nonsense do you want to wade?  Anything can mean anything. So what?  There are objective facts that were displayed on screen. They did not, in fact, show what you're claiming. 

At no time did anyone, let alone Louise, experience her life all at once.  That vast majority of the film was linear. And she experienced it linearly.  She had a few moments where she had flashes that were premonitions.  But we did not see a collapse of time, just a few instances where she had visions of different times.

Not once, ever, did we see her actually experiencing a different time, either. All we saw was her having visions, in her head.  Not one point in the film was she experiencing duality in time, let alone all of time or her life, at once.

> it does show us that theres no present, because it no longer exist.

Film never shows this. There's very clearly the present. We watch it for 90% of the film. There are flashes of other time periods and some voice over crap that talks about other points in time.  But the film we see is mostly running linearly and sequentially. 

> your retarded assumption is that she decides to do everything exactly the same again, thats ust retarded.

It's obvious that grammar and spelling and usage are not your strong points, but clearly you also have trouble with reading comprehension.  I didn't state what you just claimed, so it's rather pointless to respond to it as if I did. 

She doesn't do anything again. She's not in a loop.  She doesn't live her life twice.  The question is if she has agency or not, free will or not.  She lives her life linearly.  She is born, she lives, she dies. Just like her daughter.  They don't experience life all at once. They don't experience it again.  The audience is just shown flash backs and flash forwards.  This is not time travel.  It's a literary technique for story telling.

The issue at hand is does Louise have the ability to be an active participant in her life despite what she sees happening in a few, brief, and incomplete visions of her future?  

The way the film presents it, it is ambiguous, she either CHOOSES to act the same way she sees in her prophetic visions, or she has no choice and must act that way in a deterministic fashion. 

Both are problematic for reasons I stated elsewhere.

> also today in REAL LIFE we can experience our bad memories again and again by just remembering them or they can haunt use forever. 

Forgetting is a gift. Many people intentionally forget, or try to forget, painful things.  Ever heard of alcohol?  Most people don't drink because they like the taste. lol.  

Repressing memories, avoiding memories and the consequences of bad experiences are a major part of the human condition.  Many people are HAUNTED by their past.  And that's with the ability to forget.  The ability to create false memories, to alter the painful ones, etc.

But with her, she doesn't have that gift. Her visions were all perfect. No ability to repress or forget. 

Black Mirror has a fantastic episode on this topic where a man drives himself insane because he has eye implants that allow him to play back his past in perfect clarity and he fixates on things playing them again and again.  Much better handling of the subject than the stupid happy veneer that Arrival tries to apply to what is justly a horrific condition.

For example, one of the lesser armed countries could have had a more militant response and the US could have talked about how this was due to fear and that the US would send troops and supplies to bolster he confidence of the other nation and prevent them from being antagonistic. Or it could have been made clear that there was something very important the ships had to offer and a fear between russia and the US about who would get it first and how they would use it. Or it would have been interesting showing how all twelve nations were choosing to interact with the UFO and aliens - what machine did they use to climb up, how did they try to communicte, what people did they send into talk on behalf of their nation.

That's kind of how it is with time. We can only imagine it going in one direction (like being able to move only 1 limb at a time).

We should've been there to discover that little girl she's seeing? She's not insane: that's her future daughter. Those flashes of joy and happiness? That's her interacting with her future daughter. The audience would be moved and excited for our protagonist's future happiness. 

And when Louise finally learns the language completely and discovers that her daughter will die young? We will be as devastated as her and yet roiling in other nonlinear flashes that bulldoze over that grief and makes Louise realize she's gotta call Shang and save/unify the world *right now.*

Her choice to go through with coupling with Ian and having a cancer-doomed-baby? The impact of that would've been way more intense if we, the audience, had just experienced Louise's journey in a linear fashion because newsflash: the audience doesn't think in a non-linear fashion and so things aren't as emotionally impacting to us if they're nonlinear compared to linear. 

And that's not even talking about the BS code-switching the directors/writers did to us to fabricate a cheap 'twist' that her daughter wasn't a flashback but rather a forward-flash. The audience - we were the *only ones* that thought it was a flashback during the story (no other characters including Louise thought it could be a flashback; she sure as hell knows she's never had at daughter at that point in time)... and it was only until Louise said 'who's that little girl' that made it explicitly clear that the director/writer had just been messing with *us* and *us only* with that intro with the flashes and narration.

Ian asks Louise at one point if she's dreaming in the heptapods' language. It is at this point when the visions intensify and increase in frequency.

When Louise starts the visions, she's reached the point where she's immersed herself so much in their language she has begun to think in their mindset, i.e. non-linearly.

She knew if she had the child, it would die because of the disease; however, she still chose to have the child at the end of the movie. She is experiencing its death and its birth and its life all at the same time. I infer that is how she experiences her whole life and is why she said ""I'd forgotten how good it felt to be held by you"" which would have made no sense to Donnelly at the time, but it was obviously her experiencing that as the same time as experiencing what it was like to live after he left her. God the circular thinking is a mindfuck and I love it.

I think that the movie was advocating determinism because who would logically decide to have the child if they knew the coming heartbreak of its eventual death. But then, there's obviously at least other realities (not sure if that's the right word here, but it fits) where she didn't speak with Shang and maybe didn't have the child.

Shang just gave it to her with no request from her; (thinking out loud) however, he acted like he was in on it even though she had no idea what was going on. This could mean he was seeing time non-linearly as well at that point and maybe that's why he gave it so freely.

The meeting doesn't start out that way though. It starts more ""So you are the person who knows how to convince me of things. Oh, by the way, here's how to do that 18 months ago, wink.""

No our friends - they travel like a ""poof"". Because they can do much more then just see the future. So the travel breaks the time-space continuum, since they travel back and forward in time to change it. Realities die, new are created.

- they did not use FTL

- non-linear means that you don't see time as we do. You can be anywhere in the timeline. Hence quick travel

- that is the essence of the story and the movie - would you have a kid if you knew it dies first?

Check out the PBS Space series on Youtube - it's about quantum mechanics, non-linear time and casuality. This skews my mind here, and Ted Chang was probably not aware of that.

ddxouxi,"No, she still made choices in order to act out the future. Unfortunately the movie doesn't really explore the concept of sequential vs simultaneous consciousness as the novella does. Here are some excerpts of the novella: 

> The existence of free will meant that we couldn't know the future. And we knew free will existed becasue we had direct experience of it. Volition was an intrinsic part of consciousness.

> Or was it? What if the experience of knowing the future changed a person? What if it evoked a sense of urgency, a sense of obligation to act precisely as she knew she would?

Another spot:

> The heptapods are neither free nor bound as we understand those concepts; they don't act according to their will, nor are they helpless automations. What distinguishes the heptapods' mode of awareness is not just that their actions coincide with history's events; it is also that their motives coincide with history's purposes. They act to create the future, to enact chronology.

> Freedom isn't an illusion; it's perfectly real in the context of sequential consciousness. Within the context of simultaneous consciousness, freedom is not meaningful, but neither is coercion; it's simply a different context, no more or less valid than the other. It's like that famous optical illusion, the drawing of either an elegant young woman, face turned away from the viewer, or a wart-nosed crone, chin tucked down on her chest. There's no 'correct' interpretation; both are equally valid. But you can't see both at the same time. 

> Similarly, knowledge of the future was incompatible with free will. What made it possible for me to exercise freedom of choice also made it impossible for me to know the future. Conversely, now that I know the future, I would never act contrary to that future, including telling others what I know: those who know the future don't talk about it. 

So she does have choice in the matter. It's just her memory of the past, present and future that is non-linear. Her acting out of that memory happens in linear fashion. Thus her free will is exercised by her choosing not to affect the outcome of events.",5cc7fb

I think part of Ian not accepting it was also maybe because he hadnt learned the language yet (he coudlnt see the future, louise had to tell him about the child dying) so time to him was not linear, but to her it was so it affected her different?

daepz1b,"Yea I do see some of my statements are incoherent. Wrote it in a rage.
First of all, the aliens do not seem to possess any visual reception (eyes). It is hard to argue that the alien can distinguish boards from human body. The approach to start writing something and expect to explain it does not really work. This is similar to why you cant teach dogs or cats from showing them picture of words alone. And if they are fish-like, we have no idea how they perceive images. So going in with that is a big leap of faith with no scientific backgrounds.

At the end of the movie, Amy Adams tried to teach the language to everyone in the world. That is the main point. The alien needs our help, and it can only be achieved if human can use this language. Using this language, we can see the future. Therefore, humanity, with such diversity, when we can see the future, some will definitely try to change it. This also agrees with the point about free choices and future. If the alien knew that one of them will die explaining the stuff, and they still do it, it is their choice. However, in human context, it is hard to say you will still do it knowing you will die. Especially since this is all about miscommunication. Presumably, since the alien knew in the future, human will work with them, they should understand human's languages. Therefore, that death is totally avoidable, and by accepting that, we surrendered our free choice for the sake of getting things done. ",5cc7fb

d9yyrgc,"A lot of interesting ideas. I'm not sure I understand your Radial Time theory but it seems like quite a different way of looking at it. 

I'm interpreting a lot of these events from the point of view that their universe is deterministic, and therefore any information gleaned from the future has already been affected by the results of retrieving that information, hence they're all closed time loops (just like their sentences).

The Radial Time idea might allow for a non-deterministic universe, but you'll have to flesh that out. 


",5cc7fb
d9yvkmk,"These are all very good points, but you have to look at it from an outsider's point of view. 

I think everyone would find it very hard to believe that just learning heptapod would unlock the ability to see into the future (just look at the response to this movie!). I know biologists learn latin, but do any of them actually go through the effort of learning how to converse in it? I imagine it would take years of total immersion, and even then it would be very difficult. 

We can't write heptapod with our hands and we can't speak it, so it has no application outside of ""hey, if you can think in this language you can see the future."" How would you practice it? There aren't any heptapods to talk to. Even if you learn to read it and write it, what if being able to read the logograms and being fluent enough to unlock time are two very different things? 

Also, you're assuming Louise would tell people that the language unlocks the ability to see the future. Maybe she realizes that while knowing the future would advance science immeasurably, it would also completely destroy the human experience. Maybe she's just interested in living her life, and not being the focus of physical and medical science for the rest of her life as people try to understand how she can see the future. 
",5cc7fb
d9ywlgj,"I imagine being able to see the future of knowledge would be like being given a textbook of information in a subject you barely understand. Sure, it's all there, but you (in present day) still have to go through the effort of understanding it, and as you understand your future memories better, you eventually get to the point in the future where you understand the information, and that level of understanding is what you're accessing in the past. I think it's like how you can remember the act of studying in school and sitting in lectures, but the understanding is a separate thing.

Well, since the Heptapods can all see the future (we don't know how long they live, but their offspring would be able to pass back knowledge of their future lives once they learn the language, and I imagine something like needing an alien race's help would be worth passing back 3000 years), what they do in the present works out for them in the future. They don't know what happens in the meantime on Earth, but they know that they give us their language in 12 parts, and 3000 years later we help them out. 

4) The idea of a non-linear understanding of time can be really hard to wrap your head around. The same idea is present in *Slaughterhouse 5*, which I highly suggest reading if you haven't already. 

The idea of time ""travel"" is a common sci-fi trope, but non-linear time perception is less common since it's such a difficult concept. In the former you're going into the future or past but just jumping around a time line and then moving forward in whatever period you're in, but in the latter you can ""remember"" the future in the exact same way you ""remember"" the past. In that sense, you can ""travel"" to your past by remembering those events, and also ""travel"" to your future by ""remembering"" future events. 

It only really logically works if you assume a deterministic universe with closed time loops. If someone who can see the future can change the future, that leads to all sorts of time-travel fuckery that has plagued many, many stories that use it.

da21t67,"There is no path without the phone call. It's best not to view it as a ""path"" though, since that's a linear way of viewing time. And the driving point of the movie requires you to attempt to conceive of time non-linearly. If the viewer can only view things with a linear perspective of time, then you're right, things fall flat and don't seem to work. But it's when you broaden your perspective and attempt to understand time as a continuum, a spectrum rather than only existing for us at the present moment, that things begin to make more sense and seem possible. This might be a crappy analogy, but think of ""non-linear time"" like a video tape of a movie you've already watched. A video tape of a movie simultaneously has all parts of it at the same time; the beginning of the movie, the middle, and the end are all right there in the video tape. You could, if you wanted, look at the end, then the middle, then the beginning, then back to the end, back the beginning, back to the middle... you can do whatever you want with it because it's all there. But the only way we humans can understand it is by moving through time with each moment chronologically from beginning to end. But learning the alien language allows Amy Adams to understand her life non-linearly. She can just fast forward to parts of her life. Because that moment where the General shows his phone number to her exists (even though it's ""in the future""), it allows for the other moments preceding it to exist. It's odd to think about it like that since our notion of cause and effect usually moves from the present to the future, but in this case, when life is understood non-linearly, cause and effect moves in all directions. Everything is cause and everything is effect. In a sense, neither one exists. Everything just IS. ",5cc7fb

I believe that the implication was that having Hannah was the wrong choice, choosing a relationship when she already knew how it would all end. Although it's possible that there never was any choice in the matter, and she was going to have Hannah with Ian no matter what. I'm still confused on how her consciousness works, can she travel through her past and present, is she consciously experiencing everything from her life all at once, or does she still live in the current moment but it's possible for her to view her past and present? The fact that she didn't know what the general had said to her until he told her suggests it's all happening at the same time, past, present, future, which would mean there is no actual choice, and that everything that will happen has happened and there is no changing the future, but then it wouldn't really make sense for Ian to be mad at her since that sort of implies there is also no free will.",5cc7fb

Essentially, no. The future that you would know of - it's the same future where you act upon the future information you have.",5cc7fb
d9wce9y,"The movie makes it clear that Ian left when Louise told him about the future. Theres a lot that can be extrapolated there, the main ones being that she knew the whole time and that she kept it from him and just the sheer horror of learning that your kid is doomed. 

Aids and the death of the child being the ""secret"". Both of them would affect ian, it was just meant as a hypothetical. I see your point about not not doing something because it's not forever. I just have a problem with her keeping important information from Ian like that. He didn't know their future, he didn't have the benefit of an informed decision. Saying they can't affect the future makes no sense. We saw that she was the reason earth united, and in that vision she learned the phone number that would then allow her to cause said unity by calling the general. She was given a vision and the means to pursue it, but it was still her choice to follow through and realize it. She could have chosen to not pursue a romance with Ian, and it would absolutely have changed the future. Seems like a pretty nice power to have a screening for any potential decisions you make. I understand why he'd leave. It put him in an extremely tough position. Seeing your own child everyday knowing the exact day they're going to die. Maybe he got over it with time and learned to value the time he did have with her, they don't show it but I like to assume it got better for him. I still think it's just a scummy move on Louise's part. She got to choose knowing the stakes, he didn't. No one wants to assume their future will hold bad things, but she knew and withheld. I know I'm being really cynical about this, it just rubbed me the wrong way. ",5cc7fb
d9wvjmp,"I didn't read the story, I saw the movie though. If this is the case then I gotta say I don't think they reflected those ideas clearly enough in the film. She was experiencing the visions of her daughter from the beginning of the film, ""before"" she learned the language. The thing about high concept ideas, especially time and paradox stuff is that you need to establish really clear rules, even if it's not described to the characters clearly, it needs to read to the viewer clearly. Films exist in a linear time world, you gotta help bridge that gap if you want people to understand. Jumping from the central plot to other times was neat to discover that was the future all happening at once. But it's kinda treading on the idea that she doesn't really have any free will then. But like I said she obviously has the ability to tell information taken from other times to people in other times. Saying she can't affect how things are, then having scenes like the one with the general spelling out to her how exactly she could change the past seemed so on the nose I couldn't even tell if that was actually future/reality or if it was just in her head. No one talks like that ""oh remember that thing, that incredibly important thing you told me, here I'll tell you. Also here's my phone number."" did he have powers too?
like why did he do that? If that's real, then it's just really poorly done. It didn't feel earned. This is where the rules start to get weird and the logic the film tried to set up lost me at the end. ",5cc7fb
d9wzz5f,"I saw the forest in theaters. I came here to talk about the trees. So far I've gotten a mix of thoughts from other users ranging from 
1) She had no control over changing the outcome (and yet eventually she chooses to tell Ian, just not up front, which was my initial issue with her. Not to mention that weird talk with the general where he literally hands her a solution to her plot in the phone) 
2) It was better explained in the short story how the non linear time stuff works. Which is great and all, but this is a discussion about the movie.

There is one flaw I've seen though considering all the things I've taken in here. That she knows the stakes and what's to come but accepts it anyway is hailed as a beautiful acceptance of life in both its joys and sorrows. The ""you can't stop living because you're afraid of dying"" idea. The other folks here have made it clear over and over that she has no control over the outcome. So to suggest it's beautiful that Louise accepts the outcome even thought she knows the ending because love prevails and all that... it's flawed because that suggests she made a choice. According to the rules I've been told, she had no choice BUT to accept the future. If anything that changes my perspective of her character from being strong to just being tragic. If that was the intention of the creators then I buy that more, maybe I just read it wrong. ",5cc7fb
ddfmy3h,"If someone's kid dies in an accident and you ask them if they would prefer their kid to have lived or never have had them, they're almost certainly going to choose life.

But let's not pretend that's what happens here. If we used the same analogy, it's like if any Adams' character gave her daughter her car keys knowing she would get into an accident that takes her life. 

By everyone's standards the future is unprevebtable, and she has just as much choice conceiving her daughter with Ian as she would giving her the method of her own death, according to what everyone's been saying here. 

If she tells Ian hey our daughter is going to die in a car accident someday... he's probably going to react how we imagine he did in the movie. If she's saying that, then she's crazy. If she's right, then he's going to go through all sorts of stages of grief, betrayal, anger. 

I don't want to argue that a car accident is more preventable or not the same. The point is, it is the same promise of eventual death. And it's not just ""I'm afraid you might die in a car crash"", that's a legitimate concern... no this would be an actual premonition of the future. One she chose not to disclose to her partner. 

How is no one seeing that this is deceptive, cruel, and selfish. No one made her conceive her daughter. If it wasn't by choice, then she still had the knowledge of the death. She CHOSE to disclose that fact later in life after Ian had the daughter with her.",5cc7fb

They are powerless to live outside of that timeline because...""no cause and effect"". Humans on the other hand can decide not to go to the grocery store. And maybe by not going to the grocery store, the universe doesnt blow up. If you combine both the heptapods' and the humans' perspectives, you would not only see the universe was gonna blow up in 3000 years but also choose a path that doesn't lead to that end.

And on a more personal note. Are we to assume that the visions of future are limited to one's own perspective? Because couldnt Louise talk to a scientist in the future who finds a cure for her daughter's rare disease; assuming a cure is found in Louise's lifetime?",5cc7fb

> The way they wrapped up Ian's ending dropped this movie from an 8.5 to a 6.5 for me.

Don't forget, when the daughter is like 12ish (scene when she asks he mom what a win-win scenario is called), Louise casually says at the end of the conversation, ""Now that's a question you'll have to ask your father.""  

Earlier, when the kid was like 7-8, Louise told Hannah that Ian was dead.  Now he's alive when she's 12?

2 theories:

1. Louise told Hannah when she was young that her dad died (because he walked out and wasn't coming back).  Later, when Hannah's death year was approaching, somehow Ian came back into her life.  Louise didn't want to see him, but he still got visitation rights.  So Louise said, ""Now that's a question you'll have to ask your father [next time you see him].""  
1. Ian actually died, and Louise said that as a ""gonna have to go ask God when you see him"" kind of line.

Would you land on a potentially hostile planet with no method of protecting yourself other than a plain glass barrier? Especially if you already know that you will be attacked? It just seems odd to me that Abbott can hit the barrier hard enough with his ""hand"" to send Louise and Ian flying to safety, and it not suffer damage, but somehow the explosion not only destroyed it, but caused enough damage past that point to kill a massive floating alien.

I see where you're coming from that narratively it seems kind of cheap but I think the idea of showing us those emotional scenes right at the beginning and tricking us into thinking it was the past is to make us think about our own emotional response to what it would be like to suddenly see those life scenes without context and really understand the moral/emotional complexity of what being able to see your entire lifeline at once is like. Like we were more messed up so we can reflect on the ""power"" itself when thinking of the movie as a whole. It was more for the sake of the viewer than it being an actual 1:1 parallel with Louise's thought process like the poster above stated.


I'm a big Ted Chiang fan and maybe it comes across more in prose than it does on screen but I feel like they wanted to capture that same feeling you get from speculative fiction of really thinking through a ""what if it happened to me"" by having those emotional scenes thrown at you from the get-go and having them be more affecting to movie viewers even if it wasn't so for the characters themselves.",5cc7fb

I believe that she does not change the future in the movie because that is more satysfying for the audience - vision of the end world changed to the saving of the world would cause lesser effect on the audience later, when we see the death of her daughter. That is just a choice of Villneuve to make you think, that everything around you is unchangeable (or maybe to make Louise think that future is unchangeable).

But future has to be changeable - thats why aliens give us the GIFT.

..so maybe at this point Louise think, that she can not change the future - she huggs Renner and think that it is her destiny to marry him, have a daughter with him which will later die and then they will divorce. After years she realizes that she was wrong, she can change the future instead of only maintaining it. She can see her past.. everything what she could change but did not.. because she is older there is less future which she can change, her past is definitely unchangeable (daughter has died and Renner is for her also gone). 

The problem is the free will OR the knowledge of it - when she realized that she can change the future. Before the phonecall? After the phonecall? Before she decided to have a daughter or after??

After that memory with chinese general she knows, what to do to save the world and it is up to her if she is going to do that. Question is: is that a free choice or determinism - the phonecall and fact that the world is in her memories saved? IMO she can choose, because that is the purpose of the gift - see the future and prevent the destruction of humanity. The future memory of that party does not mean, that the world will be saved no matter what, because from that memory we know, that her action is necessary - that phonecall. Her choice (belief, desire) to call to the general saves the world - its not the determinism. Determinism follows her free choice of the phonecall.",5cc7fb

daam40b,"Respectfully, I think you are both misunderstanding the concept of simultaneity in the story. The heptapods can't *do* anything humans can't with respect to time. They *experience* time differently - in simultaneity. Costello can't go back in time to talk to Abbott. Rather, Costello sees Abbott's whole life as a state, not a sequence of events.

In other words, the heptapods don't experience ""going"" the way we do, sequentially. Being at location A ""and then"" at location B are just two elements of one moment to them.

Or to put it a third way: Humans experience three space-time dimensions in simultaneity and a fourth one in sequence. The fourth one is what we call time. What we call ""change"" or ""movement"" is difference in the first three dimensions as mapped on the fourth, which difference we experience sequentially because it's mapped on a dimension that we experience sequentially. But the heptapods experience all four of those dimensions in simultaneity, and don't have another dimension that they experience sequentially. They don't have sequential experience at all. So ""change"" and ""movement"" are meaningless to them. Our questions about free will would also be meaningless to them, because those questions are in terms of a particular ""now"" relative to which we classify certain regions along the fourth dimension as either ""future"" or ""past"". They have no such particular ""now"". It's all ""now"".",5cc7fb

Imagine reaching down and abducting a flatlander. He vanished from his world, but now he's at an angle where he looks down on flatland. He can see inside other people's houses all at once, where normally he'd only see the walls. He can even see inside the stomachs of his friends down there. He'd find it a strange but eye opening experience.

This movie seems to use time as the fourth dimension instead of another spacial dimension. So instead of seeing through walls and inside of people's stomachs, Amy Adams gains the ability to look forward and backward through time.",5cc7fb
d9zoq50,"> So the ship is a portal!?!?? and Amy Adams left this world and crossed to the next when she entered the ship! dam...

Nah, not quite: if you go with the theory that the heptapods are higher dimensional, then the ship is just the 3D result that you get from a 4D object with 3D space.

To illustrate this, if you out your finger into/""through"" 2D space, the 2D space residents would see a 2D cross-section of your finger.  
Now, going up a dimension, if you're 4 dimensional (for example) and you intersect something into the 3rd dimension, you're going to get a neat, 3D result-in this case, a ship.

Come to think of, maybe that's why there's no detectable transmissions between the ships? Because in a higher dimension, they would effectively able to effectively ""be in the same room"" as each other in the higher dimension-kind of like how you and your friends could all be playing Eve/WoW/Destiny etc in the same room in real life, but be in different parts of the game world.",5cc7fb

d9x785d,"We probably won't ever know that answer, but it was just my interpretation based on the fact that we didn't see the barrier after the explosion, and there was a constant theme in the movie about misunderstanding what the aliens were trying to say.



The only hint we have towards Abbott being unwell before the explosion is the fact that he was slow to arrive before the final meeting that they had. In a film with so much attention to detail this would more than likely not have been accidental, and I think makes everything more open for discussion about what actually occurred.

I imagine that the barrier was not ""glass"" in the way that we know it, considering that the aliens have superior technology and what appears to be total control over physics that we can't even understand. It would seem strange to me that the only thing sitting between them, and death is a simple layer of glass able to be destroyed by a c4 explosion that wasn't even immediately next to it.",5cc7fb

The only twist is under their language they could see SHE HAD ALREADY MADE IT, because the way they view time is the past/future/present all happening at once. 

It's how you still have free will in a closed universe. An even better way to think of it is this: if there is a God, he or she would not see linear time like us. They would see past/future/present all at once, as a dimension of its own, which means THEY ALREADY KNOW EVERYTHING YOU ARE GOING TO DO BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO DO IT. Because even though we are stuck looking at the universe through the keyhole of the present they are not.

ddi49a9,"> You have a major jump to conclusions assumption. You say they need humans help in 3000 years, then you jump to, there's no free will because of this. You just said a+b=c without giving what b is. Can you explain you logic here? I'm genuinely curious if you can.

I already did: the aliens say they will need human help in 3,000 years. They know this because time is not linear for them. Everything happens at the same time. They are experiencing what we perceive as 3,000 years from now, right this very moment. They ""remember"" the future just like we remember the past. Louise even says this at the very beginning of the movie. That's why they know what will happen 3,000 years *from a human's perspective* but is happening *now* for the heptapods.

If they could alter their future, then they wouldn't need our help. They could just avoid whatever they need help for.

The reason she asks her husband if he would avoid a path if he knew bad things would happen is up for discussion. Maybe she's validating that all of this is real. It does not in any shape or form mean she is able to alter the future - it has already happened according to the premise of the movie. Non-linear time. Past, present and future is all one. She can ""remember"" any point in time in her life, which has already happened.

I don't even know why it's a debate, the movie tells us this is exactly what happens.

> She could just have easily decided to not get with that guy, or not call that China guy. There's nothing forcing her to do those things

I think you're approaching it the wrong way. There is no future to alter. Past, present and future has already happened. The premise of the movie is that humans think time is linear: present is this very moment, past is what has already happened, and future is something we haven't experienced yet.

This movie says that heptapods don't think in linear time. they are not currently in the present. They are currently in past, present and future. They experience all three at this very moment. They ""remember"" all of them, equally.

Louise can't alter the future in this non-linear timeline because it has already happened. Her whole life has already happened. Her new state of thinking is her looking ""back"" on her entire life, which has already happened. She can interject herself at any point, but it's a memory, not an active life.",5cc7fb
ddini31,">You assume she can't see multiple futures, but we don't know that. That isn't even a point i was making, i don't care whether she has future options to choose from or not, but that her future isn't set in stone, and what I've stated towards that theory still stands unchallenged.

You failed to understand the movie. She doesn't really see the future, she remembers it. The reason she can see her daughter is because she has a daughter. The daughter isn't a vision of a possible future, it's a very real memory, or rather, a very real instant, it's not a flashback, nor a flashforward, she is living it. It doesn't mean she can't choose, but it means she already chose, the moment she learned the language, she started experiencing her life not in a linear fashion, but in a kind of fragmented way, which is why she seems weird even to her daughter, the moment the aliens departed occured to her right after the unification gala, which, in linear time, occured way later. This explains why she doesn't remember the general's phone number at the gala, or that she even called him, which, in your understanding, would be set in the future; it's because it's not her future at all, it's her present, she is literally repeating to the general during the alien crisis what the general is currently telling her at the gala.

Really, it‚Äôs not so much the incessant ruse of assigning profound meaning to the meaningless curios you decorate your sets with in your extraordinarily mundane fictions. It‚Äôs the (colossal) arrogance of the subtext: the province of human affairs is a field best left to dilettantes with an extraordinary gift for the feigning of paralysis. For saying nothing at all.

Louise still wanted to have Hannah because she already saw in the future how they loved each other and any other alternatives where Hannah wouldnt exist would be just unimaginable for her. She also said she will embrace the ending and that was really brave of her to make such a difficult decision.

Also the part where she calls general Shang is another example. She didnt know what to say to him but her future self knew what to. I believe this event was affected by those soldiers who made the stupid decision to bomb the spaceship. Had that not happened,  Louise would have understood her ability to see the future slowly but much clearly (instead of getting that crash course when she went up on the ship by herself) and know what she would say to the general. Or maybe this doesn't make sense and it is a time paradox. Maybe I'm just crazy.

Why would she be like that if not for her child? It seems to me as just a way for the writers to dupe you into her having some sort of ""trouble"" and thus character depth. Because other than that she was fairly flat.  

2) Depends on what the deal is etc etc. In any case if an alien wants to speak with us and teach us shit, given that they are able to master the non trivial fact of interstellar travel they should be reasonably able to at least make a translator beforehand. Its conceivable that they don't but mostly because it serves to further the plot. Imagine how contemporary humans would approach a civilisation that has been in contact with the western world. The answer is very carefully, and yes we would learn the basics of their language first.  

3) a mathematician will OBVIOUSLY be better at establishing patterns and figuring out codes of communication than a linguists, dude, thats obvious, a linguist is trained in human communication, he is near worthless in trying to figure out animal modes of communication much less an alien language that will most likely NOT follow the universal grammar human language uses.

So, there is no paradox; the scene with Shang doesn't technically happen in the future, everything (her entire life/time) is happening *now*. I think that's what they were trying to go for.

So, if we understand time in that way, she was never shown his number a second time, that scene was the first and only time she was shown his number and told his wife's last words. Her confusion is because she occupies time differently and didn't know in the ""future"" (quotations because to her it's all just ""now"") what she doesn't know right now. Once she can see her entire future she knows it all; she's not traveling in time, she's *experiencing* time differently.

I was actually seriously impressed with this movie. I thought it was going to be just another alien movie but it really wasn't and it used a concept I've always loved to consider; that (if they existed) aliens aren't just species from another planet but beings that have control or understanding of more dimensions than we do in a way that's baffling to consider.

There's a lot of philosophy of time in this movie. And what I got from it is that time isn't anything more than mode that humans use to perceive. The language the aliens taught allowed for the main character to perceive life without time. We are shown this in a way that looks like it's bouncing back and fourth along a timeline, but I think we're only shown that because how else can you show an audience timeless perception? Humans sort of are locked into perceiving the world through change and duration. So we can only understand perception without time in an abstract sense. 

I think the people arguing there continuity issues or time travel or telling the future are not understanding that the whole ""weapon"" or whatever the aliens gave was the understanding that time is not objective. Time is a feature of human understanding. And the language allows even humans to perceive without using time. ",5cc7fb

If someone negotiates sex in exchange for payment or services, but doesn't follow through on providing payment or services... That's unethical, and it's sex under false pretenses, and there might even be a legal case for theft.  But it's not rape.   

The expectation that Ian had, which Louise knowingly didn't provide him was a child with a certain lifespan.  And that's a really weird guaranty to expect from someone.  In fact it would be a completely ridiculous guaranty to expect under normal circumstances, and i'm not even sure it isn't a still a ridiculous guaranty.  Or at least I'm pretty sure no woman has ever provided her husband with a warranty on their child.   

You want to say Louise lied to Ian?  You want to say lying is unethical?  Yeah sure, I'm on board with that.  But lying isn't rape.  

Having an affair before the marriage?
Not rape. 

Being married already and covering it up?
Not rape.

Not rape.

[""It was BOTH of their futures.""](#quote)

Eh... not really what I was getting at.  
My memories are about my past, because they are about my subjective experience.  We may share a past, but my memories of the past are not a mind-independent objective experience of the past.  And that's kind of critical here... Louise isn't experiencing an objective account of the future.  She's seeing her future from her subjective experience as she will experience them when she reaches that point of her own life.  If Ian was faking his anger, or if he was already thinking of leaving her for all kinds of other reasons, she wouldn't necessarily know that.  

I only remember my past.  You remember your past.  Louise only remembers her past, and her future from her subjective perspective of them.  And while we all may take part in each others memories, the experiences of those memories are still our own.  

[""But some of them absolutely are his future-memories.""](#quote)

No, Ian doesn't have future memories.  Just like if you got black out drunk, you wouldn't have those past memories.  Other peoples memories about you are not your own.  And even if they are significantly life affecting memories... you don't have a right to them.  The only exception to that, that i can think of is if Louise took the stand in a trial, and was asked to give an account of her memories under oath.  But that's one of those exceptional circumstances like how a warrant is required before searching your place, or something.  Some kind of special legal circumstance is needed to bypass the right to your own thoughts and memories.

And I don't think very many people would support that.

Heck, we have a recent example of a rape case where the victim was passed out. She didn't know it happened. She had to be told. So was that not rape? 

Arrival is the same. Louise knows the future, she knows that she has information that if she told Ian he would not create their child. But she withholds that from him. Knowing that when he finds out it will ruin his life, their marriage, and his relationship with their kid.

As for the second question the movie ignores that question. We aren't given any information at all about what Hannah's choice would be. We're never even told if she was ever told by Louise that she would die, how, and when.

So no, I don't make any comment at all about Hannah's life or choices with any certainty.  It _could_ be that she would have chosen something different. But the film conveniently and to its fault doesn't even attempt to clarify that.

Instead, all we get is Louise playing god for her own selfish reasons. She doesn't ever indicate that she makes her choices based on what those choices mean for other people. We know she doesn't care that she ruins Ian.  We don't know at all how Hannah feels about any of it.",5cc7fb

But it makes no sense, and it hurts my brain! Suppose she takes your idea and opts to act all crazy trying to change her future, and so gets a face tattoo or something. But then that would become the future that she sees, and so in that case she would want to deviate from this new future, so she would choose NOT to get a tattoo, and that would become what she sees.

So she sees Hannah, she sees the future and experiences what it feels like to lose Ian, and says ""I forgot what this felt like"" because she then experiences the 'present' where they first get together. It's all non linear. She is going back and forth between the time periods, so when she loses him its the future, but when she says that she is remembering the future in the present moment. ",5cc7fb

So Louise is still living in time, can't control it, but can perceive it - as just another dimension.

So you're always moving through some combination of space and/or time, with absolute rest being completely through time and lightspeed completely through space. This is essentially the key point in Einstein's general theory of relativity as I understand it - space&time get distorted by the energy and matter that go through it.

If we want to treat the events of the movie with logic, then I think it's most logical to stick with the universal application of closed time-loops and wave away the ""poof""-iness of their departure with [Clarke's Third Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws). 

Definitely a debatable point, though. ",5cc7fb
d9z4fjj,"The way I took it was that the heptapods can look anywhere along their time line, but are not omniscient and also limited in how they travel through time. We can perceive three spacial dimensions, but our manner of movement is pretty limited by a lot of factors -  gravity, in particular. So with the bomb, the heptapods knew that there would be an explosion, but didn't know what caused it or how to stop it. Maybe they never even thought to look for it until shortly before it happened. ",5cc7fb
d9z1s1b,"I also enjoy this kind of thinking!

Even if the heptapods could travel any point in time, to arrive at Earth they would still have to travel in space as well. With the expansionist theory of the universe that is supported by observations that are consistent with Hubble's law*, one couldn't ""jump up"" in time and let space rotate ""underneeth you"" until landed in the right spot without moving through space. 

Have you ever read Flatland? If not you might enjoy it. The prose is kind of stilted by the concept of what it would be like to be vistied by a higher dimensional being is still very thought provoking.

I started thinking about it when considering the sine wave. As a function, it can be drawn out linearly but it is representing a cycle that is closed, like the position along a circle. Illustrated here http://i.imgur.com/c9P9FPl.gif 

So if Humans think about time a function (a vertical line stretching out to infinity at any point along the X axis will only intersect once with the line at some point Y), could Hetapods think time as a relation like a circle (a vertical line will intersect twice in Euclidean geometry). Similar to the way sine can be represented both as a function and a relation. 

If heptapods do think of time as a relation, not as a function then its possible to from any point along the circle and draw a straight line and connect with another point along the circle (chord). 

So radial time would be being able to connect *and pass information* between two points along the circle. 

You can't experience all time from a single point, only one other specific point (for some period of equal duration in the 'present' and 'future' / 'present' and 'past'). As an example; the conversation with the General in the 'future' took as long for her to experience in the 'present'. This gets around the knowing all things problem.

The disadvantage of radial time would be ""seeing"" things, as you said, a closed loop. If there was some catastrophe you may not be able to see or even conceive of there being a way out of it.

True, Contact is very good, and is probably the best ""First Contact"" Sci-Fi movie ever made.

Of course the heptapods can't read english, in the same way we can't read their circles. Starting with symbols for anything other than Human would have been confusing, since that would be the first noun you'd want to teach.

For me, the silliest part is that they didn't immediately start with a whiteboard and by drawing things before Louise showed up, but I guess Louise has to visibly advance the american interaction for the sake of the viewer and the plot.

I think a lot of the movie becomes much more clear if you can do the mental gymnastics of understanding how closed time loops work. It helps explain the General Shiang interaction, why the heptapods did what they did.

Ken Chiang (author of the original short story) doesn't believe in free will, which I think is a natural progression from deciding that the universe is deterministic and that closed time loops could exist if you could access future information. 

We have the illusion of free will because we can't see future events. If we could, it opens a question: Would it be better to know if you knew if you had free will or not?

To clear things up for you, an excerpt from the short story regarding this dilemma- 

I liked to imagine the objection as a Borgesian fabulation: consider a person standing before the Book of Ages, the chronicle that records every event, past and future. Even though the text has been photoreduced from the full-sized edition, the volume is enormous. With magnifier in hand, she flips through the tissue-thin leaves until she locates the story of her life. She finds the passage that describes her flipping through the Book of Ages, and she skips to the next column, where it details what she'll be doing later in the day: acting on information she's read in the Book, she'll bet one hundred dollars on the racehorse Devil May Care and win twenty times that much.
The thought of doing just that had crossed her mind, but being a contrary sort, she now resolves to refrain from betting on the ponies altogether.
There's the rub. The Book of Ages cannot be wrong; this scenario is based on the premise that a person is given knowledge of the actual future, not of some possible future. If this were Greek myth, circumstances would conspire to make her enact her fate despite her best efforts, but prophecies in myth are notoriously vague; the Book of Ages, is quite specific, and there's no way she can be forced to bet on a racehorse in the manner specified. The result is a contradiction: the Book of Ages must be right, by definition; yet no matter what the Book says she'll do, she can choose to do otherwise. How can these two facts be reconciled?
They can't be, was the common answer. A volume like the Book of Ages is a logical impossibility, for the precise reason that its existence would result in the above contradiction. Or, to be generous, some might say that the Book of Ages could exist, as long as it wasn't accessible to readers: that volume is housed in a special collection, and no one has viewing privileges.
The existence of free will meant that we couldn't know the future. And we knew free will existed because we had direct experience of it. Volition was an intrinsic part of consciousness.
Or was it? What if the experience of knowing the future changed a person? What if it evoked a sense of urgency, a sense of obligation to act precisely as she knew she would?",5cc7fb
d9wcptb,"> The movie makes it clear that Ian left when Louise told him about the future. Theres a lot that can be extrapolated there, the main ones being that she knew the whole time and that she kept it from him and just the sheer horror of learning that your kid is doomed.

Again, no one is arguing that. But you are arguing that that is the sole reason the relationship ended. That the relationship was perfect until that. That is stuff we don't know based on the single moment we saw.                


> Aids and the death of the child being the ""secret"". Both of them would affect ian, it was just meant as a hypothetical.          

Except you are comparing apples and oranges. What if Louise found out Ian had several affairs? What is she saw that Ian was going to die of cancer. What if she found out her daughter got aids?

dd3ih2z,"Time has everything to do with perception, and just because we as human's perceive it one way doesn't make it an objective truth.

Special Relativity, perhaps the most groundbreaking scientific achievement of all time, hinges on the fact that *time is a relative*. Your perception of time is based on the observations you make due to your reference point (i.e. speed, position, mass), but to someone else it can be drastically different, almost to the point of not making sense.

And this is an actual, documented, real life thing. [Due to relativistic effects from speed differences, astronauts in orbit around Earth age SLOWER than someone standing on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation#Overview). That effect gets stretched by order of a magnitude when you consider larger cosmological objects like neutron stars or black holes. According to relativity, someone falling into a black hole would witness the entire universe's death happen in the blink of an eye, while to them time passes normally.

I understand where you're coming from, but try not to be so ingrained in the ""time works like this because we only ever see it work like this and it's nonsensical to think outside of that"". That kind of rationale, especially in this case, is not only *provably* incorrect but spreads ignorance and is counter to critical thinking. ",5cc7fb

ddi65pz,"Thanks for the response. I follow your logic until i reach your last sentence about her not living an active life.

I think this is an assumption. You're saying she is merely a watcher, and not an active player in her whole life. But this isn't existence at all. This is more of a sham to an actual existence. So she's just choosing a scene from an already completed movie and then pressing Play at the scene she wants to watch and be conscious for? And not that it matters for the point of either of our arguments, but your version is not interesting and quite depressing, haha.

What makes the movie beautiful isn't that she accepts her fate as a watcher of her own life, but that she _**chooses**_ to continue with the future/past/present that is currently foreseeable to her, despite knowing the terrible heartache she knows to come. 

The main proof I posit for this theory is her comment at the end about if her husband would change things if he had his whole life laid out before him. She's deciding in that moment whether she should change things or not. 

And finally, just because she can only see this one particular future/past/present timeline is because it is the only one currently foreseeable based upon her actions and choices throughout each moment in her life, not because it's a pre-recorded tape. And again, it doesn't add weight to my theory, but i believe it to be much more interesting and beautiful if she does have access to free will. 

I'm not convinced they don't have free will. The aliens currently know of only one foreseeable future where humans can help them, but that doesn't mean it has always been the case. You assume they can't ""go back in time"" to change things, but we don't know that. Whose to say the aliens didn't add contact with humans to their story because they knew in their original foreseeable future the destruction of their race was inevitable? So they decide to take a chance on humans and get them involved, which would cause a new foreseeable future to emerge in their accessible future/past/present moments.

In fact, what kind of gift would they be giving humans if it was only to show them an unchanging life that they have no power over. That sounds more like torture than a gift. The illusion of free will is the same as actual free will from the perspective of the individual. This so called ""gift"" in your version becomes a tool to remove any illusion of, or actual, free will. Again, that's more of a curse than a gift. ",5cc7fb
ddipson,"I fail not my good sir. Your explanation of the movie is on point, right up until your final thoughts. You first stumble in keeping your argument consistent when you say she ""already chose"". So let me ask you, if everything has already happened and she is merely a watcher of her own movie, and not an active actor, then how could she have ever chosen to do anything? At what *moment* in time did she decide anything? That choice would have to have been made in a linear-time world(which I'm okay with) but you say isn't possible.

This idea that she has no free-will falls apart when you get to this point. Yes, she experiences all moments of her life at the same time. This is because it is a foreseeable future based on past actions and probable future ones, not because everything has already happened and is unchangeable.

At this point i know what your thinking. ""*But there isn't a past, present, or future!*"" Well, you'd be right in the sense of her perception of her own life and of how she can perceive time. **But here's the main point:** linear time still exists. In fact, i would argue you can't have non linear time with out linear time to prop it up, but that may be a big rabbit hole. 

Think about it, the aliens came to communicate with humans, which live in **and** perceive time as linear. So we have proof from the movie that linear beings and non linear beings can communicate. How is this possible in your version of events?? Well, I'm afraid to say it's not. They can communicate to each other because of two main reasons: 

1: linear time exists on its own in the world. 

2: non-linear beings have the ability to still perceive **and** live in a linear time world. 

If a non linear being can live in a linear world then they have the ability to act out linear events, (like choices), that have a linear effect on the world (like cause and effect that lead to future events). So we see that free-will is possible (and this logic is derived directly from what the movie gave us; no assuming necessary).

Your personal experience doesn't change anything. I have personal experience with loss, too. I buried a parent this year and my only sibling died of childhood cancer.  I know for a fact that I would NOT want to spend my life knowing what was coming and being unable to do anything about it.

Would YOU want all the hope you had for your first daughter erased by knowing from when she was born that she was not, in fact, going to live the life you wanted for her, that you were wasting time making her attend classes that she would never put to good use, that you wasted time not knowing how short it would be? 

Would you want every moment of your time together stained by knowing how it was going to end?

You think this film is talking about enjoying life even though there is tragedy? NONSENSE.  That's what we have by NOT knowing and by being able to forget. The magic gimmick in this film UNDOES those blessings. 

You don't have to blame yourself for your daughter's death because you didn't know exactly what was going to happen. But if this film is a reality, then either way it's worse. It's worse if you know and can not change anything. So instead of dealing with your daughter's death as you did, it would haunt you from the moment you knew about it long before you did in reality.

> If I knew for a fact, how she would die, why would I not want her to have ever existed?

That's a personal choice. Plenty of people make it every day. But this film doesn't show that there IS any choice. We don't have a single example of someone who knew what was going to happen and changed it to prevent the consequences. 

But we do use a limited form of pre-knowledge and people do make life and death decisions based on it.  We test fetuses for diseases and plenty of parents make the choice to abort. Heck, people abort for much shallower reasons.

There are people, commented with one on this film on reddit in fact, who couldn't see the major similarity between abortion and the film. But it's there. The film manipulates you by showing future memories of the daughter who does not exist, and so the gullible audience decides that she NEEDS to exist, she has a right to exist, it's only moral if she exists how she exists. 

But what advantage is knowing the future if you are doomed to repeat it? You seem to think that the argument is between dead-daughter vs. no-daughter.  That's not the case.  The case is that the film precludes the possibility of healthy alive daughter.

> All I am missing is the how and when. That changes literally nothing.

Knowing the how and when changes everything.  Would you go to work to save for a retirement you KNEW you'd never enjoy?  Would you get in the car knowing that you were going to be killed in 20 minutes in a traffic accident?  Would you buy life insurance for a 3 month period where you knew you would not die?  Would you marry a person you knew was going to cheat on you and abandon your children? Abuse them? Kill them? Kill you? 

Would you read a book you knew you wouldn't like?  Would you eat food you knew would get you sick? Would you do anything spontaneously any more? Would you have hope for anything knowing that such an emotion would be illogical?

I felt that if she had broken it all down to him, ahead of time. That would have been a more ideal way to do it .

All of that being said. i kinda get it. Yes, its selfish, no i dont think about it as rape. But yes she basically put him through the equivalent of torture.

Basically as she learned the language her visions showed her short memory like glimpses of her future. Memory, in the sense that she probably felt what she felt when the memories were being made. So.. strong emotions and bonds forming as she saw these visions.

She made a judgement call that i dont personally agree with but it does seem rational. She knew her kid was going to die and there wasnt anyways around it.

The reason they said: ""We help humanity"", followed by ""We need humanity's help in 3000 years"" was because they have already seen or already experienced whatever takes place in 3000 years and have seen that humanity will be the ones to assist them, in whatever form that is. 

That being said, the reason they said it like in my opinion is to make *Louise* understand their purpose and humanity's role in it, because she still thought of time in that past/present/future linear sense. It was for *her* understanding, not necessarily how they think of time and ""3000 years"". They don't need to have a perfect understanding of time like we do, but obviously they do because they have *seen* how humanity perceives it and adapt their communication with Louise to that fact. Time is not a single line going in a single direction for them, but they know that it is for humans (at least for now), so they say it like that.

I understand the whole time dynamic that you talk about, it still doesn't explain why Abbott dies. It seems like he is dying for no reason what so ever. You say its a sacrifice, a sacrifice how? I dont see how anything would have changed if he had stayed alive.

Like in my opinion the bomb didn't kill him, he's safe behind alien glass, and the bomb was pushed well away. Some people have said Abbott exhausted all his energy and that's why hes dying, but that bullshit because in the begging of the movie someone was saying how the aliens could push them out of the room with gravity, so its clearly something they do on the regular.

d9wliv3,"Well, for her it is not.. I do not see there a loop because, for her everything happens at the same time. Since now, for her is life deterministic (because she knows the future) but changeable (because she knows the future, she can change it - prevent the end of the world by the call to the chinese general) .. She ""remembers"" whats gonna happen - party with former chinese general - and therefore she knows, that the world was not destroyed (our point of view) and is not destroyed (Louise).

At the party she seems to be surprised when she hears those crucial informations how to save the world. WHY?? I am sure that is because it is for the first time, she hears how to save the world. At this point it looks like the loop, because we think that there is a time interval 18 months between getting these informations and using them. Thats for normal people, for Louise it is not, and maybe thats why she is surprised (for her there is no interval - at the same time she gets and uses this information).

We (normal people with linear time perception) observe a loop, the paradox.. because in the movie the information about phone number and last word of his wife comes from chinese general and not from Louise. That obviously does not make sense - causality is broken.

But Louise percieves time differently, since now she does not ""know"" what is the unknown future, for her the future is present (her timeline is not horizontal line but vertical - everything happens at once). At one single moment she calls to the chinese general and speaks to him 18 months in the future (from the point of view of normal people - but from her point of view its in the present).",5cc7fb

What we consider time is just us measuring. Seconds, hours or years aren't real. They are just something we use to measure an abstract non-linear concept.

dgsyjff,"So, gaining the gift of foresight *does* change the future.

But only once.  Basically, in your future you *might* get hit by a car in china (or whatever), when you gain foresight, everything bad that happens to you, that can be stopped, that results in the best outcome *that you choose to accept* becomes your immutable future.

So, lets imagine there are 1 event in your future, with 2 choices you could make, and depending on your choices there, you get a followup event.  (in reality it is infinite events and infinite choices but whatevs)


1 event, is take a job, or not.

If you take the job, you have to go to china where you can dodge a car in china, or not.

If you don't take the job you stay at home and you can choose to get married or not.

There are 4 final outcomes to all your choices.

- got a job, dead by car crash
- got a job, living in china
- No job, but happily married
- no job, not married

When you gain the gift of foresight, you would evaluate all of these choices and outcomes, and all the time between them simultaneously.  Your brain knows all of it at all times.  You would basically always pick the same choices, because at every choice you would know the outcome and have a preference.

Your preference **can't** change, because your preference is based off full knowledge of the future and past at all times.

so, You **could** choose the choice of Job in China (and alive).  Nothing is stopping you.  But your perfect-information-brain-choice might (for example) always pick to not take the job, and get married.  *Just because it is your in-aggregate favoured option.*

Basically, foresight would result in you always living your subjectively **favourite** version of your life.  (You always pick the choices you would always pick!)",5cc7fb

d9z1u2d,"Thanks for the great discussion!

So, to me, time is simply the space between cause and effect. Humans can only see the effects as they happen and can trace back the cause(s) through memory. 

The Heptapods (and Louise) appear to be able to also trace forward in their ""memory"" to all future effects (within their lifetimes) from past, present and future causes. Therefore, many of the ""causes"" of their present events are effects from future causes. Past events caused by future events are closed time loops, and the Heptapods do not appear to be able to affect these loops, nor their future despite knowing it. Humans don't get these loops along their timelines because they can't access future information, so there aren't any ""backwards"" cause-effect connections.  

My understanding of your theory is that if the Heptapod's lifetimes are a giant circle of time, then they can access the future within a set chord length away from their present location along that circle. Or can the chord length change? Then what would prevent them from scanning their entire future anyway? Not sure I understand your idea. 

I guess it'd be like living in a [zeotrope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoetrope) that only goes around once, but if you have perfect memory can see all future (since your offspring can pass it backwards) and you can know all past (since your ancestors could pass it forwards). So, from the second you understand the language, you know your role in history and play it your entire life, knowing how it starts and how it ends the entire time.

Another perspective is that life is a gift and suffering is an aspect of life. I think that's a really Christian perspective of God's love being present even in times of trouble.

What if the essence of the alien is not merely the physical heptapod you see, but some consciousness that can organize matter without humans ever knowing?

dah5bg3,"I might be going into too much detail, because I'm not sure how much you want me to explain. 

[The aliens' mission on Earth was to give humans a ""weapon"", and that eventually, they would come back in the future when they need our help. The ""weapon"" that the aliens wanted to give to humans is actually the result of an imprecise translation of the word ""tool"". Their written language doesn't have an element of time associated with it, and somehow learning it allows someone to see into the future. This ability is the tool that they want us to have.](#spoiler) 

The movie is structured in a way that makes it seem like [the main character Louise lost her daughter to cancer/some incurable disease some time before the aliens arrived on earth. The twist was that this happens in the future, long after the aliens had left. The twist is revealed when she enters the ship by herself and speaks to the alien Costello - she has a ""memory"" of her daughter, but it turns out it is actually a ""vision"" of the future - ""who is this girl I keep seeing?"" and Costello tells her that she now has the ability to see things that haven't happened yet.](#spoiler)

After Louise figures out [the true nature of this ability, she has a another vision of talking to her future daughter. It's clear from the conversation that Louise and the father had separated at that point. The daughter asks Louise about her dad, and why her parents aren't together anymore - Louise says ""I told him something, something he wasn't ready to hear"" = I know that our daughter will eventually get sick. The daughter understands that her parents won't get back together, but is more concerned about something else -  ""Daddy doesn't look at me the same way..."" = he was devastated with the knowledge that his daughter will eventually die from this sickness so he can't look at his little girl in the same way anymore. The daughter just wants to know why the dad started acting this way. Louise says she had told the dad about ""something that would happen in the future, something that was unstoppable,  just like you"" = the sickness is completely incurable.](#spoiler) 

When Louise exits the truck and [snaps back to the present with Jeremy Renner/Ian, she says ""Now I know why my husband left me"".](#spoiler) 

So to summarize, [the father was Ian, he and Louise married after the aliens left and had a baby together. At some point, Louise decided to tell Ian about her visions of their daughter. Louise has known all along that their daughter would get sick and die from a horrible disease, but knowing all that suffering they and their child would eventually go through, Louise went through with the relationship/having a baby with him anyways. After hearing all of this, he decided he can no longer be with Louise anymore. The very end of the movie when the reveal the identity of the dad = confirms Louise knew what happen and chose to go through with it anyways.](#spoiler)

But if he's acting like a turd to louise I'd say he is justified in doing so. 

All of those what if's are perfectly valid too. But Ian didn't have visions of himself having affairs with a bunch of women while married to louise. He didn't have any visions. He didn't have visions of his daughter. She was the only one. 

It's not his movie but he was the secondary character. The other half needed to fulfill her future, to conceive the daughter. I think arguing about theoretical space time manipulation is pointless because it's entirely science fiction and just too hard to wrap your head around, but the movie made it seem that while louise had the power to see the future, it was the future she would cause to happen. She saw a unified earth, caused by her calling the general. She then took that phone number and fulfilled that future. In the same way she saw her daughter, and did everything to realize that future. You're right in that it wasn't his decision to make. My whole thing was that it was hers, and it was a selfish one. I don't buy that she was powerless to the will of time.

Also making everyone think she was a mourning mother for the first 3/4 of the film was solid deception and setup for the twist, but now that I think about it if she had no idea who the girl in these visions was ""who is the little girl?"" then why does she act so bummed out and distant as though she is in mourning?

It is possible that it was meant to allow them to ascend and descend safely, and they simply used it to bring her in as an emergency after assesing that she would be able to survive in there (although she seemed to have a harder time breathing). It's also possible that they are able to control the ship's physics entirely since we saw it disappear and leave a trail of ink. Maybe the composition is a hardened form of whatever they expel from their ""hands."" If this is true then they could have simply made the pod at that instant and brought her back into the room without using the bottom entrance as that was no longer necessary.

This is kind of what you're doing when you remember the past. You're finding the moment in your mind and then playing through it. The movie tells us this is how heptapods view time. They remember past, present and future. So by definition they find the moment in their mind and watch it play out. They don't live in one moment, they live in *all* moments.

Another assumption, which again goes against what is explained in the movie. I personally think that scene has more to do with her testing reality and causation. By asking him if he would change anything she is assuring herself that nothing can be done.

I'm not saying you're wrong about this assumption by the way, just that it contradicts the premise of the film. If time isn't linear then ""now"" is not the present moment - it's all moments. And in that case there is nothing that can be changed, because everything has already happened.

You're not an active player in your past, yet you don't think this makes life less worth living.

You can try to imagine adding another dimension to time and yet you're forced back to the fact that it has nothing to do with perception and everything to do with conceptual naming.

Think about it like this. Things happen. They happen whether you are traveling fast or slow or whatever. They happen and then they are in the past. That's done. You cannot go back to that state because it's simply what already occurred. But even more preposterous is the idea of going to the future. The future is just what hasn't happened yet. Things need to happen for the future to exist. There's no way around it.

del5rbl,"Well. I don't know about other dimensions. You might be able to argue something like that but I don't think that was explicit. 

What I'm saying requires a little bit of context. 

Humans currently (and as far back as we know, probably always) perceive through the lens of time. We understand the universe through a series of changes. Cause and effect. Etc. philosophers like Kant suggested, as an example, that we perceive things spatially and temporally as a feature of our mind via evolution. This is why I can say ""imagine a planet a hundred light years away. Is that planet spatial and in time?"" And your answer will be definitively ""yes"" even though you literally know NOTHING about the planet I'm asking you to imagine. We perceive EVERYTHING spatially and temporally. 


Okay. So we have that idea on the table. I think the movie is proposing something like that is true. Given that, the aliens come along and they do NOT perceive things temporally. Meaning they go about life, however you wanna define life, without perceiving time. This is extremely abstract. I couldn't say they perceive everything instantaneously because ""instantaneously"" is talking in terms of time. We can't talk about telling the future or past because those exist only with time too. We can't really perceive what perception itself would be like without time. 

I think the movie is saying, based on linguistic relativity (that idea mentioned early on in the film that the language you speak dictates your 'world view') that the alien language allowed the main character to quite literally understand the universe in a different way. A non temporal way. It changed the way she could think and allowed her to perceive without any need for time.

Keep in mind that this only makes sense if you accept the idea that Time is NOT objective. And that there isn't some universal clock ticking away allowing change to occur in the universe. This idea only makes sense if you accept that item is a feature of the human mind, meaning it is capable of being disregarded. You wouldn't need time to understand. You could understand in a *different* way

I had to look it up...  
Coercion is the use of non-physical force to get someone to do something they don't want to do.  
Coercive rape is the use of non-physical force to get someone to have sex when they don't want to.
The definitions can get pretty broad and abstract, but all of the examples seem to be along the lines of psychological abuse, such as threats of violence or anger, guilt trips, or telling them it's their duty and obligation, etc.  
I just don't see how withholding personal and private information amounts to psychological abuse.   

>I pointed out the similarity between the two situations.

Yes, and that's been your pattern this entire conversation.  Pointing out similarities, and declaring them the same.  Believe me, i've noticed.  And you're wrong.  With your line of reasoning you could make the solipsistic argument that everything is the same as everything else because of similarities, and there is only actually one thing in the universe.   

You want to know how to profoundly lose an argument?  Misquoting the person you are argueing with.  I never said ""The kid deserved their potential life.""  I said something similar.  But not the same.  And the difference is critical.  

What I said was ""Hannah shouldn't be denied existence cause her Dad couldn't cope with her brief existence."" 
This is compatible with my view that the father has no say on whether the mother should get an abortion or not.  It's also besides the point, since we're not talking about abortion.  We're talking about what constitutes rape.   I only brought it up to show that Ian's regret over how the child turned out is kind of unreasonable, because he expected a guaranty on something that no woman would reasonably be able to guaranty under normal circumstances.  

The more i think about it, the argument we're having is over a contradiction that is made by the movie itself.  Your position seems to be that withholding information constitutes a removal of choice.  And that sounds reasonable, except that that for if that were true, than a completely informed decision requires perfect knowledge, I.E. Omniscience, which is impossible and denies free will, vis a vis Free Will Paradox of God.  

The only way to say that any choice and free will is possible is to relax our requirement of perfect information to reasonable information.  But Ian has that.  What Louise is withholding is perfect information.  So the movie is supplying us with a contradiction, in that Ian is expected to make a choice which is either satisfied by sufficiency with reasonable information, or dissatisfied by the necessity of perfect information which he would never have anyway, and therefore he would never have had any real choice to begin with.  You either have to accept that Ian knew everything he could reasonably be expected to know, and that Louise divulged everything she was expected to divulge.  Or you have to accept that a completely free choice requires perfect information which is an impossible standard outside of this one single circumstance which is only made possible through movie contrivances.  

the only way to resolve the paradox is to say that perfect knowledge is a reasonable expectation to make a choice.  And you can't.  It's a logical contradiction.   

That's why i said arguing over paradoxes is pedantic.  They always lead to contradictions.  It's pretty much a given.  Saying the movie is dumb because of a time paradox is like saying Star Wars is dumb because force powers are inadequately explained.  ",5cc7fb

We film doesn't show us the horror though. Louise seems pleased. So people take it that she was pleased. I just don't think that would be possible.

The whole DVD movie exists, always, at the same time, physically on the disc. The end credits are always there, at the same time as the opening title sequence; and at the same time as the action scene in the 3rd act.... etc. It's all there on the disc, simultaneously, always.

What changes is where on the disc you are reading it (where the laser head is), at any given 'time'.

In the case of Arrivals, Louise is experiencing time to begin with in the usual linear way, she sees the opening credits of the DVD movie; that then moves on through the first act of the DVD movie etc.

At the point in Arrivals where she begins to learn the universal language being taught to her, she starts perceiving time non-linearly, and it's like she's able to subconsciously navigate to other parts of the disc, like accessing the 'scene selection' functionality of the DVD player.

The only real difference being that it's more like an accidental skip along the disc, because she sort of returns to certain points on the disc and plays through from there... back and forth as needed.

Therefore, there was always a part on the disc where Gen. Shen tells her his phone number. When the audience sees this, it's like she's been able to momentarily skip ahead to that point on the DVD, perceive the phone number, and skip back. And so on and so forth.

So to answer your question of how could these things occur if they need things from the future in place to do so (which I think essentially is what you're asking), the answer is that they always had occurred already, and the only thing that changed was how she perceived time (in other words, how she navigated around on the disc).

It doesn't mean that the gravity isn't real, just that it can't be observed or measured from that frame. Also, note that the video never addressed the point about two objects seemingly accelerating towards each other in the box. That said, your earlier comment about common sense not being terribly helpful when dealing with this stuff is absolutely right. 

Reference frames aside, I don't understand where the movie showed that they have any ability to control their movement through time. They can observe, but not necessarily travel freely. Louise also learnt their language, but it never changed the way that she travelled through time, only her ability to observe it. Even then, it wasn't omniscience. Just like we can see three spacial dimensions, but not with unlimited resolution and not through obstructions.

Regarding the chord length, the theory hasn't developed that far. There does seem to be some relation to the current events (""current"" relative to the perspective of the audience) and the future events. For example, Louise isn't aware that Ian is will be her husband until the moment when they're standing in the field together. Another example is when she forward-recalls the conversation with The General at the UN (??) party right when she required the information.

For the chord length to be constant, the forward-recalls would need to appear 'in order' to each other. Forward order: boning Ian -> Hannah born -> Hannah dying / Reverse order Hannah dying -> hannah being born -> boning Ian. 

It definitely isn't forward order (Louise doesn't realize Ian is the dad until the end of the move), but I can't remember if reverse order holds. 

If it chord length is constant, one could infer where other events, such as the General call, come in the linear time line. It would also, as you said, keep an individual from being able to scan their entire future or past. One could look across time and see what you are doing 180 degrees from now. 

If the chord length *is not* constant I don't think it necessarily invalidates the radial time theory, but it does make it more Dr. Who timey-wimey (barf). If that's the case I'd be happy to drop it :)

With Interstellar the father-daughter thing was a fantastic conflict and argument to the cold-hearted decision of ""Fuck Earth, lets start a new one and let all of them die"".

Lets say your on a train and it takes you less than a second to get from 0-100m, now you go in a car and it takes you 5s to go from 0-100m. Now you have no concept of the idea of seconds, all you can tell is that from your perspective the time in the train was much shorter than in the car. Well now lets say your life mirrors these two perspectives, well you will now perceive time with two different ideas. But we only perceive time in one perspective because our perspectives don't move at a speed that is different from what we are used to. So what feels like a second can feel like years to another. Basically Interstellar. 

What this movie tries to introduce is the idea that ""time"" itself has no beginning or end and that was what the aliens were trying to explain. The time you are experiencing is just one of many other possible occurrences at many different possible timelines. They also tried to explain that what you know or will know has already happened, because time is nonlinear instead it is fluid. The aliens were trying to explain to amy adams that she already knew the answer because she herself had already answered it at some point in the universal timeline ",5cc7fb

Time is subjective, not objective, and temporal perception by humans was defined and passed on throughout the ages as a means for ease of its understanding and use. It's kind of like how Einstein claimed that the speed of light is the fastest, but only because that's the fastest speed humans have uncovered, and might not necessarily be true somewhere else out there in the universe.

But in *this* particular circumstance, the aliens showed Louise *their* perception of time, which is the ability to either view the future, or view different timelines of it. That's strictly within the confines of this movie, though.

It's kind of like when you misremember an event from the past, and with new information, you think ""ohhh that's what *actually* happened"", but the past is already done, you already experienced it. In this case, Louise gets information from the general and she realizes ""ohh so that's what happened"". So she calls him not because he ""causes"" it, but because that's what literally happened-you can't change the ""past"" (even though the movie makes it out to seem like the future, that's just for the viewer's sake, she's actually experiencing both at the same time.).   
In the book, it's explained that even though those who experience non linear time know what's going to happen, it isn't a threat on free will because everything fits in place.

Why not so something more unique and more meaningful with the time?), she does not even seem to prepare her daughter or her husband for what is coming.

I know we want to understand as much as we can of a movie's plot by examining it's logic, but this facet isn't meant to be understood scientifically.

It's not important how learning the language enabled Louise to see time differently and save the day; the point was that she was already so adept with languages that she was the first to fully comprehend it. Costello (or was it Abbott?) helped her along. Once she fully understood it, bam, that's it, might as well called it magic, it's science fiction, it doesn't matter how the language works any more than how a wizard works magic. It's inconsequential. 

Is ""time"" (once she perceives it differently) set in place, are events impossible to change?

I'll say this though: finding out the daughter died in the first few minutes of the film made her a throwaway character. We all knew she was gonna die so we never let ourselves hope for the happiness of our protagonist in that particular vein. It stole that rise and fall of hope, exhilaration, and then tragedy for Louise, and as such it ruined any and all deeper nuance & insight we could've had for her decision to have the child anyway: it was all overshadowed by the knowledge the child would die young. 

You could *maybe* say that the entire point was that throughout her daughter's life, *everything* about mothering her was overshadowed with the knowledge that she'd die young... and in that way, the audience felt Louise's melancholy that stretched from the day of her daughter's birth to the day of her daughter's death... 

But if that were the case, I'm a little indignant. The film's asking me to feel sorry for a mourning woman who *knew* exactly how and when her daughter would die before she was even conceived? Like... no. 

You know who I'll feel sorry for? A woman who slowly learns a language that lets her see/experience her beautiful future-daughter and then suddenly slams into discovering that beautiful future--daughter's gonna die *super* young.

I'll feel for her when she's in the middle of grappling with that slam of realization and decides to have her daughter anyway.

But because I knew all along she was going to die, I was so ambivalent about Louise's decision to still have her; it just hearkened back to the very traditional, not-at-all-groundbreaking phrase ""better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all"" and while I think that's cool, it really wasn't terribly emotional.

But, regarding Arrival, (1) I was moved by the depiction of her daughter. I didn't care if it ""hadn't happened yet."" She introduced the story as though it had, which for narrator-her, it *had*. You just didn't realize how much of the film was a flashback. I believe she said ""it began here"" or ""I understood here"" or something? I'm looking forward to rewatching.

And (2) of course Louise was confused about seeing a child she'd never known. As I said, this is as close as the film can get you to feeling her disorientation without unnecessary distraction. If the movie had played the hand that it was her daughter (perhaps by showing Renner in her visions, by having someone deliberately spell it out) that would have ruined the entire revelation of the alien's language. It would have been a totally different and probably awkward movie.

Fundamentally, this didn't work for you. That's fine. I'm wondering if you can at least see that it's valid, that it's sound. Perhaps you've already said that and I missed it. (And I'm not demanding this or anything... just curious.) 

It's really interesting to me, because this ""twist"" is such a small part of my impression of this movie. It barely factors into my enjoyment. The whole thing works as one. I never had an ""aha"" moment... I realized the ""twist"" gradually. When the army guy asked them, ""Have any of you experienced stress?"" and Louise didn't respond at all, I noticed that as off.

I suppose our lead in Arrival has to do the same.

But the problem is that science - in opposite to Interstellar - is focused on language related theories, and just briefly throwing the non-linear. There's just to much to speculate, it's based on short story/novel...

The obvious problem with casuality (braking it) is the 'dead wife words' - kind-of deux ex machina thing which I hate in the stories. 

Similar problem exists in Interstellar and can be only explained by non-linear use of time.

The entire movie can be viewed as an attempt by the director to tell you that the aliens are intimately connected to the conception and life of the baby.

That's a clear direction tell if I ever saw one.  Also, did you see the child's play-doh figures...they were shaped like heptapod alien forms and the child remarks about the parents talking with ""animals"".  I cannot imagine a bigger set of screenwriting hints that the baby could be an alien.  Even the baby's name, Hannah, is itself a representation of nonlinear time (it's the same forwards and backwards because nonlinear time can have no direction) and thus the baby represents the essence of the alien existence.  The mother even comments in the very beginning that memory is sometimes not what it seems.

I think the interpretation of this concept in this movie is really well done and I do believe that if we were provided the ability to preceive time in this manner, we would accept our fates and live our lives as we see them. This is because any emotions we experience when we see our futures, in that moment we have already felt everything that ends up happening anyway.  Some may be provided the opportunity to change their outcome maybe but that may be unlikely. If we were to try and change our future, having known the outcome, each event is predetermined and the end result would be the same. In the movie, she known that having a child would just cause pain, but choses to do it anyway.

der0f6x,"This quote from the short story might change your mind:

>Freedom isn't an illusion; it's perfectly real in the context of sequential consciousness.  Within the context of simultaneous consciousness, freedom is not meaningful, but neither is coercion; it's simply a different context, no more or less valid than the other.  It's like that famous optical illusion, the drawing of a young woman face turned away from the viewer, or a wart-nosed crone, chin tucked down on her chest.  There's no 'correct' interpretation; both are equally valid.  But you can't see both at the same time.

>Similarly, knowledge of the future was incompatible with free will.  What made it possible for me to exercise freedom of choice also made it impossible for me to know the future.  Conversely, now that I know the future, including telling others what I know: those who know the future don't talk about it.  Those who've read the Book of Ages never admit to it.

The book of ages is an impossible book that describes everything as it will happen.  The only possible outcome of reading the book of ages is a loss of free will, if you read it and were still able to exercise free will then you haven't read the book of ages.  Louise has read the book of ages and accepts she has no free will.  The reason she says those who've read the book of ages never admit it, is because someone who has not read the book of ages, still believe they have the free will to influence the future.  This is ultimately what causes Ian to leave her, because she reveals something she knows from the future and Ian believes she had the choice to change it.

At the time of the phone call with Shang, she hasn't read the whole book of ages.  She's reading a page from the future for the first time, and then goes back to reading a page from the time of the phone call for the first time.  The fact that she hasn't read the whole book is what allows her to be surprised, because she doesn't know what happens next.

There's another good explanation in the book using Fermat's principle.  It's the principle that the path taken by a ray of light is the shortest path.  If the ray of light meets water along it's path, it will change direction.  In sequential consciousness, reactions follow actions.  The ray of light leaves point A, meets the water, changes direction and continues until it meets it's destination, point B.  In simultaneous consciousness, point B is known.  This can either mean that, in order to take the shortest path between point A and B, the light *chooses* an indirect path knowing that because it will be refracted this must be the shortest path or it can mean that the path & future is predetermined, just unknowable to someone who experiences sequential consciousness and hasn't read the book of ages.",5cc7fb
deoh52p,"Good pickup. I think we're getting down to debating definitions at this point. But I'm still hesitant to use ""past"" and ""future"" when talking about time in a non-linear way. Past and future requires a linear timeline doesn't it? Time encompasses linearity in its definition? Maybe? Not sure about that one. But I'm gonna roll with it for now. 

So saying the aliens perceive time in a non-linear fashion would be a much more simple way of saying that what humans perceive as time (in that it's linear, quantifiable, a measured rate of change, etc) is just a function of human perception. And what we'd call ""non-linear"" time isn't actually 'time,' but for comprehension purposes it's easy to draw an analogy to time.

It sounds like your still wanting to tie time into it, but you should throw away the concept of time entirely. for the Aliens, there is no time, not that they have their own version of it. It's just that time, as a concept, is not in play. It's not the ability to view different timelines or the future, its the ability to perceive timelessly. The movie *portrays* this as past or future timelines, but it only does this because there just is no feasible way to visually represent timelessness. I mean, the fact that its a *motion picture* already implies time exists. Its just very very abstract.",5cc7fb
devalpp,"> It's kind of like how Einstein claimed that the speed of light is the fastest, but only because that's the fastest speed humans have uncovered

In real life though, light isn't simply the fastest thing we've found yet, it's literally the fastest something can go in regular spacetime. It's the speed of causality, not light; that's why it's called c. All massless particles (not just light) move at c because there's no mass that slows them down. The speed of c was calculated before Einstein came along, Einstein taught everyone that space and time are linked and that gravity has an effect on that spacetime. (I'm doing his work an injustice, but I also need to be succinct. His work described mathematically how gravity, spacetime, velocity, and reference frames interact.) C was calculated using a version of the Lorentz Transformation using observations of electromagnetic fields.


Time is a real dimension and property of the universe; the only thing about time that's human is our timekeeping system.

There's a really good explanation of c [here,](https://youtu.be/msVuCEs8Ydo) hopefully that will make more sense than my short explanation.

Disclaimer:
There are a few theoretical ways to travel faster than light, but they're still not really moving faster than c. Any method proposed so far involves bending spacetime artificially and bridging the gap, which would involve such huge amounts of energy that they're unlikely to be possible without finding some way to use higher dimensions that may not exist.

If the action pertains directly to a persons feelings then, sure, the resulting feelings might indicate the rightness of the action.  But in a lot of situations, the action pertains to some other goal.  I might be fully aware that refusing to loan you $20 will upset you greatly.  But if you're a gambling addict, and we're standing Las Vegas hotel lobby, I might make a moral decision to refuse you the loan.  So Louise making a decision to have a kid, knowing it would upset Ian isn't necessarily immoral, simply because Ian was upset by her decision.  

Now, a better question is... Did she use Ian as a means to an end, so that she could have the kid?  If she did, if Ian was nothing more than a donor, so that she could have the kid she wanted, that would be immoral in a Kantian deontological sense. But I really don't think that's the case.  There was nothing about Louise's character that she was that kind of person.  And she did seem to have genuine affection for Ian.  If she could have had a family with Ian as a part of it, I think she definitely would have wanted that.  Ian was not just a donor.  She loved him.

I did too, and I was gradually hoping that they wouldn't make the daughter a future vision because I'd based so much of my understanding of Louise's character on how she was already a mourning mother that was barely holding on before she'd even been approached by Forest Whitaker. 

*That's* why I thought the film was kinda invalid. I have no *idea* why she was such an asocial, depressed, kinda-alcoholic, lonely person in the beginning of the film.

I've actually been waiting for awhile for someone to come back at me and my comments in this thread with the argument that she was *always* *un*diagnosed severely depressed. And that studies have shown that depressed people are more objective than emotionally balanced people, thus she would be better able to register, survive, and accept a nonlinear perspective of life than any well-balanced person (aka prior linguists that were carried away on medevac units)...

There's a lot to explore in that theory/speculation. A lot of valid thoughts. It's too bad the film didn't actually explore them and instead made it like a cheap plot-deceiving gimmick.


Edit: but wait fwiw I really liked the aliens and the tech and the events that happened all over the world and the political intrigue and especially i liked the idea that the language was a gift of nonlinear thought. very cool concepts there, but the parts where it was supposed to hit my heart just didn't land ",5cc7fb
d9y75p4,"I call bullshit on that though. I knew it could go that way (where the flashbacks were flashforwards) earlier than when it was explicitly revealed. I was *hoping* it wouldn't go that way though because it would've been stupid... and then it turned out that way and I was like ""okay that's stupid.""",5cc7fb
de3rlr5,It's really not that complicated. They have no idea if there are any micro-parasites in the air that slowly dissolve flesh that couldn't be detected via human equipment. The bird is for safe keeping. ,5cc7fb
de6k05z,"Because things can change. These aliens are unknown. Humans dont trust them yet, even after countless interactions with them. As others have stated, the atmosphere can change at any given moment, so they keep the bird around. Coal miners do the same. Honestly, I feel like you are looking too hard into some things. :p",5cc7fb
d9wx0a2,"So youre saying that her abilties were paranormal and had nothing to do with the expressly stated ""non-linear time perception"" crap? You believe they existed independently from the language, and in an alternative reality were the aliens didnt exist at all, she would have still had glipses of the future?",5cc7fb
d9xlglw,"Yeah I think I know where you're coming from. You can understand and accept the shift of perspective through time, but the events still have to happen one after the other, so how did the phone number appear beforehand?

Maybe what you're not grasping is the non-linear aspect of time as it's represented here?

You're stuck in linearity where A cannot result in C unless B happens first. So you accept that A, B, and C exist on the DVD (to use my analogy), and you can scrub between them, but they can only ever appear on the DVD in that A, then B, then C sequence if you play through normally (linear time perspective)

But to continue using the analogy, it's like the makers of the DVD printed it with the sequence being A, C, B, and Louise experienced A, then B, then C by using her perspective on time.

I have to go somewhere now so I think I could have done a better job of this. But I think I see where you're coming from.",5cc7fb
d9wz9mv,"No idea. I haven't read the book, but that is what other people who have read the book were saying. It sounds like it focuses a lot more on the learning process of the aliens. Even with the emotional aspects of the movie's story, I found the instincts of each of the groups I mentioned to be interesting.

When you think about the possibility of something similar happening in real life, those reactions seem understandable. The military's decision to be highly defensive and ready to attack. The government's caution to trust other governments. The soldier's wife's concern/fear for her husband during the telephone call scene. The Alex Jones type commentator worrying about biological contamination and dangerous experiments. The looting/unrest in society with something so crazy going on.

All of that seemed to be a realistic reaction if something like this were to take place in real life. Not much of it seemed over the top like in other alien science fiction movies.",5cc7fb
ddbetql,"Because of plot-holes and trick narratives.  

",5cc7fb
ddco914,"You said ""before"", which interprets the movie itself in a linear way. Keeping with the rest of the movie, with everything happening at once, Dr. Banks knew Heptapod B even when the movie started. But for narrative purposes that wasn't what was presented to us as viewers, I believe. ",5cc7fb
dex4qr3,Are you blind? I said popular and insecure... Also I'm still alive so past tense is a bit redundant there no? Fuck this shit this is r/movies not r/politics. Go be an asshole somewhere else. ,5cc7fb
d9z3r6w,"Crap! Back to the drawing board. 

They're still going to get another ticket's worth of money from me. ",5cc7fb
db92zvu,"That is the movie though.  And the sentence does make sense, you are just confused.",5cc7fb
d9wzrvf,"Same, I just wrote it off as a cheap trick... showing a flashforward in an implied linear storyline...",5cc7fb
d9xaqkz,Or you were simply looking for a compliment on your mental masturbation. You don't need a graduate degree in either physics or chemistry to understand the movie.,5cc7fb
d9xdq9m,"All right, to be honest, the tenor of your replies does not suggest you were looking for ""intelligent criticism and creative thinking"" toward your idea - your replies instead suggest you were looking for people to say ""Brilliant! I hadn't thought of that! Your interpretation is so much better than the clear and obvious one!"" And unfortunately, when a movie is relatively clear about its message, you're not going to find people willing to sign on to a message that wasn't there and that you insist on finding tangential clues to.

When the main character tells you what the weapon is, and you insist that the main character is wrong and that the weapon is something else entirely, you have to offer proof of this beyond your own leaps in logic. Yes, Louise keeps having visions of her daughter - this is due to the important role she will play in Louise's life and the fact that her brain is slowly learning the language that will bring forth these visions. I think this must not have been clear to you, but she isn't having the visions when the aliens approach Earth - she's having them AFTER she's learned the language. I understand that that's not entirely clear, because of the way the movie plays with time (she's recounting her story, while also having visions of the future during the story - can certainly get confusing), but it's relatively clear that that's what happened.

And yes, I saw the child's play-doh figures - it's because she's been born after the aliens left and after her mother's book, which presumably includes pictures of said aliens, has been published. She's a child, so she calls the aliens ""animals"" because that's her closest understanding of what they are. And yes, the baby's name is Hannah, which is a palindrome as the mother said - this is because Louise presumably wanted her daughter to be a symbol of nonlinear thinking as this is what has become important to her in the wake of the alien's departure. Finally, Louise comments that memory is sometimes not what it seems because for Louise, memory is no longer just the past - it's the future as well.

Again, all that I've described above is actually in the movie. It doesn't depend upon looking past the actual dialogue and scenes in the movie to find it - the characters all talk about it and explain it without hitting the audience over the head with it. What you're describing, by contrast, is no where in the film. There is no talk of the aliens changing a person's biology. There is no talk of the aliens brainwashing people they interact with. Indeed, your interpretation robs the movie of its central message - Villeneuve postulates that even if you know how your life will turn out, even the sad parts, you would still choose to live it the way you know it will turn out. Ian's character is there as a counterpoint, but in any event Villanueve is talking about choice and agency. Under your interpretation, there is no choice or agency - there is only people being brainwashed by aliens to do their bidding, but having cancer get in the way of the alien's plan.

As I said, I don't object in the slightest to you coming up with a theory that runs completely counter to everything that was said in the movie. But I am starting to find it a little aggravating that you're insisting that a movie *only* can be interpreted in your way and that everyone else who takes the movie for what it says is not engaging in ""intelligent criticism and creative thinking."" It's simply condescending.",5cc7fb
d9vy0x1,"Off the top of my head the character in Legally Blonde that wants to change the word Semester to Ovester because she thinks semester has something to do with semen. Therefore being presented as misinformed and ridiculous.

Loving animals is bi-paritisan I guess, but I mean the 'vegan, meat is murder' style stuff I definitely associate with the left wing.",5cc7fb
