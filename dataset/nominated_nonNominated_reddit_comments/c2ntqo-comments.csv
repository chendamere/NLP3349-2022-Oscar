eronera,"I didn't think they'd go all the way with Woody leaving the gang but when he gave Jessie his badge I lost it. He knew that Bonnie valued Jessie the way Andy valued him and him passing it along to her was absolutely beautiful. I feel they definitely left it open for a sequel in another few years but at the same time this feels like an end to Woodys story, who was the heart and soul of the series as a whole.

\- Tinny from the antique store was from an original Pixar Short 'Tin Toy'

erowhjt,"Woody‚Äôs first conversation with Gabby about them both being from the  late 50s really made me wonder what was up with Woody for the 30 something years before Andy in the 90s. 

Was he non-sentient until Andy claimed him? This would be in line with Forky not becoming sentient until Bonnie wrote her name on his feet. But we‚Äôve also seen plenty of toys be able to talk and think without having a person claim them.

Gabby has clearly been longing for someone to play with her since she came out of the box in the 50s. So why doesn‚Äôt Woody have any history beyond Andy?

Woody giving Gabby his voice box felt really uncomfortable because it just felt really emotionally manipulative (using the information Forky gave her against Woody). Made it very hard for me to care about whether or not she got a kid at the end because she was still a villain in my eyes.

Forky was fun but I found it hard to care too much about finding him considering he was basically garbage and in my head I thought he'll break in 2 weeks anyway.

The under use of the original cast hurt me too, despite some of the fun new characters. Even Buzz felt kind of sidelined.

And a bit of an intangible, but it was missing a little bit of charm that I found in first 3 (particularly 1 and 2).

errnpr7,"I think that some are missing some points about Woody's growth. He's generally been very selfless, putting his kid first. But the life of a toy is a depressing one in this universe. You either break or are eventually forgotten. Woody is experiencing this throughout the movie. Yet in the end he is still willing to go back, and we realize he's not doing it for himself, but because he feels that it is his duty. His friends, who we know have seen this coming, have to tell him that it is ok.

ex1pa2k,"Me personally I loved the movie. I thought it was great, I was entertained from beginning to end.

The main complaints I see about the movie are usually Woody and Buzz being out of character. Woody being out of character in leaving Bonnie and his friends, and Buzz with his more unintelligent actions.

The Buzz one was admittedly a bit odd and hard to justify, it was extremely funny for what it was (in my opinion). I guess you could always try and say it's Buzz not fully turned back to normal from being reset to Demo Mode by Lotso in the 3rd movie. That or maybe living with Bonnie has dulled his leadership senses to a degree, since Doly is in charge and I'm assuming the second in commands are her other original toys. Out of everything in the movie though, this was probably the only thing that didn't sit 100% right with me. Not that I thought it was particularly bad, it was just sort of odd.

The Woody one honestly to me made perfect sense. You have to remember, when Woody belonged to Andy he was Andy's favorite toy. Andy and him would do everything together. Even in the first movie when Buzz was challenging Woody status as favorite toy for a bit, at the end of the day Woody always came out on top. Woody was THE toy for Andy, not just a toy, THE toy. This was especially apparent in the 3rd movie where Andy was going to take Woody to collage with him, and when Andy had the hardest time giving up Woody to Bonnie. Now, fast forward to Bonnie, she has basically reached a point where she lost interest in him and stopped playing with him. I think in the movie they said something like ""this is the 3rd time in a row she didn't pick to play with you"" or something along those lines. See with Andy, Woody was always the favorite toy, so for him to be all ""a toy's job is to be there for the child"" was something easy for him to say. Now that he isn't a favorite toy, and as a matter of fact is getting neglected in being played with, he is finally seeing what other toys have to go through. It's perfectly reasonable for his perception to change in that regards. He felt like he always had to be there for Andy because he was Andy's right hand man, but now he is realizing (as was mentioned multiple times in the movie) ""Bonnie is not Andy."" He lost his purpose, or at least the purpose he had when he was with Andy. He was no longer a favorite toy, he was no longer getting play time, he felt like he basically achieved everything he could. So when it came time for him to split up with his friends and Bonnie, to me it made perfect sense. He found a new purpose, to help other toys find owners and experience the love that many toys don't receive, the love he got from Andy. As far as him leaving his friends, well they basically said ""Woody it's okay to leave"" without actually saying it. They all knew he wasn't as happy as he was when they all belonged to Andy, that he wasn't being played with, that he was going through a funk. They were all still being played with but he wasn't, they wanted him to leave and find a new purpose and enjoy his life with Bo. And Woody, realizing he now has a new purpose/passion, went for it. It wasn't that Woody was ""out of character"" in this movie, he just grew as a character and went through some character development (in my opinion rather great character development). Honestly I'm kind of shocked at how many people couldn't see what was really happening with his character and said he was ""out of character.""",c2ntqo
erpq7lv,"Idk the themes in this movie felt like it was made more for me as a 25-year-old who is going through some shit, more so than the actual little kids this movie is supposed to be for. 

The way it handles loss, coping and moving on is honestly really, really well done. Plus, I mean, there is an overall theme of feeling useless, not knowing your purpose & being unhappy where you are ‚Äî all which get resolved in honestly inspiring ways. And they're not like small themes. This is the whole movie. So I really liked it as a 25 year old person, but maybe not so much as a 5 year old though.",c2ntqo

eshqc0c,"I want to start off by saying that I am a kidney transplant recipient. I was on dialysis for two years before I was put on the transplant list and found a matching donor to give me his extra kidney. This all happened from ages 20-23.

I loved the storyline of Gabby Gabby wanting Woody's voicebox from the first time they spoke. She asks what year he was made and is super excited when be says the 50's, like it's rare or something. It reminded me of how hard it is to find someone that's willing to donate, let alone compatible with your blood type, especially for O types like me.

It was definitely portrayed as creepy and violent the way she went after Woody to get the voicebox, I agree. But I connected with her so deeply at that point. After two years of dialysis, where you go to a cold, closed off clinic full of dying people 3x a week for 4 hours at a time to have two needles inserted into you to clean your blood while your kidneys can't? You get desperate. And if you know someone is compatible but hesitant, you feel yourself starting to gnaw away at them, trying to convince them to help you out.

That's why the next scene was so important to me, and was when the tears really started flowing. When she asks Woody about all of the years he has spent with his kids because he's a working toy, and how great they were. And how she just wants a chance to have o n e of those moments. That's exactly how I felt being a college kid strapped to a dialysis chair. Kidney donation is no small thing for the donor, but they recover and go back to their life with maybe a few dietary changes. But for the recipient, it's fucking everything. It's made out to be the final cure to solve all our problems. I wasn't a huge fan of how the scene played out where Woody finally agreed to give her the voicebox, because the music is ominous and scary, and the mood just feels ""bad"". But later the mood lightens up again as Woody is shown to be totally fine and Gabby Gabby celebrated the success.

But sometimes it takes a little while longer after the surgery is done. I really appreciated the scene where Harmony doesn't want to play with Gabby Gabby, even though now that she's had her ""transplant"", everything is  supposed to be exactly how she predicted. Once I got the kidney and left the hospital, it was a month before I could go back to my hometown and see my family and friends. My body had a hard time adjusting to the new medications and I was in and out of the ER with fevers and pain. It seemed like I had just swapped old problems for new ones, and nothing was actually fixed. What was the point of having a surgery if they were still drawing blood three times a week to check on me?

And then we see that after a little while, Gabby Gabby set her sights on someone new. It wasn't who she had predicted or wanted originally, but it was just as good. About 8 months after my transplant, my levels were finally stable, I had started gaining healthy weight, and I had physical stamina back that I never thought I would have again. My goals have changed, and the people that are in my life have changed, too. How the events played out seems so perfect that it makes me wonder if someone behind the scenes had been a donor or recipient.

These movies have always moved me, but this one hit me right in the kidney. I loved it.",c2ntqo

- The unicorn wanting to send the dad to jail.

- Forky‚Äôs love interest and him still having no idea how he exists.

Biggest Cries:

- Well okay, I only cried at one point in the movie but I usually find it hard to cry in any movie even if I feel like it. I was sad but not crying when I realized Woody was leaving, but when the rest of the cast that have been with the franchise since the beginning found out, I just completely lost it.

- Woody‚Äôs initial goodbye to Bo nine years ago was pretty sad. I know he mentioned it in Toy Story 3 but actually seeing it was pretty sad.

- When the girl just tossed Gabby Gabby away I got pretty sad due to the shock of it all. That seemed like when the story would‚Äôve naturally wrapped up, so seeing that she didn‚Äôt initially get her happy ending was upsetting.

- The montage at the beginning was a little emotional, ngl. Especially seeing Woody‚Äôs foot with ‚ÄúBonnie‚Äù written on it. It‚Äôs even more retroactively sad because of Woody‚Äôs realization that he‚Äôll still always be Andy‚Äôs toy, but now Andy‚Äôs name is gone.

Only real issue:

- I was really upset at how tossed in the background the rest of the gang was. I mean, I guess I‚Äôm used to Rex, the potato heads, etc being more supporting players, but it was a real shame that the potentially last Toy Story movie had so little of Jessie.

It was literally just a gag that he didn't understand the exact phrase 'inner voice,' tried something new (found it worked) and kept doing it, not that he had no concept of thinking for himself. It was like that episode of spongebob with the magic conch. He got wowed by a thing he didn't understand, it didn't mean it undid his character development or he stopped being conscious or anything. He didn't really leave Woody because his voice box said ""mission accomplished,"" he did it because deep down he realised Woody needed to go. That's why he said ""you're leaving this toy behind"" before he even pressed the button, the voice box just confirmed what he was already thinking. There really *was* no reason to follow Woody at that point. Forky would have been fine. Forky was happy in the trash, Forky was happy with Gabby, Forky was happy anywhere. Woody was going for himself. And Buzz realises this at the end when he tells Woody that Bonnie will be fine and to go with Bo.

Honestly I think there's pretty good evidence throughout all the movies that the voice module connected to each toy DOES reflect their inner thoughts. It nearly always says something ridiculously specific to the moment and Woody even speaks directly to Sid through his in the first movie. I think Buzz's voice box just pointed out things he had already subconsciously noticed and when Woody leaves, he presses it over and over again because he doesn't want to accept what his (real) inner voice is telling him.",c2ntqo

Bo was awesome. I liked Gabby Gabby very much, too.

The soundtrack was amazing and pretty fitting.

The new characters were fantastic and had some great lines. The yellow duck's line ""You are crazy."" when they left Woody was great.

The film was top notch on a technical level.

The scene where Woody says goodbye is my favorite part of the movie and one of the few times I got a bit of teary-eyed by a movie.

f28tnck,"I feel like this is a bit of a Frankenstein movie, but all the parts are so good individually that it's still getting a perfect score. Animation, lighting, textures, dialogue, characters, jokes, that's all on point. But then it feels like they had a team developing Forky and his hilarious character introduction where he keeps jumping into trash cans, and another team developing Bo Peep and her epic return as a hardened lost toy who rides around a pimped remote control car, and then they had another team working on Gabby Gabby/Harmony/Benson at the antique store, and then they were like ""okay how do we put all those things together?"". Of course Woody is the common denominator as he takes it upon himself to protect Forky, then meets Bo and learns that being a lost toy isn't so bad, then meets Gabby Gabby and finds a new purpose in helping toys find a kid, and then they link it all together by saying ""Woody was overcompensating by protecting Forky to try to stay relevant in Bonnie's life but now he realizes that he needs to find a purpose outside of having a kid because no one will be like Andy"", which I guess works, but it's a mouthful. Maybe you're thinking that it's not that disjointed, but there's really nothing that links Forky, Bo and Gabby Gabby outside of Woody's journey. The fact that Forky has an emerging consciousness is not important to the plot and the fact that Bo once lived with Gabby Gabby is not important either. Add to that the fact that Buzz has his own side adventure and that the rest of the toys drive a car and you've got a Frankenstein of a movie.

Bo is really cool, but is it just superficial coolness? What has she done in all those years? In seven years she never took down the evil tyrant that's presumably been terrorizing the inhabitants of the antique store (she recommends Woody ""cuts his losses"" so clearly she thinks Gabby Gabby is dangerous), or never found her a kid of her own. I get that Woody had the compatible voice box which accelerated things for him, but Bo had SEVEN YEARS.

Forky is very funny, but it's pretty jarring that the first twenty minutes are solely dedicated to his character arc, and that his character development is closed after that, and that his trash origins are never used again in the plot. It wouldn't have changed the story if instead of making Forky Bonnie had just taken her favorite toy to kindergarten orientation and then Woody had regarded that toy as her important toy that he needed to protect. In fact, imagine that: Bonnie's parents let her take one toy to school, Bonnie takes Dolly, Woody feels useless and therefore decides to appoint himself as Dolly's bodyguard, cue funny montage of Woody being overprotective of Dolly and of Dolly getting annoyed with Woody, leading up to a heated confrontation in the RV in which Woody accidentally knocks Dolly out the window ironically while trying to ""protect her"" of an imagined danger, then Woody has to go get Dolly because she's so important to Bonnie, then they have a heart-to-heart about Woody seeing Andy grow up, then Woody spots Bo's lamp in the antique store, then Dolly gets taken prisoner by Gabby Gabby. See? It changes nothing to the story. Of course it's *funnier* with Forky because Forky is a funnier character who makes gags possible that would be impossible with Dolly, but that's what I mean when I say that all the parts are good, just unrelated. The people who made Forky are really good at making characters, and they are really good at making jokes, but it still feel like they worked separately from the people who came up with Bo Peep's side of the story.",c2ntqo

I like that this was a realistic scenario when a young child starts going through phases of playtime and starts to forget toys and favor others. Yeah, it would have been wonderful if Bonnie kept playing with all her toys including Woody, but it's just not realistic. Loved the running gag of listening to your inside voice, and then actually Woody implementing that at the end.

Curious to see what happens next. Will there be a 5th movie and if so, do we get Woody/Bo or Buzz/Jessie/Forky? Or, no follow ups at all?

>China has one of the largest organ transplant programs in the world. Although China does not keep nationwide statistics on transplant volume, Chinese officials estimated that over 13,000 transplants were performed in 2004,[4] and as many as 20,000 in 2006.[5] Some sources say the actual number of transplants is significantly higher, based on detailed analysis of hospital records.[6] As a matter of culture and custom, however, China has extremely low rates of voluntary organ donation. Between 2003 and 2009, for instance, only 130 people volunteered to be organ donors.[7] In 2010 the Chinese Red Cross launched a nationwide initiative to attract voluntary organ donors, but only 37 people signed up.[8] Due to low levels of voluntary organ donation, most organs used in transplants are sourced from prisoners.

He finds Bo and she shows him how it's OK to be lost, and the two of them eventually help other toys find their kid.

erragl4,"I am disappointed in this film and I am clearly in the minority.

The movie had some funny scenes, some good moments, and Gabby Gabby was good, but the overall film had no purpose which is a huge problem for me.

Some of my issues:

* Buzz, and the original gang as a whole, get no scope in the film at all. They might as well not have been there. The only reason the old characters, especially Buzz, were there was to give us the parting scene between him and Woody which to be honest, isn't great. The idea of Buzz and Woody parting can make a person emotional, however it has nothing to do with the way it was handled in the film. I can get choked up telling you how Andy goes over all the qualities of his toys as he hands them over to Bonnie. I have no idea what Buzz and Woody said to each other, other than Bonnie will be fine without you. I mean him giving Jessie the badge is more moving than what they did between Buzz and Woody. 

* There is no appeal to the lost toy life, especially for Woody. He gives up his friends and the love of child for Bo; a love story angle that the original Pixar guys said they would avoid. Woody's problem was that he missed Andy, missed being played with and missed having purpose. The lost toy life doesn't resolve any of those problems, other than Woody gets to be with Bo. This is a clear sign of someone ignoring character arc and motivation.

* They undid the ending of Toy Story 3. Woody enjoyed being with Bonnie and liked being played with, hugged, etc. Bonnie also loved her toys. Andy gives up Woody because he can see how much Bonnie loves him. However, in this movie, Bonnie unnecessarily pushes Woody aside. Woody is still hung up on Andy, even though 3 showed us he accepted, learned and moved on. This movie then goes nope, he didn't. How can we then trust the ending of 4? How do we know Woody isn't going to get sick of the lost toy life? Three gave us closure, but four absolutely did not.

* They introduced new characters and focused on them while shunning the others. We never really get to know Bonnie's toys, we get less time with the originals, and don't really get to know the new characters (except Gabby Gabby). The two fluffy characters are only there for their repetitive jokes. They wanted a home but then just stay behind with no explanation. Whatever, the audience will just assume that they wanted the free life like Woody, even though they see the value in being with a child to the point that they help Woody and Bo.
 
* Woody's original problem was that in Bonnie's room, he wasn't in control. The typical lesson he would learn is that others have skills and expertise he might not have and possibly accept and respect Dolly. However, that never happens. Even with Bo, he doesn't learn that lesson. She even says that he is right. So what does Woody even learn this movie? How does he grow? It really seems like a movie about a toy running from his actual problems.

* Part of the appeal of the original movies is the appeal of every day things. Buzz flying off the car coaster and getting stuck in the fan. The carnival and antique shop setting don't add anything.

* Riding off the popularity of Keanu Reeves. Keanu's character saying ""woah,"" although not a big deal here is setting a bad precedent for Pixar that has avoided such self-serving and wink wink references for so long. Pixar has avoided fan servicing but I guess that won't last long. 

The problem, with this movie, and others is that they focus on pieces but not the whole. The character arcs, lessons, plot are not fully developed. I don't hate the movie but it does regress rather than move the franchise and characters forwards. It feels like more of a spinoff or a short than a continuation in the Toy Story movies.

Not really.  
Did I watch it and cry like a baby anyway?  
...Yeah.  

I‚Äôm late, but some thoughts: Overall I enjoyed it, the ending was really bittersweet. I understand what the creators were going for, but Woody leaving his friends still broke my heart. It doesn‚Äôt seem like too much time passed since the third movie so I couldn‚Äôt help but to wish Andy had just kept Woody and brought him to college...  

My other main gripe was how Woody lost his voicebox; Gabby pretty much manipulated him into it. When she offered to return it, I wish he accepted. Gabby‚Äôs a decent looking doll even without the voice; if the lost kid who picked her up accepted her the way she was, without being ‚Äúfixed‚Äù, it would‚Äôve been a wonderful message.",c2ntqo

The ‚Äúinner voice‚Äù would have been a hilarious side gag akin to Spanish Buzz in 3, yet instead this was the driving force for Buzz the entire movie??? Buzz was a doofus and that was such a slap in the face to a lifelong TS fan.

The Buzz I knew and grew up with would not have let Woody jump out of the RV alone. He would have stopped at nothing to be by Woody‚Äôs side and make sure he was safe. 

Buzz and Woody had almost 0 meaningful scenes in this movie which made their departure feel so much less potent than it could have been. Ah man. I really did love this movie, but there was a gaping, Buzz-sized hole in it.",c2ntqo
erq9d5e,"So what creates consciousness in the Toy Story universe? Woody, by his own admission, was made in the 50s but doesn‚Äôt seem to have any recollection of a life before Andy. He tells Forky that Forky is alive because Bonnie wrote her name on his ~~feet~~ sticks so you could almost conclude that a child‚Äôs love or ownership is what grants them life. 

Yet Toy Story 2 had the AntiGravity Belt Buzz Lightyear who was conscious despite never being owned. Same with Gabby Gabby in this movie. She was defective right out of the box and ended up in the antique store having never had a child of her own. So that debunks that idea. Maybe all toys achieve consciousness at their own rate and Woody is just a late bloomer having taken roughly forty years to do so 

Not that any of this *really* matters in a family film or even diminished my enjoyment in the slightest. Movie was fantastic, it just made me curious",c2ntqo

eumq2cz,"*Finally* got a chance to see this tonight and, ya know what? I'm so glad I did. 

I mean, I don't think it was a perfect Toy-Story movie like 3 was, something about the plot felt a bit...rushed, in places, especially towards the end. Like, for some reason I felt as if I was waiting for the stakes to build beyond *just* Gabby wanting Woody's voice box or getting back to Bonnie...and then it hit me; unlike in previous movies, I wasn't worried about them getting back to Bonnie. 

Like, with Andy, you saw the anguish he had at being parted from Woody for so long, even as a teen...but Bonnie ignoring him made me just side with his choice at the end. Like...*she didn't notice.*

But to be clear, I don't blame Bonnie as a character for this; I think, in fact, it was probably intentionally set up that way? The audience *needed* to feel that there was good cause for Woody to leave...even if it is kinda bittersweet considering all he's done for her behind the scenes. I think they should've maybe given her a few moments of acknowledging Woody directly, even if he wasn't her favourite; like catching a glimpse of him in her backpack and maybe just stroking his cheek, or a smile or something. 

Like, on the one hand, Woody doing it selflessly *is* just so heartwarming and a testament to just how far he's come from the first movie...but *still*  it's a little heart-breaking. 

All that being said though, I loved way more about this than I didn't; there was still that love and soul it's always had just shining on through!",c2ntqo
eud44fm,"Just came out of seeing it and absolutely loved it. I've seen a heap of people here say they disliked the ending, and that is fair enough, I can understand why. It did feel a little rushed, and I definitely think that Buzz and the old gang were sidelined for too much of the game.   


What I think the message that the ending was trying to convey was to show that sometimes we have to take risks in life and do what is best for us, even at the expense of others... that sometimes letting go of a good thing is necessary for us to grow as a person. Woody has always been devoted to his kids and his friends, he's completely selfless. But after discovering his individual self-worth and having tasted the freedom of independence, he's decided to make this decision based on what is best for himself. Bonnie was starting to move on from Woody and when she created Forky that essentially sealed the deal. Instead of being confined to a closet and forgotten about, he wants to live his life for himself, and there is nothing wrong with that.",c2ntqo

es28xzn,"Some thoughts on the meaning behind the toys in the movie. Every toy is like a parent or adult in real life. Whether they ‚Äúhave a kid‚Äù or not literally means if they‚Äôre a parent.

Woody- basically how you‚Äôd like to imagine the best parts of you being a dad. Always has a plan, willing to jump out a window for something your kid loves. Sacrifices everything for his kid and he‚Äôs willing to do it again

Buzz- introduced as ‚Äúthe greatest toy ever‚Äù. He‚Äôs how you view other dads. Confident, kinda dumb, and he‚Äôs gotta finish the mission. His ‚Äúinner voice‚Äù that he keeps on listening to and miraculously succeeding with, is like r/dadreflexes. He doesn‚Äôt know what the hell he‚Äôs doing, but still manages to get the job done. 

Bo Peep - is somebody raised old school, but it got cut short for one reason or another. She‚Äôs considered lost, but she‚Äôs the happiest toy in the movie.

Gabby gabby- is the opposite. She wants everything woody had, but felt like she wasn‚Äôt equipped to be loved. She‚Äôs basically a successful single person, has drones working for her, and she desires the picture perfect family. She ends up adopting a girl in need once she feels she‚Äôs ready, even though she‚Äôs been rejected repeatedly from the conventional parenthood she was raised to try and achieve.

All the other old school toys are parents you can probably imagine if you tried. Mr. and Mrs. Potato head - seinfelds parents. T-rex, looks scary but he‚Äôs actually scared and a big softy. Army men -duh. The pig - basically the opposite of the t-rex. Bonnies patch doll- the mom in charge and the one that knows what she‚Äôs doing.

But my absolute favorite is Forky. Forky isn‚Äôt comic relief like key and peele are, he‚Äôs supposed to represent a huge portion of the audience. He‚Äôs every young adult. If you follow the rule thag once you‚Äôre a toy, you‚Äôre an adult. That means forky is basically everyone from 18‚Äì30. You like trash. You look like trash, and you have no idea what you‚Äôre doing.",c2ntqo
esdonq3,"When the gabby doll was practicing tea from afar is when I started to empathize with her and I didn't really see her as much of a villan after that.

The story was an amazing way to end it, woody was with andy for basically 18 years, he was made in the 50s and was getting old... he has done so much for everyone, the toys, andy and even bonnie. It was his time to move on, to be with his love and live for himself. The scene at the start proved that, when he wanted to go with bo, but heard andy crying out for him, he gave up bo to be there for andy. He had the privilege of being loved by a kid for a long time, now hes with bo and giving toys homes, its defiantly what I would see woody doing in his future.

eufl2bq,"It's incredible how much life is left in this franchise.  This is just a great movie, I laughed a lot. (I really found the Ducky and Bunny plans hilarious, especially the last one).  I couldn't believe how good the story was, and I wanted to see where it ended. 4 films and honestly, it's still a great film touching on great moments. 

A lot of people aren't getting the ending and... I think it's parts of passing on the torch and parts realizing there's more than Bonnie.  Bonnie isn't a fan of Woody, they could have pushed a little more ""she doesn't play with woody"" any more, and they do but she didn't play with him 3 times out of a week?  I don't know. 

In a lot of ways though, the ending kind of was about Woody leaving what he's already known.  He's no longer the boss, no longer the favorite toy, and while he's loyal, it's Buzz who tells him ""you don't have to do this"" with ""She'll be ok"".   The fact is Buzz and the rest of the toys could do everything Woody does, instead woody needs to feel needed so he over indulges with Forky and is the only one involved in that. 

Yes he's leaving his friends, but Woody no longer had a place with Bonnie, and while he is loyal... it's time for him as a cowboy to hang up his hat and move on to something else, which is what we see him choosing.  You know it all makes sense to me but that might be advance age setting in, or just the fact I've recently made a major career change where I gave up something I always wanted and had been doing for 12 years (video game programming) and it wasn't something that was good for me.  Instead I found something else that is far better and healthier.  It wasn't for a woman, but it was hard to make, but the right move.   Just something about it felt right, even if it wasn't perfect.

Pixar might have ups and downs but there's something about the Toy Story franchise that makes me enjoy each one.  I really don't want a Toy Story 5, but if they make one, I'll be back in the theater, because this franchise proved itself. 

BTW. compare the animation from the first Toy Story with this one, it's incredible how much better both the toys and the people look now.

PS.  Sorry I Thought the Buzz thing was clever.  He's not a bumbling idiot, he misunderstands one line and makes that the joke, and it works.

erx6e1j,"I liked it, but... 

First it felt smaller in scope than the others and im surprised that hasnt affected how well it was received. Slow and a little boring were words used by the others in my group, I disagreed at first but after thinking about it compared to the others i see where they‚Äôre coming from. The settings/scenarios were not flashy like 3 nor initimate like 1&2 (which were also flashy at times - pizza planet, zurg, crossing the road with cones, flying/chasing the car, airport, etc). The antique shop in particular really didn't offer much as a setting here and felt pretty uninspired. That said I personally was still mostly entertained throughout and you gotta love Ducky, Bunny, Forky, and Duke Kaboom (i liked Gabby too even tho some may have problems with her arc) - the new characters werent an issue and were definitely stronger than in 3 imo. Maybe stronger than 2 as well.

More importantly - the ending didn‚Äôt feel entirely earned to me. So Woody was leaving to find his new purpose as that wasnt with Bonnie who doesnt care about him. So is the reason this was a more fulfilling choice: his love for bo beep? That is a little depressing considering Bo was basically fleshed out in this movie, the rest of the squad had 4 movies with Woody and 3 in particular was about all of them being family. If Bo is really his ""true love"" I get that, but I guess I didn't feel completely sold on that point. Was it about helping more toys out there find a kid? This is more fulfilling, but I dont think they sold this hard enough as the reason. It was hinted at but not enough where it seemed like THATS what Woody wanted to do.

Im left with thinking it was a little of both, but also that Woody didnt know exactly what his new purpose would be or if he even needs one but that it wasnt with Bonnie. I guess thats OK but just not as satisfying as moving on to a clear new purpose. It‚Äôs a little depressing to say - move away from all your friends and family with no clear reason other than finding a new purpose for yourself, ya know? So I do think it‚Äôs important for Woody‚Äôs newer purpose here to be well defined. I dont *hate* that we didnt fully get that. It‚Äôs obviously got me thinking. But i cant help but feel not fully satisfied and that something is off about it.",c2ntqo
es3rtzc,"So shocked as I am to say this, it might have been my favorite in the series. It had maybe a touch less heart than 3, but I felt it did a better job dealing with Woody's arc as a character. I also *really* liked that they brought the focus more back onto ""why do children need toys?"" in equal measure to the ""why do the toys need children?"" that was always the focus of the previous movies. And it was *definitely* the funniest movie in the series, several of the Key and Peele bits had me legit crying with laughter.

But the *best* part of of the movie for me was during the final bit where Forky meets Knifey or whatever you want to call it. Right as Forky is walking up, totally awe-struck that there's someone like him now, a little girl in the row right behind me goes ""I don't like this..."" in the most concerned tone I've ever heard.

ervqtqf,"LOVED it. I was blown away by the visuals. The flashback scene where RC is stuck in the gutter while it's raining was beautiful...holy shit. The carnival was gorgeous, Gabby's ventriloquist dummies were truly creepy, and I loved the callbacks like seeing Lasseter's  original Tin Toy character open up the door to the disco, and Bo dismissing the grape soda bottle cap. 

Though I love seeing the OG crew together, I liked how Woody's motivation was shifted from staying together to making sure that Bonnie had the support she needed from her favorite toys. He saw everybody else getting played with more regularly than he was, and he realized that instead of just getting phased out, he needed to be there for her in a different capacity. Both Forky and Woody were both going through an existential crisis or sorts, but one realized he had to stay and one realized he was ready to go.

I also LOVED Forky. I work at a children's museum where we have a thing-a-ma-jig corner in our art studio where kids can craft their own contraptions, and I have literally seen kids create 'dolls' that they then place in their backpacks. I don't know if they become attached to them like Bonnie did, but it hit home so hard regardless. I mean, I spoke to my pet rock's smiling face and googly eyes on a nightly basis when I was 5-6, so I get it, Bonnie. 

All in all, this one didn't move me into a blubbering mess like I was anticipating, but I did get choked up at a few parts. What I didn't expect was to laugh as much as I did. I loved the humor (aside from Ducky and Bunny...I think they were truly an unneccesary cash grab for merchandise, and though I lol'd at the attacks they imagined in the antique shop, I could've done without 'em). 

Oh, and though I might be in the minority, I liked Gabby Gabby's slight redemption arc. The one thing I didn't like about TS3 was the bear villain. Gabby made Woody shine even more as a selfless, loyal, and empathetic lil cowboy. I wouldn't be mad if they started making Woody dolls with broken voice boxes. The audience in my theater reacted so strongly when she got tossed in that box after she tried so hard to get Harmony to want her.

erugxdz,"I really enjoyed the character of Gabby Gabby and how she and Bo helped Woody move on to his next steps in life. Gabby seemed like an out-and-out villain at first, but in the end turned out to be very similar to Woody. Both the leaders of their tribe. Both made in the 1950s (possibly, Gabby muses, at the same factory). Both have pull-cord voice boxes. Both want nothing more than to love and be loved. Both are fixated on one child in particular, Andy and Harmony. Both are collecting dust.

et02xox,"An important shift in the narrative - there are no evil toys there, every toy equally wants to be loved and have a meaning in their life. Even spork is clinging to its original purpose as trash. Everyone is just equally misguided right up until the end.

The most conflict spurs from how imperfect humans are and how warped their perspective can become. Harmony being a sweet kid who does not actually care for toys, ... De La Crux hating Keanu Reeves because he could not live up to  a commercial. Truth is, the commercials were rigged from the start. Humans making mistakes with Gabi Gabi's model and not fixing them afterwards. There is a whole new narrative which is, probably, well hidden to those who do not have the full series plot evolution in mind. And I commend them for taking a step into this direction, though calling it a social critique would be a stretch. Yet. And it also soothes my animist beliefs. Great (finale?) entry to the series.",c2ntqo
ers9i60,"I feel like lots of people complaining about the other toys not getting much screen time missed a key theme of the movie; they've moved on while Woody hasn't let himself.

This was Woody's movie. Yeah Buzz has a role in it, yeah all the other toys are there. But the other toys have moved on and embraced their role as Bonnie's toys while Woody is still stuck being unable to move on from Andy. We see this throughout the movie.

Woody's obsession with saving Forky is tied to nothing other than his desire to be cherished by Bonnie in the same way he was by Andy. He was always the ""lead toy"" in Andy's room and he has seen his role be replaced. Not only does he not control Bonnie's room, Bonnie doesn't even play with Woody anymore.

Even early in the movie, he slips up while talking to Forky about the importance of being Andy's favorite toy. He is so obsessed with saving Forky because he remembers being Andy's favorite toy and he craves that same level of affection and cherishing from Bonnie.

Eventually Woody realizes that he needs to let go but more importantly he realizes he will never feel that same level of attachment and love from a kid again. So he goes off with Bo leaving the other toys like Buzz and Jessie, who have accepted their role and are all played with frequently by Bonnie. 

Even by the end of the movie Woody has shifted his goal. It's no longer about him making his child happy. It's about making other toys happy when they find a kid that cherishes them in the same way he feels Andy loved him.

This was always Woody's movie. This was always his journey to accepting that Bonnie can never be another Andy. No matter how much he tries to make her happy.",c2ntqo

But then it makes me sad to realize Woody would've STILL been with Andy if Bonnie didn't fall in love with Woody, but in 4 she just cuts him out entirely.

I also felt like the movie was so static, I mean, lots of Toy Story 3 takes place at Sunnyside, but that worked, maybe since it was a more active plaxe, but the way the antique shop was done in this was kind of bland/boring?

Oh something something else similar I noticed between Woody's character arc and Endgame's >!Captain America, they found happiness by leaving their group and being selfish for once!<.

Maybe I'm thinking too much, but I felt like the toys being bounded to a kid was a metaphor for marriage, while Bo Peep being kidless was like embracing singledom?

I thought the gag with the ""inner voice"" was amusing with Buzz or Woody had that talk with him.

Gabby was a fine villain; I thought she was going to be like that purple bear from TS3, but she's at least different and you can't help, but feel sorry for her after she was rejected.

I thought Keanu's voice acting could be slightly more animated and over-the-top, but it works I guess. I was picturing more Johnny Bravo-style eccentric voice acting when he was going through the poses.

Bo Peep apparently became ""Punished Bo Peep"" in the years she disappeared. She refined her CQC skills, infiltration skills, runs a group of ""toys without an owner"" and tried to protect Woody from the vocal parasite that is Gabby.

f3o7b7a,"I love Toy Story. I've been watching all the films as I grew up and it held a special place in my heart. And I loved seeing the toys back on new adventures again... But..This movie is the WORST. Pixar makes amazing animations and I love the details in the areas and the amazing animation, voice acting, However, to me it feels like the movie was written by people who never watched/worked the previous films. Because the story just felt boring and so linear.

\-One thing that disturbed me a lot was when the toys disappeared and was found in odd places, like the 9 years ago scene where Andy found Woody lying on the ground outside when he was put on Andy's bed just 10 minutes ago. Andy didn't even ask himself how Woody happened to magically fly from the bedroom to the ground outside.This happened several times with Woody and Forky with Bonnie throughout the movie, it seemed like she just didn't care about how the toys magically disappears and ended up far away from where they were last seen. I know Bonnie is a small kid and all, but how did she not question how Woody and Forky appeared in her backback at the Antique store. How did she react when Forky was the only toy being left in the backpack.

\-Why did we see so little of Slinky, Rex, Mr and Ms Potatohead, Jessie and Hamm? They always did something together, all of them. I feel like the only thing they did was bringing the car back to the Carnival at the end.I also wanna rant about Buzz. Why did it seem like he partially lost his intelligence? he didn't get what Woody meant with ''inner voice'' and ''Conscience'' so he presses his own buttons and follows his automated voice instead of using his own head. He was a great leader type and orientated, remember how determined he was in Toy Story 2 when he was successfully leading the toys to the city to rescue Woody? What the heck happened with that Buzz?

\-How come there's a story book about Gabby Gabby and a Harriet's likeness being perfectly illustrated?

\-Another thing was how Woody just accepted having his unique, one and only voicebox surgically removed(stolen) from him by the antagonist's associates. From what I interpreted it, Woody was somehow knocked out, waking up to having it gone, just in exchange for getting Forky back. It's insane how he's so calm about it.I know Woody tries to be good for everyone, even the villains, but this was waaayy too far stretched to even allow this to happen.Gabby Gabby is the only antagonist that got a happy ending and found themselves a human who could love her, that's nice, but she still got away stealing Woody's voice box...

\-Literally 40% of the movie took place at the carnival, 40% at the antique store which was right next to it and the remaining 20% at various locations which lasted like a couple minutes. The plot was boring, it was only about 'Saving Private Forky' while the previous films had different problems to solve which happened at several places. Seeing the movie going back and forth from the Carnival to the Antique store was incredibly boring.

\-And the ending... the damn ending, I still have the sour taste in my mouth even after walking out of the theater 7 hours ago.WOODY LEAVES HIS LIFELONG FRIENDS FOR BO?? I know they had a special relationship. But I don't get how Woody risks everything to save a suicidal fork for Bonnie when he in the end leaves Bonnie and his friends. I get that Woody wasn't being played often anymore by Bonnie, but leaving them all for good?  Woody doesn't agree that Bonnie will be ''okay'' with losing Forky, but certainly think it's okay if Bonnie loses Woody. Bonnie promised Andy that she would take good care of Woody before Andy hesitatingly hands over Woody in her care. Woody is allowed to have his own dreams and free will, but excuse me Pixar, what kind of a horrible ending is this??

\-I have a hard time understanding why Pixar went this direction for such a wonderful movie series loved by millions across the globe. ''Let's make this movie bad so a sequel won't be requested?'' I feel like there's something with this that Pixar will never tell publicly.

If they ever decide to make Toy Story 5 in 8-12 years or so, I wonder how they are going to reunite Woody and Bo with their friends who's thousands of miles from who knows where... This time I hope they will end it just as good as it ended with the first two movies, not bittersweet as the third movie, and not horrible as the fourth movie.  
I'm just... really really sad how this movie turned out....

f32jomm,"A mixed bag to be honest.

Buzz shouldn't have been such a side character in this film, I understand in 3 it was hard to fit everyone in but he didn't have enough to do in this one, basically being left to one joke.

There were some funny moments throughout but I agree the action in some parts felt like way too busy and got a bit hard to follow. The focus on new characters also made the majority of the original toys seem pointless and like they'd just been brought along for fan service, they might as well have stayed in Bonnie's room.

The ending felt a bit forced, like they needed to wedge in an emotional ending to be on par with Toy Story 3 but it missed the mark for me. Woody's problem was invented in this movie and a role with Bonnie as a ""mentor"" to her favourite toys which he comes to accept rather then just running away on an adventure makes no sense to me and goes against the character completely. They already touched on this in Toy Story 2 when he was going to stay with the round up gang but realised he was making a mistake (memory a little hazy but I do remember that).  


I think it was a solid film, I just wish they didn't tamper with the end of Toy Story 3 by splitting up Woody from the toys, the rushed ending scene didn't help either.",c2ntqo
f3ppt0c,"I liked it a lot, probably enjoyed it more than toy story 1 & 2. I do have some issues though. 

Firstly, the old characters (buzz especially) were glossed over and mistreated. Toy story 3 managed to perfectly balance a large cast, toy story 4 was sloppy in comparison. However, the new characters were charming with many laughs to be had.

Next, I didn't like how the last half of the movie was just pure stress about getting back to the car on time, and convoluted solutions to drag the story further. This is a reoccuring moment in toy story films and I've had enough of it. 

Finally, I like the idea for the ending, but it could have been executed better. My previous point about the constant sense of urgency ties into this. It would be more satisfying if it was given more time for closure.

&#x200B;

First, it seems a little fast to suddenly have Woody be doubting himself and his loyalty to his kid since he's only been with Bonnie for a few shorts.  


Then there's the fact that the movie only ever focussed on Woody, Bo and the new toys, with a little light on Buzz and barely ANY attention on the old cast. Remember when 2 and 3 had the old toys actually be involved in the big rescue/escape operations? Not here. Even Bonnie's original toys didn't do much beside try to get her dad arrested.

&#x200B;

And then there's Buzz. The concious gag was funny, but it felt SO WEIRD to see Buzz be so... dumb. Like, he's in awe at the concept of a conscinece, and is unable to decide ANYTHING without pressing his button to make himself speak. Where the hell was the Buzz that took charge in 2 and 3? Why is he suddenly such an airhead?

For that matter, why did he and everyone else need to see Bonnie crying before they decided to help out with Forky? They just felt like complete assholes to the new guy for no real reason whatsoever.

ervev84,"For context, I've always enjoyed the Toy Story movies, but I've never felt ownership of them the way a lot of people in my age group do.  I really liked the original trilogy, but I haven't seen them in probably 7 or 8 years and I've definitely forgotten plenty about them (for example, I didn't remember before seeing this that Bo is only in the first one). With that said I loved this. I really don't know what the last movie to make me feel this much was.

What I liked: A move about toys shouldn't be able to make me feel this much.  All the emotional beats hit for me, and I really liked the ending for Woody. The movie is also hilarious, the Key and Peele bits were the highlight for me. The movie's satisfying all the way through, from the ending for the characters to last post-credits scene with Combat Carl finally getting his high five. Basically from Woody's ""You're Bonnie's trash"" speech to the end I think this was an absolute masterpiece. The voice performances are great, the music is great, the animation is great.

What I didn't like: None of these really hurt my enjoyment of the film very much, but I thought the first 20 minutes or so weren't as strong as the rest of the movie.  Also I wish there had been more of the original toys, especially the Buzz/Woody dynamic. 

Two small things: Was that Boo from Monsters Inc at the carnival?  And also, did Pixar stop putting short films in front of their movies? I miss a lot of Pixar movies at the theater, so I'm not sure how many haven't had them.

I absolutely loved this, and I think it's my favorite movie of the year. It's a 5/5 for me.  I don't think it's perfect by any means, but none of the flaws hurt the film much in my esteem.

Toy Story 3 had the perfect ending where all the original toys banded together to escape the daycare and moved on together to a new kid as a family. 4 feels more like an extended short about Woody, the original cast felt like background characters. It's weird how in 3, Lotso became a villain because he was upset about being lost and replaced by his kid, but Woody explains that his owner loved him so much that she had to get a replacement. While in 4, Woody is flat out not wanted and Bo pretty much tells him that's how life rolls and they should just be free. Also how in 2 everyone risked their lives to save Woody and it's weird to see everyone let Woody go. The Toy Story series always had this sense of family and friends always being there together Idk, I just feel like 4 just undermines the series. My 2 cents.

etawqss,"It was certainly well made, and there was clearly a lot of effort, care and love put into it, but I really just didn't enjoy the story. It felt like an entertaining but bizarre and out of character Woody and Bo Peep fanfic. I think Toy Story 3 was the perfect sequel, and I was pretty unsatisfied with the ending of Toy Story 4. Plus seeing all the old toys getting completely sidelined for the new characters really upset me. Yes the new characters were entertaining enough, but they weren't developed enough for me to actually care about them, and I would have rather had more time spent with the toys I grew up watching as a kid, and still want to see more of. Buzz Lightyear was my favorite character growing up as a child, and treating him as an idiotic side character really just rubbed me the wrong way.

It's not a terrible film, but I am a bit confused why so many people seem to be getting so much out of it.",c2ntqo
etc4a66,"It makes sense, the only thing more heartbreaking than Woody being separated from Andy is Woody being separated from Buzz (and co.). Yet, at the end I was willing Woody to stay back with Bo, even with tears in my eyes. (Basically, Woody pulled a Cap: after a life of doing for others, he chose something for himself, after making sure everything else was squared away). 

It was a visually stunning, brilliant, funny, tender movie, that further cemented Woody himself as the true heart of the saga.

I'm a little sad that Buzz took sort of a step back from centre stage, plot-wise and emotionally, as I loved Toy Story especially as a story of ultimate friendship. Over time though it evolved into a story about growing up, maturity and freedom - letting go and moving on.",c2ntqo
ettesqf,"I'm upset for a multitude of reasons. For one, Woody's relationship with the other toys was completely ignored or left out. Buzz is supposed to be Woody's best friend but is really just a second thought. Woody loved Andy in the 3rd film, but loved his friends more, to the extent of which he donated himself with all his friends to Bonnie instead of going to college with Andy. Yet, he just leaves them behind willy nilly to become a ""lost"" toy. If Andy was so important to him, why did Woody dump all of his memories of Andy by walking away from Bonnie??? What happens when Andy comes home to visit and discovers Bonnie lost his most beloved toy?

This is the same Woody that was willing to spend years in the attic just because he wanted to be there for Andy. This is the same Woody that nearly died several times over to rescue his friends from the day care. Where was the Jessie and Buzz love interest? Why wasn't Buzz trying to talk Woody out of this like the museum? This movie was so out of character for everyone (Bo, especially). I get that maybe Bonnie didn't hold Woody to the same esteem as Andy but come on. This movie spits on the franchise that I've come to love and have been watching for the last 14 years.

One other thing I haven't even touched on yet is Gabby. She tried to trap Woody. She kidnapped and held Forky hostage. She manipulated Forky into getting information about Woody, which she then used to manipulate Woody into donating his voice box to her. She's supposed to be the villain, yet I'm supposed to feel bad for her when she's tossed aside? And be happy for her when she gets her kid? I'm sorry, no. The connection there was about as strong as Woody and Buzz's friendship felt in the film.

I can't stress how disappointed I am after watching it. After Toy Story 3, which made me laugh, cry, and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire film, I really expected much better from Pixar, yet this one left me feeling empty. If I had to find something positive, I would say I liked Woody's need to jump into the backpack and check on Bonnie in Kindergarten, plus Woody trying to protect Forky while everyone else seeing him as trash was fitting. The movie had a promising start and went downhill. The scene where the toys tried to get the dad arrested was pretty funny. Overall though, I'm not happy with the film.",c2ntqo

Even with Jessie having the sheriff badge, it‚Äôs hard to imagine Bonnie‚Äôs bedroom without Woody, like the majority of the time when she‚Äôs at school, they would be in the room interacting amongst themselves??

et8pzpa,"wow I think the ending was bittersweet, I felt bad when Woody went with Bo but I think this movie is made more for those who grew up with the franchise than for the little children in themselves, I'm 19 I grew up watching toy story and my parents They were younger than I am now when the first movie was released, although we took my little brother we went to see her more for ourselves than for him, what I understood from the final scene is that no matter how much you love your friends Sometimes you just need to move forward and close stages, you will carry them in your heart forever, they will simply not be physically with you, having finished school recently that scene hit some sensitive fibers, I still talk to my friends and we go out every now and then but all we made new friends and we are making our own way, obviously it is an animated film and although it is ridiculous, it hurt me the idea that they would never communicate again in my headcanon Woody know the phone number or email of Bonny's family and they can communicate again.

etvmzpb,"I found it difficult to enjoy this movie. There were a number of significant flaws, particularly characterization that was either sloppy, Flanderization or severely inconsistent with earlier incarnations.

&#x200B;

Let's start with Woody. Working backwards, the ending where he decided to become a lost toy clashes mightily with his personality traits. To put it bluntly, the story arc didn't lead to this point of abandonment. While the official synopsis may claim there was a two year gap since Andy donated the crew to Bonnie, the events in the film didn't quite support this, particularly how Woody continued to behave as if he were the room boss, such as attempting to upstage Dolly during the meeting scene. It's highly doubtful that Woody would take this long to acclimate to his new role, especially since stated in the film he's over 50 years old at this point and was likely the toy of, at minimum, one other kid before Andy. Further, his being left in the closet over one play session came to a huge surprise to him, indicating that either:

&#x200B;

a. He was a regularly chosen toy by Bonnie up to this point.

&#x200B;

or

&#x200B;

b. He just got there.

&#x200B;

Had the film set itself up not with the pointless rescue scene of RC (thrown in there just to get screen time to justify tie-in merch, more on this later) but a montage of Bonnie slowly forgetting Woody even existed and eventually gathering dust in the corner of the closet, Woody's actions would have made more sense. However, the way the action panned out, it made it feel like Woody was petty and vindictive over being left out of a single play session. This Woody came off as one that would have walked off into the sunset a half-hour into the original Toy Story film. It felt like all of his character development over the course of three films was erased with a last second, out of left field decision to join the lost toy brigade. Hell, even his speech to Forky during the course of the film itself pointed at Woody hanging around even though he wasn't the top choice anymore since it was his duty to be there.

&#x200B;

Essentially, Forky took on the role of Buzz from the first film - the new toy that the kid fawns over. Woody had no indication he was totally forgotten to justify running off, especially since his very identity for a half century was to be a child's play thing. He was all, ""You know, fuck it. You took my badge. I'm outta here."" The only character consistency I could see with Woody is trading over his voice box to Gabby.

&#x200B;

Next is Buzz. Oh, poor Buzz. Just like Woody, you had three film's worth of character development completely wiped away. Someone must have pushed his reset button because, after a decade of existence, Buzz still seemed to struggle with the concept that he isn't a space ranger. He was not only severely Flanderized, he even turned into a literal deus ex machina. His refusal to admit his origins in the original film not only came back but were turned up to 11. When the writers (there were 8 of them, to give you an idea of how interested Pixar was in making this thing) were stuck, they just had Buzz poke his sound effects and, magically, it always led him right to where he needed to be to bail Woody out of a jam. Buzz, who showed wisdom and intelligence in 2 and 3, suddenly regressed into a complete idiot who thought a conscious was his voice box. I was half expecting him at this point to try and call Star Command and confuse a random person walking by as mission control.

&#x200B;

Gabby Gabby, I honestly didn't have a problem with this character, other than the excessive villain motif attached for no good reason. The motivations and behavior of Gabby were surprisingly consistent and logical; toys have a strong instinct to play out their role. Since Gabby was defective out of the box and immediately discarded, the desperation she showed to obtain the part to fix her defect was understandable. However, the sense she was set up as some kind of evil dictator of the antique shop was overboard. Her motivation was to find a working voice box from a toy made around her era to replace a defective part, not be toy Hitler. The shop cat was more than sufficient to justify the broken toys hanging out in the pinball machine, not set up a weird ventriloquist dummy gestapo. This character, who could have been portrayed much more favorably, was made cartoonishly evil just because somewhere along the line Pixar decided Toy Story 4 needed a legit villain. Lotso was already pushing it, Gabby drove it off the deep end. ""Insane"" is not a trait of a good villain. This really wiped out any sympathy at the end for this character as it felt like the happy ending was undeserved.

&#x200B;

I also didn't have much of a problem with Bo, especially since she found a creative way to satisfy her instincts while doing so in a way that avoided the pain of abandonment. The underlying problem, though, is the setup was way too similar to the daycare in 3 and wasn't developed all that much, mainly to avoid it being too much of a retread of the prior film. The actual result, distributing toys to kids from a shady carnival operator, may have been a feel-good, in the moment decision, but that wouldn't last too long as the carnival operators would have quickly figured out the toy booth was pulling a tremendous financial loss and closed it, leaving Woody and Bo without anything to do. That plot path was pretty dumb.

&#x200B;

I feel the whole Forky setup was wasted. Sure, there was an existential crisis over his role and existence, which Woody only managed to change his mind via brow beating it into Forky (and then immediately forgot his own lesson and ran away). The real wasted potential here was the fact that his introduction signified that Earth is populated by over seven billion Gods capable of casually creating life out of nothing. This is the closest the films ever got to addressing this huge elephant in the room and what did they do with it? A throw-away mid-credit joke. Wow, good job with that setup, guys.

&#x200B;

Finally, the rest of the gang. I'm struggling to figure out why any of them were there save to serve as an attempt to manufacture a tear with the final goodbye. Bonnie didn't show much affection for the likes of Slinky Dog or Mr. Potato Head, yet they were scooped up and brought along anyway. I'm struggling to recall any meaningful dialogue by these characters with Potato and Slinky dipping into sound archives for a single catch phrase. I get it for Don Rickles, who had passed as an homage, but why Slinky? Why Rex or Trixie? Did Dolly even come along, I can't even remember. For whatever reason, of all the toys in the room, Andy's entire donated collection came along. Their presence was neither logical in-universe (a harried parent isn't going to scour the entire room and grab a whole lot of really specific toys) nor served a plot function other than to say, ""Bye Woody, gonna miss ya.""

&#x200B;

They all felt crammed in there by the Disney merchandising team. ""Guys,"" they said to Pixar, ""We can't market and sell a porcelain Bo Peep doll, Woody, Buzz, a 50s era talking doll and a creepy ventriloquist. You gotta add all characters from previous films so we can get the Toy Story 4 branded items on the shelves. It's quaint your previous film made $1 billion at the box office - the merch made $10 billion."" It felt that Disney wasn't really asking Pixar to make a decent film but to mandating a marketing campaign to push toy and t-shirt sales. So in went the claw machine aliens, Rex, Slinky, Hamm, the Potato Heads, Ducky, Bunny and the rest, rendering Toy Story 4 as little more than an hour and forty minute toy commercial.

&#x200B;

At the end, it never felt like Pixar really cared to make this film. As previously mentioned, the movie had eight writers and multiple rewrites over the course of its development. The first and second had four while the third had three. The entire time I watched this film, I got the impression that the writers really didn't want to be doing this. They finished off the series with the third film and tied it up. There was also a subtle nudge to Disney, ""See? Andy gave away the toys, the series is over."" This one was even more blatant, ""OK. Now Woody ran away and Bonnie's favorite toy is a spork. Quit asking us for more sequels, we want to work on our own projects like Soul and Onward.""

&#x200B;

In a way, I feel bad for the writers lower on the totem pole at Pixar. Looking at the box office returns and suspecting the merchandise sales are just as tremendous, they'll be stuck handing off the hot potato that is Toy Story 5 around the office, looking for new ways they can send a message they don't want to make Toy Story movies anymore without literally plopping out a turd and hiring Larry the Cable Guy to voice the Mater toy and focus on him.",c2ntqo

f1hxpke,"i'm just mad at Boonie for treating Woody like that after Andy told her how much woody meant to him.

i just keep imagining the scene from Toy Story 3 where she finds him in the box and goes ""My cowboy!"" and Andy recoils a little when she reaches to grab him and then tells her how much woody means to him and gives woody to her and she hugs woody.

and then the scene from this movie where she grabs him, take his sheriff badge and throws him away.

and if you're thinking ""she's just a kid"", when someone gave me something important as a kid and told me to take care of it you bet i'm gonna treat it with extreme respect and care. it's less about hurting a toy's (woody's) feelings and more about Andy giving her something that was very important to him.",c2ntqo

While TS3 is recognized as the perfect conclusion of the series, I feel that it left character complexes about Woody.

What happens when *Bonnie* grows up, is Woody just going to have to go through this all over again? It felt loose for the heart and soul of the series, Woody. Andy was *his* kid.

But it seems so wrong, since the end of Toy Story 3, Andy was so hesitant to hand over Woody, because it was so special to him, but chose give the toy that gave him happy memories for Bonnie to look after. And here, she completely forgets Woody.

According to Disney Wiki, Woody is 15.18 inches tall. Assuming he walks at about the same speed as an average human, that means to retrieve Forky for Bonnie, he walked for seven and a half hours, took 46,428 steps, and burned over 2000 calories.",c2ntqo

I'm still happy the movie exists. It's a worthy successor to Toy Story 3; the deep existential matters this movie explored were so inappropriate for a kids' movie but so great.

He almost went to college with Andy but decided to stay with his friends then. I get Bonnie didn't need him but that seemed like convenience to play with literally every toy but him, especially after Andy emphasized his importance and how he'll always be there for you.

It also felt so repetitive. We've already done the plots of whether to stay with one kid or play with a bunch/be free, as well as getting separated/jumping out of the car and needing to get back, and the threatening toy in the new environment.

Probably the oddest thing to me was Buzz listening to his ""inner voice"" (which was a hilarious gag) and leaving Woody to find Forky alone. Again, I get that that's the point; that they're meant to be independent from each other eventually, but it's oddly out of character for Buzz to let his best bud go back to the antique shop alone.

So I guess that the film is about Woody finding his real purpose? By bringing happiness to every toy (and to every kid, to some extent), he's doing what a ""mature"" toy would do: let the other toys get their fun.

The emotional impact isn't as gut wrenching as Toy Story 3. Nothing beats that gut wrenching scene in the incinerator, where a bunch of toys realized they will die. Or the goodbye scene between Andy and the gang which represents, in my opinion, our own goodbye to our childhood. Maybe Woody and Buzz's separation means growing up means growing apart from our own friends, as well? Whatever the intended message was, I found that it didn't resonate with me as much as I thought it would.

So what's next to the series? They've now dealt with many themes involving toys. If there's a fifth sequel (I wish there won't be), I guess they could actually deal with death again. Like Bo Peep shattering or something. But I guess that would be too dark.",c2ntqo

Toy Story is really Woody's story. He is always fighting his insecurities at every step. In the first movie he learns that being the favorite isn't always the best thing for everyone else. He overcomes his jealousy and gains an important friend. 

In the second movie he helps another friend realize that being played with and finding love again is worth it over being appreciated behind a glass panel. Toys are meant to be played with.

In the third movie he has to say goodbye to his lifelong pal Andy because it's Andy's choice to grow and move on.

In this movie he realizes that he doesn't really have a special place in Bonnie's heart but his sense of human pleasing toy self is so deeply ingrained that he is always trying to control the situation instead of taking a step back to see the bigger picture. Both him and Forky have a crisis of identity. Woody can't see himself without a human until the idea is reinforced by Bo Peep. He takes a chance to find happiness for himself that is not dependent on a human.",c2ntqo
esb9v0d,"I am really fascinated by movies that have substantial re-writes, which was very publicly the case here. They teased a character ‚ÄúLulu‚Äù, a Hawaiian paper doll at D23 and EuroCinema, but I can‚Äôt find anything else online. Anyone know?",c2ntqo
esjvchb,"Glad this thread was made and I could at least see what other people who saw it had to say. I went to see it by myself on a holiday (Canada Day, so Duke Caboom was a great surprise) and there were maybe 6 people in the theatre for the last show of the night. None of my friends would see a movie like this so it's hard to find people to discuss it with.

I went to the same theatre I went to see Toy Story 2 as a kid with my family, but now as an adult. I grew up with these toys and it was one of the only movies that perfectly captured my experience growing up with toys of my own who I would name, put away, and take on adventures. I waited 3 years before finally watching Toy Story 3 because I knew the ending would mean coming to terms with a farewell to my own collection which had already been packed away in basement storage for some time.

I would've liked to see more screen time for Woody & Buzz together, but I agree it was more about wrapping up Woody's story; that being said, their final hug was powerful and could've had a little bit more. It was like saying goodbye to a real life best friend you originally thought would be there for every chapter. I related a lot to Woody in TS4...always putting the needs of others before my own and finding purpose and value by being there for someone else. The final scene was a very emotional moment where Woody said a bittersweet farewell to the life and family he had known for so long and hello to the life he always thought he had to set aside.

Pixar and especially Toy Story will always be one of the best to ever do it in my opinion when it concerns telling a story that touches viewers in all sorts of ways exactly when they need it. There's something for everyone in their films. Thank you from a lifelong fan.",c2ntqo
et8c97w,"Just saw it with my 2 year old which was very cool in itself considering the first one came out when I was 4. So between us we may have seen all the toy stories dozens of times with her definitely carrying the bulk of the viewings. 

Anyway, I loved this movie. It was funny and incredibly well made visually. A lot of people seem to not like the way the characters were treated, which was understandable, but this was a Woody story more than a Toy Story. I didn‚Äôt need a lot of stuff from the other toys because they weren‚Äôt the ones going through the existential crisis. They were all happy and Woody knew that. 

I think it was great and completely within his character to leave with Bo after he left her the first time to be with Andy. He realized that kids eventually grow up and grow out of their toys and it took Woody being replaced by Jessy and Forky to see that. It was killing him inside but he always put Bonnie first. When he met Bo again she taught him that there‚Äôs so much more out there and he‚Äôll never get the same bond he got with Andy from Bonnie anyway. 

This movie just felt right to me. It was about growth and self-love this time when the toy stories have always been about being self-less. The Gabi Gabi plot tied it all up very nicely to me too.",c2ntqo

It would have been nice to have her acknowledge the shift in behaviour instead of it feeling exaggerated just for the audience's sake.",c2ntqo
erxnfyr,"I think this was the best one yet. 

Key and Peele stole the show for me, and I think Reeves character was great. 

I liked how it seemed a bit more... Adult than the rest. Some of the jokes were a little darker and it felt like the franchise itself was growing with me, seeing as I saw the first one when I was 5.  

All the Toy Story movies at their core ask the same question ""How do you cope, when someone you love stops loving you"" 

And I feel like this was the only one to finally answer that for Woody. 

The first movie Woody feared being left for another. 

In the second Woody dealt with the dilemma ""How can someone love me if I'm broken?""

And in the 3rd he is left with ""How do I cope when a loved one leaves me behind?""

What I loved about the 4th one is that the question finally comes 
with an answer. 

You live your own life, you find your own purpose.",c2ntqo
es252jl,"Alright hot take: the reason people aren‚Äôt crazy about it is because it wasn‚Äôt really made for them. My theatre was full of young parents with kids around bonnies age. They were kids when the original movie came out. There were also a lot of older people there. That were probably young parents when it came out.

Toy story was the original pixar movie and my parents claim pixar movies like toy story and finding nemo were so good because the only kids movies made for both parents and kids.

In case it wasn‚Äôt already obvious to you: the toys are supposed to be parents. Woody‚Äôs like a dad that‚Äôs watched his kid grow up, done everything right, even has grandkids, but he realizes he‚Äôs not needed anymore and Bo Peep is all the stuff he gave up to raise his family. Toy story 4 makes it pretty obvious that ‚Äúhaving a kid‚Äù isn‚Äôt the most important thing in the world. The lost toys get their happy ending, they help toys outside their family, decide that doll doesn‚Äôt need to be brought home to their version of having a kid, and go on their own adventures. Meanwhile, forky and bonnies toys are all starting the cycle over.

In conclusion, Toy Story is about parenthood and getting or not getting there. Woody‚Äôs an empty nester that dedicated his whole life to being a good parent and now he‚Äôs lost. Bo Peep is someone that didn‚Äôt have the picture-esque parental experience and represents finding happiness after it‚Äôs cut short from a death, divorce, etc. The creepy doll is someone who never found a partner while they were young or middle aged, and she opts for what‚Äôs basically adopting a child in need. And i got bad news for you if you‚Äôre the average redditor, which is a man between the ages of 15-30: You‚Äôre Forky. Yes, you‚Äôre the unimpressive, dumb spork, that loves trash, and needs analogies from smarter people to understand what it means to be a good person and a parent. Yet you‚Äôre still loved by family and friends, even though everything you like is trash.",c2ntqo
esc0372,I understand where people are coming from saying the ending is inconsistent with the first 3 movies.

esplnl5,"I rewatched 1, 2, & 3 this week in prep for 4.

1 & 2 were so good and funny, 3 didn't have as much humor but the ending perfectly wrapped up the trilogy.

I was disappointed with 4, it lacked the witty dialogue and interaction between the main toys (Hamm, Rex, Potato Head), and it lacked the ""adventure/heist"" feel the others had. Also I wasn't happy with Woody's ending as it goes against what he learned in the previous films.",c2ntqo

errsu7z,"I'm conflicted about this movie. On one hand, I think it's beautifully animated, well-scripted and a good film in and of itself. However, I did not like the way that it reneged on Toy Story 3's ending.  


 It's established thorughout 1-3, at least for me, that Woody really wants to keep the group together. In 3 he even says that the job of the  group is to be there for Andy, even it it means being in the attic.   


More than that, Andy asks if Bonnie is going to take good care of Woody and she agrees. I know she's a little kid, but it doesn't seem right that soon after this, she confines Woody to the closet. It also seems weird that Woody would have such a reaction to being left in the closet, given that he was perfectly willing to go into attic mode at the beginning of Toy Story 3. I was extremely sad when Toy Story 4 ended, but it wasn't the same sadness as I felt when Toy Story 3 ended.   


In that movie, I felt both pain and joy for the loss of Andy and the beginning of a new era for the group. In this one I felt very empty because the heart of the group was gone and their family unit is ruined.   


Other parts of the movie...I liked the plushie duo a lot. Gabby could have been an extremely effective, scary villain. I didn't buy her heel-face turn, because she still essentially mutilated Woody and only offered the voicebox back when she didn't get what she wanted. She would have ripped that voicebox out if she could have, so yeah, she's a sinister individual. As I said, I'm conflicted.

AMAZING EVERYTHING LOOKS

like seriously, Pixar, everyone who helped design this film, you guys are animation/film gods

Lighting, Animation, Shading, Models, Textures, etc. were all 10/10

I was telling my mom how crazy the details were in this movie and how the quality of animation has changed over the years. I read on here that this movie was more of a ‚Äúwoody spin off‚Äù which is very true since we hardly get a few lines from the original cast of toys. 

This film and those prior have had a fantastic influence on my childhood and to this day I can still highly appreciate the themes and morals the story conveys in every film. 

This one in particular seemed to ring the same bell as the Pixar Short ‚Äúbao‚Äù a heart warming story of a mother going through ‚Äúempty nest syndrome‚Äù  (I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs an actual term). 

Ugh. I love this movie because it always bothered me that we didn‚Äôt know of Bo‚Äôs disappearance in TS3 and she was as important of a character to me as Buzz.

I miss Andy. 

Okay, I don‚Äôt have anything against Bonnie but I was a little taken aback at how she LOVED Woody so much in Toy Story 3, it really felt like she had an attachment to him and then she hardly cared about him in this film. I also didn‚Äôt like how the OG toys didn‚Äôt get much screen time. 

What I did like was Forky, he was great and probably my favorite new character, he was really fun and I grew to love him. I also liked seeing Bo. It was interesting to explore what happens to a lost toy. The antique shop was a really cool environment, I enjoyed exploring that.

&#x200B;

The movie felt focused on just three areas.

&#x200B;

The beginning, the antique store, and the carnival area.

&#x200B;

The 1:40 screentime went by fast, but I felt like a lot didn't actually happen. It was kind of sad to see most the main characters I grew up with have very minor roles as well.

&#x200B;

I enjoyed the movie though, but I'm not sure if I like it more than Toy Story 3 or even Toy Story 1.

Woody's arc was sort of selfish. Now that he's not the main toy, he decides to be a lost toy. Now, he is still heroic in the sense he did everything he could for Bonnie for forky, and he said its because he feels lost not being the main toy.. But what if Bonnie wants to play with Woody, and he's gone? Is that going to be the plot of Toy Story 5?

Woody's whole character has been that you be there for your owner when they need you, period. Only your owner decides when they're done with you (Andy with Toy Story 3, even if Woody did dupe him into thinking those were to be donated per Mom and not just the attic.) You don't just quit on your owner. Especially in Toy Story 3, that was his whole thing. Guys, we are here FOR ANDY when he needs us. But now that he's not the big shot with Bonnie, he goes rebel.

When they fail to get Forky the first time in the Antique Shop, and Woody says he's going back for him because he doesn't leave people behind, and Buzz says ""He just left me behind."" It did have a valid point. Woody was willing to sacrifice any helpers just for Forky, and Woody can't appreciate just being a toy for a kid to use when they want and having the companionship of the other toys.

In the end Woody gives Jessie the sheriff badge, which could have been a much more touching moment than it was. She should have had a much bigger role in the whole plan (and the movie in general) so that the toys and the viewer can see how much she's earned it. Woody rescued her in TS2 so if Jessie took the reigns here to help Woody, and Forky by extension, then her arc would have come full circle and she would be perfect to take over.

I also feel there was an absence of jokes. I don't mean jokes I laughed at but jokes in general. There were a few here and there but nothing compared to previous movies.

I just feel that the story was a step below Toy Story 3 though and I think that some of the new characters deserved a bit more space.

2:34 alludes to how he never gives up on her and that Woody will be there for her no matter what, and this is shown in 4 where he goes to Kindergarten with her and helps her make a friend, Forky, even though she lost interest in him. 

Maybe a huge stretch, but in a way she did take care of Woody, as requested by Andy at 2:48, just not in the caring sense. She took care of him as in dealt with him in a way that would lead to the events of him reuniting with Bo and getting over Andy. She takes care of that all right, getting him where he needs to be.

I would have preferred Woody, Bo and Gabby go with Bonnie, but that would have probably been too safe of an ending. This also makes future films difficult if they continue to make more(I hope not). Woody and Buzz being separated like that is a hard concept for me to accept.

erow952,For me the parting of Woody and Buzz felt right and was handled all-but perfectly. Woody already knew what he should do and Buzz accepted the choice of his friend (a choice he deeply wished for him) in such a mature and straightforward way. That‚Äôs what made me cry - the simplicity of that scene. It felt very real to me. Very familiar. And very grown up. It was a scene for those who grew up (or just grew) with these characters. This series has consistently surprised with its emotional ambition. Part 4 was no exception. That final scene knew that often so much is said with so very little. It knew that we all understood the weight of the moment. Its subtlety was our reward for having gone on so big a journey.,c2ntqo

Toy Story 3 was about the end of childhood, and passing that childlike joy on. Now, a few years later comes a movie about figuring out who and what you are, and making tough decisions to get you where you need to be. I loved it.

I honestly still view the first three as a trilogy, and this latest one as a stand-alone film, but I loved it. And I don‚Äôt remember the last time I laughed as hard as I did for the plush-rush.",c2ntqo

erubahm,"I think I'm in the minority, but I actually was a little disappointed by this film. I knew when I walked into the theater how the film would end, and even though I teared up when it happened, I felt more manipulated than legitimately moved. I feel like Woody's decision to leave the gang needed better explanation - sure, he liked Bo Peep, but doesn't he like all his friends? What makes her different? The answer is obviously the relationship between the two of them, but most of that interaction is in one-off glances or short scenes, rather than the crux of the movie. I felt like the movie needed to show me that Bo mattered enough to leave literally everything and everyone he knew behind, and I didn't get that when I watched it. 

I'm also being a bit cynical because the set dressing was too hyperrealistic for the character design, the cat was uncanny valley for me, and I didn't like the business of the plot. I felt like if we focused less on the Key-and-Peele comic relief/Buzz plotline/Gabby plotline/Forky plotline roulette, we could have more interaction between Woody and Bo, and getting to re-know Bo Peep as a character beyond ""tough action girl with a past"".

Things I did like:

* The entire opening sequence. Brilliantly shot, great use of Chekov's lights, amazing acting from both Tom Hanks and the character animators, the highlight of the movie for me.
* Woody getting to know Forky while walking to the RV - fun, poignant, and a good subtle plot point for later.
* The orchestration throughout, especially at the end, was on point and beautiful to listen to.

Also, did anyone else feel like Bo Peep was animated really similarly to Elsa? Not just in the hair/costume design/eye shape, but some of her facial expressions and arm gestures gave me deja vu to Elsa's performance.",c2ntqo

You could tell it was going to be about Woody's relevance and existentialism in general within the first 10 minutes.

Woody wants to love and be loved while Forky takes some warming to it.

Movie was absolutely hilarious. Undoubtably moreso than any other movie in the franchise. 

I like to view this movie more as a Woody spinoff because it leaves most of the main characters untouched, but i‚Äôm okay with that

I don‚Äôt think I need to say how good this movie looked

Gabby Gabby was an awesome ‚Äòvillain‚Äô. Both times I watched the theatre let out an audible ‚Äúoooooh...‚Äù when Harmony rejected her

Nobody seems to have mentioned this but I love how the movie doesn‚Äôt pretend like they neglected Bo for the entirety of Toy Story 3. The recurring gag with woody forgetting the sheep‚Äôs names was hilarious

 Forky is such a sweet enduring character. Totally thought he would be annoying but he was actually very genuinely funny and his naive nature made him so likeable.

Like, ""oh, so I entrusted you with my most beloved toy that was my steadfast companion and friend throughout my entire childhood, who has (albeit unbeknownst to me) overcome nearly insurmountable feats just to stay by my side and ensure my happiness all these years, and you didn't even keep him for more than what, ONE YEAR before losing him?""

eu6ot7n,"I thought Toy Story 4 was phenomenal! I love the changes of character development, and I also love how the antagonist had a change of mind. She was a layered sympathetic character and that was exactly what made her unique compared to other Toy Story characters that either became evil or stayed villainous. They made Bo-Peep a very strong character in this chapter, which was also great for Woody's differences and the plot's own story development. The only considerable flaws I noticed were based on the small use of other characters that were previously major in past installments now gone minor in supporting (besides Buzz and Jessie) . Very minor to bit actually, which is too common. Luckily those flaws were saved by comedic brainstorming segments that made their performances worthwhile unlike most sequels that try similar things, as the same with introducing likeable new characters with distinguishable personalities which made the film another breath of fresh air.  I was at the edge of my seat. Don't get me started on the tears. As someone who acts and is a thespian, the greatest thing that I noticed that Disney/Pixar have been able to accomplish through the 'Toy Story' franchise is to capture the feeling of being a child who cares about what they lost, other characters facing a fear of possible changes in that child and the relief of something being returned to the child. Poetically, this movie took another route and based itself on the controversial terms of replacement, preference and the relief of accepting reassurance. In the end, it represented those attributes gracefully in my opinion! 9/10",c2ntqo
iesv7nq,"I am a little late but here's my opinion:

All the things they have built up in part 1-3 was now made for none.

In every part they made it clear what the mission of a toy is.
And now they changed it, so that toys want to live alone and explore the world?

What annoys me the most is, that this movie killed the ending of toy story 3, which was my favorite.
Andy tells bonnie that woody is his favrotie toy, hes really precious to him, and the developers decide to make bonnie stop liking him in part 4.


Not what I wanted. Not happy. 

For me toy story ended with part 3.",c2ntqo
es8jemc,"I really, really wanted to like this movie, but it was just off somehow. Way too much focus on Woody and trying to convey some message about getting over the past. Definitely didn't hit as deep or as sweetly as the other movies, especially 3 (which honestly I think I would have preferred it stopped at.) #3 was a very similar message that life changes or moves on, so I don't know why they felt the need to try to repeat that? I wanted to enjoy screentime from the other toys too! It felt like a contrived cash grab with a couple of funny jokes.

Buzz seemed to go from a lovable cornball to a dumbass. Bo is somehow completely fine with Woody up and leaving Andy on a whim for the sake of staying with her (regarding the intro scene.) Woody wasn't very dynamic, just, ""I'm stuck in the past, wah. üò¢"" I can't even say much for the other toys because their screentime was so minimal.

My favorite part was probably Forky, and the fluffy unicorn bent on getting the dad arrested.

Edit: OK one last thing... Gabby is basically a psychopath who was willing to kill or at least manipulate something out of another toy for her own benefit, but then after she pulls her sadistic stunt, they take pity on her so she can experience the beauty of ""having a kid""?

es39q1g,"I'm honestly shocked to see so many on this thread that disliked it. I also feel like some of the criticisms are a bit on a surface level though. I say that because there are things in this movie that probably shouldn't have worked because on paper they wouldn't, but the execution was still so great that these things did work. I also believe this movie needs to be looked at from a certain angle.

It's an epilogue. It's not the ""ending"" of the series, that was still #3. I felt like the series has always had 2 different focuses. One focus being on Woody, the main character; and then the next focus on Buzz/rest of the gang. My one minor complaint with #4 (while watching) was that it felt like the supporting characters (Buzz included) were heavily sidelined in this. But then it dawned on me. Their story ended in #3. That's why for the most part, we didn't feel like a 4th movie was even necessary. Woody however still had some story left, and this is that story. If the trilogy was about being there for your friends, the 4th movie is about finally being able to do something for yourself and finding new meaning. So in retrospect, I'm sort of glad they didn't ""force"" anything on the other characters, because that would have risked ruining the ending of the 3rd movie. Though I do wish there was a moment where Jessie was shown to completely understand Forky's significance to Bonnie, as that would have made her being the new Sheriff a bit more meaningful. However it's obvious that both Buzz and Jessie understand this significance and will continue to be the leaders the gang need and deserve. I felt Woody passing on the badge was still a beautiful moment.

All that said, this movie still effed me up. I had a bulge in my throat for what felt like at least 70% of the movie. There was terrific humor too. By the end of it, I was happy that the movie felt like it had a purpose, even if it felt like a minor stretch. I didn't need a Toy Story 4, but I'm also not mad that it was made either.

Even just typing this, I feel emotional. Woody and Buzz were best friends. I felt physical pain watching the ending. It hurt, but it made sense. Kind of reminded me of the ending to Return of the King where Frodo felt he had to leave and the hardest challenge was saying goodbye to Sam. I keep telling myself they won't lose touch. Toy Story 3 showed them IM'ing and receiving letters from the daycare toys in the credits. I have to keep telling myself a similar form of communication will exist between Woody/Bo and all of Bonnie's toys so that I don't feel TOO sad by this ending.

It's easy to see disappointment from the ensemble angle, but it should be kept in mind that Woody has always been the largest focus from the start. The 1st movie is about coming to terms with the new kid on the block, realizing that he shouldn't be so selfish and that it's more about Andy. There will always be something new and neither Woody or Buzz will always be the ""favorite"". The second film is about realizing that the time you have with your loved ones isn't exactly permanent, but you should hold onto it all for as long as you can before finding that new purpose. The third film is about staying together for when that time does come where a new purpose is forced to be found. The 4th is about Woody realizing that maybe that new life isn't the one he wants anymore, and after years of keeping everyone together successfully, he feels in his heart that he has yet another new purpose. It comes full circle. Being selfish got him in trouble in the 1st film, yet in the 4th, his friends give him the okay to be a little selfish, to put himself first for a change- because they know it's a decision that will be good for him. He passes on his leadership role and begins his new journey, while the others continue to serve their purpose as Bonnie's toys.",c2ntqo

Best Pixar sequel since Toy Story 3- not that that says much, but this is genuinely good where everything else except Cars 3 was really mediocre and pointless in their respective universes. 

Monsters Uni, Dory and Incredibles 2 were really poor efforts. Cars 2 was horrific and the only reason Cars 3 is decent is that it makes up for the second film. It's safe but it advances the plot and characters more than any of these bunch.",c2ntqo

Pizza Planet Truck - tattoo on guy‚Äôs leg

Pixar ball - I think one of the cups by ducky/bunny at the carnival

The Shining - Old lady sits in tub with background exactly like The Shining. Lee Unkrich, director of TS3, had a part in that. It‚Äôs his favorite movie.

Up - The sheep try to hand Bo a grape bottle cap.

Lifted and Wally B (shorts) - book titles at one point.

ertvguu,"I thought this was definitely the worst of the bunch, thought that's not saying much. I'd give Toy Story a 10, Toy Story 2 a 9, number 3 a 9.5, and the fourth one an 8.5. I liked that Disney/Pixar made our ""villain"" not so transparent and gave them a really sweet redemption with the lost child. But I didn't think she was given too much screen time and was just kinda there. I feel like the split of attention between Woody and Bo's story and Gabby's story were fighting for the limelight. I also didn't like some aspects of the script too much. Buzz, in the first third, didn't seem like Buzz. He felt like he was dumbed down to help kickstart the ""inner voice"" message. He wasn't always as smart as Woody but he was never that dumb. Also, the final goodbye was SO CLOSE to being perfect. If they just moved a few things around it could have been much more emotionally in line with the last 3 movies. If Buzz didn't say Bonnie and him and Woody just shared a look of understanding, I think that would have been more powerful than spelling it out. And the last ""To Infinity and Beyond"" I just didn't like. I really feel like it should have been on the carousel instead of while the two were too far apart to hear. 

But I had a good time and Forky was pretty fun. Key and Peele's plans were fucking hilarious. And everyone brought their A-Game with the voice acting and the animation. Even though some lines or some reads were ehhhhhhh, everyone tried as hard as they could.",c2ntqo

After traveling through endless canyons of garbage at night they see multicolored twinkling lights shining like beacon.  They head down into the clearing and find the carousel in perfect working condition with a thriving city of 'lost' toys spreading out from it.  Cue heartfelt reunion between Buzz, Woody, Bo Peep and the gang.  But then!  Suddenly the ground rumbles as the sound of tank treads gets closer.  Jesse and Buzz square up for the fight of their life...  only for the approaching threat to turn out to be Wall-E.

I thought this movie was going to be about a sporks existential crisis, with the meaning of life, and the cycle of life and death, but it was just a movie about a rescue mission. I also think Bo Peep has been gone for too long for this movies romantic ending to hit at all. I think it would've been better if it focused more on Woody convincing Forky not to kill himself only to see him be pulled apart and thrown away when Bonnie gets older, fulfilling his purpose, and then end with a montage of seeing the toys get played with different kids throughout the years while Woody and Buzz and all the other toys still have a smile on their face.

es3hb0h,"I wasn't happy to hear that they were making this but I do still think that this is a nice addition to the Toy Story saga. Maybe not as necessary as the original trilogy, but still great. I think it's main weakness, and maybe it's because I just watched the first one and haven't seen 2 or 3 in a while, but I really like that they used to focus on the toys and you'd rarely see human faces. Usually just shoulders, ankles, and stuff like that. You never saw Andy's mom's face. But there is a lot of human shots in this one, and not just kids. I feel like it keeps you in the world of toys a little more to have a lack of human faces. But that's just a small thing.

My main pro is that I think Gabby Gabby is one of the best villains of the whole series. Besides Sid obviously. We've seen toys burned by being lost or abandoned by kids before, but the darkness that exists inside of a toy that was broken to begin with is something totally new. She was truly creepy and the part worked so well. Watching her sip tea through the glass as the little girl did was really haunting. And like any great villain, you can really sympathize with her.",c2ntqo

etexihy,"I‚Äôve never been a fan of lengthy series, yet here I am, longing for Toy Story 5 to be in the makings ASAP. This entire franchise is really good, and in my opinion, none of them are better than the other ‚Äî they‚Äôre all masterpieces. 

The ending was very bittersweet to me. I‚Äôm torn between feeling happy for Woody, moving onto a new chapter of his life with Bo and the others, yet I‚Äôm still upset that the iconic duo Buzz & Woody are split. 

However there‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been bothering me about the writing. Throwback to Toy Story 3; where Lotso had been stuck in the incinerator, and Woody had dropped down to help him. Buzz instantly had his back, and helped alongside Woody. And yet, now in Toy Story 4, Buzz decided to dip when Woody wanted to head back into the Antique store. Note that Toy Story 4 takes place roughly about a year after Toy Story 3. It doesn‚Äôt seem like him? Definitely doesn‚Äôt seem like something he‚Äôd do, given how he was portrayed in the past couple of films.

Also, I‚Äôm slightly bummed out that the original cast hadn‚Äôt been given as much screen time as the newer characters. Hopefully we‚Äôll get to see them more in the upcoming short films.

Walked out of the theatre just plain upset.

erqqcr5,"God this movie just came to me at the right time in my life, just like Toy Story 3. When TS3 came out, I was just about to head to college, and it hit me deeply. 

I just turned 25 and just graduated college, and have been in a spot lately where I don't feel confident in who I am and my place in the world, just like Woody. I totally related to his story and what he was going through. 

One of Bo's lines really got to me, ""Why would I waste my time on a shelf waiting for a kid when there's a whole world out there?"" I've been thinking of moving across the country after graduation for some time, and this movie really kicked me in the ass and told me to take the chance and go for it. There's a whole world out there.",c2ntqo
eru8598,"I'm still weighing my thoughts, but for now, I just want to say that I absolutely loved this film. Like many people, I thought that Toy Story 3 was a perfect ending to the series, leading me to be skeptical of TS4 at first, but TS4 really pulls off the impossible and justifies its own existence.

 The main thing that I took away from this movie is the balls that it had in dealing with grief. It undoes that perfect conclusion from the last movie and asks ""What happens after the end?"". Woody never got over losing Andy, and that's OK. Bonnie just wasn't his kid, and that's OK too. I truly wasn't expecting that kind of emotional honesty.",c2ntqo
etf8kt8,"Toy Story was my favourite movie as a child. I was 7 when it came out. I got a woody doll and took it everywhere with me. I am now a 32 year old father of three girls. They love the first three movies as much as I do. In fact, we still have my woody doll from when the first one came out. It has been handed down child to child with the youngest now carrying it around 24/7. 

The ending really pissed me off though. Andy wanted to keep Woody and the rest of the toys but specifically Woody. Take him to college and perhaps hand him down to his own children? In the third he rightly saw that Bonnie would love, cherish and appreciate Woody as much as he did so he gave away the toy that he loved the most. 

Then to take it the direction of Bonnie not caring that he was gone or even notice. My damn heart. Don't you worry enbeay Woody, you're safe with my kids. 

Aside from that I REALLY enjoyed the movie and more importantly so did my girls. I think its time to end that particular cast. Find some new, younger and more relevant characters in the same universe.",c2ntqo

I also did not like how they dumbed down Buzz and felt like Forky was wasted potential.",c2ntqo
eros9cz,"Am I the only one who felt the end scene was a bit rushed? It's a tearful and emotional send off but it gets cut way too short.

Aside from that turning Buzz into an idiot seemed out of character and while it led to some funny jokes it just didn't really fit.

Forky was easily my favorite part of the movie, although I wish they explored more themes surrounding his strange and unexplained creation.

Key, Peele and Keanu all killed it but all the other side characters got barely any screen time which is a shame, I rewatched the previous 3 films recently and 2 and 3 did a great job giving the side characters more screen time, the way it handled the characters reminded me of the first movie.

And can I just say the animation was gorgeous, I didn't there would be that much of a difference between 3 and 4 but man it's just breathtaking how good this film looks with some great cinematography and editing.

And that post credits gag was fantastic, worth the wait.",c2ntqo
erozl3o,"The animation was probably the best I've ever seen. It was particularly noticeable in the opening scene with the rain. Just wow.

Pixar hit it out of the park with the new characters. I fell in love with all of them by the end. I do have to admit it felt weird spending so much time with them while most of the usual cast spent the entire movie in an RV across town. Honestly, Woody and Bo were the only members of the gang that didn't feel criminally underused.

The movie got a little sloppy somewhere in the second half. The characters were stuck in a loop of going back and forth between locations (the antique store and the carnival) and it started to really wear out it's welcome. It felt like they were just dragging their feet.

Overall I really enjoyed it. Probably not the best of the series, but it was still a great time.",c2ntqo
erp77h8,Poor Arctic Assault Combat Carl...,c2ntqo
erpn5de,"Oh man I was not a fan of that ending at all, I just don't see how Woody's purpose was complete when Bonnie is still a child, like yeah she hasn't played with him much lately but that doesn't mean she'll never play with him again, also the two teddy bears had the funniest parts but something that bothered me was how they were going nuts at the possibility of going with woody to have their own kid and at the end they're like ""there is your RV woody, just go and do your thing"" and it's like wait weren't you guys tagging along all this time cause you wanted to have a kid?",c2ntqo
erq1r69,"I'm not sure I agree with the sentiment that this movie throws 3's ending out the window. If 3 was about Woody learning to let go, this was an extension of that by being about finally *getting over* letting go (hell, even Forky says he doesn't think Woody truly ever got over losing Andy). They're similar ideas, but not exact. If 3 was the ending of a great book, this was a nice epilogue to seal the deal.

Did we need another film? Not really. But if we **had** to get one, I'm glad it was this one.

I don't want a fifth.",c2ntqo

It was weaker feels, but I think it makes sense.

They did Buzz dirty but they recovered it at the end with his plan, and when he said goodbye to Woody. 

I cried",c2ntqo
erul93z,"Overall I was disappointed in this movie, but it isn‚Äôt awful. I am a huge Toy Story fan and have grown up loving the movies and characters. I‚Äôll start with the cons and move to the pros:

Cons:
1. Buzz‚Äôs character. Why was one of our main protagonists in the series reduced to a running gag in this film? He was clueless, quiet, and seemed jammed into the film just to get him screen time and funny lines rather than him actually being needed to be in the movie to move the plot. 

2. Little to no screen time for the ‚Äúgang‚Äù ie Rex, Slinky, Ham, Mr and Mrs Potato Head, Jessie and Bullseye. I did enjoy the new characters, but the group we came to know and love were barely in the film. I understand there are a lot of characters in the film and they shouldn‚Äôt just be jammed into the story for the sake of it, but in TY2 and TY3 our gang all seamlessly worked together to move along the plot to the conclusion. In TY4 the made little to no impact and their goodbye to Woody in the conclusion felt rushed and unemotional. 

3. This leads into point 3: less charm and emotionality than the first three. In TY1, but especially TY2 and TY3 there were moments that completely pulled at your heart. Jessie‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhen she loved me‚Äù montage and the incinerator scene in TY3 were gripping, emotional, and brought the characters to life. Yes, Woody‚Äôs transition to no longer being the favourite toy and his acceptance of a new role in life were interesting and touching, but I don‚Äôt think adequately explored enough to really make an impact. 

4. That leads me to my final point - the very interesting themes in this movie were not adequately explored enough to make a real impact. There was too much time spent with pointless scenes for comic relief (which are great and have their place, but they over overshadowed the main issues of the film). When we finally got to the crux of Woody‚Äôs issues: when he‚Äôd sacrifice his friends‚Äô wellbeing to save Forky because he needs Forky as he no longer has a purpose with Bonnie was very thought provoking and I was excited to see that explored more...but then it was completely skirted over. 

Pros:
1. The animation was incredible. Getting to see the little  fibres on Jessie‚Äôs felt hat, the cat‚Äôs hyper realism, the opening rain scene...all were amazing feats of animation. 

2. Woody‚Äôs story arc. I thought this was a very good ending for Woody. In TY1 his biggest fear was being a lost toy and now here he is fully accepting it and bringing joy to many children through helping other toys. I thought it was fitting and made sense for his story. 

3. The themes of the movie. I thought the themes were very thought provoking and interesting for a children‚Äôs movie so that - usually Pixar fashion - it was equally as enjoyable for adults. I wish they had been further explored and developed though. 

Overall I give it a 7/10. It is a good movie, but just not a good Toy Story movie. It was beautifully animated and fun to watch, but it was an unnecessary extension to these characters‚Äô stories and did no justice to the overall story.",c2ntqo
esd8p1w,"This didn't feel like Toy Story. I loved many of the new characters and the atmosphere and everything. But this movie is missing series fundamentals.

One of the most powerful connections in Toy Story is the dynamic between Woody and Buzz. They play off of eachother so well. I have loved watching them go back and forth in all the movies. We hardly experience that iconic duo at all in this film.

The other familiar toys in general are shoved out for new characters. I want to see Slink and Ham and Potato head and many of the characters I grew up with interact more in different stories and settings. I really didn't get that.

This isn't Toy Story so I don't know why there is a 4 on the poster. This is the adventures of Woody and Bo. Maybe even a soft refresh with a different title would've helped my expectations go lower and helped them restart that franchise like it feels like they want to.

That said, this movie had me smiling for the whole thing, and the animation was top notch. The comedic writing was on point and the jokes landed well. Not even close to a bad movie, just not toy story.

8/10",c2ntqo
et68t9y,"I've seen a lot of complaints that this movie ended in a way that was against Woody's character and his general arc. 

And I really don't think that's the case. Toy Story 4 is a story about self care. Woody was doing himself harm trying to find some way to be useful to Bonnie so that he could feel like he had a purpose even if that purpose was different from the one he had with Andy.  

The thing he has valued throughout all movies most has been making a positive impact on a child's life, and secondarily ensuring the happiness of the toys around him. And he followed those values to his own detriment as seen in the prologue and through the entire  I Won't Let You Throw Yourself Away montage. 

With Gabby he saw a way he could continue to follow those values while also looking after himself. But even then he needed permission to do it. 

I think it's unfair to call his staying with Bo a selfish decision.",c2ntqo
es3wy2q,"Firstly I want to say I loved the movie. If I didn't have something to compare it to I'd have no qualms with it and as a stand alone it succeeds on so many fronts. There's a lot to tackle here so let's get started:

&#x200B;

1) Bo peep's complete change of character. Totally fine, I don't mind that they adjusted her. I think it's great that they want to give girls someone to look up to in this day and age. Between that and handing off the sheriff badge. I found this heartwarming and well accepted.

2) I liked the way they addressed Forky's coming to terms with being a toy. I think the nice 5 mile walk was just what they needed. It's awesome that Disney, in an easy way, introduced the concept of suicide/not belonging to a child audience and resolved it. Yes they played it off as silly and shouldn't have been so light hearted on the concept, but in the end it's a kid's movie and you really can't expect them to stray too far from that (at least forky coming to grips with his newfound livelyhood) without taking away the target audience. That being said hugely missed opportunity at the end, I think they should've had the knife also try to jump in the trash, and forky trying to teach them.

3) At no point was I not engaged during the movie. Every part had reason and interest. The sad parts were sad, silly parts were silly, and sweet was sweet. I'm VERY glad Woody and Bo did not kiss at the end, I think that would've ruined it, the romance was welcome but not necessary. I felt like they wanted to make Duke Kaboom a jelousy interest for Woody, but it got scrapped part way through. 

4) This is my biggest issue with the movie, and it is a big one. I BASICALLY WATCHED THE 3RD MOVIE AGAIN. Let me first begin with out of the first 3 the 3rd was my least favorite so yes I'm biased. But if you did not see Benson=Big Baby, Antique store security= daycare security, Arcade machine=hidden place where toys hang out in TS3, Voice box=switching buzz to spanish, duke kaboom=Ken 2.0 did you even watch either film? Also, just like TS3 it felt very ""If you excluded the last 10 minutes of the film, you could've told me this was all filler arc and I'd believe you""

5) Plot holes: they are expected sure, but come on. When Woody's voice box was being ripped out after tugging on him, they showed no damage to him. Several times woody's string was pulled without any voicelines. Woody showed no care for Harmony. Don't get me wrong he had his own kid to get back to, but he could care less if she cried when she couldn't find him. Any story between Gabby Gabby and Bo Peep was slept on. The whole knowing when to be alive vs still thing has gone on through out the movies, but it was very apparent in this one. You're telling me the mom didn't here buzz say Bonnie forgot her backpack? Dolly lost all sense of leadership as soon as they got on the RV. You're telling me Bonnie, a child who grew up hanging out with children she just met at daycare, had trouble making friends with randoms?

6) Buzz over the course of the movies has been reduced to nothing. He's such an icon to the franchise and yet over all these years, he has no understanding of how his conscience works? Heck i didn't even care for him in TS3.

I dunno I had a lot of gripes with this one, but still a very enjoyable movie nonetheless. GabbyGabby being tossed aside caught me off guard. Humor in the film was well paced. Between ducky and bunny, duke kaboom, and the RV antics it made for a well rounded film. Super well detailed. Forky had rosy cheeks, you could even see the minor nicks in woody's hat, and tell Bo was porcelain. The title scene, themes, symbols, and character development was phenomenal. Most important of all they really hit their target audience; children and adults reliving the nostalgia of music and beloved characters from the first two movies.  This all being said good luck making a TS5. Every trope they played on character separation they put into Bo. If they do that with Woody reuniting with the gang I will be very upset. It's going to be difficult to find good reasoning for all of it",c2ntqo
esgpv18,Gabby Gabby got off remarkably easy even though she tried *ripping Woody's organ through his back*,c2ntqo
essx41n,"I like the movie but it repeats a LOT of story beats from TS3:

&#x200B;

Both movies start with the fact that Woody hasn't been played with for an long time, something Woody can't accept. Therefore Woody comes up with a plan to get played with again but it backfires immensely.

Next all the toys go on a trip when Woody gets separated from the gang.

After a while woody ends up in a place that seems really cool in the beginning but is secretly ruled by another toy that seems friendly at first but turns out to be evil.  That toy is hurt because it hasn't been played with for a long time and he/she takes it out on Woody.  

Along the way a ton of toys are introduced. Somehow Toy Story 3 manages to manage this better by not putting most of the original cast on the back burner.

The evil toy boss (Gabby/Lotso) captures at least one of the toys while Woody manages to escape. Woody then needs to devise a plan to rescue the captured toy(s) with the help of some of the new toys he met. He successfully rescues the toy and meets up with the rest of the gang. At the end Woody and the toys need to make a choice that affects how their life will change from then on.",c2ntqo
etjd7xx,"Not sure I like the ending, but I did enjoy myself and liked the humorous bits and the animation quality.

Also I liked that he gave his voice box to Gabby to have a life with a kid.

But Woody was praised for his loyalty to his kid but abandons Bonnie, and Buzz and the gang of friends he‚Äôs known FOR EVER for Bo Peep who he‚Äôs known for far less...

Bros before hoes Woody?

I just don‚Äôt like how it ended.",c2ntqo
eujeltx,Why is no one talking about the fact that we finally see Andy's dad in the film?,c2ntqo
eskqfgf,"I enjoyed the movie for the most part, but I couldn't help but feel it was just a cash-grab based in nostalgia. Toy Story 3 summed the narrative up so amazingly; we didn't need another installment in the franchise. 

In short: it was a cute, if not totally unnecessary, movie.",c2ntqo
et4rxt4,"I really don't understand how people are enjoying this movie so much. As someone who has seen all the Toy Story movies multiple times as it has defined my childhood, this film just doesn't make sense and it is poorly made compared to the other ones.

1. Bo Peep has been gone for way too long for me to even care about the romantic ending between her and Woody. It's nice they brought her back, but to hold on to a Toys romantic story arc for 25 years is near impossible for me. Especially after she's been gone for 20 of those years. 

2. They never show anything that happened between the time she was picked up to being a lost toy. Making her bad ass character haul unnecessary and completely disconnected from the original Bo Peep
3. Buzz Lightyear's character has been to reduced to have the IQ of a child. It's completely ridiculous that a character with complex thoughts and emotions had been diminished and sidelined like that.
4. Toy Story films are about the relationship between Woody, Buzz, and all the other characters but they were barely in the film. This film was written like a Woody and Bo Peep fan fiction.
5. Jessie barely had any screentime nor impactful dialogue for me to care about Woody giving her the badge at the end. If there was more dialogue between Woody and Jessie about being Bonnie's favorite toy then maybe it would have worked. 
6. The movie was advertised to be about an existential crisis or finding the purpose to life but it was played off as a joke within the first 30 minutes
7. The movie turned into a rescue film for a character who was barely even developed
8. Gabby Gabby ripped the voice box out of Woody while unconscious and Woody suddenly wants to help her??? What was the point of that whole conflict then???
9. Duke Caboom feels like Ken Doll #2 
10. It felt extremely awkward and depressing seeing OG characters have no dialogue and just stand there
11. You can just feel this movie lacks the care, effort, and charm that was put into 1,2, and 3",c2ntqo

errg865,"It was fine. I enjoyed it well enough, but I didn't love it... I'm fine with the movie being Woody's story and the other characters not getting as much screentime, but I didn't like how Buzz was turned into an idiot. The whole ""inner voice"" thing doesn't really make sense for an older, more experienced character, why would he have trouble grasping that concept? And of all the other characters in Bonnie's group, he should have gotten some attention and development considering his close relationship with Woody. Bo should have had better character development too, considering what a big role she played in the movie.

I really liked Duke Caboom, he was fun! And him being a reference to a real life classic toy is pretty cool. Really, I liked how this movie addressed the concept of defective and disappointing toys, and how they often go without love.

At first I didn't get why Woody was fine with leaving and living on his own, considering his views. But after thinking about it, I think I know what they were going for, they just could have done a better job of building up to it. There are a LOT of toys out in the world, with more being mass-produced every day. And the antique store owner states that no one buys the toys in her shop. So I think the intent is that Woody is accepting that his days as a toy are over. Really, what are the odds that he's going to find another kid who truly cares about him and won't tire of him as quickly as Bonnie did? But he can help toys that do have a chance. I think that's a good concept, but like I said, they should have built up to it a little better. When Woody acts a certain way for three movies and then you want to change him in movie four, ya gotta give him a stronger motivation.",c2ntqo

esn3yy9,"Just watched it. I still have 3 as my favorite, though I might prefer this over 1. Still on the fence regarding 2.

The scene when Gabby goes with the lost little girl at the end, was fucking amazing. Such genuine emotion, and you can see that's when Woody realized his newfound purpose. Show, don't tell at its finest.

Speaking of him, wonderful character arc for Woody. Bittersweet endings are *always* the best, and bittersweet this was.

This probably had the best humor in the series too, I laughed plenty of times. Pixar has their comedic timing on point lately, Incredibles 2 was also hilarious.

I had issue with Buzz though, what's up with him stupidly listening to his ""inner voice"" like that? And, this isn't really a complaint, but the scene where Buzz can't grasp the concept of a conscience. Huh... did the movie just imply that Woody has developed a conscience, unlike most toys...?

This is definitely the most mind-fuck-y of the series. What gives toys sentience? If a kid starts playing with a piece of cloth, does it become alive? How does Forky know he needs to not move when humans are watching? *I have so many questions*

This is a more mature movie than the rest, it's amazing how the writing keeps growing up with the audience.

I give it a rating of ""I'm such a Pixar fanboy"" out of 10",c2ntqo

eroxz9j,"There's a reason these movies are called Toy Story, not Andy Story. 

I was super cynical about this one, because 3 felt perfect with Andy leaving. But dealing with the aftermath of his leaving, closing Woody's arc, realizing that sometimes it's okay to prioritize self care over others, this just... This was the ending I didn't even know I needed. Just lovely. 

Toy Story might be the most consistently wonderful film series ever.",c2ntqo
es4irgn,"As someone who watched and adored all the previous movies, the way Bonnie treated Woody in this movie broke my heart, especially after her whole ""my cowboy"" stuff with Andy at the end of 3, him asking her to take extra special care of Woody in particular and the lengths Woody was willing to go in the movie just for her. I think most of us have been there before: being the most important person to someone but then brushed aside for someone else.

However, it was a really important part to Woody's character arc. From terrified at being a lost toy and owned by a not so nice kid in Sid, to understanding that there is more outside of a childs room and finally realising when it's time to say goodbye and moving on. The last point kind of ties in with both 3 and 4. I really hope Pixar don't do a 5th because everything felt neatly wrapped up at the end.

For me, Key and Peele absolutely stole every scene they were in and were the stars of the movie. Absolute comedy geniuses that had me in stitches with every appearance. The Gabby Gabby stuff was also great. I was hoping we'd hear one of Woody's toy lines fizzle out like hers did.

One thing that kinda took me out of it was the toys interacting with humans to direct the story. I guess after watching 1-3, I was so used to them trying to be subtle (except for Woody and Sid in 1).

ertyyft,"Honestly I loved this movie I think it's probably my 2nd favorite Toy Story at the moment. I went in with such low expectations and really knew absolutely nothing about the story because I honestly felt like this was gonna be a Cars 2/3 where they were making a sequel just for the heck of it. But the storyline was actually really good with this one, a lot of laughs and some solid emotional moments.

The new characters they added to this one were pretty great too, but I did miss the older characters not really being in much of the new storyline. I also wish adult Andy was in this somehow, but they did talk about him a lot.

I thought the plot of Woody giving up his voice box for Forky was sad but a good storyline. I'm surprised that they tried to help Gabby Gabby out after they did that to Woody, I'm glad she didn't end up with Bonnie's crew that would have been strange.

I feel like the ending for this movie was a little weird though. I never saw Woody leaving his crew behind and going to be a ""lost toy"", it just felt strange to me. Just doesn't feel right him leaving everyone to run off with Bo Peep. I felt like for Woody leaving the group the other characters didn't seem to upset, Jessie even hugs him goodbye cheerfully. Buzz's moment with him was touching and nice. 

Anyway I don't think this is the end of the franchise, even though the BO wasn't what Disney was expecting for this one I still think they'll make a TS5. I have a hard time imagining Disney bringing TS back after TS3 ended everything so beautifully just for them to make only 1 sequel and ending it. 

Marketing for the next TS needs to be much better IMO. The previews for this movie did them no favors and the backlash from this being a sequel to the neatly wrapped up TS3 movie didn't help either.",c2ntqo

Woody's story is a retread of his arc in TS2, only this time he makes the complete opposite decision that he made in that movie, which flies in the face of what Andy told Bonnie about Woody before handing him off to her (""he will never give up on you, no matter what"") and splitting him off from the rest of the toys that he's been with throughout the entire series was goddamn infuriating to me, not tearjerking.

Buzz also being written as an idiot who cannot grasp the idea of a conscience and has to push his own buttons for ideas is a retcon of how he used his brain to devise the plans to rescue Woody in TS2 and TS3. Who is this fucking moron, and what has he done to Buzz Lightyear?

I have so many other complaints, but those are the two big ones that I can be bothered to share. I don't think there's anything wrong with you if your emotional reaction to this movie was the one they were going for or if you like this movie in general, and I hope that everyone else who feels disappointed doesn't act like a gatekeeping asshole about it towards those who did like it, but I really cannot help but be bothered by how inconsistent the characters behave in this movie.",c2ntqo

Finally got to see the movie this weekend and I am pretty upset. So much of this movie did not work for me and I'm upset I didn't like it.

I hated how they made Buzz comic relief. Barely any of the OG gang got any screen time. 3 really showed you how much Bonnie loved Woody. More than any of the other toys Andy gave her. In this movie she doesn't care at all about him and doesn't even realize he's gone? That makes no sense to me. Plus, Woody's whole character is and always has been about being there for your kid. So his ending in 4 rubbed me the wrong way. I cried at the end of the movie because I was upset, not because it was a good ending. Leaving all the toys and especially Buzz just like that was upsetting. In 3, they make it a huge deal that all toys want is to be played with. So Woody just decides he doesn't care about that anymore? Why couldn't Bo just go back with the rest of the gang? The new characters aren't as memorable as others introduced in the other sequels like Jessie, Bullseye, Stinky Pete, Lotso, etc. The previews made Forky out to be one of the main, best, new toys and he was made by Bonnie, so he should have a bigger part but to me he seemed like a minor, side character.

3 is still the perfect end to the movies and this movie to me still doesn't seem nessesary. 

I'll have to watch all the movies together again to see if 4 gets any better, but after first viewing I really didn't like it and I really wish I did.

This was good. Maybe the best animation in a film I've ever seen (the carnival at night, the chandelier, Bo Peep's porcelain were all amazing to look at). Bo and Woody's characters were well developed, as were some of the new ones (Forky's a standout, and I'd do anything for that little spork). And I loved how this deepened the universe; the idea of ""lost toys"" hadn't been explored prior to this, but it makes the world feel bigger.

My biggest issue is that every other character from the original movies has little to no role, including Buzz. In each of the other three movies, Buzz has real arcs. So do Jesse, Rex, Slinky, and the Potato Heads. In 4, they are all one dimensional. None of them grow or change at all, and most of them hardly have any lines.

esk1dru,"This movie is new in location and scope but it's not thematically different from the previous two. In a world with sentient toys, they eventually all get lost or the kid grows up and gives them away or whatever. This movie is actually very much like Toy Story 3 in that its emotional payoffs are specifically about characters we've seen together from the beginning leaving. Last time it was Andy, now it's Woody. 

There are a lot of potential themes that are brought up throughout the movie, questions that are raised, but they're never explored or answered fully:

* What makes a toy a toy here? Why was Forky wrong to think he was more suited to be trash? 

* Is it wrong that toys are devoted to people at the risk of all toy-kind? 

* Is Woody being self-centered and delusional, and was Bo right to take him to task for it in the middle? 

* How far can these goddamn toys go in manipulating the universe before everyone catches on and realizes they're in a horror film where the toys are rising up to kill them? 

* How far back do toys remember? If Woody was made in the 50s, what was he doing before Andy was born? 

They introduce like ten more toys to put in happy meals every time a new movie comes out, and then they shelve basically all of the previous ones for most of the movie. I probably could have guessed that the way they were able to reuse old Don Rickles lines in this movie is that he's got like two lines and they're both something vague like ""Woody look out!"" 

Key and Peele were actually hilarious in this. It was a failure of advertising that they came off so bad in the trailer. Or maybe I'm just too old to be the target market for the marketing anymore. 

The Toy Story series is largely defined by the gaps between films. We had to wait four, then eleven, then nine years between each. The gulf between the type of movie Toy Stories 1 and 2 are and the type that 3 and 4 are is vast, largely because Andy held the first two together and without him there's a big existential crisis. 

To state the obvious, this is the end and we're not gonna get another one. Weirdly enough, this film made me want to see Inside Out 2. I feel like that one is going to have to expand its themes along with Riley's social development, and unlike Andy they literally can't abandon her.",c2ntqo

erqw679,"I think there's a lot to be said about this movie and the idea of mental health in general, with the toys as conduits for things like depression, anxiety, obsessive behavior, rejection, and how to deal with it. Still collecting my thoughts as to a thesis about it.

That said, I enjoyed the movie a lot more than I thought it would. The visuals were gorgeous and show how far we've come from TS1. Woody got his own Old Man Logan/Old Snake sendoff (without the gloom of the former) and Gabby Gabby was believable in her motivations, though her methods skewed.

The other toys did take a backseat (no pun intended) but did have things to do to keep the plot moving forward, even if it was just bouncing ideas around. 

My biggest fear with Bo was that she would be the antagonist, since we've had that same heel turn reveal in the previous two movies. But giving her a much more layered character than ""Woody's eye candy"" was great to see, and it was logical. 

It's hard to rate this movie having just seen it 30 minutes ago, but I would have it tied with the 2nd movie. Right now, it's more of a fluctuating list, but I think once the dust settles itll be remembered fondly as a movie that wasn't just a cash grab.",c2ntqo

Now it makes me feel there has to be a fifth film to end Buzz and the rest of the toys.

In terms of everything else, am I the only one here who feels that some of the original side characters like Jessie, Hamm, Rex, and Mr Potato head, had a less impact in this film? I feel compared to the last films, they had less involvement than this film. Not a big deal, but I would of loved to have seen more screen time with them in a big involvement, even going with Buzz to find Woody like Toy Story 2 feeling. Buzz's character felt weird in that film as well, his ""inner self"" having to rely on what his voicebox tells him.",c2ntqo

Toy Story 3 came out at such a perfect time for people in my age range: people who were kids for 1+2 and entering/being in/leaving college for 3. I don't think any version of 4 could have recaptured how I felt at that time in my life and how 3 spoke to those feelings. 

Still, I really like the ending, even if it was very tough to see Woody say goodbye to his friends. Toy Story 3 made me cry because leaving your childhood behind is tough; 4 made me tear up thinking about how sometimes, even if you love your family or your friends or a part of your life, you grow beyond it and need to move on. And that new city or job or relationship will be great for you, and you'll feel a new sense of purpose, but it's still hard to know that sometimes to grow, you have to move on from things that make you happy and safe. When I write it out it seems similar to 3's ending, but I don't know, it felt more personal and more about self-fulfillment here.

Anyway, the rest of the movie: I loved that the story kept changing and wasn't as simple as it seemed in the ads (from keeping Forky alive to saving him from Gabby to helping Gabby). The setting gave the story a lot of different ideas to explore. Forky and Duke Kaboom really cracked me up, I liked the Gabby was a more understandable and redeemable villain, and there were fun small characters like Giggles, the clock in Bonnie's closet, and the Combat Carls. I loved the creepy puppets, and overall the movie made me laugh a lot more than I expected. 

The misses: I think they're going to be very love or hate, but I did not like most of the Ducky/Bunny stuff. They felt very out of place in a Toy Story movie; their bits felt way more improv-y, and while some of them were funny, it just...didn't gel for me. Like the different plans all ending in them attacking the grandma--funny, but the imagine spots felt very out of place in this series. I felt the same way about Duke Kaboom imagining his kid's floating head. 

I wish the supporting cast from the other movies had been used more, though most of them got some good lines (Potato Head had almost none, though!). 

Overall, I really enjoyed it. I think it's gonna be more controversial online than 3 was, and people are gonna be bothered by some things, but I think this is a great addition to the franchise.",c2ntqo
erp2khq,Imo this would probably be ranked last out of the four. Totally throws 3‚Äôs near flawless ending  out the window and I don‚Äôt think after all gabby gabby has done to other toys she merited keeping woodys voice box not to mention how manipulative she was to woody. I also think it would have tied the movie to a better ending if bo peep took the chance with Bonnie while reuniting with the best friends she ever had. I might need a little more time to think about how I really feel about this movie because I‚Äôm honestly devastated that they would separate woody and buzz. Other than those two parts it was a great movie and the animation was breathtaking. I just wish Pixar could have made a few changes to the story that wouldn‚Äôt have left a deep sadness within me.,c2ntqo
erxil8f,"A bit disappointed with this one. I would've loved a stronger notion of Woody leaving the gang behind to help other toys - but very much felt like he left them just to be with Bo. The emotional impact of that just didn't land for me, having not been as connected to Bo as the rest of the gang. 

I also felt they dumbed down Buzz for no real reason - I get that it's Woody's story, but to have Buzz's decisions suddenly completely driven by his toy's programmed voice brings him almost back to TS1. When Woody went into the antiques the last time to save Forky, I believe there's no way Buzz would ever leave him behind. The entirety of TS2 had Buzz driven to help his best friend regardless of the circumstances, and this one felt it took a few steps backward. 

Finally - Gabby: the attempt at empathy toward the end fell flat for me. Her means of getting what she wanted were sadistic, and even if she offered the voicebox back, it doesn't take away the fact that her decisions of pursuing her want were horrific. The issue with her voicebox is the exact same as Wheezy yet the latter had a much more relatable and loveable approach.",c2ntqo
erp6for,This is a great film and worthy of the franchise but it doesn't come close to topping the potency of the requiem for one's own childhood that 3 gave.,c2ntqo
ertwdfy,"If you told me I would still be crying like a giant baby at Toy Story 4 and at 29 years old... 

Yeah I‚Äôd probably believe it. I‚Äôm amazed they pulled this off. This could have failed in so many ways and they fucking nailed it.

Edit: also finally glad they got away from the secret bad guy storyline. Turning it around and realizing Gabby as a tragic figure, having Woody willingly give up his voicebox for her,  and giving her a happy ending was a nice shift for the series.",c2ntqo
erxtibq,I might be in the minority hear but I thought the animation was phenomenal but everything else was just mediocre.,c2ntqo
erosrxp,"The scenes preceding and at the orientation day. Man. That got to me so hard. And it culminated in the creation of Forky... Wow.

Bonnie wanted a friend at kindergarten. From wanting that comfort of a friend from home, one of her toys, and being forced to leave it at home, to being ignored by the Apple Boy... That hit me so hard personally, as a former child who felt that way and as a father of a child who just finished kindergarten herself.

But Woody was there for her. He was like a parent. He saw her pain and fear and had to be there for her no matter what. The way he guided her hand and that she was able to grow and create something to cling to; that's the best a parent hope for. 

The thing she created, in it's material existence, is a nothing. Millions of Forkys are made by millions of children everywhere, and in reality are, literally, just trash. But that she was also able to imbue that trash with meaning and life is exemplary of us as humans. Whether that life is granted to a carnival prize, a toy found at the playground, an antique or a pile trash, only we can grant these qualities to the things we cherish. And it makes me not only notwant to lose that quality in myself, but to help instill it in my own ""Bonnie"".

I'm crying as I write this, and it's getting long, so I should wrap up, but I sincerely love this film. 

I might come back to this and expand on some of the many themes that are floating around in my head (Buzz, Bo, Harmony, etc), but for now I hope my ramblings got my point across.

TL;DR: WATCH THIS FILM AS SOON AS YOU CAN",c2ntqo
erq3q90,"I liked it but it definitely isn't the best Toy Story, that honor goes to 2. 

The climax is definitely the weakest of the 4 in comparison to the moving truck, runway, and garbage dump of the previous 3 which were all way more exciting.

I keep seeing people compare Gabby to Lotso, but I barely see any similarities. Lotso had a kid but Gabby doesn't. I actually think she may be the best villain in the tetraology.

The biggest downside is that you can tell that Tim Allen is old and Buzz seems more dim than in 1-3. That and giving the old characters nothing to do was a bit disheartening.

Right now I'd probably rank them 2>>3>4>1 based on how much I enjoyed them.",c2ntqo
ery7ddu,"Apparently three quarters of the script for this movie was re-written in 2018, a little over a year before it was supposed to come out. They lost the original writers in 2017 over creative differences, and Lasseter, one of the main creative voices behind the project and the series, was ousted from Disney/Pixar in the middle of production. Hell, they only finished recording the VO in January of this year. 

This actually makes a lot more sense, because the script certainly feels like a bunch of conflicting ideas. The final product has eight people listed as story developers, which is a far-cry from the 3 Toy Story 3 had (Lasseter, Unkrich and Stanton). 

I‚Äôm assuming that the original treatment that Lasseter, Stanton, Unkrich and Docter came up with was scrapped because of Lasseter‚Äôs controversies and the loss of the original writers in Rashida Jones and Will McCormack. It‚Äôs no wonder the movie feels like such a jumbled mess.",c2ntqo
es3l75o,"To prepare for this movie, I watched the first 3 in a row the day before, which may have colored my opinion a bit, but it also made the ending seem even more wrong. I was so disappointed in the ending, so much that it ruined the whole movie for me. I remember seeing the first two movies as a little kid and the third as I was starting to think about going off to college, which made it a perfect ending for me. The conflict in all of the movies has revolved around Woody staying with his friends (rescuing Buzz from Sid in the first movie, escaping Al and the museum in the second movie, then rescuing the toys from Sunnyside and giving up going to college with Andy in order to stay with his friends). That was what really bothered me - Woody didn't go to college with Andy so that he could stay with Buzz and the gang, and in this new movie, he gave that up to run off with Bo and a new posse of toys we've never even seen before (Key and Peele were funny, though). If they were going to be separated anyway, I would have much rather seen him go off with Andy.

&#x200B;

The other thing that bothered me (and the people I saw it with) was Gabby's ending. Right off the bat, she decided she was going to steal Woody's voicebox. She then kidnapped Forky and got him to tell her everything about Woody so she could use it to manipulate him. I disliked her as much as I disliked Lotso, maybe even more because her and her henchmen were creepy in a way that Lotso wasn't. THEN, Woody and Forky are finally back with Bonnie, and Woody decides to risk that \*again\* so he can bring Gabby to Bonnie. But then on the way there she decides she's just going to go with a lost crying girl that they see, and they presumably live happy ever after. So the main villain here, the creepy, evil doll, gets a happy ending while my childhood is ruined by Buzz and Woody getting torn apart? I would have rather seen her tied to the front of a garbage truck.",c2ntqo
esegtrl,"Okay in Hindsight it's pretty obvious where the rewrites where.

 The strongest part of the film is Woody and Bo's story. We know it started out as a romance between the two so that would have been there from the beginning. Then Forky is pretty important to the plot line so he would of been their earlier.

 The characters that stick out like a sore thumb though is the original cast who do nothing the whole movie. At a guess we were never meant to see them again till the very end with the focus only on Woddy and Bo.

 Buzz's storyline seems mostly out if character. Only at the very end did he feel like normal Buzz. And Bunny and Ducky also felt out of place the whole movie. They just didn't fit in. They don't add anything to the narrative at all, if they weren't their the plot wouldn't have changed.

 As well as that the climax of the movie ignores their motivations. Buzz's plotline has no resolution and Bunny and Ducky all of a suddenly decide not to go with Bonnie despite the fact that was the deal at the start. So clearly they weren't meant to factor in.

 At a guess Disney demanded more Buzz and that's where those characters came from. The ending was left unchanged so now their plot lines stick out like a sore thumb.",c2ntqo

My only complaint is that all of the old characters didn‚Äôt really get much to do, but the new characters were great.

But there was some things I didn't enjoy


1: Buzz being super not himself was really off putting, ""what's a conscious?"" Like what? Why is he dumb now? I found him to be a smart character and he got reduced to that.


2: Wooden having his voice box almost pulled out during the tug of war with buzz and Gabby Gabby, his voice box is clearly almost pulled out but then when he heads back inside his back is fine? What?

3: Bonnie's mom really didn't notice buzz activating his own buttons? Like she's looking at his back and he's still pressing away?? No one found that buzz SPOKE normally Strange? He straight up said you left your backpack at the antique store.

4: all of the other Characters not really doing much, they were kinda just...there.
it felt more of a woody solo movie than anything else.

5: bunny and ducky didn't really add much other than the antique store joke (the third buildup was fantastic) but other than that they were just comedic relief and I found them kinda annoying",c2ntqo

erswzds,"It's crazy to think how sceptical I was heading into this. No animated series in history has come close to replicating what this series has done over the course of nearly 25 years.  Toy Story 4 reminded me of the Pixar that I love. The Pixar that are able to make me classics after all these years. Coco was great but this is excellent. The new characters are resounding successes. Key and Peele have the funniest moment in the entire series. Keanu Reeves is Keanu Reeves and it's glorious. Tony Hale once again turns an absurd character into a brilliant character.

Woody and Bo's story will make you cry, smile and leap for joy. Tom Hanks and Annie Potts deserve all the praise in the world for delivering some of the work of their career.  My only negative is that the old guard don't get to pass the torch to the new guard which would have been nice. Buzz is also a moron but this isn't his movie. This is Toy Story and that toy is Woody. Pixar you've done it again.

My opinion:

I loved it. Skeptical at first, because Toy Story 3 ended it so well, but this was amazing. Everything about it was amazing: the characters, the visuals, the acting, the humour and most importantly, the emotion. I tend to hide my emotions in fear that I will get picked on for being different, so when I do cry, I let out so many tears. And the ending to Toy Story 4 reduced me to a blubbering, crying mess that didn't stop being in tears until half an hour after the film had finished. Hats off to you, Pixar. You're the gift that keeps on giving.",c2ntqo
erwqdxu,"KEANU SAID *woah* AT THE END OF THE MOVIE AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE THEATER THAT GOT THE REFERENCE I AM SO DAMN OLD.

But anyway, I enjoyed the movie. It was pretty slow in some parts but Key and Peele were fucking hysterical and the running gag of ‚Äúdad‚Äôs going to jail‚Äù had me rolling. The writing was on the wall for Woody tho you could see it coming from a mile away. Someone else commented what I was thinking, Woody is going to go through the same stuff again if Bonnie rejects him. It was a fitting end for him but man I wasn‚Äôt prepared for him to be saying goodbye to Buzz and the gang. 25 years of Toy Story possibly coming to a close and I couldn‚Äôt be happier.",c2ntqo
es2pqnb,"Toy Story's always been about the conflict between Woody and Buzz for me. Something always pits the two against each other although they become best friends up to this point. 

The first one featured the two directly at odds and when it came to drama, a lot of it came from the fact that their relationship was constantly being misunderstood by the other toys still with Andy. Setups and pay offs are literally perfect and its existentialist themes make it a classic which has aged extremely well.

The second one takes the next logical step and forces the other toys on a rescue mission. Some of them participate to go rescue Woody but BnL most conflict comes from Woody trying to find his purpose.

By the third, Woody is purely loyal again putting him against not only Buzz but against all the other toys. They face the possibility of death together and get over these issues. I love how this one drags all the remaining toys into the conflict as well and this is probably the best utilization of all of the characters (each of the classic ones gets a moment to shine and yet still featuring new ones). 

So while I love the fourth one, I think this is the biggest part missing. Conflict within the group of our old familiars. Instead, this film is solely about Woody and while the ending was a bit of a tearjerker, there was never really a doubt that Woody would stay with Bo for me (that and Bonnie completely forgets who Woody is and loses the one toy Andy told her to take care of). I enjoyed the ride and its gags but it felt wholly unnecessary and I honesty would not have minded if they relegated this to a television special. 

I love these films. I am as old as they are and Toy Story is in my top 10 list of greatest films of all time. They mean a lot to me and I'm not trying to be a hater but when the characters are misrepresented, I think people generally notice when the authenticity is missing.",c2ntqo

This really should be called ""Woody's Story"" because I feel like the plot is centrally around him opposed to the other cast of toys who kind of fall into the background and don't feel as fleshed out as Woody or Bo; even Buzz feels not as important. Even still, the movie introduces a bunch of new and old characters and at a certain point it felt like maybe there was too many toys to keep up with? but that could just be me. 

The animation is incredible, some of the scenes looks photorealistic and when you look back at the animation of Toy Story 1 you can see how far we've come. It's amazing.

Was this movie necessary ? Probably not. Toy story 3 felt like such a perfect ending, but it's fun to go back into this world and to give Woody his own finale in a franchise that I grew up with. I saw more adults in the audience than kids and the movie felt like it was definitely geared more for us, opposed to just children (especially with a new character named Forkie who literally tries to keep offing himself...), so that was cool.

Definitely a worthy addition to the Toy Story Franchise. Now the question is... will they make another one?",c2ntqo
es4iran,"When I heard the bear and bird toys I was thinking ""Is that Key and Peele?"". As I continued watching it, I was convinced it was Key and Peele but I wasn't 100% sure. I had a strong feeling it was some comedy duo though. Once I saw the credits roll, I was very happy it was them because they were hilarious.

&#x200B;

I enjoyed this movie because of the story between Woody and Bo, as they set up the plot in the opening scene. You could see that Woody wasn't going to turn his back on Bo for a second time and it was great to see his friends so supportive of him staying with her. It was a really emotional movie and I feel probably is the end of the series but who knows!

That aside, this wasn't a bad movie. The comedic moments made me laugh and the sad scenes got me crying. That means the opening song with Andy, like 2 Gaby Gaby scenes and of course the final farewell.

erpcbu8,"A lot of you may not agree with me, but this movie feels out of place with the entire Toy Story-verse, including the shorts (Toy Story Toons, Toy Story of Terror, & Toy Story That Time forgot). Let me tell you why I feel this way.

There are a lot of plot points that don't make sense but there's one in particular that really irked me. By the end of Toy Story 3, we were shown that **Bonnie loves Woody** almost if not the same as Andy's love for him. It was also shown in the shorts after the events of the 3rd movie that Woody is still Bonnie's **favorite toy**. The events of 4 picked up just a few months after 3, so why the heck does Bonnie not want play with Woody all of a sudden? It's because the writers wanted to push the idea that Woody was starting to feel *useless*, and thus coming up with that ending. They had to take shortcuts to come up with that **surprise** ending. But after showing us 3.5 movies of Woody being loyal to his friends and kids, that ending was very unlikely of him.

The film also lacked **spectacle**. This first movie had Woody and Buzz work their way out of Sid's house and chase the freaking truck. That was amazing. The second one had them in an airport then an airplane. Super insane situation for them. Then the 3rd gave us the tear-jerking incinerator scene. The fourth one looked promising because of the carnival but they didn't actually do anything with it. We don't see them do something we've never seen them do before. It felt small for a film of this magnitude. 

The film has its moments but don't actually work as a whole and falls way short of the standards that 1,2,&3 put up. I grew up with these characters, so I came into the cinema with an open mind, eager to see what Pixar has in store for us‚Äî but they didn't have anything new.",c2ntqo
es5qbln,"What was Bo‚Äôs character arc supposed to be? It seemed like there were moments hinting she secretly missed belonging to a child, but this was never revisited. Also, she was VERY unfair and mean to Woody, especially in the antique store and when they met with Duke Kaboom for the first time. She lays into him for botching the first Forky rescue - uhh, honey, this is the same guy that‚Äôs saved how many toys‚Äô asses over four fucking movies? Show some respect and trust for the supposed love of your life. Woody didn‚Äôt deserve it and she never really apologized. 

Look, as a lady myself, I‚Äôm all here for empowering, layered female characters. But I feel like Bo‚Äôs newfound badassery turned her into, dare I say, a one-track beyotch. She never had a moment of introspection that would have been the true measure of a 3D character.",c2ntqo
erqlg5p,"I really really didn‚Äôt like this film. I grew up obsessed with toy story and after the Toy Story 3 I thought they‚Äôd achieved a near perfect trilogy with a perfect ending. The toys go to another kid and live out their days with her, we don‚Äôt know where they go beyond that but we don‚Äôt need to. I‚Äôve never sat and watched a film that felt so...unnecessary?

My biggest gripe was buzz being completely sidelined, ESPECIALLY when him and woody said goodbye to one another. Why didn‚Äôt that feel like a huge moment?! They hugged and said goodbye in like 30 seconds. They‚Äôre partners!! They‚Äôre best friends in the whole world?!

Some of it was funny. Woodie leaving at the end was stupid why would woodie leave his friends and woodie is always faithful to his owner no matter what. John lasseter didnt direct this film so that was a big ouch to a lot of it. Hopefully we might get a toy story 5 and woodie returns.

f72ti88,"I thought it was pleasant enough but kind of a mess.

It still feels unwarranted to me. There was nothing about the film that was good enough to feel like it was a story that needed to be told. I think that stems from a lot of it essentially being recycled plot points from the first three movies--I was constantly going like ""oh that's just like in 2!"" or ""wait didn't this happen in 3?"" 

That didn't work for me because what made the first three so great was how original and clever they were. So while this one wasn't bad per se, it lacked that grounbreaking charm that the first three had.

And I feel like this one opened a can of worms it didn't really want to open. Maybe it was just because I was younger idk but for the first three I don't remember ever really questioning the premise of toys being alive...this one seemed to be screaming questions about that the entire time. Which is fine with me but I wish if they were going to open that can of worms that they would commit to really opening it and exploring those questions in a crazy way. I would've much rather sat through a Toy Story 4 that showed how toys first started being sentient, or showed toys having to break the illusion and confess to a human to get their help, or showed them a thousand years in the future having outsurvived humans. There are just so many interesting ideas that could be explored in this universe that I'm disappointed all we got was a by-the-numbers rehash of the first three movies.",c2ntqo
eroputi,"I really don‚Äôt think this was on par with the trilogy, maybe early reviews raised my expectations too much. the plot was so repetitive, the previous ones were clearer, ‚Äòget back home‚Äô, ‚Äòget woody‚Äô, ‚Äòescape‚Äô, this one felt messy. 

I know this was Woody‚Äôs movie but Buzz & co reaaaallly got benched hard so much so that while I did cry at the goodbye it was because of the weight of the previous movies and not what was presented in this. 

Gabby Gabby pales in comparison to Lotso and her whole arc wasn‚Äôt all that imo, I got it but it didn‚Äôt click with me. Sporky got real annoying real quick at the begging with that whole running to the trash gag that lasted a good 20 minutes, thankfully he redeemed himself. I enjoyed this new Bo a lot.

I loved the theme and the exploration of it, especially Woody not wanting to let go, I thought that was fantastic, just the plot it was framed around felt kinda meh.

errccs6,"It was really good and a lot of fun. Two things stuck to me that I didn't like though. First being the ending. I know the movie was all about being a free ""lost"" toy vs having a kid, but Woody leaving Bonnie and all of his friends just for Bo didn't seem right to me, even if Bonnie didn't care as much for him as Andy did. Second was that Buzz was sort of underutilized. The movies were always Woody and Buzz at the forefront and this one was all Woody with some  Buzz.

Still very good, but just wish that maybe Woody *and* Buzz went on this adventure together and that Woody, Bo Peep, and the other new toys went back with Bonnie instead.

Some things I liked: This was probably my favorite story out of the four movies. I loved the carnival and the antiques shop. The new characters were great. Duke Kaboom (Keanu) especially and Key and Peele as conjoined stuffed bears were perfect. And basically getting Buster Bluth as a toy was amazing in Forky. Woody and Buzz's inner voice talk was great too.",c2ntqo

Some part of me is screaming ""Woody, go back to Buzz and Jessie, take Bo with you"" but at the same time from a more logical standpoint, I understand his decision.  I'm remembering being little and seeing Toy Story 3 in theaters.  It's wild to me that some people who were kids when they saw Toy Story took their kids to the theater to see this one.  I remember relating to Bonnie and to Andy and most of all, wanting someone to care about me like Woody cared about them.  I loved it, but that ending SHOCKED me.  I feel like my childhood is just... over.  This movie brought back way too many memories.",c2ntqo

erur0ay,"I have really mixed feelings about this movie. It was a good film, very funny and had some truly emotional moments but I really felt like Toy Story 3 was a much better end to the series.

The premise of Woody's story about being neglected here kinda flies in the face of Andy specifically handed Woody over to Bonnie and asking her to take good care of him in 3. Would there be any reaction from Bonnie knowing that Woody has now gone missing, didn't seem to indicate so in the credits? I know she's only a kid, but it seems a bit inconsistent to me.

I didn't think Bo Peep was a significant enough character or significant enough part of Woody's character in previous films that it warranted a movie where the OG gang of Toys split up for Woody to be with her. Was Toy Story really in dire need of a love story?

I did tear up a bit when Buzz and Woody said there final goodbye though.",c2ntqo

err3vpr,"The Toy Story movies have always had a special place in my heart. I grew up with them from the very beginning as a kid and they've always been movies I re-watched plenty of times. Being very satisfied with how Toy Story 3 concluded everything, I was a little reluctant on wondering how they could pull off another Toy Story movie without it feeling pointless. Needless to say, Toy Story 4 sort of works I guess? It's not boring and still entertaining, but I don't know by the end of it I just sort of felt a little underwhelmed I guess? It's nice for Toy Story 4 to bring back old characters like Bo Peep and change things up a little following the new toy owner Bonnie instead of Andy, but I don't know I just didn't find the final result as satisfying to watch as the first three movies for some reason.

That's not to say Toy Story 4 is a complete waste of time or is bad. Definitely not at all. It focuses almost entirely on Woody and the other characters, including Buzz Lightyear himself, are mostly placed in the back-burner in favour of Bo Peep and the other new characters such as Forky, Ducky, Gabby Gabby, Bunny, and Duke Caboom. One thing that I seemed to notice in Toy Story 4 was that it definitely wasn't nearly as funny as the first three movies. Forky gets a few good moments, as well as Ducky and Bunny mostly being there for Comic Relief more than anything else, but surprisingly from Woody and the main gang? It definitely felt more lacking to me personally. The theme of toys deciding what to do with their own lives and not sticking to normality is certainly one of the more interesting elements of the movie, but the execution of how these events play out to me felt a bit messy in places and there were some contrivances and out of character moments throughout the movie that bugged me.

Nevertheless, whether the movie decides to focus on Forky or Bo Peep, things start to get a bit chaotic with how the plot is structured and there didn't feel like there was really any stakes to the story at all. The ""Toy Rules"" are really loose here and it takes alot of suspension of disbelief to see toys running around a carnival with no people caring about it at all. The antagonists themselves have good character moments and Duke Kaboom is probably the best new character in Toy Story 4. Bonnie herself is a bit of a bland toy owner compared to Andy, but thankfully she doesn't get too much time just spent on her alone. There are decent emotional parts throughout the movie that worked and I mostly like how it all concludes, but it makes me question if Pixar are going to be milking more Toy Story movies by this point. The animation is top notch as usual, as well as the voice acting from the main cast and all the new characters too.

Overall, Toy Story 4 is good and not the worst outcome by a long shot, but I didn't think it was amazing either. Honestly, I don't think there's anywhere else for these movies to go by this point. Just leave the series on a positive note and in case you were disappointed or underwhelmed by Toy Story 4, you could always pretend Toy Story 3 is the real conclusion to the series and consider this an epilogue. 6.5/10",c2ntqo

errm3z4,"Some people I think are really hung up on just the Bo Peep aspect of Woody staying at the carnival. Even leaving out the love interest aspect, from his perspective, Woody is coming to terms with being complete obsolete/ not being needed at all in his current environment. His home options are essentially limited to hoping he gets traded or sold to a kid who would play with him (which would likely take Woody away from his friends anyway and becomes increasingly unlikely as time and toy sophistication advances),  extended stays in that depressing closet  for years on end or the dreaded storage box/trash can (which is basically a toy's coffin). 

Woody knows his best years with Andy have completely passed. His capacity for that kind of emotional investment have drained from his past adventures. Now, his best life is to take it easy at the carnival, where the chances he is played with frequently increase exponentially, given how many kids always pass through.  

If I'm not mistaken, the film occurs months after Andy leaves for college, so it isn't like Pixar could've pulled something like Andy's kid winning Woody from a game or finding him and taking him home  to bring things full circle (even then, no guarantee he plays with Woody much and I bet people would bitch about that being corny).",c2ntqo

2. Buzz Lightyear's character has been to reduced to have the IQ of a child

3. Toy Story is about the relationship between Woody, Buzz, and all the other characters but they were barely in the film. It Feels awkward seeing OG characters have no dialogue and just stand there

4. Jessie barely had any screentime nor impactful dialogue for me to care about Woody giving her the badge

5. The movie was advertised to be about an existential crisis or finding the purpose to life, but was played off within 30 min as a joke

6. The movie turned into a rescue film for a character who was barely even developed

7. Gabby Gabby ripped the voice box out of Woody while unconscious and Woody suddenly wants to help her??? What was the point of that whole conflict then???

Some positives: Duke Kaboom was awesome! His final stunt was epic to watch. Also loved what they did with Gabby Gabby. The animation was gorgeous, especially at the carnival. Easily the best entry in the franchise when it comes to animation. The ending was perfect and I can't imagine it being any better.

The movie was great. It was a nice ending. I would rate in 2>4>1>3 (Toy Story Franchise). I just love the plot, like >!where Gabbi had a nice ending, but i kinda feel sad about Vincent and the gang!<

I almost cried on the first 15 minutes, and everything else is mixed up. I laugh hard especially on Buzz-Key-Peele scenes.

As a kid, I watched Toy Story and just saw the cute adventures the toys had and then recreated them at home. As an adult, I see now they‚Äôre all miniature parents whose sole purpose is to make sure every child has something to love, and they accept the inevitability that their child they ‚Äúhelped raise‚Äù is going to grow up without them. (Good lord, is that what parenthood is in a nutshell?)",c2ntqo
ery0ct7,"I've been seeing a lot about how the toys were parent figures to the kids, which really resonated with me in the theatre. Gabby Gabby was a sympathetic villain to me because she talked about how all she wanted was a kid, envied Woody for having Andy, and talked about how she was ""made with broken parts"" (or something to that affect). I interpreted that as an adult who was infertile or faced other issues conceiving a child. Did any one else get that vibe?",c2ntqo
es2llti,As soon as Forky came to life all i could think about were other kids that made their own toys and how it all works. I pictured a little kid in a village somewhere making a stick figure.

I know these are questions that aren't meant to be answered but it does make me curious.,c2ntqo

eroyf1t,"In many ways while 3 might have seemed as the perfect conclusion to the franchise , Bo Peep's return here justified a fourth film imo . Not only did her character evolve but she also showed a new dimension of what being a toy is to Woody that played a huge part in the beautiful ending of this movie . 

I think Woody while still loved Bonnie and always looked out for her realized through Bo Peep that he doesn't really want to keep this life of being a toy to be played with and then being grown out of when the owner matures . 

Also throughout the movie Bonnie herself was losing interest in Woody and that loss of interest only heightened after Forky made his appearance . This coupled with Bo Peep's inclusion and giving his toy box to a toy who could actually make good use of it to another kid really made Woody's arc and that conclusion wonderful .

I didn't think Toy Story 3's ending could be topped in terms of the emotional weight but when Buzz said ""Bonnie will be fine "" , I felt like my heart got ripped out and torn to shreds . Coupled with the ""too infinity and beyond"" quotes by Buzz and Woody as the movie ends was truly spectacular . 

This is the best movie of the series imo , which isn't saying much since you could argue the same for the other 3 masterpieces , but the emotional weight of this movie and the wonderfully unexpected conclusion really gave the toys and Woody the send off the series truly deserves .",c2ntqo

I understand what they meant by saying this felt more like a finale than 3, not because 3's trash compactor scene isn't iconic and well done as well as the scene where Andy gives the toys to Molly, but because this movie seems to do all it can to prevent us from getting another sequel almost knowing this one was kind of stretching it as is.

My kids were obviously bored, and they love the other movies. The youngest straight up said she didn't enjoy it, my eldest said she did enjoy it but she couldn't stop fidgeting to an extent I've never seen in a theatre.

The majority of characters were completely sidelined, even Buzz felt redundant - like they gave him screentime just to fulfil Tim Allen's contract. The new characters were spread so thinly that it was hard to warm to all of them. I felt like Gabby and Giggle could have offered so much more.

I'm still finding it hard to work out what I watched. I don't have the warm fuzzies I'd expect from watching Toy Story film. It's weird, it's like someone has bought the franchise, formed a committee on what should be in a new movie and then made it, but there's some kind of x factor missing.

The animation, however, was flawlessly executed. There were several points in the movie where I genuinely thought I was watching something filmed live.",c2ntqo
erp6blm,"I think must be the only scrooge who thought this movie was irrelevant and comparatively poorly written. The ending was such a disappointment. Woody left behind friends from 20+ years and it just wasn't as emotional as I hoped. Also, I missed the complexity of the plotting that the previous three films had. It seems like all the scenes that really excited me in the trailers were taken out of context, or never really fleshed out. 

&#x200B;

The characters who were very important in the other three lost depth. Buzz was reduced to a comic relief (not to say he wasn't funny; he was hilarious) and he honestly had very little input in the overall plot. Bonnie's character was amazing but it didn't make sense that she stopped loving Woody; it was waaaay too convenient. She was little more than a plot tool. The only characters that showed any significant growth were Woody and Forky. Bo had already changed prior to this, and she felt like she ticked off all the feminist boxes far too obviously. To me Woody's growth seemed off-character. Actually they were ALL off-character. The dialogue wasn't quite right.

&#x200B;

I adored the new characters, but most of them didn't have a significant input. It would have been interesting to see a film about a new set of characters because the older characters' storyline closed so well in Toy Story 3. Considering that this movie was almost entirely re-written part way through production, we've got this haphazard storyline that straddles the original rom-com and the newer emotional rollercoaster, but without balance. It's kind of like how you could tell Brave was re-written part way through. It's not quite cohesive.

&#x200B;

Can we really compare this to Toy Story 3? It felt more like Monster's University; a kind of pointless footnote (and a sure-fire way to make money). I know that's subjective. That's just my view.

Then, when she's abandoned, we're supposed to feel sorry for her? I didn't buy Gabby's emotional arc at all, and it's almost the crux of the final act of the movie.

&#x200B;

Also, the ultimate climax is completely undeserved. We spend 3 movies getting ultra-invested in these characters, only to have them separated in the last 5 minutes? It felt completely rushed and half-assed. If you think about it, in real time, Woody left the crew for what, a day? And then completely threw out 20 years of friendship within a span of 5 minutes. And the toys left in the RV? They are completely fine with letting their fearless leader of 20 years leave them after a 2 minute conversation? It's completely undeserved and lacks the emotional punch of all 3 of the previous movies.

&#x200B;

Overall, Toy Story 4 is a great film for the first 2 acts. If you turn it off after Bo, Duke and the other antique toys leave Woody in the alley, you'll be fine. Just make up an ending yourself, because anything would be better than the load of garbage that is this finale.

ervw8y6,"I did not like this movie at all.  It's visually stunning, but I had many problems with the plot:

* The ending dismisses the ending of Toy Story 3.  Andy has Bonnie promise to take care of Woody.  She doesn't.  Instead she forgets him and prefers playing with a spork.
* None of the character's made any sense, especially Buzz.  All his growth is thrown away when Woody tells him about his inner voice.
* The new characters did not add anything to the plot, as they have in the previous movies.  And the old gang did not play much a role.
* Why couldn't Bonnie's favorite toy still be Woody?  Why did Pixar make Jessie her favorite toy?  It was refreshing to see a young girl play with a ""boy's"" toy in Toy Story 3.
* No kid's favorite toy would be one they made for a year (Forky was made in Kindergarten and still lasted until 1st grade).  Maybe a couple days tops.
* The Toy Story movies have been about friendship, which has been refreshing since most of the animated Disney movies prior were about falling in love and having happy endings.  When Woody decided to go back to Bo, it totally took what Toy Story and Pixar had given us (really refreshing buddy movies) and threw it in the trash.

I wonder how much of the story is originally John Lasseter's and how much of it was due to the fact he exited the company in the middle of production.

ersslml,"Not my Toy Story.

I watched the movie last night and although I was entertained, the movie was thoroughly disappointing.

Where to even begin...

1. Woody was never shown to have leadership issues in the shorts between 3 and 4.

2. Why would Woody not want any help from Buzz and the other toys to keep Forky safe? I understand his whole  internal conflict and wanting to serve a purpose and fulfilment, but he has always been about serving his kid first and that's been a core trait of the character since the later half of Toy Story 1.

3. Which leads us to the disappointing use of the other toys. You have all these great characters and you undertilize them. It's like they had no idea what to do with them or the script was cut and made into the Woody show.

4. Buzz all of a sudden has amnesia about conscience and he is boiled down to a dumb joke that gets old fast.

5. Bonnie, oh Bonnie. One of my biggest gripes. She brought her toys with her to the road trip but she only cared about Forky whenever he was missing. Ok, I can understand that since that was her favorite toy at the time, but what about Woody? Not a single acknowledgement that he was missing too? This undermines so much of 3 that it pisses me off. Initially, Andy didn't want to give Woody away in 3, when he finally did, he made it clear to Bonnie how special he was. I understand Bonnie might be a fickle kid, but in all the shorts between 3 and 4, Woody was special to Bonnie as well. They changed Bonnie's personality for this atrocity of a movie and to serve the story that they wanted to tell. At the same time, they gave a slap to Andy and the relationship with Woody. Andy gave Woody away only because he knew she would love him. I guess Andy is a horrible judge of character.

6. Is it me or does Bo Peep's face look different than in 1, 2, and beginning of 4? Also, her personality change is way too radical for my taste. She is almost a different character. I understand her changing, but, her new personality seems to be pushing an agenda that goes with the current times. I don't like it. I would think anyone living on her own for so long would be happy to reunite with lifelong friends. I understand she didn't want to belong to a kid anymore, but still. Plus, the reunion with Woody and then the other toys was not as epic nor as heartfelt as it should've been. Also, isn't she porcelain? How was she able to take off her previous dress? The new outfit is meh. Again, pushing an agenda. None of the other toys have changed outfits, but the porcelain lamp/figurine did? Give me a break. Again, they made her into a new character. I hope 5 reverts her into old Bo Peep and is about the toys (all of them) getting back together.

7. Gabby Gabby was not thoroughly evil but there should have been a bigger consequence for her wanting to steal and ultimaly getting Woody's talk box. There should at least have been a resolution to Woody's talk box getting fixed. Also, the hoove of Bo Peep's sheeps gettind fixed too. 

8. I didn't mind Ducky and Bunny as they served their purpose but was annoyed that they were going to go with Bonnie and then... they just didn't. What?

9. Also, Gabby Gabby going to some newly introduced kid... annoying and fluff, not needed, predictable as soon as they showed the kid. I liked Gabby Gabby's character at the end and wanted her to go with the other toys. Bonnie accepting her and boosting her own self assurance and Gabby Gabby being loved and needed by a kid would have given both character a nice conclusion in this movie. A better ending to the movie than the one we got. It felt all other toys were the actual trash and Forky was the one and only. Unrealistic. Would have loved to see Gabby Gabby interacting with the other toys in future features.

10. The good bye... so lame! Why is Jesse given the Sheriff's star? Should have been Buzz. He is the other natural leader, not Jesse. Jesse is a leader lile Bo, but not to the extent of Woody and Buzz. The good bye was not epic as it should've been. It was short and unemotional. The hug between Buzz and Woody was not enough. Compare this ending to 1's Woody and Buzz rushing to the moving truck with RC and then flying over the truck? 2's airplane scene? Or 3's incinerator scene? Really? Why couldn't the toys be reunited? I missed Bo Peep in 3. A big theme for Toy Story has always been getting everybody safely together. They robbed us of that in this movie. Andy gave Woody to Bonnie and in the creation of this movie undid everything that 3 did so well... Woody was not even with Bonnie for a year (maybe?). Andy would be upset to know Woody is lost, perhaps forever. Haha, ""he is not lost"" right? But he is. The way they made Bonnie in this movie though, she wont even care.

Bonus: Maybe I missed it, but who were all those toys in the antique store partying? Lost toys in the store? I guess Kaboom randomly left the antique store too. Guess he doesn't care for the store or those other toys. There is a big chance these guys will be separated, living in a carnival? Bo is porcelain so she might be broken. Woody is a rare collectible.

Shout out to the first scene of the movie with Woody rescuing RC (what ever happened to RC by the way?) the other toys actually helping, the monkey line, and Woody trying to rescue Bo. This is actually the true essence of Toy Story. Well, except Bo not coming back with Woody, that part was the bad set up to this movie.",c2ntqo

erowb9b,"I was able to attend a test screening for this movie back in November of 2018 (I haven‚Äôt seen it tonight/this weekend). The first 3 movies are interchangeably my favorite Pixar movies, as well as some of my favorite movies ever. 

That being said, I was incredibly bummed that I not only didn‚Äôt love Toy Story 4, but that I felt so indifferent towards it; I walked out still wondering why it was made.

I saw it incredibly early, so there‚Äôs a slim chance that what I didn‚Äôt like about it was removed/changed (I say ‚Äòslim‚Äô because this is an animated movie; making drastic story changes, I feel, are very uncommon because of the whole animation process). What I really didn‚Äôt like was the fact that, aside for Buzz, just about every side character we love & grew up with are sidelined; they don‚Äôt have much to do at all. This being the Woody Movie with some Buzz and hardly any Jessie, Rex, Slinky, etc. made the movie feel like a TV special to me. I understand this was intended to be Woody‚Äôs movie with its story & ending, but it really just didn‚Äôt work for me. 

The Bunny and Chick characters really didn‚Äôt work for me; I found them rather annoying, in fact. When I realized that Keegan Michael-Key and Jordan Peele voiced them, I was devastated that two of favorite comedic actors working right now were probably my least favorite part of a movie.

I‚Äôm glad everyone seems to be loving it, I think I‚Äôll probably see it again soon with a more open mind. A huge part of me, as of now, still wishes they kept the send-off of this series 9 years ago.",c2ntqo

I always hate it when a friendship or other relationship is tossed aside for the superior 'romance'.

My biggest problem was the story. Pixar is usually the gold standard in storytelling but this one was a mess. I know that ALL Pixar movies, including the great ones, go through heavy rewrites. But this is the first TS movie where I saw all the seams...

- Within a few minutes, Bo Peep goes from dedicated member of the team to completely acquiescing to a permanent separation. You're leaving your home and loved ones for a mystery owner who might be locking you behind glass forever? It‚Äôs clear they just wanted to get that plot point out of the way.   

- Gabby is the most muddled ‚Äúvillain"" since Mac from Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Ultimately, she was rewarded for lying, kidnapping and terrorist demands -- she wouldn't release Forky unless Woody gave her an internal organ. What the hell?!

- The toys REALLY strained credulity with their outdoor scenes. They must have spent half the movie moving around in crowded, well-lit areas. Once they were stepping on the RV pedals with Dad at the wheel, they broke their own plausibility rules.

- I love Key & Peele, but they were awkwardly forced into the main plot for comic relief, and the whole bit with the cabinet key was so damn lazy. It got a cheap laugh but that was clearly Pixar not wanting to come up with another tricky action scene.",c2ntqo

Woody has no way to know Bonnie won't need him.

Woody's entire character since 1995 has been that you are there for your owner, period. He always urged the gang to stay strong because we are ANDY'S TOYS, and when ANDY NEEDS US WE'LL BE THERE FOR HIM.

It just doesn't feel right that he's throwing away (for us, the audience) over 20 years of that because he hasn't been played with in a bit with Bonnie. 

Woody has no way of knowing Bonnie won't need him, she and Buzz was once her favorite toys. It's just so out of character for Woody to bail on his owner when even when the toys were jealous that he was Andy's favorite, he urged them to stay strong and be there for Andy.

I feel like Toy Story 4 fits in the ""Toy Story Special"" which they make annually more than in the whole franchise.

It's not bad, but it's just not a good ending. Toy Story 3 was soo good already (I actually cried my balls out for that wasteland scene).

Or maybe I just have high expectations...",c2ntqo
esegw9d,"(TOY STORY 4 SPOILERS) OKAY so, look I have MANY harsh thoughts over the new toy story movie but i'll start by saying the animation was flawless and beautiful - fantastic job. 

OKAY, firstly Woody's character and development: Throughout all toy story movies Woody was portrayed as a toy with  undying loyalty towards Andy (or whoever owns him). It's undeniable he values his kid as he evidently risks his life in order to save Forky - the new development within the toy story 4 movie. He does this to ensure Bonnie (his new owner) attends to a happy life full of memories of her favourite toy/creation - Forky (after he runs away). Clearly, his whole motivation of life is to make kids happy, and this has stuck by him for 10+ years of Andy owning him. BUT - toy story 4 reveals BO PEEP , who for some reason is now showcased as some bad-ass woman that lives an edgy life as a lost toy. Fine. HOWEVER, because of this sudden exposure, the movie encounters a climax of Woody rejecting Bo Peep's way of life, devoting his loyalty to Bonnie. Furthermore, after rescuing Forky they all return to Bonnie's RV (right before they leave the carnival) and Woody's hesitance -- TO GO WITH HIS FRIENDS HE HAS KNOWN FOR LONGER THAN BO -- is evident. This moment concludes Woody's decision to stay with Bo Peep - and to abandon his friends with Bonnie. Bye Buzz, Bye Jessie, bye everyone, ill never see you again. 

I MEAN, couldn't Bo peep have just gone with them?? What was the point of Woody saving Forky? -- to show he was loyal to his kid?-- who he was gonna ditch anyway?? 

Why bother investing in a movie that falsely displays character behaviours? TOY STORY 3'S ending was perfect! it recognised Woody's loss of Andy, it kept all the toys together, it ensured a life of happiness.

&#x200B;

Um also Andy's last words to Bonnie were ""take care of him (woody) for me will you"" after giving Bonnie woody. I know, she's a kid, but she insisted she'd play and take care of him. What will she do know once realising Woody's gone missing? feel guilty she lost Andy's prize possession that is an exclusive collector's item?",c2ntqo
erop4s4,"Toy story 1-3 are all in my top 10 movies of all time, and I laughed and cried more in 4 than any of them. Cried in the first 5 mi utes and in the last 5, laughed out loud upwards of 50 times throughout. 

Might be recency bias, but it genuinely might have been my favorite of the 4

Edit: side note, but did anyone else notice the girl who looked like she couldve been an older Boo (monsters inc) in Bonnie's kindergarten class?",c2ntqo
eropeuo,"I have to admit, I was completely and utterly cynical and apprehensive when I first heard about Toy Story 4. I thought the series ended perfectly with Toy Story 3. Then I saw the trailer, and some of my doubt faded. Any remaining doubt I had left going in to this movie earlier tonight was quickly tossed away because damn. This movie was wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I love the characters, both new and old. They nailed Forky's existential dread without overdoing it. Keanu Reeves was perfect as Duke Kaboom (as a Canadian, I loved all his Canadian-isms). Key and Peele were good as well. They weren't overused, and they got some of the biggest laughs. All of the character development seemed natural. As soon as I realized what direction they were taking Woody in, I felt the waterworks begin,  and by the end, I was full on ugly-sobbing as quietly as possible.

The animation. It's Pixar, need I say more? It's photorealistic and beautifully rendered.

All in all, it ended up surprising me, and exceeding my expectations greatly. Apparently it's director Josh Cooley's feature debut. What a stellar debut as a feature director. I'm not too sure how I would rank this with the other Toy Story films, but it was spectacular and I wish I had never been apprehensive about it because it is delightful.",c2ntqo
eropxur,"I cried twice. During the opening credits seeing Andy grow up, and when Gabby Gabby finds her kid. Those were really heartfelt moment. 

I liked that Gabby Gabby was a different villain than the other ones we got for the franchise. The plush rush scene is probably the highlight of the movie. I thought playing the joke three time would ruin it, but it really paid off. 

I don‚Äôt know why, but the ending (goodbye) did feel a little rushed. I would have liked for Woody to spent a little more time with saying goodbye to all the toys he has lived with for 20+ years. Also, kinda sad, but realistic that Bonnie kinda forgets about Woody.

loved in the beginning they showed what happened to Bo Peep and how it transitioned from Andy to Bonnie...I got a lil misty eyed there.

Bonnie's first day at Kindergarten got me a bit too, cause I was that kid who didn't exactly make friends the first day.

Forky always wanting to be trashed was kinda dark, all things considered, lol.

The first one dealt with Woody's insecurity as Andy's favorite.

The second one dealt with the possibility of not being needed anymore 

The third one was about being replaced and learning to let go.

This one was also about letting go but from the other perspective.  Woody wasnt letting go from a kid but from his responsibilities as a toy. He was retiring.

So for the third Toy Story movie in a row I feel like the series has closure and can finally be done.

A few moments really hit me in the gut like gabby finally getting her kid. Actually I think that moved me even more than Woody's goodbye.

Overall I think it was a really good movie, not as good as the past three but that's a humongous bar, and good enough with a story told well enough to justify its existence.",c2ntqo
errhksd,"Very fun movie. 

The stuffed animals were kinda funny, but they were a bit overbearing sometimes. Forky was a fun plot device.

I still like Bo Peep in her old dress more, but her new clothes made more sense for the adventure. Unlike a lot of other modern movies, they didn't hit you over the head about her being ""a strong independent woman"", rather, they showed us instead. 

Buzz got shafted in this movie, I wanted him to be more than just ""press the button for your inner conscious"" gag, but him retreating to the RV was a really good way to connect the different character paths. 

The other toys were left out even more. Although Jessie does take over for a bit to justify her appointment to sheriff at the end, it felt like a quick throwaway sequence to keep the family at the carnival. The other toys did do a few rescue stuff, but they were mostly just sitting and waiting in the rv. The whole part about them ""driving"" the car to the ferris wheel was very hard to swallow. I get a lot of pixar movies involve the characters driving a vehicle in an unorthodox way, but I can never really get into those sequences. The cop thing was funny, though. 

Gabby was an interesting antagonist. She wasn't really ""evil"" or malicious. Just kind of creepy, especially when accompanied by the bensons.",c2ntqo

erupzb4,"Thought it was marvellous in being not just a fun delight to watch, but how grounded it was unlike the other films being quite bombastic (nevertheless fun), and the emotion it portrayed in its messaging of purpose and friendship and moving on. It was a film acting as a parenthesis to the trilogy and the ending of Toy Story 3, parenthesis being it could be left out and just watching the trilogy would be sound enough, not that you shouldn‚Äôt watch this one. It was perfect for me. And with that I hope there aren‚Äôt anymore, though I‚Äôm sure there will be in some format if not any films. 

This one actually hit me hardest unlike any of the others, though this might be the timing of me leaving to university in the coming months that has caused such a bias in terms of how I felt. You do reflect on your childhood with these films, they all tick this checkbox, but there was so much more to this film that was beyond that, things that we experience in our own lives as people who have lived. It was a real raw film, but with toys. It‚Äôs a bloody film about toys for god-sake, but it is inspiring with the characters decisions and motivations. 

Boy do I regret selling toys on eBay a couple of months ago.

One thing that annoyed me was how Forky always played dead whenever humans looked at him, especially in the beginning of the film. We know the toys can move whenever they want, they‚Äôre not like Weeping Angels from Doctor Who where they only move when you‚Äôre not looking at them, so Forky, a thing who doesn‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs alive or care for existence and doesn‚Äôt care to be there for Bonnie, would even know how to or care to play dead. He would just freeze on sight even though I don‚Äôt know why he would think it‚Äôs a problem to be seen. He has nothing to lose. 

But yeah. I loved this story the most out of all the films, though 3 will have the best ending. This is a film that is brackets at the end of 3. Music and visuals were stunning, and the new characters were great, with humour at a high. It‚Äôs not necessary necessarily but I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs here. Loved it.",c2ntqo

My only real complaint is that Buzz, Jessie, and the other toys didn't get as much screentime as I would have hoped. For a movie with some romance, I was hoping to see Buzz, Jessie and the Potato Heads have cute little moments here and there. But hey... if you look closely enough we got something.

The screentime the others did get (especially >!Jessie!<), was meaningful and after thinking about it for a bit I see why it was done that way. >!They had to hold down the fort and the seeds were being planted for Jessie.!<

eswg698,"Here‚Äôs my thoughts on some of the new characters:

BO PEEP:

Surprisingly good ‚Äì she didn‚Äôt fall into the trap that most ‚ÄòCutie to Badass‚Äô types do where they swing so heavily to the tough side, resent anyone resembling their former self and become an untouchable and unfaultable Mary Sue. She is still able to express her former traits ‚Äì her nurturing and supportive side without her being stripped of any of her power or being seen as ‚Äòweak‚Äô. Among the sea of half-heartedly done ~ strong women ~ Mary Sues, she is genuinely a warm but tough, well-developed character who is both believably capable and, funnily enough, ‚Äòhuman‚Äô. She feels genuine. Pixar surprised me with her, and all the reservations I had about her melted when I actually saw her on screen.

DUCKY AND BUNNY:

Get rid of them entirely! They‚Äôre less funny than the two sidekick birds in Rio! I really don‚Äôt understand the appeal of comedic relief characters like this ‚Äì they act ‚Äòbombastic‚Äô and ‚Äòcrazy‚Äô and that‚Äôs supposed to be hilarious? In my opinion, way too much time was spent on their repetitive jokes, which cut down on the amount of characterisation allotted to the other new characters. The thing was, unlike the ‚ÄòSend Dad to jail‚Äô line, nothing came of their Plush Rush plans.

DUKE CABOOM:

A fun, fantastic character who would have benefited so much from extra screen time. As biased as this may sound, I could go on for hours about this adorable little stuntman. Keanu Reeves did a fantastic job giving life to him in his voice and mannerisms. He‚Äôs what Ducky and Bunny wished they could be ‚Äì over-the-top and loud, but unlike the two plushies, he shows a vulnerable side which perfectly cuts the outrageousness of his ‚ÄòCanuck with all the Luck‚Äô persona. Not saying that all comic characters have to be serious sometimes, but there was just something about him that clicked where it did not in the other main comic relief characters in TS4.
I‚Äôd have liked to see more jumps from him, and more importantly - failed jumps. Maybe he is more a hinderance than a help to Woody and the crew at first. Show him at his lowest, at how he feels about disappointing his kid and not being made to live up to the commercial‚Äôs overblown claims, and how he wants to somehow live up to them until he realises life isn‚Äôt about living up to these unrealistic expectations of him. Ideally, have him incorporated into the Gabby rejection scene, where he sees even a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù toy can get rejected, and that it‚Äôs not his fault and that he has to let go of his expectations of fulfilling the kids heart before he can perform his miracle jump ‚Äì He becomes his own ‚Äòperson‚Äô, which may also be reflected in Woody‚Äôs character growth arc.
I think, despite his short screentime, he was definitely the most charming toy out of the new toys, and I would like to see more of him in future endeavours such as Toy Story shorts.",c2ntqo

I‚Äôd heard that it was going to make adult‚Äôs cry (and I‚Äôve definitely gotten dust in my eyes‚Äîok a lot of dust‚Äîduring some of these: TS 3, Finding Nemo, Up) this one just didn‚Äôt reach that level.

Also (and I fully admit that this I feel silly nitpicking about this, but the toy‚Äôs were so much more BOLD in this film. In the first one, it felt like they were pushing the boundaries of their ‚Äúrules‚Äù by travelling to pull off their mission. In this one, they just run and jump along awnings and picnic tables like it ain‚Äôt nothing, and it kind of takes some of the tenseness out of the proceedings because, like I said earlier, it just feels like they have the Marvel capabilities to do whatever they want.)

The Gabby doll‚Äôs character was kind of half-baked. They could‚Äôve made her development really solid but instead it just felt kind of like a lazy switcheroo (it was a nice sentiment though, I just wish they figured out a way to do the earlier scenes without making her such a calculated and remorseless villain). Also, it‚Äôs really weird how absent Buzz and Woody‚Äôs relationship was. Yeah, their hug was awesome. But it would‚Äôve hit 100x harder if they‚Äôd had some solid bro moments. I agree that Buzz seemed dumber than usual but I think that was more a result of his presence being boiled down to pretty much one repeating gag which would‚Äôve seemed less idiotic if he had more scenes to round out his prowess and abilities. 

The animation is amazing and it was really beautiful to watch. The film had a bunch of great laughs. And it was fun. I think for anybody expecting this movie to be so bad that it retroactively ruins the franchise are going to be disappointed because it‚Äôs far from that. Worst thing I can say is that it‚Äôs an above average kid‚Äôs film and probably won‚Äôt resonate with most people for too long the way TS 3 did and some of Pixar‚Äôs other greats.",c2ntqo
es3cw4u,"Went to watch it yesterday and have given it a day or so to process just so I don't express my opinion based on impulsive feelings that I feel or felt during or straight after the movie. Must say, regarding the ending...no, I didn't like it whatsoever. Undoing how perfectly Toy Story 3 wrapped things up for a pay off that was heavily foreshadowed was just not my cup of tea at all. We have Woody, a character who was willing to sacrifice going off with Andy to stay with the gang, drop it at the tip of a hat to join Bo and co - and what, based on three sessions of Bonnie not playing with him? Just didn't sit well enough with me. I guess also I was very much blindsided by the fact that this was going to be a Woody-centric installment as opposed to giving the gang one final hurrah made me feel quite underwhelmed by it all. Maybe a rewatch may remedy this though, now knowing what I know. Although watching Buzz get dumbed down, Jessie/Bullseye not having much of a role to play and seeing the original gang be subject to spending the film in a trailer doesn't sound too appealing. Did not appreciate giving Gabby Gabby that redemption either, especially since she ended up getting the voicebox in a brute force manner - for it to mean something, having Woody voluntarily give it over would've made for a better touch. Felt way more satisfying seeing Harmony reject Gabby Gabby than the little kid going off with her at the end.

&#x200B;

With that being said, there were some great moments. Animation - amazing. Everything about the opening from Operation Pulltoy to the ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" montage - brilliant. I did like the new characters, introducing Forky was a masterstroke; exposing us to Duke Kaboom and then giving a very relatable backstory was very nice and could feel that anguish linger on in him and the recurring gag of Buttercup wanting the dad to go to prison was humorous. The ""plan"" scene too of breaking Woody/Forky out from Gabby Gabby/Benson's clutches too, while not quite as good as the predecessors, was good; very chaotic so very Toy Story. Randy Newman hitting it out of the park once more with some nicely made songs too.

&#x200B;

All in all though, I do come out of it a bit disappointed. The fact that I want a Toy Story 5 to sort the mess that Toy Story 4 has dealt up is quite telling to me, a sentiment that I didn't have at the end of Toy Story 3.",c2ntqo

When I saw the scene in TS 4 where Woody started thinking about going with Bo, I just squinted and thought - this seems like financial story telling for the upkeep of the franchise rather than a plot that sticks to its core values. 

It was a good film in isolation, but I don't think it was a worthy successor to TS 3. Ah well. I still don't really believe hit happened. Woody + Buzz are still united in my mind.",c2ntqo

esfz1ad,"TS4, was good, but it's easily the weakest of the four. And knowing based on other comments that there were re-writes, I now know why it didn't end the way I expected. 

I expected and hoped that Bo would end up going with Woody and the gang just like Jessie and Bullseye did in Toy Story 2 so she could be with her family again. I expected Duke, Ducky and Bunny to follow suit as well given that **all three of them said they wanted to be with a kid**. 

I'm also disappointed that there was no kiss between Bo or Woody whatsoever, especially in the embrace after Woody decides to stay with her. There seemed to be a lot of romantic tension  there, or at least the potential for it. 

One smaller thing I didn't like was that Pixar changed the way young Andy looked. Yes, I know that Pixar's software and other tech is changing, but it's just something that bugged me. His face and head shape are completely different.

Also, Andy's house in the ""9 years ago"" prologue is a completely different house than the one in 2 and 3. In 2 and 3, it has a garage on the right side. In 4, it has a *driveway on the left*.

I personally think that the Toy Story saga should have been capped off at 3. Toy Story 4 seems to take the message of its predecessor of staying together and throws it out the window. Bonnie made a promise to Andy to take care of his toys and her promise is now broken, but hey, at least Woody is happy. Hell, 3's closing theme was titled ""We Belong Together"" and the efforts that the gang made to stay together in that movie seem to be all for naught!

That being said, I did still enjoy TS4. The original Toy Story was the first movie I ever watched as a baby, and it's one of the cornerstones of my knack for film. I cried like a baby at Toy Story 3, and I did shed a few tears when Woody said goodbye to his family. 

8/10",c2ntqo
erq6gal,"I really didn't like it.

It felt like it was really *trying* to be sad -- to which, I suppose it succeeded, because the end of the movie felt akin to a character death. But it affected *everyone*.

For one, I thought it was super shitty to paint Woody as being ""in the wrong"". He was completely right, *he* was the one being *loyal*. Bo Peep, specifically, was *completely* in the wrong. But it just didn't suit the ""agenda"".

And really, Toy Story 4 really felt like it *was* pushing the ""female empowerment agenda"", to a truly obnoxious degree. Suddenly she's this experienced, adventurous ""survivor"" that don't need no man... I dunno, it just felt very forced (which is honestly pretty typical of Disney anymore).

In any case, it just left everyone on really unsatisfying conclusions to their stories. So Woody and Bo live happily ever after, and all of the other toys... what? Are still ""living under the illusion"" that Woody did?

But then, what are Woody and Bo even hoping to accomplish? ""Being toys for *all* the children""? That doesn't make sense, because for them to ""live the dream"", it means the kids who play with them *have* to throw them away. If they don't, then they become ""tied down"", just like they were before. And what if a kid -- like Harmony, who clearly liked Woody -- kept one of the toys, but not the other?

It felt like they were *trying* to instill some kind of life lesson, but it just didn't land. It was too heavy to be a ""fun, upbeat adventure"", too depressing to have a happy ending, but not meaningful enough to have a satisfying ending.

Honestly, it kind of tarnishes the series for me, because it no longer leaves off on a ""happy note"". In fact, that's true of *most* of what Disney has been doing lately. Do they just *not* want kids to have happy, satisfying ends to the stories they enjoy? I honestly just don't understand it.

Also... I was fine with Forky. If anything, though, I was disappointed how quickly he ""turned around"". I loved the idea of him being this *thing* that questions why he exists, asking all these big, heady existential questions in what's clearly a kids movie. I thought the initial trailers highlighted a hilarious concept for him, but they just go in a super boring direction and have him just be ""a regular toy"" (for all intents and purposes) only a few minutes into the movie.

Also, it felt *very* short. But I guess that's because there really wasn't much substance -- or humor -- to the movie.

Definitely the weakest the series. I'd personally still put Toy Story 2 as the best, following by the original, then fairly distantly trailed by Toy Story 3, and Toy Story 4 going even further behind.

Really, I just want some fun, upbeat adventure stories again. Don't try to push some ""agenda"", and don't make a *bummer* of a movie.",c2ntqo
et5gc5k,"The animation was seriously incredible but the fact that Woody decided to leave his best friends for Bo made me really unhappy. I get that reality is hard and endings are difficult but would kids really be thrilled to see Woody leave all of his other friends? THIS IS A MOVIE MARKETED TOWARDS KIDS. Its not so much that Disney did a bad job with the plot, but it makes people feel bitter instead of bittersweet. Also Andy told Bonnie to take care of Woody and what if he comes to visit her and finds there is no Woody? \`\\\_(T\_T)\_/\`

 Also I kind of despise what they did to Buzz Lightyear. Its like what happened with Patrick on Nickelodeon. Hes more of the comic relief now more than an actual character that contributes much to the plot. 

Also it always seemed strange to me that Woody went as far as he did to save Forky because he \*helped Bonnie get through kindergarten.\* Bonnie has other toys, right? It seems a little stretched and unrealistic just to make a plot out of it. 

Another point: Gabby Gabby is the one were supposed to feel sorry for even though she planned to FORCEFULLY remove Woodys voice box? Its as if a hospital patient tried to rip out your organs for their sake. Sure Gabby needed it and it would have helped her, but the fact that she was going to rip it out of him without consent got to me. 

A different way I would have ended this movie was change Woody and Bonnies perspective and make Woody enjoy sightseeing with Bo a lot, yet still feel a loyalty towards Bonnie and a love for playing with her like any toy. I would also make Bonnie notice Woody for a moment and remember how much Andy loved him. Then Bonnie would take Woody and Forky home, and Woody and Bo would say goodbye but promise to text eachother with toy phones. (The last part may or may not be a joke.) 

It just seems like Woody out of all the toys would be one to LOVE kids and playing with them. He stayed with Andy and Bonnie for years, right? So he must find an attraction to being a toy. The whole exploring the world thing seemed like Woody would enjoy it, but not as much as his kid. Woody obviously has a special place in his heart for kids.

There was really no reason for this movie to be made except obviously for the sake of making money.

The film itself is, ok but it's not great and has some serious problems with it that make me really question what exactly was the point of this film.

A whole lot of the film relies on some really absurd things, and they really take the whole living toy thing a bit too far into the realm of just too hard to believe. 

Worse is that the introduce some genuinely really annoying characters that feel utterly unnecessary and lead up to a gag that feels outright taken from Family Guy. 

They also (Sorta spoilerish comment) regress the hell out of Buzz for no reason at all other than to do some stupid stuff for the plot to move forward. It doesn't make sense and frankly it irritated me the entire damn film. What was the point of doing that to a well established character?

A lot of the film has stuff happen just to make the story happen, rather than having a believable flow. It's irritating, and pointless.

 There's points of the film where it really starts to rush the hell out of the story and throw pacing out the window.

The visuals are great, they tried some new cinematic approaches and it works very well. Pixar made a really great looking film with familiar characters, but this is easily one of the worst films they've done in terms of story, barely beating out The Good Dinosaur.

I just watched it today and what made me sad was how they just crapped on the entire franchise by taking away something from Woody and giving it to a psychopathic doll. Plus I think it was dumb for Disney to end it like that because they could do this franchise for a ton of years and make money off the Toys. Also Toys get passed around, so I mean when Bonnie grows up she could give it to Andy's kids which would likely bring him back into the picture. But I find Pixar is losing too much creativity, last time I remember Pixar being creative was with Upside Down. Last one I truly loved was Up and Wall-E, which are the two best Pixar movies in my opinion.

And that leaves me feeling more disappointed than I should.

Because while this movie was fun and had lots of great moments it felt like it had nothing new to say and that is disappointing.

Woody is a dick again. The toys are separated again.

Also, that trailer showed promise, as did the idea of Forky. In a world of DIY and with all the angst around immigration to lean into a toy struggling with it's self image and they could have easily delved into what even makes a toy.

Instead, it was a lot of rehashing old Toy Story concepts that were already dealt with better in previous films.

A review I saw also mentioned how the sandbox could have really expanded on that as an allegory for the gig economy. And that's so true. It could have basically challenged the idea of toys being only dedicated to ONE child.

But instead it went back to Toy Story and Woody was still hung up on Andy.

Apparently, he didn't have any character development in the last 25 years.

The new characters (and their subsequent voice actors) are easily the best elements within the film. Unfortunately, the rest of the film falls a bit flat.

Personally, I felt that the movie lacked any sort of central message. Seriously, what's the morale of the story? There's Forky and his suicidal tendencies...but that's dropped within minutes. There's Gabby's voice box...but Woody gives it to her and we're supposed to then feel bad for her.

&#x200B;

Also, did anyone else think this movie looked a bit uncanny valley-ish? The humans don't look very different than the toys and the toys look too polished. I didn't remember Woody's nose ever looking that sharp.

&#x200B;

I kind of hate that the C list characters (Mr Potato Head, Rex, Hamm) barely do anything in the movie. Shit, even Buzz has little to do. To make matters worse, the film has to give us a flashback at the beginning to make us feel anything for Bo and Woody's relationship.

es527bb,"I didn't really care for this one. I've seen the previous three, and genuinely love the first two. The third was alright, but aside from the furnace I felt it was forgettable.  


That's why I'm so conflicted over Toy Story 4. I was one of the ones who voted a 5/10 in the poll just because of the mediocrity. One thing I can say is that Pixar has come a long way with their animation. The ""Camerawork"", animations, scenery, it was all superb. I can honestly say this is one of the prettiest looking movies they've released recently. The story however is where everything just fell apart.   
For one, I'd be lying if I didn't say the beginning was displeasingly slow. Up until the point Forky jumped out the window I hadn't enjoyed a single moment. It was charming sure but the entire ""keep forky out of the trash"" segment felt more like a pixar short than an actual part of the movie that should have been dragged out as long as it was. Once the characters were out and about again I felt the movie actually started to pick up, but unfortunately the characters all tended to suffer personality-wise.   
A great example of this is just how long we had to wait until Buzz started doing anything. Until the conscience part the only real characters we had to focus on were Woody, Forky and to a lesser extent Bonnie. But to be blunt, they aren't entertaining characters. Woody is depressing, Bonnie is depressing and Forky is for over half the film, just annoying.

There were a lot of choices in this film that I just didn't understand. A good example would be making toys even ""want"" or ""desire"" life without a child, which for the first three movies was established to be the one governing trait all toys shared. It also may just be because Bonnie is so much younger, but was it just me or were the rules of being undetected entirely thrown out the window in this? Woody was constantly risking detection, Buzz was as well. Plus was there a reason we needed to try and feel sympathy for Gabby? We got that angle in the third movie with Lotso. I don't see how the viewer is supposed to empathize with what is essentially a psychotic organ thief with ego issues. Especially when she doesn't even make it back to Bonnie, it makes it feel like the writers wanted to shove as many storylines into this movie as possible regardless of how well it flowed.   
Overall I think it was just, okay. It was a mediocre movie, and I don't think it was as cleverly written as the previous entries were. You start on a low note, you end on an even lower note if you ask me, and the neglect towards the classic cast was pretty disappointing. Just think of all the toys working together and socializing while on the Al's Toy Barn journey, and then cut to any of the scenes with them in this movie to see my point.

The ending to Toy Story 3 packed such an emotional wallop that I just can't see this film in the same light as the trilogy. Didn't care for the new characters as it meant all the others ones we've grown up to love were just sidelined, including Buzz!. As for the ending to Toy Story 4, I felt it made little sense character and story wise for what Woody did, it all just felt off to me. Can't say i'll rewatch this instalment again.

eror3t1,"Whenrthe OG toys and Woody embraced for the last time, I started sobbing and I'm not ashamed at all. More bittersweet than TS3 ending and it didn't feel tryhard, either (I know, unpopular opinion but they did make it a point to make you feel bad in that movie). 

Not too sure where to hold this amongst the other movies. I'm glad they didn't try to one-up the previous movies because it doesn't get more grandiose than an airport tarmac and number 3 already played the nostalgia factor too much. It had a story to tell and it did. It didn't feel like a cash grab and it didn't rely on its predecessors to prove its merits. Woody's story arc resonates with me on so many levels and I love it for that.

erp8kan,"One of the things that fascinated me was the slight dichotomy between Gabby Gabby & Forky.. with one toy desperately wanting something they've never had: to feel what it's like to be loved by their kid for the first time and the other seemingly going through somewhat of an existential crisis for most of the film until he realizes there can be purpose as a toy.  Of course, I might be looking at it the wrong way, but that's what I got from it anyway.

Overall, I would say this film hit all the right notes.  Coming from the marathon of the full series(in Emeryville of all towns), it's safe to say that nostalgia & emotions were running high but I'm just glad that this franchise is still around/made it this far.  The humor, interactions & emotion were in line with what's to be expected from a Toy Story film and I couldn't ask for more. I do have a few gripes such as feeling like most secondary characters take a back seat this time around.  It's a bit understandable since this is mostly Woody's story but it felt like some didn't get nearly as much shine compared to previous entries. Don Rickles' absence was certainly felt with Potato Head getting very few lines. Hell, I can't remember much from Slinky either but this is one of the few franchise were every character, no matter how minor the role, plays a crucial piece of this puzzle that make this series what it is.

TS3 truly was the end of an era, in some aspects, as this felt like both a follow up & a standalone in its own right.



All that being said, it was still pretty good. As soon as Buzz revealed he was referring to Bonnie after stating ""she'll be okay"", that broke me.  I was trying hard to fight back tears during that final scene and I'm still coming to terms to, what's most likely, the end of Woody's arc.  I love this franchise to death and being around to see at least one more film in my lifetime is a gift in itself.  This series will always hold a very special place in my heart.",c2ntqo

Hmm idk, this one was kinda hard for me to judge. I'd liked it but at the same time it feels skippable coming off of 3. I think my ranking would go something like this: 3 > 1 > 2 ‚â• 4.

There was no reason for Buzz and the others to be featured more, his arc is complete now that Bonnie likes them.

I guess from an emotional standpoint I was 11 myself when 3 came out so kinda coming back to this series as an adult and being hit with that right off hit that nostalgia real hard.

Also, I don't think Tom Hanks and Tim Allen would have agreed to do it a 4th movie unless the story was up to par. They don't exactly need the money or the job. But yeah, my theater was kinda bare.

erto23q,"Pixar has produced a couple of Toy Story shorts, and so I couldn't help but see this as a long ""short,"" if you know what I mean. It just feels unnecessary. I think they really overplayed the Buzz joke about ""using your inner voice,"" and they honestly reduced him to an idiot like he was in the beginning of the series. Also, Bo's character was not really an important character in the first two movies, and she didn't even appear in the third one, so it was kind of jarring for her to be the reason for Buzz leaving his friends - she still feels like a minor character, even though she got lots of screen time in this one. Also, the characters voiced by Key and Peele felt like something straight out of one of those obnoxious kids movies - think Secret Life of Pets. Overall, I thought the animation was great, but the film is unnecessary and doesn't live up to the first three.",c2ntqo
etu86ut,"Toy Story 4 felt more like an old classic movie from the 40s or 50s, impeccable storytelling and deep insights that are amazing if you want to sit down and analyze a beautiful story. From an entertainment perspective, it was a little lackluster. In a sense, the movie felt like a ""critics film,"" in the same way as movies like Citizen Kane or Vertigo. I don't think it was any worse from a critical perspective than the other Toy Story movies, but for a general audience is wasnt what they look for.",c2ntqo

You know damn well that's going to tug at the hearts of watchers in about 10 years when adults have kids of their own and the strong nostalgia of the past helps shape them for the future in their own twilight moment. 

It really came to me now but I wouldn't be surprised if Pixar went this route. Not to a T mind you, but having themes for the young and old and bridging the gap of the past and the the hopeful future, it would work well.",c2ntqo

I know Bo Peep said the whole speech about how there's a whole world out there, but Ducky & Bunny wanted a child. They were also trying to compete against each other to see who Bonnie would love more, although towards the end it's like they completely forgot about the chance to actually be played with by Bonnie.",c2ntqo
errlyxy,"Just saw it now. Too much for me to write out, but, god damn. I thought this was a very good successor. It blew me away how likeable, misunderstood and sympathetic Gabby is, I really liked her throughout the course of the movie, and she's also surprisingly adorable, for being meant to be one of those unintentionally creepy 60 year old dolls. Her dummy henchmen were fittingly and charmingly disturbing, and gave me big Goosebumps vibes. Lots of genuinely funny moments like that Combat Carl always getting left hanging (smiled for him when he finally got it in the post-credits Pixar logo gag), the Dad jail thing, and the cutaway gags, the latter of which I think is unusual for Pixar films. Tin Toy was a joy to see, I'm sure whoever got to animate him was honored.

The ending hit me like a train. During my viewing I didn't like that Gabby went to that one kid, but in hindsight it makes so much sense. And when that one big decision was being made, I kept on going ""No...he can't be...he can't be leaving"", and it hit me like a fuckin' freight train. It takes a *lot* to make me a sniffling, tearing mess but Pixar managed to do it like they always do. I'm elated to see my childhood favorite TS side character RC in this one (albeit briefly), Randy Newman on the score was fuckin' great to hear once again, I was pleasantly surprised to hear You've Got a Friend in me in the theater again, as well as a great Andy/Bonnie montage. So much bliss was felt during that 1-2 minutes. The animation and visuals are a clear step up from the seemingly-impassable TS3. This series is really a good time capsule for how far computer animation has evolved over the past quarter century. Even with the little gap between 1 and 2, the '99 movie has a TON of lighting and camera improvements and more complex animation than the '95 movie. So much just looks photorealistic now, that goddamn cat.

I was really liking Bonnie and wanting to see her grow up more like we grew up with Andy, but this conclusion makes sense...it hurts our hearts, but it makes sense. I...honestly cannot fathom how they could make a sequel to this one, but I don't think we'll see it for a long, long time. I'm willing to bet that a good amount of people think this ending was even more powerful than 3's, and perhaps even a better one. But either way, it's another great chapter to this series.",c2ntqo
errm4ec,Okay if there's another one it could be a prequel explaining what Woody did for those thirty-or-so years before Andy.

They should have done a montage for Bo similar to what Jesse got in TS2. They could have used Woody's story about the reason they originally bought Bo Peep and really tugged at the heart strings.

ertgr8x,"A perfect worthy successor to the spectacular trilogy that we all know and love. That ending hit me hard as hell, though. Considering we never see RC in Toy Story 2 or 3, I actually thought he was going to get lost or die in the beginning for a second. Glad I was wrong. Storywise, this film certainly proves that Pixar actually cares about their greatest property. Many will say this is just a cash grab, but it's far from it. Pixar is telling a great tale that will be looked at many generations into the future and will still be regarded as a great franchise that it always will be. Many are saying Woody's decision was dumb in the end, but in reality, it actually makes a lot of sense. Forky is becoming Bonnie's Woody just like Bonnie became Woody's Andy. Woody has had his destiny fulfilled. Now it's time for a new one, which is Forky. And if you think about, this was foreshadowed at the beginning of the film when Woody helped Bonnie make a new friend and near the end, do the same thing for Gabby Gabby. Now Woody has a new purpose which is helping other toys find their kid. His character did the same for Buzz once they got along with each other in the first film. He helped Jessie for the exact same thing in the second film; finding a kid. And in the third film, He helped find a kid for the entire gang, which was Bonnie. Now he's doing this for every toy. A lot are saying this ending decision was out of character for Woody, but I have to greatly disagree for the above reasoning. Toy Story 3 served as a great ending for these great characters and Andy's and Woody's arc. And now Toy Story 4 served as a great ending for Woody's complete character arc.


*My favorite cameos:*

Luxo ball on Forky's 'feet'.

Pizza Planet Truck tattoo on that guy that ran the shooting gallery. Not sure if the actual truck was seen anywhere in the film physically though.

Combat Carl action figures as a reference to Toy Story of Terror and Toy Story 1.

The Ellie badge from Up.

Dinoco.

TinToy. And considering the short came out in 1988, it could've been the exact same one. 

Was that the eagle constitution toy from Toy Story Toons: Small Fry? He didn't look to be in a vehicle of sorts, but it's certainly the same looking eagle.

The emotional themes are extremely resonant with, well... growing up, accepting loss, moving on, seeing the bigger world. I like that the Woody and Bo didn't ""kiss"" at the end.

I definitely think Woody really should have lost his voice permanently after sacrificing it to Gabby and been with Bo forever, though I fully understand that is way too dark for a 4 year old. Maybe I just didn't get the film.

-Buzz was side lined and turned into an idiot
- It felt to me like they wanted to treat Woody like how the MCU treated Iron Man and made it seem like the whole saga was his arc and completely side lined many of the other characters
- I enjoyed KMK and Jordan Peele's character when they didn't have to talk as much. Some of their dialogue was clich√© and cringey
- I didn't really buy Bo Peep's story. It's obvious they wanted to appease the feminist crowd by turning her into a badass when she was never more than a possible love interest and was completely forgotten by the third movie

erpfpiu,"So, i have a lot of thoughts. I'll try to explain, but I'm also sick as a Slinky Dog.

A majority of the plot did not work for me. It pays off in the last act, but all that comes before it makes no sense to me. 

What happened in the two years (according to Wikipedia, don't have an alternate source) to make Bonnie switch from Sheriff Woody to Sheriff Jessie and why does Woody feel so nostalgic for Andy if it's been so long? 

Forky was fine, but he really didn't do anything for me. The whole Gabby Gabby storyline makes no sense (also, how is Gabby speaking? How is Woody speaking? Don't they need that voicebox to speak?) 

The Bo stuff really worked for me. That shot of Woody in that flashback was almost horrifying.  Love how they gave the Goats a personality. 

Duke Caboom was easily the highlight of the new characters. The new characters were okay, but Caboom actually has a storyline that really gets fleshed out.

The ""just leave me Forky"" was the moment that should've ended Woody's story for me. We get the Bensons ganging up on Woody, but we never see him wake up. All we know is Forky is in Bonnie's backpack.

Liked the stuff with Buzz, but it does get overplayed.

I feel like the film should've been one of the longer PIXAR movies because this film skirts so many of its characters that by the time the ending comes around, you're left wondering why the other toys were even there.

In the music department, I think this part was either rushed or Randy Newman just wanted to play the hits. I heard a ton of musical cues and even scores that have been recycled from other Toy Story films for some reason.

In conclusion, while I love the last act of the film, I think the rest of the film suffers from having to get to that conclusion.",c2ntqo

Woody was basically forced against his will because she held Forky hostage,  Gabby knew he had no other choice, and the whole surgery process seemed terrifying. And then what does he do? Help her when she doesnt get what she wants. I cant believe it. I thought right then and there Gabby would get what she deserved, for trying to use others in order to appease her own happiness, but no. They give her a dramatic, happy ending. Fuck Gabby, worst disney ‚Äúvillain‚Äù ever, and Hans exists.

Tldr Gabby basically manipulated and forced her way to woody‚Äôs voice box and got a happy ending. She didnt even have a change of heart. Horrible character and i honestly cant believe Disney would support such.",c2ntqo

es1cas6,"It's a fine movie. Felt like an epilogue for 3 rather than its own movie but it works as that. Swear they hired Keanu Reeves just to have him say woah to the Lazer eyes bit at the end. That's what it felt like, like these new characters were written based on their characters. Forky is like Buster and Bunny and Ducky are just like several characters played by Key and Peele. Which is great because that's how animation used to be where the characters were written for the actor rather than they try to come up with a character and find the biggest name to fit them. Probably the funniest of the Toy Story movies and certainly not a bad sequel over all.

But, it didn't try to be its own movie it just felt like a sequel a continuation of a movie. But that's just my minor nickpick. It's also understandable why the focus was on Woody and Buzz over the other toys because unfortunately some of the actors who played these characters passed away. I'm not sure if they can make a sequel to this and I do not envy anyone who has to write the follow up. 8.5/10",c2ntqo

es28t2j,"It was a decent watch, but it completely undoes everything Toy Story 3 presented.  


Agree with some saying it's an epilogue. It was clearly inferior to the 1st 3 Toy Story movies for me. By a good amount.   


Toy Story 3 should have been the finale.",c2ntqo
erq2auk,"I enjoyed the ""consciousness"" subtext, 

The toys always had levels of self awareness in all of the movies, for example, the fake buzz and zurg arc on the second film. But this time it felt different, didn't it ? 

I felt that this time there were more levels of consciousness and I will try to rank the toys according to those.

Lvl 1 : recent animated forky - ok this one is obvious, I think that forky is the best element of the movie at first he can barely talk e don't get his new role as a toy.

Lvl 1,5 : buzz in toystory 1: buzz is so comited to the role that he don't even know that he is a toy, it's funny that forky don't go to this fase, he goes to directly to the drunken Mrs. Nesbitt stage.

Lvl 2: pretty much all of the toys, buzz arc 1, forky arc 2 - they know that they are toys, and don't question, using a West world phrase, ""the nature of your reality"".

Lvl 3: Gabby arc 2, buzz arc 2 - they are up to something, they know that is something wrong with this ""inner voice"" stuff, and bought cope with it in different manners 

Lvl 4 : Woody arc 1, Gabby arc 3, buzz arc 3:  I think the voice box metaphor is the best element of the movie, well, besides forky, of course. Although they understand that the voice box is not the totality of   theirs counciousness, they still fell pretty compelled to follow the script that they've been assigned. I think that Woody trully breaks when the little girl strip his sheriff badge, and know, although he know that he is a toy, and that kids come and go, if he can't perform the leader sheriff role, wtf is left ? If he can't please a kid anymore why is he even alive? That's why he is Soo obsessed with our boy forky, aka, the best toy ever. Forky it's the purest version of a toy friend, the kid him from scratch to perform a crucial role in her life, like native Americans corn husk dolls, he is that kind of OG . Woody more than any of the other toys can grasp this concept, and try, vainly, to repourse himself as guardian and role model of forky, who at first just don't give a fuck, honestly, this fork is gold I'm telling you. Gabby by the end of the movie also gets it, but she still fell the need to perform, for the first time, her role of a little girls best friend. Buzz finally break the script and interact with a human, Woody also did it in toystory 1. He finally created his own ""voice box"". 

Lvl 5 : thick Bo Peep, Woody arc 3 - woody is finally free from the chains of kid's vassalage. It's cool that although bo peep likes him, she fells frustrated that, after all this time, he still fell the need to perform the manly man Western sheriff, the scene when she demasculinize him in front another broken manly man toy is  one of my favorites of all toystory franchise, my favorite one is, of course, is when forky is brushing Gable hair. The puppet mafia was really creepy. Also, I love the creepy torture scene of the first one, when Sid burns woody. Speaking of  1, remember when Woody had a melt down when he realized he is a lost toy? Turns out that, although not all of them, only lost toys can be trully free. Bo peep, realizes that he transitioned to ""true freedom"", when woody finally gave up his man made voice box to save a toy; he finally freed himself of the cowboy role that he's been playing science the... 50' I guess? I also think that bo peep broken arm must be the element that set her loose from the perfect porcelain doll role, idk, we will probably find out on toystory 5. Woody can finally do what first motivated him to break the script with Sid Phillips, helping toys to find a more meaningful life, he did it. He can finally leave his vassals friend and be a rouge suzerain with the love of his life. 


Although I liked the movie, I felt that like forky, it didn't have to exist, but in the end, I was glad that it was made, maybe it's the best cash grabs ever made. But I felt cheated leaving the theater, Pixar deliberately exploited my inner child for money. When I first heard Buzz's voice i immediately started crying, they know my weaknesses, they created them when my mom bought that almost mithological green VHS, and they will exploit us again, whenever they fell like making a shit load of money. We are all vassals to house Disney and they know it. In the end I felt just like buzz; in one hand happy that woody got yet another happy ending, but in another, found myself unable to let go. 

By the way, so you think that woody and bo peep had sex after the credits? I mean she kissed him a lot in the end of the first one, idk. Goodbye

Forky was a lovely little toy and I cannot wait to watch his disney+ series.

Then the teasers and trailers started rolling and I got more and more excited... so of course I went to see it as soon as possible (to be honest I would‚Äôve seen it anyway). It was even better than I ever thought it would be.

I loved the storyline, the animation (the rain, details like how certain toys move differently; I cracked up whenever Forky would walk, so on point), the fact that the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù wasn‚Äôt actually bad, Woody‚Äôs arc made so much sense for his character... it was funny and emotional and everything I‚Äôve come to love from every other Toy Story movie.

This movie did it. Toy Story (and more specifically Woody) means the world to me and the shot of Woody and Bo running into each other's arms made me shed a few tears. The beginning almost got me too when a stick or piece of trash that I thought was RC for a second washed down the road.

The movie wasn't perfect and I don't think it's better than 2 or 3, but it was still a great entry to the franchise, even though I was very skeptical going in. 

My biggest complaint was that none of the old toys really did anything other than maybe Jessie, with the movie choosing to focus solely on Woody, Buzz, and Bo along with the new cast. It worked for Woody's story but makes it feel a lot less like a Toy Story movie. I also wasn't a fan of how Buzz was a huge idiot this movie, I feel like he kinda got shafted the last two movies with not being himself for the majority of 3 and not being competent for this one.

Overall I can't complain too much, there was a lot of good in this movie. I especially loved how they played the music from the Toy Story 2 intro after Buzz goes in search of Woody.

I was all on board for most of it.  I thought the practicing tea time scene was the wonderful kind of writing you'd expect out of Pixar.  It made the villain sympathetic and makes the blow when Harmony rejects her that much more impactful.  At first I thought they were going with a message that taking from others will not improve yourself.  That you are who you are and you should embrace the things that make you, you even if others may deem them bad/wrong/broken etc.  

But then, minutes later she uses this very thing she stole to find a kid and achieve happiness.  Was this earned?  Make no mistake, she stole something from Woody and made his life worse for her own benefit.  What message does Gabby's fulfillment say?  Taking from others will go unpunished and actually be rewarding?  That if something is 'wrong' with you, that you are unlovable until you are fixed/normal?

It left a bad taste in my mouth.  It would have been nice if she could have comforted that kid at the fair, broken voice box and all.

It's a little worse this time because all the toys sit in the family's RV rather than go look for Forkie, who was the highlight of the film for me. Keanu Reeve's alongside Key and Peele's performances were just great. Forkie was a bit more childish and I think kids would like it more, but I think Key and Peele's performance was more aimed at the adults in the cinema.

Ending was terrible, beginning was terrible, Woody repeatedly getting himself in trouble once his friends got him out was infuriating.

Overall, I still think 3 is the best of the franchise.

This was a good movie. The characters were great, the humour was fun, Bo Peep was cool to see return, the antagonist and her goons were appropriately creepy, and the movie made me cry in the end, but there were a few moments in the second half and later finale of the movie that broke my suspension of disbelief.

spoilers ahead,

&#x200B;

THE GOOD

Firstly, the new characters. I loved them. Well, most of them. GiggleMcDimples is probably my favourite of the new gang. Duke Caboom had some great Canadian jokes, I always love them. Meeting an off the grid Bo Peep was interesting, and wow the Antiques antagonists were creepy. While I usually like Key and Peele, their characters were‚Ä¶ okay at best for me. They were funny at times, but most of the time I felt they were kinda obnoxious and taking the spotlight away from the current issue/conversation a bit too much.

Secondly, the animation. MY GOD, THE ANIMATION. If #1 was a nice first foray into the world of 3D animated movies, then #2 was a good improvement on it. #3 was a near-perfect rendition of their stylised world. Then comes #4. This new movie is practically photo-realistic! The environments, the toys, well, basically if you take everything except the CGI humans a lot of it looked so real. That opening scene in the rain was the most gorgeous thing they‚Äôve ever made. It‚Äôs amazing how Pixar‚Äôs tech has evolved over the years.

Thirdly, the plot. Woody being a babysitter to Forky, and teaching him the ropes on how to be a toy and what it means is a great idea. Meeting Bo Peep again was cool too. It was a fairly nice ending that wraps up the series in a nice, final way, I just hope Pixar leaves it alone this time. 3 was a great ending, and this is too. So just let this franchise have its graceful death!

&#x200B;

WHAT I HAD PROBLEMS WITH / AM CONFUSED ABOUT

1. Keep in mind that I‚Äôd just watched the 3 previous films beforehand, but the plot was once again a ‚ÄúX toy is lost! We need to get them back to \[owner written on boot\]‚Äù. Yeah, I saw the trailers, but given that I‚Äôd already seen that scenario play out 3 times before, it got a bit on my nerves. I can‚Äôt make a better plot for the film, yeah, but I have to admit that the formula was a bit stale in the long run.
2. The plot jumping between locations in the second half was a bit much to take in. The Antique store to the Carnival to the RV, and back again, on and on and on‚Ä¶ Not to mention how the RV ended up leaving the carnival, but they somehow got the parents to loop back to where they just came from.
3. Unfortunately this one‚Äôs my fault. I expected the film to take a dark turn in the last half. Sorry, the last two films kinda set that precedent, with the ‚Äúhelpful, kind, but actually manipulative villain‚Äù having our heroes at the end of their rope. Gabby Gabby here wanted Woody‚Äôs voice box, and throughout the film they made it seem like a really creepy and awful act. It was clear that if they got it, it would be really bad or Woody wouldn‚Äôt let them keep it. But, when Gabby finally got the voice box, everyone was fine with it. I was under the impression that if the antagonist got the voice box that would equal ‚Äúthe heroes failed‚Äù.  
Looking back, I really didn't feel the stakes were that high in this film compared to previous ones. 
4. More 3.5-ish. I‚Äôm not so sure why the film made a big deal out of why getting Woody‚Äôs voice box was suck a bad thing. It‚Äôs not like Woody wouldn‚Äôt be able to speak with it out ‚Äì Gabby Gabby talked perfectly fine throughout the whole movie, and even when she ripped it out to show him at the start, it‚Äôs not like she couldn‚Äôt speak anymore. There‚Äôs also the idea that if a toy doesn‚Äôt have a voice box/ their voice box is damaged, they‚Äôre worthless and no one would play with them. That‚Äôs not true. Just ask my 8-year old self. I played with many a toy in my childhood years, and many of them didn‚Äôt even have a voice box. Heck, I even owned actual Woody and Buzz toys, and when the batteries would be low on Buzz‚Äôs voice box? I didn‚Äôt care! I‚Äôd keep playing, I‚Äôd eventually replace the batteries, but in the long run it didn‚Äôt matter to me whether he had a cool gadget that could talk.
5. It felt kinda weird to have Woody actually leave the gang at the end of the film, given how much he‚Äôd done by that point to get back to the RV (with Forky in hand). I saw his departure coming a mile away, but I thought my expectation was subverted by that point.
6. This is a minor nitpick: Are we supposed to believe that the father was trying to unlock the RV the entire time the toys were talking and hugging on the awning? That was a good 3-5 minutes! Maybe more! I half expected the RV to up and leave in the middle of all that.

**TL;DR: I probably didn't catch the themes of the film, and why Woody is suddenly done with being played with, despite his whole quest to get back in the movie. I thought the antagonist's objective would cause harm to Woody. Other minor stuff.**

So, yeah. I liked the movie. I probably need to see it again to get my mind wrapped around it all (both because I now know the full picture to think back on and because that was 7 hours of fun Toy Story stuff, so a lot to remember). And this movie, while good, I think has its fair share of flaws, and felt a bit disjointed near the end. I also wish that the original gang of toys got some more screen time, since I don‚Äôt remember too much from them in this film.

Ranking best to least best: ~~3 > 4 > 2 > 1~~. Number 3 is on top. #2 is above #1. I'm undecided on #4 right now.

ervcaj3,"Say what you will about the plot, or the way the characters personalities are portrayed, but the least believable aspect of this franchise is often wear and tear for me, lol...

Woody & Jessie still have their hats, and in this movie, we even learn Woody's badge is removable. Jessie was previously in the hands of high money collector, so I could believe her hat survived to a point, but Woody is a cherished family heirloom from the 50's... and sees more wear and tear from playtime than any of Andy's other toys... there's no WAY he still has that hat AND badge after 50+ years... especially being a rag doll often gripped around the waist.

Very few to none of these ancient toys show any major signs of paint ware. The details painted on both Woody & Bo's faces are as sharp as ever (and again that's after decades of play. Not to mention Woody had his head stepped on early in the movie.)

Giggle McDimples, despite being a lost toy, had her WHOLE polly-pocket style playset intact!?

All the barbies are not just fully dressed, but dressed to match, with their hair still styled. And quote unquote ""main"" Barbie, we'll call her, actually stays fully dressed and coiffed from the flashback we see in Toy Story 4, to the point Molly gives her away in Toy Story 3. Anyone who's ever had or been a daughter or a sister knows how foolishly outlandish the concept of a non-nude Barbie whose hair is untangled is over the span of several years, lol

And OH MY GOD... Slinky Dog's Spring! Are you kidding me!? I couldn't keep a slinky straight for longer than a month as a kid, and these toys use him as a bungee cord, a tether, a forcefield only susceptible to dinosaurs. His Spring would be garbage!

On the flipside however... at least Bo's arm was believably broken off, and I appreciated that in this one Buzz's stickers were showing signs of wrinkles/peeling, if you take the time to look at them.

I was actually also impressed in Toy Story 3 when I noticed Trixie has signs of paint chipping on her horns. Why that doesn't extend to so many other toys baffles me, lol.

But yeah... these toys should be way more beat by now.

Second, I freaking hated when Woody's voicebox was taken out. And I wished so hard that Woody and Buzz wouldn't be separated by the end of the movie. I'm really glad about how things ended with Woody and Bo, because I love them dearly and have wanted their happy ending for a long time.

This one hit me more because seeing these toys have to say goodbye to each other was beautifully heartbreaking. These toys have been together for years and it really hit me when they had to say goodbye to one of their own. 

I did also feel like Woody‚Äôs choice of leaving Bonnie was not that hard considering she didn‚Äôt even really play with him. But the choice of leaving all his friends vs. staying with Bo Peep is the real dilemma even if they tried to shoehorn in ‚ÄúBonnie will be okay‚Äù at the end.

On a side note, can we say that Bonnie is trash?

I haven't watched any of the previous Toy Story movies since TS3 came out, but this is much funnier than I remember them being, to the point where much of TS4 is a straight up comedy.

In the mold of the rest of the series, there are lots of heartfelt moments, and a bit of (gentle) sheer terror.  And, as with everything Pixar, a few callbacks to other movies and shorts - >!the [Tin Toy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffIZSAZRzDA) who's the antique shop toy club bouncer/doorman, and the antique shop owner/grandma looks a lot like somebody we've seen before, but I can't figure out who!<.

Definitely entertaining from start to finish with solid comedic moments, great action, nice emotional beats and even, dare I say it, genuine scares on occasion.

I'd also say that this one definitely doesn't pack the emotional gut punch of 2 and 3.

Also, can we discuss the implication suggested by Bo's car? Is that thing made out of... ""dead bodies?""

We all seemed to agree though the ending kind of dampered the good though. It doesn't make much sense for Woody to do what he did. It does in the sense he is not played with and is happy with Peep, but it doesn't because seeing his kid happy and the other toys has always been what made him happy. That and Toy Story 5 hype is kind of meh now without Woody. I don't think the characters are strong enough on their old to carry the movie.

This was probably a little heightened but I think it still felt in character. It was a bit drax-like, not understanding Woody's metaphor. Which is in line with his background as a space toy.",c2ntqo
err0xen,I was so worried this movie never needed to be made but wow I was totally blown away. From now on pixar can make as many toy story movies as they want I don't care!,c2ntqo
err9d78,"Wow that was good. The best way to compare this to the trilogy is that it's a standalone film and doesn't really belong in the Andy trilogy (that's already perfect on its own), but this works really well as a standalone sequel. Only a Toy Story movie can genuinely make me laugh and nearly cry multiple times in a single sitting.

I liked seeing RC again. Before Bullseye RC served as the ""fast toy"" plot in the 1st film and he looked so sad going down the drain. I knew Pixar wouldn't kill him off but still had me on the edge of my seat from the beginning.

Bo Peep's transformation from a laid back feminine sheep keeper to a kick ass female warrior was awesome. She really completes Andy's gang and I missed her in the 3rd.

I absolutely loved Key&Peele/Keanu Reeves in this. They were so freaking hilarious. Pixar is so good at using its characters to create genuine authentic laugh rather than the fake cheap inappropriate laughs I'm so used to in ""comedy"" movies nowadays.

Gabby was an amazing character. While she was an antagonist, she never came off as menacing once she showed why she's trying to fix herself just so she can experience a kid's love for once. This feeling of inadequacy and loneliness hit home for me and her providing herself to a lost kid got me most choked up in the film.

Buzz's inner voice plot had me confused and was close to not liking it, but it came full circle when Buzz was the one who assured Woody to follow his own inner voice rather than doing what he's *supposed* to do.

And when all the Andy's gang came up to hug all together one last time, man I nearly lost it there. To see all the toys that I grew up watching depart, especially Woody and Buzz, it hit harder than Toy Story 3's sendoff. 

Overall, the only thing that didn't work for me as much was Forky. I like the concept they were going for, but because of Bo Peep's sub plot, the main plot didn't seem to be as concentrated as the last 3 movies.

This is a great ending to the series. I have no idea if they will do another one since they doubled down with Woody's departure but I would not be surprised if they came up with another genius idea to continue this perfect franchise.",c2ntqo
ersv6oe,"I just got out of Toy Story 4. I'm surprised with how existentially intense it is, and how heavily it focuses on the character's inner conflicts. I really liked how the movie showed sympathy to the ""evil"" character. The overall pacing felt a bit rushed, and forced because there was so much premise to cover plot-wise. Structurally, the characters go through quite a lot to force themselves into situations where they can meet and also establish new characters. The emotional conflict feels strung along so that it's resolved right at the end. There are a lot of filler resolutions that happen so that the pacing and arc doesn't feel muddled, like the comedic character arc of the Canadian biker. 

You can tell that there must've been a lot of heavy revision and editing to figure out how all the parts of the story can come together and work out. Ever since the new age of structurally well-done Marvel movies, I've noticed that action movies in general are crafted better to avoid those middling moments and figuring out how to craft better scenes that establish the plot, and keep it moving forward so they can focus on the progression of the emotional arc. 

The humor is so hyper than I remember the last movies, like the scenes where the carnival animals talk about their plans to get the key. The movie definitely knows the emotional beats that it wants to hit through out the story, and it does it best to shepherd you along all the scenes to make it happen before you can catch a breather and wonder how you got there. 

On a side note, Bo Peep is like meme-worthy thicc. I like the whole fashion statement of giving her pants rather than a very constricting skirt. It functionally lets her do her stunts, but kind of has a thematic statement, especially with turning her skirt into a cape. Like it kind of attaches the idea that there's strength and power in typically sexually objectified parts of the female form.

I liked the nice touch of her having a snapped off arm, like it gives her a sense of rough history which she's conquered, and I guess she's like an amputee technically? I like her whole character change of being an independent woman.",c2ntqo

I said. ""Did you lose a little Buzz? And a little Forky?""

esloeiq,"The film was completely ruined for me by a two year old and a baby in the audience making noises the whole way through. There was a lot of plot, dialogue and jokes to focus on and getting distracted by intermittent toddler noise...ugh, so inconsiderate and selfish of the parents for bringing their children along who are clearly not gonna sit still and quietly for that long and ruining it for everyone who pays money to enjoy the moviegoing experience (we fed this back politely though to cinema management and they were very emphatic and gave us complimentary tickets).

From what I remember it was technically very impressive animation-wise, new characters had some very funny writing and the antiques shop, fair and RV were great new settings for further exploration for the characters. 

It was decent and enjoyable entertainment, but it does standalone as an unnecessary entry and I echo the opinion that it finished perfectly as a trilogy. Also a bit sad the original cast didn‚Äôt have as much to do, Buzz especially seemed mostly an afterthought. 

I didn‚Äôt get the emotional impact as much either with the arc and the ending but maybe a re-watch with no distractions would benefit to give it another try.

However, I was very pleasantly surprised upon watching this movie. I really enjoyed the fact that they were able to touch on new themes. Woody deciding to move on from clinging onto his identity as Bonnie‚Äôs toy/guardian brought a lot of emotion to the story as a whole. It brought closure to Woody‚Äôs story, from being a friend and playmate for Andy, to feeling more like a concerned parent for Bonnie, and finally choosing to follow his own path. Everything felt like a natural progression, and Woody‚Äôs conflict proved to be a fantastic emotional core to the film.

Any time I see any of these movies, I rewind and am shrouded in the simplicity of an early childhood often spent playing with action figures (plus ""Toy Story"" is my childhood movie.   That said, I highly enjoyed this entry too.

&#x200B;

After the trailers featuring a suicidal spork of all things, I went into the theater fully expecting this movie to be an artistically poor, blatant cash grab that would stand as another of countless examples of franchise athletes and films embarrassingly grasping for clearly bygone glories, hanging on too long.  I was proven dead wrong.

&#x200B;

I thought the humor was genuinely funny, Hanks put on another ace performance and Christina Hendricks held her own despite this being her first Toy Story film and having to share the spotlight so frequently with Hanks.  Pixar's animation as always delivered (though not as breathraking as Coco), the story was heartwarming. I was fine with the existential crisis/accepting the changing of life's seasons motif that I think gives the older fathers, grandparents, people seeing elderly loved ones decline, etc. something to invest in. I think the ending nicely punctuates that message. Rather than being sad, I took it as being a sweet way to give Woody an almost guaranteed outlet for relevance again (and they have alluded to Woody/Peep being together since literally Toy Story 1).

&#x200B;

Not much to complain about in my view Buzz clearly got the short end of the writers' pen and Gabby Gabby's whole arch felt abit rushed/unpolished to me (especially considering how thorough Sid, Prospector/Al and Toy Story 3's antagonistic elements were), but that's my only detractions. I imagine some will be salty about the end, but shit Woody's journey at home was clearly headed for more uselessness, followed by a yard sale where he may or may not be picked up by a boy who'd ever play with such a dated toy again if not the trash can or living in the void of an attic box forever.

**Another great effort to me. Wouldn't put it in in my Pixar top 5 (Toy Story 1 would never move out of my favorite Pixar film slot, gun-to-head I'd objectively admit I feel Up is Pixar's magnum opus, TS3 was a hell of an effort that eclipses this,  Monster's Inc, Nemo, Coco and Inside Out for its ingenuity are also clearly superior in my view). Don't think I'd have a qualm with placing TS4 after that though.**

err9up4,"Most of the jokes landed, the new characters were welcomed additions, and the overall general plot and themes were great. The main issues with the movie are the writing, the lack of creativity and rushed pacing especially at the end. The writing never gives the characters a chance to stop and have time to just take in the moment. Especially with the OG crew, its understandable if they dont have much to do, but they also dont have much to say. Theyre in a carnival but its mainly just running back and forth, could have been more utilization of the whole park. The final act is way too rushed without any big set piece aside from the RV thing, and the goodbye could have been given more air to breathe like 3. Maybe instead of the RV rush, Bonnies family are having a campfire before they leave while all the toys are under the RV and a more happy goodbye as a mirror to saying goodbye to Bo. Despit this overall its very worthy and great addition to the franchise, even if the movie within itself had some issues.

In the third film, he learned to let Andy go, but he still believed that the only purpose he could serve would be unto a kid.

The fourth one confronted that belief and the confrontation arrived in the form of his long-lost love. And goddamn it, it might have been the best film in the series. I loved the themes and the writing was top-notch.",c2ntqo

es38n77,"> Forky was fun but I found it hard to care too much about finding him considering he was basically garbage and in my head I thought he'll break in 2 weeks anyway. 

YES! Oh my god, Bonnie's parents cared way too much about that thing. I'm not one for being harsh with children, ya know, respect what's important to them and their underdeveloped, exaggerated fears and emotions and confusion, but DAMN, it's a fucking fork. My mom loves children so much, is so sweet with them, but even she said, ""There have to be limits. I would've just said, 'No, we're not going to keep looking for the fork, I'm sorry, honey, but you can make another one. He's not real.' Kids lose things, they lose crafts, it doesn't matter."" I cannot get over that the message Bo was trying to hammer in, that ""kids lose toys all the time"" ended up applying to Woody in the end instead of Forky. Forky should not be that special to her. It's a plastic fork with googly eyes. He IS trash. Woody was an heirloom passed down by a family friend. Let the kindergarten craft be trash. How is that thing still around a year later when she started first grade?",c2ntqo
es1szfn,"I agree, I felt they almost dumbed down Buzz in this movie and the original characters where just a back and forth ‚Äúrescue party‚Äù without depth like toy story 2. 
It should of been called ‚ÄúThe adventures of Woody & Bo peep‚Äù or some shit because they felt more like a spin off or fan fiction to me.
I liked Bo but she was never a main character and tbh I didn‚Äôt care enough about her story, I liked the mystery behind her disappearance felt more real, they are toys and stuff like that happens all the time. And she wasn‚Äôt Andy‚Äôs toy. It‚Äôs great that she became independent but we didn‚Äôt need that from her, we had Jessie a strong female character who was pushed to the sideline because of it. The movie focused wayyyyy to much on new characters and I was so frustrated with Bonnie for caring so much about Forky, I get it, but she had all these toys and chose to sleep with the fork..... and didn‚Äôt even care about loosing Woody she didn‚Äôt even notice, which made no sense because she was so fond of him in the 3rd movie. I struggled to not get annoyed at her character for this. 

I feel the morals have just completely changed for this last story, toy story for me was all about friendship and loyalty not just to children but to each other as a group, and woody was the strongest believer in this. It stretched the realm of their reality too far, so what‚Äôs the point of being a toy in the end if they are going by that logic, why even hide from humans? 
Also Bo peep wasn‚Äôt meant to be a toy that could move around, she was a fragile doll, immobile for most part, and glass as in her skirt should of been glass and really she should have no legs at all üòÇ. This is why she was never apart of any rescue party‚Äôs. The inconsistency just frustrated me, it‚Äôs convenient to the plot but breaks the the rules of their reality.

Better to think of it as an epilogue, focusing on Woody's story. TS3 is still the true ending for all the others characters, and their ending is unchanged in #4 as they're still with Bonnie. Woody however had a bit more to him as the main character, and this is his story and ending.",c2ntqo

erwujvq,"Dolly being in charge of the toys in the room makes sense- Toy Story 3 portrays her as the leader of Bonnie‚Äôs room; Andy‚Äôs toys, as welcome as they are, are all new additions to an existing ‚Äúsociety‚Äù. Woody creates some unintentional friction with her by overstepping boundaries, which isn‚Äôt done maliciously; he‚Äôs just not used to answering to anyone, to being a ‚Äúmember‚Äù of the leadership instead of heading the whole hierarchy. Woody recognises her authority but has trouble adjusting to it. Dolly has every reason to be a little irritated by this, while still being willing to defer her authority outside the house.

When it comes to planning missions in the face of alarming situations, Andy‚Äôs toys have all the experience that Bonnie‚Äôs toys don‚Äôt, and more experience than most toys ever have. Outside the confines of Bonnie‚Äôs room, it makes sense for them to look to Woody for leadership during emergencies, because that‚Äôs where his natural talents- wiliness, bravery, out of the box thinking- really shine. As Woody‚Äôs best friend, partner, and second-in-command, the toys look to Buzz in Woody‚Äôs absence. Buzz is loyal, dependable, great at leading fire teams and making calls in the field (aka, a ranger ala Green Lantern expy).

However, Buzz isn‚Äôt comfortable in the administrative role; it‚Äôs why he takes the first opportunity to situational leadership to Jessie, then jumps out the window in the pursuit of a much less amorphous goal: finding Woody. This is nothing new; in Toy Story 2, it‚Äôs Bo who presumably stays behind to manage the affairs of Andy‚Äôs room- Buzz leads the mission to bring him back. In Toy Story 3, Jessie was the one leading the opposition against Woody over the decision to go back to Andy‚Äôs, or stay in kindergarten; Buzz opting to not back Woody‚Äôs decision was treated as a departure from the norm. 

Woody shares his leadership over Andy‚Äôs toys with Buzz and Jessie. Between the two of them, Buzz has gotten comfortable as the dependable second in command, while Jessie‚Äôs natural ‚Äútake-charge‚Äù attitude (along with her initiative and willingness to argue with Woody over what decision was best for the toys as a whole in TS3) was what had Woody leave her the sheriff star.",c2ntqo

3. The little girl then gives Gabby a voice. Saying something like ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôm lost too.‚Äù Showing how kids use their imaginations with toys to help themselves work something out. Also showing that Gabby never needed a perfect voice to be loved.

When he's spending so much time explaining to Forky why he is a toy and why he matters to Bonnie, all while being exhausted/not as capable as he once was- it kind of starts to show the themes of the movie and letting go of things you once focused so intensely on and choosing your own happiness.",c2ntqo

Same for his friends. They find out hes leaving and they just hug it out. Like....what? Basically your brother who you've been with 10 plus years leaves and you're most likely never going to see again, and they're just like ok, bye!

They also barely focused on any other character's but Woody, Bo, and the new ones. Buzz was a secondary character and it felt so wrong. 

Finally, Bo just kind of rubbed me the wrong way for whatever reason. She told Woody she was staying and when he comes back to her, she couldnt be like, ok woody, I'll come with you. Or at least make him go back to his friends? They reconnected for literally less than a day, and Woody decides to leave all of his friends and his ""responsibility"" he was talking about all movie for her. Definitely the wiener talking.

I think Toy Story 4 really fleshed out the tech that was first seen in Piper.   


The subfurface scattering on the toys was insanely accurate, it's most noticeable on woody's hat where the light piercing through is most noticeable but it's pretty much on everything since most of the materials shown have that propriety, from plastic, to cloth, to leaves, it really brought the toys to life imo.

I totally agree Woody giving Jessie the badge was the big tear jerker moment, but the ending just didn't some together like I expect Pixar to do.  Like how Coco out of nowhere just clobbered you with emotion when we learn the real meaning of ""Remember Me"".    


THere was SO MANY possibilities with this movie.  The antique store could have had so many other scenes.    


I was expecting a big Star Wars scene.  The little one that was there was hilarious, but way too short, and my son missed it.

I thought this was more of a problem with Bunny and Ducky than Duke Kaboom. They were just Key and Peele, they didn‚Äôt have any character. Pixar has never done that before besides like Mater. 

They usually pick celebrities that service the characters they‚Äôre playing like in Inside Out or even in Toy Story 3 with Michael Keaton. But Key and Peele just played themselves, It felt very Dreamworksy.",c2ntqo
errjmre,"> Buzz, and the original gang as a whole, get no scope in the film at all. They might as well not have been there. The only reason the old characters, especially Buzz, were there was to give us the parting scene between him and Woody which to be honest, isn't great. The idea of Buzz and Woody parting can make a person emotional, however it has nothing to do with the way it was handled in the film. I can get choked up telling you how Andy goes over all the qualities of his toys as he hands them over to Bonnie. I have no idea what Buzz and Woody said to each other, other than Bonnie will be fine without you. I mean him giving Jessie the badge is more moving than what they did between Buzz and Woody.
> 

Did the rest of the gang need to be in the movie more? The movie was about finding your purpose after already doing so, the other toys had Bonnie. Still, I found the idea that Woody was the only toy not loved by Bonnie to be contrived.

> There is no appeal to the lost toy life, especially for Woody. He gives up his friends and the love of child for Bo; a love story angle that the original Pixar guys said they would avoid. Woody's problem was that he missed Andy, missed being played with and missed having purpose. The lost toy life doesn't resolve any of those problems, other than Woody gets to be with Bo. This is a clear sign of someone ignoring character arc and motivation.
> 

Woody also loved helping his other toy friends and in the credits, he is shown still doing that with the toys at the carnival. 

> They undid the ending of Toy Story 3. Woody enjoyed being with Bonnie and liked being played with, hugged, etc. Bonnie also loved her toys. Andy gives up Woody because he can see how much Bonnie loves him. However, in this movie, Bonnie unnecessarily pushes Woody aside. Woody is still hung up on Andy, even though 3 showed us he accepted, learned and moved on. This movie then goes nope, he didn't. How can we then trust the ending of 4? How do we know Woody isn't going to get sick of the lost toy life? Three gave us closure, but four absolutely did not.
> 

Agreed. I think the reason why this movie was filled with new characters was because if they knew that every toy's arcs was complete and having everyone undo their arcs would have been too much. They had to undo one toy's in order for this film to exist, it might as well have been the one we most care about.

> They introduced new characters and focused on them while shunning the others. We never really get to know Bonnie's toys, we get less time with the originals, and don't really get to know the new characters (except Gabby Gabby). The two fluffy characters are only there for their repetitive jokes. They wanted a home but then just stay behind with no explanation. Whatever, the audience will just assume that they wanted the free life like Woody, even though they see the value in being with a child to the point that they help Woody and Bo.
> 

To be fair, they fill in the backstory for Keanu's toy, although fairly hamfistedly.

> Woody's original problem was that in Bonnie's room, he wasn't in control. The typical lesson he would learn is that others have skills and expertise he might not have and possibly accept and respect Dolly. However, that never happens. Even with Bo, he doesn't learn that lesson. She even says that he is right. So what does Woody even learn this movie? How does he grow? It really seems like a movie about a toy running from his actual problems.
> 

Woody's problem is cyclical, Woody will always need a new kid. Bonnie would eventually go to college too should Woody have stayed with her. He would be presented with the same problem. He accepted that his time with Andy was special and that he needed to find a new purpose with Bo Peep.

> Part of the appeal of the original movies is the appeal of every day things. Buzz flying off the car coaster and getting stuck in the fan. The carnival and antique shop setting don't add anything.
> 

I think the angle of showing a bunch of toys who were also lost was unique, and was a good metaphor: they were literally antiques, literally old and worn out toys who needed a purpose.

> Riding off the popularity of Keanu Reeves. Keanu's character saying ""woah,"" although not a big deal here is setting a bad precedent for Pixar that has avoided such self-serving and wink wink references for so long. Pixar has avoided fan servicing but I guess that won't last long.
> 

This movie existing kinda sets the precedent for fan service... This movie shouldn't be real. The only way it could exist is off the popularity of something else, as you stated, every toy had a complete arc. So I agree.

> The problem, with this movie, and others is that they focus on pieces but not the whole. The character arcs, lessons, plot are not fully developed. I don't hate the movie but it does regress rather than move the franchise and characters forwards. It feels like more of a spinoff or a short than a continuation in the Toy Story movies.

I just saw this yesterday, and I agree.  Walking out to my car, I was struck by the fact that Bonnie literally never acknowledges Woody, even when he is right there.  And yet, he still risks everything to get Forky back to her, and he ends up working to make sure more toys can have a chance with a kid.  I think, overall, it speaks well of Woody and doesn't necessarily go against all his character development from the other movies.",c2ntqo
evayueq,"I guess this is because they really wanted to show Woodys character development since the first movie as now we can see that he does not care about being the favorite toy anymore- all he cares about is the kid. Also it goes well with the general theme that the movie tried to portray which is that, that not every toy will be equally loved by every kid. To some people, a Gabby doll is infinitely precious, but to others they don't mean much. It's the same with Woody and I think the whole point of the story was to say that it is okay and it doesn't necessarily proves the worth of a particular toy in general. Just proves that not being with one kid does not mean the end but rather a beginning to an entirely new adventure- which kinda nicely parallels with another Pixar movie, ""Up.""  It's beautiful if you think of it. But I will agree that the film kinda felt rushed to me.",c2ntqo

That being said I liked the ""joyful"" parts in Andy's house and I thought of Andy's house and Sid's house as separate movies in my kid brain.

f0pn1mq,"That's the thing with these movies, they still manage to have themes that are relevant throughout our whole life through the use of parallels.

This is a movie that acknowledges that different people have different ideals and tastes, that it's okay for you to not like something that you feel that you should or someone in the way that they like you, and deals with the repercussions of that to each of the sides.

If there's a critic I have is that it didn't specifically show the repercussions on Bonnie's side, but I get why they didn't do it, still I wish we had a scene where she acknowledged that Woody wasn't there anymore because she didn't care about him enough as she did with Forky.  The movie was pretty much about Woody side, having to deal with the feelings that he wasn't a favorite toy anymore, and for him that meant not having a purpose (something we adults have all struggled with in the form of relationships or even jobs like you said).

The message of the movie is ageless in that regard, ""there are more kids out there"" can be applied to anything in life, in your case game dev wasn't for you, but there are more jobs out there, you can't give up and be stuck with something that makes you unhappy, you must move on (and you did), and find your a new true calling like woody did in the form of being with bo and helping other toys find a owner.

I think it's an important message for everyone and I'm really glad I saw the movie. It's impressive how this series explores the same theme ""growing up"" but there are so many interesting subthemes inside that.",c2ntqo

eroqj05,"I have to disagree on Bonnie being up high on his priority list as Andy. When Woody was explaining to Forky why he had to go back to Bonnie, he misspoke and said Andy. Andy was Woody's entire life. He still misses him even after being given to Bonnie. Now that Andy's all grown up and Bonnie obviously preferred to play with Jessie and Forky, Woody had no need to stay with her anymore.",c2ntqo
eroxuwd,"As you said, he loved ANDY more than anything. 

He was just going through the motions with Bonnie. He was the leader in Andy‚Äôs room, but as much as he tried, he wasn‚Äôt even an assistant per se to the doll who ran Bonnie‚Äôs room. Bonnie didn‚Äôt even say his name throughout the film. 

I felt the film did a really good job of showing how disconnected he was from Bonnie, so that when the time came and he had to choose between his only other true love Bo Peep, and going back to Bonnie, who didn‚Äôt ever seem to notice he was gone, he could finally move on. 

It was a really great way to showcase the ‚Äúempty nest‚Äù feeling that many parents get. What do you do when you‚Äôre no longer your kids #1, when they don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù you anymore? When the role you‚Äôve played for nearly two decades ‚Äúends‚Äù? 

I wasn‚Äôt sure I was going to enjoy the fourth movie after 3‚Äôs perfect ending, but I think overall I enjoyed 4 more. The themes were great, they followed through on all the running gags, and so many storylines came full circle. It was a really well done film.",c2ntqo
erp4975,"Can I just say, also, was that he still enjoyed being loved by Bonnie. When he was hugged by Bonnie to sleep, that was genuine fulfillment of being wanted by a child.

I don't think that the ending makes Toy Story 3 a moot point though. One thing people seem to be most frustrated is that it somehow changes the ending of Toy Story 3... but it really doesn't? Toy Story 4 forces you to reanalyze the ending we were always presented with: the toys' happy ending is temporary. 

This is why I find it kind of frustrating that people act like Toy Story 4 ruined the canon, or stole a happy ending from the characters in any way. If anything this movie gave Woody the ending he always deserved. Bonnie will always grow up and the toys will be right back at the beginning of Toy Story 3. The reality behind TS3's ending is far more sad than TS4's. 

The whole series is about Woody prioritizing his kid's happiness over his own, the toys' happiness over his own, etc. and the entire movie is basically about Woody realizing that sometimes it is OK to put your happiness first. Woody gets to be free now after a long life of putting Andy and his friends above his own wants. That's why the movie is so powerful to me. It's Woody finally ACTUALLY moving on to entirely new goals. Kinda a groundbreaking theme for a movie like this. 

I just don't understand how people can act like the movie ruins Toy Story 3 inherently because the way the story continues, it shows that there is never truly a book end to your story. Living with Bonnie is only temporarily going to solve their problems, and that's okay. That's how life is.",c2ntqo

I felt like Jessie got a quick moment to shine popping the tire. 

And that goes for everyone else, they each had a little set piece or just a line or 2, and that was it pretty much it. Buzz had more, but like you said it felt glossed over. (Duke Caboom cracked me up haha)

As for the ending, yeah it was cute but it felt like it was way too rushed.  It was funny how they got Rv to the carousel but even for Toy Story my realism meter was pushed a bit far off for that scene, but I guess it worked perfectly for ‚Äúto infinity.... and beyond‚Äù... I just wish the actual ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù was fleshed out a bit more?

Anyway, that‚Äôs also why I feel like they left it open for another chapter in the series. Like maybe the carnival swings through town and Buzz and some of the gang go meet Bo and Woody for a catch up.  There‚Äôs many ways they could play it even though they stated it was the end.",c2ntqo

etum098,"Buzz had the best line of the movie though ""Bonnie is going to be OK""

Showed so much understanding and respect and wanted Woody to be happy. 

Whats the point of being with your friends if you're going to be in the closet all day while they get played with? Makes no sense",c2ntqo
etuhb8u,"I guess I'll try to open your mind about it?

And I'll use a different perspective. Think of it like anyone else. 

For example... I love my friends to death. But sometimes you have to say goodbye to find what makes you happy. 


Woody didn't have a purpose with Bonnie. He wasn't happy. He wasn't fulfilled, was just a toy collecting dust. 

It's about the transformation, the other toys were sidelined because they just didn't need to be in it to tell the story of Woody's transformation and change. And Buzz is still kicking in this movie and has a big enough role. He was honestly the most hilarious character for me and he showed real depth and understanding towards Woody in the end. Woody deserves to be happy, deserves to make other kids happy, and if he has to go make new friends and live a different life to do that, he should. He spent YEARS with his friends in that attic. And now he was going to just collect dust in a closet while he watches his friends serve their purpose while he has none. 

And buzz wasn't trying to talk Woody out of it because Woody deserves to be fulfilled and happy. I really can't blame him for going off with Bo Peep.  If anything, this showed how great of friends they are. Only the most unselfish and best friends know to say something like ""Bonnie is going to be OK""... Such a beautiful line. Buzz gets it. He's a bro. And wants his bro to be happy. 

AND Bo and Woody have been an item since the original toy story. I really do understand why Buzz let him go. I mean Buzz saw they were into eachother back in Toy story 1. 

And buzz and Woody's friendship was strong in this in my opinion. They didn't share a lot of lines but it's obvious their friendship doesn't even need words, like on the roof woody says something like how he can't wait to see Buzz's face or something like that. Subtley is key in this movie and they did it so well. 

And yeah you're supposed to feel bad for Gabby. She was defective since day one and has never had ANYONE love her. She deserves what Andy had, and even though she went about it wrong, I still understand why she was so desperate. Think of her as a person. Imagine being ""defective"" since day one and having no one want you. And then being locked in an antique shop for decades. Of course she's going to brutally and violently take a chance to be loved. I really can't blame her. Shes insane and it's not even her fault, so obviously when she gets tossed aside at a chance to have a kid I definitely felt terrible for her. although, I am a psychologist and therapist so I guess there's that aspect as well. I try to understand and appreciate all aspects of people. 

And she even softened up the second time she asked Woody. Sure she manipulated forky and shit but still. She was a lonely doll with mental health issues that clearly were not her fault. 

 And the scenario you made up with Andy coming home and being upset Bonnie lost his favorite toy is crazy and is a way to be upset with this movie imo. That's not going to happen and what college kid is going to visit a random girl to check up on his old toys? Andy's moved on and isn't going back to be a kid anymore. 

I think it was a beautiful movie and is my favorite one in the series. This movie was about self love, and I was ok with the other other characters being sidelined because it was about Woody. He knew all the other toys were happy, he was going through the existential crisis.",c2ntqo
erpiy9s,I saw her too! She was playing that shooting game at the carnival haha,c2ntqo

eru2iqx," I cried before the movie Title card even showed up because I realized how important this series was to my childhood, and I'm now the same age as Andy, and by the time Woody and Buzz said goodbye I was just barely holding back from Ugly crying. I can see why some people weren't fans but I felt that Woody and Buzz parting ways was the only way to truly end the series without feeling like there's another in a few years.

I didn't watch the trailers, just the easier with Forky--I stayed away from interviews/behind the scenes just to go in fresh. Maybe I was a little hyped, but I knew that the core story was over and I tried to go in with an open mind.

I enjoyed the ride while it lasted, but as soon as I walked out of the theater I felt a little sad. All of your points resonate with how I feel about this movie. Maybe because over the last 1.5 months, I have rewatched the films with my wife (Toy Story 2 was the first rewatch since I owned it on VHS) and felt that they were all solid stories.

I liked that even after ~~she emotionally manipulated Woody into giving her the voice box~~ Woody gave her the voice box, she didn't get what she wanted and Harmony didn't want her.  I only just saw the movie and I saw her rejection as vindication for the audience (and Woody).

es2ad2n,"Not to stomp all over your comment but I just completely disagree.

I‚Äôm a young parent. Bonnie starting kindergarten and the little girl lost at the carnival had me bawling imaging that was my kid. I was also a kid when Toy Story came out. Toy Story was my childhood. I had the entire first movie memorized word for word to the point my brothers refuses to watch it with me. I loved 1, 2, and 3. They all had their own thing going and just got together so well.

I was also one of the few people excited for Toy Story 4. Everyone else felt like 3 was the perfect conclusion and they shouldn‚Äôt push it. I really wanted to watch Bonnie‚Äôs story unfold.

I borderline hated Toy Story 4. Who the hell was the intended audience? The story was the same in places it should have changed, and it changed in the places it should have stayed the same. Where it redundantly stayed the same was the entire outline for the main plot. New toy, toys get lost, grumpy toy protagonist, time is running out, get back to the car just in time. And then the entire ending with Woody leaving is so far away from his entire character arch of the first 3 movies. He was perfectly happy with Bonnie. When he wasn‚Äôt Andy‚Äôs favorite toy he was still there for his kid. He gave up running away with Bo Beep all for his life‚Äôs purpose. And now that he‚Äôs not Bonnie‚Äôs favorite toy he doesn‚Äôt care about being there for a kid anymore? Literally just not getting picked to play with 3 times in a single week and he abandons his entire life‚Äôs purpose? Woody, the toy who cares more about being there for kids than any other toy, in a world where that‚Äôs literally all any toy wants, and now he‚Äôs just going to spend most of his time packed away in a circus truck on the road? I don‚Äôt think there was a single toy that ever ran away from their kid. Even Sid‚Äôs toys stayed with him.

Not to mention over 3 entire movies there was next to no development of his relationship with Bo Peep. So there‚Äôs no emotional investment when he‚Äôs choosing between Bo and Bonnie. All of the emotional investment has been put into Woody and his kid.

I also just didn‚Äôt understand the point of turning it into a horror movie for several parts. I just kept looking at my husband and saying wtf over and over. Yes I‚Äôm an adult now, and enjoy a horror movie here and there. But Toy Story is my childhood. I went into that theater to be a kid again, not to see that pile of garbage I wish I could go back in time and burn every copy of whole pretending it never existed.",c2ntqo

This really should be called Woody‚Äôs story, the gang has little to do with the whole story. Even Forky isn‚Äôt as big a deal as I thought he would be, he‚Äôs mainly just a plot device that serves as the only thing keeping Woody from just leaving Bonnie. One thing I didn‚Äôt like was the dumbing down of Buzz who I had previously seen as a smart character the second in command to Woody. Woody and Buzz were the Batman and Superman to this group of oddballs but the buzz I‚Äôve come to know wasn‚Äôt there. It felt like the writers realized ‚Äúoh shit we forgot Bo peep‚Äù after toy story 3  ended and felt the need to explain her absence in order to conclude woodys arc/romance and  every other toy was just dragged along to serve little to no purpose.  The film uses emotional elements that I have already seen and felt were done much better in previous films such as the rejection of toy, the loss of a toy, and the connection a child has with a toy. Gabby gabby getting rejected didn‚Äôt feel as heartbreaking as Jessie being left behind and definitely wasn‚Äôt as compelling as the origin of Lotso. I didn‚Äôt get to know or even care about gabby because right from the start You know she is the villian and her motivation felt so rushed,plain, and expected. Lotso on the other hand felt compelling because even though chuckles was a small character you can feel how hurt he is when telling the story of how Lotso changed and the dance it did, and as for Lotso you have seen him be charming and nice so this a well done reveal. Gabby just feels like a watered down antagonist that I don‚Äôt really get to care for despite her being less ruthless than previous antagonist.  This feels like a DLC to a video game. I got the full story already this is just bonus content that could have simply been integrated into the previous films.",c2ntqo

Also, I think Ducky and Bunny wanting a kid is just the top layer of a deeper desire - the desire to be useful, to be a part of a family and to be cared for - maybe  being a part of the group with Bo, Woody, Duke and Giggles is satisfying enough for them.

Desperate people can do terrible things but that doesn't mean that they can't be sympathetic, just that they'd do anything to achive something that can save them from a miserable life. Once she gets it, she has no reason to hurt anyone anymore and can actually start to live, I think that Forky explaining her Woody's life made her understand even more about the life she wanted, so next time she approached Woody she actually made him understand how she felt and how desperately she wanted to have what Woody had. So it seems fitting to me that after all that she gets a happy ending, she was just desperate, and Woody decided to help her obtain the life she always wanted. That's just my opinion, I get that some things didn't really add up, well just one, why did Bonnie get so disinterested in Woody?

Even putting this aside, I don't think it was great. Way too many characters, bad pacing, it was also somewhat unclear what the film was trying to say. I felt nothing for Bo, who wanted to abandon Forky and drag Woody from what is essentially his family. Plus if you're going to do a film where Woody leaves the gang you should probably have the gang in the film.  


I dunno, the animation was stunning, some comedy beats worked, and I did all in all like it, I was actually quite into the first half. But for me it just took Toy Story away from franchises I can say ended flawlessly, and I felt a little empty when it ended.

And once that exact kid rejected her, she thought it didn't matter anymore, she lost her chance.

To go through that again after Bonnie (knowing, on one hand, that Bo and other toys had those experiences too, and, on the other hand, that he himself was starting to be put aside by his kid) would destroy him, so he decided to take care of himself for once. TS3 gave us the idea that his relationship with Bonnie would be an Andy 2.0, TS4 explained that Woody deserves more than to give joy to a specific child for some years and then be thrown out/donated/forgotten.

2. I don't think that was necessary. They already gave her a flashback sequence. They can't spend half the movie explaining what happened to her. We can easily make assumptions based on what she tells Woody. They are also making a short film about what happened to her. 
3. Agreed. Although he did have some very smart dialogue at the end.

5. That was just a small moment and a nice callback to the earlier scene I felt. It still worked for me. 
6. I don't think it was advertised as that at all. The trailers were an accurate representation of what the film was about. 
7. Forky was completely developed in the first act. They pretty much showed us his entire life.

9. The characters were nothing alike except for them both being really funny.

He's all about making kids happy, and as the ending (and his entire plot spent trying to get Forky back to Bonnie) clearly indicates, his way of making kids happy is by finding ways to help other toys experience the same love he was lucky enough to experience.

To be fair, telling something like that to a 4-year-old and expecting the kid to take heed is kinda expecting too much. She simply was too young at that point to understand the significance of those words.

erpxhun,"You bring up some interesting points, but I thought the character progression for Woody and Buzz were both appropriate.


Woody clearly hadn't gotten over Andy, and was struggling to adjust being Bonnie's toy due to him not being played with. All throughout TS3, Woody was the only one who didn't give up on Andy and still clinged on to the hope that he'd take care of him. The rest of the toys were ready to move on. So Woody makes a split second decision to have himself and the toys go with Bonnie. He had a choice between Andy and his friends, ultimately he regretted his choice by the events of 4. 

The movie reminded me of being in a new relationship after a tearfelt breakup with the person that you thought was ""the one"". You never get over that person, you'll always treasure that time with them. Woody chose to break the cycle of being a kid's toy, and now will do what he's always been doing - being there for other toys and bringing happy memories to children. He couldn't do that with Bonnie, so he felt useless. That was his confliction the whole film - for years he thought the job was about being there for your kid. But what if the kid doesn't particularly care? They're not obligated to love a toy, it's just a toy.

As for Buzz, he's always been very literal and straight forward. By TS4 it's been years since he's been a leader to the toys, and he's become complacent in his role as Bonnie's toy. Once Woody is gone, he starts questioning his decisions. (You say he rescued Woody in TS3, he didn't. Lotso had reset him, and he wasn't fully back to normal until they were at the dump)

The ""inner voice"" sub-plot makes sense for Buzz because he has always relied on his instincts. Woody brings up the idea of a ""conscious voice"" and it gets Buzz thinking.

Another thing, the Toys can subconsciously control their voice boxes  (as evident by Woody in TS1 with Sid, and here in 4 with Bo when meeting Duke) so when Buzz is pushing his buttons - that's him actually telling him what to do, limited to the exact words that his phrases can say.

That's how I absorbed the story, not disagreeing with how you felt. I love hearing differing opinions",c2ntqo
erpv2xh,"I actually liked that they made Woody reconsider his unwavering loyalty and accept that it wasn't a healthy way to exist, and that he needed to find a way not to hinge his happiness on trying to recapture the glory days of Andy.",c2ntqo
erpvfkb,You summed up my thoughts perfectly.,c2ntqo
erq2i5z,"I guess you can look at Woody‚Äôs decision at the end of the movie kind of like what Cap America did in Endgame (going back in time and whatnot). It‚Äôs against his personality/beliefs but finally he‚Äôs doing something for himself. Plus, it‚Äôs clear that Bonnie did not need Woody AT ALL. Sure, Woody was sad that Bonnie didn‚Äôt play with him anymore but he‚Äôs no longer the jealous and petty toy he once was. And remember when Woody told Forky that his job was to make sure Forky did his? So when Forky finally embraced his identity as Bonnie‚Äôs toy, Woody has finished his job. So I don‚Äôt see why he shouldn‚Äôt move on and finally be with Bo",c2ntqo
erq2a4z,"> Woody's story is a retread of his arc in TS2, only this time he makes the complete opposite decision that he made in that movie, which flies in the face of what Andy told Bonnie about Woody before handing him off to her 

Not to mention that it flies in the face of Woody's entire *character*. I haven't seen the movie yet but I am just completely turned off by what I'm reading - I'm a spoiler whore at the best of times, but I already knew I wasn't going to see this movie until I knew what the plot was. 

I remember a few months ago when one of the trailers was posted people were speculating about how this movie would end and I was honestly really skeptical because I didn't believe Pixar would actually go against the arc they'd built up, not to mention go against Woody's established morals and beliefs. You can't spend three movies building up Woody's undying loyalty to the other toys and his kid (Andy and then Bonnie) and then use one to dismantle all of it.",c2ntqo
ers1jq8,Yes you're right,c2ntqo
esch5pq,"I appreciate the other perspective and your reasoning. Here‚Äôs why those things don‚Äôt bother me:

1. Woody‚Äôs arc as an opposite retread: Sometimes a polar opposite decision can make sense as character growth later down the line. I find the idea that what‚Äôs right for someone now to be different than a year from now to be one of the mature themes the series has landed. It reminds me a little of Richard Linklater‚Äôs Before movies, where the characters have a really intense, full, ‚Äúmeant for each other‚Äù arc, and then life happens and the next movie checks in 9 years later. Like with Woody, the previous connections they had are amplified by the realization that time creates new ""true"" paths for people.

2. Buzz as an idiot: Buzz is a B-plot in Woody‚Äôs movie, which I think is fine, it‚Äôs always been Woody‚Äôs story. But his role in that B-plot is not just some ridiculous comic relief, it‚Äôs to wrestle with the concept of inner-voice and conscience. It‚Äôs not Inside Out, but I think it‚Äôs doing a little more heavy-lifting than you‚Äôre giving credit for. Toy Story 3 took the arc into adulthood, and I think 4 brings things full-circle back into childhood in a way that makes a lot of sense. #3 was a send-off for Andy, but #4 hands off the adulthood themes to Woody. Buzz‚Äôs more childish handling of conscience works fine within that story. And while Buzz grows a lot in Toy Story 1, I don‚Äôt think it undercuts that to assume that he still doesn‚Äôt really understand inner-voice. That's still a big concept for kids, and #4 addresses kids more specifically than 3. I don't mean that in a dumbing-down way, I mean that in the childhood -> end of childhood -> creating childhood arc that the 4 movies take.",c2ntqo
etb2120,[deleted],c2ntqo
et7ol3d,"I enjoyed Toy Story 4, but in a ""good"" way, whereas the other movies were ""great.""  It was a good way to give closure to Woody's journey in a very plausible way, but like you said Buzz got flanderized into being a moron and the other characters were mostly background.  I also felt that the second act was emotionally flat and confusing, with a lot of characters running around but no clear sense of what was going on or why we should care; perhaps better direction or a better sense of pacing could have helped, but that middle bit (up until Bo calls Woody out) just felt like a lot of padding.",c2ntqo
etgwm8u,"I agree about Forky, the trailers made him look like he would be an important character. Instead, he was just used as an excuse to set the plot in motion and then he became literally irrelevant.

Also, I didn't like the introduction of female Forky during the credits. I think it might have been a nod to the ending of Toy Story 1 but it felt totally unnecessary.",c2ntqo

erpsgq0,"Yeah that's true about the other toys not really having a role, but I loved the new characters that they brought in and focused on. I feel like if they spent more time with the other older characters we wouldn't have cared as much about Woody's journey because we would be wondering why Woody wouldn't just go back to them. I loved how we got to see bo peep more. This is just my opinion but I felt like all of the old toys are exactly where they needed to be. They didn't really need character arcs because they were just living their lives with Bonnie and they loved it. Woody was the only one that wasn't being played with and felt useless.",c2ntqo

ertedwm,The way that Forky and Knifey moved during one of the post credit scenes felt like it was pure stop motion that I forgot it was actually just animation for a second. Completely stunning and breathtaking.,c2ntqo
eryxyyz,"> Just feels wrong to me that Woody would abandon all these toys he's known his whole life just because Bo wanted to remain a lost toy 

There is so much more to it than that. Don't forget that he very nearly abandoned them in TS2 when he was still Andy's favourite toy. He wasn't even getting played with in this movie. He lost his leadership of the group. He lost his voice box. He lost his purpose in life. 

The key line is after Rex says ""Is Woody a lost toy now"", Buzz replies ""He's not lost, not anymore"". Woody found his purpose at the carnival. Not only in his love for Bo, but also in helping other toys find new owners like you see in the post credit scene.",c2ntqo
eryst4x,It kind of reminded me of Up and the ‚Äúadventure is out there‚Äù mantra. At the end of Up it says ‚Äúon to the next one!‚Äù Woody accomplished everything he needed to accomplish as a toy: he gave Andy a wonderful life and he set Bonnie up to have a good one. He outlived his use for Bonnie so by leaving he‚Äôs going to find a new purpose and adventure with his life,c2ntqo
es1895r,"Except Woody WAS still getting played with in this. Show don't tell, movie! The other toys in the closet just saying ""Wow, 3rd time this week"" is lame, when later we see Bonnie still cuddling with Woody at night, bringing him along on the road trip, and then later playing with Woody and Forky together during the escape attempts montage (probably my favorite part, because Forky is hilarious). This story of Woody finding his own life outside of a child's bedroom would've been stronger if Bonnie HAD fully outgrown him or donated him. It didn't seem like she had, he just wasn't the favorite anymore. He was still her toy, and he was still Buzz's best friend, still a good leader to the toys, brother to Jessie, owner to Bullseye, and protector and mentor to Forky. This was not about not being useful anywhere else. This was about choosing Bonnie or Bo.",c2ntqo
eserlbi,"I remember seen them at the beginning of the movie, when Bonnie came back from school and Woody get out the backpack, they approched him with all the other toys !",c2ntqo
eskhhuh,">and unlike Andy they literally can't abandon her.

Whoa, good point there. That would be fascinating!

&#x200B;

> To state the obvious, this is the end and we're not gonna get another one.  

I wish I could be so confident about that. Who knows anymore?",c2ntqo
esnicsy,"Good comment, but I strongly disagree that ""it's not thematically different from the previous two."" It's very different. The previous two were predicated on the tragedy of being abandoned by a child who outgrew them, but are still very much driven by the idea that having a child is the best thing in the world and it is always grabbing on and riding it out while you can.

This one actually explored the idea of how a toy can outgrow a child, that there is a potential life as *un jouet solitaire*.

>How far back do toys remember? If Woody was made in the 50s, what was he doing before Andy was born?

One of the main writers of the first two movies had this whole backstory for Andy and Woody worked out that never made it into the film. According to him, Woody belonged to Andy's father (who was also named Andy), but got shut away in a box sometime in the 1960s. Then eventually he was dug out and given to Andy, and Woody (I don't know if they go into a toy coma after being left for long enough) conflated the two Andys into the same person. I watched a video about it. I'll see if I can find it.

... OK, apparently that backstory [is probably a hoax](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2017/06/25/ridiculous-toy-story-backstory-debunked/#4a1919095a3d), but damn, it made a good story.

And yes, no matter which way they tried to twist it, this was about Woody choosing Bo over Bonnie and his friends. Nothing more, nothing less. They tried to make it deeper, but it definitely fell flat. If Bo wasn't there, Woody would've waited until Bonnie got a little older or officially gave him away.

Yeah, Molly looked kinda creepy in the first Toy Story, but the toy characters didn't look BAD. Just not super shiny and perfect either. I miss Bo's old look. She didn't need to look REAL.

And by the end, everything that happened didn't really amount to much. There's a different theme of moving on, but is it really that different?

So if that's the case (a stretch, I know), then maybe he was primed to only think instinctively. We know this because he acts on instinct throughout the movies, throwing caution to the wind.

Not to mention I'd imagine most of the conversations the toys have to be riveting with deep philosophical thoughts. I mean, between being Andy and Bonnie's toys, that's pretty much all they think about and do. 

We know Woody has inner monologues because he was designed as a cowboy, a human cowboy. Modeled vaguely after spaghetti Western stereotypes. It makes sense for him. For Buzz, someone who we don't know was designed as ""human,"" I can give some leeway.",c2ntqo

errcx2x,"I completely agree. If you're familiar with Pixar's history, one of the things the original Pixar guys put their foot down on was they wouldn't do love stories. That was one of the things that was going to set them apart from Disney. However, it seems like they just gave that up with this film. The lost toy life appeal has no appeal to Woody. He loves kids, he loves being played with, etc. You can't have a scene with Gabby Gabby helping a child and feeling loves, and then the next scene have Woody reject it all. He simply does it for Bo. He left everything he believes in and his friends who never left him behind for Bo, who willingly left him.

They definitely underutilized Buzz. It was so disappointing :( They underutilized all of the original characters and didn't even let us get to know Bonnie's toys before they moved on to the new characters.",c2ntqo

There are a lot of toys out in the world, and thousands more get mass produced every day. The antique store owner states that no one ever buys the toys in her shop. What are Woody's chances that he'll find another kid who won't tire of him as quickly as Bonnie did, a kid who really gets joy out of playing with him?",c2ntqo
errhf9w,">Still very good, but just wish that maybe Woody *and* Buzz went on this adventure together and that Woody, Bo Peep, and the other new toys went back with Bonnie instead.

ertyyfs,"Woody's entire character has been that you stay there for your owner, period. It's what he always told all the other toys when they were getting frustrated at Andy's growth. 

I personally don't like the character shift that now when Bonnie wants to play with him, he won't be there. He was one of her main toys once as we saw her playing with Buzz and Woody a lot. Based off the clock, Woody wasn't played with for 3 days. It wasn't like it was 3 years.

And to be fair, going into the Antique shop in the first place was for selfish reasons. Sure, Woody didn't know the trouble he was getting himself into, but the mission of getting forky back would have been much simpler if Woody had just gone back to the RV instead of thinking his bae might be in there.",c2ntqo

It does seem strange because she isn't really that important in the first two. There are hints they are romantically involved but that's all. Also the story of how they brought in Bo to Andy's house doesn't add up I thought as she's in the first one, but Molly is only a baby.",c2ntqo
erv4bfz,"Even the ending fucks up the character they made for Buzz in this movie.

Buzz reverted back to being a fucking idiot this movie (Some say the excuse is because he was thrusted into leadership of the toys, even though the beginning shows it was one of the non-OG toys that was the leader) but is somehow so emotionally smart that he knows to let Woody go?

es15bo4,"Yeah, it seemed really backwards. Forky DIDN'T want to be a toy, despite being Bonnie's new favorite and getting played with all the time. Woody DID want to be a toy and belong to a child, despite Bonnie losing interest and keeping him in the closet more often. So if the lesson was that a toy should do whatever THEY want, and not always what their CHILD wants, then shouldn't Forky have left, and Woody have stayed, because Woody loves belonging to a child, and Forky deserves his freedom? I completely agree with you that it never felt like Woody naturally changed his position on this. If Bo wasn't there, Woody would have gone back and then maybe dealt with this ""living independently for myself without a kid"" concept once Bonnie officially outgrew him / decided to donate him. Not now. This was just about choosing between Bonnie and Bo.",c2ntqo

es3x27u,"> It Feels awkward seeing OG characters have no dialogue and just stand there

Exactly. They already had a scene like that in *Toy Story 3* when the toys are going to go to the attic and Woody to college. Parting ways, but in *Toy Story 3* they had just been through not only many years of adventure, but the entirity of *Toy Story 3* was a big heist involving everyone, that almost turned them into molten plastics. That same goodbye getting repeated again in *Toy Story 4* doesn't feel the same.

I consider *Toy Story 4* a fine, solid animation film. But it doesn't have that same lasting effect. It doesn't have anything like the toys turning alive to scare Sid, Jesse's song about Emily or the incinerator scene. That emotional gut punch that instantly makes things 10/10.",c2ntqo
es3py9g,"Whoa. Just saw this last night and you shared so many similar thoughts I had.

I was so upset it was all about this new character and all the OG's were just extras in scenes.",c2ntqo
es3ovbb,"1. I don't agree with this. Bo Beep was a central character in the first two films and then disappeared in the third film and people were wondering what the fuck? This movie answers the question of where she went. Also, that same argument can be added to anything toy story - Oh the franchise has been going on for nearly 25 years, it's been too long for me to care about any of it. Woody and her always had a thing and it's cool to see it come to fruition. 

2. This is a bit Hyperbolic, I agree Buzz's is definitely not written as strongly and mostly played for laughs, but you see glimmers of the past him. I think they definitely put him on the back burner though. 

3. This film is definitely more Woody focused and I think it works better as Woody's story rather than ""Toy Story"" I agree with you a lot of the key characters from the previous films aren't utilized enough, but I think that needed to happen for this story to be told. 

4. Jessie has the entire second film and third film worth of character development for this to be a really touching part. This is the 4th film, the creators aren't assuming people are starting with only this one. I will say though, what happened to Bulls eye? Don't remember seeing him. 

5. I didn't see the trailer, but I think it's more so about your priorities in life change and it's okay to try something different and find another calling in life. 

6. I think there was a lot of good character development in the scenes where Woody and Forkie are walking from where he jumped out of the RV to the antique store. Also, the moments between Gabbie and Forkie were genuine and cute. 

7. She talked him into it when he came back to rescue Forkie and he needed to be unconscious for the surgery. It seems like he willingly gave it to her after hearing what she had gone through. He's already been loved before, she hadn't.

8. I agree. Not the strongest character and a rehash of Ken. 

9. There are a couple story oversights I see, but I think the animation is incredible and the production value is very very high. They definitely put the time and care into this one. 


These are just my opinions on your points. Sometimes movies just don't connect with people for whatever reason, It's okay to not like it that much. I think it was strong and very funny, but I probably prefer the first 3, definitely the first 2 over this one.",c2ntqo

\- But as it turned out, she loved Jessie and Forky more, and Woody didn't get to spend much time with her, and he was more like the grandparent who just cleans up the house or feeds the pets while she's gone.

Ok, I can understand that since that was her favorite toy at the time, but what about Woody? Not a single acknowledgement that he was missing too? This undermine so much of 3 that it pisses me off. Initially, Andy didn't want to give Woody away in 3, when he finally did, he made it clear to Bonnie how special he was. I understand Bonnie might be a fickle kid, but in all the shorts between 3 and 4, Woody was special to Bonnie as well. They changed Bonnie's personality for this atrocity of a movie and to serve the story that they wanted to tell. At the same time, they gave a slap to Andy and the relationship with Woody. Andy gave Woody away only because he knew she would love him. I guess Andy is a horrible judge of character.

Nailed it. TS3 I left the theater so emotionally satisfied, I knew it was going to be a conclusion but I didn't know how it was going to end.

But... again. It wasn't ANY of the other toys that made Bonnie happy. It wasn't even Forky. It was Woody, whose selfless hard work ended up making Bonnie's orientation day a nice one.

So yeah. The movie is pretty much wrong about where Woody's character is. It tries to paint him like he's dependent on having a kid, when it's pretty much proven that the kid needs him just as much.

Your points on woody are valid that he‚Äôs super loyal and cares about making kids happy. The problem presented in the movie is how his loyalty and overly compassionate soul are a problem. He puts others‚Äô happiness before himself, admirable sure, but this movie showed that it was hurting him in the end. We see how unhappy he is being thrown in bonnie‚Äôs closet, that she was losing interest. If that had continued he would become another gabby gabby looking for ANY solution to being loved again.

Bo offered a new life for him. One where he could still make kids happy without being thrown aside, a life where HE was happy for HIMSELF and not on behalf of other toys or ‚Äúhis kid‚Äù. 

For Bo, her stance in the movie was clear, she wanted to continue exploring the world and not be tethered down to one kid. Obviously we see early on that she still misses molly but for her, that‚Äôs life. She gets a new kid and they push her aside. she never had that same connection that woody or the other toys had with their kid, why would she try it again with Bonnie?

Woody clearly didn‚Äôt truly care about getting forky back to Bonnie. I mean he did, but returning Gorky really was Woody‚Äôs desperate attempt to feel useful in the traditional way he fulfilled his purpose. Forky represented making his kid happy which, for his whole life, was the most important thing to Woody.

But... Bonnie is not Woody‚Äôs kid. Andy will truly be the only kid for Woody and this movie showed us the deep struggle Woody went through as he dealt with this transformation. His purpose, in the traditional Toy sense, had been fulfilled as soon as Andy gave him up. Bo represented Woody‚Äôs new purpose in life and I think this movie really did justice to Woody‚Äôs character.

Yes they were bombastic and ridiculous, but they were absolutely necessary as replacements for, i.e. Rex and Mr Potato Head in the main storyline.

Secondly, I thought Duke Kaboom was perfectly done, and I think he's the kind of character that can easily be over-done. He was excellent as a side-character, but given more prominence he would quickly have become wearing.

es3gzoi,">Personally, I felt that the movie lacked any sort of central message. Seriously, what's the morale of the story? 

I felt that movie was an epilogue of sorts for the character of Woody, who was always the lead character. The real ending, at least in regards to the ensemble characters was still #3. But this was about Woody finding new purpose after spending years keeping the gang together the best he could. What I got out of it was that in the first movie, being selfish led him into trouble until he realized he needed to be a leader and keep the toys together so that they'd be there for their owner. The moral of this I felt came full circle as Woody found himself in a position of seeking yet another new path, and Buzz and the rest of the toys basically let him know that it's okay to be selfish sometimes, especially after years of putting everyone else above himself. It's his moment to finally catch a break, and everyone will be fine as Woody passed on his leadership role. Yes it's bittersweet and sad knowing that Woody and Buzz were best friends, but Buzz had found his love with Jessie, and Woody was always trying to fill that void by just always being over-protective of all his friends. Reuniting with Bo gives him that chance to fulfill something he's been seeking ever since Andy grew beyond his toys.",c2ntqo

It especially didn't help that ALL the old characters except Woody and Bo Peep took a back seat and we're incredibly flat. I found it hard to care about the plot when everyone seemed to have been reduced to a shadow of their old selves.

What Toy Story 4 showed us was that although Woody was now technically Bonnie's toy and he was every bit loyal (goes to school to watch over her, goes out of his way to save forky) he realizes it is not the same and the story shows that he never really moved on from Andy. Going with Bo Peep was him ultimately letting go of Andy because he had grown up and letting go of Bonnie because she didn't need him. People may not like this conclusion, which is fine.

Why did Woody choose bo peep? Because she would be able to provide a life for woody. One that stills aligns with his belief of helping kids without constantly being stuffed in a closet where he would become another gabby gabby

Why weren‚Äôt they sad to see him go? Of corse they were sad. But they all knew how much bo meant to woody. Especially characters like the potato heads who have a SO and Jessie/buzz who know woody incredibly well. They would know that this has to be something he REALLY wanted if it took him away from ‚Äúhis kid‚Äù

Woody being missing? I don‚Äôt think the parents would care, it‚Äôs just another toy. Though even though Bonnie didn‚Äôt care as much for woody I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll still be upset to see him gone. But as I said, there is a lot of complexity here and no solution would‚Äôve left everyone happy. But Bonnie will still have her other toys including Forky",c2ntqo
esi7c8n,"A lot of people are gonna interpret this as a 'choosing the girl over your friends' kinda thing. But to be honest I saw it more as a 'choosing a future instead of clinging to the past' move. Bo somewhat represented new possibilities, different places, exciting adventures and most significantly for Woody, to do *something*. It's exactly what they do in the end credits scene, having toys given to childen. Bo also implies she and her friends can still get played with if they want to by different kids if they pose as lost toys. It allows Woody to do what he does best and loves to do, helping toys, whereas with his old friends, his job is done.  


Even though they were clueless without him, the toys will adapt. They have to. Even if they don't, it's hardly fair to force Woody to stay when he's not happy just so they can have someone to solve their problems.",c2ntqo
esgr9ue,"He left because he realized that he no longer needed to be there for Andy, and the whole reason he wanted to babysit Forky was so that he still felt he had a sense of purpose for Bonnie by protecting her favorite toy. But Bonnie doesn't need Woody like Andy did. Bo Peep showed him that toys don't need a single kid to have a purpose, there's always other kids out there to play with a toy. Molly didn't need Bo Peep anymore, and neither did her next owner, and she moved on. He did everything he could for Andy and Bonnie has plenty of toys to be there for her, so he decides to finally move on and go with Bo Peep to help other toys and other kids rather than waste away in Bonnie's closet hoping to relive what he had with Andy.",c2ntqo
esgsg60,"Choosing Bo Peep over Bonnie didn't feel as bad as choosing Bo Peep over all the other toys. Yeah Bonnie would be okay but what about all his friends? In pretty much every movie they've been next to clueless without him, including this one.",c2ntqo
esgbckk,"Ending was super rushed. He got basically no goodbye with the other toys besides Buzz. The Bonnie part is a little more explained‚Äîhe learned that sure she may get sad, but eventually would get over it and would be ok, as Buzz said.",c2ntqo
es37soz,"The movies have always been about loss and growth. The movie uses the device of a toy getting lost to further explore Woody's insecurities. Forky's mentality is also new and interesting. Everyone is struggling to find their place in the world. They both have a crisis of identity. Woody isn't jealous about his human having a new favorite toy but his feeling about making his child happy is still deeply ingrained. He has to learn to be child free for his own happiness to break the cycle. Bo Peep has shown his that it is possible.

I have a problem that Buzz and Jessie (but mostly Buzz) took a step back in development.",c2ntqo

Bo wouldn't want to go home with Bonnie - ""Who needs a kid‚Äôs room, when you can have all of this?"". Woody wasn't getting played with and loved Bo, so it made perfect sense for both of them to stay.

So TS2 to TS3 was approximately 8 to 9 years apart. In TS3 Bonnie is in preschool, so she'd be around 3 or 4 years old. In TS4, she's starting Kindergarten which would make her 5 or 6. So from 3 to 4 it's been around 2 years.

From TS2 to TS4, around 10 to 11 years have passed, and 9 years in the past (based on that flashback) would be roughly 1 to 2 years after the events of TS2.

Sure, us older people will appreciate it because we grew up with it. But by definition it's a children's movie. There was nothing disruptive in Toy Story 4 for me, but when I saw Aladdin, there were quite a few distractions. I was able to fully enjoy the movie and tune out the children, even the ones right next to me, because I understand that it's a movie for kids, and maybe there are parents who have one kid that will be good, but can't find a babysitter for the others.

I could just be blessed with an amazingly high tolerance and ability to tune things out. Maybe my ADHD helps somehow.

Edit: Also, Pixar has the policy of not making a sequel unless they feel that they can do something great with it, or it's necessary. That's how 4 ended up being so good. The only exception seems to be Cars, which they obviously keep pushing out for toy sales.",c2ntqo

It bothers me that Buzz fought to get Woody back from Al in TS2 and then he just so easily give Woody up to someone that doesn't love him. And despite Woody and Buzz being solid at the end of TS Bo still picked Buzz as a moving buddy. Early off in TS4 I was thinking if they go for TS5 they can build it around Bonnie growing up and having a yard sale that Andy's wife happens to stop by unaware that she just bought her husbands childhood toys for their kid and Andy and the toys see each other in the final scene for the first time in over a decade.

I wouldn't call them nonsense, but I can understand how this one would be more your cup of tea. It definitely feels more like the first one than the other two.",c2ntqo
ertlmqs,"Interesting take. I though of it more as Woody making mistakes because of his desperation. 

I do agree about Buzz, his character seemed fairly bland and simple in this movie, but arguably he's not really the focus of the movie. Feels like they just had to put him in the movie because it's a Toy Story movie. I found his whole ""toy voice is your conscience"" schtick hilarious though.

I thought it was really cool what they did with Bo. Turned a porcelain doll into like a badass ranger, and that whole skunk thing felt like Mad Max to me. I never thought ""oh, this is pandering to women"". I just thought ""this is a cool character""",c2ntqo
ertlc0h,">Woody was useless, dumb, constantly making mistakes, and getting rescued. Completely different than T1-3 Woody.

Sounds like you've never seen Toy Story 1 and 2. Woody made many mistakes by kicking Buzz out the window in Toy Story 1 and deciding to abandon Andy to go to Japan in Toy Story 2. Compared to those, Woody's decision making in this film is alright.",c2ntqo

Buzz relied too much on the inner voice bit but only seems that bad because he didn't get as much screentime.

Bo even turns around after talking to Giggles about Woody's loyalty and realises that's just who he is and it's a good thing.",c2ntqo

ertk946,"I didn't like the movie for how out of character Woody was for the entire thing. But I don't think it was because of Bo, I think it was because the writer's had no idea how to end the series with the characters they had, so they changed them all. I felt like Woody would never have given up on getting Forky back to Bonnie just because he saw Bo's lamp in a window. I mean, he never even seemed that upset that Bo was gone. And then to leave every friend he had AND his kid (that he'd spent the whole movie talking about) because he wanted to run around the world with Bo? Nah, get that shit outta here.

I'm a feminist, and I don't think this movie was all that feminist, just ridiculously out of character. Bo was a plot device to end the main story of Woody and Buzz. The only multi-faceted character in the whole film was Gabby, who was fantastic (even if those puppet things were weird as hell for a kid's movie, bleh).

This whole concept would've worked better as a short, featuring only Bo and her crew and showing how ""lost toys"" get by day to day. It was easily the worst film of the franchise.",c2ntqo

They had a huge position of power in writing this script, and they chose to make a positive movie that will have a positive impact on children and adults when they exit the theater.

It's meant to be light hearted and fun. Not everyone has the luxury of writing a review from their laptop for a job. Most people are working 8 hours a day at a job they don't like, without time for friends or family. God forbid a company makes a movie that tries to take their mind off of that in a way that is meant to be enjoyable.

The Toy Story trilogy is one of the greatest examinations of personal loss of our generation. Each one answers a question that the last one asked.

In Toy Story, the movie concerns Woody's jealousy about Buzz stealing his place in Andy's life, and basically asks, how do i stop someone from falling out of love with me? But then it shies away from answering that question. It sort of drops it in favor of Woody and Buzz coming together.

In Toy Story 2, the movie returns to that question, and answers very simply that you can't. You can't stop someone from falling out of love with you. And so you have to enjoy the time you have with them - you need to make every moment precious. You love well while you have the chance, and risk that pain, because it's infinitely better than locking your heart away, shielding it in a glass case where it can be safe and sterile and untouchable forever.

Toy Story 3 then answers the question that Toy Story 2 didn't even know it was asking - alright then, i let them go. And what do i do after that? And Toy Story 3 says: you live your life. You don't forever after walk backwards through life looking back at that relationship. You don't let it consume you. When you let them go, you let them go. You remember the good times, and maybe you remember the bad times too. And then you find new people to love, and that's okay. That's good. That's necessary - the only thing you can do if you don't want to become bitter and regretful and hateful and tied to the front of a garbage truck.",c2ntqo

In the original, he must come to grips with being a toy, the second one involves facing who he used to be, specifically in the form of another Buzz who has yet to accept his toyhood, and the third shows him having lost his memories in a factory reset and staying the fearless, loyal man/toy he was before, even if he was unknowingly on the wrong side.

I don‚Äôt disagree that he felt a bit dumbed down in this one, but I‚Äôm glad they found a way to continue his winding arc without it feeling overdone. And besides, Buzz was never a genius. He might come up with a plan that would end up working, sure, but it was rarely the most well thought-out. Remember the ‚ÄòUse your head‚Äô bit in the air vent in 2? Effective, true, but not likely the best course of action.

Also, there might be some truth in the ‚Äòinner voice‚Äô thing. A couple of times in the film, Woody uses his pull string instead of talking, so it‚Äôs clear that the toys can control what their voice boxes are saying.

es2f3cv,"I was thinking about an article online where Pixar said this wasn't necessarily a direct sequel to Toy Story 3, but not really a spinoff, sort of in the middle. Yet it's called Toy Story 4. They should've given it it's own title and made it about Woody and Bo to really conclude his story. Everything else new character and storywise felt really contrived, unfunny, and uninteresting at the expense of some of the older toys. There's some good changes like the horror elements, but the rest doesn't really work for me. I'd agree that maybe animation alone bumps this to a 7, but this sequel really feels like a strong six to me unfortunately.

&#x200B;

For the new major side characters, Forky was just there to advance the plot and crack one-dimensional jokes that became extremely overused, Gabby Gabby doesn't really garner much sympathy based on the stuff she did for manipulation, but I do like the idea of a villain in this that's not really a villain, the Key and Peele toys were literally just KP in this movie, which became pretty annoying to me, and Duke Kaboom with some great moments didn't really outweigh the other mediocre ones. Bo Peep overall was really cool and her love connection to Woody would really help lead to why he's finally able to give up being some kid's toy as his only purpose in life, but there's not enough development and focus.",c2ntqo

I am SO with you about everything you said regarding loyalty not just to a kid, but to your friends and team. Why didn't they make a bigger deal about Woody and Buzz, Woody and Jessie, Woody and Bullseye, Rex, and Slinky, parting ways? I thought in Toy Story 3 Woody learned that it was more important to stay with the group than go to college with Andy, AND he also got to be with a new kid?

erv3xi1,"I always thought it was about intent.  
If someone played with a toy in such a way that they gave it a personality, it is imbued with that personality.  

That's why Buzz came to life right after Andy and his friends came in and said ""this is where the spaceship lands!"" - as a group effort, they all imagined the character being the one from the show he's from, thus giving him a backstory.  

Andy probably didn't know where Woody was from, so he was born as a generic loyal cowboy.  

Gabby Gabby was probably briefly played with by someone years ago, considering she's in a second hand store, and has been alive long enough to form her own personality.  

And this also explains why there was a deliberate shot of Bonnie playing with Forky before he comes to life.",c2ntqo

This is an amazing take.
  
I got home and thought, ""I didn't like this film as much as the third."" But my daughter loved it. And then I realized how impossible that last sentence was back then, as I wasn't a father yet when the third came out.

2 is Woody learning to enjoy time with his kid while it lasts, instead of worrying about the end  
3 is accepting a child leaving the nest (all the toys cope with this)

erwd1tl,"That's a fair point, but I think Woody's ending hit me in another way.  As explained by Gabby, Woody has lived a very fortunate life in having two loving owners, one right after the other. In a sense, Woody has been sort of ‚Äúsheltered‚Äù his entire life by having two kids. Reuniting with Bo Peep again really opened his eyes on what the outside world could be. 

I think this ending resonated with me so much as someone in their late-20s as I took it as a metaphor for leaving your comfort zone behind and exploring what the world has to offer - the same kind of feeling I felt when I was first going into college and getting the taste of adult life. With the end of Toy Story 3 being the gang staying together and going on a whole new adventure with a new kid, I saw this ending as essentially growing up and seeing what you truly could be capable of in this life.",c2ntqo

erriize,"I guess no appeal may be harsh. What I guess I'm asking with that is, does the movie clearly show this decision outweighing his desire to help a single child and being with his friends? I personally didn't think the movie did a good job of that. It came across more as Woody doesn't like his situation at Bonnie's house and this is better than that, rather than finding a new purpose. There are no other scenes prior of him seeing other kids getting all new toys and walking away happily or Bo finding a lost toy and returning it to a kid or anything. All of that is shoved into the last five minutes of the movie and solely with Gaby Gaby getting a home. Woody isn't even exposed to this life or sees the appeal of it until he makes the decision to stay behind. Also, this solution doesn't really solve his other problems. He still has issues with being in charge. He never really accepts Bo in the leader position. They become a team which is something Woody does frequently in the past. They never show him getting over Andy whom he still clearly misses. The only clear advantage is it's better than being Bonnie's toy.

The Keanu ""woah"" thing is a reference to a Keanu Reeves movie titled Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. He just says woah in that and the phrase has become associated with Keanu over the years. So, it had nothing to do with the movie or the character, and was simply a reference to a famous thing associated with the voice actor. It was more of a, look Keanu's character said the thing.

The most heinous villains in real life only do their deeds because of prior circumstances they didn't control.

It would be different if she just stops playing with her toys, like she's too nervous about school and just cries, etc. That would compel Woody to accompany her to school so she would feel better and want to play again. However, it's not that. She's just, as OP said, a dick, and stops playing with him even though he was her favorite of her new toys and Andy specifically asks her to take care of him.

&#x200B;

Also the message of the movie is contradictory. By going to Bonnie's school and giving her the supplies that led to Sporky, it shows that all the other characters were wrong and despite Bonnie thinking she needs Forky, she really needs Woody. However, he just leaves them all.",c2ntqo

Rejean",c2ntqo
eru2yiu,"I'm not sure how to spell his name; it isn't in the list up there. But that was one of my favorite parts in the movie... and one of the saddest. I felt so bad when he was lying on the floor... I just wanted to pat him on the head or something the whole rest of the movie. I've loved Buzz Lightyear since I was tiny, and he'll still be my favorite, but Duke has immediately become one of my other favorites as well.",c2ntqo
ersj4uq,"You're right. But think of where the third leaves off. Woody decides to move on from Andy and stay with his friends under the impression that they can now make a new child happy. Andy even tells Bonnie that woody is very special and to take good care of him.

And what actually happens? The rest of the toys feel cherished by Bonnie who plays with them every day. But what about Woody? He's lost his role as the leader, the ""favorite toy"" and on top of that Bonnie seems to treat every toy with care except for Woody and few others she's no longer interested in.

So Woody leaves with Bo because he can't adjust to his new role. He goes from being Andy's favorite and making Andy happy for presumably over a decade to sitting in the back of a closet. Even with great friends that's a hard adjustment to make.

And that's what this movie is about. Woody realizes that he'll always have friends (Ballad Of the Lonesome Cowboy) but he can't move on from Andy to Bonnie because Bonnie never has and likely never will care for him the way Andy did.",c2ntqo
f32jtpk,"I feel like people make excuses and over analyze TS4's ending as being better then it is to be honest.

It really just seemed to me like a lazy way to try and make another teary ending which was part of all the hype around TS3. 

Forgetting about the sad realities, what happened just wasn't true to Woody's character. The ending that made sense was for him to come to terms with not being the favourite Toy anymore (something that's he battled with from the very start of the franchise because of Buzz) and being a mentor to the Toys.   


A lot of what you said about the ending of TS3 being miserable isn't really true, Andy gave his toys to someone else who needed them and there's no reason that cycle wouldn't repeat when Bonnie gets older.",c2ntqo

But as I said, it's not an oversight, I don't think, it's the direction the saga has taken and it probably needed to in order to be as poignant as it is.

edit: by the way, Bonnie not playing with Woody sort of vindicated my anger at Andy, all these years later, for leaving him behind.

It was focused so much on the Antique shop that the ending snuck on me, and I felt like the ending was a bit too fast. It was like, 1-2 minutes of the emotional ending. There wasn't really a buildup to it because everyone not Woody and Bo Peep were pretty much super super side characters. Avengers, for example, the sad scene where you, the audience soaks it in is 5 minutes long or so.

It was disappointing to see the OG toys get so little limelight, because they were gold every time they were on.",c2ntqo

All this time he was clinging to his kid, but when the kid grew out of toys Woody lost his raison d'etre. He kept on guiding toys because this way he would always be next to another kid. But there is a more noble thing than clinging to one child: being there for children who need you. Bonnie now has forky to guide her through the early socialization stages, and so Woody has fulfilled his purpose as a sheriff - he protected the band and always stuck for each and every toy. It is time he himself moved on. And even though it took him three sequels to finish his own character arc, he finally did.",c2ntqo

et61xnj,"I think the movie made it clear that Gabby was wrong to blackmail Woody into giving his voice box toher. 

In a way, Gabby is the more extreme version of Woody. Woody was willing to break rules to be with his kid. He sneaked into Bonnie's backpack when every toy and human told him not to. 

Forky was the one that forced Woody to witness Gabby's rejection. Woody just wanted to leave the store. Forky, who didn't know Gabby is bad, made Woody stay. 

I think Woody, despite some character flaws, is fundamentally a good character. He empathized with Gabby's desire to be loved by a kid, so that's why he gave his voice box to her (and to save Forky too).",c2ntqo
et7ztia,"I mean, shes not a \*good\*... person? Toy? At least not at that part of her arc, but even when she had Woody cornered and could have taken what she wanted by force she took the time and care to explain \*why\* she needed that box, she took the time to get Woody to emphasize. She didn't have to, there's no way he really could have stopped her, but it was important to her that he give it up voluntarily and on his own terms.

es2dxge,"I recently lost a parent, my mother, and she was very, very important to me. I am having a *lot* of trouble moving on in a world without her. In that aspect, I deeply appreciated the fact that Woody couldn't move on from Andy either. Toy Story 4 validates that sometimes it's OK not to move on, and that it's ok to find coping strategies that work under your own terms, not the terms you were told to believe in.",c2ntqo
es2fsfn,You know what's up..,c2ntqo
es2edb2,"Actually now that I think about it, one of the many hammered things they use is the ""get the car to go back to where they need to be so everything can be fixed"". A lot of things in the film event, action, and humor-wise seemed really ham-fisted to me. I was getting tired of the storyline that was basically three converging stories for Forkie, Woody and Bo, and Gabby Gabby, which didn't really come together that well. Then looking back at the issues with the scriptwriting and the firing of John Lasseter, this sort of all makes sense. The story was a complete mess. I actually like the concept of this sequel being the end of Woody's story vs the last three being Andy's, but in that case they should've focused on Woody and Bo (who was pretty cool and badass), developed that connection more so Woody realizes what he's missing from just being some kid's toy. Then that would make him ""moving-on"" more sensible and poetic since each movie explored a different stage in life: 3 being Andy going to college, and 4 being Woody growing older and wanting marriage/companionship. That sounds like something way more emotional to connect to. At the end of the movie, I didn't really feel about anything strongly.

&#x200B;

The horror aspects I actually appreciated just because I wanted something fresh about this film and in those few instances, it was much better than most of the poorly done slapstick humor. It seemed like 75% of the humor was just slapstick, not much of the old witty dialogue with adult nuances.

It doesn‚Äôt really make sense for woody to stick around.

It‚Äôs him coming to terms with moving from a dad to the retirement stage.",c2ntqo
es3kara,"I think it's just a classic case of people being louder on the internet. Most people will just see this, love it, and move on. For whatever reason, when people dislike something they have to post about it. As I'm going through this though, I see a lot of the complaints are mostly on a surface level. Many aren't seeing the real themes right away, and taking in an understanding that this serves as more of an epilogue for Woody as it does another ensemble sequel like the 2nd and 3rd movies were. IMO, Woody's purpose was always meeting new toys and helping them find a home. He helped Buzz in by putting aside his jealousy and helping him learn what a toy means. He brought in Jessie and Bullseye because he knew every toy deserves a better life than than being in a showcase. He helped the toys at the daycare find a better system than what Lotso had to be enjoyed by growing kids, and gave all of Andy's toys plus himself a new life through Bonnie. In 4 he discovers he's not meant to just be stuck in one home anymore. He was addicted to helping other toys find their place, and so that's what he went on to do.",c2ntqo

Bonnie doesn't care about him anymore, which means if he isn't traded or sold he will have extended stays in that desolate closet for years or a permanent residence in a storage box or landfill.

&#x200B;

Despite his best intentions, his shining years were with Andy but those days aren't returning. As hard as it is for Woody to let go of being the star of a beloved kid's toy show, he must accept the changing of the seasons and move on.

In the beginning of the film, Jessie is seen with the badge Bonnie gave her, so this symbolism gesture Woody did to Jessie at the end makes the most sense because he sees that Jessie can the new round leader of the gang in which we see this during the first post credits scene. And I don't think the badge would be able to cling onto Buzz's plastic spacesuit anyway.

Yes. I saw a recurring theme of ""people becoming redundant to people"" ""letting go of relationships where the other party doesn't find you relevant anymore"". In one of the earliest scenes, the head honcho rag-doll shuts Woody down at every opportunity. Woody has his star taken away and it's given to his side-kick. It's like he's being demoted at work. Then Bonnie seems to discard him in favor of literal trash.  
The way the toys also described their ""kids"" reminded me of how parents might speak of the children they have who have ""moved on"" in life.  
It's as if Woody's going through a mid-life crisis and is realizing that the people he has been loyal to aren't necessarily going to be loyal to him forever. He lets go of his prior concept of relationships and decides to switch careers/retire. He gives up one of his valuable attributes to someone else less experienced so they can launch their own ""career"".

Woody's whole character since 1995 has been that you are there for your owner, period. Only the owner decides when they're done with you. This theme is no more prevalent than Toy Story 3 too, which most consider the best (And most recent before 4) in the series.

&#x200B;

Toy Story 4 is good, but they completely broke over 20 years of Woody's theme for this. But for Disney, they easily created Toy Story 5's plot: The gang goes to find Woody because Bonnie misses Woody as he's ""lost""",c2ntqo

It doesn't help that I watched Toy Story 3 a few days ago, and THAT'S Woody's theme. That you are there for your owner, period. Other toys would get jealous, but Woody would keep them in check and help them. And now that he's not the big shot with Bonnie, he dips.

I don't get why people think Toy Story 5 is a stretch though. The plot is easily there. Creating TS4 was harder. The gang goes to find Woody because Bonnie has a phase where she wants Woody now and she's gone and upset. If they want to do TS5, the plot is easily there, and it would give a shot for more Buzz plot development and more scenes with the OG gang which we didn't get much of. Which was a shame, because those scenes were gold. Rex: ""PANIC IS ATTACKING ME!!""

I just hate that Toy Story 4 broke Woody's character morals that have been set since 1995.

When your entire identity is wrapped up in what you do, who do you become when your work ends? Woody no longer had to look out for a kid, because no one needed him.

The movie tells us Bonnie doesn't need Woody. She doesn't play with him, leaves him in the closet, etc. which is used to justify Woody leaving her at the end.

However, what the rest of the movie shows us contradicts that point. Bonnie did need Woody. Woody was there for her on her first day when no one else was. He helped her get the supplies to make Forky. When Forky was trying to kill himself, Woody explains to him his purpose so he can help Bonnie. When Forky is lost, Woody finds him for her. Without Woody doing all of this, Bonnie would be sad and not even have Forky. She doesn't need to play with Woody but she does need Woody looking out for her.  That is a very clear distinction that needs to be made however, the movie makers missed it entirely.

I never felt like the ending of the third one was a ‚Äúcop-out‚Äù, to me it answered pretty well the what to do when someone stops loving you. You move on, you rely on your family and friends and move on. That‚Äôs a satisfying message to me. This movie repeats that message, only it also tells you to leave your friends you were willing to die with behind as well. Sure it‚Äôs more realistic that way, but now that scene where they hold hands in the garbage or when Andy tells Bonnie how special Woody is and how he will never let her down loses a lot of meaning.

In this movie, Woody is going to live a nomadic life traveling the world with Bo, I guess? Or is he going to be at that carnival forever?

I made this comment before in here, but I‚Äôll just paste it cause I don‚Äôt feel like typing it again:

- Buzz is made out to be a dumbass for no reason just so he has something to do in the story. They clearly didn‚Äôt know what to do with him, but also knew they couldn‚Äôt leave him in the RV the whole time, so they came up with some lame subplot that dumbs down his character.

- The characters that made all the other movies so great are relegated to about 10-15 minutes of screen time and are stuck in an RV the whole movie.

- Woody‚Äôs arc from Toy Story 3 that he needed to learn to let go of Andy and stay with his friends that he cares about is completely abandoned here. He‚Äôs loyal to a fault, but for some reason he decides to leave everyone behind for Bo Peep (which didn‚Äôt feel earned at ALL).

- The new characters got far too much focus. I liked Duke Kaboom, but the little police officer was obnoxious. Key and Peele were funny in parts (even though they literally just play themselves, which is a lazy trope in animated movies that Pixar usually doesn‚Äôt use), but kind of felt out of place with the rest of the movie. And we were supposed to feel bad for Gabby Gabby for some reason, but there wasn‚Äôt any reason for the audience to like her in the first place. Also Ducky and Bunny‚Äôs motivation for ‚Äúwanting to be won by a kid‚Äù is just ignored at the end, like the writers forgot about it.  

- This clearly wasn‚Äôt a story that NEEDED to be told like the people over at Pixar said it was. It was clearly a cash grab, the story felt like an elongated version of one of the shorts with a sentimental ending shoehorned on so it felt like an actual movie.

It‚Äôs not terrible, it‚Äôs just an eh movie, but for Toy Story, that‚Äôs pretty damn disappointing",c2ntqo

eru3a38,"Bo Peep was not likeable to me..at all. She basically ""turns"" Woody. She makes him doubt himself and change, in my opinion for the worse.  She was rude and insensitive to him and he for some reason chose her over ALL of Andy's toys who were still together! I hate that he did that. 

Gabby Gabby was straight up evil and selfish, and then I'm supposed to root for her?? I hated her.

Key and Peele could've been great, but I kept waiting for the hilarious moments that the teasers led me to believe would be there. They didn't live up.

All of Andy's toys took a back seat. Less than 10 lines combined from the main characters. Even Buzz was mostly overlooked.

They tried to rewrite Bo Peeps origin to give her a heartfelt moment by saying she was purchased for Molly to help her sleep when she was afraid of the dark....Bo Peep was in TS1...before Molly had her own room, and she wasnt a lamp... 

Buzz and Woody's separation didn't feel good at ALL. Not sad, not like a setup for a reunion, not by accident. Just a completely unworthy sendoff.

The story itself just decides that Bonnie can just get over losing Woody. She didnt lose him, or give him away, or not want him, they just decide [eh, she'll get over it].

I would've MUCH rather seen buzz and woody (both ""boy"" toys anyway) have been left in the antique shop with a worthy send off and goodbye from the rest of the crew in the backpack before Bonnie comes back in for it, they all have to freeze because someone comes in the front door. and we can hear a womans voice asking for help, looking for something specific. We stay on frozen buzz and Woody's face the whole time and she says ""is that...? Hold on. How much for these? My son used to have two toys just like these when he was little..."" we see them getting picked up and put by the register and it zooms in on what's left of ""ANDY"" faded underneath ""BONNIE."" We know they're the same, but she doesn't. Buzz and woody look at each other and smile as the car pulls away and Andy's mom starts dialing her phone. ""Hey, it's me. You'll never guess what I just found in this old antique store .."" credits.",c2ntqo

Coming from the marathon of the full series(in Emeryville of all towns), it's safe to say that nostalgia & emotions were running high but I'm just glad that this franchise is still around/made it this far.  The humor, interactions & emotion were in line with what's to be expected from a Toy Story film and I couldn't ask for more. I do have a few gripes such as feeling like most secondary characters take a back seat this time around.  It's a bit understandable since this is mostly Woody's story but it felt like some didn't get nearly as much shine compared to previous entries. Don Rickles' absence was certainly felt with Potato Head getting very few lines. Hell, I can't remember much from Slinky either but this is one of the few franchise were every character, no matter how minor the role, plays a crucial piece of this puzzle that make this series what it is.

The fact that she does ‚Äúlittle more‚Äù than that in my opinion makes her extremely two-dimensional. She reads as an attempt to be a strong female lead while in my opinion her character never changes and remains pretty static the whole way through. She isn‚Äôt without power. She‚Äôs just too obvious.

erxuw2j,">Toy Story is about sentimentality, various varieties of platonic love, and the desire to be needed. This movie was all about those things, too. Woody is still obsessed with the sentimentality of his time with Andy, and moves on. Woody has a platonic love for Bonnie that is not entirely reciprocated anymore, and feels lost about it. Forky has become the focus of the platonic love she gives her toys. These combine to mess with Woody's desire to be needed- he makes keeping track of Forky and helping him and Bonnie his entire focus of being, because he feels no longer needed by Bonnie, and this gives him relevance. In the end, he finally breaks away from the sentimentality of thinking about Andy to become a toy that can help

He realizes just because Bonnie's not interested in him anymore doesn't mean nobody will be, and he is allowed to leave her and try to find someone else to make happy, rather than feeling like he's worthless unless he's someones favorite toy for 20 years at a time, simultaneously realizing that his desire to be needed can be fulfilled in other ways, by helping other toys find kids, or by helping random kids like the lost toys do.

And even a hero deserves to have his own happy ending. He deserved to be happy with Bo after all that time, especially after he left her in order to make Andy happy.

Duke definitely could have been overdone had Pixar allocated too much screen time for him.

There was a line in the film about how Woody is pristine and hasn't tarnished at all over the years.

I didn't get why introduce something so heavy such as an inner voice, reduce one of the leading characters to a nothing side joke and then not actually go anywhere with the inner voice aspect -.especially as the lead offers to give his own up.

The inner voice joke wasn't that funny anyway, so it wasn't even worthwhile having.

But I thought Jessie and the gang came all at the same time? I'd get it if it was something where Bonnie was only attached to Woody because it was a free toy or something like that or even if she just grew out of love with Woody because he was a boy's toy, so to speak.

As far as Andy goes, I get that he might be dwelling on the past since he has all this extra time to think about how he got to Bonnie, but the film never really goes into that. Does Woody think he made the wrong choice in choosing to split with Andy in TS3? Has Woody become directionless without Bo? If so, I would've loved a touch there about that.

es1f5y9,"Well to me it just felt like a continuation, using the same beats from the past Pixar films like Inside Out and the other Toy Story films. A toy doesn't see its importance to a child, Woody is jettisoned out of a window to go show the toy it's importance to the child, meets a Toy precieved as evil but really just had a bad owner or was forgotten and it's up to the toys, Lost Toy returns to child after learning importance and precieved evil toy also finds a new home as either karmic retribution or a character change turning them to good means they get to find a toy.

Storywise it's just the same but where the movie shines is it's characters and small moments, when the little girl whose lost and scared sees Gabby who she presumes lost and scared and braves up so they both can find her mommy and daddy felt very real.

erygssq,"Yeah Gabby Gabby showed her true colors when she was willing to give his voicebox back. 

Once I saw her tossed away and just sulking about it, my heart broke for her. 

That's the interesting thing with her. They could have made her a full on villain and had her lash out at Woody. Maybe prevent him from ever reuniting with Bonnie. ""If I cant have the kid I want, nobody can have their kid!"" type of attitude. That would have been the obvious road to go.

Nah. Instead, she just sulks. She doesnt even *care* about revenge. The girl she idolized didnt want her. What else more was there to life?

I felt truly bad for her.",c2ntqo
eryg743,"Good points.  I feel like Woody declining the voice box is more about there not being time for that as they are currently running against the clock trying to make it back to the RV.

And I don't know I think making the point to show that she doesn't connect with the girl at the fair until she pulls the string and hears her voice does put a spotlight on the fact that she can only connect when she is fixed.  I think it would have been more powerful if it was Gabby's broken voice saying it and the little girl could look past that and still love her for trying to comfort her.  In the same way that if most people saw Forky they'd think he was ugly but to Bonnie he means everything because of how he helped her in that moment.

I hope this doesn't sound like the guy on the internet that thinks his idea is better because it's his idea but I wish somehow they could have got Gabby a kid without Woody's voice box.",c2ntqo
eryfjsf,"I think initially Woody willingly gives Gabby the voice box to get back Forky not to appease any desire that Gabby has.  He doesn't even care to stick around to see if she does indeed get her happy life as Forky is the one that calls Woody back to watch the scene with Harmony unfold.  And her attempt to give it back in the moment feels hollow as there is no time for Woody to get it back as they are frantically trying to get back to the RV.  

It just didn't feel Gabby earns any kind of redemption as she stole something from Woody to get what she wanted.  She is merely fortunate that Woody is a kinder person and willing to forgive her.",c2ntqo

It's not just because we grew up with it. I have issues with TS4, but adults didn't just go because of nostalgia. They go because Pixar has a reputation for good storytelling.

""Not giving it too much thought"" is exactly what allows harmful propaganda to fester. This is a form of media that was released by one of the most powerful companies in the world and will reach nearly every end of the earth. I WOULD give it some thought if I were you and make sure you're not being spoon-fed for the sake of remaining neutral and maintaining a positive relationship with Disney. There are a lot of warm & fuzzy feelings involved with growing up watching Disney movies, attending parks, etc. but we have to separate our feelings from critical thinking if we're going to be analytical about media.

And Charles Kinsey, a mental health therapist, who was compliant and communicated to the police that he was unarmed was STILL SHOT even after laying flat on the ground with his hands up while trying to help his patient.

Lotso and Gabby have two big similarities that I can see.

1. They're both the self-appointed overlords of an area in which Woody and friends have to navigate. Lotso acted as prison-warden over the toys in the day-care and Gabby acted as what seemed like a mob boss with her henchmen guarding and assisting her at nearly every moment she's on screen.

2. They both are convinced that the best way to lead a fulfilling life is to be a child's toy. Lotso doesn't express this the way Gabby does, because he was deeply wounded when he was replaced. To cope with the pain, Lotso convinced himself that he didn't need to be a kid's toy and he resents Woody and Co. for having what he lost.

And that leads nicely into their differences.

1. A marked difference is that Gabby and Lotso interact with Woody and friends in very different ways despite their aformentioned similarities. Gabby isn't interested in locking anyone up the way Lotso is. Where Lotso is committed to keeping control over the hierarchy he's managed to sit atop, Gabby simply wants a voicebox because she has convinced herself that her broken voicebox is the one thing keeping her from being satisfied. Once she gets what she wants from Woody, she doesn't try to impede any further. She thinks she's achieved her goal.

2. Although both Gabby and Lotso present a menacing presence that prevents Woody and the others from moving freely through their territory, Gabby still has hope for a fulfilled life. Lotso, on the other hand, has given up. He struggles with his embittered view during the third act, but ultimately he refuses to face his pain and consequently continues to believe that he is better off without a kid. Gabby never does. She sinks into depression and fear after she's rejected, but ultimately she's still willing to acknowledge that what she wants is to be loved by a child.

3. And the biggest difference I can see is in how their stories wrap up. Lotso is given hope and rejects it for fear of being hurt again. Gabby is given what she believes she needs, is still rejected, and then overcomes that rejection to achieve her dream.

There's probably more, but that's what I can remember from having seen it this morning. Hope that elucidates why I and some others think differently.",c2ntqo

When Bo left, he made the choice to stay with Andy because he knew that Andy would be heartbroken without him. We see it right away with Andy running around in the pouring rain looking for him. But this time he realizes that he isn't important to Bonnie. That no matter what he does, he won't ever be hers the way that he was Andy's.

I know one day my daughter won't need me like she does now, and I'm ok with that, but I'm still going to be sad (and proud and worried and excited and scared and and and...) when it happens.",c2ntqo
erwfcik,"For sure! The ""lost"" toys are all happy in this one too, it's the ones who are owned who are stuck (for good or ill)",c2ntqo
erp2lbc,Haha yeah that was a good line. He had one other good one in there I can‚Äôt remember at the moment. But not enough for me!,c2ntqo
erw8xde,Or toy story 5 could leave Bonnie and the crew entirely. Follow Woody and Bo as they discover lost toys and help them find owners/purpose.,c2ntqo
es3p1id,"That's why i'm actually curious what it's like for kids to just watch them in order right after (or between several days or whatever) another, instead of growing with them yourself.",c2ntqo
esdwkdb,"Yeah, same. I graduated HS the day before Toy Story 3 came out so I really felt like I was Andy. The Toy Story films will always have a special place in my heart honestly",c2ntqo
et8hzhv,"Seriously scary how fitting it‚Äôs been. TS3 dropped as I was graduating HS and this comes fresh off of me losing close family members, losing the woman I was certain I‚Äôd marry, and leaving to a new city to start a new career, all while trying to get a better understanding of my own purpose. This one was honestly so relevant and well done.",c2ntqo
esfr8qs,"That's what kids do. For years my kid was way into Cars...cars everything; toys, soundtrack, books, blankets, etc. She still likes Cars but she has basically moved onto Paw Patrol everything. There was no explanation why she switched and left Radiator Springs but that's what naturally happens.

My daughter is the same age as Bonnie so her forgetting about Woody wasn't that far off.",c2ntqo

erzdct3,"And she's going to act the same with Forky in a couple days. There was multiple messages there. To never stay attached to someone that no longer loves you back. And to find joy in being your own person. And probably something to do with helping others ahead of yourself, which is what Woody did with Forky the whole movie.",c2ntqo

erwf4l5,"you could apply the same metaphor to bonnie as representing a world outside the comfort zone of andy. I am not really trying to discount woody's journey in this movie, just saying it is basically the same thing learned from the last movie only bigger. Instead of learning to let go of andy he learns to let go of the idea of having a kid altogether. I did like how he reached a state of transcendence at the very end where he helps other toys find a kid for themselves.",c2ntqo

eryic8u,"Yeah it does play hard with the notion of ""nature vs nurture.""

Would Gabby Gabby have been a kinder person if she was loved growing up? Or would she still be doing cruel things because that's just who she is?

We can ask the same of Woody. Without Buzz, would he have ever developed a realistic  view of himself as a toy or would he have continued to view himself as entitled to be Andy's favorite toy?

We see how far he has come when he doesnt even care about being played with Bonnie. He just wants to feel *useful* in some way.

Buzz' original nature was to believe he was a space ranger. Without meeting Woody, would he have killed himself eventually trying to do impossible things that he thought he could do?

The notion of nature vs nurture is pretty huge in these movies.",c2ntqo
exczvvt,WHAT.,c2ntqo
erov6u4,"In 3, Buzz clearly wasn't confident in what to do as far as staying with Andy or not. Jessie took charge and decided to go to Daycare, and Buzz rolled with it.

Technically Buzz hasn't took charge in over a decade by the events of 4, so with Woody gone he starts questioning his decisions 

I thought his arc was funny and appropriate.",c2ntqo
eru93kh,"I was just thinking about this scene the other day after watching it. Probably a great example of how Buzz can still be intelligent at times.

I didn‚Äôt really see that in this film, except for the fact that some of his seemingly obnoxious plans worked lol",c2ntqo

erow8dk,"It brings a certain tragic irony to the end of Toy Story 3, imagining what if Woody had learned to say goodbye to the gang at the end of 3, setting them up with Bonnie while sticking with Andy.

But then, on the other hand, without knowing what was to come, Woody parting ways with the rest of the gang in 3 easily could have come off as him ditching everyone else to keep Andy to himself.

At least Woody found a happy ending all the same regardless.",c2ntqo
errqq9x,FBI this comment right here,c2ntqo
erqa2t3,Are you serious?,c2ntqo
erqrkus,"I think by now the toys probably understand that their life is one with a lot of tough choices, one where things can change significantly and they can lose friends suddenly. The start of Toy Story 3 shows they've dealt with the loss of a lot of people, and they know it's a fragile situation that depends on whoever they belong to.",c2ntqo

f39ezqx,"Saying it isn‚Äôt true to Woody‚Äôs character completely erases the DEVELOPMENT he went through in the movie. He realized that he is allowed to choose his own happiness and that he‚Äôs done great things for his kid. I think calling them excuses is kind of silly.

Woody wasn‚Äôt needed at Bonnie‚Äôs anymore? So he chose to be happy with Bo. That is actual growth because before then he placed the kid‚Äôs happiness over himself he was in a negative cycle, he grew, it‚Äôs still Woody.",c2ntqo

et9kcrz,[deleted],c2ntqo
es42cp6,"Yeah exactly this definitely felt more like another TV episode than a movie. I just kind of knew from the trailer when they mainly introduced a talking spork I had my reservations. Even then there was potential if Forky was developed more and given more lines that were actually funny but he can‚Äôt be a big side character otherwise. His purpose asides from cheap humor is to literally serve to kick off Woody questioning the purpose of what a toy has to be and the whole antique shop scene and getting back to Bonnie. It should‚Äôve been mainly about Bo and Woody since there‚Äôs the juxtaposition in characters, one‚Äôs a lone wolf enjoying life and the other is loyal no matter to his kid. And then it would end on the note of finding love, which story wise would work really well after Toy Story 3 was about Andy going to college. I think this life lesson theming from movie to movie would‚Äôve been amazing.",c2ntqo
f1zonwp,Nope. He also did it to help Gabby. He felt sorry for her and wanted her to be with a kid.,c2ntqo

erpo59p,After she was rejected and realized it was more than just the voice box.  I think it was when she was thrown into the box by Harmony.,c2ntqo
etmpulb,"tbh Buzz was always naive, they just took it up a notch here cause things like conflict and self-importance were brought into the debate",c2ntqo
erwr4gn,"I interpreted that as Forky being scared and wanting to return to trash because it was warm and safe and the only thing he knew before being forced to change. Sort of a parallel to Bonnie, who was scared and wanting to return home because it was warm and safe before being forced into the new circumstances of kindergarten.",c2ntqo
erxzqnj,"I was wondering that after Woody mentions he was created in the 1950's (which I guess TS2 revealed, but I hadn't thought about for some reason). They all pretty much just keep living until they fall apart I guess?",c2ntqo
etdqii5,"No kidding, my friend. I was like, ‚ÄúOh, he doesn‚Äôt mean Bo...‚Äù and that was like the moment that it was all going to end. And yeah, it is more of a duty to Woody to leave it to Buzz & the rest to be in good hands in order for him to *fee*l he could leave.",c2ntqo
es3a1mi,"I got what you were saying with your first comment. But it just doesn't fit with the movie. Jessie had her kid. And after Emily outgrew her, still literally the only thing she wanted in the entire world was to be loved by a kid again. I get you can pull whatever meaning out of 4 that you want. But I felt they simply broke too far from the world they built with the first 3 that it didn't make sense. I get what they were going for, but as another commentor said, Woody didn't organically get there. His entire character arch was not leading up to this. They tried to undo 3 movies worth of character development in a 5-minute closing scene. It didn't land for me.",c2ntqo
es3qfpi,Yep. 100‚ÑÖ this.,c2ntqo
ert6nyi,"But this goes against the entire TS franchise. What if Buzz stops being played with next? Should he set off on his own adventure? How about Jesse? Is she destined to relive what happened with Emily all over again and be abandoned in a closet/box? I thought Woody would be there for her?


Also, the shorts between 3 and 4 had shown Woody to be well adjusted... this movie is a radical shift from that. I wanted a TS4, but you are right in saying this movie shouldn't exist as it does.",c2ntqo
ertmmwn,I explained the whole thing about why Buzz should have received the star below in my large post if you care to know my point of view. :),c2ntqo

ertqi8g,"I thought the idea was less ""I'm going to have some 'me' time"" and more (or equally) ""I can do more by helping other toys find kids"" than I can by gathering dust in a closet. He's better at passing something on now than at being a real toy.",c2ntqo
ertp3rg,You get it my friend!,c2ntqo
ervnpun,"That‚Äôs an interesting one. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs one to dwell on really as there just isn‚Äôt a real answer to it, and probably by design. 

My headcanon then is that he‚Äôs Andy‚Äôs dads toy. Woody was put into a box when his dad grew out of him. Many years go passed and Woody loses his memory after being alone. Being taken out the box for Andy was a restart in life for him, starting from new. 

Or maybe his father never wrote his name at the bottom of Woody‚Äôs shoes so they never had that proper relationship to talk about, or that Andy‚Äôs father was a sensitive subject and so wouldn‚Äôt ever want to bring it up.

Who knows! Find out in Toy Story 0, the prequel!",c2ntqo

erqn6q5,"After 3, they were with Bonnie. A new kid. A new family. A new adventure and purpose. They have adventures and you see an epilogue in the made for tv movies like the Halloween special. Here you see it was all for nothing. They were better off staying in the basement or sold to the museum. Being broken up in TS2 is unimaginable. Now they want to be split apart because woody doesn't belong. He should have stayed Andys then. Bonnie doesn't have the same connection to toys as Andy did. Now Woody is off with Boe (Cute) but what about the family? Is this a metaphor for Andy getting married and leaving his family? Because going to college did that. It was just unnecessary story. It would have been better if Bonnies story started a new adventure. Not split it and ended it more. It was already over.",c2ntqo
erqptpy,"Obvious caveat here as I haven't seen the movie yet, but I've been saying since the trailers that I would hate it if Pixar went this direction and I'm so disappointed to hear that this is what they've done. Epilogues aren't supposed to go 'hey, so all those values and beliefs that we embedded in this character don't matter anymore!' Woody has *always* been the toy saying that they stick together and that they're there for their kid, first Andy and then Bonnie. This doesn't seem like a natural 'epilogue', it seems like something they come up with as an excuse to make another movie.",c2ntqo
erv24ya,Pixar wants Jessie as the Sherrif lol,c2ntqo
erp2rzt,I think Forky's show isn't a full series however. I think they're 5 minute educational shorts.,c2ntqo
es32e86,"Yeah, you're correct. DID rip out one of his organs. Hot damn, that was dark.

My mom cannot get past that either, that she took Woody's voicebox. She actually felt sorry for LOTSO, but not this creepy Gabby doll.",c2ntqo
etjk8fe,Have you seen the Dinoco gas station? Now that's crazy,c2ntqo
et57qv3,"I mean she's a kid, they go through A LOT of phases. Even teenagers go through plenty and I think all of us can think of something that we used to like but quickly abandoned. She probably thought cowboys were cool at the time because of something she saw/watched. This is different from like Andy, who was so into cowboys that his entire room was covered in it and even then he had a 'Space Ranger' phase. And then by the time he becomes an adult and gets ready to go to college, he realizes his cowboy/space ranger days are over , he could have easily kept Woody for sentimental reasons but that wasn't the decision he made in the end. 

TS4 starts with Bonnie going through a phase, it begins with Forky being the most important toy for her. She probably had another favorite before the main gang showed up too.",c2ntqo
es3qazm,"Logan's a great analogy to TS4, yeah.",c2ntqo
es3z34u,"I was just mildly entertained by TS4, but I see how that is the way the story is unfolding. I am fine with this type of epilogue on Woody, it's just that what is bothering me is that they stilled called it *Toy Story 4*. It implies a direct continuation of the story in the previous film, and removes *Toy Story 3* as the final installment of that saga. 

There's a lot of Toy Story shorts that came out after the last film (and I've greatly enjoyed all of them). They also kind of focuses on certain character after the events of *Toy Story 3* such as what happened to Barbie and Ken. Or one that is entirely focused on Rex's adventures in a bath tub. *Toy Story 4* is kind of like these. (After all, *Logan* didn't have X-Men in its title).

By titling it *Toy Story 4* I kind of imagined it to be the gang of toys once again. I think a different title would fit this story, but I can see how it wouldn't be great marketing wise.",c2ntqo

es423no,"Definitely. I guess my point was more that we were all happy with 3 being the end of Toy Story, but 4 works as a nice ending too.

I would actually expect this is what they go with in five.",c2ntqo
ex2x6r5,Yes but what happened to him in toy story 4? Is he still driving garbage trucks or did he better his life?,c2ntqo
errljzq,"And that goes against Woody's character arc of putting others before himself. He was with the same person for years. As far as Toy Story 3 is concerned, Bonnie was the new chapter. Going against what was established in the previous movie is just bad writing. Woody willingly leaves Andy in Toy Story 3. He is the only one who got to meet Bonnie beforehand and chose to be with her. TS3 also shows Bonnie as a great kid who loves Woody and plays with all her toys. She is fair and puts drawings of ALL of them on her board. Then this movie starts and all of a sudden she doesn't play with Woody, and Woody is all of sudden still hung up on Andy.  Does Woody ever learn to cope with his feelings of missing Andy? No. Woody has control issues and is envious of Dolly. Does he ever learn to accept Dolly or even commend her for being a good leader? Nope. Woody doesn't start a new chapter, he just runs away from his problems and hopes that will fix the problem.",c2ntqo
errkm6p,"That's not what the movie shows though. He does it for Bo and because he didn't like it at Bonnie's. 

The fact that he can't move on from Andy is a huge problem because it undoes his arc from Toy Story 3. He had the choice to go with Andy to college but chose not to because he grew as a character. This movie then comes in and says nope, he didn't. Like now, one would question, would Andy prefer being a lost toy or being with Andy because they undid that chapter now.

All the other movies had closure, even if it was bittersweet, and this one suddenly doesn't see the need to explain or justify character actions.",c2ntqo

etf8gsj,"Just his politics in general (one of the few open conservatives in Hollywood). Plus the way Disney-owned ABC canceled his successful sitcom, I think they were slowly distancing themselves.  I don't know, we'll see what they do with the Toy Story franchise next.",c2ntqo

errt97b,"Somewhat yeah, but the real deal is that when some shyt has really gone downhill, Woody & Buzz can really work together or by themselves to save themselves & their friends from peril.

&#x200B;

For the rare moments, Buzz was helpful but later on, he started relying on the voice buttons to give him options on what to do next instead of his own original ideas.

But then again, we watching Toy Story 4. I'm pretty sure 100% of us weren't expecting a suitable life choice for the whole gang to take. That's why the ""inner voice"" kept popping up. Woody had the same problem in Toy Story 2 but he ultimately decided on what truly matters. The past, the present or the future. He chose the present. You can't go to the past but only towards the future and unfortunately, it has arrived and so its time to embrace the present.",c2ntqo
errz16x,"Very true, that could have used that to make the plot a bit more interesting and moving, I think",c2ntqo
ertmgck,He meant Sid knowing toys are sentient.,c2ntqo
erua3e8,"I took issue with both him and even Woody to a lesser degree. In the original trilogy they both become very adept at figuring out how to tackle seemingly impossible situations. Buzz obviously completely loses that here, but even Woody falls off as soon as they need to start the plot point of Bo Peep being a better survivalist than him-- an arc which I think could have still been included and handled without reducing Woody to someone who acts without thinking.",c2ntqo
ervwcfe,"But he does so in a way that ultimately wouldn't raise any questions. At worst, the mom is a bit confused when Sid's sister goes downstairs, they both end up shrugging it off, everything moves on. Woody takes care to hide before she comes out in the hallway. 

Of course, the film builds to him specifically revealing himself, but again, that's the climax and it's to one specific person for a specific purpose.

I watched them all again this week and although yes, the toys always play it a bit risky, each film gets more and more cavalier.",c2ntqo

erqra34,Funny. I just rewatched them all and liked TS2 better than I originally did!,c2ntqo
errt68u,"Good point. However, although it was one of their original ideas, it was the last of those to be made into film. My speculation is that they were probably trying to figure out how to do it without that element, or were having trouble with it. I mean they did The Incredibles, Rattatouie, and Cars before one of their original ideas, when they had already done the other four. If you look, they didn't make Wall-E (2008) until they were bought out by Disney (2006), at which point they probably didn't care.",c2ntqo
errgw87,"Woody is in a different situation than he was in with Andy, though. They make a point of establishing that he has trouble accepting that Bonnie is different from Andy, and he accepts that by the end of the movie. He meant something to Andy, but he doesn't mean anything to Bonnie. I think that could potentially be enough to make him rethink things, but they didn't build up to it well...

They really could have done a better job of making all of this clearer and building up to it better.

Bonnie is obviously going to outgrow Forky. That's the point. Children change. Since the beginning, Woody has been driven by the knowledge that his child *needs* him. Because for a while that was true. He was lost when Andy stopped playing with him, and thought he could replace Andy with Bonnie. But Bonnie was never going to be a new Andy. She was never going to have the same deep connection with him that Andy did.

The point of Forky was to show, basically, the entropy of toy existence. Forky was a bunch of trash who was given life because a child loved him. He was thrust into a new purpose that he couldn't handle. He was a brand new toy struggling with what that meant. Woody, on the other hand, had been a toy for 60+ years.

Bonnie got Woody first when he ended up at her house when she found him hanging from a tree trying to escape. She then later at the end of the film received all of Andy's toys, including Woody back. Its assumed she used to play with them all but got to liking Jessie more, to the point she made Jessie the Sheriff.   


\> Does Woody think he made the wrong choice in choosing to split with Andy in TS3?   
No and I think that's part of the reason for his choice at the end. He found himself looking after Bonnie because he was treating her as Andy and was doing it, to a degree, for Andy (which is why he hid away when she went to Kindergarten, like he did with Andy). He was forcing himself to be part of the picture where he was no longer needed. (or at least that's what I got out of it).

Woody was a *kind person.* (toy or whatever)

The ultimate message of the film (I believe) is that even though our original 'purpose' may feel lost, we can always find another one.

Gabby Gabby got her second chance with the lost girl at the end.

And Woody finally understands that his second chance doesnt necessarily have to be with Bonnie.

In Toy Story 3, he was very much still in character. Again, being the voice of reason when trying to tell Woody that going back to Andy and the attic would be pointless. The comedy spawning from Buzz came from his Spanish mode.

The rest of the movie makes no sense if its a year later. Forky's character arc of wanting to be with the trash, but then deciding to be Bonnie's ""trash"" doesn't make sense a year later.

He moves onto helping in other ways and being the all-around good guy that he is. He's bringing positivity into many more people's lives now and has personal fulfilment, which was my takeaway. The other toys are still needed by Bonnie and Woody had to grapple with what it was going to mean to be one of the earlier ""cuts"" in the same way Andy's toys were given away or sold (like Bo Peep). It was neat to see a conclusion to this cycle that went a bit further for him, because he IS something special.

I can't think of a single moment Bonnie actively played with Woody and enjoyed it except for the exact moment Andy first gave him to her in Toy Story 3.

You do realize ""Bonie will be okay"" could also just as easily mean that, well, Bonnie will be okay?

So what would the toys do when they're done being played with? Either know they have an option of being a free toy or choose to go into that ""dark place"" that Jessie was once in. But at the moment, it seems that most toys are happy making their owner happy. 

And who knows what the toys are going to do in the future. According to the Disney Timeline Theory, the humans are going to get eradicated. So that leaves the question on how toys will live without humans. What's their purpose in life after human life gets wiped out? We don't know.",c2ntqo

Yes, kids get over toys. However, the first three movies didn't need basic bs like this to tell a movie. They could have had a valid reason. They could have shown why Bonnie singles out Woody, rather than not addressing it at all. Why not have it be that Andy told her to take care of Woody but Bonnie takes it seriously and just doesn't play with Woody because she's afraid she'll ruin him?

YES! My mom will not shut up about how ridiculous it is. She respects *Toy Story* in general, loves Woody and Buzz and Andy, and knows how much I adore the first 2 movies. But also keeps saying, **""It really is stupid, when you think about it, crying over a fork...""** and **""I can't believe I went to see a movie about a plastic fork...""** and **""She woulda broken it in a week anyway, my goodness. Let him live in the trash....""** and **""Woody shoulda just let him go, he was really coddling her \[Bonnie\], kids lose things...""** and on and on.

I was watching silly meme videos about the original movie on youtube yesterday, and it got me thinking that Woody really HAS become pretty coddling of children. I wonder if the Woody of TS4 would have the balls to scare the shit out of Sid like he did in TS1. Maybe he would've said, ""Nevermind, this is mean."" I know Bonnie is a sweet girl and nothing like Sid, but still. So she was afraid to start kindergarten. Lots of kids are. Doesn't mean you gotta travel across state to find her trash craft. If Woody really wanted to help her (and I think it's really nice that he did), he should have done something to lead her to another *student*, help her make friends with a real child. SOCIALIZE.

Forky is funny and cute, I don't hate him personally as a character, but Bonnie's *obsession* with Forky is leaving me a little bitter, though that could be because we're supposed to believe that he's replaced Woody as her favorite ""toy"" now, and I mean...come on. Really?",c2ntqo

Not to mention Woody went through YEARS of being stuck in a toy box with Andy and was loyal the entire time.

You're the one assuming ""Bonnie will be okay"" means she won't be upset in the tiniest bit. They never show how upset Bonnie would or wouldn't have been. But that has nothing to do with Woody's entire character development that identifies his sole reason for being is to be there for his kid.

And she didn't notice any of the other toys missing either. She was obsessed with Forky. I mean, by Woody's standards, all of the other toys were ""abandoned"" too since they went the whole trip without being played with while Forky was her favorite. Guess they all should have run away too?",c2ntqo

I think the movie explained the mom shoves the toys into the closet whenever she is in a rush. 

How is this moronic Buzz going to support Jesse exactly? 

With this Bonnie, Forky will probably end up in the trash within the week. That's the thing about Jesse, she might be able to overcome her trauma temporarily but the toys that need help need help right away usually.

Granted I kinda agree with you on their treatment of Buzz. He was almost reduced to comic relief but I get it because his arc was basically complete in that he was cool with being Bonnie's toy in a way that Woody could not. This was Woody's story. 


Of course people get overhyped about movies that are just opening. It's par for the course, especially if it's a story that's been built up for 24 years.
