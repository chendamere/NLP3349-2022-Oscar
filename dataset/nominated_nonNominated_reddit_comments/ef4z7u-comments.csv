fcm6at4,"This movie needs a Bob Odenkirk trigger warning.  When he just hops into the film all of a sudden about an hour and a half into it, it's a bit jarring.  My wife and I couldn't stop laughing at his mere presence, let alone the mutton chops.",ef4z7u
fc1deqm,Beth was so weird and sweet. I loved her. It was great that she had a personality outside of being “The Sick One.”,ef4z7u
fc1hnl8,Loved the theme of money and ownership in regards to women. Loved how Greta Gerwig blended Louisa May Alcott’s own story into the film. Alcott never married. The film’s end showed that it was the ownership of her own book that truly fulfilled her. One of my favs of the year.,ef4z7u
fcdtqzi,"Just commenting to say that “12 year old” Florence Pugh in Dutch braids surrounded by actual other 12 year olds made me laugh out loud at the ridiculous contrast. Other than that and Chamalamalamalet clearly not aging through the whole movie, i really enjoyed it.

Edit: I also missed the instructive and helpful marmee portrayed by Susan Sarandon. I worship Laura Dern, but I’m not convinced that she really did justice to the character. 

One scene of her saying she was “ashamed of her country” isn’t really comparable to “If you feel your value lies in being merely decorative, I fear that someday you might find yourself believing that’s all that you really are. Time erodes all such beauty, but what it cannot diminish is the wonderful workings of your mind: Your humor, your kindness, and your moral courage. These are the things I cherish so in you. I so wish I could give my girls a more just world. But I know you’ll make it a better place.”",ef4z7u
fctl52u,"I loved the whole movie but I have to say one of my all time favorite scenes I've ever seen on the big screen was the ""gentlemen's club"" scene where they are dressed as older men with the pipes. Genuinely hilarious and love that Laurie was hiding the whole time.",ef4z7u
fc3ml9i,The reveal that Bob Odenkirk plays their father is the fastest I’ve ever gone from crying to losing my shit in a movie.,ef4z7u
fc3i9nh,"I think the most memorable scene of the movie for me is Amy's economical factor in choosing a husband monologue inside the painting workshop. It was a single take where the camera focuses and tracks with Pugh's face as she moves toward Laurie. The controlled delivery says so much, it adds a silent subtext to what was spoken. It conveys a woman in a time where it is un-lady-like to burst out how she really feels, yet the measured tone tells us so much more is hidden beneath the surface. Furthermore, her perfect articulation of the matter hints her intellect and how often she thinks about this unfair world, refining each time she is reminded that life, fate, and society have constantly placed her being second to someone else whether in being a sister of talent, a love interest, an artist, and a woman.

Edit: grammar and clarity",ef4z7u
fc1cr24,The hard cut from Amy confessing that she loved Laurie to her 7 years prior sending him a mold of her feet is pretty much my entire dating life.,ef4z7u
fc1cw8t,THAT scene between Saoirse and Timothee was stunning. Thought the whole film was excellent but that scene...damn,ef4z7u
fc1gosb,"The ending was so meta with Jo writing a happily ever after for her protagonist, parallel with Louisa May Alcott being forced to write a romantic ending for her novel. ""Under the Umbrella"" is even the name of the last chapter in ""Little Women"", if my memory is correct. The flashbacks were a little confusing. Also, I was not convinced that Laurie was in love with Amy. He really wanted to be part of the March family and he was going to do so in any way he could.",ef4z7u
fc1i7f2,saoirse is fucking fire damn she can act.,ef4z7u
fc1kgqr,Holy crap a movie with over five A-List actors that is a solid film. I enjoyed it. Greta managed to turn a 500+ page book into a solid two and some change length movie.,ef4z7u
fc1dpcy,"I love this movie so much. Just the kind of film you want to live in. I’ve seen it twice now and both times I found someone new to grab onto and follow emotionally. The first time I was fully into Jo’s journey, but the second time I was way more attuned to Amy (and also more cognizant of Beth). I can’t wait to go again and have another completely new experience (I also can’t wait to see this with an actual audience). 

Also, while the contrasting Christmas scenes absolutely destroyed me (the hold on Jo’s face is perfect), it hurt a lot more when Mr. Laurence is hovering outside his own mansion, afraid to go inside because he knows Beth won’t be there, and Jo offering to help go inside with him. This film does so well at carrying over what I liked most about Lady Bird: making me care about the side characters almost as much as the main characters.",ef4z7u

fc523jt,"I’m a little confused by the meta ending. 

It’s frustrating because I personally love Friedrich Bhaer’s character in the book because I believe he propels Jo to become a writer of passion rather than just profit.

**But** what exactly does Jo and Friedrich’s ending imply in this adaptation? 😕",ef4z7u
fc1dkxa,Non-linear structure was a fresh way to engage with this story.  Such a great choice.,ef4z7u
fc1gngb,LADY BIRD WAS NOT A FLUKE.,ef4z7u
fc22fk1,"My poor 15 year old brother liked the movie much more than I believed he would, but he just told me he didn’t realize the story was non-linear.  I asked, and he didn’t question how Beth had died in one scene and then moments later she was talking to her sisters.  He DEFINITELY didn’t pick up on the changing color palettes, bless his heart.

Other than my brother’s absent-mindedness, (I am in no way blaming the movie for his entire lack of awareness) I truly loved this movie. Certainly one of my favorites this year.",ef4z7u
fc1dylf,Absolutely perfect reimagining by Greta Gerwig. The way she brings Amy into her own is so impressive. Took her from my most hated character to a sympathetic one,ef4z7u
fc487t4,Loved it! Am I the only one who hadn't read the book and came out thinking Beth was the youngest of the four though?,ef4z7u
fc1f3j6,Totally random but I couldn't stop thinking how Emma Watson's American accent has improved so much since Perks of Being a Wallflower!,ef4z7u
fc1heja,"Just a delightful movie all around. The cast had such great chemistry — the four core sisters in particular. I was a little jarred by the bouncing back and forth in time on this first viewing, but I think the effect was great by the end. 

Now gotta go read the book.",ef4z7u
fc220ll,"Overall, I think this is the best adaption of Alcott’s novel but it was jarring to see the story being told out of chronological order.  I arrived two minutes late and believed that I had walked into the wrong screening halfway through the film. 

Saoirse earned an Oscar nom if not a win. 

Florence is an excellent actress but the scenes where she played young Amy were surreal. The scene where she’s  in class with actual 11 year old girls was jarring. She just looked like a 20+ year old woman with the mind of a child. It was such a strange choice not to do double casting like the 1990s version.",ef4z7u
fc2btys,"Now, these little women. How little are they? I mean, are they, like, scary little?",ef4z7u
fc1nwb8,"This is Florence Pugh’s year and this movie just reaffirms that. She’s so phenomenal as Amy — a character who should be entirely a brat, but also loves deeply and has incredible independence of her own.

I particularly loved the ending, where Jo is talking to the publisher and they discuss the ending of her book. It’s so meta, but also romantic (both in the classical sense and emotional sense.) Jo realizes that she can be who she wants and be with who she wants to be with without detriment to her story.",ef4z7u
fc4xfbp,"Really enjoyed the movie, but the only thing that pulled me out of the immersion was the discovery Beths passing, I know they wanted to mirror the first time she was sick but there’s no way the family found out, grieved, and removed the body  all while jo was sleeping in a chair off to the side",ef4z7u
fc6wyi6,"It's unprecedented how extraordinary films like this both exist and make you feel. I'm a mid-20's male and I connected so deeply with Jo's character, how she didn't want anyone to be ""taken"" from her, how she wanted more to ""be loved"" than to love, and how her hobbies trumped her social/love life. Fuck, man.

I was drowning in my emotions for most of it.

I've said this before and it applies here more than ever and always will: Florence Pugh is immaculate. She stole every scene she was in. People are talking about the Saoirse+Timothee scene, but BOTH Florence+Timothee scenes (inside the paint shop and outside when she confesses to him) were *incredible*.

Also, fuck the obnoxious woman in my theater who screamed ""WHAT?!"" when Amy admitted she had always loved Laurie, and then later screamed ""NOOOO!"" when they kissed.",ef4z7u

fcxy3yz,[deleted],ef4z7u
fc1h3vn,I think this film touched my heart like no other movie this year and I think that’s because it’s just a genuine love story. I adored Florence Pugh’s performance as Amy and think Saoirse Ronan absolutely killed it as Jo. Absolutely one of my favorites of the year.,ef4z7u
fevyl7d,"Just saw this today and I’m torn. While it looked gorgeous and featured some truly phenomenal performances, I think Greta Gerwig made a few artistic choices that prevented this adaptation from reaching its full potential.


1) The first act felt very disjointed. This might’ve been because it took me awhile to adjust to the nonlinear narrative, but I also felt that scenes within the same timeline transitioned from one to another jarringly and without any sense of flow. 


2) Bob Odenkirk and (to a lesser degree) Laura Dern felt miscast, which took me out of the movie.


3) Gerwig should’ve chosen older actresses to play Florence Pugh’s classmates in the schoolhouse scene, because the obvious disparity between Pugh and the literal children surrounding her looked ridiculous.


4) Dern declaring that she hated her country came out of nowhere. In fact, I feel like that whole scene could’ve been cut out.


5) Meryl Streep’s character felt underdeveloped.


6) I just don’t buy Timothee Chalamet being as old as his character seemed to be by the end of the film.


7) Beth’s death scene was powerful, but I don’t understand how Beth could’ve died and been taken from her room without Ronan waking up at her bedside.


All things considered, I deeply enjoyed this film, I wish I enjoyed it more than I did, if that makes any sense.",ef4z7u
fc44ew4,[deleted],ef4z7u
fcspqgv,"I thought the plot twist of them all being regular sized women was bold, but worked.",ef4z7u
fc21ms2,"The thing that separates Greta Gerwig movies from other similar movies is the care she puts into every person. In both this and Lady Bird, the details she gives to minor, relatively unimportant characters are what makes the film (like the conversation between the publisher and his wife, or the scene at the end with Mr. Laurence and Jo)",ef4z7u
fc1d45k,"I don't normally go for period films or classic literature, it's just not typically something I would go see, but I loved this movie. The film is funny and heartbreaking. The cast is fire. Saoirse Ronan could read the ingredients off a cereal box and make it engaging. Florence Pugh is also quickly becoming a must-see for me. Definitely in my top five for the year.",ef4z7u
fc1jgmi,"I am a bit torn about the ending. I appreciate the creativity that went into mixing Alcott’s real life with the movie - but I wanted to see the actual Jo-Bhaer trajectory than the “fake” scene we got. 
Each scene was done and acted beautifully, but I felt that having a non linear timeline reduced the emotional impact that comes from continuity. (Jo-Laurie proposal, Beth’s death). Florence Pugh was great as Amy.",ef4z7u
fc1d85g,So good. Glad to see Gerwig didn’t just stumble into a perfect story for her with Lady Bird. Doing a classic period piece like this really helps legitimize her as a director and writer. So excited to see what she’s got ahead of her,ef4z7u
fc5znb4,"I adored it and had a lot of thoughts, which I've shared on social media, but I did have one thought that I really can't share on any platform where I'm identifiable...


Louis Garrel as the Professor had an incredibly strong cunnilingus energy. I have never thought this about anyone in my life, ever, but as soon as he appeared on the screen my brain immediately said: ""oh yeah, he'd go down on you"". Maybe that's why so many people have been saying they are finally ok about Jo ending up with him?",ef4z7u
fc1hhh2,"Emma Watson finally in another good movie? 

After all this time.",ef4z7u
fcwegp6,"I don’t know if this has been asked, but does anybody know why when Friedrich Bhaer, Mr. Dashwood, and Jo we’re all writing letters they talked straight to the camera? I found those parts a bit jarring.

Also, upon second and third viewings a couple of little things stood out:

1. Jo was ambidextrous (you see her switch hands in a couple of scenes when she is writing, I thought that was a nice little touch)
2. Right before Beth dies when her and Jo are lying in bed you can hear the waves go out (earlier at the sea Beth talks about how she is like a wave, she goes out slowly but will go out—or something to that sentiment)
3. Marmie is wearing the same outfit when Beth dies and gets better (not sure what this represents, maybe nostalgia and always remembering your parents the same way?)

ETA: Just found out through an [interview](https://youtu.be/Z-4Ahn6lV-Y) (starts at 16:30) that Greta was inspired by filmmaker François Truffaut and that she got the letter reading idea from his film Two English Girls.",ef4z7u
fjz3xri,"Emma Watson was great here, and anyone who was viewing this fairly could see that. She literally got the character perfectly and was perfectly on par with the rest of the cast and had great chemistry with them. The only reason anyone singles her out is because they never liked her to begin with, and just see her as a punching bag, especially considering who she's surrounded by here.

A lot of people just have a bone to pick with her, and were never gonna give her a real shot to begin with. A lot of people were just gonna dislike her and say she was bad in this no matter how well she. She did a great job in this, and anyone looking past their preconceptions on her and the hivemind could see that. The actual reviews that clearly were looking at it fairly and not just because of their past bias against her as an actor gave actual good reason why she was great in this, and detailed how well she got the character and the warmth she lent to the character, but there are a few people that just hate on her no matter what and just see her as an obvious target of ridicule here.",ef4z7u
fc4m9zv,Chalamet is either going to be the greatest actor of his generation or he’s going to die in 3 years. I really don’t see any other outcome. The choices he makes in this are just mind blowing. Like how the fuck do you emote that much without moving your face at all. It’s just wow,ef4z7u
fc7cybf,"Controversial maybe, but I enjoyed the flashback setup. To me, it was a way to relearn the classic story. I found myself more invested in their childhood due to the fact that you could actually see how it affected their adult life. There was the “Daisy” scene for Meg right as she and John have the argument about finances because she’s still struggling with putting up appearances, and this, to me at least, really emphasized that their childhood wasn’t just there for nostalgia, but as reminders of who they are at their core. 

Beth killed me with her one liners. Florence Pugh was a wonderful Amy, the scene with her and Laurie in which he tells her not to marry her intended match was gut wrenching. 

I appreciate the nod to Alcott’s life, but as somebody who loved the ‘94 version and romance, it was not only jarring, but a bit disappointing. I did like the straight on shots, wish it had been done with more characters so it was less jarring when it did happen.",ef4z7u
fchpze6,"One of the most interesting scenes in this movie was Laurie’s proposal. TC and SR really knocked it out of the park. Laurie and Jo were both fighting for their friendships in different ways during changing times. Laurie wanted to seal their friendship together as a couple. Jo naively wanted their friendship to always remain the same. Laurie’s last line was heart breaking and all too relatable. Yet what made this scene so incredible was the wooded New England hills and the golden sunset sky. I think it’s genius to complement the two together in this way. The warmth that it gave to something so heart wrenching adds a layer of subversion to it. It’s sad, but it’s beautiful and even majestic. Yet, the setting of the sun conveys an end of an era. This turning point decision not only impacted their lives personally, but as we can see, it also reached into the lives of everyone else they’re related to.

Jo lingering afterward was all of us. I don’t think anyone of us wanted their childhood to end.",ef4z7u
fc4aegp,"I adored this adaptation. I was a little confused at the beginning, but I think the movie found it's rhythm when the childhood plotline started. I just really love how familial the cast was with each other. I loved how they wrestled, argued, played, and laughed together like a true family. And >!my heart freaking broke when they mirrored Jo waking up in the present by Beth's bedside, only to go downstairs and find her mom sobbing!<

And I think they did a pretty good job turning Florence Pugh from 12 to 20. When the time went back-and-forth I kept trying to figure out what kind of makeup trick they were doing to make her go from youthful to lady.",ef4z7u
fdal8r1,"I really loved it, though I wish I had known Bob Odenkirk was the father. I'm too used to him comedically and him suddenly appearing took me slightly out of an otherwise moving scene.",ef4z7u
fc1lksd,"Loved this. The ending is genius. The ensemble are terrific. Techs great. Greta is such an exciting filmmaker.

My favorite performances were Ronan and Chalamet. His best performance since he broke out, not to be underestimated as just the charming love interest.",ef4z7u
fc3f0sc,"I love Emma Watson as a person, but I don’t think she’s much of a natural actor. Especially next to Ronan and Pugh, she just doesn’t bring the same level of talent.


Edit: Oh, god. What have I done.",ef4z7u
fc1czxp,"The only thing I’m not sure of is whether or not the flashbacks suit this story or not. I didn’t hate that aspect of it, I just don’t know if it was necessary (though I will say that showing Amy saying she loves him, and then cutting to her making a mould of her foot for him as a kid is perfect).

My biggest issue with the story has always been that I don’t particularly like Jo and I *love* Amy, and so I was really happy with Florence Pugh as Amy in this. I’m always like, go back to Amy, show us her again! And I just really liked her performance. Timothée’s as well. Emma Watson was better than I thought she would be. 

I really enjoyed it, honestly. I really liked it. The showing I went to this afternoon was sold out (so were a few others across the city) and got a round of applause at the end, so! I think people will like it.

fefvvlc,"All the comments in the thread make me feel like I read a different Little Women from everyone else.

I always felt Laurie’s love for Amy was genuine and the transition from being miserable about Jo to falling for Amy was organic. Yet everyone here is like “he doesn’t actually love her he still loves Jo”. Not a surprise that I can’t find anyone who felt the same about the added relationship triangle (?) either. I loved that in the book Jo shot Laurie down and never looked back. She could feel lonely - it’s perfectly natural - but the professor should be the one she thought about, which could also make her happy ending better. And I don’t really like Amy being a lovesick kid. She’s always been my favourite and I loved how stern and even cold she could be. Amy never showed romantic interest towards Laurie as a little girl. I’d prefer her conflict coming from always wanting to be included but being left out by Jo. She and Laurie falling in love by changing each other for the better, one about not marrying for money and one about contributing to society, was my favourite part of the book, but now it’s just background.",ef4z7u
fntsnsx,"Amy’s character, tho, needs to grow from being a spoiled child to a young woman and when you have two different actresses portray her you see her become a young a woman and you realize she’s no longer a child. Pugh being a 24 year old woman playing a 12 year old little girl is just very uncomfy to see",ef4z7u
fc96pxg,Chalamet gave a good performance as Laurie but he was distractingly thin. I mean if the “camera adds 10 lbs” he must be positively gaunt in real life. I hope it’s just his body type and his rising stardom isn’t causing other problems in his life. I thought it was just me but my husband mentioned it.,ef4z7u
fhgmezn,"Watched it today and having seen the 1994 version and the 2017 Masterpiece miniseries, I can definitely say this one's my favorite! I loved the way Laurie and Amy's relationship actually evolved, and the fact that it didn't just happen out of nowhere like in the other versions.

I also think that leaving Jo's and Professor Bhaer's fate open ended so that the viewer could decide if she actually married him (or if it was just the ending she had to give her book) was very smart. It actually made sense, given the fact that Jo had been very adamant about being a wife and giving up her freedom.",ef4z7u
fhylu8d,Laurie was an ass.  Not sure why Amy would marry him instead of Fred.,ef4z7u
fc1jt7j,"The perfect adaptation doesn't exis... Enter Greta Gerwig! 

I finished the novel in 3 days right before seeing this film. And what can I say? It's a masterfully adapted script! The non-linear structure shouldn't work for this story but it really did under the direction of Greta. And the emotional impact is maximized. Holy shit did the tears stream down my cheeks multiple times throughout the film. 

Oh, and the girls are wonderfully acted. The four actresses are perfectly cast. They really brought Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy to life. 

What a fantastic film! I love it so much!",ef4z7u
fc1hp7f,"Wow, the actors all gave stellar performances. Standout was of course Saoirse Ronan. The relationship between the sisters, especially the conflicts throughout the years between Jo and Amy really made me emotional! Even though the sisters would hurt each other with their actions and etc, the sisterly love triumphs it all. The whole theater was sniffling! 

One of my questions leaving the film was, did Laurie really love Amy? And I think the conclusion I came to was that it might be the dilemma that Jo was going through when she wanted Laurie back. The idea that wanting to be loved and being in love are not the same.  I think Laurie was lonely and wanted to be loved, similar to Jo. And Amy was able to provide that for him. 

Jo’s change between the way she was with Laurie vs. Frederick also showed she was in love, she found her happy ending (: 

Very well told story, and would engage viewers that have never read the novel as well!",ef4z7u

foijyfa,"I am very disappointed in this version of the movie. Probably because I came of age watching the 1994 version.

I think it was miscast. It's hard to tell the age difference between the sisters, they literally all look the same age. This is especially an issue with Amy- the actress who plays her basically seems the same age as the other 3 girls, but I think she's supposed to be like 12.

I feel like key moments in the film that felt SO dramatic and raw and emotional in the 1994 film just didn't have the same oomph in this version.

The jumps from past to present are confusing.

I know this is part of the book, but it feels weird for Laurie and Amy to get together.

I also don't remember if this was similar in the 1994 version, but it feels like a pretty damn charmed world considering a lot of the narrative supposedly takes place while THE COUNTRY IS AT WAR.

Overall, really not a fan.",ef4z7u
fcwmuw2,"Am I the only one who didnt find Laurie (timothee) character to be that likeable?  He just seemed to want a lot which in a film that kept talking about how little women (no pun) get in the world in comparison, made him seem even a bit more greedy.  If not one sister, then another.

4. Felt more grounded in the time period


Better in 2019

- Amy (I no longer hate her for getting what should have been jo’s)
- Aunt March

Debatable:
1. Laurie

foj0gt7,"Just watched this movie, and it's the first time I've ever experienced the story of Little Women.

Overall it was quite well made (the production designer was definitely the true hero), but the whole thing lives and dies on Florence Pugh's Amy IMHO. As a child she's so jarring and distracting, but then as an adult she absolutely steals the show and elevates it to something of a standout in the genre.

I think Gerwig's biggest weakness is in underdeveloping young Amy and old Meg, and thus creating what feels like a slightly imbalanced narrative on both sides of the timeskip.",ef4z7u

I'm not sure about Chalamet as Laurie. He's got very impressive screen presence and he's a good physical actor but he's not warm enough for Laurie. They were going for androgyny, so he works in that sense, but that's not how I picture Laurie. I don't picture Christian Bale either, so I'm not sure who I'd cast. Someone too old to play Gilbert Blythe, probably. 

The nonlinear timeline was necessary for the Under the Umbrella sequence to work, so I get it, but I thought it hamstrung some of the emotional beats. To have Laurie screaming at Jo he loves her then kissing adult Amy in the next scene didn't work. 

I liked the scene where married Laurie and Jo talk alone in the attic, that was a really nice inclusion compared to 1994.",ef4z7u

fnthbza,"It strays too far away from the source material. Jo while being the main character, feels over shadowed by Amy. Amy is described as someone who is rude, materialistic, and able to advance within society not because she is honest, but it is because she understand people and acts how she believes they want her to. She isn’t a bad person by any means, but this movie feels like a redemption story for Amy more than a true portrayal of the classic novel. Furthermore the story between her and Laurie is romanticized, it’s stated that while he falls in love with her eventually, he decides to propose because if he can’t have one sister, he’ll be happy with another. The actress playing Amy does so beautifully, but she is definitely not 12 or 16 the age the character is in the book. That leads me to Jo who seems weak in the movie. She isn’t a strong headed and confident as she is in the novel. This is seen with the letter she writes to Laurie and her reaction to the marriage. She’s happy for him in the book, excited that her best friend is now her brother. In the movie it looks as if she was about to cry. Don’t get me wrong the movie is beautiful to watch, but it feels like a completely different story.",ef4z7u

They all lived vastly different lives and all held different world views through out. However, what brought them together was, of course, their love of family. This was beautifully shown throughout the film. 

Now to more technical aspects. The writing was sublime. Some lines hit with a firmness and eloquence that is reminiscent of actors on the stage. Humor was sprinkled with the same care that the heart ache was. They lived in parallel. This is obviously evident because of the two time lines, but this also bled into individual conversations and scenes. 

The acting was terrific. Lauren Durn has really become a big time actress since Renata on “Big Little Lies.” Timothy played his role, however it was Florence Pugh who blew me away. Every scene she lead was masterclass and left me feeling either elated or gutted. Bravo. 

The two parallel scenes of Jo waking up and going to the kitchen was genius and really the crown jewel of the film. As well, Meg talking with her husband at the table served as one of the more real scenes. She chose a life that was not filled with glamour so that she could be with someone she truly loved. That sacrifice was a major theme and that scene encapsulated it. Overall this movie deserves a lot of love, and perhaps with a more sensitive academy could take home some big awards.",ef4z7u
fgnfg57,This is the first movie that made me cry in A LONG TIME. Not even sure why. I'm not a crier. It's not like it's THAT much sadder than other flicks that I've seen. Guess there's just something that struck a cord with me here.,ef4z7u
fhzyubm,"I wonder what would’ve happened if the ending stayed true to what really happened to Alcott and Jo never got married. Would people have hated the ending?

fdnsdwr,"just saw this last night, i have never seen the older versions or read the book (yet) so this was my introduction into this story and the characters. there's a few things i wish were done differently:

I love Flourence Pugh and think she was a good Amy but i wish they hired a younger actress for the scenes were she was supposed to be 12. My friend who read the book went to see this with me and had to tell me that Amy was supposed to be the younger sister, or else i wouldnt have known. She genuinely looks older than Jo and her acting like a 12 year old just didn't feel right.

maybe this one is just because i havent read the book yet but i wasnt a fan of the non linear time line, it was super confusing and i felt like it made the story less emotional. 

other than that i really really liked the movie and now im going to watch the 90's version and read the book!",ef4z7u
fds8c1e,"35yo (Chinese-American) female. Saw this twice. I've never read the book, but I grew up watching the '94 version and cherish it. I was really hyped to see this movie because the acting seemed amazing and the clips showed some really powerful scenes. After the first viewing, I honestly felt a little let down. It seemed the best parts (""Women..they have minds!"" ""Marriage IS an economic proposition,"" ""I love you, Jo!"") were what was already shown in the trailers, and especially the Laurie proposal scene felt like it went from zero to yelling really fast. There were some slow parts where I think the minutes could have been used to extend the sisters' stories. I agree also with some people that young Amy looked and sounded too old for the character, but other than that, the all the acting was wonderful. I thought each sister's character arc was given good development. I could relate to each one of these women. I had no problem tracking with the non-linear storyline.

BUT my biggest regret is that Friedrich Bhaer and Jo's relationship wasn't developed more. The last personal conversation they had together was in NY and ended with her rejecting his friendship because he hurt her feelings. The movie just needed ONE more line from him at that point - something as simple as, ""Write what's important to you,"" or ""write from your heart..."". The '94 version enriched their friendship wonderfully with that impactful scene where Jo asked Bhaer's opinion and he gave an honest one, but also encouraged her to do better because he knows she could. This spirit of support was missing from Gerwig's movie and prevented me from cheering them on in the end when Jo chases after him. I wasn't convinced the ""love"" was based on anything substantial due to the loss of opportunity to grow their relationship this movie doesn't take.

As for the ambiguous ending, I say, why can't Jo have her cake and eat it too? The inheritance of the house was real...and Jo did say she planned to start a school with it, as well as write a novel about her life. So, why couldn't it be both? Start a school AND get a book published, AND be dating Prof. Bhaer (not necessarily married)? No, Jo doesn't need to be married to be successful/fulfilled, but if there's a guy who loves and supports and inspires her, why not get married? She's allowed to change her mind. That is life.  I think her tearful conversation with Marmee about being so lonely shows that she's understanding that as she gets older and things around her change, she must also grow and change. 

Upon a second viewing (just today), after having a week to process the movie and think through my issues with it, I have to say I enjoyed it very much. I mean, I enjoyed it the first time too. It was an artsy, unique take on the story, with many zinger lines and scenes, and though I think the '94 version is still more enjoyable over all, I could watch this version more than a few times too. There's so much to take in and analyze, and FEEL in this precious story of the four March sisters. Bonus comment: One of my favorite scenes is after the 3 remaining sisters leave Aunt March's empty house, talking about what makes the human experience important - is it that writing about something makes it important, or that the thing is already important and writing about it validates its importance? (I think it's both). The reality that Beth is gone is palpable in this scene, but it was such a sweet minute of connecting between the now grown-up sisters who've gone through so much together. Extra bonus: ""Life is too short to stay angry at your sisters."" Perfect line.",ef4z7u

Again, it's unfair to hold her to such a high standard for a career, but I genuinely feel she will live up.

That being said, I loved it. Loved how it was filmed, loved the cast and the writing. 

I noticed the color grading differences between the childhood scenes and the adult scenes and honestly initially just thought it was to show how drab adulthood was compared to childhood. But towards the end when the only adult scenes with the warmer coloring were the fake train station scene and the picnic with the family I thought maybe I was thinking of it backwards. Maybe the warmer childhood scenes were meant to highlight how flawed our memories of our childhoods actually are when looked at through nostalgic glasses. Like I said, haven’t read the book so I don’t know if this is a common interpretation, but I thought it was pretty cool.",ef4z7u

ffzceke,"Saying this as a 24 year old male with no sisters or platonic female friends, after seeing this film last night, I wish I was a girl with 3 sisters who had their childhood. It looked so manic and fun with the plays they'd put on and the dynamic each of them had in the film. 

It felt like watching Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood where it was just a great time at the cinema, enjoying seeing the characters getting fleshed out as it progresses, instead of a plot per se. I think my favourite scene was when Jo and Laurie dance outside the house party, couldn't keep a grin off my face.

Saiorse Ronan is just such a talent, I'll watch anything she's in now. Florence's Amy was a delight as well, even if she was the worst of the four for burning Jo's book. I loved how she looked up to Jo for her approval in a few scenes, first putting on a steely exterior and when Jo says it's okay she cries with joy. Emma was fine here but she had the least to do. And whilst Beth's story was sad I didn't find myself moved by her death. I'm not sure if it was because we just had the fake out scene right before or the fact we didn't see her body/scene of her not waking up when shaken. I think it would be a 10/10 film if I had cried there. And Timothee, what a handsome, brilliant actor. He was perfect in the role and had the best costumes (and hair). 

Am I right in thinking that when Amy tells Laurie she's not marrying Fred that he resigns himself to marry her and that he was being a shit telling her not marry him prior? I feel like he still wanted Jo. And am I right in thinking that Jo didn't love Laurie, she was just upset that he had been taken from her? Also I think it was bullshit when everyone is telling Jo to go after Frederick and Amy says she's never seen her happier - how about any time she's with Laurie?!

Overall an amazing film, it's a travesty that Gerwig didn't get a best director nomination for this. The music was sublime, as was the cinematography. Also I must say, 6.6% is daylight robbery... 9/10.",ef4z7u
fc5m8ft,"Here's some dramatic irony I never noticed about Little Women before.

Laurie loves Jo. Jo rejects Laurie because she doesn't love him the same way. Later, when Jo is questioning whether she rejected him too hastily, she tells her mom that it doesn't matter that she doesn't love Laurie romantically; she just wants to be loved by someone. 

However, what she doesn't realize is the newly-formed relationship between Laurie and Amy. Amy romantically loves Laurie, ever since she was a little girl making foot imprints for him and drawing his portrait.  Laurie has always decently liked Amy. Of course, we all know they get married.

In the scene where Laurie reveals to Jo that he married Amy, she asks if he loves her. It couldn't be more obvious that the answer is not an enthusiastic yes. He hasn't fallen head-over-heels for Amy. He likes her, but more importantly, he always wanted to be a March, envious of how close and loving the family is, something he never had. Jo rejected him, Meg was never an option, Beth was dead. Amy was a fine settle. 

Laurie married Amy, not because he loves her passionately, but because he wanted to be loved. He knew she loved him.

Dramatic irony: When it's too late, Jo considers marrying Laurie so she can feel loved. While in turn, Laurie had already married Amy so he can feel loved.",ef4z7u
fd1tr11,"This was my first exposure to the story and I loved it. I’ll now see just about anything that Florence Pugh is in after seeing her in Midsommar and this. Beautifully acted. I loved all of the scenes with the four sisters interacting. The scene with Laurie joining their club had me rolling. Almost ugly cried when Beth died. 

Bob Odenkirk threw me off quite a bit because I’m watching Better Call Saul right now and just finished Breaking Bad, but that’s not the movie’s fault.

My only other qualms were in editing, which isn’t something that I usually notice, since I’m no film student or anything like that. It’s also possible that maybe they were logistical errors in the particular showing at my theater, I’m not sure. Examples: stock cat noise when Jo brings the cat in (we know it’s a cat, we don’t need a very standard meow sound to confirm its catness), one scene where the camera was holding on Jo near the end of the movie ended in a frozen still for about a half second, the conversation with Meg and John where he says to get the dress and she says that she sold the fabric already had a slight audio/video lag, the scene where Amy hugs Laurie seemed to have Amy’s lines including post-production as I didn’t notice any facial muscles move during the lines.

fcjr2wc,"**About Jo and Friedrich**

I generally liked the movie, but I’m *so* tired of some people believing that romantic subplots make a heroine “weak.” 

I didn’t like the way Gerwig meshed Louisa May Alcott and Jo’s stories in this adaptation. I’m tired of people overlooking Friedrich Bhaer’s role in Jo’s story and simply viewing him as the shoe-horned romantic interest. 

In the book, he’s the *one* person who took Jo’s writing and talents seriously. He challenged her and influenced her to think ambitiously about a passionate writing career instead of the soulless sensationalist stories she wrote to support herself and her family. 

Some believe that Friedrich was actually based on famous Transcendentalist thinkers who were good friends with the Alcotts in Massachusetts (like Emerson and Thoreau). I can believe that, given his intellectualism, soft-spoken charm, and tender masculinity.  

As others already wrote, it’s not like Alcott *had* to pair Jo off in the end. But, she did. To someone who **valued** her ambition and talent and viewed her as an **intellectual equal.** At a time when Jo became increasingly lonely and isolated because her family was moving on with their lives. *What’s so wrong with that?* 

I’m frustrated that Jo and Friedrich’s dynamic isn’t really ever viewed this way. And, most of the time it’s simply pushed aside as it is in Gerwig’s adaptation. 

Louis Garrel did a great job with what he was given, but it would have been interesting to see more buildup between Jo and Friedrich’s intellectual connection. (I even wrote a whole damn essay on that aspect of the dynamic.)

I hope we will get that adaptation someday, but this isn’t it.",ef4z7u
fc1e4s9,"I can see why Greta Gerwig wanted to adapt this for the umpteenth time. She did a magnificent job for the most part, it felt fresh and urgent and deeply moving, even funny when it wanted to be. Also, Saoirse Ronan is officially the best actress of her generation. What an amazing performance! ...Yet again.

My one big complaint is the constant flashback and forths. I suspect Gerwig used this technique to distinguish it from previous adaptations, but half the time it added nothing but mild confusion, and even when it did ""work,"" it didn't feel necessary. I also think it undercut the romance between Jo and Laurie.

Speaking of constant flashbacks, I think Togo is one of the few movies in recent memory that used them correctly. We already know that the unruly pup will be Leonhard's top dog, so there's no drama in showing his life chronologically. Better to flash back to his puppy days during their journey to show us just how far he's come.",ef4z7u

In this movie we're told the lesson ""loving and wanting to be loved aren't the same thing"" and then five minutes later it feels like they both just settle for eachother?

I don't know, the connection just didn't feel believable for me and I understand it's based on a true story so it's what happened but I wish we got to see that relationship developed a bit more.

fem81js,"Went into this blind, not knowing anything about it. Ended up really liking it, which I expected to given the Oscar nominations and the fact that I like historic ""period piece"" movies. The acting was really top notch, but that goes without saying. I wasn't confused by the switching timelines, as the color palette made it clear along with context.

I think what was great about this, is that the characters felt so real. Often in historical pieces, the characters are so different- which was often a sign of the times- but it made them seem quite far away. This movie retained the feel and vibe of the 1800's but it was so relatable- the most relatable historical movie I've seen. And not just because of the message, but because of how the family/friends interacted with each other. 

I also really loved the end, as Jo does get a man, but it's painted as complex. You don't just sit there and roll your eyes because it was just a happy romance. Although it was a happy ending, Jo worked and faced a lot of struggles that women today face- wanting to be successful and having goals/ambitions but still wanting to be loved, and have a more ""traditional"" love story in that sense.",ef4z7u

I think the non linear story telling strangely adds to the rewatch ability because you remember scenes and how they relate to each other but they can go right after each other (Amy saying she’s always loved him cut to her making a mold of her foot) or separated by a long time like Jo waking up when Beth is sick

It's probably the most delightful movie to watch with your family that feels timeless about growing up, the economics of life decisions, and following your heart whether it's love or a profession. Gotta admit when Jo went to chase after the french dude in the rain, it almost lost me with how romcom it felt, but damnit it was the most satisfying thing to see Jo find someone.",ef4z7u
fd9m11o,"Not sure how I feel about this one, especially after rewatching the 1994 version which has lots of strong elements.

Cutting up the story in two and jumping back and forth just didn’t work for me and undermined several key story points (like knowing Jo rejects Teddy in the first 10 minutes).  Older versions (and the book) allow the characters to grow and develop so you feel something when they start making big decisions, I thought the time jumps added nothing if not confusion (sometimes didn’t know when I was until a minute into a scene.)

The casting in this film was really bizarre, obviously more about star power than the right actors.  Emma Watson was actually kind of bad (and unbelievable as the eldest) while Florence Pugh looks and sounds as old as the rest.  Maybe casting a child who grows into Florence like previous versions would’ve worked better.  Timothee has the opposite problem, playing the younger self well but hardly believable as a grown up man now bitter about the past.  Having said that, I’ll watch Chris Cooper/Meryl Streep in anything.

Liked the “twist” ending but think it would’ve worked even better if it had followed the format of the novel and allowed Jo room to fall for the German tutor/be changed by his introduction of urban intellectualism into her life.  THEN surprise us by rejecting him.  In this version he’s almost a nobody.

I think this is an American Hustle type situation where a lot of the buzz is because this is a back to back film from a rising voice, but might not be that remembered in years to come.",ef4z7u

Then became some sort of vessel of moving emotions through until the end. Either laughed or cried the whole time. 

I don't have anything specific to build on from the plot at the moment except that as a 20-something working woman, out on her own and away from her family really trying to make something for myself, I felt united with a grander female experience and am really appreciative of that.

Personally, after that speech, I would've liked a little more of an ambiguous ending to if Jo ended up with Bhaer or not. That scene of all of them celebrating Marmie's birthday seems to confirm that yes, she did catch him at the train station, but a cooler ending would've been if you don't see Bhaer at all, but instead end it with Jo turning to the camera and smiling at somebody, leaving it up to the audience if she sees Bhaer or someone else.",ef4z7u

fqej4ey,"In my opinion... this movie was really not good.

And it could've been great! They had all the right ingredients (actors, money etc.) But Greta Gerwig dropped the ball on this. Barely any time was given to flesh out the main characters. Meg was quite bland, TIMOTHEE AS LAURIE WAS COMPLETELY IGNORED AND GIVEN NOTHING TO WORK WITH. Marmee was made a one-dimensional character. MR. MARCH, WHO IS A CENTRAL PART OF THE STORY WAS GIVEN ONE SCENE and it was completely unbelievable when everyone acted all excited to see him after he came back FROM WAR because the girls barely talking about him in scenes prior.  
There was no sense of or atmosphere of their town as well. Concord (I believe?) is a charming place and a character of its own and there were barely any shots showing A TOWN

And don't even get me started on the terrible inaccuracy of the outfits and hair. If you're going to set a story in the Civil War era, you need to dress the characters historically. Otherwise, it takes you completely out of the story. I swear, all four sisters were wearing dresses from different time periods or modern interpretations of dresses from the 1860s.  
Also, I understand they were all progressive for their time but the scene in Laurie's grandfather's house where the sisters all squabble and yell over each and Marmee just goes ""My girls have a mind of their own"". Well...  
1. Even in modern times, teenage girls would not yell at each other in a stranger's home they just met. I know it was meant to show how close they were and ""sisterly"" but it was over the top and unrealistic, especially when you consider the time period.  
2. It did nothing to show us who the characters were. And was annoying.  
3. Real Marmee would've told those girls to be polite and shut up.

Good parts:  
There were a few good monologues from Jo. I like the one in the attic with Marmee.  
Amy was great. But her romance to Laurie was not believable because THEY DIDN'T GIVE ENOUGH TIME TO SHOW THE CHARACTER OF LAURIE

I just don't think the switching up of the chronology worked in this movie's favor. There was really no reason to do it except that it made this version of Little Women ""different"". But because of it, emotional investment in the characters and character development was completely lost. It was too ambitious for a two hour movie. Maybe it could've worked if it was a short series (like the much better 2017 version of Little Women. Seriously check it out, it's amazing!).",ef4z7u

The acting was great, the depiction of the era was pretty good too. However the time jumps - I was completely lost until about the end. I couldn't keep track of what was when and what was going on. I couldn't get a handle on how long Beth (was it Beth?) was sick with Scarlett Fever. Was it years? I don't understand how that works because nothing was linear.

feiw9qt,"Just got back from seeing this.  It was beautiful and well acted and overall very, very good... but as someone COMPLETELY new to the story of Little Women I feel that my appreciation of the movie was hampered by constantly questioning when events had occurred.

Some of my favorite films have multiple intertwining timelines, and I appreciate that Greta Gerwig didn't do too much hand-holding when it came to the timeline jumps, but I've never been so unsure of a movie's timeline.

Not helping things was the weird absences of both parents, but mainly the father.  Odenkirk was there in some scenes when the girls were young, and some scenes where the girls were older, but mainly not present.  He was introduced so late in the film that I had figured that he was off at war during all of the 'young' scenes... or possibly that he had been killed in the war and would not be present in the 'adult' scenes.  You find out this isn't the case around the time that Beth is dying - but because of this weird misdirection, I was convinced that Beth recovered from scarlet fever just in time for Christmas and the big reunion of the family only to die *the next morning*.  I sat there thinking, 'that was some incredibly clunky editing' only to have my wife explain to me later that Beth's recovery was years prior to her getting sick again and dying.

To make matters worse, you have four actresses that are already too old to play their characters at their *oldest* ages.  To have 25 - 29 year-olds playing characters at age 12 without any real effort to make them look older or younger in the different scenes is... confusing at best.  Hints like Jo's different hair length is helpful, but only if it's consistent throughout, and this is only introduced 2/3rds of the way through the film.  And aren't the events happening over a period of time, separated by \~7 years?  I can't say for sure but I feel even the hair length was a 'red herring' in determining the timeline - normally this would be inconsequential, but not in this case when one is expected to be looking for 'clues' at the beginning of a scene to determine when it's happening.

I thought the nonlinearity was spectacular - so seamless, elegantly executed, with so much trust in the audience to pick up on it without really blatant cues. That's something that can I think only really be pulled off on screen; it would be too hard to be that subtle on a page.

My only complaint, as someone not really familiar with the source material, is that there are a *lot* of plot strands to burn through. It made the film feel a little long to me in the back half.",ef4z7u

1. The acting (Saiorse and Timothee in particular).
2. The character development. The characters feel really alive, fleshed out and likable.
3. I liked the non-linear story-telling. It really hit me.

My major problem is how the character arcs end. I feel like it pretty much fumbles all of them. Just seems like there are importance missing scenes.  They all lack moments that demonstrate their growth and justify their endings. Like Meg’s arc is pretty much just three scenes and has no middle. Amy has a huge scene where she demonstrates her independence and refuses to be a backup plan for Laurie... and then the next scene reverses course with no explanation. And then we don’t really get much of an ending for Jo despite being the main character. She writes the book, we get the fake ending, they tell us it’s the fake ending and then we don’t really get a real ending that explains why she’s happy now. The themes just don’t really get tied up.

ffud5bb,"Okay first of all they made Baer hot?

Second of all these adaptations are all so similar. Burning Meg's hair. Meeting Laurie at the party. Giving away their Christmas breakfast. Hiding Laurie in the attic. Meg's ball. Amy getting into trouble at school. Jo not taking Amy to the play and Amy burning Jo's book. Amy falling in the frozen pond. It all plays out exactly the same. Gerwig could have never read the book and only watched the movies. It's eerily similar. I guess it could be because they are all very faithful to the book?

Meryl Streep killed it as Aunt March. She disappeared into the role like she became an American Maggie Smith. Thimoty Chalamet could play anything so he was fine as lonesome Laurie and lovelorn Laurie and debauchery Laurie. Amy's always been my favorite, but Florence Pugh wasn't Amy to me. The economic proposition line was weird like a revisionist woke view.

And then Jo...  Saoirse Ronan made her too pretty and feminine. Jo is supposed to have the mannerisms of a boy. I'm not sure how an actor can convey that, but she should have an androgynous vibe. I'm fine with Jo regretting her choice to turn down Laurie because it adds drama, but if you're going to commit to regret, I say just go all in and make her say she loves him. But Jo saying she wants to open a school so girls have somewhere to learn, that's just too much. Jo specifically opened a school for boys. Because she wanted to raise other boys like Laurie, because he was like her brother, that's what she wanted. It's also why she's happy that he marries Amy. Because he's her brother and having him in the family is the best outcome.",ef4z7u

fpf7iha,"So I finally watched the movie and I'd like to share my opinion, even if it might be unpopular. I really, really did not like it. So many things are wrong with it. 

Let's start with Amy. Oh my god, do I even need to say it. When a girl who is supposed to be 12 in the early parts of the book looks older than all of her sisters and sounds like an adult woman with a low, slightly hoarse voice, that just doesn't work. She doesn't seem to show any emotions other then sulking and disapproving, her apology to Jo after she burns the book is so far from sencere that I wouldn't forgive her even after the near drowning. She looks out of place at school and she's just not a good fit to play young Amy. Maybe if she was at least voiced by a different actress in her young years that would not sound so off-putting, but as it is I winced every time she spoke in the ""past"" bits of the film. 

Jo. Why is she nearly blond?? Jo is supposed to be brown haired. Otherwise not terrible.

Why does Meg look younger than all of her sisters other than Beth? She's supposed to be the oldest... She definitely doesn't give a sense of a girl who is trying to act like an older sister. Generally her character wasn't developed at all, I wouldn't see anything more than a pretty girl in the film character if I haven't read the book and didn't know what she's supposed to be. Very flat, shallow portrayal of a character. 

Mrs March, I didn't like her at all either. She didn't give the impression of a warm, calm, cosy and strong mother of a family. She just looks like a hectic, slightly hysterical woman. And ginger for some reason... 

I was disappointed with the portrayal of the scene of Beth's illness. For me, in the book this is one of the most powerful moments, when they wait, at night, when the doctor said that if she makes it through the night, she'll live... Laurie's sudden announcement that their mother is coming, that he sent for her. The tension of the wait, Laurie disappearing to fetch their mother, the dawn, the arrival of their mother, Beth finally sleeping peacefully. It always gave me goosebumps. Here they just brushed over it... Blended it into the story of Beth's death. 

I didn't like the patchiness of jumping back and forward in time. I didn't like the casting for the most part. The ending takes away some of the atmosphere by being too obvious and too dramatic. Overall, this is definitely not my thing... 

From the good/ok parts - Laurie was ok, Meryl Streep is amazing as always but there isn't a lot of her so it doesn't save the film. The atmosphere of the time was recreated well, beautiful costumes, nice music.",ef4z7u
ff3za4z,"I haven't watched the older adaptation. But I loved this movie. One of the opening shots were she's running back home with the 20 dollars was really nice. My favourite was the scene at the beach just before the sister dies. I love what she did with the story too, the back and forth pacing was really good.",ef4z7u
ff6daar,"I'm just now noticing this, but there are several shots of the door closing on Bhaer in the film. It seems to be symbolism. Gerwig has basically closed the door on he and Jo's storyline together in this adaptation.

Also, while Gerwig's creation of the Jo pursues Laurie subplot does connect more to modern times, I wish that she had focused more on Jo and Bhaer. Even though Alcott created the professor to sell books and it is by no means a natural match, it's in no way instalovey. It's actually well-executed.

Don't get me wrong. I love the film's ending. I think between Beth's death and her marriage to Bhaer, Jo's character underwent significant changes in the series (not entirely for the better). It just might have made more of a statement to show that even after everything that they had been through, Jo still chose to remain single.",ef4z7u
ffkdp8t,"As someone who’s never seen the other adaptations or read the book I absolutely loved this

fcfvkws,"I loved that unlike most adaptations As good as they are  it was about Little WOMEN plural not just Jo and her other sisters. Every sister had an arc and something to do. It wasn’t just the Jo show even though she is the main character. They were all well cast and the chemistry felt so genuine the interactions felt like actual sisters. 

I’ve always loved Amy even as a kid I thought her burning Jo’s book while cruel was so badass as well. I understand why she is unpopular with fans of the story my but her faults are also what make her so compelling she is a constant contradiction vain and self centred but also observant and warm and kind when she wants to be especially as a woman. Florence Pugh is a revelation in the role and I’m so glad her take on Amy is being appreciated by fans. I also find it fascinating  that the scene that is getting the most circulation is not a Jo scene but the scene with Amy and Laurie where she has her speech about what it means to a woman in the century. 

I think the studio will/should be pushing Florence Pugh for Best Actress in A Supporting Role. And Greta Gerwig for Best Director and/or Best Adapted Screenplay. The structure going back and forth in time works well and I never felt confused.

It also felt like the Laurie relationship was the most developed it has ever been. You can see from the get go why Jo and Laurie wouldn’t work. She never treats him as anything less than a brother. Everytime he tries to get closer to her she visibly gets uncomfortable. Amy and Laurie are a positioned as an adult relationship. He speaks to her maturely and I did get a sense of attraction/sexual tension in their scenes together. I also really like that Meg has more to do.",ef4z7u
fdeh2qn,"Never read the book but as someone who watches a lot of old movies, I have seen every movie version of it so I guess I knew the basic story pretty well going in.

It was pretty good and it really 'refreshes' the material by jumping back and forth in time.

SPOILERS

It was a smart thing to hold off on Laurie confessing his love to jo near the end, as this is the emotional heart of the story - and plays a crucial part in inspiring her to write the book (at this point in her life she has just lost her sister and lost him  - and the book is getting some of her own agency back).

I will say though, although I think Chalmant was good casting for Laurie, I wish he had 'deepened' his voice to sound more like an adult in his Paris/post-Paris scenes - it would have made his change of heart about which sister to choose make more sense.

My biggest questions about the film was adding the 'meta' element of having Jo's 'happy ending' with Bhaer be a fantasy as a means to get a better deal on selling the book.

On the surface I like the idea - but it sent me back to the wiki page on the real life of Louisa May Alcott and from that saw that Little Women  is not strictly 'autobiographical' and much (the romance with Laurie for example) is fantasy. Also, in contrast to the movie, in real life Alcott's publisher kept bugging her to write a kids book. 

In other words, much of what the film  presents as 'reality' is just another layer of fantasy projected upon the book. Its weird.

END OF SPOILER

For all the admirable things about it and interesting choices, I don't think the film entirely 'works'. Probably the Winona Ryder version is most successful as a whole, though I can't say I entirely love it either because the material is just not 100% up my alley.",ef4z7u
ffhef99,"Not to sound like a total asshole but it blows me away that people have a hard time with the chronology of this movie.  There are super stark differences in the color palette (or tone, or whatever you want to call it) to indicate if a scene is in the past or present.  Like, a talented director intentionally relied solely on the color difference, so of course she's going to make it \*drastic\*, which she did.  It's one of these things where I think the blame on any confusion is solely on the viewer.  With some movies' plot, they don't hold your hand, and I think the same expectation should apply here.  If you didn't get it, that's on you.  It was DRASTIC.",ef4z7u
fc6mayl,"The movie conveys something like an Ishiguro\* tragedy with the life of Jo. All the sisters lost something, but they gained something from their losses also. The time jumps were most effective when it juxtaposes their ideals of their past and their hardships in the present. This is especially true for Jo. Though Jo strived for self-realization (hence, independence), what was most important to her is her family. Jo cared and did so much to try to keep her family together. We can see it all throughout the film: The guilt that she felt for hating Amy. Selling her hair to pay for Mammy's ticket to see her ill father. How much she did for Beth during both her illnesses. How she pleaded Meg to remain. Rejection of Laurie's proposal (though that has more layers to it). Even in New York, she was writing and working so that she can help support the family. Still, life kept taking things away from her. Jo really wanted everything to stay the same most of all, but one by one, each of her sisters moved on. Meg marrying. Amy leaving. Laurie's proposal and her rejection ended practically their friendship. And eventually, losing Beth. No matter how hard much money she saved and how much stories she wrote for Beth, her death was inevitable. What was full in the beginning became more and more empty. 

She had no other options but to move forward, being thrust by fate. She chose the only path given to her but holding tightly her comforting past. Then when Beth passed, Jo, in her most grievous and vulnerable moment, admitted all that she was striving for, her ambition and the freedom to pursue her dreams, she voiced out her unfulfillment, how unfair it is to be a woman, and how much that aches. Beyond that, though, she felt more and more alone due to the loss of all her relationships. She wished to reverse her decision and wanted to choose love instead, but she already made her choice and paid the price. The unread letter, her last attempt to retreat to her past, torn and washed away. It was too late. Laurie moved on, something that she thought she wanted. There's nothing left but to write and to seal her heart and soul into the last tribute to Beth and to finish her ambition. Little Women became both a nostalgic memorial of all her treasured and fond memories of her sisterhood and a bridge toward her ambitious future. In the end, Jo embraced her newly bound book as her lover, as her child, or perhaps, as her family.

ffwwxk2,"At the very least, this should win Best Adapted Screenplay.  Gerwig manages to do something inventive with a classic story while still staying reasonably true to the source material.

But I still prefer the 1994 version.  To be fair, that is the version I grew up on.  I like both the 1994 and 2018 versions of Jo, Meg, Beth, and Marmee, but I prefer the 1994 Laurie.  I think Amy works best when she is played by two different actresses.  At the beginning of the story, Meg is 18, Jo is 16, Beth is 14, and Amy is 12.  Having a woman in her 20s play young Amy always feels off.  I think Katherine Hepburn is the best Jo, I think as a tomboy New Englander she has the closest natural vibe to Jo.

I understand the choice to make Behr a fictional figure in Jo's life as a single woman, but I don't entirely love it.  As a tween, I found Behr boing and wanted Jo with Laurie.  But as an adult, I think Laurie's fun, but Behr is the guy you can depend on and that's partly why Alcott ends the story with him.  The whole plotline of Jo's school partly comes from the fact that Behr is raising his young nephews after his sister's death.  There are two books after Little Women about Jo as a schoolmistress and mother. 

I think the 1994 version does a better job of explaining who everyone is and the 2019 version is probably harder to follow if you're not familiar with the story.  Mr. March is a chaplain with the Union Army in the Civil War, so he is not around for the first half of the story.  The family is so broke that when Mr. March is hospitalized, they literally can't afford a train ticket to DC for Marmee.  Jo is sent to ask Aunt March for the money, but sells her hair instead.  Laurie had a weird European childhood we never see, but he is stuck with his uptight grandpa and his tutor for the first half of the story so he is desperate for friends.  Laurie is also pretty spoiled and selfish, he doesn't understand why Jo is so envious that he gets to go to college.  Both Meg and Jo are working to help support the family as teenagers, Jo is Aunt March's paid companion and Meg is a governess (a private teacher for young children, John is a college prep tutor).  Beth has severe social anxiety and is homeschooled by Jo because she can't handle school, after she gets Scarlett Fever Beth develops heart problems that contribute to her house boundness and eventually kill her.  

Louisa May Alcott's real house (Orchard House) is a museum in Massachusetts.  Apparently the house isn't suitable for filming so both the 1994 and the 2019 version built fake Orchard Houses.  The house you briefly see Meg living in with her children is the real Fruitlands, a commune the Alcott were a part of that is now a museum.",ef4z7u

I absolutely loved this film. All the characters are perfectly cast and fully developed to the point I truly cared about the decisions they were making and the reprecussions for doing so. The cast is so powerful it's actually pretty easy to forget that Merlyn bloody Streep is in the film.

My only slight gripe was the sudden time shifts very early on in the film. But once I got my head around it (and picked up on the colour palette changes) it flowed pretty seemlessly. That's more of a me error than a movie error I think.

fe8jjbu,"I just saw this yesterday with much crying the theater(mine included). As I have already talked others into a stupor, I figured I'd poor my thoughts out here and hope they are interesting enough to others to at least glance at.

\-I can't say if I liked or disliked this movie. I thought the idea of moving back and forth through different times makes sense in light of the fact that the book is laid out almost like stand alone vignettes, but I do think it lost something. You really don't get to see the relationship building and just how close the sisters are to one another and how much Laurie is integrated into their lives as with linear story telling. I think it may have suffered a bit for that. I think we miss how close they are to one another.

\-Getting the information that Jo has refused Laurie so early in the film was an interesting choice. For those familiar with the story, it's no big deal, but for someone who isn't, I'm not sure how it worked. It may cause some to look for the parts with love, or it may mean that you never look at their relationship as one that could develop toward love.

\-I did enjoy the way Timothee Chalamet played the little scenes that communicate his love for Jo:                                                                        
When they meet at the ball and she is describing Meg and he said ""beautiful"" he is actually looking at Jo. I think he may also have smelled her hair, but I could be very wrong(and that is possibly more creepy).                                                                                                               
The way he hugs her when Marmee is going to their father.                                                                                                                                  
The roughhousing on the beach that just screamed the way a boy gets a girl to pay attention along with his someone will sweep you away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
The whole ring thing when Meg was leaving for Sallie's(and the fact that he is still wearing it in Paris).                                                     
The way he follows her with his eyes the whole time in his house after Amy arrives from being hit.         

\-I just don't buy Laurie and Amy(though I never have). At least they set her up as being in love with him all along, I guess? But it just seems super contrived.                       

\-The proposal made me so sad. He is just desperate. It's like he didn't think she would say no and so didn't really prep anything, or he didn't even think he was going to say it there and then and it just came out. It seems like the words are just coming out too fast, and if he can just make her see how perfect they are together, she will say yes, but it's not going the way it did in his head and he just more and more mixed up along the way.

\-The scene in the attic after he comes back married was just bad. No adaptation has gotten this right in my eyes, but, in the book, you get the sense that Jo is happy to have her friend back and doesn't mind that he and Amy are together. It is a joyful and genuinely happy reunion. In the movie, i couldn't help but think Laurie is thinking, ""I went off and married Amy, SO THERE!"" Like he will spend his life trying to show Jo how happy he is with Amy and that is the only reason he married her. He was so sad over Jo, and Amy was there, so sure, why not marry?!           I just never get that one, and this was particularly bad. Especially when Behr shows up and Laurie just keeps asking who he is. The way he does it just makes me think he is thinking, ""wait, why did I do this, I should have just stayed away.""

\-The LETTER, OMG, THE LETTER. I just can't with that. This was the thing that broke my heart the most and made me angry in retrospect. Jo writing him a letter saying she was wrong to say no was just awful in light of seeing him married.                                                                                 
I know some have said she just did it to be loved, but she is super evasive in her conversation with Marmee about her feelings, which makes me think there is something more there.                                                                                                                                                         
We also at that point are seeing a slightly older Jo who has been through things. I think our conception of love changes as we get older and so, it could be that she decided that what she thought love was meant to be, or her want of being alone was no longer applicable, and she saw Laurie as a good choice for a nice life with someone she genuinely cared about, though I still think it was meant to mean that she was actually in love with him. When she goes back and destroys the letter, and then has that brief flashback, it just was so heart wrenching.                                               
I guess the whole concept of the letter. for whatever the reason(I know there are many theories), just makes me unhappy. I always want Jo to end up with Laurie, but I also understand that she didn't feel that way about him and wanted her independence. This movie was supposed to be a new take on this with an ambiguous ending so I feel like the letter wasn't at all needed. She could have been happy to see Teddy and have her friend back, but instead we are left thinking that Jo is desperately unhappy without a husband which I thought was the opposite of what the director wanted.

\-I like to think that she didn't go after Behr. I feel like that was just the book being played out as it was too over the top to make sense. Also, and this may be overthinking, the publisher wanted more chapters quickly, and the ending at Plumfield shows Amy and Laurie with a baby which would mean some amount of time passed.

\-I always really felt that if he had waited a few years to propose, Jo would have said yes to Laurie. I talked about it above, but I think her ideas of love would change and she would feel like he was a good match. Or, if he had proposed, but left and come back years later, again, it may have swayed her. Our concept of what we think we want from love and what we need from it are different and, I think, become clearer over time. I know that's sacrilege to purists, and maybe it's just my wants, but I do believe that.

I commend anyone who has read to the end. The story of Little Women is just so iconic, and it's interesting that such an incredibly enduring story doesn't really have an ending that seems to satisfy most anyone. As I have gotten older, I can better appreciate Jo not being with Laurie, but I really wish this adaptation wouldn't have seemingly gone back on that idea with the letter.",ef4z7u
fc7g0tx,"I thought this was as perfect a movie as a movie can be. Everything - the cast (especially Chalamet, Ronan, and Pugh, as most people have been saying), score, cinematography, costumes, coloring...all of it worked together so well. An astonishing accomplishment and a film that I think will become a classic. I’ve never read the book or seen other adaptations, but I was completely blown away by this one.

The only thing that kind of threw me was all the time jumping, but I eventually got used to it. Really hoping this gets nominated for (and wins) a lot of Oscars.",ef4z7u
ff03sfv,"I thought this movie was fantastic. One of the best films I have seen this year.

Confused that people had a hard time differentiating between the timelines. I have no previous relationship to little women and thought it was pretty clear. They also used different tones between the two timelines with more warm colors in the childhood scenes and a lot of emphasis on blue in the later scenes. I didn’t have a hard time at all.

I did have one question though, how is Aunt March related to them? Is she a great aunt and how was she so rich, is this ever explained in the book?",ef4z7u
fgvq65j,The time manipulation/ cutting between timelines was very Nolan-esque.,ef4z7u
fcwr5ty,"I have no history with the source material and have never seen any of the film adaptations. I was lukewarm on Lady Bird, so I went into the movie apprehensive... had seen the rave reviews so expected to just ""like"" it. I LOVE this movie.

Saoirse Ronan is phenomenal. I had just seen Brooklyn for the first time recently, and  I am all aboard the fan-club train for her. I thought Timothy Chalamet was very good as well, probably the first time his performance has clicked with me. While I found him to be a bit of an ass and jerk at times, it was overall still very endearing.

I thought the themes of this movie were really powerful, even as a 28M. The bit with Florence Pugh about the economics of marriage was stunning. I really loved how in the trailer they had Jo say these lines about how ""Women are more than than beautiful, they have minds and hearts"", and didn't give away the last part about ""So why am I so LONELY??"". That line hit so hard.

My one nitpick with the movie was the couple of times when someone talked right into the camera. It was a choice that didn't work for me, found it a distracting and took me out of the movie.

A lot of people are talking about the cuts between present-day and flashback. I never once found myself confused. I think it might be because before the movie, I had seen people writing about how the past feels ""warmer"" while the present feels ""colder"". Going into the movie armed with that knowledge, it was painfully obvious what the timeline was supposed to be in every scene, even with 0 prior knowledge of the characters or story beats. I LOVED the parts where all the sisters were all on top of each other, both the physical staging and the dialogue.

I thought all of the editing and structural choices worked so well, and this film deserves an adapted screenplay nomination. Specifically the two beats I'm thinking of was 1) The parallel with the stairs and Beth's death, and 2) parts with the publisher wanting to change the story so Jo gets married. I thought both of those were brilliant. Afterwards reading what was in the original story and what was shown on screen, I REALLY dug the way Gerwig structured the flashbacks to frame the story. IMO having no relation to the source material helped with that, as I was coming into the movie completely fresh with no baggage. (I completely understand the other side though. I have a problem liking Harry Potter movies for that same reason: too much emotional baggage from the books).

Overall fantastic movie, I teared up twice. #3 of the year right now behind Jojo Rabbit and Avengers: Endgame, which for me is is pretty high praise because I ADORE those two movies.",ef4z7u
fd0w5l8,"The movie was so well balanced, it was everything at once. For all the timeskips, it was structured to be easy enough to follow

I liked how Jo’s speech on her contempt for marriage was grounded by the fact she’s so lonely at the end. Did not expect that to hit so hard

And I wasn’t so bothered at Amy and Laurie here, in part due to how authentic she seemed? They weren’t one-dimensional at all. The acting was on point, especially her and Saoirse. And the latter and Timothee, again. Maybe Beth could’ve been explored a little more but that’s my only gripe

One of my favorite scenes was the parallel shot of the stairs after Beth’s death because you just know. But I think that’s the most content I’ve been with an ending in a minute",ef4z7u
fc1nkb0,Can anyone tell me what piano piece Friedrich played while visiting the Marches?  Was it by a classical composer?  Any info would be appreciated.,ef4z7u
fcjo9ze,"It was nice, very Sofia Coppolaesque, but I don’t understand how some critics could describe it as a « reinvention » (how can you reinvent LW?), it’s still similar to the other versions. Even Amy doesn’t seem very different to me in this version. The only difference is the montage: not only the flashbacks but also the collection of very short scenes. I’m not a big fan of it: it’s a bit distracting and doesnt allow the interactions between the characters to develop very organically. It’s very impressionist : I can see the appeal, though, it makes everything looks more nervous and energetic, more contemporary.

I still prefer the 1994 version which I found more sincere and moving, and equally smart. I also believe there will never be a clear consensus on which version is the best, so it’s a matter of sensibility.",ef4z7u
feycrum,"My first time watching any Little Women adaptation and I enjoyed it, though the switching timelines did take a bit of time for me to grasp though I eventually got there. 

Florence Pugh and Chris Cooper were the standouts for me, although everyone does a good job in their role.",ef4z7u
fdivmtn,"I liked it a lot. I am big fan of Greta and it’s neat to speculate on Baumbach’s influence in her work.  The opening scene following Jo as she runs down the sidewalk from the publisher’s office was total Frances Ha. I also loved the style of how letters were read, showing the person narrating and just standing center-frame reading it. Little whimsical touches like that were great. I picked up on the warm and cold color palates for the tenses which was helpful in understanding the plot. 

I overall feel that this film ignited in me the warmth and rush of childhood excitement and friendship and the close, believable family connection that other movies have not. It was also the first real piece of film to make me stop and think wow - I want to have a gaggle of daughters/sisters like them (I have one brother). Their gentlemen’s club and play performances were endearing and wonderful. Loved the scene when Beth was feeding her doll at the table and the other two girls are just staring blankly at her. Hilarious.",ef4z7u
fd2oqef,"As a fan of the book and big fan of the 90’s film adaptation i was quite excited for this. Just saw last night and feeling the need to get some criticisms off my chest so here goes.

~ the score~ there was nary a moment of quiet. The second you think they’re going to let a moment between characters lie in the air for a moment, piano keys kick in and then we’re back to a sweeping score. Most of the time it was unnecessarily bombastic and that really got under my skin throughout the whole experience.

~ the time cuts ~ I know the story well so I was able to keep up decently, but I didn’t find it added. For me, didn’t convey the passage of time in an effective way and undercut what were supposed to be the most emotive moments, like Beth’s death and events of the Jo-Laurie-Amy arc.

~ young amy ~ i love florence pugh and i’m glad i got to see so much of her, but she is a full-grown woman with a woman’s voice, they should’ve gone for a young teen actress for young amy. It just didn’t work. 

~ mayonnaise characters ~ I feel like this issue is collateral damage from the time jumps, but Beth and Meg are don’t get much time to make you care about them. I know they are both meant to be more demure and kind of fade into the background amid the vibrant, attention grabbing personalities of Jo and Amy but they were just nothing characters in this. Especially Beth, which makes the movie suffer badly because her death is the emotional pinnacle, and they didn’t make me care. Maybe she could’ve been given more screen time and slashed the ‘i’m writing a book’ montage, among other fatty sequences.

~ overly self-aware monologue ~ in a film that obviously takes place in the late 19th century, Amy’s monologue to Laurie in her studio, while cathartic, comes off as hammer-handed and redundant. Most people who are deliberately hitting the theater to see LW would be aware of the politics of marriage, domesticity and women’s autonomy in the time period in which this story takes place. And if they weren’t, Aunt March’s quips here and there would effectively illustrate that.


As a positive note, I thought every actor was top knotch and the cinematography was fabulous. Other than that, for me, a disappointment.",ef4z7u
ff2es1b,"This was a beautiful movie.....BUT through the whole thing, I couldn't help but think how the 1994 version was so much better. 

* \-Thomas Newman score is pure magic
* \-Winona Ryder IS Joe (Ronan not bad though)
* \-Claire Danes' ugly cry death scene is so memorable....in this version Beth just fades away!
* \-Christian Bale is fantastically convincing as someone who loves Jo, has a deep love for the family, and is hilarious in the douchey playboy phase. Even though Timothee is older than Bale was, he looks like a little boy in the adult scenes. 
* \-In the '94 version, Amy being chosen to go to Paris over Jo had a deeper impact. It felt like a true devastation. 
* \-Samantha Mathis & Christian Bale had more chemistry
* \-Gabriel Byrne is wonderful as Behr, and has a deeper relationship with Jo. I get Gerwig's goal of not making their relationship a romantic one, BUT nevertheless Behr is a big influence on Jo going from girl to adult, and in this film that's totally glossed over. 

The 2019 version is not bad by any means, but the only thing I liked better in this movie was Chris Cooper and the Mr. Laurence/Beth storyline.",ef4z7u
fc21zg3,Chris Cooper keeps making me cry this year,ef4z7u
fcwoyb4,UGh the way timothee says I love you Jo amidst her rant on why they wouldn’t work together kills me. He says it with a tone that isn’t meek or mild. He sternly says it multiple times to show how much he really does and whatever she says wouldn’t change it,ef4z7u
fc290l4,"Let me first say that I’ve never read the book or watched any other adaptations of Little Women before. With that in mind, I found this movie very difficult to follow. Between the various time-jumps and ever-changing relationships, I was ultimately unmoved.

I didn’t find myself attached to any characters except Jo and Laurie because they dedicated so much screentime to these two. And ultimately, I resented the fact that Laurie settled for Amy and I am confused that Jo randomly ended up marrying the deus ex machina. Since everyone else didn’t get as much focus - I am bummed out by Amy marrying a man who will never love her back, I am glad that Meg married for love, and I am still processing the death of “the quiet one.”

I also think the performances for the present/flashback scenes were too similar. Everyone was at a constant “13 going on 30.” It also seemed like they were all dressing up in 2019. So all of the brilliant performances were outlined by an awareness that they were acting.

This all contributed to a Brechtian alienation that kept me from connecting emotionally. I am interested enough in these characters to watch previous adaptations, but this particular take left me wanting.",ef4z7u
fc4afzx,"first of all, it was such a lovely movie that i will probably watch again at some point. so many beautiful shots, and i loved seeing the girls' bond.

i have mixed feelings about the non-linear structure. i think it was a cool artistic choice, and upon a rewatch would tie the movie together well. *but* it was confusing for me and others who went in without knowing the plot, especially around Beth's death where the past/present lighting was very similar. i would've liked to see the sisters besides jo fleshed out more, especially meg—i think the non-linear structure didn't help this. but again, still a beautiful movie that i'll rewatch.",ef4z7u
fcxt3z0,"Oh, I forgot to mention that I really liked the Dashwood character. He reminded me of the stocktrader from True Grit, arguing with Mattie Ross. Not a bad dude, just up against a strong-willed woman. ",ef4z7u
ffcwj1a,Sorry but Florence Pugh ruined this movie for me. It was so uncanny to watch an actress who looks to be in her mid 20s act out scenes meant for a little girl. Why didn't they just have young Amy and adult Amy like all the other adaptations? The scene when she cries outside Laurie's window gotta be the worst acting I've ever seen on a big screen.,ef4z7u
ffjoexz,"While I agree that it's a great movie, I feel that Laurie's character didn't really develop. Timothee Chalamet is great (his proposal to Jo comes off as hilariously pathetic instead of dreamboat-y), but then Amy basically says ""yeah, you're a mess"", then decides that she will marry him and loves him, but...he didn't change at all? He at least has a bit of an ""a-ha"" moment in the books. In the movie, he acts kind of like a pathetic friendzone dudebro the whole way through. 

2019!Bhaer is so cute and I like to think Jo ended up with him, but that's probably the romantic in me. I know it was left ambiguous for a reason.",ef4z7u
fc3dqwh,"Got \*far\* more than I was expecting from yet another Little Women remake. The direction and performance of the movie was all-around excellent. 

Also, can't wait for people to talk about how bad Emma was in this as if they were ever gonna give a fair view of her. The fact is, anyone who saw this with actual serious eyes can tell she did an excellent job here and lent a great deal to Meg's character and how sympathetically she plays her. But yeah, I know, it's hard to get past your preconceptions especially when she's surrounded by other great actors, and it's easy to just mark her down without really thinking about it. She's given great performances before, and this might be the best of them.",ef4z7u
fc1j7a0,"Absolutely loved this movie, definitely the best adaptation of the book I’ve ever seen. I really appreciated how each sister’s story was fleshed out, and I ended up caring about all of them individually instead of just their relationship to Jo. As someone else said, this movie made me feel sympathetic to Amy which even the book never did. 

I see several people saying they were confused by the flashbacks. I saw it with my mom and she was also confused, and thought some of the flashbacks were dream sequences. I’m very familiar with the story so it wasn’t hard for me to follow at all, but I can see how it would be confusing if you weren’t, especially since the characters all look relatively the same throughout the film. I did notice the flashbacks had a yellow cast which helped a little. 

This might be just me, but I think Emma Watson looks younger than Saorise Ronan so it took me a little while to buy her as Meg. I know in real life that Emma is several years older though, so that’s probably a weird critique. I was fully into all the characters by the end of the movie though. I wanna see it again!",ef4z7u

Holy hell, she killed it. Every moment, pause, and line delivery was pretty much pitch perfect and natural. Taking a character from 12/13-19/20 is a tough job and she made it feel so realistic. I wasn't even bothered by the school scene. She easily deserves a supporting nomination. Hehe, a part of me wants to see a LW adaptation with Pugh playing the other 3 sisters.",ef4z7u

amy and laurie had this unique relationship-if i hadn’t read the book before i would’ve probably liked them as a couple- but if you read it you’d know they make no sense together apart from the fact that amy always wanted to marry a rich dude. 
also how they used the scene where amy gets her hand CANED for having limes in school to introduce amy to laurie and therefore force an introduction of the march family into the laurence home was just wrong and infuriating.anyways i LOVED that jo and laurie dancing and the propose turn down scenes.( unpopular opinion but i actually liked this more than the 1994 adaptation )",ef4z7u

I could just be slow but yeah, took me a minute. Once I got my bearings, I was all in. I loved the movie, thought the dialogue was great, the set design and costuming was really cool. Typically period pieces bore the shit out of me but there was something refreshingly modern about the way it’s done that kept me interested. It’s a long movie but didn’t feel like it at all to me.

I literally don’t see the appeal there (no shade to him as a person, but it’s a bad casting choice). Also - why aren’t some of the professional critics talking about the complete hypocrisy of him acting like considering money when marrying was somehow compromising their morals? He’s a man who already has a ton of money!!

I also didn't buy that he was in love with her.

Amy/Laurie, on the other hand? They were a perfect couple and I was more invested in their story than anything that had to do with Jo. 

I love Saoirse, but in general I just didn't connect with her Jo like I did in the books or the adaptions of Jo before her. I liked Amy more in this even though Florence Pugh playing a 12-year-old was ridiculous.

fc1wv74,"I generally liked the movie. However, I think the ending detracted from important themes introduced earlier. The daughters throughout the movie choose to follow their own convictions in choosing a man, instead of the socially acceptable and economically stable option. We see this in Meg's choice to marry the poor tutor over pursuing a higher class man, Amy's marriage to her true love over a wealthy man that could secure her family, and Jo's choice to reject Laurie despite his advances, either living the precarious life of a single woman in the 1800s, or marrying a poor and unconventional foreigner. 

Despite their repeated rejection of wealth and status in favor of love, the movie ends with the family in a position of greater wealth than where they began, explained by their sudden inheritance of their aunt's house, and possibly the unexpected success of Jo's writing. This economic success makes their decision to reject a stable life a lot less meaningful, making love the obvious choice instead of an incredibly risky and daring one. The movie would have been better if it ended with the daughters in poorer conditions than where they started, but still convinced their decision was the right one. We see this in a brief scene with Meg, but it is kind of undone by the inheritance at the end of the film, and should apply to all the women, giving their choices more weight.",ef4z7u

When Jo runs down the stairs when Beth’s bed is empty and it switches between the present and the past, that shot is done so well and absolutely heart-wrenching, similarly the scene when the two sat on the beach and Beth had really accepted her death.

Some have complained about the age of the actors being unbelievable, but I differ and actually like the adults playing young teens, maybe a result of watching too many musicals/plays with the 'thirty year old thirteen year old' You really just need to extend your imagination a bit, and the cast did really well at playing younger \*insert expected and deserved praise for Florence Pugh here\*.",ef4z7u
fcyqxx4,"I read the books (several times) years ago, watched the cartoon as a kid, and watched the 90's adaptation.

I got a little bit confused, honestly, with all the time jumps (Jo's hair helped me, but it seemed to grow very long again at some point, which didn't make sense).

And the ending. Um. It's like Jo really didn't want to get married, yet at the same time it happened after she did? Someone explain to me, lol.",ef4z7u
fczp96e,"I have not read the book but knew a little bit of the general storyline going into the movie. To say I was blown away is a bit of an understatement. The movie is funny, charming, heartwarming, and sad, and none of those feel cheap or unearned. The acting is phenomenal to the point where you absolutely buy this as a tight-knit, loving family who occasionally gets on each others nerves. I went with a friend who had seen it already, so I knew to keep track of the time jumps, but I think it is fairly easy to notice due to the hair styles and coloring.

fcbl4bn,"Just saw it. Cried off and on throughout. So so many thoughts. Overall, I REALLY enjoyed this adaptation. I'd give it an A-.

Growing up, I loved the 1994 version so that one I think will be my fave for nostalgic reasons, but this was a quality watch.

Things I Loved:

* explaining/showing how Laurie and Amy came to fall for each other
* making Amy likable
* super fine Mr. Brooke and Professor Bhaer (he's supposed to be homely but he was foxier than Laurie)
* the glances into Meg and her husband's relationship - Emma Watson was wonderful in this
* a peek into Marmee and her thoughts - I prefer Dern's Marmee over Sarandon's
* the cinematography
* this Jo was how I pictured her from reading the books
* the ending with Jo's school

Some Critiques:

* bat crazy or not aside, ain't nobody can play Laurie like Christian Bale, but Timothee Chalamet tried - give him a solid C for his portrayal
* the chemistry was not there between Jo and Laurie - I was really looking forward to the ""proposal"" scene to relive my angsty preteen/teen days where that scene ate at my soul but it felt watered down
* I also preferred Claire Danes's Beth to this new one",ef4z7u

fc8zwd4,"I just realized that Amy always knew that she would marry rich and Laurie always knew he'd be a March (not as apparent in this version as in the 1994 version, but it's still a point). They're both each kind of using each other for something.",ef4z7u
fc2bu39,"It was a beautiful adaptation and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The first time I read Little Women was in 5th grade and it’s been one of my favorite books ever since, so I was extremely excited for this movie. The casting choices and acting were superb. Saoirse Ronan as Jo was an absolutely perfect choice. Much like in the book, I still downright hated Amy’s character, but Florence Pugh‘s portrayal of her was fantastic and made me a little more sympathetic to her. Beth’s death was so emotional and well done. Even though I knew it was coming, I still teared up. I heard quite a few sniffles in my theater during those scenes. I wasn’t expecting the non-linear storytelling, I enjoyed it, but I really didn’t think it was necessary. There were a few times I had trouble discerning which timeline it was. My friend, who never read the book, had to ask me questions throughout the movie because the time jumps left him a bit confused.  One of my gripes with the movie is that it feels like Meg, Beth, and Professor Bhaer got shafted in terms of story. If I remember correctly, I don’t think Meg and Beth had much to do in the book either, compared to Jo and Amy, but I’m surprised they didn’t spend more time fleshing out the relationship between Jo and Professor Bhaer. It almost felt like he was shoehorned in for the sake of pairing Jo up with someone, but I suppose that was also meta in a way considering the publisher’s insistence that she end up with someone.",ef4z7u

She doesn't marry anyone and probably didn't inherit the house idk",ef4z7u
fcsmpj2,"Finally saw.

My really only con with this movie is the retrospective format I prefer the linear format of the previous version.

Also the turning down Laurie.  This breaks my heart every time I watch a version of this movie or read the book again.  I feel like Laurie and Jo are like Anne and Gilbert soulmates but they don’t get together.  

You know how Gilbert proposes to Anne and she says no.  But then she realizes she made the wrong choice and then the second time she says yes.  

You would think by now I would be ok with this but still nope.",ef4z7u
fdmhc3a,"I loved the film and thought it was just beautiful. The ending of the character arcs was a bit of a mess though. Many of them seemed quite rushed and left me feeling unsatisfied after feeling pretty invested in these characters for the past 2 hours. I didn't feel any chemistry between Laurie and Amy and the way their relationship was portrayed in the film seemed quite sudden and forced. In one scene, Amy is rejected Laurie as she won't settle for being second choice, and then in the next thing you know they're married? I know their relationship is fleshed out a lot better in the book, but the way the film presented it was very frustrating. 

However, the acting was all superb and I loved it's sense of wonder and inspiring nature.

fexw4m7,"I read the book when I was very young, maybe a decade ago so I didn't remember much beside the main plot points. I think the movie was beautiful. 

I know some people had an issue with the burned novel but I think  there's not much you can do about it in a movie adaptation. Amy is supposed to be a stupid angry 12-year old in the book, but the fact that Florence Pugh plays both younger and older version makes her look vicious as an adult as well. I just thought the timelines weren't defined that well, you were told in the beginning it's 7 years apart but there wasn't much indication of time until Meg's wedding when we found out Amy is going to Europe.

The performances were great, Ronan especially is a showstopper. One thing though, Timothée Chalamet... I don't wanna say his roles are becoming annoying because I truly believe he's a great actor. He's never bothered me until A Rainy Day In New York where for the first time I found him not believable at all (to be fair IT IS a Woody Allen movie). Idk if I'm on my own on this one.",ef4z7u
fgds1fr,"*Great* performances by the main four ladies, I was really pleased across the board with the acting here. Florence Pugh and Saoirse Ronan were my favorites.

Really good script, very tight directing, and the seemingly controversial non-linear narrative was a great choice, would definitely be a lesser movie if it was linear. 

Unfortunately, the pacing wasn't the best, and the movie ended up feeling way too long, and dragged quite a bit towards the end. Would've possibly been one of my favorites of the year if not for that, so that's really unfortunate.

7/10, huge shame about that pacing.",ef4z7u

fh23wtp,"My girlfriend took me with her family to see this movie. 

At some points I felt like I was watching a Disney movie with the romantic drama, and other times the storytelling was amazing. 

It feels similar to the movie Boyhood, a jump into someone’s life, except it’s a full family. I enjoyed the movie, although it was rather uneventful, it was monotonous, similar to actual real life. 

8/10. Decent theme, style and execution. A movie I enjoyed watching, probably would fall asleep watching again. It was heartwarming but I also felt like it was Oscar bait like Boyhood.

Edit: although this movie review is overly critical, this movie was great. It made me feel something which is rare in a modern blockbuster. Don’t underestimate a drama movie like this. It’s great",ef4z7u

And I absolutely loved this film.

I can’t remember the last movie I saw with a cast so well put together and where everyone is knocking their performances out of the park. The jumping back and forth in time really keeps the narrative fresh and exciting for a period piece set during a time most modern audiences might find boring. All of the dance scenes were incredibly choreographed,  the sets and costumes were great, and the pacing overall really couldn’t be much better.

Everyone is great but Florence Pugh really steals the show as Amy. What a year for her. And Chris Cooper in a smaller role is exceptional. 

Gonna try and wait a few days to find and cement it’s spot on my year end list but I’m 90% sure this will land in the top three.",ef4z7u

fcvdbs5," 

I knew nothing about this going in other than Joey put the book in the fridge when Beth fell ill, and that it had received glowing reviews.

I was absolutely blown away, what a bittersweet masterpiece.  What a joy.  What a sumptuous, modern, beautiful film, filled with wonderful, adorable, beautiful characters with fully rounded out motivations and relationships.

I fell in love with Saoirse Ronan's strong yet vulnerable Jo first of all, then Eliza Scanlen's pure, tragic Beth, then Florence Pugh's incredibly complex Amy, then even Emily Watson, who normally annoys me, as the content, loving Meg.  I then fell in love all over again with shorn Jo, then Chris Cooper's dignified Mr Laurence, then Laura Dern's Marmee, then Bob Odenkirk's principled Father March, and by the end even Tracy Letts's old-fashioned publisher Dashwood, Timothee Chalamet's gadabout Laurie, and Meryl Streep's cantankerous old Aunt March.

Brilliant performances, production design, original score from Desplat, sometimes thrilling diegetic classical music, sensitive direction of actors and skilful photography.

I have tiny qualms with the editing, which means the story jumps forwards and backwards slightly too often for my liking, and the issues of slavery benefiting even the Union's supporters and Mr Laurence's largesse extending to the well-enough-off Marches but not to the impoverished single mother Mrs Hummel, both of which are understandably brushed aside in favour of focusing on the story of the little women..

But those are minor quibbles, this was a hugely enjoyable filmic experience and proof if proof be need be of Greta Gerwig's immense talent.",ef4z7u
fcvrzqu,Absolutely loved this movie. I've never read the book (not gonna lie I was mostly interested because I have a crush on Florence Pugh) so I went in completely blind and fell in love with the characters. The only thing I hated was some fat fucking idiot brought his kids that were like 4 to the movie and they would not shut up and clearly had no interest in it. The Will Smith pigeon movie was playing next door so I don't know why they didn't see that.,ef4z7u
ffq6bnn,"I felt as though the movie pulled a lot of punches in its highly tense or emotional moments. There were many hard cuts out of the very real and uncomfortable moments like when Jo is hitting Amy, or Amy is pulled out of the ice. It would change the tone so dramatically, to some value or quiet scene. It made me feel like it was afraid to really take the audience there and lose its overall quirky charm. I think it made the very hard moments feel more postured and vapid. Instead of a movie of real moments with quirky and cute scenes between, you get quirky and cute scenes with real moments peppered in for just a moment. It feels so much like a show of manners, a facade. It’s not a journey as much as it’s a rollercoaster and I feel like an opportunity was lost there. Florence Pugh gave an absolutely amazing performance, though, as well as Saoirse Ronan. Emma Watson I left more to be desired. The wardrobe and set designs were flawless, really. It’s a culturally significant piece of literature and it’s political relevance makes it a shoe in for a masterpiece, but the movie felt phoned in and unfortunately I’m afraid it will likely be lost in the memories as Oscar bait and less of a realization of an artistic adaptation. This is just my opinion, I’m happy to discuss it. There are lots of things I like about to movie but I don’t think it deserves the Best Picture nomination",ef4z7u
fc2p8a5,"I adore the 1994 version but I tried to go into this one with an open mind. Overall I loved it. Ronan and Pugh were really impressive. Honestly all the acting was top notch. Even Watson, who I usually find unbelievable, nailed it. I loved the chaos of everyone talking over each other. I loved the Jo/Laurie proposal. My only complaint is with the ending, which fell flat for me because it tried to split between the book and the author’s life and just did both halfway. But even that may grow on me with more viewings.",ef4z7u
fccfc5f,"While parts of the movie were moving and the scenery was gorgeous, I became very frustrated with the amount of montage type scenes there were where just music and giggles occurred.

Although I liked the film, those moments too me out and I struggled to find complexity in some of the characters relationships.",ef4z7u
fhir8ne,"Sorry to say but I didn't like it.

I couldn't connect with any of the characters for most of the movie. Scenes happened and I just couldn't care.

The moment that defined Jo's character arc and made me actually interested in her was her rejecting Laurie. It's a ""oh shit what is she gonna do now?"" moment. But it happens near the end of the movie... 

The acting and dialogue style is too flowery and theatrical. Everyone is so goddamn nice and respectful to each other all the time. I don't care for this style of storytelling at all.

There were some cool themes throughout the movie, like women's obligations and duties in the era and how restricting they all were... Could be amazing if explored, but I don't think they were explored well at all. All the girls did as they wanted anyway and ended up happy so goddamn easily.

In short, it has no tension, it fails to make the characters likeable or relatable, it fails to explore its themes in a meaningful way.

Pros are: it captures the period well, excellent sets and costumes, has some cute, sweet and funny moments.",ef4z7u
fc1zjlp,Did anyone feel like the way that some of the character arcs concluded was rushed/underdeveloped? Particularly with Laurie and Jo and how they fell in love with Amy/Frederick.

fcigk5f,"Just got back from seeing this and I think it was a hot mess, but still worth seeing. The pluses are really strong performances from Saoirse Ronan, Timothy Chalamet and ESPECIALLY Florence Pugh, who grounded the movie and pretty much ran away with it. Laura Dern was also excellent. You could really see the woman who chose to be good versus a natural saint and I ended up with a lot of respect for her. You could see it wasn't easy but she's a grown woman, not in conflict or ambivalent, but still it takes a toll. Right before she proposes that the girls bring their Xmas breakfast to the Hummels you can see in every fibre of her being she doesn't want to ask them to do it, but when we meet the Hummels and the literally starving children, we see why. She HAD to.Another plus is the cinematography. And, the costumes are to die for, showing every second both the ""make do"" and ""poor relation"" aspect of the clothes - like contrasting fabric sewn into sleeves that are now too short, a ribbon tied around the waist instead of a sash, and the sense that these clothes have been altered and re-done to death BUT at the same time it's these are fabulous and if you found them in a vintage store you'd buy everything. ""The"" Laurie/Jo scene was well done and unambiguous - true to the book. In the 1994 movie it came across as if Winona Ryder made a rational decision to say no while her heart wanted to say yes. Here, it's clear Jo's answer IS based on what's in her heart, and that's the problem. It's also kind of a funny scene since Chalamet captures Laurie's immaturity really well. And finally, Amy.  The only sister with a true coherent narrative in this movie. Florence Pugh says every single line with intent and intelligence, so we understand Amy from day one, at any age. Giving her a crush on Laurie from childhood really helped the story. Their chemistry was very good, and I liked that it played with Laurie drunk much of the time. The moment where he grabbed and squeezed her face ""playfully"" but with something underneath showed exactly what was going on between them.

The hot mess: timeline is incoherent. I think flashbacks is a great idea but these were godawful, particularly as to Beth and Meg interspersing with Jo, and it relied 100% on everybody knowing the story by heart. Which I do but at times it's like - wait, WHAT?

Speaking of Jo,  what a mess. Ronan is great, wavering vowel sounds notwithstanding, but Gerwig forgot to deliver a point of view. What comes through most clearly is Jo's ambivalence about growing up. Not really about feminism and the role of women, despite her saying she'd like to paddle her own canoe rather than be married. She loves to write until the dreamy Frenchman Frederick criticizes her sensational stories, then she quits it altogether, even when Beth encourages her to write more. Then she basically forgets about him, and has the ""lonely"" confession to her mother, decides she wants Laurie and leaves him a letter. When he comes back she's snide about Amy, which was NOT the book (Jo respected the hell out of Amy in that part of the book). ""Did you put up with Amy's preening all the way home on the boat?"" Then is shooketh when she learns they're married. Chalamet plays their past sort of philosophical, like, well, that happened, and I've come to terms with it, and I really love Amy now and you're my sister. Jo is sitting there shaking from loneliness.  THEN Frederick shows up and it turns into a rom com cutting between OTT of the family trying to get Jo and Frederick together and Jo talking to her publisher smirking that her lead character didn't marry either of the men, and the publisher insists Jo get married. So what happened to Jo's loneliness if what we're seeing at the end is what happened in ""Jo's book"" (it gets so meta here it turns around and eats its own leg) and Jo is perfectly happy back in NYC with her in demand book and no love interest? It really drops the ball here because Jo's isolation and loneliness and regret over Laurie is played straight, and then suddenly it's, ""Nah, I'm a feminist, stupid publisher men trying to marry everybody off!""

A lot of it wasn't earned. Some of it came across as ""Here's the part where Beth dies"" versus telling a story/imparting information we presumably don't know. There's one part where Meg hugs her husband and I thought she was hugging ""the tutor"" because a second ago she'd been told John Brook was accompanying her mother to Washington and it's not a ""cut"" to a flashback.

Gerwig is really good at casting and directing actors. She changed some of Amy's story but it served to make it clearer for audiences who'd only be able to take it in condensed movie pieces instead of chapter after chapter.  It's like she put a lot of effort into Amy because she felt Amy wasn't as known or understood, but not enough in making a clear arc for Jo as to what Jo really wants/needs from adult life because it's Jo and we all know Jo. So scene to scene there's great stuff but it doesn't add up for her without work and filling it in ourselves.

P.S. Jane Houdyshell was fabulous as Hannah. Usually actresses in small semi-comic parts like this schtick it up or play to the camera. She didn't try to do scene stealing bits but she stole a few anyway. She was written as a person, not a ""character type.""

P.P.S. thought the movie relied to much on Jo hating Amy even into adulthood which isn't the book. It used it as a crutch. Clearly Amy WASN'T all the stuff Jo hated about her, so it just looked bad on Jo.",ef4z7u
fcjwn19,"What’s so incredible is that... Ronan is tasked with being the lead, the ambitious and nonchalant and almost strong “Jo.” Sometimes I find with roles where the audience is really following that person’s main journey, it can kind of feel like you’re watching a super hero... like the character can’t really have any flaws in particular, like they have to be a blank slate for the other characters and moments around them to happen to them. I’m not saying that it is a BAD thing either. Because that’s how we fall in love with lead characters in semi-contrived plot structures such as these, which is not a bad thing.

However, saoirse can be that blank slate, but damnnnnn, she also can’t JUST be that blank slate. There were numerous moments in the film that... the vulnerability, the weight, the definition she drew upon in the scene was so striking. I’m thinking of when Amy burns her book, they wrestle and fight, and then IMMEDIATELY cut to Jo crying her eyes out in the arms of Meg and Beth. Saoirse is luminous on screen. And of course, the “Woman have minds...” speech. Incredible. 

Pugh obviously as well was insane. Such a breakout and should get a supporting actress nod in my book even though she hasn’t been getting the precursors. I just also think Ronan had a tougher job... being the lead, being that blank slate, but yet she went the extra mile and gave real, true characterization to Jo.",ef4z7u
fd0un5w,"Okay so I really need to discuss this with someone because for some reason I was affected by it in the movie and need to know if other people feel the same way!!

I am familiar with the book and have read it multiple times, albeit not very recently and I never had much of a qualm with the Amy/Laurie ending. However, for some reason I just couldn’t buy that ending in this movie and for the first time I was super disappointed Jo and Laurie didn’t end up together.

First, the inclusion of Jo having second thoughts after the proposal and writing the letter to Laurie was an interesting addition because it made Jo seem uncertain (when in the book I didn’t necessarily get that vibe — but also like I said I haven’t read it in a while). I know I lot of comments are saying she didn’t really love him, she just wanted to BE loved, but just how she wrote the letter and put it in their childhood mailbox fully expecting that he would find it there (when clearly Meg, Beth or Amy would never check it) seemed kind of...intimate? Idk I can’t think of the word but it seemed like a pretty thoughtful way of going about it for not actually having feelings for someone. 

Then there was the scene of Amy refusing to be Laurie’s second choice, and he doesn’t even really deny it!! I felt so much for Amy in that scene, he could have gone after her and said SOMETHING but he just let her walk away!

Then after Laurie and Amy are married, the way he talks to Jo in the attic seems so sheepish, as if it’s his last ditch attempt to get her to react. It totally had a depressing vibe on both of their parts, he didn’t seem actually happy in his situation, more like... complaisant. 

But the scene that REALLY made the whole Laurie/Amy scene such a hard sell in this adaptation was when Professor Bhaer shows up and Laurie repeatedly demands (albeit kind of jokingly) to know who he is — it came across as kind of jealous and did nothing to convince me that he actually loved Amy, especially right after his conversation with Jo in the attic! 

All this paired with Chalamet’s and Ronan’s emotional performances during the proposal scene, I’m just over here thinking how did they NOT end up together?

I don’t know — if the intent of the ending was to totally sell Laurie being in love with Amy, it seemed strange Laurie’s feelings for Amy weren’t fleshed out more and instead that screen time was given to Jo and Laurie acting like they would totally be together if the circumstances had been different. 

I really loved the movie by the way. But like I said, knowing full-well how the story ends, I couldn’t believe how disappointed I was that Jo and Laurie didn’t end up together. Maybe I have to go see it again and pay more attention to the scenes of Amy and Laurie in Paris to figure out what I missed.

Edit: okay and I just remembered how reluctant he seemed when everyone was demanding Jo go catch her man?? Amy even had to say “don’t just stand there!”

Another edit: also did anyone else notice during Meg’s wedding, in the background Jo and Laurie are standing next to each other and she has her hand in his pocket? I think after seeing that cute moment and then immediately after having to witness Jo reject him was just sad all around

Tbh I could write a thesis on it at this point. Also I have no idea why I feel so strongly about this",ef4z7u
fc5dwjh,"Being English and male the book wasn't something I was aware of when growing up (I only knew it was based on a book from looking further into the film) so the changes and differences from the book were not something I could pick up on, which likely led to me finding less issues with this film than other people have. The modernisations that were quite prominent weren't an issue to me as they didn't stand out as my frame of reference for the Civil War was pretty much nonexistent.  

I really like Florence Pugh in this, seeing that Amy was a child early in the book was a nice find as I thought her Amy was incredibly childish early on. Saoirse Ronan gave yet another strong performance too, she carried the film well as the central character even though I thought all the performances were more than good enough.   

I've been a fan of Greta Gerwig from the first film I'd seen her in and with an original story and now an adaptation under her wings I'm looking forward to whatever she moves into next.  

I was lucky to see this in a preview screening a few weeks ago and am more likely to go and watch this again over Star Wars or any if the other films out right now.",ef4z7u
fcvg64i,"A disclaimer: I think I read the book, but as you can see, it's been so damn long I don't remember a thing about it, not even if I'd actually read it! So I just took in the story as it is presented: both the ongoing one and all the flashbacks that flesh everything out.

And this a story masterfully told: the production design, the camerawork, the editing, the music, the writing and the acting, everything lovingly crafted to perfection.

And about the acting: sometimes, when I see a character so vividly realized by the actor, I get that performance stuck in my head—like a catchy tune—long after I leave the theater. This may be the first movie that's got me with more than one, three in fact: Saoirse as Jo, Timothée as Laurie and Florence as Amy. With the confluence of great acting, great writing and where they were set in a great story, those three portrayals were unforgettable.

Another thing that struck me about this movie is just how vibrant it is: this is a movie where nothing particularly violent or even loud happens. And yet there's this natural liveliness that runs throughout the movie that is effortlessly riveting.

This is a movie that's incredibly rich in flavor, but never overbearing. It's one, I think, that almost anybody can enjoy.",ef4z7u

I see a lot of praise for the woman who played Amy, and I feel like I saw a different movie than everyone else. She was perfect as adult Amy, but as a child? No. She was terrible, and it wasn't her fault, she was just too old to play a child. In fact, she looked older than Jo and Meg. When she burns Jo's book, instead of being a child throwing a temper tantrum, she looks like a psychopath as she slowly burns each page individually, because she's clearly in her mid 20s. Every time she pouted she looked absolutely ridiculous. I hated the scene where she had been beaten by the teacher and went to cry to Laurie, because she was just TOO OLD to act that way!

The kid who plays Laurie was good as young Laurie, but looked far too young for adult Laurie. Emma Watson didn't work for me as Meg. She was fine, but she never seemed like a big sister to the girls. 

I also didn't like the non-linear storytelling for this, even though normally I don't mind that as a storytelling device. I just didn't think it worked here, for a couple of reasons. The first was that there wasn't anything to really visually distinguish the different time periods, other than the brief period with Jo's short hair and maybe young Amy's modern-looking bangs. I know the story backward and forward so I always knew when they were in the story, but my daughter didn't and was confused at times. 

The main reason it did NOT work for me was that almost immediately after Beth dies, we cut to a scene with Beth alive. Um. Way to kill the emotional stakes there. 

It was long, but I didn't feel like I really saw Jo and Laurie's friendship, or Amy and Laurie's relationship changing. And I didn't give a hoot about Beth here, and I don't even remember what she looks like despite watching the movie less than 2 hours ago. 

There were some positive things. The setting and sets were beautiful and cozy and homey. Saoirse Ronan was fantastic as Jo. I enjoyed the few additions, such as the ending with the chase to Professor Bhaer, and the discussion with the publisher about getting married. I also liked the scene with the little girls begging their publisher father for more Little Women. I liked that Jo and Beth went to the sea. 

I think they could have drawn additional scenes from the book to try to set it apart from the 94 version. I would have liked to have seen Jo's attempt to cook for Laurie, or seen more of the picnic with Laurie and all of his friends.",ef4z7u

fdmhxpd,"Well, I’m charmed.

I went into this one not knowing much about it. I’ve never read the book or seen any of the adaptations. Was a little worried it would be a boring period piece movie, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was a little put off by the constant jumping between timelines, but the characters absolutely won me over. Saorise Ronin was uniquely delightful and Florence Pugh popped off the screen in every scene. I really liked the way Gerwig shot the film. The warmth given to the scenes when the girls were together contrasted with cold after the devastating event was striking.

I’m not going to nit pick the plot because it’s a classic story. I felt Jo getting together with the professor was a little contrived, but I understand there is a reason for that that is hinted in the film (is it hinted in the book as well or is that a meta comment from Gerwig?). I was kind of hoping the story would take a turn and we’d learn Jo was gay and she was trying to navigate a world where society’s expectation of her would be doubly restrictive. But, I don’t think that subtext was included. Overall, I cared more about the first two acts than I did the third, but it was all very well done. 

8/10. Definitely recommend.",ef4z7u

fcaiyc1,"All of the members of my family saw Star Wars and Little Women this week.  

We all loved Little Women much more.",ef4z7u
fcjp4q6,"Loved it so much. Some scattered thoughts...

- The shot in the beach with Joe and Beth is breathtakingly gorgeous. Reminded me of the beach scene from Roma.

- I loved the conversation at the end between Joe and Amy how writing is a confirmation of importance not reflection of it. It very much describes what I loved about this movie. And I also love that I, guy in 2019 can relate so deeply to a story about 18th century women struggling to reconcile their dreams with the cultural obligation of getting married

- This was such a kind, gentle film. Aside from a few moments of anger from Amy, all the character were really sweet, good people. It actually made me realize that writing good stories about good people is way harder than writing stories about terrible people. But it does pay off when it's done right. I think that's why this, Lady Bird, and Call me by Your Name are some of my favorite films from recent years.

- When Joe says ""I can't believe childhood is over"" I teared up a bit. This is pretty much what I felt throughout the film, and the emotion it captured the best in my opinion. It really, truly, made me miss my family. It also made me really sad thinking of my mom alone in the house now that all her children had moved out.

- The scene where Saiorse and Timothe are dancing alone in the balcony is amazing. They both looked so stunningly gorgeous. I think I honestly have a crush on Chalamet now, I mean I did before too, but I also do now as well.

- ""Do you love him?""
""I think I care more to be loved.""
""That's not the same as loving.""
That was a wonderful exchange

- I also loved the exchange between Jo and Laura Dern about containing your anger and changing your nature.

- I loved Timothee Chalamet's dad. Such a wonderful person.

- When the dad comes back and says, ""My little women,"" it was such a sweet moment",ef4z7u
fclgf2q,"I think some people need a reminder that Timothée Chalamet is 24 years old. He's closer to 30 than 17. He's far too talented to be stuck in high school and son roles, just because some people believe that he looks like a teenager (he doesn't, Noah Jupe is what an actual teenager looks like.) 

Laurie at his oldest in the story is still younger than Chalamet is. He's a perfectly acceptable choice to play this role and the idea that he shouldn't be a romantic lead is honestly laughable, considering how much of a heartthrob he is positioned to be in popular culture at the moment. Not all men in their mid 20s look a certain way and we don't have to pretend that they do in cinema either.",ef4z7u
fd0e0ny,"Loved it. Had some qualms with the ending. I thought the acting overall was phenomenal, especially by Florence Pugh and Saoirse Ronan. The extension of Laurie and Amy's relationship beyond what the book allows for was executed expertly, which is something I was delighted to see come to fruition. The scene with Jo and Marmee in the attic--I want to be a writer, a great person, a *somebody*, AND I'm also painstakingly lonely--was by far my favorite. So many gems here. Thought the inclusion of Friedrich Bhaer was an interesting touch, but wished that his relationship with Jo had been left up to interpretation. Most importantly, I wish that the final school scene had been altered to match the themes from the rest of the film, and that it would simply have been less sugary-sweet and *convenient*. Amy is teaching art at the school? Meg is teaching acting? Really?! Overall, very satisfied with this interpretation, and impressed with what it achieved, especially given how far it strayed from the book. Would highly recommend!",ef4z7u

fcobf0o,"I don't normally like costume dramas/period pieces in this vein, but I loved almost everything about this movie. For context, I have never read the book (though I'm pretty sure I was supposed to in high school) or seen any previous adaptations, so I'm not looking at this in comparison to anything else.

What I liked: The performances are all solid. I know people take issue with some of the accent work, but personally I'd rather the performance that nails the emotion but not the accent than the other way around. Ronan and Pugh are the clear standouts, but I thought Eliza Scanlen was also great in more limited screen time and I even thought Emma Watson was good despite some of the pre-release buzz. This movie was also the first time I've ever really gotten the Timothee Chalamet hype, I thought he was great. It's really well shot, I thought Greta Gerwig has noticeably progressed as a visual director since Ladybird. I also thought this movie did a great job at capturing both grief and loneliness. And after reading Gerwig's defense, I prefer the ending the movie give us to the book, though I acknowledge that I might not feel that way if I had a previous relationship to this material.

What I didn't like: I thought Bob Odenkirk was kinda distracting. It's not that he's bad or anything, he just took me out of the movie a bit when he shows up 90 minutes in. I also think the opening scenes aren't as strong as what comes later.

Things I'm not sure whether I like or dislike: I'm not sure about using the same cast for both the child and adult portions. I just can't look at Florence Pugh and see a 12 year old (or whatever Amy is supposed to be). But at the same time I don't want to lose their performances from that portion of the movie, so I'm not 100% sure how I'll feel about this tomorrow.

Overall this is a 9/10 for me and it slots into my top 10 for the year. I liked this more than Ladybird, but I think both were great and I'm excited to see what Gerwig (and Ronan/Pugh, for that matter) does next.",ef4z7u

fc7ku30,"This was amazing. I confess that I had begun to read Little Women some time ago but did not manage to finish it. As I began to watch this movie I got a sense that it would be very difficult to make a movie out of this book: It is episodic, there are four main characters who have to be developed, and there are two main parts seven years apart. Would they use the same actresses, or would the viewer have to keep track of eight faces? I began to doubt the good reviews. It turns out it is all handled perfectly. The flashes forward and back turns out to be a brilliant move, that allows the themes to come together, using the characters emotions and memories, rather than chronology, to connect the story. The faithfulness to what I read was maintained. But the real greatness here is how it tackles the autobiographical and social backstory of Little Women, the context of Louisa May Alcott's feelings towards her own work, which are in the back of minds of modern readers familiar with her life. There is even a philosophical dialogue confronting the significance of a domestic story of four sisters (why many people will dismiss this movie without seeing it.). Overall, with this and her other films I feel Greta Gerwig has established herself as the greatest female director of her generation.",ef4z7u
fcjd1f6,"Being unfamiliar with the story beforehand and only really aware of the film because of being a fan of Ladybird, I definitely wondered how I ended up in the theatre as the lights dimmed. Very glad I went, what a treat!

Phenomenal cast and even as a non white male, the story resonated quite personally with me and definitely struck a chord. Despite being a ""period piece"", I felt that it captured universal themes of growing up, family, and finding our calling in life in a very compelling and touching way. The score by Alexandre Desplat also delivered, noteworthy scenes being Laurie's proposal and the wide shot as Amy boards her carriage back home from France upon learning of Beth's death.

Stellar film all round and still thinking about it days later.",ef4z7u
fcqlkwv,"This movie was so beautiful, wholesome and easy to watch and fall in love with it. Timothèe Chalamet has chemistry with everyone, I love walking out of a movie feeling happy, fulfilled and It feels like a warm hug or jumper for 2 hours.

Also, upon second and third viewings a couple of little things stood out:

So I saw Little Women for the third time. Some things I picked up on:

1. Jo was ambidextrous (you see her switch hands in a couple of scenes when she is writing, I thought that was a nice little touch)
2. Right before Beth dies when her and Jo are laying in bed you can hear the waves go out (earlier at the sea Beth talks about how she is like a wave, she goes out slowly but will go out—or something to that sentiment)
3. Marmie is wearing the same outfit when Beth dies and gets better (not sure what this represents, maybe nostalgia and always remembering your parents the same way)",ef4z7u
fc26qrj,"I just came back from watching this movie and I am floored! It lived up to my expectations and then some. 

The interweaving structure really brought a lot of life and dynamic to the story, which had been absent from previous film adaptions.

Greta Gerwig even made me like Amy much more than I ever had before. You could feel the passion and love of the original material. It was beautiful, moving, sad, and funny. 

Everyone should give themselves the gift of having seen Little Women in theaters. Some of the people in my theater applauded at the end. What an experience!",ef4z7u

fcwn6vr,I liked the movie overall however some issues I had with it was the fast dialogue. When all of the sisters are together brushing their hair or doing something they speak fast. I’m pretty sure I missed some dialogue in the first few acts. Also the pacing towards the middle of the movie started to slow down significantly. If this movie was on Netflix it would have taken me a month to finish it. And I’m kind of disappointed that Laurie and Jo didn’t kiss like they did in the original,ef4z7u
fc1x8uw,"I just got home from seeing this. I have a few thoughts, be grateful for any input or corrections.

1. I have never read this book, and though I'm pretty sure I saw the 1990s adaptation I don't remember it very well. With that said, I feel like you really need some context for this movie. There were a few blatant ""girl-power"" type statements in the movie which made me questions whether Alcott was very ahead of her time but subtle, in the same way as Austen is, or if that was Gerwig updating/editorializing. I think it would be more enjoyable if I had read the book beforehand so that I could appreciate the changes, and also have some clue about which ending is the book ending and which one is the one that Gerwig has crafted.
2. I don't really like Emma Watson as Meg. I personally don't think she's a very good actress (didn't like her in Beauty & the Beast nor the Circle), and I feel like she was out of place. Also I think she's too recognizable as an actress to be in what is fundamentally a minor role in this movie. She's clearly a bigger star than the other three, as evidenced by everyone wondering why she didn't attend the press junkets, so it provides an unnecessary distraction from Ronan's excellent Jo.
3. Again, as I didn't read the book . . . why is Aunt March rich? Her brother is alive, so why does she have all the money and he doesn't have any? She seems to blame it on marriage but that isn't ever really made clear.
4. I didn't like Timothee Chalamet (sp?) as Laurie/Teddy, he was fitting as a young man but then he still seemed like he was 18 when everyone else had aged. I think it has to do with the fact that he is so slender and baby faced. Presumably he and Vaughn are friends but Vaughn looks like a man, as does Frederick, and the guy that Meg marries. It's like he's a perpetual teenager and seems way too young for Amy who seems to age 15 years over the course of the movie.
5. Lastly . . .  and this may be the fault of the book and not the direction . . . the Civil War seemed oddly absent from their lives. I would think that with their father being off and half the country engaged in bloody combat where unthinkable amounts of people died, it would have merited being more of the plotline or at least dramatic tension. Honestly, I thought the father had died after coming back because he literally never shows his face when Beth is in her final sickness and then is suddenly there at the funeral. Am I missing something? Laurie presumably would have been draft age at some point, too
6. Was Beth supposed to be ""different"" . . . in one of the early scenes they are sitting at breakfast and she's pretend feeding a doll. I assumed that everyone in the book was at least in their pre-teens (12+) . . . were young women different then or do 12-year olds go around feeding baby dolls and I just didn't have a normal childhood?

Anyway, other than those random thoughts, I did enjoy the movie. Ronan was excellent as she always is, and I like Gerwig's direction and what I presume is the plot change at the end. I'm not much of a fan of making older books too modern in their thinking, but I think this was done well and with subtlety.  I should finally break down and read the book, I feel like I'd appreciate the movie much more.",ef4z7u
fc6xkph,"Very mixed feelings leaving this one. Went with two LW virgins who had no idea what was coming and loved every minute, but I struggled. 

Saoirse Ronan was outstanding and beautiful, as usual. Florence Pugh was fantastic as adult Amy, and while I think she did a better job than most would do, I didn't like her young Amy. She seemed to really try and I loved some of her expressions and gestures but for me, the fact that she is clearly a grown woman playing a child is just too much. If I recall correctly, I think I felt the exact same way in one of the TV adaptions (BBC?) about the young Amy casting being an adult.

I thought the imagery in this movie was stunning, but disliked the non-linear story telling. For me, the whole point of LW is that you're building up through their lives, watching them get older and change as they become women. This non-linear tale interfered with that feeling for me, because we're working backwards to unravel what makes them tick instead. 

What I'm most conflicted about is the fact I left this movie without shedding a single tear. I cry every time I read the book or watch the 1994 version, so to not do so at this makes me question what's missing!",ef4z7u

ff2ltsx,"I preferred this to the massively overrated Lady Bird, even after a recent rewatch besides Laurie Metcalf's wonderful performance, I still don't see why it got so much love when it was released.

Anyway onto Little Women (2019). It's definitely telling that Greta Gerwig loves the source material, and it shows on the screen. I find the switch from the past to the present during the film a bit jarring especially during my first watch. But it made a lot more sense on the second watch. I like Timothee Chalamet but it's tough to see anyone but Christian Bale as Laurie. Still don't understand the fuss about Emma Watson as a actress, smart thing done was keep her screentime as short as possible.

But it's fair to say that Florence Pugh steals the film as Amy, I think Saoirse could have a run for her money as the best young actress around. Although her role in Midsommar is the more impressive one, she still pulls off the young Amy to more mature Amy with ease. Great to see her get a Oscar nod for it. I think she's the highlight of the film. Saoirse is still very good herself, not sure it's Oscar worthy though imo. Laura Dern and Chris Cooper do well with what they are given. Eliza Scanlen as  Beth,  has the less screen time out of the sisters but still does wonders with it. One to watch for the future.

Gerwig is someone I think will have a Oscar winning film in her career behind the camera. Even though Lady Bird wasn't my cup of tea, and Little Women isn't quite up to the level of the likes of Parasite and 1917. The Films proved a big hits with it making over 100 million in the box office. She's someone who will knock out a few more great films. I like to see her get back to acting, as she hasn't done a role since Jackie and 20th Century Women.",ef4z7u

fc1vh2m,"It was cute. As already noted in nearly every review, Ronan and Pugh are the standouts. It's a good introduction to the piece for a new generation. I really enjoyed (as I typically do) Desplat's score here. It played very well with the tone. The screenplay was an elegant conflation of modern and period. Eliza Scanlen had a couple strong moments. I think, all in all, Watson was really the only one that didn't have a strong scene imo. Also, I have trouble distinguishing Chalamet the actor from Chalamet the person. I've just never been able to immerse myself into his characters. I know he's wholly adored around here but I've struggled to see it, even in Call Me By Your Name. And Bob Odenkirk is just too distracting for me to take seriously as a die-hard Mr. Show fan. Not really his fault, though.

I felt the movie was extremely theatrical and not what I expected. The flashbacks were confusing and the only way I was able to recognize that the year had changed was by the character’s haircuts. Amy looked and sounded older than her 3 older sisters and Beth’s death scene was not even a scene.",ef4z7u
fc1z34m,"Overall I loved the film. I can't wait to see it again but I feel like this time I wanna watch it at home, it will just give off a different feeling at home- in the best way possible. I would give it a 9/10 as of now anyway. Here are some of my thoughts about the film.

\- I think the timeline work both in and against the film. I thought it worked well by paralleling moments from the past and present. I thought that it enhanced many of the scenes emotionally. I also thought it made it a lot more entertaining for example I find some of the last half pretty boring so this way it makes it much less boring personally and gives me more of everything else, not sure if that makes sense but yeah. I thought that a lot of people who are unfamiliar with the story though might find it confusing, I think that if there was a way to make it a bit more distinct it would work even better. But I enjoyed it because it gave me something to look forward to (being that I love the first half of the book more)

\- I think that all the characters were great and got proper development. That being said I think Beth could have gotten more and Laurie just a tad. I think that the amount of development that Meg and Amy got really enhanced the characters so much more from everything else I've seen. 

\- I thought Florence pugh was really able to perform the role of Amy. She managed to be funny and loveable yet still kinda annoying and bratty. I also thought they really managed to portray a young girl while in her adult body, which is something that has bothered me tremendously since the 94 version.

\-  The Romances. I'm a Jo and Laurie stan and shipper so I always have a hard time with them not ending up together. I wish that they had more dialogue in this film and more development because we always saw them together but I just wish I got more,  I think I'm being selfish lol. I loved the part when she wrote Laurie the letter because that is not something I've seen before and in a weird way it gave me closure as a shipper of them. So that is something I absolutely loved. I thought their scene on the field was absolutely beautiful and my heart just broke for Laurie. I'm so happy Laurie and Amy finally got proper development. I've always hated them, now it's just more of dislike. I still don't believe he loves her, not the way he did with jo, but I certainly believe it more than other times. I can't believe I actually liked Friedrick this time around. That being said he and Jo still didn't get proper development. Which I'm ok with because of 1. I'm team Laurie lmao and 2. I thought it worked in an interesting way with the ending. This though was definitely the best casting of him though. Also, let's be real the best ship is Meg and John. They were so kind and sweet and though they didn't get a lot of development they had more than others and still had enough to fully like and understand them together. But still, Jo and Laurie deserve to be together. I actually think they work well together. I never really thought that Laurie liked the rich life as much as they make it seem but that's just my opinion. I'm obviously biased.

\- I think the artistic and technical components of this film are absolutely incredible. From Cinematography to production and set design and even sound editing (it was subtle yet very effective).

\- I thought this movie was quite funny particularly with Amy and Aunt March.

\- Oh and the score I thought it was beautiful

\- I want to watch it again so I can pick up on more things. When I watched it I really went in with my eye on Jo and her love life, Laurie and his as well as Amy as a character so next time around I hope to look deeper.

\- Overall I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed the pacing but I can understand why some people didn't. I thought Amy was so much better in this than any other. I thought her relationship with Laurie was finally done justice (even though I still don't like it). I wanted more from beth. still a really solid movie I loved it.

The only thing I can pinpoint that I didn't like was the editing. It felt really off at places. I'd put this around the same level as Lady Bird, an 8.5 or a 9. Greta did it again by making me give a shit about a movie I didn't think I would like.

The problem was the moviegoers near me. A girl next to me was crying and gushing snot for over an hour of the movie. She wouldn't get up to blow her nose so anytime something big would happen or there would be a small pause, I'd hear this nasty gush of snot go back up her nose.",ef4z7u

fc9dv6p,"It was good but people who’re calling it a masterpiece are certifiably insane. Its high on its own importance in a way Ladybird was not, aware of the discourse about female stories it dreads but also wants to enter.

Little Women is undermined by its writerly flourishes. When the writer doesn’t trust the reader to understand its subtext, they’ll throw in dialogue or a metaphor that will spell it out. Characters speak in thematic subtext rather than expressions of conflict. One of Little Women’s worst offenders is Meg and Amy’s encouragement to Jo that their domestic struggles are as worthy as being written about as any other subject. Is it as bad and direct as Judi Dench staring into the camera at the end of Cats, telling the audience to never call a cat a dog? Not quite, but at least the latter had the virtue of being funny. It’s nevertheless strange, as Jo had previously ranted to her mother about how women had extreme depth and were worthy of being written about outside of their romantic relationships. Were she so confident in that, would she need her sisters’ encouragement? Or is this just Gerwig’s lack of trust for the audience? On one hand, she trusts her audience to follow a nonlinear narrative (to be honest, handwringing from critics about how ""confusing"" this might be to people who hadn't read the book betrays a disgust for less literary types than concern). On the other hand, her characters speak in grand thematic statements of the world. 

It shows up at other times too. Jo's mother is lovely. What better way to introduce her than to see her give away the family's Christmas breakfast to a poor family? Halfway through we see her talk to a black woman about the shame she felt for her country. The black woman says, ""Not to offend, but you should still be ashamed."" What's the point of this, but to be both placate critics who may say the movie isn't woke enough, while also wagging her finger at white women who don't currently feel shame for their country? The black woman is a pure token. She isn't there to be a character, or at the very least a beneficiary of Jo's mother. She's there for the mother's benefit

Moments like these undermine Little Women's more interesting themes. It's a film about longing and self-deception. Its marketing makes you think it's another obnoxious #GirlBoss movie, but really it's about women who deny parts of themselves by ignoring their full humanity. Beth is said to be the best of the sisters. Why is that? She knows what she wants: playing the piano for her family. The other sisters reach for things they think they want but won't take when it appears to them, or they ignore their desires at the expense of others.

Gerwig had the confidence to let her characters speak in full in Ladybird. Why didn't she for Little Women?

fc3v7s5,"Anyone else surprised how bad the editing was at times? I noticed obvious ADR/unsynced dialogue in like a dozen scenes.

Also as wonderful as Florence Pugh is, her frowny face just makes me laugh for some reason. Same thing in Midsommar. Also having her play a petulant 12/13 year old in the earlier scenes was just ridiculous, but you just kinda have to roll with it.

Period melodrama isn't really my bag but the acting here was really stellar and I liked how the ending flipped things with the meta twist.

Found the timeline switching a bit confusing at times, but I did sink a few JDs and cokes beforehand, so it could just be me? On one hand it did allow for some effective parallels between past/present but I also felt taken out the story when I should've been focusing on it - I'm a total newbie to the story so I'm sure fans of the book will have no problem.

fc2dgv5,"Breaking down my thoughts on the film by characters

Jo- 
  *Positive: I like that they emphasized that Jo did not want to be wife. Something I always found that lacking in the other adaptations. My favorite bit was they party made it feel that it was Louisa May Allcott sitting with the publisher and not Jo. And I liked that the only reason why Louisa chose to give Jo the life she didn’t want because the publisher said so. That they sucked with showing Jo’s temper. How Jo was clumsy & a bit messy like the patch that was on the back of her dress, the stain gloves, and the habit of catching her dress on fire(more than the earlier scenes). Also they missed the point that the with Jo’s hair. 

Amy-
   That managed to show how the bitterness & the rivalry with Jo. Demonstrated that she was very veined with not just herself but also with her sisters appearances.  The hardly hinted that Amy had a crush on Laurie as a kid made it feel that only as an adult that she fallen for him. Amy’s reactions to how scared she was for Beth during the Scarlet Fever. Or how she bonded with Aunt March. 

Meg- We never really saw how Meg fell in love with Mr. Brooks. Her struggles with being a mother of twins. That they  never told us that prior to the story the Marches had money before and Meg wanted to rewind the clock to that time. 

Beth- That missed almost every development she had in the book. They rushed the Scarlet Fever episode missing how close she was to death then and the toll it had on her. And that while she was on the brink of death her father was also facing at the same time.For the most part that Beth was very much a mouse but they failed to show her early struggle to  play the piano at the neighbors house. 

The switching between timelines messed with the simple story. There was little clues to is the past or present. That cutting decision was extremely difficult for anyone who was unversed the story. I know this decission was likely a result of trying to be different from previous versions.  
If the film started with Jo at the publisher and told the story the story from the most linear timeline with maybe a scene or switching back to a scene or two in the present time I would been alright. While also ending with Jo getting a copy of her published book.",ef4z7u
fc6r8w3,"I was desperate to love this movie. As a fan of the story, 90’s film, entire cast, and director; I was slated to walk out awe struck. Sadly this movie did not meet my expectations. I love many of the stylistic choices of this film, but I was disparaged by the way the story had been told. I believe that cutting back and forth on the timeline only worked a few number of times. I also would like to say that the way this story focuses so much on Amy was a thrill for me. She became a character the felt fuller. We understood her more. 

This movie, more than anything, seemed like a love letter to Louisa May Alcott, I appreciate it deeply, but I do not feel as titalated by this movie as many critics. Wish I knew why.

fcjbcvn,"Just saw this and liked it overall. Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted for the most part. I actually liked the time jumping, I thought it made certain moments like Beth's death more emotionally impactful. As much as I like Emma Watson as a person, I felt her performance was flat and her accent was awful. I could hear the British throughout almost every single one of her lines and it really took me out of it. Saoirse in the other hand was incredible and really carried the film. I didn't care for Laura Dern and really hate that they cast Bob Odenkirk in this. For such a small role, it was bizarre to cast such a well known actor. Pugh was great as an adult but I didn't care for her as a 13 year old, it just felt over the top and I almost wish they had digitally altered her to look younger. The ambiguous ending was very refreshing and interesting. I was actually hoping she would stay single and I like that they almost left it up to the audience to choose their own ending, even though the book ends with marriage.",ef4z7u
fcpc366,"never read the book, never seen any other adaption or knew anything about it, it was in the same space as pride and prejudice and other classics of the 1800s, fucking 9/10. absolutely brilliantly casted, directed, written and re-imagined to the point where i actually thought the book was written in a non-linear narrative because of how clear, concise and flat-out awesome the scenes meshed. a perfect end to the decade with (i thought) a bittersweet ending. one of the only movies this decade where the credits rolled and the first thing i wanted to do was watch it again.

to me, the only flaws are that this movie is so far out of my usual scope, only one of my friends would ever even consider watching it and enjoying it with me, which i have no one to blame but myself. the second flaw is outside of the movie entirely, that i kind of expected ronan, watson, pugh and scanlen to be sort of a rat pack IRL, and work with gerwig more due to the amount of chemistry among the four actresses and gerwig's skill at picturing them with what seemed extremely natural direction and conversation. to that, i can only wait to see what the future holds.",ef4z7u

fc64ft4,"I....didn’t love it.  It’s not a bad movie by any means, but I found the first half hour hard to get through and the non-linear structure (a writing device I normally quite like) did not do the movie any favours. The cast I thought was generally really good, though Emma Watson’s accent slipped a lot I noticed.  Whole sentences in an English accent at times.  The last 30-40 minutes had me far more invested, though it took an hour and a half to get there.

Full credit where credit is due, I normally am not much one for romance plots, but Little Women did a great job in getting me invested in its many relationship sub plots.  

Overall, I thought it was fine.  Oscar worthy for costumes, music, and maybe set design, but not best picture worthy.",ef4z7u

fd2hr0d,"Having had some time to think it over, I’ve come to the conclusion that I hated this movie and I hate its source material. 
It’s cloying, too precious for its own good and the characters go from unbearably sweet to hopelessly tragic with no nuance. The soundtrack is overbearing and exhausting. The editing and directing are all over the place and there’s a bunch of dialogue that feels forced, too much of a wink to modern audiences and out of place. 
The meta quality of the ending is also a completely awful decision and Gerwig chickens out of actually delivering and updated, modern ending. It’s impossible to try and bring this story to 2019 without making truly revolutionary and courageous decisions with the storytelling. Her “fake romantic kiss” felt like an easy way out to deliver that heightened moment the director felt the audience would want but she wasn’t smart enough to trust us to be ok with a truly new conclusion. Cinematography is beautiful tho & Florence has the one good acting scene. 

TL,DR: this movie is bogus",ef4z7u

fciojh5,"I thought it was fine, but I wasn't blown away. I liked the non-linear narrative structure which broke up and modernized the oft-retold tale a bit. 

The sisters -- Emma Watson as Meg was miscast and very marginalized. Saorise Ronan was good as Jo, but her big speech gave me that ""Gutsy Women by Chelsea Clinton"" energy... Florence Pugh as Amy was clearly the standout. Eliza Scanlen also impressive as Beth

Timothy Chalamet was a bit shallow and too modern as Laurie... he is no Christian Bale as yet

Louis Garrel is easily the sexiest person in this movie, which is a new turn for his character. If Jo wasn't so quasi-lesbian, she wouldn't need to be told lol

I would give this a B+",ef4z7u
fcn4mvr,"I am surprised this is getting such positive feedback. I found the film deeply dull. 

You know at the start of a film when you have establishing shots, showing the scenery, the characters are chatting about inconsequential stuff, to set the tone? That's 80% of the film. A few shots like that would be fine, but when it comprises the bulk of the movie, it's hard to remain engaged.

On the plus side, the sets are amazing, the costumes are brilliant, the soundtrack is good, and it is beautifully lit and filmed. The cast also do a valiant job trying to wring some emotion and drama from the script.

However, that doesn't save the film. The primary problem is the direction and the script, which are both a mess. The director has this amazing cast and crew at her disposal, but wastes it. The end result is that the film has none of the charm or character of the book, or even any of the other remakes that have gone before. The 2017 BBC version was so much more fulfilling, as was the 1994 film version. 

The director has introduced a non-linear structure, putting scenes in the wrong order, presumably as a last-ditch attempt to introduce something interesting, but it fails miserably. The characters don't age or change visibly, so you are left reliant on vague cues from the scenery or script, but after a while you stop caring. You starting wishing the characters would all die just to add some interest. 

This is a deeply forgettable movie. I wouldn't recommend anyone watching it.",ef4z7u

fc7oa0j,"There is absolutely no doubt this is the best filmed version of Little Women ever. Even if it DID depart from the actual novel a lot more then the others, this captured the spirit of it the best. Unbelievable acting from ALL the cast. Greta Gerwig is stunning. I didn't think there was a female director better then Sofia Coppola, but she may have changed my mind.",ef4z7u
fcjf1g6,"Truly one of my favorite movies of the year, it was impeccable. Greta Gerwig did a phenomenal job giving us her vision of the classic novel — I liked this maternal touch that the film definitely has (and the fact she was 6 months pregnant when they wrapped! And she went into labor the day after sending the final edit? Shoutout to baby Greta, because that baby is a champ & a real one for letting mom wrap up the movie before coming out). 

Wanted to call attention to Eliza Scanlan as Beth. For good reason, lots of comments have called out Florence Pugh (ahem, Best Supporting Actress 2019, let’s get this right, Oscars) and the always incredible Saoirse Ronan, but Scanlan played Beth with a warmth that touched my cold heart several times.

Her scenes and her overall arc with Chris Cooper’s Mr. Laurence gutted me. When he explains to her why she deserved the piano as a gift, I dunno. I was just so happy for Beth in that moment since she was the only one willing to visit the less-fortunate family during the hard times without Marmee... and then Mr. Laurence says you remind me so much of my daughter...

What a beautiful movie. I cried so much. I also did not expect the non linear storytelling and thought it was brilliantly done.

There were two scenes I wish they kept in the movie, one was Meg calling out Aunt March for what she was saying about Mr Brooke, and him secretly listening the entire convo. I think that would have been a sweet scene and flesh out Meg a little more.

The second scene would be when Amy was cooped up at Aunt March’s house during Beth’s illness, Laurie visits her and she tells him how much she’s going to be less selfish, more loving and kind like Beth. That would have added more to the reason why Amy is less selfish in the present timeline.",ef4z7u

The way it was editing was a little jarring and frustrating at a few times, like when Beth was sick and I couldn't determine what timeline we were looking at (maybe that was the point). Acting was great, I'll admit I was on the look out for accent drops and only noticed one scene, overall the acting was fabulous. When Jo sees her mother after Beth dies, and when Amy and Jo reunite after she returns from Europe were standout scenes. Timothee didn't impress me enough, the women around him really carried their scenes. I did long for an epic score like Howard Shore's from the 94 film, but that's hard to live up to. I wished it were longer, the miniseries PBS did last year has been the most faithful to the book version, and you should definitely check it out if you want more of the March sisters.

fc4wqt3,"I am surprised that this 2019 version has received such positive ratings when it suffered so badly from casting choices, character development, and a confusing non-linear timeline.

Perhaps one of the biggest things that troubles me is that Florence Pugh looks like a 25 year old and we are supposed to believe that she is about 12-15 years old. To add to that, in the film, she really acts like she is about 10 years old. This was uncomfortable to watch, and above all, I am surprised that she is receiving so much praise.

Jo was ironically un-feminist by suddenly realizing she wants to be with Laurie, and by the end, she is given no freedom to make her own choice to tell the French professor she loves him, but is instead pretty much forced and coerced into believing she loves him by her overbearingly annoying family.

I did not feel attached to any of the characters and did not find anything memorable.

The movie does characterization and relationships so well. All the girls have distinct dreams and personalities. You get the sense they're really are sisters with their chemistry and squabbles. Saoirse and Florence are definitely the highlight of the movies and as expected they have the most screentime compared to the other girls. I like how in the modern scene a cooler tone is used as oppose to the past scenes which used a warmer palette. 

Also interesting about the movie was how it edifies that you can still be a strong, independent and successful woman, while still being romantically intwined. Given how Jo seemed a lot happier when she was with Friedrich as oppose to the monologue she gave to her mom where she told her how lonely she felt. 

Only thing felt off about the movie was maybe Saoirse and Emma's ages in the flashback scenes since they still looked the same age(Emma is also 29 now in real life). Someone mentioned that Amy was suppose to be 12, but I thought she was like 14 or 15(to be fair Florence Pugh did look younger with that hair style and attire).

There was not one single POC. Character development was pretty poor and chemistry was seriously lacking or non-existent between some. The non-linear structure of the movie, whose intent was probably to keep the film interesting, totally disengaged me from what was going on and I’d get lost. Bob Odenkirk showed up 3/4 through the film, but it wasn’t enough to save it. His character was so useless in the film, anybody could have done the job. Truly, they should have got other, more low-key talent to do the job and shine a bit because when you take into account the names in the film, that’s when it truly becomes disappointing. It’s as if directors can gather A-list actors to play dress up with a 40 million dollar budget and it’s automatically critically acclaimed.

2) After that, Amy marrying Teddy/Laurie was just... what the fah. Her character also had a bit of a zig-zag. Like they chose the wrong actress or something... Because something didn't match/align with her... there were times she was simply unbearable (burning her sisters book, trying to latch on to her date, and taking her man... the hell) but there were times she showed maturity and support... perhaps the writers way of showing layers and shades of gray to her...

The early scenes are BURSTING with energy, feel very free form alive, and the later scene have very tight and sharp dialogue. The filters really added a lot to this I think.

fcje79o,"Yep, the color filters helped a ton! I also followed Jo’s hair for the first few jumps, haha.

Ya, that was some bad casting. I love Bob Odenkirk but that took me right out of the movie, and then it didn't help that the handling of his character after his first appearance was very sloppy. He was suddenly assumed to have been there in the present the whole time, but the first thing we see of him in present day is Beth's funeral?

fdlo6on,"You may love that scene even more when you learn that:

Amy's speech about marriage was not in the initial script, but was suggested by actress Meryl Streep. After working and talking with director Greta Gerwig, Streep asserted that there needed to be a moment in the film that gave modern audiences the opportunity to understand the true powerlessness of women in that period; not only could they not vote or work, but through marriage they would lose ownership of their money, property, and children. The speech was written shortly before shooting the scene, and became one of the most powerful moments of the film.

AND 

According to Florence Pugh, Amy's big speech to Laurie about marriage was given to Pugh by director Greta Gerwig a few minutes before they were due to shoot the scene, it was handwritten on a piece of scrap paper.",ef4z7u
fc6xu7c,"Hands down my favorite scene in the movie. The writing was great, but Florence Pugh elevated it. She's such an incredible actress.",ef4z7u

fc5w35w,Also loved this scene and the whole topic of what it means to be a woman and have little options for independence in those days. It wasn’t really discussed in previous movies it was a good way to make this movie more modern and Amy’s scene was perfect.,ef4z7u

fc1iuuy,"Sorry, but I felt that Amy's character was wooden and comically out of place, especially considering the awkward and cringey emotional arc that her character goes through from when her character and Laurie first interact until the end where the sappy emotional mess is bizarrely resolved. Also, Laurie's relationships were all pretty boring to watch and nothing about the relationships seemed realistic. Every time she spoke to the love interest guy (he was so forgettable) I was like "" Michael Bay could have written a better love triangle"". Overall, 6/10, it would have been better if it was more solidly acted and not so overwrought with chintzy cliches and tired old sexist stereotypes. These women were supposed to be empowered... but instead, they all seemed like the had the enthusiasm of CVS employees on a night shift.",ef4z7u

fct1qc8,"Can you give me a reminder of THAT scene, please?",ef4z7u
fc3uwjl,"Absolutely! It’s not as obvious as with book Laurie or Christian Bale’s Laurie, but he was a bit of a March opportunist. He always knew he would marry into the March family — if he had his druthers, it would have been Jo. He didn’t have much family, so he was drawn to how close the Marches were and craved being a part of that. Bale’s version is much more opportunistic than Chalamet’s.

The very fact that Jo has to ask Laurie if he really loves her is telling. Chalamet makes some good acting choices in that scene: he’s trying to sell the Amy relationship to Jo to avoid creating conflict among the sisters, he wants to make it seem like he’s moved on to look good to Jo, and he wants to protect Amy. Laurie wants to make it seem like he really fell for Amy so Jo won’t think she was “second,” after Amy tells Laurie she fears always being second to Jo. I find these motivations to be richer and more complex than Bale’s.",ef4z7u
fc257z7,"This was exactly what I was talking about with my mom after - I bought Amy loved Laurie, I bought Jo did not love Laurie, I bought Laurie loved Jo...

fc66py1,"I think you hit the nail on the head when you said that it was a meta ending.  My understanding is that the book was originally released in two parts. Alcott intended for Jo not to marry anyone, but received so much pressure by the publisher to have her marry that she finally relented. But, she intentionally had Jo reject Laurie and instead wedded her to a random person she introduced, as sort of a joke and FU to the editor.

Gerwig wanted to incorporate this story into the movie somehow, so she set up Jo to be sort of a stand-in for Alcott (who herself never married).  The monetary terms that Jo negotiates in the movie were apparently identical to the actual terms that Alcott negotiated for ""Little Women"" herself.  I think the movie ending in this implies that Jo should not have married anyone, but ends up marrying Friedrich so that there is a feel-good, happy ""storybook"" ending.  I really liked it : )",ef4z7u

fc3ci1x,Agreed. They were both slightly above average at best!,ef4z7u
fc2b2o0,"I’m much older than your brother and ashamed to admit I also didn’t get this until I chatted with my forgiving girlfriend outside the theater afterwards. What can I say, I’m a dumbass. I’ve never read the book or seen other adaptations. When the nonlinearity was explained to me I did remember the one time at the beginning of the movie there was a “7 years earlier” subtitle, but after that it just never really occurred to me it was jumping around. I did not notice that Beth reappeared after dying. It might have helped if there was some more apparent difference in age in the very young characters...

For a while I was also confused by the two different names for Teddy/Laurie and was trying to figure out if there were two different actors who looked very similar. I didn’t know the actor and I’m not great with new faces.

Meg’s husband seemed to come out of nowhere to me — I guess he was in a couple of scenes before their wedding but I felt like there was no development of his character or their relationship whatsoever. I suppose it’s understandable though, movie was already pretty long.

Finally, I thought the ordering by age of the sisters was supposed to be Jo > Meg > Amy >>>>> Beth. Jo just looked older to me (maybe Emma Watson will always look 18ish to me because of Hermione) and Beth looked really really young (way younger than Pugh as Amy, she looked fairly mature to me since I last saw her in Midsommar) but I guess Beth was just supposed to look sick.

Anyway despite my embarrassing lack of comprehension I still enjoyed the ride so props to Gerwig and the cast.

fcwflou,"I thought the random talk to the camera thing was self-indulgent and pointless. I didn't like the inconsistency of tone and style at times, and this is part of it. There's all this discipline in the look of it, the lighting, the relationships, and a lot of sloppiness with the narrative and editing.

She's not alone, though. I finally saw Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon A Time in Hollywood. Was bored to death and it was not even funny, though it tried to be.  However, most of the movie was kind of a laid back, take your time, shambling hang out movie where the main thing the viewer did was soak in the period atmosphere and rhythms, and enjoy the Hollywood nonsense. So I lowered my expectations and started just taking it that way.  All of a sudden in the final third of the movie a narrator kicks in. I was like - wait - what? It just came across like Tarentino was running out of room so he had a narrator tell us what was going on since he hadn't bothered to dramatize it in the script. With Little Women, it's kind of the same thing I guess - we have information here but no time left to dramatize it, so let's just have them talk to the camera. Although on second thought I'm not sure any of the info we got from the talking heads was important. Why not just do one of the many establishing shots the movie did as we hear Jo's voice?",ef4z7u

His introduction in the past was fine but distracting because it's Bob Odenkirk, but then he's suddenly there in the present at Beth's funeral as if he was always around in the present, even though we hadn't seen him in that timeline yet?

fc1lx9d,agreed,ef4z7u
fc4fl4e,"I get the impression that Emma Watson’s personality may not be all that different from Meg. Accent aside (she did a great job with the American accent btw), Meg and Emma have the resemblance of barring much of their romantic notions inward while doing their best to be responsible, to meet expectations of others, or to give themselves for a noble cause that benefits others. Belle and Hermonie have these traits as well.

I imagine Meg is a character that resonated with Emma, but not so much with Gerwig. Jo and Amy are Gerwig, whose passionate and fiery spirits drive them to be something more. However, Meg is an anti-Gerwig. Thus, the tamed and subdued subtleties of both Meg and Emma got syncopated by Gerwig’s necessary and merciless focus to drive her singular heroines to the finish line.

Since Emma being Emma Watson, we tend to expect something more upfront, and centered, but because her role becomes relegated to the background without an opportunity to make a strong impression we can’t help but compare her against the strong impressions we got from Ronin and Pugh, whose characters and stories were designed to give the actresses to shine and pop.

I don't even want to hear anything about ""next to Ronan and Pugh"", like God. She completely held her own here, and people are being unfair to her because they were going to dislike her no matter how well she did.

I read (and reread) the book as a kid Amy was always my favorite character and I loved the Amy/Laurie romance, so I was confused by film adaptations hyping up Jo/Laurie (a friendship that I absolutely loved) and discovering that the 'fandom' has read it as Jo/Laurie forever lol. I thought this particular adaptation was better overall to this relationship and Amy's character, but I think it could've used a better transition scene to show them falling in love and not sort of make it out as if Amy had been pining for him since they met (which wasn't at all the take I got from the source material).",ef4z7u
fen29at,"I just went back and re-read the book and I think it works a lot better than a movie adaptation to make clear their love, partially because it takes time to develop.

Laurie is heartbroken over Jo, goes to Europe, sees Amy for several weeks who then tells him he is doing nothing. Then, he goes to his grandfather, then to go write an opera where he begins to get past his heart break and feel better before returning to Amy and spending well over a month with her. 

Any screen adaptation makes the process look super quick and this one was no different. I think the book gives you time to see the romance develop wheres the movie it always feels like it comes out of nowhere.",ef4z7u

I know Gerwig is not big into continuity but I've read ( and was with folks) where many didn't buy him as an adult Laurie despite his excellent acting. I think some of the wardrobe choices unfortunately emphasized this ( like that amazing scene with Amy in her Paris studio. So good but he looked like a kid with her in the outfit they chose for him). It distracted from his acting gravitas which is a shame because from his own real life wardrobe choices you can tell he's capable of looking more mature and older. Is it intentional?

I think it’s open to interpretation hinting to the fact that Jo was gay, but obviously a much less accepted thing back then. The publisher said endings need to have women be either dead or married.

I think that in some earlier adaptions (and in the book?) it is more straightforward that she is just happy for the outcome as having Laurie as a member of her family was all that she wished for.

""Also I think it was bullshit when everyone is telling Jo to go after Frederick and Amy says she's never seen her happier - how about any time she's with Laurie?!""

Well, that part SHOULD seem bullshit as it is the forced ending the editor asked Jo to add to her book - I noticed after second viewing that the color grading changes from the cold blue to warm yellow after Bhaer leaves the March's house hinting that everyone encouraging Jo to go after him (and stuff that follows) is part of the book (but not necessarily part of the reality).

fc75lic,">In the scene where Laurie reveals to Jo that he married Amy, she asks if he loves her. It couldn't be more obvious that the answer is not an enthusiastic yes. He hasn't fallen head-over-heels for Amy. He likes her, but more importantly, he always wanted to be a March, envious of how close and loving the family is, something he never had. Jo rejected him, Meg was never an option, Beth was dead. Amy was a fine settle.

>Laurie married Amy, not because he loves her passionately, but because he wanted to be loved. He knew she loved him.

If that's how they played it it's a rewrite, since Laurie clearly loves Amy in the book. Of course he's not going to come home and rhapsodize since he knows Jo has had a hard time, but Jo notices he keeps saying ""My wife"" because he loves to say it, and his face turns ""rapturous"" when he hears Amy's voice. In Europe, Laurie tries to write an opera using Jo as inspiration but he keeps failing because he keeps having fantasies of Amy instead.  There's a comical passage over Laurie's struggle and determination (in Europe) to keep his love for Jo ALIVE, because it keeps dying and he keeps seeing her in provoking, unromantic scenarios in his head instead of the deathless romantic tragedy he imagined he'd be living forever. He even tells Jo he thinks he would have been sorted out naturally (Jo as sister, Amy as wife) if he'd given himself time.   In Europe he gets so annoyed at how he's not keeping the flame alive that he writes once again to Jo, figuring that will do it, but she knocks him flat again.

Greta Gerwig actually says the difference between Jo/Laurie and Amy/Laurie IS passion. That clearly Amy/Laurie want to fuck. Whereas that's not what Jo and Laurie are about.

Laurie's initial emotional confusion makes sense. He grew up motherless, without feminine influence. Jo became this ideal - a sister, a girl, a best buddy. It's a ""romantic friendship"" in the classical Victorian sense (chaste, but emotionally intimate and inspiring). He also wants to be part of the family, AND he's ready to be in a relationship, period (I think) while Jo is not. Laurie is for her part of the idealized family of origin she never wanted to alter.

""Always wanted to be a March"" was a conceit of the 1994 film, but not in the book.  However, it's clear (as in Austen) that for Alcott the ideal romantic relationship has the couple as dear friends as well as lovers, and that would have been a tough one to pull off in Little Women if Laurie hadn't married a March. Another issue, IMO, is both Jo and Meg sort of hero worship the men they marry. Bhaer is like Jo's mother and three sisters all bundled into one. He's has so much personal warmth he can heat an entire house, he's an intellect, well read way beyond where Jo is, he's older, far more educated, and blah blah including cuddly, generous, kind and smart. He's where Jo aspires to be. And of course John Brook the tutor is so so patient with young young Meg. So it's left to Amy who actually has a marriage with an equal, which may be another reason some readers/fans think Amy unfairly made out the best. She's the only one not being tutored in life at the knee of her husband. It's more like vice versa.

PS - when you read Little Women, IF Amy has a crush on Laurie, it's very subtle and I'm not sure intentional by Alcott. It's most clear in one line.  Young Amy says something like, ""Laurie is a remarkable boy and can't be compared to regular boys."" when she expresses an opinion about boys and Jo or another sister tell her, ""But Laurie..""",ef4z7u
fc7qen2,"The irony I found amusing is that though Amy felt she was second to Jo due to her keep getting Jo’s “hand me down” in life and having been overshadowed by Jo’s talent and ambitions. Jo probably felt she had lost to Amy somewhat when Amy was chosen by Aunt March as her companion to Europe instead. Jo probably felt a similar way again when Laurie told her he and Amy were married. Not that Jo was resentful in any way. In fact, she forced herself to be graceful in both accounts so that Amy and Laurie’s excitement wouldn’t be spoiled by her disappointments. 

Also, Ronan’s reactions were on point in both those scenes.

So what Jo had from the beginning became Amy’s. Amy was going to settle for an economical marriage but ended up with the one she loves. Yet, Jo’s losses in life eventually honed her as the writer she longed to be. This ties back to the quote from the beginning.",ef4z7u
fcc70f5,"100% agree in they both want to be loved but aren’t in love 


I don’t think anyone expected Greta Gerwig to turn an adaptation of Little Women into her senior thesis but this movie really layers in her academic criticism of the novel

For my part I initially read his answer as his being sheepish to admit feelings for Jo's sister after he passionately confessed to her earlier in time.

fckhxhu,"I agree. I liked the movie for the most part until I hated the end. I am that person that loves Friedrich for Jo and thinks Laurie and Amy are a pretty good match too. If anything, the ""twist"" at the end should have been in the publisher's office and he calls her Miss Alcott. That way you can acknowledge that LMA based the book off her own life, while acknowledging she never married. Don't try to change the end of a beloved book.
It sat poorly with me because moments before we see Jo distraught over being lonely and ready to accept Laurie if he asked again. I wasn't a fan of that either but could have accepted it if not for the end, minutes later, Jo is alone away from her loved ones. To me, she didn't look happy. She seemed resigned and kind of sad, stuck reliving the past through her book to remember happy times but never truly experiencing it again.",ef4z7u
fcjs5uq,"How do we know that Alcott didn't have to pair Jo off? The scene where her publisher pressures Jo to have her protagonist married seems pretty realistic to me for the time it was written in.

It's not about romantic subplots making female characters weak. If that was what Gerwig really believed, then why wouldn't she change the endings for Amy and/or Meg as well. Meg even gets a speech about how important marriage is to her and how just because her dreams are different to Jo's doesn't make them unimportant. 

It's about the fact that back then, just like now, there were women that didn't want to marry, just like Louisa May Alcott didn't. And that Jo is written that way throughout the story. So her ending her story married and having given up writing has never felt realistic to the majority of readers. And Gerwig isn't outright stating that she doesn't marry Friedrich, she's saying you make your own mind up for what makes the most sense to you. She's allowing for the possibility that perhaps that ending wasn't what Alcott - who Jo is heavily linked to - intended either.

I also wouldn't say the film doesn't show their intellectual connection, it definitely does. But trying to portray an entire novel effectively in a film is difficult and this film is already pretty long.",ef4z7u

fc1fzqi,"I agree I did feel a bit of the undercutting of their romance which was disappointing. I would have like liked to see them have more conversations about stuff but I think the part with Jo’s letter made up for it, for me anyways(it’s a bit hard to explain) I found that really sad and depressing. I ship them a lot so it made me happy that she would be with him( I know they tried to make it like she didn’t love him like that but idc I still love them) but yeah I didn’t feel it as much as I had in other movies.

fc3tuqp,"Oh man, I just had a realisation: 

I think there was only one time I was confused with the flashbacks and that was when Laurie and Amy came back from Europe and he was like, “Amy’s my wife”. 

And I just realised that Amy was in Europe with the Aunt and she didn’t go back to live there... which was what I thought, regardless of how many times people said she was on a trip. I dunno. 

But I spent a while being like;

- is this the first time they came back (Laurie and Amy) or the second time?

- Does this mean they got divorced and then got back together?

Then I looked at Amy’s outfit and saw she was wearing what she wore originally when Laurie kissed her and realised this was in the “present time”, or “after Beth”

fd64s38,"So between the time I posted my original thoughts about the movie and now, I re-read the book and yes, it expands much more on Laurie and Amy’s relationship — It doesn’t seem so sudden and forced as it came across in the film. And Jo seems much more resolute in her decision to reject Laurie’s proposal in the book as well. Obviously the movie has limited time to expand on these things but I think it did go about it in kind of a strange way (i.e. Laurie and Amy’s interactions making it seem like they’re settling, Jo second guessing her decision, etc.) overall the book did have much more satisfying character and relationship development, as it would. I really did enjoy the movie though and thought it stayed pretty true to the book despite not being as fleshed out.",ef4z7u
ffwtikk,"In the 1994 movie, Amy is played by 12 year old Kristen Dunst and 24 year old Samantha Mathis with 20 year old Christian Bale as Laurie from 16 to 23.  There's a scene in the 1994 version where 12 year old Amy worries that she'll never kiss a boy and Laurie promises he'll kiss her if she wants him to when she's grown up.  It's played like he's humoring her, but it lays some groundwork.  I don't think that scene is from the book, but the movie plays like Amy is rekindling a small childhood crush and Laurie is suddenly seeing her as a contemporary.  It isn't a great love story per se, but Amy and Laurie have a deep history and understanding of each other.  

The March sisters are hugely based on Louisa's own sisters.  Anna Alcott was the actress of the family when she was young, but she gave that up when she married John and had two boys (not twins).

Many Jo stans blame Amy for 3 things, and only the book burning is valid. Everybody agrees it was a very bad thing for a CHILD to do, and the family let her know it. She's blamed for marrying Laurie. Jo turned him down in person and by letter. Amy's blamed for hanging out with Laurie in Europe, as if he doesn't have free will, as if he's still burning with love for Jo when Alcott clearly reports that's not the case and has a comical time showing Laurie's struggles to keep his heartbreak alive when it's fading daily. Even when apart from Amy for months he keeps thinking of Amy instead when he tries to think of Jo. And the European trip itself - the day Jo sabotaged her own chances of ever going, Amy was beside herself trying to get Jo to behave maturely and failed and had to give up. Neither girl had any idea a trip to Europe was on the line but if Jo had listened to Amy, she'd have been the one to go.

I'm glad Amy fans are making themselves heard. Whenever Little Women is filmed, most of the time the director and writer behaves as if every reader only identifies with Jo. It's just not true. Amy has an enormous number of fans.

She wished to reverse her decision and wanted to choose love instead, but she already made her choice and paid the price. The unread letter, her last attempt to retreat to her past, torn and washed away. It was too late. Laurie moved on, something that she thought she wanted. 

In the book, Jo didn't really regret not saying yes to Laurie, and she did want him to move on, but she didn't want to be left all alone. She goes to NY in the first place and her mother says to her ""I think there's another reason?"" than the one Jo gave and Jo admits, ""I think Laurie is becoming too fond of me."" And her mother is, so you don't feel the way he's beginning to feel?"" and Jo is nope, nope and nope, while reiterating he's a dear brother to her and a bff.  Her mother says ""I'm glad."" and talks about how they would not work on that level.

When she comes back from NY (I forget why), she's established such a strong bond with Bhaer that even Laurie is suspicious. When Laurie is in Europe and Jo is separated from Bhaer (whom she adores, but has no hope for at this point for a reason I forgot) she confides her loneliness to her mother who asks if she regrets her answer to Laurie and Jo says if he did ask again she might say yes, *not because I love him any more than I did then but because I care more to be loved than I did back then.""* She's lonely, and at this point Laurie looks like he was her one shot, but it's clear it's not about her love for him but her need to BE loved. Then Bhaer comes back and Jo brightens up no end.

The movie would be endless if it did as much to establish Jo and Bhaer as the book does. At least this version properly establishes Amy and Laurie. When I re-read the book, it struck me that in his very being Bhaer emanates that warmth, hearth and home and unconditional love Jo desperately misses from her youth.  I think that's the reason Alcott didn't make him a hearthrob.  He's more like a personifcation of an actual hearth.  Him being a bit older is what she needs to have that sense of being cared for in the familial way that means the most to her.  I wonder what it would be like if instead of introducing Bhaer as professorish (which he is) and young and hunkier, if it were just the very warm, snuggly, cuddly guy he is in the book, who has the exact same wisdom and unconditional love Jo got from her mother as a girl, and from her  family of origin.

The whole sister dying was jarring.  Jo cut her hair, the sister dies, Jo's hair has grown back overnight?  I'm so confused.  I spent the rest of the movie focusing on her long hair and wanted to curse at the screen.

And the boy being in ""love"" with both girls back and forth was head shaking, I didn't know what to think.  He was clearly still in love with her when the French guy showed up.

ff850z3,"I'm bummed you're being downvoted for this opinion.  I saw the 1994 version for the first time a year ago and really enjoyed it.

* Winona Ryder was an excellent Jo, but Saoirse was pretty terrific as well.  Spunky and opinionated and unafraid of anything.  The only thing that didn't really ring true was her reconsidering Laurie's offer late in the film, and her welcoming of Amy back home felt a little hollower than the 1994 version.
* Claire Danes was a believable Beth but I did really enjoy Eliza's Beth as well.
* Florence Pugh was a better Amy; I didn't detest this Amy like I had in other versions.  I felt Samantha Mathis was awfully prissy.
* Christian Bale was a great Laurie though I agree Timothee seemed younger than he was supposed to seem. Christian's metamorphosis from spoiled playboy to serious young man seemed legitimate but Timothee's seemed forced and not really explored in the least. I get that his evolution wasn't the point of the film at all and Greta was pretty clear where the focus needed to be, but I think that could have at least been detailed a little bit.
* Really enjoyed the Mr. Laurence/Beth storyline as well in this one.  
* Gabriel Byrne was a wonderful Bhaer; this actor was very good too but again, we don't get the male perspective at all, which... I get it, but he was an excellent influence and friend to Jo (seen with the Byrne version) as opposed to just an infatuated boardinghouse roommate, so to speak.
* Laura Dern was a wonderful Marmee but so was Susan Sarandon.  Tough split there.
* Emma Watson as Meg vs Trini Alvarado... I kind of lean towards Trini on this one.
* The time flip back and forth from present to past and back again was really kind of jarring.  I'm glad I knew the structure of the story because without it, I would have been lost.  There wasn't enough difference in how the girls looked 7 years ago vs present day to be able to easily tell the difference, except the short interval when Jo's hair was chopped.

I'm a little conflicted on this version.  I liked how strong the messaging of this one was with regards to women's position in society in that particular era as I think that's a critical aspect that doesn't get explored enough (and certainly wasn't the main focus of the 1994 film).  At the same time, I think Gerwig was a little overbearing with it without fully exploring how each character responded to it outside of Jo and Amy.  Meg's perspective as somewhat wealth-obsessed due to her wealthy friends was kind of glossed over, and nobody ever really asked Beth what she wanted out of life in this one.  

At any rate, thanks for sparking some thoughts on the comparison!",ef4z7u

It's one of my favorite movies, and still holds up pretty well. It's available in HD across multiple streaming services and on Blu-Ray.

The cast is also insanely stacked, including the likes of:

* Winona Ryder
* Christian Bale
* Kirsten Dunst
* Susan Sarandon
* Claire Danes

Plus, it was nominated for three Academy Awards (Actress of Ryder, Costume Design, and Original Score).

fc3tjy7,"I agree with your points. I've already read the book and watched the 1994 adaptation, so it was easy for me to follow the movie, but it must've been hard for first-time viewers to follow such non-linear storytelling.

> And ultimately, I resented the fact that Laurie settled for Amy and I am confused that Jo randomly ended up marrying the deus ex machina.

The movie pokes fun at that in a scene with Jo and her publisher. Louisa May Alcott was pressured into writing a love interest for Jo after she refused to let Jo and Laurie get married. Little Women was published in volumes, so her readership was annoyed, too. 
It's funny that people still resent the end of the story hundreds of years later.",ef4z7u
fc3n4ei,"I think in the book, what we see is that Laurie loves Jo because they have a kindred spirit. Laurie loves that he can be as he is when he is with Jo and vice versa. Though Laurie loves Jo, it may have been for the selfish reason of not wanting to grow up or change. Fast forward in time, Laurie's time with Amy in Paris helped him realizes how much more compatible he is with Amy and that their relationship brings out a desire to be a better person for her, which is something new for him, that for the first time in his life he wants to grow up and be a responsible person. What began as an overprotective sisterly love grew into something else, and both are not selfish and have another person in mind and heart. Thus, on his part, he never considered Amy as a replacement for Jo and truely loves Amy as her own person.

In the film, when Laurie tells Jo of his engagement it was conveyed in such a way that Laurie was asking Jo if that love was what the love Jo described. That scene made Laurie gave him a sense of uncertainty about whether his love or his choice is real.",ef4z7u

I agree that they could have taken more time to develop Laurie’s character more as the book does. If you haven’t read it- definitely do.

But, the way Chalamet portrayed his proposal scene to Jo was perfection in my mind. It wasn’t supposed to be dreamboat-y it was supposed to be pathetic and absolutely heart-wrenching. 

He starts it off already in that state-of-mind because he knows her, he knows her answer already and he is desperately pleading to hear a different one. I have had the somewhat unfortunate pleasure of begging someone to love me the way I loved them- it felt exactly as he played it.

I got why Gerwig went the way she did, but Jo asking Laurie if Amy preened all the way back on the boat was just so ""off"" and totally contrary to the book. I don't think Laurie/Jo HAVE chemistry, and this is the first version to really commit to that. In the book Jo is not kidding around. In the book at least, Laurie's pursuit of Jo creeped me out because she was so obviously sending him a message and he insisted on ignoring it AND when she went to NY he said something like, ""I know what you're doing and it's no good."" He was just a creeper taking advantage of her friendship for him and he practically tried to emotionally blackmail her into marriage. Not a good look. He was in no way fit to marry anybody at that time.  IMO the reason Amy and Laurie work so well is she doesn't ""pet"" him as Alcott says. Doesn't coddle him and cajole and treat him like a poor little rich boy. She's like - dude! You are a mess! Grow the hell up and stop being a brat! And he actually did (think it took a long time - a bunch of months). I did enjoy Chalamet in the scenes where he declares himself to Jo because he showed the impetuousity and the immaturity - he didn't come across as problematic.

I think Saorise Ronan is an incredible natural actress, has an obvious intelligence and handles language really well. I don't necessarily believe her in these high spirited, high energy roles in Little Women and Lady Bird (same with her in The Crucible when i saw her on stage). She is so obviously a calm temperment with a more peaceful disposition, and doesn't seem to be tapping into anything genuine when she plays these types. She's just being earnest. I also think she doesn't have the sort of inspired imagination some actress have (look at Pugh in this movie, particularly some of her line readings as young Amy). She's kind of a straight up, emotional leading lady type who because of her commitment and intelligence, puts the requisite emotion into her roles but not all that much imagination and individuality. It's all kind of same.",ef4z7u

And whatever Gerwig might say the Under The Umbrella ending is the one I choose to believe -- Jo is Alcott's character, not Alcott herself.

fc72g0b,Aunt March is stingy.,ef4z7u
fc97j7o,"Aunt March is a great Aunt (an extra generation up than we see in the movie). She ""helps"" the family by employing the girls as companions. First Jo, then Amy. In the book, Aunt March switches to Amy after Beth's illness because she likes her so much. She bribes Amy with drawing lessons from the best local teacher if Amy will be her companion instead (we're told this, not shown this).  My take is generally that Aunt March has a substantial income but maybe not enough to support a family of six in style - a whole separate household. The backstory is Mr. March and family used to be rich but he lost his fortune helping a friend. Aunt March still has hers.  Still the extent of Aunt March's wealth is unknown since she also funded Amy's entire tour to Europe (in the book Amy goes with Aunt Carroll and family, not Aunt March).",ef4z7u
fc7kzz1,The rich don't stay rich by giving away their money,ef4z7u
fcdq8oo,"Aunt march never approved of her nephews progressive political views and judged him and 
Marmee hardcore. She originally offered to adopt one of the girls when the Marches lost their fortunes while trying to help a friend, and when they refused her offer she got really offended and didn’t talk to them for awhile. After that she met Jo and employed her as a companion, and would dangle money like a carrot over them, complaining all the while about how foolish they all were and being surprised/offended when they didn’t debase themselves to get money from her. She cut Meg out of her money when she married John despite him being poor, and when mr March gets sick she only reluctantly lends the money to help him along with an “I told you this would happen” kind of note. They loved her anyways which is a testament to the marches, because she was kind of a B.

fcpc7i1,"This was Greta Gerwig's idea to have two endings--the one where we see the family gathering at the end at Plumfield and then Jo ""becoming"" Louisa May Alcott so to speak by seeing her book being published and living a single life.",ef4z7u
fcwjtc0,"I wonder if Jo's story had progressed differently post rejection of Laurie if Laurie/Jo fans would still feel the same way. Laurie sort of represents freedom and when Jo was really Jo. After she rejects Laurie, Laurie goes off to Europe and Jo nurses Beth and writes poems to her. She has no friends whatsoever, not even a no nonsense, dry witted female friend with an equally dry witted, eligible brother. Then Beth is dead and basically there's no Jo left. She's not writing, just coming to terms with shouldering her cross and hauling it up to Gethesmane. Even her sharp tongue is gone. Cue the return of the professor and Jo is happy but also gets weird.

Finally, John Brook is in the picture as Laurie's tutor before he courts Meg. We know him, he has history.  Laurie is of course, Laurie. So Meg and Amy kind of tie up nicely with people we know who are already in the story. Alcott introduces an entirely new character totally outside the beloved March/Lawrence ecosystem in Act III. No history, so it doesn't feel as satisfying.",ef4z7u

It feels like a collection of memories, maybe from Jo looking back on her life, it's out of order but it's all connected. I really enjoyed this style of filmmaking. I felt like it absorbs you into their lives (especially Jo's) in an interesting way.

I'd be curious to know more about why you thought it was phoned in. The only thing I thought was sub-par was the end with Jo falling in love with the new guy, it felt a little too convenient. But again a choice was made to keep it mostly to fun parts, and they did jam a lot of events into the movie with an already pretty long runtime.",ef4z7u

As if you were ever going to admit she did a good job.

fcn2pl5,"I know what you mean. It was like the film was 80% establishing shots, 20% plot.",ef4z7u
fcgwgmo,"IMO some of that goes to the book. Beth and Meg are pretty cardboard. Meg exists to show how resistant Jo is to the family growing up and breaking up, and how resistant to growing up herself. Beth is there to be Jo's absolute opposite and the person she loves most in the universe, then loses. There is no tension and no complexity among the sisters except as between Amy and Jo. I think if we saw a scene between Beth and Meg we'd all fall asleep.

It's funny how the book turned out because in real life, the two strongest sisters, Louisa (Jo) and May (Amy) DID live very unconventional, independent lives focused on their passions for writing and art, respectively, but also Lizzy (Beth) was not a saint, but sardonic, smart and observant, and instead of marrying a tutor the eldest Alcott daughter (forget her name) was a teacher herself. That said I hate giggly montages so thanks for the warning. Seeing this film in an hour.",ef4z7u
fibqmt5,"I felt the same way, too. I think the lack of tension and feeling of emptiness comes from the dual timelines, which I did not care for.

fc218d0,"I did not feel that Amy and Laurie’s romance was “out of the blue” as we saw it play out over the course of the entire film. VERY early we saw Amy in Paris and saw how into Laurie she was. Everything about that relationship was earned. 

As for Jo and Frederick, it was intentionally rushed. Gerwig inserted a scene of Jo arguing with the publisher telling him that Her heroine wouldn’t marry anyone. It was a meta commentary on the novel itself. We are told outright that Jo only marries because the publisher insists. We are not meant to find her courtship with the professor “believable.” 

It’s a brilliant criticism of the original novel.",ef4z7u

But I can’t deny just how thoughtful and visionary Greta Gerwig is and the casts she picks breathe unique life into her scripts. No doubt.",ef4z7u
fc23anq,"Yeah, but in comparison to other adaptations, I think they were mostly developed.

fcrba8r,"Ive never read the book and honestly I came away expecting reviews to be much harsher for the reasons you mentioned. I was largely lost through a lot of it - it felt like an attempt to hit all the main points of a larger, already known story at the expense of telling a well crafted standalone two hour narrative.",ef4z7u
fciyycn,"It's silly that you're being downvoted, you wrote an excellent critique. Personally I don't feel like Beth gives a director a lot to work with unless she wants to go full meta (as she was kind of doing with Jo already) and decides to quote some of the very few remaining letters/documents by the real Lizzie Alcott, who comes across as pretty sassy and not ready to play the Dying Swan, though unfortunately she was pulled through the veil against her will when she was 22. 

The alternate endings were kind of ... I get the sense that we're supposed to think that Jo's marriage is the dream and her singlehood is the reality, but while I loved watching it, eventually it starts, as you say, eating its own leg because where does fiction leave off and reality begin? Is Friedrich imaginary, a real guy she never actually sees again, a real guy she doesn't pursue to the train station, or what? It was definitely a weird choice to play up Jo's loneliness and have her write that letter to Laurie (which she never did in the book, once she rejected him he stayed rejected) and then be all ""LOL you're making me sell her into marriage I AM WOMAN"" etc. To be clear, I loved the movie (I wouldn't want to talk about it so much if I hadn't) but we're not so much seeing the ""real Jo"" because the real Louisa followed a very different trajectory in how Little Women was made. First, she was approached by her publisher -- it was his idea to write a girls' book, not hers. Secondly, the first volume came out in 1868 and ended with Meg's engagement. Jo's romance with Friedrich was Louisa's rebuke to the Jo/Laurie shippers who had been pestering her -- but she didn't *have* to do it. Nobody made her write Bhaer into the story, it was her choice. It does grind my gears a little to see Gerwig (who I think is great, btw) implying that singlehood is the ending Alcott would have written for Jo if she had a choice. She *did* have a choice. Granted, a single Jo would have disappointed a lot of her young fans and lost her some sales, but ultimately she could have done it and she chose not to (other characters of hers, admittedly not leads, do end their days as happy single women). You can say ""Well, she didn't want to lose sales,"" which is fine, but it's not the same thing as ""The publisher said marry her off or we're not publishing."" The book was already published and popular; it was the second volume that contained the Laurie/Amy and Friedrich/Jo romances, and Beth's death. Just as we're seeing the parts of fictional character Jo that appeal most to our current age, we're also seeing a semi-fictional Louisa -- concentrating on the parts that appeal to us, like her work ethic, her independence, and her insistence on supporting her family as a ""free spinster."" We're not shown the Louisa who *did* have serious heartburn over a man or two, who did have a reasonable amount of control over her characters and influence with her publisher by the time Little Women volume 2 appeared -- ironically, the movie shows fictional Louisa as *less* powerful than she really was at the time -- and who incidentally was anti-Irish as fuck and who was also the product of what would nowadays be seen as an abusive upbringing. (Her devotion to her father and support of him was, from my perspective, infinitely more than that asshole deserved.) I say this not to criticize her but to make it clear that neither ending is more reality-based than the other. The real Louisa never married and chose to be single -- but she also had much more control over her fictional character's fate than fictional Jo-as-Louisa, and also lived a very different and less stable life; when your main example of marriage growing up is your perpetually improvident father wandering off and doing his own thing while your mother is begging and scraping to keep the family afloat, knowing that any money she gets will be legally her husband's -- yeah, it doesn't look good. Fictional Jo is, well, fictional, and her ending can't be reality based because she didn't exist and neither did her family or her husband.",ef4z7u

fd3yti9,"If I had to guess, I’d say Gerwig was going for a more realistic take on what would happen if these characters were real people. Laurie and Amy don’t fall madly in love with each other here, there’s too much baggage.

Despite what Laurie says, I don’t think we’re meant to believe he loves Amy more than he ever loved Jo. I interpreted the Laurie and Amy dynamic as both knowing deep down that their relationship was them settling, with Laurie still wanting Jo in a perfect world and Amy wanting to be his first choice in a perfect world. Deep down they know that, that’s how they seemingly play it when they first tell Jo, but they are still able to find happiness.

I think she was going for a bittersweet interpretation where all 3 are content but not necessarily where they would want to be. Jo is successful but alone. Amy is with the man she’s loved all her life but lives with knowing she was and is second place. Laurie finds happiness and a family but will never be with the woman he loves.",ef4z7u
fd1gdlg,"I saw it for the second time and I take back my comment about Saoirse Ronan and Timothee Chalamet having no chemistry. They clearly do, and I agree with you that it was confusing. Laurie did not seem over Jo by the end of this film by having him act weirdly when the professor comes, and it kind of reaffirmed that Amy was indeed his second choice. 

Personally, I don't ship either. I wanted to see the sisters have more of a connection. Even though I liked the film, I felt that was lacking in this.",ef4z7u
fd733w3,"One thing that not a lot of people have mentioned is that Greta was looking to Louisa May Alcott's real life to fill in the blanks, as the novel is based (loosely) off parts of her life. I'm struggling to remember the details, but Alcott definitely had a romantic connection with someone who Laurie was based off of and there was something to do with her rejecting him and then regretting it.",ef4z7u
fedtphu,"I join in your feelings! I haven't written this much on something not work-related in a long time.

I just picked up the book to re-read, and there is definitely not a letter written in regret in the book. There is a scene in which Marmee tells her that Amy and Laurie are engaged and asks Jo if she is ok. Jo says she is and adds that Laurie had been writing her, and, if he had asked her again, she may have said yes, but for the wrong reasons. She talks about how she is lonely and so accepting his proposal wouldn't be good, but she had thought about it.  You know she doesn't love him, just that she misses how things were.

When he comes back, there is also a great scene where it reads like things are like they were before. She is happy for him and Amy, and happy to have her friend back. She confesses her loneliness and he tells her that she should come live with them and be aunt to any children and always feel welcome, and you believe that he is no longer in love with her, but back to some childhood affection for a sister and it is sweet. The movie just sort of ignored that and made it seem like she wanted to be with him. His whole attic scene made it look like he was trying to hurt her and made him seem childish more than anything to me.

When Laurie said that whole ""you know why"" thing to Amy about not accepting a proposal from Fred, I was just like, ""no, i don't"" and I wondered if the movie was going to reveal something, but no. There was absolutely no reason why Amy would think Laurie was in love with her. It was like they both knew she was his second choice, but they were going to be ok with it.

I think the Behr thing was just in the book and didn't actually happen in the adaptation. It was too over the top compared with what came before, and, given the ambiguity, I'd say she did not go after Behr, but went back to New York to write.

I saw the hand in pocket and thought it was adorable! I have no idea if that would have been considered normal for the period or not, but it struck me as super intimate and not in a friend way. Like, I will put my hand in my boyfriend's pocket, but not in the pocket of a friend of mine because the former is cute and the later is a bit weird, but that is just me. Jo always talks about wanting to be a boy so maybe it was something boys did? I always thought the rules of propriety with Laurie were relaxed in a way they wouldn't be with other men(Jo taking off part of her dress after the ball in front of him), so maybe it wasn't weird to them.

fcm99m5,"I JUST finished watching it and I wholeheartedly agree! I don't understand the immense praise. And I know, I know! It's an unpopular opinion but I truly think Florence Pugh was miscast as Amy. I think she's a fantastic actress and she made a wonderful adult Amy but she wasn't ever believable as a child or as a younger counterpart to Laurie. Her voice is deep and rich, not girlish so you never fully get that young whiny effect that defines Amy as a child. I really like the less bratty approach they took to the character but she just stuck out as too mature. And Timothee Chalamet's Laurie was the exact opposite. He fit as a young man but there was no discernible change to him as an adult. And there was never enough screentime with Jo to justify his young love or his proposal to her. He also never felt like part of the family. In the book, you always know Laurie is meant to be in the family in some way but you finally get that satisfaction when you see Jo's acceptance of the news of his marriage to Amy. You don't get that connection with Laurie here. 

And the non-linear telling robbed the emotional weight from the story.  My husband was so confused. He was asking why Laurie was proposing to Jo after flirting with Amy. And when Laurie showed up in the attic to talk to Jo alone, I was sure we were in a flashback but he was in the future storyline explaining that he has married Amy. I KNOW this story so I could catch up easily enough but, for someone new to the material, there was not enough visual change to differentiate between the timelines. 

There were moments to like in this movie. The more free-spirited Marmee made sense as the leader of this lively group. Streep's Aunt March was wittier. The ending was vibrant and full of joy. Gerwig crafted many truly beautiful scenes.

- I resonated so much with everything you say but particularly the above about how more difficult it is today to just make good films about good people.

Laurie is described as tall with a classical nose, etc. But after watching him I thought he exactly hewed to type. Laurie is very young. He's fifteen when he and Jo meet and maybe 22 when he marries Amy (he and Jo are 3 years older than Amy). I thought Chalamet did a great job combining Laurie's humor with his extra-ness (sensitivity, slight diva side) and his huge generosity and love for the March's. And his intelligence. I also thought he did a great job showcasing Laurie's inadvertently comical side, such as when he turned histrionic during his declaration to Jo.  AND I enjoyed his performance when you saw him trying to take meaning in his and Jo's small interactions when Jo is all ""My buddy, my pal!"" and he's like, ""we're connecting!

fc23aeu,"1. Greta didn’t really add anything to her work. Alcott was very feminist for her time.

2. I agree.

3. Their father was originally rich too. That’s why they still live in a large house next to wealthy neighbors and are invited to high society events. They are technically  “poor” but still members of the Upper class.  He loses most of his money shortly before the beginning of the story. In the movie, I think their Aunt blamed it on him teaching Freedman(freed slaves) instead of getting an adequate job to provide for his family. Meg(Emma) is the oldest and remembers when their family was wealthy more than any of her siblings. That’s why she finds it so hard to adapt to being middle/working class.

4. Meh, I thought he was fine. They look about the same age to me.

5. Fun fact about the draft, a rich man could pay a poor man to take his spot in the Union army. At least one US President did this as well as other wealthy, powerful historical figures.  I also think Laurie had the excuse of being to young for the draft and then away at Harvard. The Civil War doesn’t play a big part in the novels either. The author wrote the book based on the childhood of herself(Jo) and her three sisters. Her coming of age was the 1850s before the Civil War and I guess she didn’t want it to disrupt the story she was trying to tell despite the setting she choose.  The entire thing with “Jo” and the publisher at the end could easily have been us watching Alcott. She was forced to give Jo a husband at the end despite the fact that she personally never married. Her youngest sister was also a fairly accomplished painter like Amy. 

6. Yes, Beth was supposed to be different. She’s the stereotypical pure, innocent child character that’s destined to die young that you often see in stories written in that time. She represents “home” which is why she’s a shy homebody fond of domestic duties.",ef4z7u

3) see above comment. Aunt March is the girls’ great-aunt. 

5). That’s entirely on the book. Only a few sentences on it. Seemed weirdly lacking in the book as well.

>1. I have never read this book, and though I'm pretty sure I saw the 1990s adaptation I don't remember it very well. With that said, I feel like you really need some context for this movie. There were a few blatant ""girl-power"" type statements in the movie which made me questions whether Alcott was very ahead of her time but subtle, in the same way as Austen is, or if that was Gerwig updating/editorializing. I think it would be more enjoyable if I had read the book beforehand so that I could appreciate the changes, and also have some clue about which ending is the book ending and which one is the one that Gerwig has crafted.

Greta heavily modernized the dialogue from the book and admitted to doing so in interviews. She also admitted to pulling dialogue from other Alcott works and modern interpretations of those works. As someone who studied American English Lit and Alcott's work specifically, this film totally missed the mark. It was a slap in the face. It was a terrible adaptation and one of worst ever done. Its not a shock that she didn't get a golden globe nomination.",ef4z7u

I thought she did great here, and has a fair few other good performances (Perks, Bling Ring, Colonia).  

""so it provides an unnecessary distraction from Ronan's excellent Jo."" - You honestly just sound like a disgruntled Saoirse stan here; she's a great actress and the best in the film, but she's already the main focus of the film and the consensus is she did a great job, as it is with the rest of the cast.

Because of the non-linear we didn’t get to see their characters develop as they aged. We didn’t get to see long-held feeling at the moment they were revealed.

I was also shocked that I didn’t cry. But why should we care so much about Beth dying when we didn’t get a chance to really know her? Why should we weep at the romance of Jo and Fredrich when we don’t learn a single thing about him except simply he’s an immigrant - they could have at least told from where!  In the novel we learn his heart and what makes him tick, we see he and Jo bond over beautiful poetry and opera. Because they decided to leave out Fredrich, the ending felt so very lame.

He's not young or handsome but unlike some takes he's a true intellect and a bundle of total affection and love.  He does dislike Jo's sensational stories but since he gave her her first volume of Shakespeare we can see where he's coming from. Bhaer is not going to appeal to romantic young women in the book, but he's not stern. He's a big teddy bear.

I won't see the movie til Sunday but I read a piece where two writers pretended to have two different takes on the ending. One writer says Jo marries Bhaer, the other took her final conversation with Dashwood as saying she didn't. That's where the meta comes in in the movie.

AND there are aspects of Jo's character left undeveloped in service of the tomboy  and temper thing, aspects that are important as to how she ends up. I think the structure of this sounds promising as when the story is told chronologically on camera there's not enough time to develop the choices made by the characters.

He's early 20s when he marries Amy, and looks it, so that works. Best of all it puts the Jo/Laurie stuff in perspective. Not a heartbreaking romantic tragedy but crossed signals between two best friends. One has been unable to see the other person clearly (Laurie to Jo) and her signals, and the other has been dreading the moment because she knows it changes everything. There's humor in the scene too as the audience sees Laurie's histrionics and emotional blackmail, (""We'll make our families happy!"") and Jo trying to comfort the person she has just hurt, feeling guilty and responsible. It's very young, as it should be.  Chalamet also helps with Laurie's dissipation in Europe as you're seeing someone who is plausibly still quite young.",ef4z7u

fcn6bha,"I think the sum is less than the whole, but the acting is very strong. It's really brilliantly cast with the exception, IMO of the stunt casting of Meryl Streep, who is just doing Meryl Streep schtick.  Gerwig's weakness is narrative coherence and especially narrative consistency. Here she's relying on familiar source material as well as audience familiarity with previous films, so that kind of helps let her off the hook. Another strength is character development. She really nailed all of these characters - blew through the surface stuff and got back to what really defined them when they were young. Jo wasn't just a tomboy - she was a girl who hated to say good'by to childhood. She ""got"" the Laurie/Jo relationship, the Amy/Laurie relationship, and she ""got"" Marmie and Hannah perfectly. And Beth. The only thing she distorted was the Jo/Amy relationship as she kept Jo's disdain for Amy going through to adulthood, and that's not true to the source. I'd have been happier if clearer reasons for this were established - i.e., Amy was happy to grow up, Amy's ambitions, temperment and inclinations helped her integrate more smoothly into conventional society while Jo struggled. Amy herself was unconventional but because she knew how to handle herself it didn't ""stick out"" as it did with Jo. I could see someone struggling as much as Jo struggled being envious of somebody who was better suited for the world they occupied - but anyway, Gerwig didn't do that.  I did find the actual storytelling a great big mess, and she'd throw themes in there at the last minute without establishing them first. Similar to how Ladybird suddenly did this nostalgia and appreciation for Sacramento without ever establishing that as a core theme of that film. So I have agree with you. Agree about story and narrative, disagree about being dull or not worth seeing.",ef4z7u

More of the plus side is we could see Beth's intelligence and inner life. We could see the ""normal"" girl in her who WAS special, a good girl with integrity, not some clueless mindless saint who didn't perceive the world around her. Her inner life was going on all the time - even her speech to Mr. Laurence accepting the use of the piano and then retreating. She made a DECISION to speak, because its importance (accepting the offer, and thanking Mr. Laurence) overrode her shyness. It wasn't some ultra dramatic, halting, poor Beth she may faint type moment. She owned her decision to speak up, and got it out.

Before we see Jo run to catch the professor at the station and kiss him, we see her in her publishers office. She tells him her protagonist doesn't marry anyone, not the neighbor or the professor.

If you read the screenplay that was recently made available, the scene where Jo goes to kiss the professor as well as the scene where she's opened the school and is with him along with all the other couples is labelled with: 'Fiction (?)' It's almost meant to be a parody of all those fairytale romantic endings.

In the book, Jo gives up writing, starts the school and marries the professor. In reality, Louisa May Alcott carried on writing, bought her copyright so she could write sequels and didn't marry or have children. Gerwig has written a meta ending that can be left up to one's own interpretation. Jo is almost Louisa herself there, agreeing to marry Jo off. It's a commentary on the pressures she would have been under at the time, by writing stories about women. And the final thing we see is Jo embracing her book, not a man.",ef4z7u

The last third, IMO, is typical of 1800s books where the author is rebellious in the first half and then bangs the gong of Christianity and sorts everyone into their ""correct"" gender roles in the last bits.  The movies always try to youngify Bhaer and sex him up a bit, but in the book he's an aptly-named cuddly comfortable mid-life big brain. I recently re-read Little Women  - hadn't since I was a kid - and was absolutely stunned that Jo had a bunch of babies at the end. I knew she did, but was still appalled. In real life, not only did Louisa May Alcott not get married and become a literary sensation instead, but her sister May, upon whom Amy was based, wrote a book of advice about how single women with artistic interests and aspirations could further their artistic education in Europe despite having very little money. AND May exhibited in Paris. AND taught art back at home. My take is the publisher made Louisa make both female sisters ""grow up"" by giving up their independent ambitions and finding fulfilment in family life instead. Alcott wrote about the  girls she knew in the first half, and in the second half had to make them conventional. If Alcott had a realistic second half probably Amy would have married a free-spirited glamorous bohemian type and Jo would have met a soulful woman who reminded her of Beth and they'd have had a Boston marriage.",ef4z7u
fc9yjcq,"I mean, Gerwig still added a layer of ambiguity of whether Jo marries Bhaer or not by adding a meta aspect of the ending.",ef4z7u
fcbkzgi,"I think it's left somewhat ambiguous, leaning towards no marriage in my view. The scene where she ends up going after Frederick and kissing him is inter-cut with the meta scene with the publisher who tells Jo to change the ending of her book so that the main character ends up married instead. Jo resists at first stating that the right ending for the character (remember the book is based on their lives) would be to end up marrying neither of them. But eventually concedes to change the ending. We also never really see Frederick after this if I remember correctly. Is he in the scene at the party near the end (possibly Marmie's birthday)? I can't remember.

Also the ending shot of her reaction as her book is being printed is a bit bittersweet where she start outs ecstatic, but then turns to sadness and then finally breaking into a bittersweet smirk, suggesting that she may still be lonely.

In addition, I forget if the scene where she chases after Frederick has a warmer tone to it or not, but all of the ""flashback"" scenes have a warm tone and color palette versus the colder, bluer color palette of the ""present"" day scenes. If the scene with Frederick is actually in a warmer tone, you could potentially view all of the ""flashback"" scenes as representations of the book she writes, not actual flashbacks. Though since the book is based on her real life, they would be nearly the same anyway save for the major difference in the ending. Just speculation though as I don't remember that scene properly. The party scene ending with the sisters crowding Marmie may have also been in that warmer tone.",ef4z7u

The girls do anything they want - draw on the walls, run around with hot pokers - it's almost like a commune with the free reign they were given.

Gerwig got to the heart of pretty much every character.

And you can see it when she's helping the vets when she takes off her scarf. Lots of times she's kind of played like a grown up Beth - this natural saint.

Jo wouldn't have written passionately or livingly about their relationship in her book as she was not only an outsider, she also found herself in an awkward position not knowing for sure whether she'd loved Laurie all her life.

Jo never called him out like that from what I recall, but Amy certainly did, and I think that sparked something in him.

She was supposed to have her own life at this point. Everybody else did.  She's experiencing that pain of wanting, basically, to have stayed home forever, but home changed and everyone moved on but her. She'd hit a dead end. In this low point, the existence of Frederick Bhaer, who practically walks around with a homey fireplace trailing him, some rambunctious and appealing nephews, a charitable nature (at Xmas EVERYBODY in the boarding house gets something from him, even though he's poor himself, just as Jo's parents would have done) and a love of reading and family that evoke Jo's parents, kind of comes across as the person who is going to restore what Jo lost. Which is what she wants. I don't think she really wants to be a regular grown up in a regular house with a regular spouse. She wants the restoration of what she lost. In the person of Frederick Bhaer, she gets the best of both worlds (well, inheriting Plumfield helped) It's interesting (in the book) that Laurie's immediate reaction is of course Jo will sell Plumfield and get a good price for it, while Jo announces she wants to do her boys school. Laurie finds this a great joke and in no way is able to take it seriously. The others are more supportive.

Jo's situation is very poignant but IMO the fundamental problem was she had to leave NY, where she was beginning to thrive, and come back ""home"" where she was faced every day with the reality that it no longer existed in the form she'd wanted it to remain in forever.",ef4z7u

Bhaer is never going to be a hearthrob but in the context of when he appears he's like the one shining warm point in Jo's life, the one comfort she has. She can never be sad or melancholy around him. Of course we get the signs of things to come when she sneaks into his room to darn his damn socks and sew his buttons (the book really does come all over conventional gender roles AND religion towards the end). Little Women spends a lot of time on Bhaer, and while it's never, ""Gee, I wish there were more men like Bhaer around today!"" he is very clearly the one refuge in her life as her world constricts, gets bleaker and more depressing. He lightens the mood, he's seldom melancholy, he's a positive thinker always moving forward, and he opens up the world of classical literature to Jo in a way it's never been shown to her before.  He's also very family oriented and family-supportive (his nephews).

If they were just seeing the performance fairly, anyone could see it was a great job, and definitely not something she ""didn't spend much time on"" like you fucking say here.

Also, the accent was perfectly fine here and no one would even notice accents if they didn't know what she sounded like. Saoirse Ronan's accent slipped just as much (and was also perfectly fine) but no one talks about because 1) they don't know her actual voice, so it's pretty much unnoticable for most if it slips, and 2) because unlike with Emma, they like her, while with Emma she's just a punching bag for some people.

Fucking Christ, anybody who is being even \*remotely\* fair here could see how much she got Meg's character and the warmth she brought to the character. God, you seem like a jerk. The only reason you (and anyone else) even pick on her here is because you always hated her and you were because of your bias just gonna see her negatively here no matter how well she did, because she did a great job here. If you didn't know who the actor was and just saw the performance, anyone could see it was a great performance and was perfectly on par with the rest of the cast. Maybe you could say Florence and Saoirse were the stand-outs here, but that doesn't mean she was some kind of weak link. She did as good as pretty much anyone else here, and people just hate on her because she's a punching bag for them. Anyone who saw this remotely fairly, even people who I'd seen dislike her in the past, could admit she did great in this role. So fuck off with that ""she didn't even try"" shit. Like, what the hell could she have done to impress you if this performance can't get you to give her just credit.

Also, she has had plenty of great performances in other films as well, so ""she is not a good actor"" is objectively wrong, both here and in a number of other movies. I bet you only saw BatB and judged her based on that (which I thought could have been better based on how she did in LW, but it was still fine) and even if you did see anything else it's not like you were ever going to admit she good because that's just the preconception you have of her.",ef4z7u

The other girls were worried about other things while their mother was gone, but that was the one thing that didn’t somehow include their own family that Marmee asked them to do and Beth was the one who did it, even if she had to go alone. 

That one scene hit it all home for me. Beth was completely selfless and the most caring of the group. You can also see that in the Christmas scene when she says something to the effect of all she wants is for them to be together and the care she takes in making the slippers.",ef4z7u

THANK YOU!  I just posted my complaint about this... I feel that the appearance of the father character basically threw me off the entire timeline switches from that point forward.

fc27pgl,"Hmm, Florence was very good but I agree with another comment that stated that she was given the most crowdpleasing role with the best lines. She also had the most to work with in terms of range because she was playing such wildly different ages from a young teen to a woman, whereas the other actors had to try and convey more subtle shades of aging and maturity. Ronan has to be angry, irritable, stubborn and standoffish and still make the audience root for Jo. I think that's a harder job. 

Likewise, Laurie is a hard role to play. In one moment he has to be boyish and smitten, the next heartbroken and sullen, the next a bit of a trainwreck, the next convincingly pulling himself together enough to be wanting to start a life with Amy. Chalamet pulls it all off so seamlessly, while not having his character be as developed on the page as Jo or Amy for obvious reasons. In his scenes with Florence, my eyes would be immediately drawn to how he was holding himself or sitting or lying. It's actually a pretty intricate and fascinating performance.",ef4z7u
fcm8wm4,"People also can't help but compare and say she was bad because a lot of them have always had a bone to pick with her, and basically think of her as a usual target for their dislike in movies and that will generally colour how they critique her performance here.

fc4hck1,Oh on the contrary I find her character very interesting the older I get and now as a wife and a mom. The scene with her and her husband after she bought the fabric and expressed frustration at their circumstance (despite her immense love for him) made me cry. I understood her so much and I felt equally strong for him in that moment. Heartbreaking.That’s what being an adult is. She feels like the only sister that actually has to be an adult in the movie and that childhood to adulthood transition is really simultaneously wonderful and sad and frustrating. As a child I found meg boring and too perfect but that character in my opinion has the most depth. It’s just more subtle.,ef4z7u

That's the answer to ""how do we know""? We DO know.

I agree with OP. IMO even Gerwig cheated and pandered to the audience by making Frederick a hearthrob. That says she's positive the audience won't understand the match unless he's hot. In the book he pretty much opens the door to a new life for her that suits her down to a tee. The movie only touches on this before backing up. There's freedom of discussion on all sorts of topics instead of ""society"" topics. There's direct and frank conversation among men and women. Frederick is also from a similar moral and religious grounding as Jo so even when they're among free thinkers he has a reassuring way of validating her core beliefs. Jo wouldn't know what to do with a ""hunk"" or a conventional guy. I thought the ending came out of nowhere in order to be meta and wasn't earned.",ef4z7u

Here, we are told in the first ten minutes that Jo has rejected Laurie's proposal and we don't see it happen for another hour or so. We know it's coming and so we can never get fully invested in them.

I think Amy has suffered from most of the adaptations casting an adult actress in the role who can't always play that young convincingly, so her spite at Jo for not taking her to the play ends up looking less like a frustrated, bratty preteen and more like a blooming sociopath. It's impossible to imagine even a fifteen year old Amy doing that. But I think most honest readers will see that there's at least a bit of Amy in them -- and that's not a bad thing.

I also don't think Amy was ""badass"" for burning her sister's book. That was really cruel and it doesn't have the impact it did for me when I read the book. I didn't hate her for it because she was a child, but I also felt really sad for Jo. In this film, I didn't care much.",ef4z7u

fc7hfyp,"Since the last time I read the book was about twenty years ago, I have to lean on the film and its interpretation more. However, your response and your references of the book are refreshing. 

Yes, I do agree that both the film and the book Jo never loved Laurie “romantically”. I don’t think Jo had a mature sense of love at that point, since she was consciously rejecting the notion of marriage all throughout her youth. Furthermore, she was young and ambitious to be on her own and to become self complete. Beyond the repulse Jo had toward being a wife, Laurie was a representation of her incomplete self, she probably felt that if they were together she will forever be incomplete. This is probably the real reason Jo pushed away the idea of Laurie and zoned him forever as a friend.

Fast forward to after Beth’s death, Jo had grown. Though she had partially fulfilled her ambition by then, her growth came from the losses she experienced in life, the struggles to make it on her own, and all the people she had met and saw. In other words, she saw the world. I think that informed her how rare and how special it is to be loved by a close friend. Furthermore, she probably realized how importance it is to have a constant source of love in her life and that can only come from a husband. I wouldn’t be surprised if she had also observed how many different forms of love that bring people together and worked. So she might’ve gained a new appreciation of what Laurie can be and became open. Though this openness is something practical than romantic, it showed Jo was willing to put her ideals aside as a sign of growth. 

In a time of extreme loneliness and loss, Laurie is also a remnant of her past and family she can keep. Hence, retreating to the past became tempting.",ef4z7u

fch19ah,"Frederich is also important because, as the 2017 version show runner said, Jo and Laurie are NOT right, and Amy and Laurie are. If a movie is going to show that Amy and Laurie are (for once!), then it also has to show why she loves Frederich so strongly. She respects the hell out of him, he opens the world up to her for the first time - shows her a society of people who talk about the stuff that REALLY interests her instead of nonsense, she goes to dinner parties where this happens, he creates a home environment in the boarding house so NYC becomes a cozy place and a new idea of home, and he brings her the comfort and security Jo desperately needs. Jo loved BETH, practically a saint. That tells us something about Jo. Frederich is also truly to the bone good, but also funny and strong. We need to see and feel that's what Jo needs so some can see, ok, that's why her playmate from her teen years wouldn't have made the right husband.",ef4z7u

fedrh2s,"You confirmed my thoughts. I was wondering if someone unfamiliar with the story would be a little confused and it seemed to be the case.

Amy with the book! You can't come back from something like that.

Laurie's love for Jo makes sense to me, even if you look at it like it was a childhood infatuation. His love for Amy always just seems to come out of nowhere. The 1994 adaptation has him telling Amy that he hates all the  men that the March girls love and just really wants to a part of the family, which is weird, but really is the only explanation for things. Like, ""Meg's married, Jo said no, and Beth is dead so on to Amy, I suppose.""",ef4z7u
fedsfip,"I'm so happy that I am not alone! I was yelling this at a friend and they didn't seem to understand why I get so upset at the whole thing.

I have heard other theories on the letter. One was that she felt overwhelmed by her small world and saw a life with Laurie as comfortable with someone she did love, even if it wasn't in a romantic way.

Another idea, fueled by the small flashback she has to childhood with him as she is destroying the note, is that the letter is her way of trying to capture her childhood back. She was so happy and now Beth is gone and Meg married. Laurie took off and she thinks, ""well, maybe I don't love him in that way but if I marry him at least we can go back to how things were and be happy with each other again."" Of course, that's not how life works.

I just don't think I will believe that she didn't love him though, and the letter was her way. She was a little older and had time to reflect. The whole exchange with Marmee made me think that Jo was actually in love and Marmee was too narrowly construing what love was.

Then, like you, I look at the movie and it's like, ""lets make it so it looks like she is in love with Behr"" when, in fact, we have seen him for roughly 2 minutes prior and one of those was him criticizing her. I know Louisa May Alcott was forced into providing a marriage for Jo and would not allow it to be Laurie, but it would have made sense to me for Jo to write how much she misses Laurie to Amy, who would have relayed that to him, and have him return and try again, less forcefully.

I’m sure it’s different in the book/other films, but I’m already invested in Laurie/Jo because of their chemistry throughout. All we got of Laurie/Amy was a one-sided love until and he decides to “cockblock” Fred Vaughn(?). If it followed the traditional love triangle arc, he would have ended up with Jo instead. (I’m aware this is not a romcom - it couldn’t be anything further from a romcom. So why structure it like one?!)

There's a bunch of Laurie/Amy hints even before Laurie declares to Jo, as Alcott describes the relationships as he ""flirted with Amy, joked with Jo, something something with Beth."" of course it wasn't serious at the time. A Laurie/Jo discussion also kicks off when he mentions one of his classmates is really getting ""desperate"" about Amy and they should shut that down (on the classmate's side) with a quickness.

If it had been linear, each scene would have had to move the plot along as well as convey the message the story wanted to convey. With the nonlinear story, the flashbacks only need to convey the message and don't have to move time forward. 

For example, instead of seeing Beth get sick the first time in a linear story, we see Beth's first illness only as flashbacks when she is sick the second time to explain that Jo thinks Beth may get better. 

Another example - we don't need to understand the timeline of Mr. Laurence's friendship with Beth. We just know there was mutual affection and so his reaction to her death makes sense.",ef4z7u

The film circles online (such as here) have a real negativity surrounding her, and I don't see how it would be unreasonable to state that that's gonna colour how they view her here, especially when she's surrounded by other acclaimed actors and a lot of the time people seem to ignore that has had a fair number of good performances.

Now with this specifically, the critical consensus has generally been she had a very good performance here, although with a somewhat less prominent role. I agree with that, and would call it one of her best performances and think that she handled the role very well; but my point was that regardless of the truth of how well she did here, she was predictably gonna be put down by a sum of people because, naturally, people adhere to their preconceptions. She's a ""whipping boy"" to a lot of people and a lot of them tend to want to tease just how bad they consider her to be because it's a joke for a lot of them. For a fair number of the critical pieces of her performances, it felt like they were scrutinizing her in just a different way that didn't reflect how she actually did, and seemed unwilling to credit her for a good performance.

So no, I don't think I was being ""unfair"" or ""misleading"" by saying a lot of people were gonna say she was bad when they effectively went in the preconception that she would be bad, especially with her co-stars here.",ef4z7u

I didn't feel any chemistry between them. It becomes more of a love story about Amy and Laurie, which I enjoyed and thought was the only cohesive thing about the film. However, the other parts of the film I didn't care for.

Florence Pugh was great. However, I do feel like this film went out of its way to make Amy the most sympathetic sister and also gave her a lot of crowdpleasing dialogue, such as her speech about marriage being economical. She was given a clear trajectory in her story that the others were not. 

Saoirse is a great actress. I just didn't love Jo in this as much as I usually do nor did I care for her arc. I think it had more to do with the writing than her actual performance. I just wasn't into her character progression and wasn't fond of the alternating endings.

There may be a few tears over Beth or a couple of other things, but it's not depressing. On the whole, it's a very comforting movie. Instead of being 100% escapism and artificial, it's sort of idealistic in how it looks (it's beautiful) and sounds, there's lots of love in it, not just romantic love, and you get to escape into the lives of these girls and the world they inhabit, so there's this feeling of comfort and continuity. Everybody in it is very kind and understanding, just the sort of people who'd comfort you in circumstances like yours. There's DEFINITELY a major continuity challenge which is a distraction in itself. And, Florence Pugh (Amy) is absolutely hilarious as kid Amy.

I feel like if I were still in college and an English major (back when I was young and dinosaurs roamed the earth) this would make an interesting comparison with Pride and Prejudice. I think the March sisters pair up nicely with the Bennetts. Obviously (respectable) careers weren't available to women of Austen's time but the characters and the feel of the stories seem to share a certain kinship.

Maybe my thought on the Civil War is based on the fact that a lot of the things we know about the Civil War are based on the hardship suffered by the civilians in the south (Gone With the Wind, Cold Mountain, Free State of Jones), but since the fighting never really touched anything farther north than Pennsylvania maybe the civilian hardships were not such a concern for northern-based writers. The movie has them in Concord -- whether MA or NH, I'm not sure, but I think the Alcotts were part of the transcendentalist writers set in the mid-1800s so I'm guessing MA.

And then later you try to organize another get-together with the same people at the same place to recreate that amazing time, but half the people can't make it, or the music's not the same, or something... It's just not the same, it feels hollow. It just gives you such a weird feeling of loneliness, and you'll keep anything ANYTHING from that perfect moment just to maybe feel a bit of that greatness again.

I've felt it so many times in my life, but it's difficult to describe and I've always wondered if other people experience this specific type of loneliness, because people never seem to have a hard time moving on. This movie convinces me that other people do, because I see it in Jo all throughout the movie.",ef4z7u

Interestingly, Scarlet Fever can indeed lead to rheumatic heart disease and eventual heart failure and death years later, even when one has apparently “recovered” from the initial disease.  It’s the same bacterium that causes Strep throat, and that’s the primary reason we try to ensure Strep throat is always treated with antibiotics—not because the pharyngitis is particularly dangerous, but because we want to prevent cases of rheumatic fever.  

You almost never see rheumatic fever in the developed world these days, but it’s a common medical exam question topic, wherein a young, previously healthy immigrant from a less developed country presents with symptoms of heart failure, and you find they had untreated Strep throat or scarlet fever as a child.",ef4z7u

The story beat about Meg wanting that fabric to make a dress only highlights how she constantly put others ahead of herself. It also highlights how human she is and the dreams she is giving up everyday. Yet, Meg is rational enough to know the vanity of the former and the substantial sustenance of the latter. Both Meg and the role of Meg are thankless but required.

I did appreciate though that Ronan especially had minimal makeup here, I could see the texture of her skin and her natural eyelashes, which is a refreshing change from most period films.

fejxjy6,"Agreed! 

After seeing the new one, I watched the 94 version.  There are things about both I really like.  

Amy needs to be two different actresses.  So much changes between 12 and 20, physically and emotionally.  I loved Pugh as adult Amy.  I also loved Chalamet as young Teddy.  But you're right that Bale managed to do youthful and cynical both very well.  Someone said they only tried to convey his she with facial hair, and I disagree.  The facial hair was only a symptom of his playboy time period after being rejected by Jo.  If I remember correctly, it's gone when he comes back from trying to make himself worthy of Amy.

fc9ny1g,"Amy didn't luck into anything. In the book it's obvious she is every bit as strong and talented and courageous as Jo. Jo sabotaged her own chances of going to Europe. Nobody wants to give someone an opportunity like that and find out they're unappreciative, ungrateful, unwilling to prepare for it, and disdainful of effort. Amy had to drag Jo to pay a visit to Aunt March and Aunt Carroll, because they were dressed up and Amy thought they'd appreciate the compliment of a formal visit from their neices. Jo wanted to blow it off - Aunt March gave her a pain.  During the visit Jo said she detested the French language (silly slippery language), hated favors because she hated being obligated to others, and was overall obnoxious and clearly chafed at being in the company of these women. Amy was polite, and appreciative that Aunt March still let her speak to her French maid to improve her language. This was the visit that changed the aunts' minds from taking Jo to taking Amy, as they spelled out in their letter to Marmee. They'd wanted to take Jo but since she ""hates French"" ""hates favors"" and otherwise acted like she didn't want to be obligated to anybody, they figured Amy would appreciate it more.

Amy is aesthetics and Jo is drama. People seem to think Amy is polite because she's manipulative but there's absolutely no evidence of that in the book at all. She appreciates tact, manners and good taste - that's her nature. Greta Gerwig says that Amy saying she's not wise but ""observant"" is key. Jo can't read a room and gets in her own way. Amy is much more considerate and respectful of others. Long before the trip to Europe it's clear Amy is popular with men and women. The episode at the fair shows why. She took her demotion with good grace, and after Jo ordered Laurie and his friends to save the day, Amy instructed them to be fair and do the same to the person who had humiliated her, since she hated being petty and tacky and wanted to be a ""gentlewoman."" Jo could have gone to Europe. Jo could have married Laurie. That she didn't do either was her decision and choice.",ef4z7u
fckbasa,"There are plenty of things that have been successful and then their sequels haven't for various reasons. Considering the first part of Little Women ended when their father comes home for Christmas, there was no pressure to have them romantically paired off as young teens. Doesn't mean there wouldn't have been pressure to do so for them as adults.

Friedrich has been hot and younger in other adaptations, including 1933. It's really only 1994 that cast a far older guy and yes, I think most people made it clear that they didn't understand why Jo would go for someone like that. Gerwig is doing the pairing a favor by making them as easy to like as possible (same with Laurie and Amy). Also, why is it an issue for Friedrich to be hot but not an issue for Jo - who is described as homely - to be played by the distinctively beautiful Saoirse Ronan (and before her Winona Ryder and Katherine Hepburn). If female characters must always be played by beautiful women, then there's nothing wrong with a female director determining that the men should be attractive too.",ef4z7u
fc3w9ce,"Agreed! I felt like it really emphasized the poignancy of the film's interests and themes. It deepens the pain and frustration of their adult difficulties by contrasting them with their memories of childhood. It becomes so much a film about our memories and the stories we tell about ourselves. Moving back and forth really emphasizes the contrasting areas of continuity and growth for the characters as well, how they change, where they stubbornly stay the same. 

I know some people feel like it negatively reduced dramatic tension for some key scenes like the proposal, but I disagree there. That scene was beautifully handled, it felt like something they all knew had to happen even in the moment, an inevitability, but a painful one. Jo immediately tries to shut Laurie down, she knows where it's going, and the fact we know he gets rejected doesn't dampen the pain of the scene, for me it heightens it. The tension was so high, it was something we knew was coming, she knew was coming, but it's no less painful for being expected, and the waiting is rough. Plus, this structure allows that moment of high tension and emotion to be placed at the climax where it belongs. 

I think it also greatly helps with her romance with Bhaer. Rather than being some random new guy we're introduced to after our preferred pairing has been dashed, here he's the first guy we see with her—we see them dancing, having fun, connecting. It makes their eventual coming back together feel very natural and satisfying. I think the structure added to and was suited to the story in so many ways!",ef4z7u

 What you consider an average film is probably very different to me. I consider the avengers franchise to be very poor, but films like Joker to be a cut above them as just being relatively average. Reddit's general opinion is that these films are 8/10 lol. I mainly watch foreign film now and occasionally check in with westerns, I love Little Women so gave it a go.",ef4z7u
fcim1cs,"My favorite Jo/Amy scenes in the book are the social calls chapter and the ""fair"" chapter. Social calls feature Jo being perverse as a guest, but perfectly respectful to Amy, as she sees this whole thing as Amy's area of expertise, no shade. You can see how smart, funny and strong both are. AND it features Jo bragging on Amy's ballsy and unconventional horseback riding abilities and willpower. And the other is when Amy is screwed over at a fundraising fair - kicked off the ""best"" table (the art table) and onto the flower table, and Jo rounds up Laurie and all his friends who swarm the flower table and buy everything. They're a really good ying and yang once they're grown up.",ef4z7u
fc9c6zl,">In a time of extreme loneliness and loss, Laurie is also a remnant of her past and family she can keep. Hence, retreating to the past became tempting.

Absolutely. Another factor - in the book, Beth is the great love of Jo's life. Obviously, not all loves are romantic. But despite Jo's obsession with Beth, IMO the Beth character and that relationship does not register viscerally the way Laurie as a character registers. Towards the end of the book, Beth is gone, but Laurie remains and, as you say, is the remnant of her past she can keep. IMO the problem with Jo's circumstances is Jo starts a new life in New York that is as exciting as Europe in its own way, and the boarding house where she lives gives her that comforting family vibe, and she's thinking in new ways, and maturing, thanks to the professor. But then she has to go back home to care for Beth (after taking Beth to the seaside again) and it's like she loses both her old life and her new life.

A kind of comical part of the book is in the first half Jo can't stand John Brook (totally agree with her) and would prefer Meg marry Laurie (as a kid, that was my preference too). Then before Beth confirms to Jo that she's dying, Jo thinks Beth is pining for/in love with Laurie and is all set to MAKE Laurie love Beth. This comes out, and Beth is like, oh no no no, I'm sad cause I'm dying, not in love. I love Laurie like a brother, and hope he will be truly my brother some day.

Jo's like - not through me he won't. And Beth is - but I thought you loved him dearly! Jo's like - I do but not like that. Oh well, Amy's left for him and they'd be perfect together but count me out. 

So in the book, Jo at different points thinks Laurie would be great with each of her sisters.  IMO the book reads overly sad at the end because in real life I don't think a woman of Jo's energies, talents, work ethic and independence would be hanging at home at 25 like, ""Whoops, I forgot to get married and now I'm sad!"" New York was still there and Boston was even closer. Maybe in concord or whereever the LW town was a 25 year old living at home was doomed to be a ""spinster"" but it was a bit weird Jo stuck herself there after she proved she could thrive in NYC.",ef4z7u

fchl0se,"Yes, we really needed to see more of him than what we got -- a book reader can sort of fill in the background mentally but all a movie-only viewer is going to see is him telling her her stories aren't that great and giving her the Shakespeare that the movie never told us she'd been wanting for a long time. It makes him feel more tacked on in the ""publisher made her do it"" sense, and I get that's the plotline Gerwig was going for and it worked in the movie, but it's not ""realer"" than the book Alcott actually wrote, and it does distort what she did in volume 2 where Friedrich is a presence throughout and Jo has spent a lot of time getting to know and respect him and, as you said, have her world expanded by him, instead of him being a tacked-on happy ending. (And in the speech Jo gives Laurie about how she doesn't think she'll ever marry, in the books she adds that if she does marry, he'll be able to deal with it and they'll both be better off -- she's not discounting the possibility altogether.)

In real life Alcott had the copyright after publishing volume 1 and could have chosen to keep Jo single in volume 2 had she really wanted -- Friedrich was basically her rebuke to all the Jo/Laurie shippers who were writing to her and begging her to have them get together.",ef4z7u

One was Jo's ""real"" ending (her watching her book be made) and the other was the book ending (running after Baehr).  Which, I like better for THIS movie, since we got none of the relationship development for Jo and Baehr. 

But the scene at the end doesnt match, since Baehr is there at the school and that implies that he is her match.  

The fact that Jo and Laurie dont end up together after all that, just breaks my heart.  I do need to reread the book, as it's been a long time.  This movie was the first time I could kind of feel Jo made the right choice, but only until she writes that letter.",ef4z7u

Though his grandfather means well, wanting to imbue him with the education and character for him to have a good life, it only isolated him even the more. Jo’s rejection will not only estranged him from her but also of her family since Jo really was the joint between the two. Thus, he’ll probably do or say anything to maintain his only place that makes him happy. All the more, this made him afraid and blind in his decisions. Neither has he gotten the life and experience to know the meaning of being a good man. “I’ll be a saint” is both idealistic, wishful, and without definition. His idea of being a saint probably means just being nice. It doesn’t require growing up. Jo and the Marches is at best a home, but at worst is Neverland to Laurie, and Laurie needs his own journey to find purpose and to know something good requires someone good to nurture and maintain it.",ef4z7u

I don’t remember Beth a lot from the book, but Danes in the 1994 movie really made an impression on me. Ryder and her were such a good pair, their bond was one of the most touching part of the movie. Aside from the nice scene on the beach, I feel it was missing in this version.

By the way, I actually liked Emma Watson, and in retrospect, I’m a bit angry at the critics who were mocking her performance: it’s not showy but she’s a good Meg (as a non-native English speaker, I’m not bothered by accents, tho). But the character is still not very interesting.",ef4z7u

Agree Ronan is more Jo from the book but I think Chalamet's proposal scene was much more emotionally heartbreaking, though for different reasons. I feel for him so much more than Bale's Laurie. It's a different portrayal and I think you're right that the older version heightened the will they/won't they tension more because it was chronological so my disappointment was romantic in nature. In the 2019 version my heart broke for their friendship and unrequited love because of Chalamet's complete devastation and already seeing in flash forwards they no longer kept in touch. 😭 Maybe it's my age and the 2019 version telling the story as adults reminiscing,  but that, losing a close friend, to me is a lot more sad.",ef4z7u

What’s lovely about adaptation is that we get to see material we’ve seen before through the eyes of another artist. If someone isn’t coming at the material with a strong point of view or with something meaningful to say, why bother adapting it? Especially when it comes to a canonical work like **Little Women**. 

This is Greta Gerwig’s **Little Women**. If you don’t care what she thinks, there’s really no reason to watch it. There are no shortage of other versions.

She gets to know him over the course of a year, and when he visits it isn't just a brief appearance to announce that he's going west, cue race to the train station. I'd need to reread the book again but I'm pretty sure he was there for a few weeks at least and ""Under The Umbrella"" was Jo looking for him at the shops. Sure, he was planning to head west, but there wasn't a ticking clock or a race. 

Plumfield was an odd loose end that more runtime might have solved. Aunt March is just so unrepentantly mean throughout the movie that I really didn't get why she left her home to Jo. She says a lot of harsh things in the book but the narrative makes it clear that she loves her great-nieces in her own way -- her remarks about Meg and John are made when she thinks that Meg has rejected his proposal and while she's a little grumpy at the wedding she sure isn't popping out like she is in the movie. We so see much more of her with Amy that logically it feels like she would have left Plumfield to her, as a reward of sorts -- or possibly to Meg and John since they have a family.

fcj8g3e,"I respect that you know the books inside out and have been such a fountain of knowledge about the nuances and details of the original story in this subreddit discussion. Unfortunately, and quite clearly even amongst us all here, stories do not exist in a vacuum. They interact with the readers, with the time they were read, and with our own personal stories. In my opinion, and I am apparently not alone on this, Greta Gerwig, a fan of the books herself, took away from this 150 year old tale, her own understanding of the tale and what kind of story she wanted to tell about it, in the time we live now. I don't agree with you that it was a hot mess but I can understand ( based on your opinions) that the movie clearly did not unfold the way you played it in your head for many years. But it does not invalidate Gerwig's version. I saw a clear story. It may not be as Jo-centric as other versions but it was clearly a story about the weight of childhood actions in adulthood, about the contrast between what we dreamed about when we were younger and what we actually get as adults. It was a story about love and companionship and the bittersweetness of growing up. I didn't see at all the Jo-Amy resentment tale you saw, nor the self-satisfied, self- congratulary-ness you felt. I believe, more than many recent movies , Gerwig managed to create a movie that was faithful to both the female empowerment of the book and the times we live in, without coming across preachy, heavy handed or smug. I also think the ending allows for many interpretations, and is one of the reasons why this version is so powerful. But I think that to even accept that ending (and any of its possibilities), you'll have to accept that someone else other than Louisa is allowed to tell this story. That maybe, just maybe, a movie is allowed to be brave in a story partly about creative courage. That maybe literal adaptations isn't what this Gerwig version is about. We are lucky to have the books, the perfect version lives in our heads, the beauty of film adaptations is seeing how such a beloved tale can be made fresh and current over and over again, today, tomorrow, 200 years from now.",ef4z7u

What is very disappointing as well is how wonderfully classic storybook the 1994 film version is and how modern this film felt, it no longer seemed like a story but a biopic. The 1994 film manages to transport you to a different time and place. I grew up watching that film and understood it well. And this version definitely feels like no one can “grow up” watching it because of the confusing timeline, little 6-12 year old kids are not going to be able to follow the story being presented. And using the same actress to play a 12 year old was very bizarre. I was disturbed when she was explaining the lemon trading, it looked like a mentally challenged woman talking nonsense. Also little kids don’t focus on color grading to understand the plot, only film enthusiasts and cinephiles do. I appreciate the experimental method Gerwig employed, but i was disappointed. The actress that plays Jo was fantastic tho. Her energy was palpable and believable. And i also liked that Jo had two different alternate endings. That was very cool 👍🏻Also another disappointment was how Gerwig didn’t focus on the importance of the novel jo had written. I think that is why Amy is seen as a more likable character.

Elio would never have asserted himself so boldly or loudly. His confession of love to Oliver was done in a quiet, coy way, almost entirely through body language. Laurie is in Jo's face, raising his voice, insisting she hears him. That's just one example. Two characters with the same motivation, trying to achieve the same thing, played in an entirely different way. Chalamet himself has pretty nervous energy, he's fidgety and a live wire. I'd say the character he's played most similar to himself is probably his character in Beautiful Boy (when sober). That's the only time I really saw his own mannerisms really come through.

fc98tfz,"Ha - Amy is the best. Always my favorite character. The movies usually streamline the story so it's all Jo and Laurie throughout and then suddenly it's ""nuh huh, I don't love you"" and Laurie marries Amy. In the book Jo is absolutely dreading Laurie's upcoming declaration of love and tries to do everything to discourage him from speaking.  Also in the book Laurie's romantic view  of himself takes a hit when he finds himself ""trying to remember"" Jo instead of ""trying to forget."" while he's in Europe.

When I reread the book this last time, I saw how immature and kind of self-involved Laurie could be, although he was obviously generous and good-natured. March spends a lot of time with Amy in the book. Amy responds to aesthetics the way Jo responds to stories and drama. Some of her vanity and some of her ability to function in society comes from her instinctive affinity with beauty, including the fine points of social interactions and good manners. She matures way earlier than Jo ever did and has much more patience. When working for Aunt March she has the good sense to spend a lot of time talking to Aunt March's french maid in French, which is how she learns.  Amy is kind of a genius, but a lot of readers don't pay attention, even when Jo tells us this about her. In the book, there's the infamous day of social calls when Jo sabotages her own chances of going to Europe. At one visit, Amy overhears Jo talking about her. One person admires how well Amy rides horses and asks who taught her. Jo tells the truth. Nobody! We couldn't afford it! She taught herself sitting on a tree branch! She's so good the local stable lends her out horses for next to nothing because she teaches them how to carry ladies! One day Amy had the chance to ride a horse where there was no road to the barn so she rowed herself across the lake with her saddle in the boat, and marched up the hill to the barn with the saddle on her head!

Amy was mortified to overhear this but just look at the type of person Jo is describing. Amazing. Amy was just discreet and Jo wasn't.

I don't think Bhaer was wish-fulfillment. I think Alcott liked her independence and once the money poured in with Little Women she liked it even more. She said once she felt she was a peculiar soul because she'd ""fallen in love with lots of pretty girls but never once with a man.""

I did some Alcott reading and the endings for the girls were what the publishing culture demanded, not real life at the time. The real Amy DID teach art and was good at it, DID exhibit in Paris, and even wrote a guide for women who wanted to pursue art in Europe with limited money. The book Amy wants to be Michaelangelo or nothing, which pretty much guarantees she's going to default to marrying rich. The real Jo (Louisa) came from an unstable, destitute family, not a cozily poor one (her father was the worst) and the girls were frequently made to live apart. She also writes sensational stories like Jo does, but instead of marrying writes an instant best seller and is rich the rest of her days. What does it say that Alcott had to shoehorn her real life characters into these stereotypical outcomes.

ETA - in the third book (Jo's Boys?) Alcott has a forward where she says many readers want more Amy, but Alcott says it's hard for her to write Amy since her namesake May has died and is no longer around to laugh and comment on the book version of herself. Alcott ended up raising May's daughter, Louisa.",ef4z7u
fckhl1s,"Yep. She totally sanitized her life and kind of sold herself and her sisters short in the marriage plot format she used for Little Women. She made her upbringing one of cozy poverty with the helpful addition of a couple of emergency fail safes (the Lawrences next door, Aunt March) when it was actually hellish poverty and at times Hummel-level deprivation. She and her sisters couldn't even be kept together much of the time and needed to be farmed out to the charitable or relatives. It's funny what a force Bronson Alcott was in her real life while Mr. March is practically invisible in the book. Even when he's home he's invisible. Louisa's own life lacked the marriage plot, and she and her sisters were crazy talented and smart. That's the one carry over - the foursome WAS interesting.

Thought Emma Watson was very bad.  Eliza Scanlon was excellent but not sure why they cast somebody round-faced for Beth when Beth spends much of the story whittled down to near-transparency after her initial illness.  I am going to differ from absolutely EVERYBODY when it comes to Ronan. Ronan is very intelligent, but her organic temperment seems quiet and more gentle. IMO this is why her performance in ""Brooklyn"" had such impact - it was so natural she didn't seem to be acting. Although she is very genuine and natural, I don't always buy her as a real spitfire type she is always getting cast in when she plays American or is in an American film.

Winona Ryder is Jo, not even Saorise Ronan (potentially my favorite actress ever) could top her, Susan Sarandon is Marmee, as she captured both the warmth and wisdom of Marmee, unlike Laura Dern whose Marmee felt less inviting and motherly, Christian Bale is Laurie, due to how he was able to capture both the boyishness and ruggedness of the character, while Timothee Chalamet felt far too scrawny and immature to capture the true essence of the character, and Claire Danes is Beth, as IMO no actor on this planet could portray that character the way she did. I will say I definitely preferred Amy's portrayal in the 2019 version (ever so slightly, as Kirsten Dunst was great) but for me, that's the only character I felt the 2019 version did better. On top of the superior acting, the score in the 1994 version is arguably the greatest movie soundtrack of all-time, while the 2019 version's score was comparatively weaker. Also, the structure of the 1994 version was much easier to follow, while the time-hopping of the 2019 version made for a more confusing watch. 


Although I prefer the 1994 version, the 2019 version was still great and very well done, as I do agree it was better shot, each character was more fleshed out as airtime was evenly dispersed between the four sisters, and the overarching messages displayed in the film were very poignant and accurately portray the struggles women faced in society then and still face today. However, the 2019 version doesn't hold a candle to the 1994 version for those aforementioned reasons listed above.",ef4z7u

But yes, in the screenplay, the character in the scenes with the publisher is named as 'Jo'. I believe the book she has at the end also says 'Jo March' on the front (whereas in the title credits at the beginning when we see the book it says Louisa May Alcott). However, I'd need to see it again to confirm this. I think Gerwig has purposefully made Alcott and Jo almost interchangeable here.",ef4z7u

Her version is definitely trying new things that the others haven't, particularly in regards to the ending. As her version is now the most critically acclaimed of all of them, it was clearly a story worth telling in 2019. Her trying to shoehorn commentary on race into it that no one has ever tried to do before would have been disastrous. And you can't just put people of color in there without commenting on it when it's set in the Civil War, that would have been rightly criticized as tokenism. I'm not saying there is no room for a racially diverse Little Women but a white woman should not be the one to attempt it.

This version's Amy is actually very different from the book; she is capable of very hurtful, damaging actions, and I think even she was scared of what she let herself do, hence the desperate reaction on the lake. Book Amy was impulsive, childish, didn't think twice before she acted, and knew her pretty face would allow her to get away with a lot of bad behavior. Movie Amy is aware of these things, but her actions were deliberate and calculating, as you said, which makes her MUCH more interesting to me than Book Amy ever was. I still maintain that the development and portrayal of the Amy character really made the movie so much better than I thought it would be. Now I want to go watch it again!",ef4z7u

They showed Beth playing with dolls, at home for the entirety of the film (she repeatedly ill of course, but still), the only one to not interact with someone else in a late-teen/adult relationship-ish kind of way, and the actress is noticeably younger. Of course, many real life people fit into that description and are in their 20s, but in the context of the film, meaning in contrast to her sisters, it suggested to me (and as you say, a lot of other people) that she was the youngest.",ef4z7u

fcb3kt2,"It wasn't as big a deal in the book. That part of the book spends most of the time showing how perfect Bhaer is. Gives her Shakespeare, takes her to dinner parties full of her sort of people. Then she leaves NY because Beth needs her. She wants to take Beth to the mountains to get her better, but Beth is too weak to go. They go to the seashore and everybody knows it's The End. The house is lonely, Beth is dying, her parents are heartbroken, all her sisters are gone, Beth dies.  Alcott then does this big thing about how brave spinsters are but when you hit 25 and aren't married, it can be pretty harrowing. Jo either isn't or can't write at this point so she's in her early 20s and has no life. She's like the Miss Havisham of the March sisters. I'm not sure why she doesn't go back to NYC - her parents need her? She's not sure Frederich Bhaer wants her back? She's lost both her new life in NYC which suited her perfectly, and she's living with the ghosts of her old life. She's totally stuck so it's like, ""If I'd said yes to Laurie I wouldn't be alone."" She admits she doesn't love him anymore than she did when she turned him down but at this point she needs a lifeline.",ef4z7u

fdbvle7,"Dunno. For me it felt less like a punishment for Amy and more of a grudging bit of respect towards Jo. I always thought aunt marches perspective was this:
Meg married poor and deserves to wallow in her choice. Amy married rich and needs nothing from her.  And Jo. Has the same stubborness and clear thinking as Aunt March, though she lacks the ability to hold her tongue. She won’t get anywhere in life. Also she did read to her and help her before Amy came. Maybe if I give her the estate it will cause a man to look beyond her defects/Spark her into actually doing well by herself. If nothing else, I know she won’t squander it and the family will have a place to retire to.",ef4z7u
fc9t4c6,"Love you for saying this! I don’t get the venom towards Amy for marrying a person who loves her and who she loves. Jo chose to reject Laurie, knowing deep in her heart they would be unhappy. Laurie wasn’t a lover to Jo, he was a dear friend up until the very moment she was so grief-stricken that she thought marrying Laurie could make her happy. 

Amy was undeniably a brat, didn’t have much luck (got whippings/humiliated at school) but she is charming. And she is good at it. Amy earned her Europe trip where Rome “took all the vanity out of [her]. 

In the book, it was clear that Amy in France once cared about what Laurie thought of her. But resolved that she cared more about calling out Laurie’s laziness. She didn’t really give a damn anymore if he would hate her. She just had to tell him off for his sake. 

In Gerwig’s screenplay, she had Amy assert herself to Laurie in other ways so he can really, fully see her. And it worked. 

As Amy said, love doesn’t just happen to a person. Amy and Laurie did some introspection in their time away. 

They saw their own faults and worked on it. They happened to see each others’ greatness as well.

And that’s how they recognized the love that’s in front of them. 

(if i may add, their relationship’s framework / introspection is like what Monica and Chandler have/did.)",ef4z7u
fclprew,">There are plenty of things that have been successful and then their sequels haven't for various reasons. Considering the first part of Little Women ended when their father comes home for Christmas, there was no pressure to have them romantically paired off as young teens. Doesn't mean there wouldn't have been pressure to do so for them as adults.

I'm saying we KNOW. Alcott has been thoroughly researched and we already KNOW. There's not really a ""who's to say"" about it.

I don't think having a Frederick who actually resembles the Frederick of the book has ever been tried, because IMO filmmakers have always assumed viewers would reject him if he mimicked the book. No  matter how they hunk him up, it's never really accepted, so I think the next version should be closer to the book and focus more on the character aspects that made Jo love him. It was more than his critique of her writing. Gabrielle Byrne was older but also a certified hearthrob. That's what I mean.",ef4z7u
fckct7c,"In addition to this, Louisa straight up and said that she made ""a funny match"" for Jo. She intended to throw people off. I don't like seeing Bhaer get treated poorly in adaptations, but people are being provoked to respond this way. This is also an issue of investment. We invested our hearts into Jo and Laurie's relationship, only to have that stomped on, and then we invested ourselves in Jo's quest to be single, which also ends with a [stomp.](https://stomp.Now) Now that I think about it, the only reason we've stuck around so long is probably because we got invested in what happened to the characters, because things start to take a turn to the ""blah"" once we've landed in Book II. You might enjoy that volume more if you just read it before Book I. You'll have invested in the endgame.",ef4z7u
fewlzzu,"Very interesting.

Gerwig basically abandoned Jo when she switched to Louisa, or she moved Jo to a new place without showing us how she got there.

fcc5azq,"I agree with you guys. Although I might take it a bit further. Something felt off at the theatre, but now I realize what it was. Laurie and Jo had no chemistry. It always fell flat to me and was more about external appearances than internal emotion. For example, their relationship in this movie can be painted as them always hitting each other. There's no real heart to heart, only hand to hand, or skip to skip. The dancing scene and Jo hitting Laurie's arm after he tried to take her arm when they left the theatre embody their relationship. The closest I saw them get close to a heart to heart was Laurie's admission that he had married Amy, which honestly came off as a very intentional statement rather than an accidental one. The whole proposal scene didn't faze me a bit.  It just seemed like Timothee was sending off arrows that were continually  thwarted by Saoirse's force field.",ef4z7u

Especially by that scene in the carriage where he was like I promise I’ll kiss u before u die of something like that I think it scared me for life lmao,ef4z7u
fckgih1,"Agreed. Never thought I'd like Chalamet in this role but in terms of original concept, Laurie is a kid in the first half and quite a young man in the second (early 20s). That's why it's all so high drama. They all fit together, age-wise. We need a Laurie who is still pretty much like a kid. Not a grown hunk who meets a pre-pubescent girl and marries her eight years later. Jo and Laurie are only 3 years older than Amy (they're fifteen and Amy is 12 at the start) and they all sort of grow up together.

One thing I got when I recently re-read the book was how tempermental and high drama Laurie can be. For most of the book he's that great best friend who is sociable, good-natured, kind-hearted and very generous with material things. But there's a scene after his grandfather punishes him for his prank with Meg and John where you can see a real diva, complete with similar threats to the ones he made when Jo rejected him.",ef4z7u
fcc1gz2,It wasn’t Kirsten Dunst when he was proposing/they married.,ef4z7u
fgktl17,"So I’m super late to this conversation but I was looking for just this! 

Yes there are two endings - Jo’s true ending is seeing her book bound. While the ending where she runs after Baehr, and the subsequent school scene where all of them are married, is the ending to Jo’s in universe book. Her publisher insists on a wedding in her novel, so she gives it to him - but as she says, she married no one. She sees her book published and sort of morphs into Alcott herself, who never did marry. 

I read an abridged version of the novel as a child, and was vaguely aware of the major plot points, like Beth’s death, but I’ve never believed Amy and Laurie belong together. Maybe it’s the sappy romantic in me but I truly think Jo and Laurie were soulmates, even if they struggled with the romantic side of things. I’ve always felt that Laurie married Amy because he couldn’t bear to return to Jo still single and sad, he didn’t want her to think of him as pining after her. 

To me that makes it so much sadder, because it’s just such a pure missed connection. He does it to try and protect both of them and it backfires so terribly. He’s so clearly lying when he says she’s right that they would have hated each other. So clearly in love with her when Baehr comes to dinner. It truly just breaks my heart. 

I think I’ll always wish Laurie and Jo could have been together, as much as I love Gerwig’s overall ending. Out of all the books I’ve read, if I could change the ending of one of them, it would be that.",ef4z7u
ff61357,Thank you!,ef4z7u

fc4meiq,"Jo’s character arc is that of romantic heroine. Or at least that was my interpretation. Keep in mind, I’m going off the structure of the film, not the book or chronological.

- She starts as an aspiring writer who isn’t interested in marriage.

- She has a meet-cute with Laurie at that party. They do that weird dancing and then they take a carriage ride home.

- He meets the Marches and connects with everyone in the family. Even his grandfather wants him to marry her.

- After hilarity ensues, he decides he wants to marry her. But she doesn’t think it will work out.

- She finally find success as a writer. He decides to pursue the sister instead. Around the same time, Jo decides that she is ready for marriage and Laurie is the man that’s loved her all along.

- If this were a romcom, this would be the point where she interrupts the wedding and proclaims her love. But oops, they already got married. The end.",ef4z7u

There is seriously nothing worth being so absurdly critical about, and the people doing it quite obviously seemed to just have a bone to pick with her already and are not worth considering for that reason. I've yet to see anyone say she was bad here who was ever going to give her a chance or give or any sort of credit or admit the effort and great performance she gave, and they have *never* been fair to her to begin with.",ef4z7u
fc6k8s9,"Well yes, I think if they were looking objectively they'd be giving greater credit for the performance she gave. I'm mostly talking how they viewed it subconsciously. Sure, maybe not *absolutely* everyone falls under the brush, but I see the incredibly large portion of them being unfair.",ef4z7u
fcvhyr3,"I've thought about it and think Alcott fails Jo in the book and that's why Jo's adulthood is problematic. The movies generally try to show her successful in NY (or on track to be) and meeting an incredible hunk of a professor, and it works out for her in the end. In the book, she's pretty much the only daughter of the surviving three who has no vision of her life as an adult, so it's difficult for the reader/audience to picture Jo grown up. What happens is Alcott kind of sends Jo into this punishing, dead end loneliness because she's never wanted to adult it. There's no one to play with, no more hijinks, no adventures. Only good works and self-sacrifice on the road ahead. Even the fun of writing successful, racy, scandalous short stories is taken from her. And, it's that loneliness that ultimately seems to help sell the entrance of the Professor and her decision to open a school (which is almost like letting her rewind back to childhood).  Amy has a more ""natural"" progression. She grows up, she travels, gains experiences in the adult world by going out into it, gets married. Meg is still kind of a little girl when she gets married but she does see herself having a home and being the domestic center of it, so she grows into her role. Jo is sort of majicked into adulthood, with the Little Woman version of adulthood being a wife.

fcgz3v1,"The Laurie character whipped me around in the book when I first read it (I was under 10 years old). I had no preconceptions. When it was floated that it would be better if Meg married Laurie instead of John, I was all yes yes! no processing Laurie was only sixteen. I was as full of dread as Jo when Laurie turned all googly eyed around her and wanted to step into the book and help her barricade against him with the sofa pillows. I don't know what I was feeling - maybe recognizing nice guy syndrome without realizing it, but I was upset for her and pissed at him. Jo's idea about Beth/Laurie was obviously horrible. Amy was my favorite and I wanted her to marry rich and handsome, but there was also the idea that she had boundaries, could command respect from Laurie, and make him behave. Laurie is really extra and OTT in the book and Jo does NOT help. She has to wheedle and coax him and his grandfather after his Meg/John prank instead of telling him to suck it up and take his punishment like a grown up. I did NOT want Laurie for myself - he was not a fantasy guy for me like Darcy in P&P or Rochester in Jane Eyre. He was super immature, and the more he threw himself at Jo the more he turned me off. Then of course he goes off to Europe, calms down, and realizes how much of it is histrionics and ego, particularly after Amy reads him for filth. I'm actually curious how some readers/viewers would take Laurie now if they reread the book instead of referencing the 1994 film.",ef4z7u

fckd261,"I get it but I think Gerwig relied too much on the book or our knowledge of the book when she didn't want to have a coherent narrative, and then tossed the book when it suited her. I actually think those parts of the narrative she invented worked as stand alone - Amy's early crush on Laurie helped this movie, Jo's resentment of Amy persisting into adulthood helped the movie, Jo's regret over Laurie on the basis it was shown to us helped the movie because it all helped clarify the narrative in a situation where a story is being translated/condensed into film even though they were a change from the book. MY complaint versus the book is Gerwig lets herself off the hook as far as telling a coherent Jo narrative in favor of going meta and relying utterly on our knowledge of Little Women the book and Louisa May Alcott's s backstory, she does it when it suits her, and that's a cheat and it's also unearned. And the irony is she distorts both Alcott's backstory AND the book.

Frederick doesn't make sense in this movie, and that's not a complaint that it's not how the book went. It's a complaint that he doesn't make sense in the movie - he's co-opted for this meta move. A meta move that does not skew with the very heartfelt scenes immediately previous where we see a genuinely heartbroken and lonely Jo who is reaching out to her old friend (whom she doesn't love) for a companionate marriage because that's how bleakly she feels. And then abruptly it's here's Frederick who comes back, then ha ha - the strong feminist author doesn't want to marry off her heroine!! Or maybe she did (he's there at Plumfield). Who knows - but isn't this clever and empowering? No, because it undermines Gerwig's own narrative about Jo up to that point. It's her movie. SHE's the one who showed us the ""I'm so lonely"" Jo, and then abandoned it for ""inside baseball"" about our presumed knowledge about Alcott's backstory and completely abandons Jo in favor of conflating her 100% with Louisa.  I'm not a fan of abandoning the narrative, or bringing your heroine to a particular emotional peak and then pretending it never happened or never doing anything with it.",ef4z7u

I don’t want Jo to marry a rich boy or to live in a big house. She marries a poor man and inherits a big house which she turns into a school. Adult Amy is perfectly good, it’s 12 year old Amy that is a brat, she grows out of it. In fact Amy is the most pragmatic of the sisters, a trait I highly value.",ef4z7u

I'm just saying they all feel like an actor instead of a character. He doesn't feel separated from himself and become immersed *to me*. A lot of his reactions when he needs to dig deep for emotions don't feel natural and they wreak of the same uncomfortable emotions/reactions I see him portray in candid interviews.

Reading the way you've described it here though, I can't help but wonder if the vitriol that Amy faces from readers (especially, in my experience, from women) is that she is actually a *male* archetype, and plays against traditional female gender roles much more than Jo does.

My main reason for this argument would be thinking about how you've described her presentation as relentlessly stubborn and willful, even if she has the veneer of fitting into society that Jo sometimes lacks. Also, the all-or-nothing ""Michaelangelo or bust"" mentality is also something I'd associate with the bombastic male wannabe genius archetype (basically, anyone described as Byronic).

Haven't read the book in ages, and this will be a fun thing to think about when I use the movie as occasion to reread.",ef4z7u
fckksa4,"It reminds me a bit of Laura Ingalls Wilder -- she didn't change as much about the sisters' ultimate fates (stopping earlier in their lives helped, and she also rejected a suggestion that Mary should keep her vision in the fictional world) but she also upgraded the Ingallses to ""cozy poverty"" when they were similarly flat broke, living hand to mouth, and separated more than once -- she also wrote out a few characters from ""The Long Winter"" because she had disliked them, thought they had just made the whole experience worse. I wonder how much LIW's choices may reflect why Louisa wrote her sisters the way she did -- of course, a neat narrative sells better and that's always a consideration, but in addition to the very real privacy concerns and potential embarrassment of a ""warts and all"" retelling, why would she want to dig through all of that again? Emotionally it would probably have been rough, especially when her father was abolitionist hero Bronson Alcott who was considerably less heroic in private life. She may have been more comfortable writing a narrative in which each sister's ultimate fate (except Beth's -- and even Beth got a more peaceful death than the original had) represented what she actually wanted as opposed to what she ended up with.

 I think that's one reason Mr. March is practically invisible -- he diverges so much from Bronson Alcott that there's virtually nothing left. Really the only thing they have in common is being ministers, being poor (although Mr. March is poor for much nobler reasons, and he treats his wife and daughters 1000% better) and being gone for long periods -- again, for much nobler reasons than the original. After stripping away all the shitty things about Bronson, there just wasn't a whole lot left and she didn't have a template for what a good father to those girls would have been like, so he essentially became a pale shadow of Marmee. 

Amy is an interesting case because while May had a fascinating life, the meat of her accomplishments all took place after the publication of *Little Women* and largely because of it; Louisa could afford to take her to Europe and start her off on her serious study of art -- but by the time May was studying, meeting famous artists, exhibiting, and marrying, she had already been fictionally  married to Laurie and brought home. It's possible that Amy's ""I'll be great or nothing"" mindset was closer to how May was actually talking or acting in 1868, or at least what she may have felt condemned to. How May felt about her fictional alter ego being married to Laurie is something I don't know, maybe she enjoyed it. Anna and Lizzie's fates were pretty well set by the time the book came out, but for May, most of what we remember about her now still lay in the future. (I did wince a little at the final shot in the school scene which showed Laurie and Amy holding their baby daughter, remembering how May died only a few months after having hers -- but keeping Amy alive after May died was also Alcott's choice, and I don't blame her for it.)",ef4z7u

fcluvr1,"I've had to give some thought to why I never liked Jo/Laurie, and loved Amy/Laurie and I realize a few things. If Amy had ""submitted"" to Laurie the way Meg submitted to John I'd have hated it. Instead Amy was the boss of him or else it came across as true equals, adults, not kids playacting as adults (as I would have felt with Jo/Laurie. Jo never 100% convinced me as an adult - at least not one with her own home and conventional responsibilities). I was really happy that we never saw Amy ""subdued"" - Laurie didn't come along and teach her to correct her faults like John did with Meg. Amy corrected her own faults and her character did deepen when she fell in love with Laurie but it didn't have that paternalistic vibe we got with Meg/John and Jo/Frederick. I really liked that in a book where two out of three of these independent women had to almost literally sit on their man's knee and learn how it is. For some reason Alcott never betrayed Amy that way. Amy grew her own self up and came to her own realizations without her love interest pointing it out. John did it a million times with Meg and Frederick had to teach Jo that scandal stories were beneath her.

If Jo and Laurie had, as teen-agers, run down to the docks and stowed away on a boat to India, I'd have believed it.  I'd have believed the experience would have either confirmed their respective wild sides or they both would have been crying for mama (or grandpa) after a month. I kind of think more the former. Then if they came back and in some way they were ""together"", I'd have seen it as pragmatic on Jo's part, ""Well, he's a guy and he's grown, and we're a team, so this is something I need to do for him."" without being that into it herself. BUT, if Jo had gotten together with Laurie, gotten married, and moved into that house she'd have jumped out the window in six seconds. She'd spent most of the book definitely ""just not that into him"" THAT WAY and if his pushing her had changed her mind I'd have been upset. The book either had to show her attracted to and kind of in love with him but unsure how to navigate it, or else not do it. And the book decided to not do it. There was probably a way to do it but to have Jo sincerely know she didn't love him but because he makes a stink she gives in and says yes or realizes she IS in love cause he's making such a scene was not the way, so thank God Alcott was true to the groundwork she had prepared (at least until the very end with bambino and schoolteacher Jo).",ef4z7u

Chalamet showed immaturity and his thought process is half child, but that also made the stakes feel too low. If it's just a puppy love version of a proposal, then Jo's decision is hardly even questionable, right? With Christian Bale, you feel more that she could have said yes (as opposed to just trying to convince herself that she could have said yes later on after facing adversity). If she could have said yes, that makes it much more of a real drama when she has to suck it up, smile and congratulate Amy

Christian Bale's Laurie seems overbearing compared to Chalamet's, but that is also part of the point of Little Women. Ronan's Jo is obviously not intimidated in any way by Laurie. Ryder's Jo is not on a level playing field with Laurie -- you feel that she has to struggle to have her voice heard in that relationship in that society",ef4z7u

fc84080,"I think you're pretty alone on your view of the acting. Not that the 1994 cast were bad but I'd only say a few of them were on par (Winona, Danes, Sarandon) or better (Trini). The men especially here were a clear improvement. Bale is great as young Laurie but his performance as the older Laurie is pretty flat and bad, whereas Chalamet gives it life as well as managing to sell both the relationships with Jo and Amy, whereas Bale only managed the former. Laurie is meant to be immature and as Chalamet is 24 himself, clearly not too young to play the part. Some guys that age just look like that. Garell is much more easier to swallow as a love interest for Jo than a guy in his mid-40s and Chris Cooper brings depth to the part of Mr Laurence that had never been there before. I agree the 1994 score is better but the 2019 one is still some fine work.

Naturally the most invested are going to be the most vocal, but I don't think the book was made a best seller purely by Jo and Laurie fans. I only saw that investment when I went online.  Most book fans I know like the story overall. As a kid, I was the only ""shipper"" I knew as I was secretly very happy about Amy and Laurie (and very creeped out about Jo and Laurie) even though I wasn't expecting Amy and Laurie when I first read the book. My sister read it at the same time, don't think particularly focused on Amy, but wasn't fussed about Jo and Laurie at all. She liked the story, the family, how they grew up, their challenges, and even some of the way Beth's death was treated. It was a fantasy family. 

I've thought about WHY I didn't ship Jo and Laurie as I was pretty meh about Jo and Frederick back then too, and it certainly wasn't because I thought she should be with Laurie instead. While I didn't analyze it back then, I thought that Jo and conventional romance (even with an unconventional man) were a poor fit, and there was something ""off."" Maybe it's the gay coding people write about. The only thing MORE off than Laurie/Jo and Laurie/Frederick was the very VERY end of the book where Alcott is writing about Jo with her babies. Not ""baby"". BABIES. It was like - the hell you say Alcott? No way! It was like Stepford Jo, and who IS that woman. Yes, Alcott preached and explained and did a whole lot to let us know how Jo got there but I didn't buy it based on everything that came before.

But that’s more a general problem of the movie : they all look the same age, and at every episode of their life. I think Gerwig is not very interested in the characters as children, but only as adults when the age difference isn’t visible anymore.

fcaionr,"I think the thing is that Laurie isn’t some random Ryan Gosling character coming in out of nowhere to start something out from nothing. He’s not even John Brooks, an acquaintance that comes in with pure intents. Laurie is more than a friend, he is family, a brother, in every way but blood. The closest analogy is marrying an adopted sibling or a step sibling you grew up with. It happens, but the steps to get there is different and foreign to probably most of us.

So in the film, just because they like one another, it doesn’t mean Laurie and Amy can erase their history and familiarity with one another. So they talk with one another frankly and call one another out, something they do because they care. And it is in the midst of their back and forth their intentions are revealed. Laurie never directly said things like “I love you” or “I can’t bare to see you be with someone else”. Instead, he challenges upfront Amy’s lack of feelings and chemistry with her suitor. They are practically a couple platonically, and a couple with history too. When Laurie threw out the final hint, he still haven’t outright declared anything, but Amy got it, and she revealed her cards also (Jo can’t ever navigate through these nuances). She basically told Laurie, yes, but no, because you chose me 2nd. This might be the first time the word ‘love’ was used as a feeling between them. Nevertheless, that was their confessions. From that point on, all they needed are time and a tragedy to help them see things through.

fcnt0fv,"There is no shortage of **Little Women** adaptations, so again, if all you’re going to do is slavishly put the text of the novel on screen, why bother?

fcl0m4s,"Hmm I am genuinely trying to understand why you have such a problem with the way Jo's arc is resolved in Gerwig's version because it sounds like this is where the movie fell apart for you. I guess I don't see how Gerwig cheated or dropped the narrative, assuming that we agree that she has every right to tell her version of the tale and not just faithfully follow the book. At the point in the movie ( Jo's emotional climax as you stated) where Jo says she doesn't believe love should be the only solution for women, she's also conflicted that she's so lonely (paraphrasing). As a result, she contemplates a marriage of companionship with Laurie, which dead-ends because of Amy. Now grieving from loneliness, Frederick shows up, whom we know from the beginning of the movie that she's fond off but regrets parting unhappily from. So the movie (and Jo) now has two options - #1 she follows her career ( Jo as Louisa/editor negotiating scene) because after all, she does still believe women shouldn't have to resort to marriage for happiness, OR #2 she could take the book route, set up Plumfield and (maybe, though the movie does not emphasize it and I agree ) marry Frederick. I don't think it's a stretch to believe that in ending possibility #1, Jo makes the decision to give up companionship/Frederick for a career, which makes this ending variation bittersweet because it's earned, we see it was indeed a sacrifice because of her 'I'm lonely' scene with Marmee. In the latter #2 ending, it's also equally plausible that Jo decides a career is not worth sacrificing Plumfield, having family around and possibly a marriage with Frederick, also consistent with how much she reminisced good times with her sisters in the movie.  But thirdly and that's why I think the ending is brilliant, it allows for a third interpretation, that perhaps Jo can have both, a modern take, as there's glimpses of red ( published) books on the table right at the end. So I guess in short, I think Jo's arc is resolved wonderfully, in many possible ways, consistent with the story told from the beginning of the movie, and faithful ( though not pedantically accurate) to the spirit of the books and with the bonus of having a little Louisa folded in....",ef4z7u
fct7tg4,"I don't know if I agree Jo fans are fans of the book. They are troubled by the book because she doesn't marry Laurie. A Jo who married Laurie would be a completely different Jo than Louisa May Alcott wrote, and yet that is the outcome so many wanted, which makes me separate Jo fans from book fans, and it's not even the actual book Jo that has the fans. I don't know how Laurie/Jo fans picture it going, unless in their heads they rewrite Laurie to be more like Jo or Jo to be more like Laurie than they actually are. I don't know where Jo got the patience to put up with him as they approached adulthood, not to mention Laurie was passionate about music and Jo couldn't care less. Laurie was also quite social - had masses of friends, but Jo stuck close to her blood relations. She didn't have a female friend even.

Now that I type this I think Jo does become a very problematic character for Alcott as she grows up because no matter how hard Alcott tries to fit Jo into a marriage trope it's just not a good fit. I mean she puts a LOT of work into it - does this whole sad prose poem about brave spinsters who put their hopes away at 25, puts Jo in this very bleak place before bringing the cozy, comforting, everything bagel of a Professor Bhaer back into her life to save her, but man once we wrap things up with Jo's babies on the picnic blanket she's pretty much lost me.  Actually lost me awhile before that when Bhaer goes, say ""Thou, not you, you is such a cold word."" or something like that, and Jo actually says, ""thou"". I'm like who IS this and who are we kidding here?

I said before if they wanted to do Jo/Laurie Alcott should have head them both run off to India on a tramp steamer as stowaways when they were teens, Jo disguised as a boy, and living that kind of itinerant lifestyle, although I'm not sure comfort-loving Laurie could have lasted.

The switch up is just too abrupt and there's no groundwork. Alcott  just kind of uses loneliness to transition Jo into marriage, so it feels like running from loneliness instead of towards something she wants. It's clear Amy always had a picture of married life, talked about it more than once and it's her life as a young eligible woman would transition easily to a young married woman, and Meg talked about what she wanted from marriage. Did Jo ever talk about what she wanted from marriage? She never pictured herself until the very end of the book so I think it's hard for us to picture.",ef4z7u

You could surely never place those two scenes side by side (pretending the time periods etc. are the same) and think they were the same character.

fcjrr95,"I don't think we're meant to question Jo's decision. I think we're meant to believe in, understand and respect why she said no and Chalamet and Ronan enable that to happen much more easily. Although, for what it's worth, while I've definitely been sad that Jo rejects Laurie while watching 1994, Bale never managed to make it feel truly emotional for me in the way that Chalamet does, despite his immaturity in the scene. I still feel for Chalamet's Laurie, as he has such ease of access to his emotions and brings them to the surface so easily. As for her sucking it up and smiling, in 1994 I didn't even feel like thats what she was doing. She just seemed genuinely happy straight away, which always seemed unrealistic to me even if she had no romantic love for Laurie. So this version automatically had more stakes for me in that regard, because Ronan played it much sadder and we see her gathering herself before going to talk to Amy. But it's not about Laurie, it's about her own loneliness. 

Why is Laurie being overbearing the point of Little Women? I read that Alcott originally wrote him as much more Jo's equal and was forced to change him into a taller, more traditional romantic lead. Her original intention makes more sense to me. I don't think Jo would want an overbearing boy in her life. I think she'd only accept a male as a friend that she didn't feel beneath and that didn't treat her that way.",ef4z7u
fcka4r8,"Have you read the book? Laurie and Jo are totally on a level playing field whatever their economic differences. She has no problem having her voice heard in general in that relationship. Her and Laurie's scene plays the way it does not because Jo doesn't have as strong a voice as he does in society but because he's her best friend and she feels terrible for hurting him, and because he's young and refuses to see any outcome but the one he wants. She is holding back out of kindness because she knows she's hurting him, but then she loses patience and lets him have it because he won't stop, basically tells him to suck it up and deal already.

The red rash they gave her when she was in the grip of illness did help.

OT when I was little and read the book, I didn't quite understand why scarlet fever left Beth in subpar health even after the fever broke and it went away. I've since learned that scarlet fever can leave the victim with irreversible kidney damage or heart damage. It seems clear that Beth's heart was damaged after the fever when she was 13-14.  1930s actress Jean Harlow had scarlet fever at age fourteen and died of renal failure at age 26.",ef4z7u

fccbvhx,">I think you're pretty alone on your view of the acting. Not that the 1994 cast were bad but I'd only say a few of them were on par (Winona, Danes, Sarandon) or better (Trini).


I feel like quite a lot of people agree with me that the 1994 version was better acted. That cast was stellar. Winona truly captured the essence of Jo, as did Saoirse, however, there's something about Winona's Jo that feels so real. It truly felt like her Jo was balancing her passion for writing, while also trying to come to grips with her feelings towards marriage in the 1994 version. That struggle felt less organic in the 2019 version with Saoirse's Jo, as the 2019 version really pushed forth the idea that career should come before marriage. Does any Eliza Scanlen scene in the 2019 version compare to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=215knS439jY&t=2s)? Honestly, I don't think so. There is absolutely no way she and Claire Danes are on the same wavelength IMO. Scanlen was serviceable as Beth but she really doesn't compare to Danes. Like I said previously, Sarandon was an incredible Marmee. She held unsaid wisdom, while simultaneously exuding both the warmth and love of a truly devoted mother. I just didn't get those vibes from Laura Dern's Marmee. She felt less inviting and motherly to me and more like a plot device used to usher along the stories of her daughters, particularly Jo. It's all subjective of course, so feel free to feel how you want to feel. 


>The men especially here were a clear improvement. Bale is great as young Laurie but his performance as the older Laurie is pretty flat and bad, whereas Chalamet gives it life as well as managing to sell both the relationships with Jo and Amy, whereas Bale only managed the former. Laurie is meant to be immature and as Chalamet is 24 himself, clearly not too young to play the part. Some guys that age just look like that. Garell is much more easier to swallow as a love interest for Jo than a guy in his mid-40s and Chris Cooper brings depth to the part of Mr Laurence that had never been there before.


Again, I disagree. Bale was much much better than Chalamet. Laurie is supposed to become more joyless and stale as he ages, so I liked how Bale acted him in the second half of the 1994 version. It remained true to the source material. I do agree that the relationship between Amy and Laurie felt more organic in the 2019 version (due in large part to Gerwig's choice to center the story more so around the four sisters and not just Jo as Armstrong did), however, Chalamet's Laurie felt like the same character throughout the entirety of the film. Even though six years had passed by, Laurie felt very much the same character to me. He was quite static, while in contrast, his character was more dynamic in the 1994 version. I actually prefer Professor Bhaer being much older than Jo. It felt like his character had truly experienced the world in the 1994 version, meaning he could match Jo intellectually, while also providing her with a sense of realism and stability (something that would be sorely lacking in a marriage between Jo and Laurie). In the 2019 version, Professor Bhaer felt less experienced, and while he offered Jo new perspectives and insights, he never really encouraged her work like the Bhaer in the 1994 version did. I do agree that Mr. Laurence was much better in the 2019 version, due in large part to the inclusion of his storyline with Beth and the piano. 


>I agree the 1994 score is better but the 2019 one is still some fine work.


All in all, I'd say the 2019 score is quite forgettable, while in contrast, the 1994 score stands the test of time. I still find myself returning to the soundtrack years later. I know for sure I won't be doing that with the 2019 version's score.  


>I think the 1994 version does the first half of the story better and the 2019 version does the second half far, far, far better. Overall, 2019 wins.


Again, this is all subjective but for the aforementioned reasons, I find the 1994 version to be much better in just about every capacity. It seems though we'll have to agree to disagree.",ef4z7u

It would make sense for him to be there either way considering he is a teacher and they are friends so that adds up and the book was about their lives and she was given the house. That happened post book publishing and they say that ""Under the Umbrella"" is the last chapter in the book which is when she goes after him. 

It's possible that is supposed to be part of the book but I think it's just their lives after the book and he's there because in the real book he's an important character for Jo so they left it a bit ambiguous but it's heavily implied they don't marry especially considering Alcott never married and that's who Jo is based on. I think they go back to the orange tint because the blue was set up to establish the mood around Beth's passing, it wasn't meant as orange=book, blue=real.

fcwhecx,"Well, the the fact that Jo left her flourishing life in New York to nurse her sister, then stayed home looking to a future of literal and existential emptiness is on Alcott, and IMO how she failed Jo. It could easily have been that Marmee encouraged Jo to return to NYC rather than coop herself up like the Miss Havisham of the March sisters in her childhood home. After all, they didn't want Amy to interrupt her time in Europe to come home, and Jo WAS getting up there in age - I think she might have been as old as 23. I could see Marmee saying honey, don't wither on the vine, go back to NYC where you were happy and have your writing. And who knows, you might meet a comfortable and smart portly kind professor soul mate!  Beth would have wanted you to.

Beth had been dying for awhile; Alcott could have written something inspiring/respectful that had the parents and Jo continuing to live full lives even though Beth finally kicked the bucket. Jo goes back to NY, maybe Amy and Laurie stop over en route back home and all that bit happens, then maybe there are some mixed signals with the Professor but she's back in the writing swim and mixing and mingling, then we wrap it up and as she and the Professor mull their future and maybe think about heading west together - hurray! Aunt March is dead and Plumfield is Jo's, she gets to have a future ""at home"" after all and returns to Concord or whatever it is fictitiously.

Instead we get the ""Doh! I forgot to get married!"" narrative as some sort of cautionary tale. How girls hope until they're 25 then quietly put their hopes back in the chest and undertake a life in service of others. Don't make fun of them girls! There is many a soft sweet memory/disappointment in those spinster hearts!  Jo was so vibrant as a girl, then successful and interesting in New York, then Alcott uses Beth's death to pull the plug. Net thing we know she's not even Jo anymore,along comes the Professor back into her life and gets her to say ""thou"" instead of ""you"" when she talks to him. She's kind of unrecognizable, IMO, and it's not really a fulfilling narrative AS TOLD. And actually I think the reason Jo wasn't sent back to New York was the point was for her to give up writing and become a wife/mother, just as Amy gave up art.

Amy's arc is problematic as I don't think Alcott made it plausible that she wanted to be ""great or nothing"". That's just the easy way out to get HER to give up what she's good at and get married as she can't do both. The Amy we saw prior to Europe made art out of everything from gardens to clothes to china to pen and ink, oils and charcoal. It's who she was.

I was sensitive to gender power imbalances even when I was really young so I was most comfortable when the woman wasn't  chasing or confessing her love or exposing herself before the man went first.

The book fleshes out their bond as children so much more, like his weekly visits to see her when she’s with Aunt March. They have their own, complex relationship that has such a depth to it that it’s easy to see how it fostered their adult feelings to grow. I think once Laurie hears definitively that Jo would not be his, he was given a sense of closure to that relationship and was allowed to let someone else in, someone he had always loved in a different way. It’s interesting that he loves Jo romantically, for it ultimately to turn platonic, and has the reverse experience with Amy.",ef4z7u

fcak9te,"But in the book the Jo thing becomes comical. Laurie fully intends to tragically mope through Europe, behaving badly because Jo rejected him. But as time goes on he's startled to find himself ""instead of trying to forget, he found himself trying to remember."" His whole thing for Jo is dying of its own volition but he has nothing to replace it with and has been a bit egocentric with it - taking off to Europe because he felt his rejection as so so tragic. To discover it's not really that big a deal kind of pisses him off about himself. He keeps trying to fan the embers back into flame, even proposing via letter again, but his passion for Jo just won't stay alive. There's nothing wrong with this - it just proves that Jo was right in the first place. She had already been very uncomfortable when Laurie started giving her googly eyes back home, desperately trying to head things off. He is really coming at her on all cylinders when he declares himself to her, to where finally (this is in the book) she starts getting pissed off. He's her best friend and she loves him so she absolutely hates to hurt him and wishes he hasn't said anything, but as he just refuses to accept her no she starts to lose her temper.

After I reread the book I saw how immature Laurie was.  Differently than Jo. Jo just doesn't want to grow up, but Laurie is obsessed with music (Jo  couldn't care less), particularly opera, and sort of sees himself as an opera-type character. He sees his rejection by Jo as an epic tragedy. Alcott finds the comedy in it but most movies play it as tragically as Laurie thinks it is. When Laurie is falling in love with Amy and forgetting about Jo it wreaks havoc with his self-image as this tortured epic lover whose heart was destroyed. A modern example of this kind of thing is ""Silver Linings Playbook"" where the leading man's rejection by his wife is so central to his identity he ignores/represses that he's fallen instantly in love with the Jennifer Laurence character.

Amy points out that Jo would not be thrilled with his indolence and self-pity either, and it's true. Jo was dealing with real shit back home and here was Laurie carrying on.",ef4z7u

This does not mean that in either version, Jo ever had romantic feelings for Laurie or would have married him.
 
Bale's emoting is understated compared to Chalamet's but I don't find the affect less emotional by any means. Even in the 1994 version, I interpreted Jo's response to Laurie and Amy's marriage as a suppression of at the least ambivalent feelings -- which again does not mean that she ever actually wanted to marry Laurie.

Jo is Laurie's equal or more as a person, but not an equal in freedom or power. And that applies to interpersonal dynamics between men and women. And you feel that in the 1994 version, whereas the 2019 feels more like it could be contemporary young people. That is what I meant",ef4z7u
fckaw3a,"I don't get the overbearing bit either - they are like twins in the book, Jo bosses him about, as far as he's concerned he's ruining things when he gets lovey about her. She knows he's tempestuous and highly emotional as when he's sulking his head off because he grandfather punished him for his prank about Meg and John. In that instance she goes and convinces the grandfather to ease up and then goes upstairs and convinces Laurie to stop sulking - she plays one against the other because in a lot of ways he's younger emotionally than she is, and FAR more spoiled. Has trouble with correction and rejection. Even though he's the first one to want a ""grown up"" relationship, she's still more mature. The fallout from the Meg/John episode shows a similar Laurie to the one rejected by Jo - he feels unfairly treated, threatens all kinds of self-punishment or running away, and is generally in a high sulk over nothing and has to be handled with kid gloves and cajoled.

I'm very proud of Jo during the declaration scene in the book. I do spend time wondering how much she's going to put up with his insistence, his refusal to take no for an answer, and then his Bitter Betty routine about how she WILL fall in love. She tries everything but then understandably loses patience with him, as he deserves.

IMO the 1994 movie tried to have it both ways, sort of suggesting that Ryder's decision to reject Laurie was more intellectual than emotional. Rationally she knew that they'd be a bad match, but she was tempted. The reality (in the book) is her decision WAS emotional. She hated to hurt people she loved and knew it would be easier if she loved Teddy. She TRIED. She even tried to sooth him by saying it was HER fault - ANY girl would love you but I just can't. This movie made that much clearer. She didn't love him ""that way"" and couldn't even though she tried. The argument she made wasn't about HER reasons, but trying to get him to accept her rejection. HER reasons were she didn't love him.",ef4z7u

After a second watch, I actually prefer Dern. Sarandon is wonderfully warm but Dern (and the script) give Marmee layers. We see her have tears on her face and wipe them away before she enters the room so the girls can't see. Her line (and delivery of said line) when talking about being angry nearly every day is fantastic and a new insight into the character. And her reaction to Beth's death incredibly moving. If she's less inviting and motherly, I think that was intentionally done. We're seeing things from her eyes, and not just her daughters who clearly saw her as the perfect, flawless mother.

I'm fine with Laurie becoming joyless as he ages and actually felt that Chalamet captured that quite well. There's a difference between that and becoming flat and dull to watch, as I felt Bale did, not helped with his lack of chemistry with Samantha Mathis.

fc9qdoo,"Yeah, exactly.  The first book is very passionate, portrays the sisters as very individual, and shows their struggles being ""gentlewomen"" with no money. They're friends with and interact with people who have the money their family used to have, which makes them feel self-conscious and humiliated at times. The first ""uh oh"" moment comes when here is John Brook, somewhat complacently wooing a teenage Meg. Meg who hated being poor and loved luxury even more than Amy ever did. But she falls for the poor tutor and it's painted as virtuous. I loved how Alcott showed what a pain in the neck it was to have no money at all - you have to be a companion to your aunt, you have crap to eat (fish balls for breakfast?), you don't have enough clothes to be properly dressed, you can't afford a proper doctor and are saved by the rich man next door, you can't have the fun that all your friends are having. This was not an era set up for ""gentlewomen"" to have jobs. That's as class bound as in England. It's governess or marriage (or other genteel pursuits like music teacher). And after showing how dispiriting it is to be poor, Meg marries poor. Meg turns from ""the best actress we've got"", and someone appreciating the ""luxury"" of occasionally sleeping in to marrying a pretty condescending guy and struggling with making homemade jam. It sets up these women as fierce and ambitious, then puts them in their place. The two books don't match. The Jo we know through 4/5ths of the book might well be happy running a boys school instead of  being a writer  - her lifelong passion (a boys freaking school!), but there is no way she'd be on a damn picnic blanket with a bunch of her own biological babies just loving being a mommy.

It was incredibly popular still at that point, so obviously the book's appeal/messages wasn't dependent on her matrimony. And I don't mean Louisa's Part 2 in marrying Jo off is not valid either. Like I said in my reply above to Secret Addition, Gerwig's version included an ending that featured HER interpretation of LW, it didn't neglect the book's version because it's also there, if you choose to view it that way.

fcs9ozx,"But the 1994 movie isn't canon, the book is, and the book makes it clear that Laurie isn't the road not taken but a guy totally in the friend zone who tries to break out and guilt trip Jo into going along with it. He's NOT a mature man, he is childish, he's petulant, and prone to emotional blackmail when he doesn't get his way. The Jo and Laurie scene echoes Laurie's attitude a few years earlier when he's in full histrionic mode because his grandfather punished him for a damaging prank. Jo had to cajole him then, too, like a child. After Laurie goes to Europe Alcott has great fun mocking his attempts to act like a tormented rejected lover and his inability to sustain his self image as wounded martyr. Her key sentence was ""instead of trying to forget, he found himself trying to remember.""  Laurie finally grows up in Europe, in part cause Amy kicks his ass. ""\[Amy\] never would pet him like the others."" says Alcott.  Meaning, she didn't coddle him.

The 1994 movie isn't the real Little Women, it's a version of Little Women that departs significantly from the book. It's just one version, one more ""based on"", like this one is.

If a movie were ever 100% accurate, it would show Jo wishing Meg would marry Laurie if Meg has to marry, then determined to match make Beth and Laurie, and then after Laurie has run off to Europe and Beth expresses surprise that Jo isn't in love with Laurie ""that way"", Jo is all, ""Amy is left for him and they'd be perfect but ultimately it's not my problem! It's his.""",ef4z7u
fcs8xxl,"I thought a huge problem with the 1994 movie was they did play it as if Jo might have said yes and it was a struggle to keep to her decision to say no. That is an utter mis-presentation of Alcott's portrayal of the relationship. Jo is completely dismayed when Laurie starts getting googly eyed and too affectionate. She is sending every signal she can but it's no good (his refusal to pay attention to her signals doesn't say anything good about him). She wants them to stay as they are and knows if he speaks she'll have to reject him and the relationship will change. Her signals aren't coy - she means it, the way she does in this movie. She goes to NY partly because she wants to get away from Laurie so he'll cool off. Laurie is one of her people like Beth is, and the original Jo is someone who is tormented by guilt if she hurts one of her people. Her hope is he'll get the hint and not force the subject. Her mother agrees both about her going away and that Jo and Laurie aren't suited romantically, which is a relief to Jo as she too worries that the families expect it. However Laurie is undeterred and insists on declaring himself. Laurie/Jo stans may find his declarations thrilling but I found them full diva and very unfair to Jo, who struggled to comfort him and reject him, but Laurie kept pushing when she'd comfort him. It's a tough scene. Finally Jo loses patience, admits that yes, maybe she'll fall in love for real with someone else and he'll have to handle it! Laurie goes full histrionic and behaves as if he's going to throw himself in the river but he just rows away.  I think he approaches her one more time in full puppy dog eyes mode and she's like, ""Laurie, I really truly can't. I don't love you."" He keeps forcing her to reject him, and it's annoying. The 1994 movie played it like  Jo was tempted and sexually attracted but her rational brain thought they were poorly suited - but she was tempted because she was in love with him even though it would be a disaster. That's an absolute creation of the 1994 filmmakers. Laurie never tried to kiss her  (that would really have finished him off), Jo was never in love with him, and never tempted to marry him when he asked. Her not loving him was the issue. She used ""unsuitability"" to try to persuade him, but when he rejected her reasons, she had to get to the point and hurt him. ""I don't like you that way."" It was clear the only way she'd say yes is if he managed to emotionally blackmail her and guilt trip her enough.",ef4z7u

Scanlen actually has more screen time and storylines than Danes if I recall correctly. She just didn’t make the most of her screen time like Danes did. I’ll say it again, Scanlen and Danes are not on par. They’re not even in the same stratosphere. Danes was far far superior. She is Beth.

That’s great. Dern just didn’t do it for me. I’ll say it again, Sarandon was much more motherly and inviting. She truly felt like the archetypal mother that Alcott made her character out to be. Dern didn’t. Those scenes you mention were also plentiful in the 1994 version and were also very well acted by Sarandon. Sarandon’s Marmee also mentions her feelings of pent up anger, her temper, and how she deals with it, so Dern’s Marmee mentioning it doesn’t really add any new layer to the character. That line is also featured in the book. Her being less inviting and motherly literally goes against everything her character stands for. If Gerwig chose to move her character away from that, I really wouldn’t be able to understand why. 


>I'm fine with Laurie becoming joyless as he ages and actually felt that Chalamet captured that quite well. There's a difference between that and becoming flat and dull to watch, as I felt Bale did, not helped with his lack of chemistry with Samantha Mathis.


Chalamet didn’t capture it well at all. He felt like a mopey teenager, not a man entering adulthood. It also didn’t help that there was no attempt made to age him up or at least make it appear as though six years had gone by. In contrast, Bale captured the essence of what it’s like to be a directionless young man entering adulthood by portraying the character as devoid of joy and fulfillment. Therefore, to me, Bale’s was more realistic and well acted, while Chalamet’s was less realistic and overacted. 


>I personally think people need to be able to root for Bhaer and Jo and most people are not going to root for a romance with a 20 year age gap, it will just never feel quite right.


There’s a strong contingent of people out there that support the relationship between the two, myself included, 20 year age gap and all. Besides, it doesn’t really matter what couple one “roots” for in the end. Jo ended up with Professor Bhaer because he was a better fit and the 1994 version accentuated the fact that he was a better fit by establishing a sizable age gap between the two, as it made it believable that Professor Bhaer could match Jo on an intellectual level and provide her with a sense of stability.",ef4z7u

That's because Alcott was pushed to write the second one and it very much was an economic arrangement for her. She thought it was sentimental, over the top, and it reads as almost surreal in some spots, especially knowing the characters from earlier. She can't come out and say ""Meg got a raw deal because now she's married and stuck in poverty and domestic servitude"" but she's smart enough to set it up in a way that 19 century parents would be happy to hand to their little girl. Much like Jo, Louisa wasn't aiming for high literature: she wanted to be paid (and now this is reminding me of how compelling the jo/frederich scene was early in the movie - ""this is what sells"").",ef4z7u

But several people on this page have found inconsistencies with this. I'm curious. I kind of feel like a lot of people are never going to accept a Laurie and Amy pairing, and I think it's the book's fault.

Despite the fact that a romantic pairing might seem off, it's one of those things that's so powerful that it can't be let go of.",ef4z7u
fckir6f,"Understood. I always felt Amy and Laurie ""fit"". When I was a kid I was disappointed in Frederick Bhaer. I'd have been happier with a guy where I felt there was more heat between them. Not to put thoughts in anyone's head but I wonder if the Laurie alternative had been more Jo's age, more exciting and better looking, but more intellectual and had certain things more in common, if not marrying Laurie wouldn't have stuck in the craw of Jo fans so much. 

 I'd read a little bit about Alcott at the time and my assumption was Alcott was ""the ugly sister"" just like Jo, so when she invented a man for Jo she made him not handsome and older because she thought a more conventional love interest wouldn't be believable. I think now that was a sexist take on things. IMO Frederick Bhaer works as the deux ex machina who comes in with sort of an instant-family persona of comfort after Jo had suffered so many losses, and he had her father's intellect without his fecklessness. He had the attributes of everybody she loved and missed in her family all wrapped up (dad's intellect, Beth's love of music and saintliness, the steadfastness and security of her mother, a sense of humor). He was the rock and emotional security Jo needed after going through the wringer, but that's more of a conceptual abstract idea of a love interest than one that's FELT, IMO.

Most films DO the ""He's just as hot!"" version of Bhaer to pacify fans, and it doesn't really work IMO. I wonder if they did the book version if it would work better. I think the real issue is by the time we get to Bhaer there's just not the time to make him stick.",ef4z7u

The only reason Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy is its ending. Without it it wouldn’t be considered a true tragedy. The point of Little Women was to highlight the relationship between young girls, as well as the transition from childhood to adulthood. It wasn’t for Jo to marry at the end, but that is the ending.

To me it was a fantastic friendship, the brother she never had, and he ruined it by trying to make it romantic.

Alcott is damn serious about grown up Amy with grown up Laurie. She shows Amy mad props all throughout the second half. Jo's frustration with Amy's advantages are really Jo's frustration with herself, because Amy did NOT have it easy or take anything from Jo. The difference is that Amy has always been mature for her age and she moves more naturally into adulthood. She always had a life outside the family even when she was a child. She was popular with the boys in ""her set"" and popular with girls, she handled the best she could the disadvantages of having no money when she wanted to repay hospitality showed to her, and she tried to rise above any humiliations that came her way. She saw Aunt March and Aunt Carroll as fellow adults while Jo persisted in seeing them as annoying relatives who made her impatient. Meantime Jo does everything she can to hang onto her childhood and her early youth, and IMO her absolute devotion to Beth, while genuine, also helps her postpone figuring out her adult life and facing facts. Jo also has trouble giving a shit about anybody outside her immediate family (which includes Laurie and his grandfather) which makes things hard on her because that's not how you become grown up. Finally, when I re-read the book I was struck by how immature Laurie is mostly right through. He's so generous with material things and so good-natured you can overlook the spoiledness and the carelessness.

Quote: ""You give Greta too much freedom as an adaptor of a novel and instead she becomes a storyteller. She’s telling her own story. Why name it Little Women? Why have Jo in the film at all? There is creative freedom but also a necessary faithfulness to tell a story that’s been told before in a fresher and more modern way.""

 ----Stories are alive, have been from the dawn of men. They wouldn't be personally meaningful if they weren't. Yes Greta is a storyteller, ALL directors are. Yes she's interpreting a book, a clear source doesn't mean one isn't allowed to see it in personal ways. The dictionary definition of interpretation and adaptation doesn't preclude this. Did she make a recognizable story about the classic 150 year old LW story? Yes, it can be assumed she did because that's the majority opinion online. ( I also recommend watching that great YouTube video comparing all LW adaptations on film). Is she faithful to the spirit of the book? Yes I thought she did and many many others too. Did she honor Jo's fairytale book ending in the movie? YES she absolutely did, though perhaps less explicitly than some would have wanted. Did she make a movie version of how you (and some others ) read the book? Probably not but then again, stories are alive. Did she mold the book story to suit the movie ending? Maybe, that depends on which ending one accepts. Is the ending sacrificing the original LW characters and story? I don't think so, if she only showed the editor/LMA ending then yes! Also, See points above. 

Did she make a movie that got people debating, talking, arguing and dissecting a 150 year old story in fresh and interesting ways? YES YES YES she did. The book lives on for another generation. That's why Greta is a creative genius in this context, and serves the book better for it. ( And this coming from someone who thought Lady Bird was meh).",ef4z7u
fcngdmg,"> Yes and it was done in this movie

Not really. They gave her a fringe when she was a schoolchild, then pulled her hair back when she was an adult. That was it. Sure, she acted ""childlike"" when younger, but visually there was little difference. There was a lot more they could have done, and I am sure the make-up department were itching to show off their skills, but presumably the director vetoed it for reasons that are unclear.",ef4z7u
fc1zjl1,"timothee is not a darling of this sub, lol.

the body language and physicality of his elio and laurence alone are completely different. and besides that, an actor does not require complete transformations to be ""immersed"" in the role. take julianne moore for example. she never relies on overt and obvious physical transformations, but she is able to get into the headspaces of her character and give performances that are not only natural but incredibly lived-in. chalamet, and other talented actors, do the same.",ef4z7u
fc1zfe5,"Of course I'm challenging it. I'm disagreeing with you, bringing evidence to back up what I'm saying and asking you to reflect further.

I have no connection to the film other than I just saw it and wanted to discuss it? I have only responded to you and one other person and in the case of that other person, it was to ensure they had understood the somewhat complex ending as I can see how it could easily fly over people's heads.

fcucgj0,"LOL you are so funny!!! full disclosure... I hated young Amy in the Winona Ryder version.  Because she was a brat.  But as she got older, she was fine.

I think the issue with the Amy character is we basically see her get all of Jo's opportunities or opportunities that were initially presented as belonging to Jo...IE Paris, Laurie, etc. and she just seems to stumble into them which is sort of annoying.

So she's fine to me but her and Laurie are written as basically a writer who didn't know what to do with two characters dumping them both together.  I never see their chemistry together.  Also it's pretty obvious Laurie is settling for her so that's not so great",ef4z7u

And, as mentioned, *TO ME* these characters have very similar mannerisms and, even though *played* differently, still feel way more like an actor than a character. You and the other guy keep bringing up the same examples I've used in my evaluation of the guy to create my opinion on him.",ef4z7u
fc1zl53,"That's fair. I guess you can say you're challenging it but I haven't really encountered any challenging substance to take in mind.

I don't hate them at all, but they do have faults that I believe have been largely fixed by what has been done to the structure here. The 1994 version for instance is indeed more emotional but the second half is nowhere near as good as the first, because Laurie and Amy are totally stale together, whereas Laurie and Jo have built up such a great dynamic that you are rooting for.",ef4z7u

But it's the only branch you have left to hang on here. I see this far too often with any attempt at critical discussion in this sub. I addressed my view, discussed my opinion, and gave examples.

fc4r0oz,"That most people do not? You only have to do a quick Google search to see how unhappy people have been for centuries about Jo and Laurie not ending up together. 

I'm not sure how you don't understand, as I've explained it pretty clearly. But I'll try again.

The first half of the story chronologically details Jo and Laurie meeting and forming a strong bond. In the adaptations this has often been the most developed relationship on screen, other than those between the sisters themselves. Naturally, when people read about this kind of bond between a boy and a girl, they start to root for them to be together. Then at the same time this is going on, we have Amy being at odds with Jo, acting like a brat and burning her manuscript. We finally get to a point where Laurie proposes to Jo and she says no. She then goes on to marry someone significantly older than her that we've never met before while Laurie ends up with Amy who has been so awful to Jo. By mixing the timelines, we know Jo and Laurie won't end up together, so we don't have that hope. We also can see the developing romantic bond between older Amy and Laurie right from the beginning and we get to know her immediately as an adult, not just the bratty child. Therefore, it's much easier to root for - or at least accept - their relationship and likewise the same with Jo and the Professor.

I didn't find any glaring faults with the structure, we clearly disagree on that. I have noted that the 1994 adaptation is more emotional, but this one still made me cry multiple times, so it's not like I found it lacking of that.",ef4z7u
fc217yj,"The best way to deal with people who have, as I stated, a tenuous grasp on reading comprehension is through repetition. And, again, it's futile and tiresome so therefore I'm through here. I've presented my opinion, stated *why* I feel that way. It's not a complex line of discourse established here; it *should* be pretty simple for you to follow. Might I recommend starting from the top and giving it another read-through? That might be helpful for you. Anyways, I'm through here.",ef4z7u

It has good reviews now but I doubt it will be seen in such a positive light five years from now when it's not shiny and new. We just live in a time when people want to praise the work of a female director because there are so few and are willing to turn a blind eye to some pretty obvious faults.

Your criticism is childish because it relies on identifying with the characters, which isn't how a sophisticated audience views a story.",ef4z7u
fc5ud3f,"And I'm doing the exact same with the novel. You don't agree with what I perceive to be a fault and I don't agree with what you perceive to be a fault.

Nonsense. There are plenty of films made by female directors this year that haven't received such glowing reviews. Little Women is at a 92 on Metacritic. Hustlers is at a 79. High Life and the Nightingale are at a 77. Queen & Slim is at a 75. Honey Boy is at a 73. Harriet is at a 66. Fast Color is at a 64. Charlie's Angels is at a 52. I could go on.

Little Women also has excellent audience ratings. 92% on RT, 4.4 out of 5 on Letterboxd, 8.1 on IMDb. 

It's incredibly offensive to dismiss someone's achievement as being due to their gender (or race and so on) just because YOU don't agree with the praise. The world doesn't revolve around your opinions.",ef4z7u
fc5v4oo,"Little Woman has also only been out for two days, so it's not really a fair comparison... more reviews will come out and the rating will fall,  and you're right that films about the problems of white women are probably overpraised compared to those other films dealing with women of color. 

The film is being praised because it has a clear, simple message about feminism, which is a good and worthy thing to do. But it also doesn't mean that it's a well-made film. People like the message, then come up with flimsy or unsupported reasons why they think it was good as a movie. The creative decisions range from nothing noteworthy to misguided in my opinion.",ef4z7u

If your point about women of color were true, then The Farewell wouldn't be on an excellent score of 89.

fc5vype,"> doesn't matter how long it's been out. All the reviews are in as critics see advance screenings. That score won't change now.

No, you're wrong. Read the FAQ on the website:
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/faq

You're also confused about how the scores work—an 89% means that percentage of critics thought it was more good than bad, not that the average score of the critics was an 8.9/10—it could be that 89% of critics gave it a score of 6/10. 

If you're going to use Rotten Tomatoes as some metric of quality, you should at least learn what the site measures.

But they weren't released in the same political climate. These things follow trends and right now a certain kind of corporate feminism is hot with consumers.",ef4z7u

That same review also calls it the best film ever made by an American woman. So I'm not sure the score of 100 is 'arbitrary' at all.
