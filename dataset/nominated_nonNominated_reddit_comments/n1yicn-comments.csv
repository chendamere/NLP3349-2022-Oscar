gwg8t3e,Worth the watch for the visuals alone. Sony is doing some good shit with their animated films.,n1yicn
gwhy58v,"The robots easily could have wiped out humanity with warfare but decided to go the extra mile and take all of humanity captive, launch them into space, and insult them the entire time. I appreciate that level of pettiness.",n1yicn

gwh2gg0,It's so rare for an animated movie--even just movies in general--to have a positive sibling dynamic. Good stuff.,n1yicn
gwgrxt5,The two robots are the best thing ever 😂 I want a show with just them and the mom,n1yicn
gwgtmnj,The loaf of bread was worth saving the world for,n1yicn

gwhic3g,Hello I'm dog,n1yicn
gwg95m9,"Mike Rianda delivers greatly with just his first feature film. The captivating visuals, the excellent pacing and the surprisingly complex characters make this a must-watch in my eyes. Admittedly the main antagonist felt kind of undercooked since they don't dwell on her feelings for that long. The feeling of being abandoned and sidelined could've made for great drama in the right hands. But otherwise there aren't major issues that I can think of.

I highly recommend giving this a watch if you can, especially if you were part of the Gravity Falls fandom back in the day since a lot of its staff members were a part of this (even Alex Hirsch himself makes a brief appearance). I'm definitely lining up for Rianda's next major film for sure!",n1yicn
gwh2u0b,I love how the character designs are super cartoony compared to Pixar except for the furbies who are photorealistic and detailed,n1yicn
gwgqmb9,"Great movie, but does anyone know at which timestamp I blinked missing Conan O'Brien as Glaxxon 5000?",n1yicn
gwg95qk,this movie was so good!! it honestly hit my emotions in a way no movie ever has before and I think thats really impressive.,n1yicn
gwhc6pq,"“What is death” with head tilt, sad piano, and darkening background had me laughing for like 5 min",n1yicn
gwh5u1q,I would die for Aaron Mitchell. Every line he has is golden.,n1yicn
gwh8c7y,Idk if I’m going soft or what but this movie had me tearing up at multiple points throughout. Really great movie.,n1yicn
gwk92qs,"Honestly, one of my favorite animated movies next to Into the Spiderverse.

It's so hard to watch a movie about a family and like every character, but damn, I love the whole Mitchell bunch. Linda and Aaron were my favorite, especially when Linda went kickass on those robots and terrified them.

I also love how we finally see a healthy relationship between between a brother and sister. No fighting, no just being angry at each other for the sake of being angry. Aaron and Katie were the best brother/sister duo I've seen in a long time.

And can we talk about Eric and Deborahbot 5000? So fucking happy they included them in the family. They're whole ""what is death?"" question at the end had be cracking up.

All in all, fantastic movie. 10/10, would love to see more of this franchise.",n1yicn
gwqewp7,✨deregulate tapioca✨,n1yicn
gwjf2aj,"I have more to say, but the climax pits the father against his greatest challenge yet: Opening a Youtube video. By himself.

This was executed so fantastically, and my personal favorite of the many scenes in this movie that I never thought would make me laugh, but actually did",n1yicn
gwgfctw,The furby scene was goddamn hilarious,n1yicn
gwgkfhv,"Watched this with a group of kids at a camp today and it was one of the first kid movies in awhile that I was laughing out loud. It was really good and the kids were super engaged. 

&#x200B;

Animation was fantastic and the voice work was really well done too.",n1yicn
gwh4emy,I have goosebumps and tears in my eyes from reading all the love for Mitchells. This is probably THE best project I've ever been blessed to be a part of and seeing how much you love it makes it so wonderful. Thank you for watching and thanks for all the love. A LOT of talented people worked on this and it was certainly a project of passion.,n1yicn
gwgzx06,"I chose this for family movie night. We were in fits. I didn't expect i'd be laughing so much. >!The furby scene!< was masterful, as was the >!end of wi-fi!<. I liked the father daughter stuff too. I can see us all watching it again. Plus, it was such a visual onslaught a rewatch might reward with things i might have missed",n1yicn
gwmuewi,"Anyone else born in the mid to late 80s feel like this movie was made just for their (still) nerdy teen self with all the early 2000s references/memes? Furbies, Kill Bill, Numa Numa, Everybody Walk the Dinosaur, hell even the Sigur Ros song near the end, really hit me with that bittersweet nostalgia. Makes a ton of sense given how personal this project is and that Mike Rianda and Jeff Rowe are both in that same age range, as well.",n1yicn
gwg52sy,"This was a phenomenal directorial debut for Michael Rianda, and its not a surprise to me in the least. He was a creative director for Gravity Falls.

The story grabbed me, and it was sometimes more emotional than I was ready for. The animation was beautiful throughout, and there were some pretty great and imaginative actions scenes.

And my lord was this movie funny. It’s very easy to use commentary on social media usage and algorithms as a boon for humor in an obnoxious way, but this movie actually does it really well.",n1yicn
gwgftc0,I cried like 4 times. What a great movie,n1yicn
gwg6v2e,"Loved it. I was worried it would be a ""Phone Bad"" story, and there are still some elements of that, but I liked what they did with it to make it not *just* a Phone Bad story. It's not as technically impressive as some recent 3D animated movies, but the art design and animation were gorgeous.",n1yicn
gwgjhr8,"Loved it. Gotta a feeling we (reddit) will reference and meme this movie for years to come.

Also, I wish I could have seen it in a theatre.",n1yicn
gwhungy,"Hasn't even been a day and I'm already thinking of sequel ideas. I really want to see this family again.

""The Mitchells vs. The Monsters"" (Zombie apocalypse)

""The Mitchells vs. The Martians"" (Alien apocalypse)

""The Mitchells vs. The Mitchells"" (EVIL CLONES)

**Edit:** Just found out if you pause for a [single frame during the intro](https://i.imgur.com/8mDmBPD.jpeg) there's a list of possible sequels including

*The Mitchells vs:*

* The Alien Invasion???

* The Zombie Apocalypse???

* The Dinosaurs?

* Ourselves?? (Or an army of clones?)

* Santa Claus?

* Mecha Monchi?

* Income Inequality??

* The Patriarchy?

* Monchi's Expensive Ear Infection???

* The Spider Verse???

* Into The Furby Verse?? (~~all~~ OOPS ALL FURBIES!)

gwg63pr,this is literally A Goofy Movie for Zoomers and I LOVE IT,n1yicn
gwg9sqo,"Loved the movie, the art and slick animation was fantastic!

I’m curious on if Aaron has aspergers, it seems like they were hinting at that a bit",n1yicn
gwgz4fl,When did Alex Hirsch start spying on me and my love of dinosaurs,n1yicn
gwgojmt,"The Giant Furby gag and literally EVERYTHING with Eric and Debrabot had me killing myself laughing, but this movies story was so well written and real despite being a crazy animation about a robot apocalypse. I saw a lot of myself and my family in Katie and the rest of the Mitchells, and it just grabbed my heart. The only issue I might have is that the animation felt SLIGHTLY inconsistent at moments but this movie is honestly perfect otherwise. You can officially put me on a list of hyped people for everything Lord and Miller touch, after this, the LEGO movies, Spider Verse and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 1, I’m convinced they only make gold. 

10/10

EDIT: I wasn’t giving enough credit to Michael Rianda, who was actually the main writer on this film. He did an amazing job and I honestly feel bad for just assuming that Lord and Miller wrote this. What a wonderful film!",n1yicn
gwgrp6y,"I really enjoyed this. Great voice acting, super funny, and an interesting premise for an animated family film. Really enjoyed the visuals too. The animation reminded me of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (which makes sense since Lord and Miller produced it and it’s a Sony film). It was also really colorful and felt reminiscent of Scott Pilgrim at times. So what we have here is essentially Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs meets a Terminator movie with a twist of Edgar Wright. That’s pretty cool. The story’s really predictable and cliches as far as the family aspect goes but other than that, this was a surprisingly fun two hours.",n1yicn
gwhvvjs,[deleted],n1yicn
gwm0pfp,I'm getting tired of Pixar's style I'm so glad Sony is making this fresh and awesome animations.,n1yicn
gwiahcr,I love how Katie is revealed as a lesbian in the final scene of the movie and it's such a throwaway line met with loving positivity from her mom,n1yicn
gwh06sa,The moment in the shopping mall with the giant Furby had me laughing like a madman. So unexpected and the subtitles were golden...,n1yicn
gwiie8b,"Curious why people keep mentioning Alex Hirsch as if he was a major part of making this film. Other than a small voice roll, I can’t find any source saying he had any other form of involvement.

Edit: missed on the credits that he was a story consultant. Still people keep acting like he had a major hand in this.",n1yicn
gwirtjt,Awesome flick. The two malfunctioning robots were my favourite. If Sony has a few more of these sorts of films in the future they might genuinely start giving Pixar a run for their money.,n1yicn
gwg6tcu,"The voice acting in this was great.

Especially compared to something like Raya, which you'd assume would have great voice acting but was unfortunately lacking in that department.",n1yicn
gwh4m65,"I was lucky enough to catch an early virtual screening of this film last Tuesday, and hoo mama what a blast this film is. I really hope Michael Rianda makes another movie sometime in the next decade because most film had a comfy, enjoyable vibe to it that simply hasn’t been replicated anything else.

I also think it’s pretty exciting that Jeff Rowe, the co-writer and co-director of this movie, is making that new Ninja Turtles film coming out in a few years. If the action in the climax is anything to go by we’re in good hands.",n1yicn
gwhz5s3,"This movie was honestly fantastic. But I think because of the Covid delays it’s flown under the radar. And I am someone who would prefer watching first run movies at home but man, I think this would have benefited from a theatrical release",n1yicn
gwh5y30,"This movie was beyond fantastic. I absolutely love how it blended everything together, its unique visual style, the characters, the heart, and how well it integrated its meme and internet related humor. This is easily the best animated film of the decade so far and honestly I don’t see Luca or Encanto being better than it. This is going to be unpopular but I even liked it more than Into The Spider Verse. This better get the Oscar.",n1yicn
gwh9lxz,This movie is magnificent. Totally made my week.,n1yicn
gwg689l,[deleted],n1yicn
gwh65a7,"I love all the movie Easter eggs,",n1yicn
gwhzva4,This film did not pull any punches with the jokes. Also one of the rare times the final half felt even better than the already great first half. Instant classic for me and might be tied with spider verse on my favorite animated movie,n1yicn
gwgx59b,"I saw Griffin McElroy in Additional voices and man I must had been laughing too hard that I missed him, where was he?",n1yicn
gwi1d7j,"I feel like the people making this movie were in college at the same time I was, and it's amazing. 

Also, a major reason I was interested in this film is the animation style, and it's wonderful: a glorious mish-mash of painterly backgrounds, YouTube style inserts, and line-accented facial animation that avoids the common doughboy look.",n1yicn

gwmg8aa,"Fun movie! Gorgeous animation :D

What kinda irked me was that they never used a kill code - all they had to do was put the phone in water? You'd think phones would be water proof / have back ups. 

I mean, at the end it was a fun goofy movie and i had a bunch of fun! 
The furby scenes were the best.",n1yicn
gwhy6pw,The one scene where PAL was looking for outliers in the crowd of robots reminded me of a VR game called Mass Exodus and I feel a version of it could be made really well.,n1yicn
gwibd9d,I think this is my favorite animated film of all time? I absolutely adored it from beginning to end.,n1yicn
gwgqmfb,"I'm going to go ahead with a couple of hot(?) takes. This is the best:

- animated film since Into The Spiderverse;

- comedy film since... Game Night?",n1yicn
gwg5cfe,"I wonder how well this movie would do if released in theatres.

I thought it was great but I don't think it'd do that well.

Most adults wouldn't see it since they think of animation as for children and I don't know how much families would be interested in a daughter going to film school story. I know that's not what the movie is about but it seems like a pretty big niche.",n1yicn
gwmuses,Feel like there needed to be one more scene with Eric Andre's character.,n1yicn
gwgqjg1,"Why did the family decide to go 1500+ miles from Colorado to Silicon Valley after the first mall they tried failed? Deborahbot said that they could upload the kill code from any Pat Lab retail location.

You could say ""Well any such store would have more Pal machines that the family wouldn't want to fight"", except it's already established that Silicon Valley has the far more dangerous million full-fledged robots standing guard.",n1yicn
gwg4eln,The dog and the younger brother were the best part of the movie,n1yicn
gwiae4u,I loved that Conan voiced that one robot when they enter the pods. So funny. Sony animations studio are gonna kill it if they keep this style. Really enjoyable and definitely worth the time! Visuals are great. All the artists involved did an amazing job!,n1yicn
gwiw6w3,"I appreciate how the animation style had the quirkiness and idiosyncrasies of cable tv cartoons while still being very beautiful and cinematic in presentation. 

I really love Lord/Miller’s sense of humor. It’s refreshing compared to the humor of Pixar/Disney/dreamworks stuff.

This movie captures really well how we interact with technology in the year 2020/2021. Just little things, like including autocorrect in texting animations, the wi-fi on/off joke, the face filters, memes, video calls, social media...

Overall, Its a splendid movie clearly made with a lot of love... That being said, watching it actually gave me a low key existential crisis. lm shook thinking about how fast the very nature of how we perceive our life experiences has changed due to advances in technology, and how it’s like we’re  all stuck on this accelerating train till the end without anyone knowing where it’s actually gonna take us. (Hopefully not a machine uprising)",n1yicn
gwklrg4,"I absolutely adored this movie! The visual style was simply amazing to see in motion, I just loved the blend of 2D and 3D. Like if you were to pause on a single scene, the CG really looks like a 2D water colored picture! 

The jokes were fresh and to see some of the repeating jokes be used as part of the plot was funny and brilliant. The story was well paced and engaging from start to end and kinda reminds of the Goofy movie and I mean that in a good way!

The Mitchells are all great and their interactions with each other were fantastic, Linda has some show stealing scenes in the final part of the movie, just to point out some of the more memorable scenes.

5/5 out of movie, Sony Pictures Animation knocks it out not just out of the park but out of the atmosphere too!",n1yicn
gwo1xsx,Did anyone else think that Danny McBride was doing his best John C. Reilly impression as the father Mitchell?,n1yicn
gx33l4v,"I need to go off, this movie was something else. Ignore me if you want.

I loved every single thing about this movie. When I first saw this in my Netflix feed, I thought nothing of it. I never heard about the movie before I saw it. No news of it and I never even saw any reviews of it. I immediately thought it was something like Wonderpark or the Emoji Movie or Ugly Dolls. I immediately passed it off until someone on here praised it. I looked it up on IMDB and RT and it had great reviews. I just finished and after writing this, I am immediately gonna rewatch it.

I connected with this movie. It parallels my life so much right now. Katie, a film loving teenage girl who struggles to connect with her dad is excited to go to University soon to be with people who are exactly like her. She has a little brother who is hilarious and a mum who is embarrassing yet caring and loving. Not to mention the dumb dog.

Change her to male and we're the same character, thats basically my life right now. I have a hilarious little brother who is a great friend. A dumb dog who I love to bits. Two caring parents who sometimes, I struggle to connect with. A character who is going to university to study their passion. I'm off to Uni in September. Not to study film but it almost was what I was taking actually. I just connected with this so much and there were moments where I got teary eyes.

This movie is hilarious. Every joke lands and none of them feel forced. They feel organic and they fit the overall tone and aesthetic of the movie. The gags in the background fit the movie so well and I always had a smile on my face watching it. 

The animation, dear god the animation was gorgeous. Its battling with a Silent Voice right now for best looking animation right now and I think it might win. The lighting, the settings, the character design, everything about how it looked was incredible. 

Another thing about the jokes is that I think it really handled Internet jokes and Gen Z jokes so so so well. In movies like Ralph Breaks the Internet or the Emoji Movie failed to this because they focused on using the Internet and memes as the concept of the story and it feels forced. With this movie, it felt organic and funny because it wasn't the focus. The focus was on the family which was right.

The story is fun, the robots were great, the villain was fun, not to be taken seriously but a good villain I think.

I am giving this movie a A+, 10/10, 5 Stars, whatever. I loved this movie to pieces.",n1yicn
gwmcxv4,"I got some big *Promare* vibes from this movie, between the humans stacked together in hexagonal pods, the design of the black death robots and the giant floating rhombus of doom.",n1yicn
gwg7ofy,"I just finished this movie, and I love(d( it so much. I laughed a bunch, I cried a few times. It's definitely up there for me. Also, the art and animation style is beautiful.",n1yicn
gwg8tjn,"So how long had PAL been planning the attack?

She seemed genuinely hurt when he threw her away at the beginning so I assumed that's why she did it but there is no way she could have planned and set everything in motion so fast.",n1yicn

gwnwbvt,"When the killer robot ran from the mom going “No no she’s grown too powerful” I about pissed my pants laughing. And the giant furby, I was expecting this to be a cute whatever movie for the kids but this shit was 10/10",n1yicn

Also whoever thought the brother should sound like *that* needs to be fired.",n1yicn
gwgmjqu,The furby scene alone made my entire week.,n1yicn
gwhnmab,"I could just feel all of the love and passion that went into making this while watching it. The attention to detail was amazing. I'd easily watch a whole Bob's Burgers esque TV series of the Mitchells just doing whatever. Get the people who made this movie on another project immediately.

I really hope this winds up beating Raya and Luca next year at some awards shows. This was the best animated movie I've seen in a while!",n1yicn
gwn5c9a,"I absolutely loved everything about this movie. The art style, the writing, the voice acting. Oliva Coleman in particular was great. Easily one of the best animated movies I've seen in years.",n1yicn
gwif6bj,"I feel like a total grump because I didn't gel with this movie really at all. I thought it was way too manic and chaotic for me to ever really attach myself to the family or their issues. So much of the humor is LOL RANDOM INTERNET LOL in how it uses old memes (Numa Numa, Nyan Cat, Trippy Gifs, Furbies) that it just got on my nerves throughout. Like it's really easy to see what obvious bit of conversation is going to come back and be a plot point later. 

A lot of people give credit to this movie for not being a total ""phones bad"" but I do think the movie has more sympathy for Nick. Like Nick somehow sacrificed what he loved so he could raise the family, but there's so much dysfunction there beyond how the tech gets in the way. It's almost like the shift in technology between 2003 to 2020 wasn't given a whole lot of consideration. I'm guessing the mom was using the camcorder during many of those tender moments? 

I can't speak highly enough about the voice cast or the animation. Everyone was delivering on all cylinders, especially Danny McBride. And I think Maya Rudolph is really settling into voice acting playing wacky moms. 

I loved the 3D animation, it's so fluid and creative and always interesting to look at, probably even more than Spiderverse but that's because Spiderverse is deliberately less frames per second. However, I didn't really like that secondary artstyle of the colored sketchbook that would be used as a flair on single joke and movement? Like the huge ""MITCHEL EPIC CAR MOVE"" or how they'd put filters over characters. Everything about it was just way too extra and after a while I got exhausted from the movie.

I wish I liked it more. Maybe I'll appreciate it more in second viewing but something about how nutty it was disconnected me (ha) from the experience.",n1yicn
gwlo1rb,"I loved this movie. It's a great combination of optimistic, and turning your flaws into strengths.",n1yicn
gwhi9ok,[deleted],n1yicn
gwmuy5m,"I really enjoyed it. There were so many hilarious moments, but I had one big problem with it -- did anyone else spend the entire movie confused why it kept insisting dad and daughter were equally at fault?
 
I felt so much more empathy for her. It never really felt to me like she was doing anything wrong other than simply being a kid and doing silly things kids do. Meanwhile, throughout the entire movie the dad is being a clueless parent left and right. It felt like the movie tried to gloss over harmful things he did by saying, “oh, but he means well!” Really? I’m pretty sure a father that means well would at least watch the videos his daughter made even if he doesn’t understand them. And making her miss the entire week of freshman orientation… I’m probably getting way too in the weeds here. It didn’t ruin the movie, but it didn’t work for me. A kid shouldn't have equal responsibility in the relationship with their parent for the parent to not be a bad parent.",n1yicn
gwv387y,"I apologise because I know I am going to write a lot here. 
I feel like I live in a parallel universe where everyone saw a different movie. The animation style and especially the way the 3d is rendered are absolutely fantastic, but that's the only positive thing I can say about this movie. It was frankly one of the worst movies I have ever seen, maybe not downright the worst but surely the most painful. The dated memes and the formulaic plot are just minor gripes I have with this movie, the problems here are far greater. 

First off, this movie keeps saying that being ""a loser"" makes you somewhat special and unique, but everyone is a loser in real life. Being a loser, struggling to keep your shit together and wanting to realise your dream is the reality of everyone's daily life. If ""being a loser"" is all you have to define your characters they come out as extremely shallow. The scene at the end where the supposed ""perfect neighbours"" compliment the main characters because they are ""unique"" or some shit filled me with a dread I had never felt while watching a movie before. Also, it is never clear why they are supposedly losers. The daughter is painted as being confused and oblivious to social norms, she sends the uni commission an absurd amount of her movie projects from when she was a kid in a scene that is clearly played for laughs and seems set up to precede her failure. Except she doesn't, she gets accepted and she immediately makes friends with a bunch of people over Zoom. The same goes for everyone else, they are just losers when the plot needs them to be. 

Secondly, the absolutely abusive and manipulative attitude the father character displays is portrayed as being ""just misguided"", and it's suggested both he and his daughters have to learn to understand the other one. Except is not like that at all. The father is constantly imposing his world view, while the daughter doesn't force him once to change. She knows and accepts her father is a different animal than she is, and lives life in his way. All she asks for is being respected for how she does things, and to have the room for growing as her own person. The dude smashes her laptop, cancels her flight, constantly undermines her and violates her self determination. A sad backstory of him not being able to realise his own dreams doesn't justify him undermining and gaslighting his daughter like that. I hated that their conflict was portrayed as them being equally at fault. 

But because you can't complain about something without offering a solution, at least partial, here's what I propose. Basically play the movie almost verbatim as it happens, except have the apocalypse plot be just the movie the daughter sends her uni as a submission. Don't have the dad cancel her flight after breaking her laptop, have him feel genuinely bad about this and offer her to drive around the state while filming her dream project - but reveal this just at the end of the movie. Maybe she always wanted to make an action-comedy epic about the robot apocalypse but never could due to lack of resources. By showing that the dad is finally willing to learn about her passions and her dream job, the message goes from being ""accept abusive shit your family does"" to ""give a shot to the generation you don't understand"". All the nonsense that happens in the plot and all the things the movie gets wrong about technology are suddenly justified and the message becomes much more positive. 

Also cut the boomer meme shit. The girl is supposed to be a Z gen and should be laughing at deep fried nonsense and Dababy turning people into convertibles, not bottom text impact memes and rage comics from fucking 2009",n1yicn
gwi8qwk,"I feel I’m definitely in the minority here… I didn’t enjoy this movie that much even though I really wanted to. I loved the voice acting and the art though! I laughed out loud a few times as well. The story on the other hand, while I know what it tries to say, didn’t click for me. 

I saw a comment from someone involved with the movie and I want to say… don’t care about my personal opinion and congrats on making such a well received (97% on rt) movie!",n1yicn
gwim68n,"The animation was gorgeous, I love how it looked like a mix of 2D and 3D animation. This was alsofist time in a long time when I audibly laughed multiple times during a movie. The Furby scene and when PAL got angry had me rolling. 

I also liked the sublety of Katie being gay/bi. Like other people have commented, so often, characters being gay/coming out makes up their entire character arc. So it was nice seeing a LGBT character depicted so normally. 

I would've loved to see this in theatres. Definitely one of the best films of the year (so far, of course).",n1yicn
gwkkebk," Writer/directors Michael Rianda and Jeff Rowe have created a brilliantly funny but very realistic dysfunctional family in a story that is as hilarious as it is bizarre with amazing animation and an excellent collection of voice actors - special shout-out to Mays Rudolph as the most badass public school teacher *""I am Linda Mitchell, mother of two. Look upon me in fear!""* - and the overall message is simply rock-solid and heartwarming. Once again Sony Animation knocks it out of the park.

Basically, this is the film that Will Smith's **I, Robot** wishes it was.",n1yicn

gwg4qv0,I really liked it but does contemporary references take anyone else out of it? Like the cat filter for instance.,n1yicn
gwghfpd,"This could've been a sappy, heavy-handed mess but it was SO fun. Managed to have a message about moderating your tech use but without seeming like an old man yelling at a cloud.

Olivia Colman was amazing. The scene where she flops around angrily on the table had me rolling.

Also the scene where all the Wifi got turned off lmfao.

How does everyone feel about the script throwing in a gay protagonist at the end? On one hand representation is cool but it also felt a bit like point-scoring because we never actually saw that relationship. Not saying the film \*needed\* a relationship plot but it just felt a bit tacked on for what so many people were calling ""groundbreaking."" Considering how averse studios are to putting upfront gay relationships in their movies I really want to see more of that in general.",n1yicn
gwiy03e,"I really wanted to enjoy this film more than I did. The visuals are amazing and they impressed me the whole runtime.

However it took a long time for the humour to really click, it was only around when the defective robots came in that I started findings things funny, possibly that's because that's when they started making the humour a little less themed around memes and youtube videos.

The film is also too long, you get to the end of the mall scene and you're barely halfway through the film. It goes at breakneck speed at some points then seems to randomly slow to a crawl. The roadtrip side of things, as well as the build up to the robot uprising needed more time to breathe and the action scenes needed to be shorter and punchier. 

I also couldn't help but notice just how the father-daughter relationship played out so similar to the father-son relationship in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (complete with an extremely similar ""father operates a computer"" scene). Comparing the two films highlights the biggest problem that hampered my enjoyment of the film. Katie isn't a screw up, she's super talented, seemingly millions love her videos, she got into her choice of university effortlessly, all her plans are great and work until someone else messes them up. As the narrator, it's kinda hard to feel too much for her when the road trip is literally the only 'sacrifice' she has to make in her life. What she says in the gas station makes it hard to like her, even if she feels bad for it later on. Does she ever even show any flaws outside of her hating her dad?

The father on the other hand is a clumsy screw up, is making an effort the whole film but mostly failing. He shows the most growth, makes the most sacrifices and makes the most lifestyle changes at the end in order to lessen the distance. Going back to Cloudy, both the father and son are big screwups and it feels they meet in the middle at the end, it's more touching and makes the characters more likeable.

The brother is ruined by terrible casting, hearing a grown man's voice coming out of his mouth never stopping being distracting which is a shame as the character was otherwise great.

Ultimately I loved just looking at the film but I found myself going through the film trying desperately to force myself to enjoy the other aspects more.",n1yicn
gwk6ty3,"That was an amazing movie. Got some heavy Gravity Falls vibes at times (as expected), and also some light Life is Strange vibes. The dog reminded me ~~a bit~~ a lot of Guts from Kill la Kill.

gwnybbb,"I liked this a lot. It's really funny and the art direction is amazing. A bonus is that the family in the movie is from my area! It was neat to catch some of the small details, like local billboards. 

I do think in it's attempt to say that not all families are perfect, it's still showing a ""perfect un-perfect"" family by having a typical family unit - both a loving mom and dad, and sibling. As a kid of divorce, whose siblings don't really get a long, I didn't really relate.

But as an art, it was a really great movie. I hope Sony Animation continues with this crew, because they definitely have a unique style and vision. I'm looking forward to Spiderverse 2.",n1yicn
gwvyj4g,"I liked the film, but not as much as everyone else.

A lot of it felt familiar, such as the dad working a computer scene from Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and the family reminded me of a less wacky Bob's Burgers.

I also felt the tone was a bit weird with lots of cartoon physics, it was hard to gage when someone was in danger or not. I feel Cloudy pulled this off much better with a similar level of silliness.

Despite the comments above I loved the animation and most of the performances and I'm glad other people appreciated it more than me. I'd definitely like to see more.",n1yicn
gy73wzz,"It didnt click to me honestly. While the visuals were incredible and it has a good message, the jokes arent fun and the story feels predictable and cliche.

gwprfhj,"My hubby and son LOVED it. Disclaimer: I'm not into most kids films so I'm NOT the target audience at all. My hubby and son are and they give it 10/10. 

If I could still say something despite not being the target audience. I wish there would have been less emphasis on family and more on community. The whole ""we're a family, we are a tribe"" stuff seems non inclusive and so, well, Hollywood. I prefer community based things not cult obsession with family. Like when the dad was so depressed when his teenaged daughter said something rude he could have been like ""she's a teen duh"". Instead she was super apologetic and he completely lost his shit? I say, let teens be teens. The whole dynamic between the daughter and dad was icky. 

And, the dad sacrificed his dream house for his daughter but well it sends the wrong message when he doesn't reach for his own dreams and build the house later in the movie. The best thing you can do for your child is live a fulfilled life, not suffer by constantly sacrificing hoping for your child's love in return for ""all that you sacrificed"". 

Family is NOT everything. It's not OK for a dad to cancel a daughter's flight to her 1st day of college without her consent.

gwvsecu,"This movie was honestly just a cringy, out of touch, soulless cash-grab. 

First off, there were a couple things I liked. There were some genuinely funny jokes, specifically the in-flight video with the dead-pan evil robot, the music was pretty good, and the relationship between Katie and Aaron was genuinelly pretty good and it didn't feel forced.

Sadly, I can't say the same for the rest of the movie. 

First off, the plot is basic. Family is dysfunctional, Katie is leaving, they end up on a road trip, the end of the world starts, they keep moving towards the goal with some adversary along the way, they split up halfway through the movie, they reconcile and save the day. Its the same recycled plot that every single animated movie has nowadays (with exceptions).

The jokes fucking suck. This entire movie is r/fellowkids material. All of the attempts at relatable meme humor are a decade old. I saw actual fucking troll faces and nyan cats in this movie. The jokes that *aren't* meme related are either boomer humor (I'm honestly surprised there wasn't a ""I cannot swipe book father"" joke) or the same jokes that I have seen in *every* animated movie. 

""Haha, pug look funny'""

""Haha, mommy angry""

Oh, and my least favorite joke that is employed every single second in this movie: *split second punchline followed by immediate loud noise and fast movement*. Think of Vine comedy but bad. Or worse depending on how you view Vine comedy.

This movie has a fucking terrible message. Go to r/phonesbad or r/im14andthisisdeep and you basically have the movie. They even have the stupid scene where everyone is sitting at the table on their phones. Another scene where the wifi gets shut off and everyone goes berserk and reverts to tribes. I physically had to get up and shake off the cringe I got from that scene.

The family message is pretty terrible as well, if not just very basic. Girl is different. Dad no likey. Through hardship they learn to love each other. Movie over. This irks me on a more personal level as my relationship with my family is quite strained to say the least (death threats, physical abuse, homophobia, etc.) and seeing the whole ""you just need to try harder"" message made me want to scream. If your family refuses to accept you for who you are YOU ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO DO ANYTHING TO FIT INTO THEIR VIEWS. Granted the movie showed the dad changing more than the daughter, but my message still stands.

As for the animation, I was kind of disappointed. I thought it looked cool but as soon as i started watching I realized it was just an illumination movie with a Spiderverse filter. I imagine Sony is gonna keep doing that. Oh right! Sony!

So basically, the whole ""corporations bad"" message is fucking ironic considering that SONY made this movie. There is so much fucking Sony product placement that I couldn't help but feel guilty for watching on a PS4.

Speaking of filters, the cringiest part were the scenes where some kind of filter was the joke. The cat filter, the gibbon filter, were just fucking atrocious. Last time anybody was joking about filters was 2015-16.

Final note, I just wanna say that either Sony or Netflix has clearly done the most ironic thing and used a bunch of fucking bots to make themselves look better. So many one-note 10 star reviews. I've seen people say this movie deserves a FUCKING OSCAR!!!!! 

In conclusion, this movie was fucking terrible, and I honestly hated every 2 hours of it.",n1yicn
gwiilyh,"It was fine, the humor felt really forced and heavy handed to me, but the animation alone is worth your time.

gwp2may," It felt like I needed to upgrade my ADHD to keep up with this movie. 

I liked some of the humor, and the family was likable, but the majority of the movie was flawed. The story was extremely cookie cutter, the style of storytelling was derivative of many other movies, and the jokes were very bad, with way too many jokes forced or explained needlessly (The movie takes every chance to add the cinematic version of someone going ""Ehh? Ehh"" when they want you to laugh). 

However, the absolute worst part was the editing. I started counting how long scenes were in my head around the first car chase, and rarely was a scene longer than 3 seconds. It was actually very hard to keep up with what is going on, and it didn't feel natural. This is a big problem with a normal movie, but it is devastating when your movie is composed of intricate, layered shots with lots of sight gags. I unfortunately could not appreciate much of it.

This is all extremely ironic given this is a movie about an amateur film creator with dreams of going to film school. That's exactly who it felt like was directing this.

gwi3doz,"I love the animation style, Gravity Falls, Lord Miller, and Alex Hirsch. But I have to say what I truly feel...

This sucks. Like, this legitimately sucks. It really is just a boomer story throughout. Every single forced internet meme, every predictable trope, every quirky “we’re not like other families” scene... just filled me with nothing. Emptiness. This movie is so beautiful on the surface and I had such high hopes for this, but let’s be real: take away the visual style, and this movie has nothing but tired jokes and vague platitudes. It places equal blame for the family dysfunction on both the dad and the daughter, even though the dad is clearly the problem. If you’ve seen any “boomers afraid of/getting used to technology” story, you’ve seen this movie. It had GLIMPSES of promise, but these glimpses never fully materialized into anything deeper than “appreciate your family.” A Goofy Movie did this story, and did it so much better. I hope people legitimately do love this movie and aren’t just riding the hype train, bc this was just not for me.

Anyone remember that animated movie Home? This movie was really like that to me. Also cloudy with a chance of meatballs.

gzjd8yb,"It's interesting that the comments in this thread are split between glowing positivity or downright hatred. 

The biggest issue this film has is that a lot of the meme humor it employs is already dated and will become more dated as time goes on. I do think the main character works as a delivery vehicle for this humor though. The relationship dynamic between Katie and Aaron feels very grounded. Like, it's almost uncanny to watch since the two characters are like a spitting image my girlfriend's siblings down to the meme sharing and everything. I think if you're the type of person that likes ""fresh"" memes, you're going to have a rough time with this one. A lot of those jokes were already so out-of-date. It's going to age terribly. 

That being said, there's a smattering of great jokes throughout the film. I understand that it's only produced by Lord and Miller, but it has the same DNA as The Lego Movie. It has  lot of snappy, tongue-in-cheek dark jokes that are aimed at adults. It is also balancing that with a lot of ""mom"" humor - the pug jokes being the main one. The comedy is casting a very wide net in its attempt to appeal to all audiences. I think it does so successfully.

Other than that, I do think it's outright gorgeous to look at. The actions scenes have this cartoony fluidity that felt very fresh. It doesn't attempt to ground itself in any kind of reality. Like, yeah, there's no stakes in this movie and the characters are never in any real danger, but there doesn't need to be. It's a cartoon and it works on cartoon logic.

Additionally, the voice work here is phenomenal. Don't think anyone gave a bad performance. Abbi Jacobson is just pleasant to listen to. I want to give a big shout out to Beck Bennet who played a lot of the robots. He also played Launchpad McQuack in the DuckTales reboot and did a great job with that as well. I see a lot of voice work in his future.",n1yicn

gwiu6po,"I can see that this is objectively a good movie maybe, but I hated it. It felt very gen Z for some reason, like this was about gen Z daughter versus gen X dad. The weird thing is this is definitely not written by a gen Z person with a gen X dad, so I'm not sure why it feels like they nailed gen Z. In any case, I didn't find any of it relatable. I'm a millennial and call me a dinosaur but when I graduated high school I had friends and I didn't feel alienated from all my classmates for being different. It's like even if we had differences we tried to make it work with the people who were there.

I feel like gen Z is more likely to have zero friends in person and find ""their people"" online. Just think about the rise of streamers who spend their Friday night home alone streaming their hobbies out to the world. These people are considered the cool kids now. When I was a teenager, you didn't want to be caught home on a Friday night, you had to pretend you had friends to go to. Another thing is that gen Z seems closer to their family. Even though the girl is at odds with her dad in this movie, she seems to have a close relationship with her mom and her brother. My older brothers hated my guts well beyond their departure for college (think Malcolm in the Middle).",n1yicn

The story, the characters and even the setting all tied in nicely. Hopefully, we'll see more from Sony.",n1yicn
gwnq1s0,"Absolutely adored this movie! Loved it as much as Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse. Well done, Sony Animation",n1yicn
gwox9nj,"I'm a 30 year old father of two and this movie had me laughing one moment and crying the next. Surprising amount of heart in his film. Probably one of the best I've seen in recent memory.

""BEHOLD THE TWILIGHT OF MAN!""",n1yicn
gwpkhi7,"What a great movie, honestly - interesting characters, simple but exciting plot, beautiful visuals, hilarious jokes and every now and then it pulls on the heart strings. Whoever made the trailer needs to find another job because it does not make you want to watch the film. This was a 7/10 for me but then the scene with Katie and her dad flying on the robots tipped it over to an 8 for me - such a great use of that Rihanna song. Speaking of songs, not one but two Sigur Ros songs at the end (albeit just the intros), what a treat!

Also has anyone got the source of that gibbon video that sounds like the Dad? Can't find it anywhere.",n1yicn
gwplh5s,"Great movie, some funny lines in there, the art style is also nice. Those furbies lol",n1yicn
gwppwqz,"I remembered Lorde and Miller had involvement but forgot how much of the Gravity Falls crew were in charge of the film. Nice surprise in hindsight. Second biggest to the fact that this came out on Netflix, I thought it was gonna be released in theaters in the fall last I recalled.

Wanna rewatch the opening to catch the queer representation at the beginning. Didn’t catch any of that. Also, since this is the GF crew and Miller/Lourde there’s probably a bunch of Easter eggs I missed from the first watch. Plus this was a fun movie overall to see.",n1yicn
gwqvggk,Such an unexpected gem. I enjoyed the family dynamic. Everyone cares about each other. Just very sweet. They could easily made the brother and sister bicker. I was very pleasantly surprised that they all loved and supported each other. The pig was adorable.,n1yicn
gwqxo3c,Fucking amazing movie,n1yicn
gwr16xk,I was surprised at how good the movie was though it got cheesy at the end i still loved it,n1yicn
gwr83i6,"I thought it was fantastic. The animation mix of 3d-2d was just as great as spiderverse's, and it had a great story around a family with lots of heartfelt moments. The jokes were really funny and fast, some of the zoomer/randomness humor was a bit much at first but everything else in the movie made up for it. I really hope sony animation studios keeps pumping out these gems.",n1yicn
gws5gag,"I felt that the movie had a great ending but there was also potential for a different outcome, because thought the movie the pal phone always asked a reason why humans should stay and at the end it’s not answered and pal who’s misunderstood is destroyed by water.



Though in my head the alternate ending is that the two defective robots puts a video of all the support and love that the Mitchell’s gave to the two robots and put that onto the massive screens when Rick hacked into them

, the phone will reconsider and take their whole plan down and have a civil ending where the robots become peaceful and help the humans rebuild their previous destruction and mark and the pal phone reconnect",n1yicn
gwsod0z,"Anyone know who the subliminal images were of, displayed on Pal in the glass of water, at the end?",n1yicn
gwtfrbq,"I adored this movie. Every emotional and comedic beat paid off perfectly, and the animation was gorgeous. It’s funny, I’ve been rewatching a lot of Disney animated films and in the 90’s and early 2000’s there were these attempts to integrate CGI sequences. Now I feel like so many recent CG animated films are sneaking in 2D animation. Hopefully that means we’ll see some more hand-drawn animated features making a return soon, but Mitchell’s definitely captured the elasticity and expression of 2D regardless.",n1yicn
gwvhseb,"Movie was great. A solid 8. Better than anything Disney has made recently. I was a huge fan of the animation. The one thing I hated was Aaron's, the little brother's voice acting. It was awful, got taken out of the movie every time he opened his mouth.",n1yicn
gwvotoz,"Good film, although the main issue I have that I haven’t noticed brought up is them straight up killing PAL. Seems kind of mean spirited considering they gave her a sympathetic backstory.",n1yicn

gwyw925,"Just watched it with my preteen daughters and teared up many times. Definitely not a perfect movie but the visual style is amazing, the humor hits, and its unique in many ways. Extra tears because their ""special song"" reminds me of my daughters. Hers was singing ""this girls on fire"" at the top of her lungs",n1yicn
gwyxx20,"Just watched it and I really liked it. Very good animation, fun jokes, likable characters, etc. Aaron was far and away my favorite of the group and I loved how he and Katie had a good/friendly relationship instead of the typical siblings-who-fight dynamic.",n1yicn

gx4jza1,This was an astonishing movie.  10/10,n1yicn
gx6fzxi,I absolutely adored this film! Way to go Sony! And I cried happy tears at the end. It was just so heartfelt and fun and happy. I really needed that!,n1yicn
gx82bwy,The animation style and a few funny scenes i.e. Furby were the only things I liked about this. Everything else was just rando/phones are bad humor and lame jokes with really cliche and sappy 'emotional' moments.,n1yicn
gxe7ujp,"The animation is out of this world, but I think it is just a badly written Next Gen, filled with concentrated cringe. A complete disaster. I something better.",n1yicn
gxfqor8,I loved this movie but I was a little annoyed when the evil cell phone was killed by being dropped in a glass of water since virtually all phones are water proof these days.,n1yicn
gxj0e1a,"This movie was funny, but I also felt like it did a good job, of knowing when to take itself seriously.  The scene where the dad finds out that Kate lied to him, was heartwrenching. The best part about scenes like that, is that the dad didn't need to spiral into some cliche, ""You lied to me"" monologue.  His face said it all.  The writers really knew what they were doing.",n1yicn
gxpfl4w,"Did anyone catch that ""Deregulate tapioca"" was a callback to one of Eric Andre's longest running gags? #legalizeranch",n1yicn
gxxpl4a,"I know its too early but thr sheer quality and enjoyment I got from this makes me want a sequel that's basically ""The Mitchells vs The Aliens""  where a buncha aliens wants to invade earth because they want to make earth a tourist destination AKA zoo/safari for other aliens and it's not like the humans are taking care of Earth anyway so why not, and the mitchells have to bring back Pal online back again to help them defeat the aliens or whatever.  


But I don't think a sequel would be the same? Cause I feel like this was a passion project and you could feel the love the creators poured into it.  

I fear that any sequel attempt would just be because higher-ups thought they should cash in on the success?  

But goddamn do I want a follow-up even though I KNOW that the story arc is complete. One can get so attached to thigs even fictional, that it kinda hurts when it's done.  

I love this movie.",n1yicn
gy9ebj5,"At the VERY end of the credits, you can hear the girl say “woah, you guys can’t see me right?” Any idea what that’s about?!",n1yicn
gya1peq,One thing that annoyed me was when the upload cancelled due to the router being broken. They could of asked the malfunctioned robots with them to host a 'wi-fi hotspot' to finish the upload. Especially as these robots were introduced early on as phone replacements,n1yicn
gyo74az,"Louis Koo producing this is so random lol, especially considering that he has never been involved in Hollywood movies before.",n1yicn
gz8tfiq,"Only criticisms I have:

1. They should have tied in Katie’s love of film more into the plot, like having her use specific film references to help her and her family survive (Like Scream, but with Sci-Fi/post-apocalyptic movies including Tron, 2001: Space Odyssey, I, Robot, Matrix, Terminator, etc.) And then contrast that with Rick’s more traditional survivalist training to give them something else to bond over

2. Aaron should have had more of a chance to do some awesome stuff.  Like maybe if Bowman have had a robot Pterodactyl in the lab for Aaron to use to fight the robots and rescue Abbey

3. Develop the villain a bit more, but I guess they have room to explore the character in a potential sequel.

4. This last point is nit picky, but I feel like it would have been fine if they just had one good robot for them.  The Mitchell’s are all so unique and weird in their own ways, I feel it would have been more powerful to have just the one robot to hammer home the point that they are all  ones of a kind.",n1yicn
gza4dis,"After reading through many posts here, it seems I'm the minority. It seems more and more of these CGI movies are moving away from basic comedy and adventure and to where the main antagonist is dysfunction. I don't want to, nor do I care to learn all about the dysfunctional dynamics between the characters, what caused them, and how they might get over them. This is basically a CGI version of ""This is Us"". I just want to go back to the early Pixar days when most of the movie was the challenge and adventure. ""Up"" was a perfect mix of character issues and adventure.

At the least the last three Pixar movies were extremely over the top with their dysfunction crap, and this movie by far takes the cake. I feel that Pixar started this trend and other movie studios, like this movie's, are just jumping on the bandwagon.

MOST of this movie is the characters trying to overcome the dysfunction between the father and daughter, and the sci-fi adventure story takes a far backseat to it. The story seems very light in detail compared to their examination of ""inter-personal dynamics"" and the lengths they went to develop the family backstory, problems, etc.

Also, the deliberate manipulation and ploys, like the >!carved moose and the first family home,!< it was just over the top syrupy garbage. So obvious, so bad. That >!moose!< was the major plot reveal instead of anything having to do with the scifi adventure. Absolutely hated the movie for trying to force so much emotional nausea down my throat.",n1yicn
gzbdav2,"Not ""horrible"" but kinda mediocre, I don't really get why the movie is getting so many good reviews. 70% of the movie is just ""hehe shitpost memey funny"".

4/10 at best",n1yicn
gzcm0xb,"It had some really funny moments, but the jokes, especially the Dog/Pig one gets overplayed. I felt the Daughter/ Father relationship was a struggle, and a painful cliche. The final moments, though super sweet were verging on cringey, and felt like they should have been cut back a bit. The movie overall knows who it's selling itself to and judging from the top comments they're eating it up.

For me, it was no Spiderverse. 6/10",n1yicn
gzfw7z3,"The Mitchells vs. the Machines is one of the most creative and heartfelt movies I have seen in a long time.  This movie is a delight from start to end, absolutely adored everything about it. The animation is stellar and so is the voice cast! A+ for me.",n1yicn
h05b3w2,"It's a good thing i saw this on streaming at home and not a crowded theater.
The ""prancer belongs to the canyon!"" Moment had me laughing out loud for several minutes.",n1yicn
h0xoy4p,How is this the same studio that made the emoji movie,n1yicn
h10sooh,"I can't exactly explain why or how I'm feeling right now. But I just finished this film and I've been pacing around my room for the last almost 20 minutes just thinking about my personality, my dreams, the way I act, how i've changed compared to before high school and the pit that I eventually fell into.

I related and connected so much with Katie. Her personality, the way she dresses, the way her room looked, the way her parents acted. It almost feels like I was watching myself from 5 years ago... just wow. I even had an almost identical conversation with my father at one point (multiple actually), telling him what he wanted to hear instead of how I actually felt... that scene hurt.

I've never been this deeply impacted by a film before, I am absolutely floored and have a lot to say about this film that I can't even put into words right now.

Animation was stunning, action was fun, comedy was right up my alley, the characters were all so familiar to me and so relatable. I adore this movie. I will for sure be watching it at some point soon. I think I need time to think about my parents and myself first though.

This film really moved me. These feeling I have and the thoughts in my head are not what I expected from this whatsoever, but I am so glad I'm here right now. <3",n1yicn
h1422rz,I honestly loved this movie - story may seem a bit familiar but the humour and the heart absolutely delivered for me. I also really love anything to do with characters in movies being filmmakers or being really interested in filmmaking so that was just an added bonus on top of it all.,n1yicn

h6l2rvp,4.5 stars out of 5. My new favorite film :),n1yicn
gwiilsp,"
This is definitely a potential Oscar contender for next year’s Best Animated Film category. This is one of the funniest and most clever animated films I have seen in recent memory. 


Phil Lord and Chris Milller’s sharp wit and clever gags are incredibly present here. The satire is biting, the dialogue is incredibly well written. The animation is unique and groundbreaking. If you loved their previous animated comedies “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs” and “The Lego Movie”, this is right up there with them. There were a few issues I had with it, particularly the 3rd act, which felt best for beat the 3rd act of “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs”, even the jokes. 

But this is just as heartwarming as “Lego Movie” and is all around great. They are definitely giving Pixar a run for their money. Grade: A-   9/10.  4/5 stars",n1yicn
gwi3biw,"I already had high expectations for this before, and the movie surpassed them. Loved the animation style, the humor and pacing were great, and it had a lot of heart. Kudos to Sony Animation, they’re on a roll with this and Spiderverse. The Emoji Movie era is definitely over.",n1yicn
gwl5vas,I loved the look of the movie especially all the colors,n1yicn
gwlen92,The son’s pterodactyl scream was fucking hilarious.,n1yicn
gwq02ma,"This movie was amazing. The art direction and animation kept me engaged like no other animated movie has in a long time. The jokes kept landing and the Furby attack was hilarious. Sony Animation studios has been putting out bangers (Into the Spider-verse, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs) 8 out of 10 easy. Highly recommend especially since it’s so accessible too. Makes “Wreck it Ralph 2” look so bad in comparison.",n1yicn
gwqo8kh,"The kill Bill inspired fight scene when the mom pops off, so well done. This movie ticked all the boxes.",n1yicn

gwszmif,I loved the movie so much. It's the sign ot a great film when it can make you laugh and cry consistently. I also adore how the end credits feature pictures of the main cast and crew with their own families. Just added a really close personal touch onto the film for me.,n1yicn

gwrp0np,"Gotta admit, this movie was a pretty good time. The humor was perfectly executed and exactly what I like. The Dog Cop stuff was fuckin great.

And yeah, the animation is top notch.",n1yicn
gxbqu34,"“It took me 28 minutes and a lot of tears, but I can now almost use a computer.” 

It's one of the best saving scenes I've ever seen 😂😂, but it was very short. Also, the music was amazing. 

I understood Katie’s feelings because I’m creating content for YT. It's a bit hard when you don't get support from people around you.

I liked the movie because it’s one of the movies that can make your day better",n1yicn

A little heavy handed on the emo tugging but not the worst thing to watch. The dog pig thing was funny.",n1yicn
gwvnr0l,"I just finished watching this, and it's the best animated movie that I've seen in years. Absolutely the best since I've seen since Spider-Verse. The animation was brilliant, the storytelling was beautiful, the scenes were bombastic and the character moments were touching, the casting was inspired. I wish I could send this kind of message to everyone that was involved in the movie's creation, but that list would be way too long. I cried during the camcorder sequence before the climax, but more importantly I was smiling during so many other emotional beats. That story sold me on those characters and I saw bits of myself and my family in all of them. It's just wonderful. I hope this gets the buzz it deserves.",n1yicn
gwmti5h,"Finished watching it and I'm impressed. The animation is really good.
Love this past sony animations movies.",n1yicn

PS yes I'm outsourcing my work to the internet because I'm tired and this school year is draining my soul a bit 🙃 🤓",n1yicn
gwwxe63,"The movie was great, the art style, storyline, dialogue and cinematography were all on point for the whole movie excluding a few moments that just made me cringe but that's due to the fact its a family movie and those moments were mainly for the children.  
Its a definite watch for those interested in a weird wacky family adventure that I'm sure a lot of family's can relate to the craziness of living with other people haha, it's a complete blast and overall a two hour ride of good times.  


There is only really one fault I have with the movie itself is that Rick, the dad didn't get to shine with what he was trying to teach his children i.e the survival skills, they gave it an amazing emotional importance. There was one moment with the giant furball but that was more of a comedic family moment for the Mitchells then a personal triumph for Rick.   
Also I'm not saying Rick didn't have a moment of triumph because he did but those were more of an emotional character development triumph instead of what he was trying to teach the kids mainly Katie \[The Daughter\] and their importance & that they weren't meaningless skills then by proving that to them they intern use his skills to solve something that they couldn't without his presence in their lives. It would of flowed and had more of an impact on the audience because we only got one half of the reciprocation from Rick and Katie that being Ricks triumph over the 'computer scene', to not spoil it for those that haven't watched it.   


I know some might say that Katie did reciprocate during the middle of the film at the mall or the driving part but both of those didn't have the weight that was needed. With the first one at the mall wasn't a true triumph on Katie's part as she had help and instruction at the same time from Rick the directors could of had her almost do it but fail but with the help of the family it it didn't matter then have a moment where she's alone and has to do it by herself and accomplishes it by thinking back about her time with Rick. For the driving part there was no emotional attachment or connection to the moment just a throw away cool you listened and it worked kind of scene (yeah kind of - looking at you Rick) comparatively to the survival skills and what it meant to Rick and how much he sacrificed for his family it doesn't work maybe if they had a scene or two of him back in his hay day as a professional **Mud** bogging  racer or something it would of matted more.

I think that explains what I think was missing that could of made the emotional build up pay off more complete. What are your guys thoughts, do you think that it would of had an affect and if not why?",n1yicn

gx0foc4,I was the only one watching in the house and the furby part had me laughing my ass off,n1yicn
gx127d2,"I love the animation in this movie and how it really took advantage of the medium.  Animation allows you to draw some really crazy looking characters and expressions and poses.  Too often we see animated features that don't let loose.

Take something like a typical Dreamworks flick that plays it safe with typical human facial expressions, and compare it to something you can see in Looney Tunes or a John K cartoon (Ren & Stimpy, etc) to see what I'm talking about.  [Here's a comparison of Mitchells vs Shrek](https://imgur.com/d1d7baa2-fc39-49f5-bc4d-ad017fd5fddf)

I liked it at first, then i loved it, and then it destroyed me with those pictures in the end. 

Great movie though. 

Was a little silly at the start but they pulled it together and it was good silly at the end.

gx9oz36,"It's a great  movie, i just had a hard time watching, because any movie, tv show, play with a teenage/ college  amateur filmmaker  in it makes me cringe, not because it a bad or I'm jealous   or anything, but it's just too real for me.",n1yicn
gxaus3z,"I've finally jumped on the wagon and watched the film, safe to say I loved it!

I can't think of many other films that have both shown the beauty and ugliness that a family can be. And I also loved that it wasn't one of those films that vehemently opposes technology but instead takes the time to explore both the father and daughter's views. It condemns the over-reliance on technology and social media as well as calling out those who adamantly denounce such technology without ever trying to understand it and its benefits.

I wrote a review for my blog where I go more into detail, would appreciate it if anyone checked it out: [https://namelessplanetworld.wordpress.com/2021/05/07/film-the-mitchells-vs-the-machines-review-the-most-hilariously-realistic-family-in-film/](https://namelessplanetworld.wordpress.com/2021/05/07/film-the-mitchells-vs-the-machines-review-the-most-hilariously-realistic-family-in-film/)",n1yicn

gxeh24x,"Watching it now, but the sound mix is really off??  The lines are varying in sound quality--some are whisper quiet, some are way too loud.  I know it's not my TV, as the last thing I watched was totally fine.",n1yicn
gxfd9cl,"I really, really enjoyed this movie. Sony has a hell of an asset with Lord/Miller.",n1yicn
gxg2msr,Every film is different. But this one took a while. Anything that isn’t a franchise sequel seems to take longer. It was in development while Spidey was in production. There’s so many different teams and departments that it’s not like one film ends on a Monday and the next starts on a Tuesday. But Sony Imageworks is always cranking out new films. I think the next to come out is Vivo so keep an eye out for that,n1yicn
gxgf149,"This movie will be a classic, its tempo never misses from start to finish, usually, a comedy movie will get stale towards the end but this one keeps making me laugh. For real though for me IRL, the expectation and discouraging of pursuing a creative job came from my mom the unfamiliar tech situation still on dad but he always believe in me.",n1yicn
gxgnhzx,This movie rules.,n1yicn
gxgr1pp,"When the robots send a text message about humans having to comply capture and then the next message is 'robot hand thumbs up', it killed me. I knew this movie was going to be a hoot and a half. And it was!",n1yicn
gxhaerq,This film has a lot of heart and humour. A really good film,n1yicn
gxj4m1g,Anyone else see the pizzagate reference in the movie? It's a split second during the scene where Pal is dying in a glass of water,n1yicn
gxkzbl9,Just finished watching it. Super fun movie and funny. Loved it,n1yicn
gxnjmp0,Sony just made me cry during a Rihanna song...10/10.,n1yicn

gxs1gmh,"really a good movie, beafore watching this i never thought it to be of this quality

animations and graphics reallly good

I liked the voice of danny, abbi in the movie

I would really recommend this , check it out here, easy +

high quality

gxyfqib,I am so surprised no one is angry at any pandering because it’s not distasteful like Disney stuff. I mean a black Steve Jobs? Casually lesbian protagonist? Mom is the badass killer and the dad is useless beat up shit (at this point this is a trope tho) all of them individually would make someone mad but no complain here. Cool.,n1yicn

gyc557n,"Very memey fun, gotta thank Mike Diva for the recommendation. Credits fam pics are pretty sweet",n1yicn
gyu9gxo,"It's bursting with colourful and imaginative animation and has a great sense of energy. Really liked the way it blends 2D and 3D animation that brings the characters imaginations to life. Maybe a bit too tryhard with some of its humour, also falls into some cliches, but I'm definitely surprised with how creative this film was stylistically.",n1yicn
gz7qd2u,"This is one of the worst movies I ever seen and I can't understand the amount of fake voting and hype generated on imdb, where this preachy cringie movie scored 7.9/10 as I write these lines.",n1yicn
gzczykb,The whole Furby scene had me dying,n1yicn
gzqh2fn,Just finished watching it. Time to make my family watch it. My sister did a bad job at convincing me to watch it!,n1yicn

h32wan2,Juat finished the movie! Animation is superb just like Sony did to Into The Spiderverse which i love it so much! The question is who’s the real Mitchell Family at the credit? 😂,n1yicn
h661rdi,thought the voice of the robots was Bo Burnham,n1yicn
h80h1dk,Is there any theory if the dad was suppose to be voiced by Louie CK- his character model seem pretty similar to me.,n1yicn
hkh6hky,"I was pleasantly surprised.  Although I was anticipating a death in the Mitchell family when they reached Silicon Valley (a lot of close calls).  There was always a feeling of ""them going there"" to demonstrate the threat PAL was but I'm relieved they ""didn't go there"".",n1yicn

gx2os8m,"I bet those few complaining about this movie here in reddit because of some of the most idiotic reasons will be the same ones later saying that Pixar's Luca is a masterpiece.  

Thank god you guys are in the minority. You guys are the problem why companies like Pixar and Disney keep releasing the same old soulless crap every year.  The movie is sad and ""grounded"", then it must be good.",n1yicn

gy90xc2,"loved the movie. :-) 

worth watching. most of the movies these days are just not worth the time. Didn't feel same watching this one.",n1yicn
gwhfzvf,"With this, Spider-Verse and then Vivo coming out later in the year. I'd be all for a sony animation boom.",n1yicn
gwhiehc,What’s crazy is that it isn’t even the tech itself that carries the weight of the animation. This movie was made for less than $100 million as was Spider-Verse and you can’t tell because the direction and art design is really spectacular. Visual creativity is something they had in spades even if the impressive realism and detail that Pixar/Disney dominate with isn’t there.,n1yicn

gwmf9e4,It's actually smart of them - if you launch everyone into space you won't have to worry about disposing of all the corpses.,n1yicn
gwsyq04,I also adore how they tell them this through a airline video package. Wirh dark and funny undertones,n1yicn
gwnxx11,"I assume there was a poorly implemented versions of Asimov's laws. Something about not killing, but it was worded in such a way that launching into space is acceptable.",n1yicn
gwxxq8d,"honestly, letting them slowly thirst/starve to death alone in the endless void of space (in a pod without toilets no less) is far crueler than just killing them outright",n1yicn
h26hkau,I honestly want to know the logicistics of getting everyone back home after they’ve all been grouped up in a billion spots at once,n1yicn
gwigcw4,"""My Queen.""

""Look at this suck up.""

*dying of laughter*",n1yicn
gwi6gtz,The kick in the testicles was one of the first times I have laughed at that gag in a while. It's amazing how they make standard jokes funnier.,n1yicn
gwi75u5,"Also, pesto.",n1yicn
gwn3w9y,"Usually these type of movies give me chuckle once or twice but i was laughing hard through most of the movie, the comic timing was spot on 

The people who made this have really put alot of love into this project and 10 out 10 would recommend to anyone

Imageworks seems to hit the mark on whatever thyere doing at the moment and cant wait to see their follow up to death love + robots",n1yicn
gwvo7ny,"""Deregulate tapioca"" got me way harder than I could have expected, the comedic timing was so good. There are tons of jokes that only could have worked if they were delivered exactly as well as they were, a lot of them wouldn't have been funny for me on paper, but I was laughing out loud pretty consistently when watching this alone.",n1yicn

That was the first time i've laughed out loud at a movie for a while",n1yicn
gx417mk,The build up of jokes and gags during the fight in the mall was amazing. The Eldar Furby bit broke my mind. I had to pause the video for a few minutes just to give my self time to stop laughing.,n1yicn
gwkt8qm,"Aaron asking to go to the bathroom while being chased by robots.  
And I spy a flaming IHOP , it's sad but it smells incredible .

gxkbs4h,I don’t usually laugh at silly dog jokes but look at me now huh,n1yicn
gx92hhx,"This movie was sooo good! The animation was unique and took chances. The characters were great, the jokes were hitting and the heart was there. I wish it got a theater release and broke the box office! Also Abby and Conan O’Brien doing voices is the cherry on top!",n1yicn

gwraxzo,"Now we just need positive cousin relationships.

In almost every movie or medium, cousins always hate each other.",n1yicn
gxgzjo9,"More than that, the lead character was gay.  The movie didn't make a big deal about it, but it wasn't questionable either.",n1yicn
gzl2cve,"On a related note, it also feels rare to see an older sister/younger brother relationship, which I thought was neat to see. It's a small thing but I feel like usually it's the other way around and a lot of the time there's conflict between them.",n1yicn
gwjbkji,[deleted],n1yicn
gwxxtnh,Yes but I hated Rick with a burning passion. He was basically a hundred percent wrong about everything the entire time. He was condescending and dismissive and basically a terrible father. And I get that that's the point but still holy crap was he obnoxious,n1yicn

gwo2s5b,When rihanna features on your song it's no longer your song,n1yicn
gwrptks,"Such a random choice of song too. Like I didn’t expect a movie in 2021 to feature some early 2010s Rihanna/TI song that was sampling an OG YouTube meme. But sure, why not.",n1yicn

gwire6d,I forgot about that!! That poor animal hahahahah,n1yicn
gwr0k3k,I thought this was a set-up for the climax; with the pug wearing the helmet or something to unravel the plan. I don't mind it's a one-off at all though. It landed perfectly.,n1yicn
gwolawy,Like many moments in the movie that line isn’t necessarily funny on its own but the delivery just elevated to a whole different level.,n1yicn
gwijmq8,PAL Labs innovations!,n1yicn
gwp7q5n,I thought the dog was going to be the big bad honestly.,n1yicn
gxd01pp,I laughed so hard at that. I wasn’t sure about the movie but once that happened I was sold.,n1yicn
gwishyw,"Hmm you raise a good point about the antagonist. What I hadn't thought of though is how Pal's rejection in some way mirrors the drama between the daughter and father, in that the daughter is in some ways ditching the father / family for new friends, which causes the father to feel rejection. But obviously the difference between machine and human becomes apparent in how they deal with such feelings. Humans being able to adapt and process them, while some machines are unable to do so (but others are).",n1yicn
gx0q4os,"I agree about Katie's issues being kind of glossed over. I know when I saw her ask her dad to watch the movie and he said he was busy I didn't take it too seriously at first. As a parent there are times where I can't do what they want at that moment in time. Then you  slowly pick up that he never makes time for her likes and that painted a whole different picture.   


My kids like the weirdest stuff. But I can tell you exactly what weird stuff they like.   


Then they kind of spent the movie just showing the dad trying, finally making an effort where he laxed for so long and it kind of made her out to be kind of spoiled teen angst if you aren't paying attention.  


I love his internet let's be friends letter.",n1yicn

h01t030,"I know Alex was consulting, but when did he pop up in the movie?",n1yicn
gwh46ho,the furbies were wild man it just worked so well,n1yicn
gwieknv,The furbies saying all those horrifying and ominous things in their own language was one of my favorite bits in the movie lmaoo. Even the main villain wasn’t that scary,n1yicn
gwhkcmj,"They even ""move"" like real furbies do.",n1yicn
gwl7i2e,Big two year for the Furbies after Uncut Gems and now this,n1yicn

gwhyhma,"This movie hit home BIG for me to the point where I was slightly uncomfortable.

I'm a filmmaker who's grown up my whole life with ""but make sure you have a backup plan"" from my entire family.  

I've been working in the industry for eight years now, paying for 90% of my bills through my craft but my parents are still waiting for me to get a ""real job."" 

I've asked them what it'll take for them to consider me a professional and they say winning an Oscar. Yes, they're serious.

I know,  I know.  /r/NobodyAsked. Sorry for piggybacking off your comment.  It really was an outstanding movie that I'll rewatch.",n1yicn

gyfndun,I had a mental breakdown thinking about afterlife like 1 hour before I watched the movie and that scene didn't help,n1yicn
gwrbcmf,"Aaron is adorable! Except for his voice lol

If you pause at the part where Pal shows their information when they are disguised as Robots before the Dad sees what Katie says, you see Aaron’s report card.

Aaron has all Ds except one A in Science of course.

And it shows you that he is a 4th grader.

A 10 year old with a voice that deep. 🤣",n1yicn
gyalgql,"“Dad, if you see a place to stop, I do need to go to the bathroom.” This line and execution killed me!",n1yicn
gxtladv,Bro I was with my fiance and when the dad left the house behind I had to hide my tears,n1yicn
gyg9cgq,"I’m 30 and I think what hit so hard for me is being at a place in my life where I relate to the daughter and the dad equally. I was JUST like Katie when I was going off to college (except I would’ve been way nastier to my family if they canceled my flight and said we’re road tripping instead haha). My parents and I were at odds for pretty much all time of my adolescence and early 20’s, but we have a really good relationship now. Part of that is being able to see their point of view as an adult, while also recognizing they handled certain things poorly (my mom admitting that was HUGE).

My stomach dropped at the part where Pal played the clip of Katie saying she was just telling her dad what he wanted to hear... I completely understood why she did what she did but you know she never wanted to hurt her dad either. 

Thank god for all of the Doug the Pug scenes- he was the perfect levity throughout haha (he reminded me so much of Hei Hei from Moana). I have a French bulldog so there was an extra layer of humor for me- my fiancé and I regularly call him Pig or Loaf and I can’t count how many times I’ve said, “WHY AREN’T YOU NORMAL?!?” to him haha.",n1yicn
gwtjlng,DEREGULATE TAPIOCA!!!,n1yicn
gxpfw3b,"#legalizeranch 

Eric Andre really wants that joke to be heard no matter how randomly it has to be inserted int oa kids movie. That joke was seriously only funny to such a specific intersecting audience that the fact that someone spent time animating it, even for #lulzsorandum, it's kind of amazing anyone signed off for spending the money on it. Like dialogue had to be recorded, shit had to be heavily animated, just for that tiny random shout out to extremely absurd bit from a bit of comedy that is irellevant to 99% of the people who're gonna watch that movie.",n1yicn
gx1g2zx,That's going to stay with me for years.,n1yicn
gz8ttxp,LEGALIZE RANCH!,n1yicn
i6e3trv,Late ass reply but this joke in the movie stood out to me as one of the Few times a movie tries to make a “meme” that actually looked like something that would become popular on the internet,n1yicn
gxopsz8,Dude when Dad accidentally switched over to Espagnol I was straight out howling,n1yicn

gwhakos,"It was incredible. Perfect mix of humor and heart. And the animation was so god damn cool. 

Sony has been killing it in the animation department.",n1yicn
gwhiy1o,I was 20 minutes into the movie when I stopped to recommend it to a friend,n1yicn
gwhdo7u,It was probably one of the best movies that I have seen this year!   Thank you very much for your effort in making art,n1yicn
gwiee9n,Thank *YOU* for making a work of art that's so easy to love. You guys are making some of the most exciting animation out there right now.,n1yicn
gwihzzr,I only wish I could have seen it on the big screen! Amazing job from you and to the rest of the Sony Animation family.,n1yicn
gwimf4g,"I want to say to you (and by extension the entire team) that this movie was (and is) absolute perfection.

I've been looking forward to this since the first trailer, getting more and more hype, and more and more worried that it would never see the light of day. Then finally Netflix announced they were releasing it, and they even used the old, cooler title!

Well, it not only met the hype, but exceeded it. It was everything I hoped it would be, only more so, and I was grinning like an idiot the entire movie. 

The earnestness, the animation (oh god the animation was so beautiful), the references (was that a reference to Cyriak's shorts the with Monchi video in the car?), just... everything was perfection. You can absolutely see the love that went into this movie.

Definitely buying the blu ray when it comes out. You all did amazing work <3",n1yicn
gwtjrgp,"This was a GREAT film. I hadn't heard of it before seeing it pop up on Netflix a few days ago. I was going to ignore it for a few weeks, but I was bored and decided to give it a try. I did see something about ""from the Makers of Spider-Man.."" but I couldn't remember if it was Into the Spider Verse (which was AMAZING) or something else. The first minute cleared that up, and the first minute also hooked me. I can't remember the last comedy, either animated or live action, that made me laugh so much.",n1yicn
gwzzh1q,"This is 4 days late but I just watched the film on Netflix about... 5 minutes ago, and I'm not sure if you'll read this but I just wanted to say:

Well, I don't really know what to say. Or how to say it. But thank you.

The Mitchells are a spitting image of my own family, and a lot of their issues are almost carbon copies of our own. Katie's relationship with her father is just like mine; at times distant yet with an avalanche of history and connection hiding just below the surface. Watching the film I could see distinct parallels between my life and hers, and it literally brought me to tears a few times.

As a misunderstood creator, it was cathartic. It was liberating. It was beautiful. It was hilarious, and it was really fun to watch. I'm calling my dad as soon as I'm done writing this, I really want to watch this with him, and see his reaction without saying a word beforehand. I've never really identified with an animated film before... but suffice to say, I want to show this to my kids, and I don't even have any children yet.

Please, keep making these types of projects. Thank you so much.",n1yicn
gx86tnv,"I'm watching it for the 3rd time, right after my father got out of the hospital from a second stroke that should have killed him. 

This movie is not only the funniest thing ive seen in ages, but it's also more real than any animated film ive seen in awhile. The Instagram vs reality, the parents not ""getting"" the artist kid, and of course the daughter and her relationship with her father. 

Thank you. I think this will be my favorite film for awhile.",n1yicn
gwialvz,"Thanks a lot for bringing this work of art to everyone, you guys rock!",n1yicn
gwkjdmd,"I can tell it was a passion project. ❤️ I miss seeing these types of movies. 
Me and the boyfriend loved it! You deserve all the love and praise you get from this!",n1yicn

gwltlkt,My kids almost never want to stick around with us to watch an entire movie.  They were GLUED to this!  We all loved it!  Thank you so much for this outstanding effort.,n1yicn
gwr6yyf,"I hadn't heard anything about this movie, but I saw it was trending on Netflix so I looked it up. I was planning to watch Tenet or maybe Mortal Combat today, but I saw Mitchells had good reviews and a great cast so I landed on that instead. I'm a single guy in my 30s, so probably not the target demographic, but this film was absolutely wonderful. It deserves all the praise it's getting and more. I'm not ashamed to say that I was moved to tears multiple times.",n1yicn
gwjfoy6,"It was glorious!  Fantastic and creative visuals, a heartwarming story and so many moments that were so flat-out hilarious I had to pause the movie while I cracked up.",n1yicn
gwlt3nd,"definitely well deserved dude, the best animated movie by far in this year! the pug was wild lmao",n1yicn
gwmbmd5,I don't know what the metrics are for an animated movie to be considered a financial success on Netflix but I hope it is because this is an underappreciated critical success. Thank you and your team for this amazing and heartwarming movie.,n1yicn
gwmbrrz,Thank you for creating it! I haven't had this much fun in a movie since Into the Spiderverse! I was only about 15 minutes in before I told all my friends to watch it.,n1yicn

gwngssl,Goosebumps in your eyes? Sounds uncomfortable...,n1yicn
gwqtx8d,"Fantastic movie! Honestly, I think it’s gonna be up for not just a Best Animated Feature Oscar, but a few more nominations possibly as well, it was that good!🤞",n1yicn
gwy3lj2,"I saw the trailer and thought it's maybe 'too adulty' for my son (he's just turning 6) and he might not like it. He's seen it 4 times in 3 days ... I've never seen him so absorbed when watching a movie/cartoon.

Really wonderful movie",n1yicn
gy74tqu,"There was a lot of heart, skill and good general awareness of REALITY in this movie. Watched it with my two little brothers and we had a blast. I genuinely think it's one of the finest movies about our relationship with the internet yet.


You guys show internet friends as something normal and healthy and this rules.",n1yicn
gwinl82,"It was surprising and heartfelt. Also, I had no idea that any Americans even knew what a Robertson No. 3 screwdriver was. I mentioned it to my Dad, he commented they should have had black handles if they were No 3's.

What a weird thing to bother about. The film makes it very clear that there is a conflict between generations and that the father's feelings are completely valid, in a way. Of course there is an element of ""phone are bad"" in the middle. Because phones are bad - but they are also good, just like all human technology. 

Or should we pretend that the rise of social media and its fake news spreading algorithms were intrinsically good? Not to mention all the anxiety caused by the said perfect personas on Instagram and Facebook.

There is a completely half-assed speech by the smartphone where she says that phones aren't bad because they do so much for humans. She says this WHILE having her minions violently attack a human. The obvious take away from the scene is the phone is bad, and their prevalence on the planet is (according to the movie) a great evil on society. Just like the scene where the wifi goes out and the world goes crazy. The joke is ""omg people are so reliant on technology, they are addicted to it."" This is just such a simple and lame joke, since human society has existed for such a long time without recent technological advancements, and if smartphones suddenly vanished tomorrow the human race would adjust to be just like we were before smartphones. The villain doesn't learn anything, she doesn't have any realization that what she is doing is wrong, she remains evil throughout the whole movie and just gets zapped at the end (BTW phones have been waterproof for years. It's just another example of this movie being so out of touch).",n1yicn

gwpflau,"Yeah, it's not going to age well. Also because for a movie about tech and the internet set into 2020, a lot of it is actually rooted in love for memes and internet culture from the 2000-2010 era (the screaming monkey is from 2013, and there was a NYAN CAT reference). So I think some of the stuff will already be dated to kids *now*, and other, like the criticism of tech billionaires using their monopolies to fill our world with poorly designed AIs that may or may not make it living hell could become less relevant... or a lot *more* relevant, depending how things go.",n1yicn
gwq0xmp,"Nope, I agree with you completely. Kids shouldn't be responsible for adults' emotions.",n1yicn
gwz1mx5,"As a writer whose dad never asks about what I’m working on, let alone shows much interest in actually reading it, I completely agree. The part where he reveals that he has never watched Katie’s video (presumably the one that she got into film school with) hit way too close to home.",n1yicn
gwzxpws,I felt the opposite. I thought katie was being kinda bratty and mean and not stopping to think about how her actions or words might make her parents feel. Especially since the dads concerns are very practical and thinking of back up plans isn't an assumption of failure but a reasonable precaution. I felt like the dad was doing all the work in trying to understand her and she just thought of herself. But I admit im closer in personality to the dad than Katie so who you feel is more right is probably dependant on that.,n1yicn
gyajzhk,"This is my biggest gripe too. The mom is a massive enabler of the dad's shitty parenting too. She knows he's in the wrong many times but does nothing to tell him off or comfort Katie. Ugh.

Edit to add because I just remembered another thing: him cancelling her plane tickets and forcing her on a road trip made me feel SO uncomfortable and gross. It wasn't humorous at all. I have a good relationship with my parents but I can't imagine how hard it would for viewers who don't have such a relationship to watch it.

Just... the movie kept pushing terrible tropes and sterotypes that I thought we're moving away from with big-budget films and I frankly expected better from something produced by lord+miller.",n1yicn
gx551fp,"I don't really agree, his concerns about wanting her to have a backup plan seemed reasonable and her taking as much offense to that as she did didn't. And the whole ""I'm just telling him what he wants to hear so I can get out of here forever"" is a pretty fucked up thing to say, not only because of the dad, or the mom, but she's saying it to her *little brother* who's already made it clear he's going to miss her.",n1yicn
gx4kdls,"Thank god there are people who realize this movie is complete trash. It is TECHNICALLY a masterpiece (the animation and art style were mindblowing), but the writing and characterization are actually some of the worst I've ever seen (and of course the dated memes are just painful, I cringed for sure.)

I really hated that there was zero at stake. One second the family is scared of being attacked by robots, the next second the mom is a superhuman ninja that can defeat multiple super-robots? Because of the power of Momness? How can I get invested in something where there are guaranteed to be zero consequences for anything because the family can turn from normal to essentially invincible whenever it's convenient? Literally every scene is designed not to advance the story or characters, but to pack in as many bottom of the barrel cheesy jokes they could think of in the writer's room.

I also hate Gravity Falls, it is so god damn obnoxious compared with beautiful animated shows that actually respect their audience like Adventure time, Hilda, Over the Garden Wall, INTO THE SPIDERVERSE. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was also 100x better than this. I honestly think Mike Rianda just got lucky that some people think yelling and random memes and mid 2000s era anti-humour humour is funny. Something is SERIOUSLY off with the jokes and comedic timing in this movie, they played as so cheesy and predictable to me. The other reason I found it tough to laugh at anything was because te characters were so inconsistent. I did not understand what the little brother's personality was pretty much at all, but same goes for all of them to a certain extent.

Beck Bennet and Fred Armisen were funny with their voice acting. I mean all the actors did what they could, generally.

God I hated this movie. The fact that people keep saying it was ""hilarious fun for the whole family"" makes me question everything.",n1yicn
gxlbmvy,"Okay, so you absolutely hit the nail on the head with the father/daughter relationship. ""The father is constantly imposing his world view, while the daughter doesn't force him once to change."" I couldn't agree more. The movie would have been MUCH stronger if it just focused on their relationship, and the robot apocalypse was just one of her films. 

Also yes, the memes in this movie were so dated it was incredibly distracting.",n1yicn
gww5884,"I totally agree - the ""my family is my people"" plot point weakened the overall plot. If you were literally the last family on earth, it wouldn't MATTER if a teen told a white lie to her dad. There literally wouldn't be time to get hurt feelings.  

Also, did you think it was weird how fast life went to normal afterward? Why did people trust technology anymore? Like...people are still using phones and laptops? Even though WASHING MACHINES were trying to murder people? And wifi nearly got humanity launched into space?     

There's a part near the end where a fellow student says, ""Thanks again for saving the world!"" as he walks to class. Somehow that line in that setting reeeeally took me out of the movie. 

If it had turned out to be her college entry submission, that would have been way less weird.",n1yicn
gwiuy6q,"Hey I am right there with you. The animation and voice is incredible, I especially loved Olivia Coleman. But idk this movie was sometimes *too stylized* for me.  I also didn't find characters that relatable but again that's just me. The ""heel turn"" for mom just felt random for me",n1yicn
gwkasbq,"Thank you. I thought it was fun and entertaining, but from an objective writing standpoint, was awful.

gwo17pw,"I don't love it as a lot of people seem to. The Mitchell's aren't NOT normal, they're quirky. I think the movie is still sending a message that a normal family is this four person unit with a mom and dad, middle class, and white.

As a person whose parents divorced when I was 14 and then refused to help pay for my going to art college, (or were too poor to help, in my dad's case), and as someone who doesn't really have a strong bond with their siblings, I didn't really connect to the movie 

Despite that, the movie is hilarious and sweet and super unique in animated style. Artistically innovative, hands down. Especially compared to Disney and Pixar.",n1yicn
gwr93fr,"The opposite for me. I didn’t think I would like the movie, yet I enjoyed it a lot. Probably because I related to Katie way too much in some aspects.",n1yicn

gwhmfpp,"I found it groundbreaking to me because there's a significant lack of stories with LGBTQ leads that aren't all about their sexuality and/or relationship. There are countless stories of straight characters who have stories such as this without their straightness or romantic life being the focal point, and I felt the movie did an amazing job of giving us a great story with a great queer character without making it all about her sexuality. 

Her being queer wasn't out of nowhere either. I'm a lesbian and I was getting queer vibes from Katie from the very beginning. Maybe it was the little pride pin she had on or maybe it's her wanting to go to school in California to ""find herself"" and connect with this girl, or maybe it was the fact that I wore and still wear pretty much the *same* exact outfit as her... In any case the groundwork was there and with that in mind I think it's fair to say that there's also some queer parallels in the story as well which gives the ending a solid foundation. I really loved it and it was the kind of visibility I've really been craving, where the character and story feel authentic rather than trying to pander to me and exploit my sexuality. 

Even beyond her sexuality I hadn't expected to identify with Katie as much as I did. There's a significant amount of overlap I saw between Katie and myself and this movie honestly hit me a lot harder than I'd expected. I went into this today expecting it to be a fun little time, I didn't expect it to make me cry (which is a pretty rare occurrence for me). This entire movie was a very unexpected surprise.",n1yicn
gwgiqc2,"I think it was pretty well hinted at in the movie that she was gay. Besides, I kind of like the fact that it WASN'T a major part of her character. Too often movies and stories make ""gay"" a character's entire personality.",n1yicn
gwhl2ck,I wouldn’t say it was tacked on. She was queer at the beginning too when she said she had a crush on Jade.,n1yicn
gwmrdve,"Hi, gay here.  I have been officially deputised to speak for everyone don’t worry. 

I honestly think that if you ARE gay you clicked she was gay from the start.  It’s a very “young gay” presentation.  Outsider feelings, grunge aesthetic, her talking around how hard she found it to “figure herself out”.... these are common baby gay feelings.  A lot of culture is heteronormative even if it doesn’t directly involve relationships so there’s a lot you feel you aren’t getting right as a gay. Even if you don’t know you are gay.  Like, I didn’t actually get a girlfriend till my 30s but I WAS this girl.  It’s actually uncanny.

So I thought they were planning to do a gay reveal and actually was a little worried they’d wimp out- glad they didn’t!",n1yicn
gwhp3tp,"I wouldn't say they threw in a gay protagonist at the end. She had a pride pin on her shirt the entire movie and her whole ""finding herself"" monologue at the beginning hinted at it pretty strongly.

gwmf0g4,"I mean the movie literally starts with her saying she’s felt different her whole life while a rainbow shows up behind her. It was clear to me immediately.

But beyond that, I thought what was important about that acknowledgment wasn’t revealing that she’s gay (she said she’d only been there a couple weeks I think, so it’s not even likely an actual relationship had formed) it was that her mom was so comfortable with it that she was talking about it totally normally and doing the thing parents do (assuming every friend is a potential date) regardless of gender. It showed a casualness that I really loved. Not every movie with an LGBT lead needs to make the story about their sexuality, and I really dug how they did this.",n1yicn

Rick cancelling her flight was crazy to me... Fantastic way to give your kid eternal trust issues: trap them in a car for days with the people who just meddled in their affairs and undermined their autonomy... Not to mention the whole ""See?

I agree with that, but it's too complex and kind of heavy for a childrens movie. Like I heard a song my brother played for my nephew that goes ""trust adults, adults will always be there for you"".

My brain just kind of kicks into cruise control and I have a hard time getting anything to resonate. Lord & Miller movies are very guilty of this.

I’ll say that the approach of like, “Hey this is a movie filtered through the brain of an ambitious teenage filmmaker” allowed me to like this more than I normally would, though. A lot of those aesthetic punch-ups hit the mark for me, although I understand why they may not for others",n1yicn

I went with the 'backup plan' because it was the rational thing to do given my lack of results, and partly as someone in South East Asian culture, our arts industry is inconsistent where only the creme da crop thrive. If you were average, trying to survive on 500 pounds a month as a sweatshop animator working third rates for a Western company was the norm. I was below average and on a timer, so it was different for me I think. Less potential.

I honestly can't say I regret doing that. That moment in the film when Dad walks away from his dream, I understood the pain of letting it go. But that's life. It creates new opportunities and new paths for you. Some doors close, some open. He had a new dream with his daughter.

But the song (Live Your Life by T.I. and Rihanna, which sampled Numa Numa) came out in 2008, the same year home video where they danced to it was supposedly made. Which means it was brand new at the time. 
 
The filmmakers weren't pretending the song is still relevant. They were just using it as something that would've been relevant when the character (as well as viewers that are the same age as her) were young. Personally, I thought it was a great song choice.

h1kyvcw,"Normally I would agree that adding on a ""And the character was gay the whole time!"" at the end of a movie or series feels a little performative. Like they're trying to get credit for having a gay character without putting the work in to explore that part of the character/avoid upsetting unprogressive people too much. But in this movie I really felt like the focus of the film was on family. So it made sense not to explore a romantic interest or whatever too much. And there were not too subtle breadcrumbs dropped throughout the film. Like her pride pin, her talk about finding out who she was/maybe some of the outfit choices and how focused she seemed in meeting Jade. 

The cynical part of me can't help but bring up that making it less overt probably made it easier to sell to an international market. But the film was about family first and foremost. And I'm glad they confirmed she was in fact gay and had family support by the end of the film.",n1yicn
gwspghx,"I didn’t notice some of that at all, so when the mom mentions a Jade at the end, it was all ‘oh hey, there wasn’t a male character named that!’. The rainbow thing I would have thought was just another millennial aspect of Katie’s personality.",n1yicn

I think people were upset about Onward’s LGBT character because it was hyped up, and when you saw the movie it’s one line that could easily be edited out.",n1yicn
gwmmne8,"I feel like the difference is the Onward cop was a throwaway character with no real importance to the plot (and making the only gay character a cop given the history between LGBTQ+ people and police is kinda insulting), while Katie is the main character of the movie and was clearly designed to be a lesbian (even if most of it is just subtext, with character traits and struggles that reflect her queerness). It’s not perfect representation and I wish they went a little further (let her like hug her girlfriend or just literally say “I really like her”!), but given studio politics around all this stuff I’ll take what we can get for now.",n1yicn

gzw0owd,*whose dad,n1yicn
gx5shlc,"That’s not really how he presented it though. He said(after not even being able to watch her video without visibly cringing) that he was worried they wouldn't be able to help her if things didn't pan out. Then after she asked if that means he thinks she's going to fail his response was - ""failure hurts kid, I want you to have a backup plan"". It's a pretty brutal thing to say to your kid the night before she leaves to pursue her dream. From her perspective how else could she take it other than him not believing in her?
 
And then he destroys her laptop on top of it. Instead of apologizing and talking to her he cancels her ticket. At that point I was actually confused, wondering if the movie was trying to make me hate him. Pulling the rug out and preventing your socially awkward daughter who has no friends from being there when all the other kids meet for the first time is such horrible parenting. It’s actually cruel.
 
I totally agree that what she said was a fucked up thing to say to her brother, but it was mean to him not the dad. Nothing about how she acted with the dad seemed wrong to me. And actually in that moment of the movie, her lying to her dad was necessary to convince him not to stay and hide in the destroyed dino shop.",n1yicn

gys1g1k,The apocalypse plot actually just made this movie worse for me. It got sooooo common place at times,n1yicn
gwjcgnl,Haha agree with all these points! Another thing that bothered me was the logic of it all. Like why Pal couldn’t just exist on cloud and why she could be killed off that easily.

I like that it was casual here because it needs to be normalized, it's just a part of you- it doesn't have to be big. I think it's a step in the right direction honestly, as someone who's queer and doesn't want it to be a big deal...

The memes they referenced were really dated. This is supposed to take place in 2021 and they have internet jokes from over a decade ago (which is like 100s of years in internet time).

gx87833,"Welcome to the club! We are a small club but we exist lol. Yeah, I just found the movie way too simple and juvenile for my tastes. Great animation alone doth not a great movie make.

When she shrugged her shoulders at the end I swear she was this close to saying “boys will be boys!”  That pissed me off so much! 

The “Perfect” neighbors were such a missed opportunity too. I thought the writers were at least going to do the bare minimum to show that the neighbors are actually not perfect and you shouldn’t believe everything people post on instagram. BUT NO. THEY ACTUALLY ARE FLAWLESS AND THE MOTHER HAD TO INDIRECTLY WIN THEIR APPROVAL. They could’ve had a good message about how everyone has “flaws”, even people that on the outside seem perfect. But no, instead we gotta use our time to make Furby jokes that went stale in 1998. 

Don’t even get me started on the dad. He’s a complete manipulative asshole to his daughter, but he gets excused because “he cares too much”. How many times have abusers and manipulators used that excuse? The daughter did nothing wrong, she just wanted to go to film school, and the dad is the one who wrecked her laptop and cell phones and said he didn’t believe in her art. It wasn’t until SOMEONE ELSE told him her art was good that he finally came to like his daughters art. And now the weight is on her to appease her out of touch and stubborn dad?? FUCK OFF.

Everything else was just tonally and visually messy for me and I didn't really care about nor will I remember.

Visually, thematically it feels like the Emoji movie but even more corporate ADHD.

Pacing was too fast and hectic, the writing was tryhard, visually some of it was really nice but it came and went so fast I wouldn't blame anyone for thinking they had imagined it. 

Storyline wise it might as well have just been the Croodz but even more cliche and far less competently conveyed.

I get Katie is meant to speak to teenage girls rather than me, but I still found her ""Pixie Dream Girl for Girls"" personality and backstory kinda cringe.
Same for ""Dinosaurs are what passes for a personality"" brother.
The dad was such a stereotypical dad character they might as well have hired that Churdley's guy from Youtube to do his dad character and I'd have no noticed the difference.

The mom LITERALLY felt like a straight copy of the mom from the Croodz.

They basically took the Moana Mascot chicken and bloated it out into the vague shape of a dog.

It felt like a amateur movie project ironically enough for that film school but with a high budget and lots of corporate committee input.

There's really nothing wrong with expressing concern about your kid's lack of a backup plan when they're pursuing a career in a highly competitive field. The starving artist trope exists for a reason. Even if she were an exceptional filmmaker her odds of failure would be considerable. And if we're being honest, that video she showed was not impressive. The father's cringing was understandable, it looked like some 12-view video you'd stumble across late at night, not something from an aspiring film student. Everything the father does as far as that goes is perfectly understandable, even if he could have handled it a bit better.

He DID destroy her laptop, but that was an accident made in an attempt to backpedal and spare her feelings. Cancelling the plane ticket is also a bad move, but it's not exactly unsympathetic. He's an idiot for doing it and thinking it wouldn't just cause more strife, but it's still easy to root for him given that it was a well-meaning last-ditch attempt at saving his strained relationship with his daughter. You're trying to pull a Ron the Death Eater here, and it's silly.

What she said was fucked up and mean to the brother, the dad, and the mom. For her to say that she wants to leave forever at all is callous and unjustifiable considering that she has a great relationship with her mother and her brother; there's no reason she should *want* to ditch them forever, and she probably *didn't* actually mean it, but expressing that sentiment at all is fucked. And, yes, it's still mean to the dad because his worst crime is being a well-meaning buffoon. I swear, every time an animated movie presents a remotely flawed parent people act like they're Satan.

It's like seeing a book with a magnificent cover that glows in the dark or some shit and then you go read it and it's some boring first draft of a fanfic that you usually find in the end of a cardboard box, ready to be sent to charities.

I should also say I went to art school and came out ok which is why I relate to her so much. I was definitely biased watching the movie. I too was an awkward kid and didn’t relate to most people at my HS. College freshman orientation was how I met people that I’m still friends with to this day.

I'm not being brutal on her, is the thing. I think she's fine, and the dad's fine. They're both at fault to some extent; the dad probably a little bit moreso, but then he's also the one who went through the most character growth. This idea that the daughter did nothing wrong at all and the father is some evil abusive gaslighter is absurd.

> One thing I’ll say - the videos were good enough to get her into school after all. And later in the movie the tech bro reveals to the father he stumbled on them and loves them. I think you’re supposed to see her and her work as that of a budding talent and it takes the arc of the movie for the father to recognize it.

Yeah, and that's kind of weird considering that you'd think she would get rejected if the videos she submitted were anything like that one. It was, like, YouTube Poop tier. The father cringing and wanting his daughter to prepare for the worst is a COMPLETELY REASONABLE response to that.

> It’s not that I don’t want flawed characters - I just feel like the growth the father needed to do was his own. Not something that his daughter should be burdened with. Someone else said “kids shouldn’t be responsible for adults’ emotions.” I think that's a good way to explain my issue.

But she's an adult. She's not some ten-year-old like her little brother. She's 18 or 19 and preparing to go off to college. Also, ""kids shouldn't be responsible for adults' emotions"" seems like a flawed concept. If they're younger than, like, 16, maybe. Beyond that it just seems like an excuse to let someone behave like an asshole regardless of how it might affect others.

One of my issues with it is that I'm strained from my family and kind of pulled the same ""leaving forever"" thing, but it was for more substantive reasons. Her family is enviable and her reasons for saying she wants to leave forever seem petty to me. Which, again, is not me being 'brutal'.

It has some nice jokes, that's it.",n1yicn
gxkse91,"Straight person here. I clocked her as gay too. Im not a gay hammer but she seemed like a gay nail to me! 

If you’re just going to shit on someone’s interpretation of a movie (by the way, interpretations are opinions, not really right or wrong) without adding anything to contribute to the conversation, why comment at all?

I feel like I know the answer but you don’t. Give it a thought.",n1yicn

gwnjlrj,"I knew that voice sounded familiar. I lost my shit when he does his introduction ""I like to fight Nazis... A lot'. Haha me too Ive been in self isolating because me and 2 of my buddies all got covid and I'm really picky usually with movies to the point where I can't decide if I want to watch something and legit will spend an hour searching for something, finding it and then wondering if there's something better lol. So far, I watched all three how to train your dragon movies, the Lego movie 2, Shrek 2, and into the spiderverse, Shrek 2 has so much adult humour that I did not understand when I was a kid and holy shit it's way funnier than it was when I was a kid. All of these movies I've listed have really well done adult humour. I usually watch horror or adult comedies so I'm really digging this nostalgia trip. Sorry for the rant haha. If you had any more recommendations in terms of CGI animated movies that would be cool",n1yicn

gwpv38y,"So you don't like it when movies focus on one concept? And besides, are there that many scenes in this movie that address this concept?",n1yicn
gx5srrg,"I'm just calling out your hypocritical bullshit and enjoying seeing you dig your heels. Essentially,  you're ok with a white Jewish man speaking in stereotypical broken Mexican English, but somehow find offense to a black character portrayed as a technological genius. 



Sure buddy.",n1yicn

gwnm260,"Don't apologize, I'll talk about movies all day lol. I've watched so much crap since Covid. Movies and tv shows I've been meaning to watch, stuff I haven't seen in years, new movies. I feel like I've seen everything at this point lol. Lego Movie 2 I liked, didn't quite live up to how insanely good Lego Movie was for me, but how could it. (Side note: Phil Lord and Chris Miller were the minds behind Spiderverse, Lego Movies, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, and 21 Jump Street. I think they're whole careers mission statement is lets take an idea that sounds terrible on paper and make a phenomenal movie out of it.) Shreks 1 and 2 I actually just rewatched also. Man those movies are just solid, great jokes from start to finish for adults and kids. The references and animation are a little dated but its so funny that I don't mind. And I think How to Train Your Dragon is a great trilogy. Spoilers for whoever else may read this: They didn't need to kill the Dad in my opinion but besides that I have no notes. The flying sequences in the first one are amazing and I'm a sucker for a ""boy and his dog"" story. Oh and the way they make Hiccup an amputee! Animated movies rarely have consequences like that and it was a beautiful moment tying he and toothless together. Loved it",n1yicn
gxn05op,"Ohhhh. That makes sense. I was wondering why she sounded familiar.

Also I had no idea Abbi Jacobson was queer. Interesting.",n1yicn

gwrl7uy,"Oh my god they were also involved with 21 jump Street? That's one of my fav recent comedies even though it's not now recent. 

Yeah it bummed me out, and wasn't necessary, Gerard Butler is underrated in voice acting he sold his role so damn well. Yeah honestly the story decision to have him lose his leg was genius, probably so many children with lost limbs who felt empowered because of that. As a trilogy it's one of DreamWorks best creations. 

Might have to check out cloudy with a chance of meatballs. Then I'll have to put on martyrs to get my manhood back 🤣🍸🙏",n1yicn
gxn092t,I had that whole feeling of her sounding familiar the entire film but it wasn’t till I looked it up that it clicked,n1yicn

gws8n0t,"Lol yeah 21 and 22 Jump street was then and in my opinion, 22 jump street might be one of the best comedy sequels of all time. Definitely check out Cloudy! Somehow they stretched a children’s book into a full length movie and it’s creative, funny, heart warming, visually interesting and captures the spirit of the book. Great movie",n1yicn

gwshshe,Bro I love 22 jump Street more than I love 21 jump street. I'd really love if they made a sequel to the sequel.,n1yicn
gwvrn75,"Not angry. But we do have diverging opinions. You think the movie is racist because the characters don't act according to their skin color, or they should be made to act a certain way according to their skin color.

I said that ironically makes you a racist.",n1yicn
gxg31t7,I love this thread. Definitely check out Cloudy 1 and 2. They’re surprisingly brilliant. And if you need more Lord and Miller hit up the first Lego Movie.,n1yicn
