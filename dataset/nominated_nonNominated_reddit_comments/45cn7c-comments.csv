czwux6s,Most epic Ferris Bueller reference ,45cn7c
czwv8xh,"This became my favorite Marvel movie.

* The humorous beats in this movie were fantastic. This is honestly the funniest movie I've watched it years. I mean, the Ferris Bueller reference, Deadpool punching Colossus, Deadpool breaking the 4th wall, it was hysterical.

* The action was bloody and stylized. Felt like a comic book torn off the pages and put to the screen. Precisely the action I expect from an R-rated superhero movie.

* A lot of people didn't like the non-linear storytelling, but I was very fond of it. I honestly worried the first half of the movie is plainly setting up the origin story, then the second half transitions into a Deadpool kills people montage. But with this format, it is refreshing.

* Speaking of refreshing, the R-rating was very refreshing. This is one of the most romantic superhero films and Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin had the perfect on screen chemistry. 

* Colossus was great in action and offered some of the best humor.

* I can't help but feel a lot of the side characters could've used more screen time: Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Colossus, but given the small scale of this movie, I understand why it is what it is.

* Villains were rather weak.

EDIT:

* I love that a lot of this humor was characters saying things that are going through the audiences's minds as opposed to cheesy one liners. For example, Deadpool saying the studio couldn't hire another X-Men, and Wade saying 'that came out wrong' after telling the guy he has hard parts.

EDIT 2:

* I loved Junkie XL's score. It was perfectly in synch with the action and aligned impeccably with everything on screen. It was synthesized and had a lot of 80s influence and it sounded great. I'm excited for Junkie XL's work on *Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.* He's definitely going places. 

This is by far the most entertaining superhero movie, and the most entertaining movie I've seen for a while. It isn't the most accomplished movie, it won't win awards, but it was funny, bloody, refreshing and I enjoyed every second of it. Worth the price.",45cn7c

It immediately started strong with the humor,  I don't think I've ever laughed at the opening credits in a movie before.

And they fucking NAILED Deadpool. This wasn't Waypool, wasn't Memepool. This was the Joe Kelly Deadpool. Bestpool. God damned perfect characterization, or as good an adaptation as one could possibly ask for. 

The humor was spot on where it needed to be. Smartly juvenile. Most of it flowed naturally, funniest movie I've seen in a long time. And the 4th wall breaking was clever and witty, but also it doesn't happen so many times that you tire of it.

czzmx4t,"Here's the thing that blew me away about this movie, it wasn't the violence or the almost softcore porn (""Happy International Women's Day."" <3 that bit) It was the amount of 80's references in it. This movie was clearly aimed at the 30 and above crowd. Which is weird because I swear, I saw so many parents bring in their kids, THEIR KIDS (12 and below) to watch this movie. Forget about having to explain what a condom is to an eight year old, try to explain who Meredith Baxter is and why Wade wanted to bang her. 

Seriously, how many 80's references were in this movie;

1. Voltron (the ring in the arcade)

2. Wham!

3. Meredith Baxter

4. Ferris Bueller's Day Off

5. Say Anything (Wade telling Vanessa in another life he'll stand outside her window and blast songs.)

6. Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back (Vanessa and Wade discussing Star Wars and the sequels in bed.)

7. Salt N Peppa (""Shoop"")

8. Juice Newton (""Angel of the morning"")

9. Weird Science (Commenting on how Vanessa is perfect for him. ""It's like I made you on a computer."")

10. Golden Girls (Including wearing a Bea Arthur shirt)

d0k1070,"I thought it was OK. The humor was kind of hit and miss (mostly miss, if I'm being honest). Some parts were really funny and clever, but there was a lot of stuff that was just unfunny and trying too hard. I sort of chalked most of the cringey humor to Deadpool, the character, being extremely immature, so I don't have as much of a problem with it as maybe some other people do. That being said, I think they could have dialed it back a little bit and maybe made the film a little darker here and there. They sort of danced around the darker tone a little bit, but I don't feel like they really committed to it as much as they could or should have. I also really enjoyed Ryan Reynolds and, whether you enjoy the movie or not, I think his love for the character really shines through. Deadpool didn't seem as one-dimensional as I feared he would be from the trailers. That being said, it felt like I had already seen most of this movie in the various trailers. And I don't say all of this as a riff on ""They always show everything in the trailers! Blah Blah Blah"" but rather that I didn't really feel like this movie surprised me in any way. At first, it was kind of interesting how the origin/flashback aspect of the story was structured throughout the whole movie, but after the first hour I think it actually hurt the film's pacing. 

The movie was a little better than I expected it to be, but nowhere near as good as a lot of people are praising it as. I was entertained, and I enjoyed Ryan Reynolds' performance, but after watching it I kind of felt really underwhelmed and wished I'd just spent my money on something else. ",45cn7c

As a long time fan of Deadpool, I was pretty worried about which Deadpool we'd be getting in this movie. I was so happy not to hear any utterance of ""chimichanga"" throughout the film.

This is definitely more of a Joe Kelly Deadpool than a Daniel Way Memepool. You had the jokes coming at you every which way, but when the jokes stopped, it really had a nice romance plot with enough drama to give the whole thing some weight. That sex montage, though... Loved it. ""Happy Woman's Day.""

Really loved Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, too. They really made the film feel like it belongs to a larger world. Just moments like Colossus watching the news while eating cereal, and recognizing the chaos that was being reported on was all Deadpool made me grin.

The 4th wall breaking didn't feel as forced as I feared it might be. The ""McAvoy or Stewart?"" line might be my favourite line of the whole movie.

Didnt really care for the Ajax dude as a villain but hey, as an origin story goes they did a great job, and having Colossus and Nega in there was a great way to make the universe feel large and lively.
the only bit of interaction I found a bit force was the end speech and Wades obvious reaction, you could see where it was going a mile away but at the same time it was so in line with their respective characters it just made sense.

* Is Deadpool a family-friendly comic that they made dirty for the film? No, he's pretty fucking filthy in the original material too.
* Is he a widely-known character whose ubiquity could mislead parents into thinking he's just another nice-guy superhero? Nope, he's not really mainstream.
* Is it difficult (at all) to get even minimal details about a film? Of course not, this isn't 1985. You don't need to catch Siskel & Ebert or read the newspaper to know why a movie is rated what it is.

Great film though, so glad it's doing well and actually funny, I was so incredibly scared after playing the game that we would get what the comic community seems to call Waypool which I hated, the ""LOL, So Random"" humour in the game was so bad.

czx4l9j,"It was everything I hoped it would be.

Yes, it might be dated in a few years. The TV show on the watch, the references to the Sony/Marvel feud, and the obvious insults toward Origins's Deadpool and Reynolds's Green Lantern are going to be obscure in a few years, but they work really well now.

People can say it'll age poorly. That makes sense. A good number of the jokes are meant for the people watching it right now (see above). But some of the jokes are just overall funny. ""I feel sorry for your wife"" has no particular reference and is going to be funny a few years from now too, as is the trailer quote ""I feel sorry for the guy who pressures her into prom sex"".

I have no complaints about this movie. Reynolds was perfect as Deadpool. You could see how much he enjoyed playing the character on screen. One of the previous comments mentioned ""labor of love"" and I couldn't agree more. Besides the obvious personal investment in the movie, there were no extraneous side plots, I never felt like a scene was included to add length, and I genuinely enjoyed each character on screen. Everything that makes me annoyed at movies that would otherwise be amazing was excluded.

A lot of movies try to add to the genre as an art form. Deadpool tries to entertain, and it succeeds at this point wonderfully. Please go see it in theaters, we need more movies that make their first goal entertainment.",45cn7c

Great action and funny jokes. After that the movie sort of becomes this weird romantic comedy with a bad and overly simplistic plot, as well as a bunch of non interesting characters(excluding Deadpool of course). To me it felt like the writers were relying too much on ""Oh this isn't your average superhero movie, cause BAM!! We got some blood, and a ton of dirty jokes along with swearing!"" that they didn't bother to develop any of the characters, or make the plot more dynamic than *Protagonist' girlfriend gets kidnapped by the people he's trying to kill so he has to save her*. Had they been consistent with the action sequences maybe i'd be able to look over the whole middle portion of the film(which was just a myriad of hit or miss jokes), but considering that the only other good fight scene was at the very end of the movie(and was nothing compared to the opener) it's hard to give Deadpool the praise that everyone seems it deserves.

I was a bit bummed that Vanessa didn't turn into Copycat but I'm actually okay with them being together, because I feel like they strung out that romance a bit too long in the comics and this is a great way to condense it.

I have one huge complaint, though.

At the end, when Ajax tells Deadpool that he could never have cured it, that would have been an excellent moment to explain Deadpool's mutation, and how the cancer interacted with it. It also would have justified so much about Deadpool's origin, Ajax's lie, the physical change, and the character.

This was the Valentines day movie I never thought I would have the privilege to see, let alone enjoy with my girlfriend. I want to see it 12 more times. I was not the biggest Deadpool fan going in. I never read the comics and when I was young his humour and gore was so disturbing to me. Im 24 now and I just bought a stack of the comics.

Despite those negative things I don't see myself rating it any lower than a 7/10 and would much rather rewatch this over half of the MCU.

Also I found the villain extremely bland and boring. Sadistic 'just because', we know nothing of his backstory, know nothing about the ""shipment"" he was talking about at the beginning.

I don't know, this movie was basically perfect to me and I'd imagine most fans of Deadpool and marvel comics will feel the same.

My main concern going in would that it would be too much like memepool instead of Deadpool, and it would rely too much on a ""omg so randum"" style of humour. But it didn't. The comedic beats were good and Deadpool never quite crossed that line of being *too* annoying. Almost all of his lines hit, and there were some great visual gags and the like to help break it up.

I also like the way it was structured, which really helped with the pacing a whole lot, tying into what I said earlier about it never crossing the line and becoming too grating.

But was anyone else a little disappointed in the ending? Deadpool just can't have a happy ending. I'm torn because I enjoyed how it worked out, but it just wasn't Deadpool.

I guess I can understand why they did it though. If it bombed, then it works fine as a standalone film. If it works out, they can be a bit more free in future efforts. 

That's just nitpicking though. And there are others, but it's still more true to the character than most comic book adaptations. And for Deadpool of all people to get that close is amazing. ",45cn7c

I'm hoping that Deadpool 2 is a partial prequel, in which we get to see Wade before he decided to ""help the little guy"" but then, after fast-forwarding through the entire first film, an old enemy returns from his past.

So there was a hint that the sequel might involve Cable, who is a time-traveler.  Perhaps the only way Deadpool can defeat his old enemy is to go back in time and help his former self defeat him the first time... and accidentally give himself cancer in the process.",45cn7c

In closing, I don't think I was ever this engaged with a MARVEL this deep....like ever!

Probably wait to rent it. Not because it isn't a great movie, because it is. But because you're going to have to sit in a theater with Internet people. 

I really respect people who are super fans. You invest so much time and money into your interests and you get excited when that's rewarded. I get that. It's cool. But FOR FUCKS SAKE, not everything is strictly for your benefit. I can't tell you how many times my movie going experience was fucked up By, ""Holy shit! That's Bob from Hydra! In the comics..."" or ""Oh no way they did that! Best Stan Lee cameo ever!!!"" or ""A unicorn! It should have been Hello Kitty!""

Shit, half the theater was on Alien Blue, posting reviews during the movie. It just got really frustrating when you could tell most people thought this movie was their personal property and they could act out their shitty meme lives while you tried to enjoy some entertainment. It was the equivalent of seeing Zero Dark Thirty with a bunch of first year grunts and their trailer park girlfriends.

It was very much a cocktail of irreverent comedy and a raw, dirty, real look into a tragic character who chronically uses humor to choke down his sorrows.

It's refreshing to see a comic book film that stays true to its roots, and above all, allows itself to be FUN. Ryan Reynolds was perfect, the script was clever, the action was entertaining but never overbearing. I loved seeing Colussus get some love, but I wasn't a huge fan of his portrayal...the voice actor sounded like he belonged in a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon show.

Some of the jokes were a little too much Deadpool trying to be Deadpool but it was still a nice break from the usual superhero movies (and movies in general.)

Those scenes where Wade transitions from his normal self to Deadpool were really disturbing but well-done. I don't think there was a bad performance from anyone and the music stood out pretty well (in a good way.) I just wish they showed how he learned to fight ",45cn7c

However, this film is really my favourite comic book movie in YEARS. Some jokes sounds super lame in the trailers, but they fit right in when put into contexts. Characters have good developments(still, the romance is kinda cliche). Wall-breaking jokes are not awkward at all.

You can tell Ryan Reynolds is as big of a Deadpool fan as he says, he captures the character perfectly; he truly is Deadpool/Wade Wilson. 

If you are a casual fan or never heard of Deadpool before this, this movie is still amazing, its a refreshing take on the Superhero Origin story, it funny and quippy, and the humor is only enhanced if you know more about the character, but going in with little to no knowledge of the character will result in a enjoyable and funny experience.

Instead of like in the comics where Deadpool wants to be an X-man in the movie he wants no part of Colossus' offer. To go as far as cutting off his own hand, which was so brilliant in it self, really drive it home that Deadpool will never be an X-man because he's better than that. 

Anyone else curious about the Helicarrier? Is that supposed to be one of the Helis that crashed at the end of Captain American; Winter Soldier? If so that's great work putting something from the other Marvel films into this one to show it's all in the same universe. 

I hope Wade didn't kill Bob. 

Edit: And I just realized something, if Colossus took Deadpool to see Professor X, wouldn't that have been the catalyst for Deadpool Kills The Marvel Universe?!

Then you're left with a piss poor derivative origin story that is basically the same as *X-Men Origins: Wolverine*, an even more derivative central revenge story, a criminally underutilized set of supporting characters (Three movies with nothing to do? Just kill and save yourself from future misery, Colossus), an attractive actress that is the damsel-in-distress archetype/one-dimensional love interest, and of course, a fucking generic sociopathic villain.

There was a lot of potential with a Deadpool film, with a self-aware comic book character gifted with the ability to break the fourth wall and jab the audience in their ribs with a slab of the wall. How it tries to be satirical and commentate on the saturation of the market with superhero films is commendable... before you realize the commentary is almost pedestrian in quality, and doesn't bother to go deeper or be the change it desperately wants to be with all the disapproving finger waving.

As a fan of the character and one that is utterly disappointed with this by-the-numbers film, *Deadpool* is nothing more than an 8-year-old stale double cheeseburger wrapped in an new edgy, vulgar packaging. Truly the R-rated, spandex-wearing Jesus that will save the market from PG-13 formulaic oversaturation.",45cn7c

czwvm0l,"I thought it was pretty good- acting was great, comedy was better than I had been expecting (i.e I thought it was pretty hilarious), story was nice, action was quite entertaining, and Deadpool was, well...Deadpool (which is *very* good). On a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a 7 or 7.5/10 (note: this does **not** make it a bad movie. Just because everyone expects a 9/10 these days does not mean every movie has to have that score).

d0h74ov,"Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but I found a lot of the jokes to be pretty hit-or-miss, to the point of being cringey. I understand that it's Deadpool's sort of humor, and I'm sure die-hard fans of the character went gaga for it, but I think for the average person who doesn't know much about Deadpool and just wants to see a superhero movie, they could've laid off some of the more dumber jokes.

I also think they just spent too much time making jokes/4th wall breaks/references and too little time actually establishing some of the other characters like NTW, Colossus, and Ajax. Even Weasel could've used some backstory. While I recognize the fact that these are just supporting/minor characters and the real story is about Deadpool, that's just something I thought would've made the film a bit better.

Overall, I'd give it a 7.5/10. Here's hoping the second one will be somewhat better.",45cn7c

czx0p65,"I didn't hate it but i didn't enjoy it either. The best thing i can say about it is that it's a perfect adaptation of the Deadpool comic, of which i'm not that much a fan of. Bare in mind i'm not judging the movie on how well it was adapted, just what i saw on screen.

The action was good, but at times it was a bit too reliant on CG. The biggest problem i have with the movie is that i just find the character of Deadpool and his humour a bit exhausting. There were certainly funny jokes, but the quips per minute ratio was far far too high for my liking. And i really can't stand his meta-ness. Pointing out your flaws doesn't mean they are null and void. Case in point, saying the movie stars a ""British villain"" and ""a hot chick"" doesn't mean its not valid to criticise the fact that his girlfriend was a walking talking cliche and the villain was a moustache-twirling British villain who can't feel pain with shit, capitalist motivations. 

A lot of people will love this movie, and that's fine. But i just thought that in the end, it wasn't as original as it made itself out to be and ultimately, it conformed to a lot of genre stereotypes that it thought it was subverting",45cn7c
czwzmd7,just saw the movie tonight. absolutely... fucking.... hilarious. im so glad it was rated R also. It made the movie way better. if it had been pg-13 some of the corny lines wouldnt have worked and it would have sucked. marvel took van wilder and fucked it up the ass with die hard's action cock and ejaculated  a masterpiece. youll be forced to see this movie twice in a theater with less people because the laughter from you and the crowd will be so much youre going to miss lots of other jokes in the movie. i already guarantee you you wont see a funnier movie this year. you dont need to like deadpool to see this movie. you just need to like dark twisted comedy and action movies. big kudos to marvel for finally getting this out to the fans. it was amazing. ,45cn7c

czx0ukx,"I liked it.

I walked into it expecting myself to not like it, though I was ""excited"" in scare quotes for a different superhero movie and, while I don't think it's VERY different from your average superhero film, I walked out liking it. Small stakes for one since it's just a revenge story made it absolutely refreshing in an era of ""save the world"" heroics. I don't exactly feel Reynolds is as perfect for the role as everyone still thinks, but he had a bouncy energy to the film and he definitely had phenomenal screwball vulgar chemistry with Morena Baccarin. The flashback structure sort of made the bridge fight scene feel pretty inert every time we returned to it (and there never really seemed a rhythm behind its choices to go from Wade's origins to the bridge fight), but I really admire the decision behind it to bring us in media res. 

What I'm really most pleasantly surprised by, though, is its restraint. Making everything around the characters feel so tired and industrial to really have Deadpool's humor off-set just how visually broken everything around him is. And by just how deftly the writers and director did with what they had, such as the small budget only allowing for two primary setpieces (three kind of with Deadpool's escape), having Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead really feel a part of Deadpool's anti-arc of ""not"" becoming a hero (though I kind of feel it messes with the continuity to imply that Colossus and Deadpool already know each other in the implied-to-be short span of time between his mutation and the bridge fight), and most of all, making 100 minutes never lag nor feel rushed.

I give it a 7/10.",45cn7c

The comics and video game did that right, and I thought that was missing from the movie. In the game, he has other voices that he talks to and who talk to him. I feel like he should have been talking to the narrator who would be him but with a different tone of voice.",45cn7c

czzqx1i,"I think the numerous amounts of trailers, teasers, and small clips that made their way around the internet and TV kind of ruined a lot of the potential jokes that they had in the film. TJ Miller said something about them being able to improv a lot of the jokes and I wish they would have used some of those that were cut out in the trailers so they didn't spoil the ones in the film. That being said, the movie was still pretty top notch. The humour was much more interesting since there was no holding back thanks to the R rating. Action was well choreographed and much more interesting and involving than a lot of other Marvel films. The easter eggs were also very tasteful and even though a couple of them were very ""in your face, look at me, look at me"" they still kind of worked without me hating them.

However, that being said, it didn't feel like it was any different to any other Marvel film, despite being outside of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was very formulaic and the storyline is similar to any other origin movie we've seen over the past couple of years or so. On top of this, the final showdown at the end let the movie down in my opinion. It felt a little rushed - another redditor mentioned how ridiculous it was for Ajax to just have the same number of henchmen attack Deadpool and I agree. Maybe I was expecting too much of the movie, but for a hero that is typically known to break the mold, I was really hoping it would do so.",45cn7c

d00qajw,"One thing I disliked a lot about the movie was how poorly defined some of their powers were. Is Deadpool supposed to be super strong and super agile, or is that just supposed to be Wade Wilson being really fit? Do injuries hurt him like Wolverine or does he feel no pain? Does Francis have super strength and agility? Does he heal (I don't think he does but he sure survived a lot)? ",45cn7c
czxc53z,"Every one else is gushing about it so I'm going to be contrarian and list a few faults. I'm not saying this was a bad movie, I'm just going to nitpick:

* the climax is the dumbest plan of any villain I can recall off the top of my head in movies. Like it was dumber than monologue-ing your whole scheme to the captured hero, or dumber than expecting a captured hero to die unseen in a needlessly complicated death trap. So he knows Deadpool is nearly unkillable by conventional means, sets a trap and has all the advantages of choosing the time and location of the battle. He even acknowledges that to kill Deadpool ""there has to be nothing left to heal"". SO what does he do? He goes all out and... hires a handful of faceless goons to line up like some kind of 19th century firing squad and shoot at a guy that heal near-instantly? No bombs? No flamethrowers? Nothing that could impair his movement even? You couldn't even get an acme cage to fall on him? They just lined up and shot at him. I mean, the action sequences were great but that was one lazy ass set up. 

* I loved Colossus in this movie, he had great presence, and he finally got to be a bit of badass... but his role was ultimately simplistic and it's always a bit of a bummer when they use tough characters like him just to show how tough a bad guy is like they did when she throws her first punch and sends him flying (again, not a huge deal, just a little nit-pick)
Also, his role was one of those points in the plot that didn't in any way take away from my enjoyment of the movie, but didn't actually make logical sense. Logically speaking, Deadpool was a mercenary with a spotty record going on a straight up murderous rampage. He wasn't just killing people in the midst of a life or death firefight (especially since he can't really be hurt), he was actually murdering people with god knows how many innocents getting caught in the crossfire, and straight up executed an unarmed person at the end. In spite of all this, the big boy scout wants him to be X-Man? No, he's a straight up psychotic villain on a rampage that needs to be stopped (logically speaking).

* Breaking the 4th wall is not in and of itself clever or funny, rather it's a device that *can* be used to be clever or funny. This movie didn't make that distinction and some of felt very forced (like him acknowledging that he was breaking the fourth wall - that's not clever; it's not a substitute for an actual joke). 

* On the subject of humour, while most of the jokes were great a few were downright awful. As I commented elsewhere,  the ""Let's dance!"" ""No, Let's fight!"" line is probably going to be the cringiest line of any movie I see this year, and it happened right at the climax too.

Anyways, I really enjoyed the movie, and I could do a longer list of the things I liked, but I just felt like opening a discussion about some of things that *didn't* work since everyone else only had nice things to say. 

edit: also if you'll forgive me for being **super** nitpicky: I'm not sure how I feel about Colossus's ludicrously cartoonish proportions. And how much money did they spend rendering him in CGI for every scene? Why not hire an actor to play him and just armor up for the fights? With the money saved they might have been able to use a *third* X-Man! (ok, not really but I'm still curious)

edit 2: I love how many people are arguing that I and others must not ""get"" the character because it's normal for the character to break the fourth wall, or that we must be unfamiliar with the comics. First off, even if none of has have read comics, you shouldn't have to read the comics to enjoy the movie. But that's not really relevant because it's not that complicated. He breaks the fourth wall. That's great. But here's the rub: it can be a characters thing to tell jokes all the time, but if the jokes aren't funny then the fact that it's ""his thing"" doesn't make them funny. Similarly, just because it's a common gag for Deadpool to break talk to the audience doesn't mean that every application of it is automatically funny. You're not special because you ""get"" the character and I don't, your just missing my point. You can even just say that you disagree with me because you found something funny that I didn't: that's fine, humour is of course subjective. But it's not like the gag is going over my head... It's just not always funny.",45cn7c
czx6gas,Was I the only one who thought the movie was just mediocre? Most of the movies best scenes was spoiled through the trailers. This movie is okay only because it was an introduction movie on who the character was. Which most of the time it's not the great. They emphasized too much on romance which is NOT deadpool's strong suit. When they announced after the credits cable was going to make an appearance which was great!! His breaking the 4th wall moments were spot on. The fight with the main villain was pretty weak. I'm just disappointed it wasn't as humorous as I thought it was going to be seeing that MOST of the comedy scenes were shown by trailer. Action was good. CGI was bearable. Stan Lee Cameo was a bit weird because he had did not create Deadpool in any way besides being a Marvel character but still awesome as shit. I feel like the next movie will be better than this.  ,45cn7c
czx2h5h,"Ok, things I really liked:


- All the jokes about how ugly he looked. I only remember one that wasn't in the trailers, but it was great. 


- The 4th wall thing almost went for too long, but I really liked it.


- All the sex montages were hilarious. 


- There were many epic scenes but the fight with Colossus was my favorite. I think I have never seen a theater laugh non-stop for about 2 minutes. 
- Deadpool spelling Francis with dead people was A+.

Things I didn't like:


- Could have dealt with a bit less backstory. I feel like every time they went back to the past I wanted to go back immediately to the present so I could see him kicking more ass.
- I wish we had a final extra scene with his driver and his nemesis to give us some closure. It would have been hilarious imo.  

- I think... nope, that's basically it. I think villains were pretty ok and I don't think they were a problem like most people are saying.

czy3ljc,"God I fucking hated my theater. First of all, I was shocked at the number of children in the theater. There was a group of maybe 15-20 kids who came together with one ""cool"" guardian. Also, I was the only one cackling at maybe 40% of the jokes. No one else understood the jokes relating to the other X-Men movies or Green Lantern, and as someone who built countless pieces of furniture from IKEA, I was dying at the IKEA furniture segment between Deadpool and Blind Al.

d030xff,"As someone who doesn't have a huge background in Deadpool comics and lore I went to see it with pretty much no expectations despite to be entertained. And while that expectation was met I still somehow ended up disappointed and I'm still not really sure why. I just have the feeling that it could've been a lot better. I mean what's the point of Ajax having super reflexes if it barely ever shows? He seems nigh invincible, same as everyone else despite the generic goons. Yes he doesn't feel pain but still a sword through your torso shouldn't be something you just shake off. What was the point of the bathroom scene in the strip club? It just doesn't make sense that he would hesitate in a situation like this. That scene in the end where Ajax is on the floor with bloody teeth. And then his teeth are white and shiny. And then they are not etc. etc. How does shit like that get through production? Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed the movie, but there was just so much stuff that didn't make any sense(and I don't mean Deadpool-y randomness) or just plain wasn't funny. Like the fourth wall breaking; yes that's what he does but if the way in which he does it is not original but just for the sake of doing it, it kinda loses its power. And I guess that's my problem with this movie, it has all the good stuff but it also has a whole lot of bad stuff in it that I feel could've been avoided.",45cn7c
czyqcet,"Saw the movie last night. I don't read comic books at all and I don't normally like Marvel movies, but I wanted to check out Deadpool out of curiosity because it seemed different from other Marvel movies.

I didn't like it. The movie seemed really proud of itself and kept explaining itself to the audience. It kept showing us how Deadpool is different from other superheroes, but it never went beyond that. The whole movie was just praising itself for being a Deadpool movie.

Also, by the end of the movie I still wasn't clear on what kind of person Deadpool is. He kinda cares about some stuff but he doesn't care about other stuff, and he's violent and sexual, and that's about it. The whole movie was spent fleshing out this character who really has no personality.

And this movie wasn't good as a comedy either. It was just non-stop generic one-liners. There weren't any comedic situations or anything, it was just one-liners.

czwx1zf,"Bob from Hydra and the final showdown happened on something that looked suspiciously like an early version of the Helicarrier from Avengers (Heck, it could even be one of the Helicarriers from Captain America: Winter Soldier that got shot down). 

Now call me crazy, but this may be the beginning of Fox and Marvel collaborating on future films. Unfortunately, I don't think we'd ever see Deadpool appear in any Marvel films (X-men vs Avengers anyone?) because for Deadpool to be at his peak the movie would have to be rated R, and Marvel wouldn't make an Avengers film rated R. 

It'd be nice to see Fox let Marvel make an actual good Fantastic Four film, or borrow an X-men member or two like what Sony is doing with Spiderman. 

The ultimate dream is to see a rated R X-men vs Avengers film, but I doubt Marvel would let their carefully crafted family friendly Avengers characters to be used in a film that would treat their powers as realistic (like Hulk crushing a person into mush or Iron Man vaporizing a person). Also personally I think it'd be a little jarring to see these pg-13 characters we know go to being rated R versions of themselves. They could try to make it so the Avengers characters stay pg-13 and Deadpool's character rated R, but it would also be jarring to watch Deadpool cut a person in half then watch Iron Man blast a guy with his hand, only for the guy to be pushed into a wall.",45cn7c

czx084t,"Just finished the movie, I'll give a brief review.

The Deadpool movie was hilarious and Ryan Reynolds was a perfect Deadpool. Moment-to-moment you love every minute. The movie only falls short once you step back and evaluate the storyline as a whole. In actuality, it's incredibly generic and inconsequential. The plot is shallow. Generic bad guy does bad guy things, steals the girl, then girl gets saved and bad guy loses. We never get any background as to the villain's organization, their activities, or their motivation. They are flat characters that only exist to further the plot so we can watch Deadpool do more things. You can almost ignore that problem, though, since it's really fun to watch Deadpool do things. Let's be honest, we didn't come to this movie to watch some brilliant villain's character development. They could have almost made this movie nothing but an hour and a half of endless fight scenes full of similar witty banter and it would be enjoyable. It's incredible how many jokes get fired at you one after another, and how many aren't just funny but hilarious. The jokes do get a little exhausting by the end, and you can sense just a tiny bit of laziness or perhaps complete joke depletion on behalf of the writers as the movie goes along. I look forward to another movie where they hopefully explore deeper plot development to compliment the fantastic job of portraying this unique character's idiosyncrasies.

when deadpool gets skewered after exploding the lab, Francis even curves the metal rod behind his back, I'm assuming to make it harder for him to get away. How does he get away? If he just pushes it through his body, wouldn't some evidence of that shown once he came up through the ashes of the building? 

Also, did they reference the glass tube being indestructible/made out of super strong glass/material? The one that Vanessa was in during the final fight/fall? Why else would it, and her, have been unharmed? 

Is this movie at all tying in with the Marvel Cinematic Universe? I thought I caught a glimpse of one of the super slaves looking like CrossBones but it was really fast and I'm not sure if that would make any sense.

When the movie opened up on that scene, I thought, ""Oh, we're getting that out of the way."" Except we kept coming back to it, every other scene. It felt like some scenes dragged on forever because we'd seen so much of it - same could be said with some of the jokes; I definitely noticed that, in a full theater, only a few people chuckled at the jokes that had been shown repeatedly in trailers. And that was a considerable amount of the film. Still, coming in just wanting to laugh, I had a good time - when the jokes were funny, they were funny. 

edit: also want to add: I want to know what happens next in the taxi driver's story. I know this initial impression seemed like I had more cons than pros, but it IS a fun film - the pacing was noticeable though. I'll probably see it again to catch more jokes that I missed.

czwv072,"I will be honest here. I only thought the movie was okay.


I only have two main complaints. Everyone but Deadpool is boring. 

Coloussus is just CGI plus an entertaining voice, but he feels underused in the fights. Deadpool fights Ajax and Angel Dust? Well, for all intents and purposes, they are normal looking people. Ajax is strong and can’t feel pain? Okay. Angel Dust is super Colossus strong? Okay. I still feel the entire film he is just fighting easy to kill gangsters and these two normal looking people. The villains don’t pop out and never in any way feel hardcore.


And second, the intro I didn’t like. The car chase/accident was nice. But after he did the killing, it kept getting broken up by the backstory. The backstory felt incredibly long. The torture scenes were long. It just had me nodding my head, yeah yeah, get back to being Deadpool!


Just overall it didn’t feel like the movie had enough happening in it. It is the type of problem a sequel can easily fix.

That being said, the villain was weak, almost comically so. For most of the movie I half expected him to be some kind of middleman between Deadpool and the ""actual"" big bad guy. I think it definitely hurt the movie, or at least hurt it's rewatchability somewhat. Second, the locations were also fairly bland, switching constantly between one industrial area to another.

That being said the humour alone makes it well worth the watch.

I only came here to see if there was anyone else wondering with me. Me and my girlfriend were both excited to see this and deadpool wasn't new to either of us, but this didn't feel like a smartass, sarcastic dark-humor deadpool, this felt like ""what's the most fucked up potty humor we can make here"" and then they shoved the ""naughty super hero"" premise down your throat the entire film. CONSTANT commentary after every. Single. Action, like he shoots at a bad guy and misses: ""bad deadpool"" then he hits a bad guy ""GOOD deadpool"" the only people I know who make jokes like that are 11. Nobody in my (small 30 person) theater laughed either so I didn't think it was just me after a while. The really funny lines in the movie Were not the ""cue-the-joke"" lines or the ""This cock-gobbling ball-chewer"" lines, they were things like the X-men house blowing up every 2 years or which Professor Xavier, my favorite was ""I would go with you, but I don't want to"" everything else in the movie was mostly desperate humor. To me The concept of a super-hero that doesn't give a shit wasn't polished and matured, it was like a first take at the script and then they tried to force the premise of a ""naughty"" super hero down your throat. Even just the way his voice went up and down when he did the narration gave me a clowny awkward second-hand-embarrassment feel to it. I was mega let down. In fact I got more deadpool from Guardians of the galaxy where the humor wasn't REALLY trying to be whacky, zany, dick-punching stuff but there were still comments like Chris Prats ship looking like a Jackson Paloc painting under a black light and a hero who was a hero by accident.

czzynjh,"I thought it was a solid 3/5. It hit the right beats comedy-wise, but there's no real reason to rewatch it - it's a good time killer like 21 Jump Street, This is the End etc, in that you watch it once, laugh at the jokes, enjoy the simple story. Then next time you see it, it's a background movie while you're doing something with mates. In a couple years when you watch it on Netflix most of the gags related to current events will feel dated.

Colossus was sterotype canon Colossus with no extra/interesting wrinkles to his character which felt like a lost opportunity. Francis, Angel Dust and Negasonic were just plot points - Francis was never really the foreboding menace they seemed to want him to be, just always felt like someone else's henchman. None of the other mutants were fleshed out, suffering the same one-dimensional plot-point-only problem which Marvel's other movies are regularly criticised for. The jokes were good, RR did great, CGI was good, action was good. Police did not exist in this universe, even just as flashing lights in the distance when giant things crashed to the ground, which broke immersion a little. Not much to criticise - it is a decent movie and does Deadpool justice.",45cn7c

Movie was awesome, Deadpool is an absolute badass. 

Would be an easy 10/10 for me, but I just thought the jokes got old at the end. I laughed in the beginning but towards the end, you could kinda guess when he would make a joke

d06pjo4,"Quite a fun showing. The theater laughed at most of the jokes and the action was very intense and fun. I kind of wished the visual gags were even more stark though. The film goes from being very visual with the gags one time and covering them up or panning the camera away at other times. Other than that, it seems the movie has won over the audience by going where jokes and visuals usually never go for in a comic book film for a major mainstream comic continuity. In both sexual and violence imagery, it went to places where even many comedic and drama shows don't  go. And I  love how it was all shot and framed, that made it all work. And the audience really was surprised by it.

A bit of a shame that the main villains likely won't  be back again (except for one), but I  hope Deadpool and Cable can really go after some big names in comics now. Obviously, the organization in this film are in the business of making mutants, so I  hope there is an even bigger crossover with other mutants and maybe Deadpool can even cameo in a future Xmen film or they can even have a more comprehensive crossover someday.

I wonder if the broader Marvel studio might be willing to let him make an appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well. The future is really bright for Deadpool as a character. This is something I  swore would never happen after how Deadpool was treated in that Wolverine movie. But now, it seems like anything could happen for Deadpool. I am very happy for the director Tim Miller and Ryan Reynolds too. I hope both of their futures are secured thanks to this film.",45cn7c

I freaking loved it. Honestly, I thought the cringe-iest lines (and the ones the theater laughed the least at) were the ones from the trailer. Almost every other line in the movie was worth at least a chuckle, and seeing it in a packed theater amplified the whole experience. I haven't seen a theater laugh that hard (or consistently) since the glass box scene in 22 Jump Street. Fantastic film, and I consider myself adequately humbled for ever doubting it.

I did find that Deadpool's world was somewhat weirdly unpopulated: there were no civilians or police anywhere after that car chase (nor during it really), the X-Men mansion seemed abandoned, the final fight was at a totally abandoned junkyard, and when the lab place was burning down there seemed to be nobody else working there. It was like there was no-one in the world that wasn't directly connected to Deadpool or the bad guys. I found that kind of strange, especially in a superhero film.",45cn7c

czyiwqw,"Really liked the movie - funny, but not over the top; cool action; decent story.  Not much else to say since the good stuff has been covered already.  Had a decent lively audience who made the experience better (although one guy kinda overdid it).  

Major gripes with the movie is that I didn't understand the main baddies powers - I understand he can't feel pain (I'll accept that its not a debilitating power) but I don't understand how he fought so well and was so powerful.  

Also, I usually like origin stories, but Deadpool's went on too long (movie wasn't badly paced, just that too much time was spent on Deadpool origins) and I wished the movie would have focused on the growing craziness of his character and how he developed his fighting abilities.  The movie does explain that he's a mercenary with like 41 confirmed kills, but when we see him in deadpool mode he's doing ninja stuff so I don't understand how he knows that, especially since he didn't get his mutant powers until the doctor subjected him to the experiments.  Also, Deadpool was a bit goofy before his transformation, but I would have liked more dialogue about him just loosing it.  

Gripes aren't that big though.  I really enjoyed the movie, and will definitely be picking it up when it comes out. ",45cn7c

d02wjqu,"Ok so I've got an awesome proposal for you and it is this... What if Deadpool IS actually meant to be set in the MCU and not the FOX Universe. Basically this whole movie is a secret fuck you to the license issue altogether... This is the reason why he references McAvoy and Patrick like he does and there's also memorabilia with toys from the failed wolverine movie as well and other crack to the FOX versions of the X-Men. You see in this Universe these movies were actually just that, MOVIES and they were somehow maybe based upon the real MCU version of the X-Men, which is why we don't get to see any of the other X-men yet as well and even though jokingly he says they couldn't afford more X men in the film he, still could have been referencing any number of the X-men films as well, as they cut their roster and cheezed up some of the characters significantly, due to budgetary reasons. 
So this being said that is also why we see a fucked up helicarrier being disassembled, maybe due to the events of what happened in Capt. Merica's winter soldier. Also the syndicate responsible for giving him his powers seem awfully Hyra-esqe, if you ask me. There's a little more I could throw at this theory but I'm sure you get the point. 
So basically DEADPOOL is actually an unofficial MARVEL Movie and they are secretly setting it up to where they can bring these two franchises back together. Whattya y'all think?",45cn7c

d01m6ti,"Not my favorite to be honest. I'm not a super hero comic book movie person much myself... I enjoy some but I find them cheesy as fuck usually.

I loved the story/relationships in the movie, they felt so real and not super forced and awkward like most superhero movies with lots of staring at each other and the chick being rescued at the end. I enjoyed that Deadpool acknowledged he is not really a hero and never changed from that.

I did not laugh once during the movie. The humor reminds me of the humor I used in my aim chats back in middle school. Barely any of the jokes landed with me because I just felt they were so predictable. It wasn't like I was rolling my eyes and hated it, I found it humorous but not enough to laugh out loud. As someone posted a few days ago... the humor is very ""LoL so random!!!1 XD"" The humor for me is also something that once I've seen or heard the joke once, I don't really need to see again. The thing I hate about most superhero movies are the one liners... this movie was ALL one liners.

I did like the very simplistic story, which I guess others didnt. I also liked that it was more light hearted than most others. It was more fun and (obviously) didn't take itself seriously.

I know there's only 2-3 action sequences, and revealing a majority of the parts from it really took away from it in the cinema. 

I usually hate crass humor that's forced, but honestly, it all felt natural in this setting. Deadpool IS that snarky, explicit, douche-hero and I felt all the humor worked. The meta humor, sex jokes, even the violence was comedic. A lot of Deadpool's banter during the fights cracked me up too. I'm gonna give it an 8/10. I think movies like The Raid/2 has changed my thirst for violence in films. I wanted to see Deadpool fuck more people up brutally. There obviously were some great kills. Guess the movie accomplished my purchased ticket for the sequel. Ryan Reynolds was born for this role. 

And might I add the fact that he's still doing the character after the movie released is perfect. His spoof of Kanye's SNL meltdown was hysterical. I hope he becomes an embedded pop culture icon.",45cn7c

THE GOOD:

The humour. As long as you don't mind crudeness it's outrageously fun. The meta stuff is fantastic too.

Reynolds and T.J. Miller are superb. Also whoever voiced Colossus killed it.

Action sequences are very well directed.

Post-credits scene is awesome

THE BAD:

Too many flashbacks

It's surprisingly formulaic. Central plot isn't memorable at all.

Villains are boring.

Romance is dull.

THE WEIRD:

It's so full of up to the minute references I wonder if it will actually age well at all

It's enjoyable but flawed. Refreshing but at the same time a little frustrating as it had the potential to be a classic.",45cn7c

As a huge Deadpool fan, I think this movie was everything it needed to be. It was Deadpool brought to life, no compromises, worts and all. Deadpool is a polarizing character. If you like Deadpool, you'll love this movie.

There were times when I could feel the movie's tight budget, but even that issue was handled masterfully. What's great about the Deadpool character is that any faults this movie may have can be explained away or excused  because it is a Deadpool Movie. If a particular joke doesn't land, you can say, ""well sometimes Deadpool makes shitty jokes"". If it was expertly polished and prestine and if it took itself too seriously or tried to meet really high cinematic expectations, it wouldn't be Deadpool. The imperfections actually help make the movie feel more authentic. Name another character that could get away with that? I bet Sony wished they could have had that kind of freedom from expectations with Spiderman. 

I'm confident this movie has earned Deadpool many sequels and cameos for the Merc in the X-Men Universe and I can't wait. As a character, Deadpool works best when he plays off of other big characters. That'll be fun to watch. 

Also, I know Fox has been wondering who could take the torch from Hugh Jackman and be the hot selling point for X-Men after he leaves the character. I think they are going to now have to look at Ryan Renolds and Deadpool. I know it sounds crazy, but Deadpool is going to be a monster success for them, especially considering its Rated R. And if you understand Deadpool's tenious relationship with the X-Men in the comics, you can appreciate how ironic and hilarious the prospect of that can be.",45cn7c

czzujxt,"Seems like someone finally got the x men right from the comics. Looking forward to any more additions. Some sweet Python nods 

Was pretty solid and well balanced as you want it to be. Not ott with Deathpool in jokes or wackiness. Ryan bringing out a comedic role I don't think he's done since playing Berg. Defiantly left lot more from universe for future films. Funny as fuck. 

Also guy next to me got really excited about new cloverfield first time he's heard of it or saw the trailer ",45cn7c
czyzgp4,"I have a very unpopular opinion to share - I enjoyed Ant-Man more than Deadpool

I am probably very much in the minority but I found Deadpool really try-hard in a lot of its moments. My theatre was laughing a lot but I found most of the humour very predictable. Like when Colossus was lecturing Deadpool about heroes and he still shot Francis.
I liked the Fourth Wall stuff as well as the extreme violence, but I felt the swearing was often gratuitous without purpose. Wade didn't have to say fuck every other word. In fact it would have had more of an impact if he didn't

Now I'm sure this is a case of high expectations but I went into Ant-Man with zero and ended up enjoying it and laughing a lot. I thought I would enjoy Deadpool in a very similar way but it just didn't happen. Plus the middle bit of Deadpool with the origin story dragged on a bit

Feel free to tell me I'm a dicktit",45cn7c
czyrvqv,"I don't know much about Deadpool but I like him as a character. I do know a fair amount about (comics and animation) X-Men though as well as the story behind this movie getting made, so that helped.

I was hyped for the movie and I was not let down. I HAD FUN. That's what this movie is. It is fun.

Is it ""the best action movie ever""? No. The best comic book hero movie? No. 

It's fun, that's all it is. I got most of the jokes, I laughed a lot and loved the movie. But I can tell it's not one that has much replay value (at least for me) and it's not life-changing.

I'm willing to bet that if this movie were greenlit the first time and we all didn't have that ""root for the underdog"" mentality going on, it wouldn't be performing as well as it is currently.

The movie's fun. If you like comics, you'll have fun. If you were a bit of a nerd in the 90s, you'll catch many of the jokes. If you liked the trailers, you'll love the movie. 

If you're on the fence about whether you'll like this movie or not based on the trailer, then wait until it comes out on VOD or something. It's not a 10/10 movie. It's just fun to be a part of several inside jokes.

edit: Damn, didn't realize an opinion other than ""Best movie ever"" would be so controversial.",45cn7c
d00h9k8,"I found myself adoring the first half of the film and being bored for the 2nd half. Part 1 was fresh and new and quirky. The romance was different, the 4th wall shit was tight, and RR shows a ton of heart. Solid! 

but Part 2 felt like any other action movie.",45cn7c
czxg111,"Loved the movie, but obligatory nitpicks:

1) Beyond crass jokes and hyper-violence it felt like they played it just a touch to safe.  None of the jokes where really the type to offend sensibilities beyond throwing in some heavy swearing.

2) A lot of times Deadpool does something irreverent to have a pay-off in the end.  Opening scene when he puts the haunted segway tour brochure in his pocket I so badly wanted him to show up to the final battle via haunted segway tour. 

EDIT 1: After reading some of the replies regarding the number one tiny nitpick I will say you guys make good points, but like I said I think they played it just a TOUCH too safe, there certainly were some pretty shocking moments, namely the pegging.  There wasn't much if any satire though, which is something I was expecting, however the movie doesn't really suffer because of it; just pointing out a couple things I was expecting/hoping for that didn't really happen.",45cn7c
czxwv78,"Casual Deadpool fan, and by casual I mean what I've seen from him in animation and the video game. And I had an absolute blast, maybe also because the theater was packed and everyone was laughing like maniacs. Most people were young I mean 16 years old to maybe 35 max. There were actual couples, even ladies that came in groups, which is telling: an A+ marketing campaign usually gets asses on seats. 

Not every joke landed because I lacked the context behind some, but when they did I was almost in tears, the action was nicely done, a mix between over abundance of slow-mos, close ups and CG. Supporting roles actually had something to bring to the table, and made you care about them. The romance part was nicely done, honestly despite how twisted and crazy it was, it was touching nonetheless. I'm spreading the gospel and I'm signing up for sequels. It's not a perfect movie, the villain although very handsome was forgettable, the last act was comic book fight 101 which is ironical since this is the movie casting the stone. But it was still a solid and entertaining movie.",45cn7c

I really had an issue with the pacing, not that I was expecting a ""Best Picture"" film by any means, but the flashbacks were placed very poorly in my opinion. The villain was so throwaway that every time he was on screen I was waiting for DP to make a joke or a fight to happen, he wasn't very memorable. 

I did LOVE the action in this though, all the kills were visceral and looked great! The romance was actually pretty compelling too, I really felt for Wade when he was too insecure to approach his girl. Maybe I would've loved most of the jokes too, except it felt like all of the great ones were spoiled in the red band trailer.

czzwtbu,"Can someone tell me if I got a censored version? 

There were 2 parts that seemed cut to me.  The part where Jed Rees(the recruiter) dies was the first.  Deadpool pans the camera away, and while I expected it to pan back to him getting eviscerated, it didn't.

The second part was when Gina Carano(Angel Dust)'s tit pops out, and Colossus covers it up.  

Those very well may have been part of the movie, and they might be saving it for the director's cut, but I'm concerned some other stuff may have been left out. 

Also, I live in Iowa, so I wouldn't imagine it would be censored.  But, the movie just didn't feel all that bad for an R Rating. 

Obviously I won't let my daughter see it until she's older.  And I may just be desensitized to violence, but it just seemed like another gorefest to me, and not something that would be close to NC-17.

Don't get me wrong.  I fucking loved the movie.  I rate it 69/10.  Best action movie and superhero movie I'd ever seen.  I also didn't expect to get feels during the love story.

d0g2dj9,"I liked the movie a lot, but I think it suffers from the ""marvel syndrome"", which is to put a lot of effort into a certain aspect of the movie and sort of coast for the rest. Sort of like how movies like Thor put a lot of effort into building the marvel universe while putting no effort into plot structure, character depth, and other stuff, Deadpool put a ton of effort into the writing and comedy aspect, which led to a few flaws.

I think the plot was pretty bland. I never really like origin stories unless they're really original, but this just felt like a less overdramatic version of Wolverine's origin. I understand the point of the movie was to present Deadpool's origin story, but they could've definitely cut 30 minutes off it. The villain was pretty bland as well, we don't know anything about who he is, and his entire personality revolves around him being a huge a-hole. 

On the flipside, the writing and Ryan Reynolds's acting were fantastic. The humor was on point for almost all the movie, high points for me were deadpool trying to fight colossus, and his line about telling beast to stop shitting on his lawn. Deadpool's interaction with the X-men was by far the best part of the movie, everything felt really organic and they all had some great lines between each other. I think if they focused more on Deadpool's ""being a dick to super heroes"" aspect and less on his origin story, it would've been a great movie",45cn7c

So whats the deal with Deadpool and wolverine? Is he just trolling wolverine? 

In the movie he already knows the Xmen..did he know about them before he became Deadpool? Did he have an obsession with Wolverine before he got superpowers and became deadpool?  

Did he have many side adventures between the time he became deadpool and the time he had his final boss fight with the guy who tortured him? Or is that how the xmen know him just by trying to stop him getting vengance on that one guy.",45cn7c

The best Deadpool arcs are the ones which bring out the inner tormented, lonely version of Deadpool in contrast with his humorous behavior. Also when he denies being a good guy but struggles with high stakes moral decisions. I'd also love to see the version of Deadpool where his healing power becomes increasingly powerful but at the cost of his sanity.  Since Deadpool is quite literally insane for a lot of the comics. Unfortunately none of this is possible right now because Deadpool is simply too happy. His life is actually pretty nice. Chances are fox will keep Deadpool around add comic relief but there is a lot of potential for a truly deep character.",45cn7c

I am approaching my mid 20's and it is sad to see so many people take life so serious that they don't even ""smell the roses"" anymore. People just don't laugh anymore and make memories. While Deadpool took itself as a movie serious when it needed to be, the laughs and breaking the wall really made me realize that more of these movies need to start being made not just because they are good cinema, but because people need to wake up and take life a little less serious.

 I don't think IMAX was worth it except for the poster. The opening credit titles seemed off and I don't know if it was just because of the IMAX rendering or if it's normally like that. I think the pacing was weird but considering it's under 2 hours that's to be expected.

czy8vmh,"Just saw it, enjoyed it. I think that it's a good movie, it certainly could have been way worse based off of some prior examples- but, it was cool.

I don't want to be that guy.
But I will.
Went by really quickly- I think the flashbacks played a big part in that. The ""origin"", while I'm glad they kept it in, was innaccurate- his healing power comes from a jacked up version taken from wolverine, plus the ""deadpool"" game was player inside the treatment facility, not the bar. Loved that they kept the merc bar and Al, those were pretty nice. 

I think that the biggest things that threw me off were the amount if violence, the girl, and Deadpool's overall attitude. 

Any of his comics has him wading through at least 5 or six separate encounters with baddies, in addition to any plot points- the movie had three fights. 

In most of the comics, Deadpool is a dude who's either chasing tail, caught tail, or is sobbing from his deep inadequacies- there are some storyline where he thinks he finds love, but it usually ends horribly. I think the classic guy saves girl thing didn't really work, because that's not what happens in the comics, unless she brutally dies in the next movie.

His humor is a shield, something he uses to compensate for the immense feeling of pain that he WADES through daily. Some statements about avacodo coitus and a ""ohhh I'm ugly"" scene don't do it justice. People die all around him. He has lived through much more horrible and traumatic experiences. Insecurity, inadequacy, and overall tragedy and failure are a HUGE factor in his character. He is borderline immortal, and thus separate from almost all of humanity. It's a heavy topic, and while touched on, I don't think the movie did it justice.

Lastly, his healing factor. In the cable and deadpool comics, cable will outright shoot deadpool in the head to get him to shut up, and he'll be talking two panels later. I don't know the precise time that sort of thing takes, but he wins a fight with wolverine due to his healing factor being faster- and, though I haven't seen them in a while, I think the x-man movies had a much faster heal time than this one. 

So I mean.. yeah. Rewatchability is a big thing too, and I'm not so sure the same references will be funny the 8th time. 

Anyways, ecstatic an actual deadpool movie got made, it was better than most, but I probably wouldn't buy it.",45cn7c
d00fjdn,"Its like watching a blind and deaf comedian doing stand up. Deadpool just makes the same jokes that don't work. Take the scene where Deadpool says, ""Shit, did I leave the stove on?"" while he was in the car crash. Its like the movie was written by nine year olds. And that wasn't the only joke that fell so flat that I cringed either. The action wasn't that good either. It was too shaky tell what was going on, when there was action. For action movie it didn't have very much action scenes. It had the car chase and the ending for action. The story had lots of holes and missed opportunities.

This R-rated adaptation of the beloved anti-hero was everything I dreamed of being a fan of the source material. Ryan Reynolds portrayed the character perfectly and his enthusiasm could be felt by the audience. In terms of story, Deadpool was a generic super hero origin story, but the high jinks of the character made the movie feel fresh in comparison to other super hero movies of today. The movie was hilarious, raunchy, and pure fun! I would highly recommend...Also make sure to stay around for the post credit scene!",45cn7c

czyqn3w,"Deadpool failed to call out the lazy, terrible stereotype that was Vanessa. Introduced as a prostitute, she is given literally nothing to do. She is sex object and damsel in distress. The film wanted so badly to be different but that was so lazy and bland. Disappointing.

It does try too hard. Some of the meta jokes are too obvious to be really funny, like the Stewart/McAvoy. I liked Deadpool actually talking to camera more than when his dialogue to other characters explicitly referenced the film/studio.

It is well cast. Ryan Reynolds really does nail his performance, and  TJ Miller is very entertaining. Baccarin has little do to but is good too.

It did, however, have a superb post credits scene. Couldn't have been much better, in all honesty.

For me it's an 8/10, lacking a bit because the story wasn't particularly interesting. But the comedy and action was top notch.

This isn't exactly a criticism, more of an observation, but I think it's the sort of move that won't age well. In just a few years it'll look very dated. So many pop culture references, slang, and metahumour that'll not hold up years down the line.

czx3cq1,"Went to HK to see it (I'm from mainland). Total worth my money. Kind of relieved that I didn't have to see the censored version in China, meanwhile considering the quality of the film it could do a great job on the box office (both Ant-man and Kingsman proved that you don't have to be a big/ family-friendly blockbuster to make big money in China), which will benefit the film a lot and the studio might be able to afford three X-men in the sequel. 

Watched it in 4DX the first time, the constant kicking in my back was a bit distracting but made me appreciate the action scenes better. Also I love how the songs were used, reminded me a bit of Guardians of the Galaxy. Was surprised to find out the soundtrack was composed by Junkie XL. Would definitely buy the bluray and ost.

One thing that went over my head is how could Deadpool expect someone as evil as Ajax would agree to cure him? 

Personally I think it's by far the most unique film in MCU (how the story was told and how it's actually IS a love story) . If the tickets aren't so expensive in HK I'd be happy to watch it three or four times in a week. ",45cn7c

I've never like Ryan Reynolds.  He doesn't really have much depth as an actor, he's always just grated with me.  Despite this, he was a great choice as Deadpool, as Deadpool is kinda annoying as a character.

We're thrust straight into Deadpool's world, as the opening credits are all from his point of view.  The way the story (and opening action scene) is introduced and plays out is a really nice piece of cinematic story telling. 

I knew there would be a lot of breaking the fourth wall and Deadpool being dangerously genre aware, so I didn't find the jokes done in that vein as jolting as they could have been if I weren't expecting it.  I do think that they don't really take you out of the action regardless of whether you are expecting them or not.  

When they work, the work really well (stick around for the end credits scene, the question of which 'Professor X' they were going to see), when the don't, they're very cheesy (OOOH! Green Lantern was a terrible film, and guess who played the hero?).  I would have liked to have seen less of the genera savvy jokes, and more of the Deadpool mouthy humour jokes.  Oh, and Ryan Reynolds.  Don't try to do an Australian accent again, ok?

Along with the jokes come the action.  My goodness golly gosh the CG looks like arse.  It was woefully bad.  Bad enough to take you out of the story, which was annoying as they were well choreographed and directed.

The fight scenes are great, however.  Angel and Colossus' final battle is one of the best fight scenes I've seen in an US action film ever.  Having a former MMA fighter show her moves was pants-wettingly good.  Having the female villain being the 'big bad' was also a great piece of writing.

Fox  pulled some shenanigans on the budget (as referenced by Deadpool in the film), which - I think - meant the action scenes were less 'splody shooty and more hitty swordy.  This, in my opinion, made for better action.

This film has a near-naked Morena Baccarin, which would be worth the price of admission alone.  The love scenes between Vanessa and Wade are damn sexy.  I'm pretty sure the naked bum shot of Reynolds was just put in as a 'look, we aren't sexist'  by Fox.

Deadpool's origin is fairly elastic in the comics, and having this particular setting works well for the film.  It also allows a simple introduction of the main villains of Ajax and Angel Dust.

Using the fairly obscure X-Men characters of both Angel Dust and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (don't worry, I had to google them as well) was a choice I'm a little confused with.  It's nice to be able to say 'here are these characters introduced in the Deadpool narrative', and sets it apart from Fox's other X-Men films, and all but the most strident fans wouldn't know that Negasonic's powers are nothing like in the comics, but having more 'well known' characters would have brought some more bankability to the film.

All in all a very enjoyable film.  I'm actually looking forward to the next one, and I hope that Cable is in it.

I realize that a review this glowing raises eyebrows and invokes fears of blind fandom, but its really that good.

There is a lot of creative energy about the film, a lot of freedom about the story, the humor and the acting. It feels *fresh* and unhinged, and where some movies need restraint to be good, this movie understands its own chaotic balance. It's easy, but also unconventional. Inspired, but not overly weird. Hilarious, but not tiring or annoying and the humor never takes away from the action. It even has its serious moments, and I'm not afraid to admit that my tears were jerked a little at the end. Everything works astonishingly well.

czx1p3h,"I have a specific question about seeing this movie that I hope someone would be able to answer accurately.  First, some context:

I'm not much of a superhero movies guy.  I never read superhero comics growing up.  I didn't grow up caring about batman or superman or any of that.  And I haven't seen very many of the superhero movies that have been coming out for the past 10 years or whatever.  I've seen the Christopher Nolan batmans, the Spidermans with Tobey Maguire, like 1 Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, and I think that's it.  I liked the batmans and the spidermans (first 2), mostly because I think those were actually good movies on their own, not just superhero movies.  The others were meh, didn't feel like they were that great of movies, so they couldn't win me over to care about the characters.  They didn't have much for me as someone who didn't come into the movie as a fan of the characters, is what I'm saying.

So, here I am, someone who doesn't really know deadpool.  Can I still enjoy this movie?  I like meta, witty, silly, humor--any kind of humor, really.  So I would imagine the type of humor in the movie would work for me.  But are they all ""inside"" jokes?--as in, do I need to know deadpool or the other superhero movies in order to understand and appreciate the jokes?  Can I enjoy the movie like I did the spiderman and batman movies?--or do I need to be fluent in deadpool comics in order to have fun with this?

I ask because my brother is a big fan of deadpool and wants me to see this.  And to be honest, despite the fact that I generally don't like superheros, this deadpool character seems like fun to me.  I've seen a bit of him when my brother plays marvel vs capcom 3 and he seems fun.  I want to be able to go and enjoy this movie.  Do you guys think it will be possible for me to do this?",45cn7c

This movie is an extremely basic, by-the-numbers origin story that has swearing and 4th-wall-breaking. That's it. That's everything you get here. Guys, breaking the fourth wall is not funny in and of itself. It is not funny to just namecheck actors and mention that you're in a movie.   
  
Mentioning it's fictional is the easiest thing you could do. Try writing clever wordplay, or characters so realistic everyone will recognize them from their own life, or situations where every new complication makes the audience gasp at its inevitable repercussions. These things are hard, and worth praise when pulled off.

The jokes are so immature and dull that they become a repetitive cringe fest after around half an hour. Regarding the action scenes: pretty meh by Marvel standard. The only thing that's different than other CGI films nowadays are lame one liners. They're okay.

I was looking forward to the wit and commentary of it, and what wit was there was fantastic. Hands down the best part of that movie though was Colossus.

- flows to get the person/people responsible for his disfigurement 
- very well trained with weapons

Cut to the end of the movie, his girlfriend is in there, but the sword doesn't puncture it so the whole time he is fighting on the clock to save her. He wins the fight in the knick of time, she is still alive, but barely. Bad guy isn't actually dead. Hits her in the back of the head with the ax. She appears to be dead. Deadpool and him go at it again, and he almost loses, when last minute an ax goes through francis' head - reveal, she was in the tube long enough to transform - now she is LADY DEADPOOL!!!! Boom.

My point isn't to even imply there's anything wrong with those people but you're going to roll your eyes throughout this entire movie if you don't consider yourself part of that group.

The movie is basically a very tired template with internet-y type jokes and this embarrassing sense of self-awareness. This is basically a movie entirely for man-children. The studios are doing a good job dialing in their movies for that demographic. Wouldn't be surprised if this movie does well internationally as well and just makes a ton of money. ",45cn7c

czxrrvd,"I wish there was more of that universally funny slapstick stupid kind of humour. I mean things like name dropping Rosie O'Donnell and extended jokes about Taken or IKEA just aren't remotely funny. The scene where he's hitting Colossus was by far the funniest scene. There should have been more crazy stuff like that like when they were getting all the guns in the house he should have pulled a rocket launcher out of the toilet or something. The action scenes also weren't funny, it kinda reminded me of that Jackie Chan every frame a painting episode. They were OK. Also the best 4th wall breaks were the studio couldn't afford another X-man and he looks like he'll advance the plot. Some of the 4th wall breaks were just breaking the 4th wall for the sake of it with no joke. He broke the 4th wall constantly but no where near the level of spaceballs or blazing saddles. Was hoping for him to interact with the film crew or something.



Also, the biggest, most unforgivable problem with the film: there wasn't a single reference to the Clint Eastwood movie ""Deadpool""",45cn7c

He opens the chamber, makes the remark, tells Wade he's going to shut him back in there, and does so. Wade does not leave the chamber between being put in it unmutated and blowing it up with the match he steals from Angel Dust (with his mouth, you recall, because he was tied down the whole time). At what point would he have been X-Rayed?

I don't think this is some awful error, it doesn't ruin immersion and it serves the purpose of informing people in the audience who don't know Deadpool that this is where he got his healing factor, but it is a sort of plothole nonetheless.

I didn't mind the gameplay myself, but I'm not a hardcore gamer, so I'm probably not as sensitize to such things.  I thought the game was so funny and entertaining that I watched a complete Let's Play of the whole game, and then I got the game and played it all the way through myself.  Absolutely hilarious.

And here's a tip for you if you do end up playing it.  Any time there's an ""idle animation"" (Deadpool doing something when you're not pressing any keys), LET IT ROLL.  Don't interrupt it or move on with the game until it starts repeating.  Some of them run for about five minutes of new material, and it's all funny.  Also, when it gives you the option to press a button repeatedly or just go on with the game, keep pressing the button.  The one where he's slapping Wolverine was particularly hilarious.

czy0n36,"Yup, when they first showed hints of it in the trailers, some people were saying that ""no way, it can't be a helicarrier"" mainly because Fox wouldn't have the rights to use it. Marvel studios controls SHIELD use after all. My prediction was that they wouldn't even mention it, it would just *be*, sitting there as a setpiece. :) Plus it was the old style comic book helicarrier with the thruster pods rather than the MCU fan-wings.",45cn7c
czy7qko,Indeed it was and that was Hydra Bob that Deadpool recognizes just before the final fight. Hydra Bob is a low level Hydra henchman that isn't very good at his job.

It would make sense though, Deadpool didn't come off quite as insane as I expected. In fact pre-Deadpool Wade wasn't much different. Sometimes seemed like just Wade vs Ugly Wade with powers.

The reality is that DoFP was a polite (but far from perfect) way to pretend that X3 and Wolverine never happened, so they don't have to deal with the bed-shitting and could fix the franchise. 

By all accounts if it were trying to be ""canonical"" then Deadpool would be a period film set in the 80's, which is more of a headache than it's worth. No one should blame them at all for just doing their own thing and vaguely pretending it all somehow fits into the post-DoFP timeline.",45cn7c

It's not that genius... it has plot holes the size of the stadium Magneto dropped on top of the White House

I'm expected to believe that assassinating one arms dealer is enough to convince the US Government that mutants were enough of a threat to greenlight the Sentinel program, but not a mutant being able to infiltrate the President's inner circle, impersonate the president, and then try to assassinate him while another mutant picks up a fucking football stadium and drops it on the White House, all after yet more mutants broke into the Pentagon and broke out their prisoner, the one who later dropped a football stadium on the white house...... convinced the government that mutants were not a significant threat to their existance and that they shouldn't hunt them all down ASAP.

d0305kf,"I'm really impressed that they worked the love story in in such a way that it didn't drag or feel tacked on the way so many action romances are. It was a cancer movie, a love story, a medical horror show and a superhero flick all rolled into one. That's a lot of moving parts with so much room for error, but the script blended them all together without any whiplash or feeling one part of the cocktail didn't belong.",45cn7c

I didn't get to appreciate any of the references or shit because I never got in to the marvel universe. And the sex jokes...I felt like I was watching the musings of a 16 year old who was trying too hard to be raunchy and relatable. 

I guess it would be better if I knew who Deadpool was, or appreciated the references to other characters. But from an outside perspective it tried too hard to be funny with jokes that were not clever at all, and way, *way* too frequent. ",45cn7c

To me, it was hysterical. My wife loves it too and she knows very little about the comics (only what I have tried to explain). I say give it a shot but don't expect a normal superhero flick.

I'm not saying the action or comedy are exactly like Tarantino or Macfarlane, but they're in the same area in terms of extremeness.

One thing I can say - it's the first time in a long time that I've actually laughed so hard, so much and so loud at a comedy that was actually primarily written to be a comedy (as opposed to other superhero movies with comedic elements - where GotG fits on that spectrum I do not know, but comedy in many of them seems to play second fiddle to the action, which is fair enough).",45cn7c

When angel dust is sewing him up after wade stabbed him on the highway he said that he wished he had wades healing. So no he doesn't heal, but he doesn't feel any pain so I suppose even if he was critically injured he would still fight like nothing was wrong. That's what I gathered",45cn7c

d024exd,"That was pretty ambiguous, but we get some hints. We know he was a special forces soldier, then worked as a mercenary. So we can guess that he has a pretty high level of combat training. Also, we get a preview of his ability when he and Vanessa meet and they play skeeball. He casually lobs a ball into the 50,000 points hole or whatever it was, which indicates pretty exceptional hand-eye coordination. Also, we would expect him to be exceptionally strong post-mutation since strength training, in simple terms is breaking down muscles by working them at high capacity, then rebuilding/healing them in a rest period. 

But that's just, like, my opinion.",45cn7c
d01jel6,"In the comics, Wade was an extremely skilled mercenary even before getting his cancer (and regeneration) but since this isn't comics, the only info we have on Wade is that from X-Men Origins: Wolverine.

  Other than that, the info you're looking for is all in the comics, and not in the movie sadly. Deadpool was already super-agile, pretty damn strong, pain still registers like it does to Wolverine.  
As for Francis, his powers are also not explained in the movie much other than him not feeling pain or anything.  
In the comics, Francis also doesn't feel pain, but also has super strength, speed, durability, and mental capabilities. (You know, the basic villian powers.) So I would assume that, no, I don't think Francis is coming back.",45cn7c

So this film really reflects that madness well. It's tough for non comic fans to enjoy some of these movies, because if you don't know what's going on, it can be harder to appreciate. So I understand you're confusion, but they nailed it as far as this character is concerned. ",45cn7c

FOX doesn't have the rights any of the MCU's content and Marvel and FOX are not nearly on good enough terms to allow such an exchange of properties (if they were, you can bet it'd be on Variety and the Hollywood Reporter like the Marvel/Sony accord) so you're not going to see their stuff in the X-Men movies any time soon.

You learn to hate Ajax, as he is a douche that causes quite a lot of personal pain to Deadpool. Angel Dust is a glorified henchwoman, but her battle with Colosus was pretty entertaining, and actually serves to give Colossus some character development (breasts) which made him more endearing.

Colossus gets a pass for finally getting the character right. Finally he is in his metal state and actually doing something, showing his pacifistic character traits and honorable personality. He made the movie so much more 'real', which is ironic since be was mostly CG. I loved him and I'm fine if the pretty-boy X-men version never comes back. This was Colossus!

The story, while bipolar and a little sluggish, was important to establish the character. The flashbacks were my least favorite parts but if a little slow character development is my biggest complain on this movie, then it still stands miles above most of the Xmen franchise. This is a franchise that has the worst track record at telling an effective story. Wolverine Origins? Xmen 3? Hell, even Xmen 1, despite its importance, had terrible characters.

What this movie did very well in my opinion was the love story. It was the perfect balance of being what drove the movie (alongside the revenge story), without taking up much screen time - and when it did take up screen time it was either heartwarming or hilarious. 

I thought the villain story was a little weak, but it was actually fairly logical and I don't think there were many different ways it could play out. Not much depth to the movie in that aspect, but it's a comedy primarily, so what can you expect?

The goriest parts (such as the man splatting against the motorway sign and the metal chain/cable cutting off the biker's head in mid-air) were also very brief, unrealistic and heavily stylised. 

I agree that a 15 is a little too low but I can see why a 15 was chosen over 18 as I'd personally have no problem with 16/17 year olds seeing it. 

What I think the UK needs is an age rating in between 15 and 18 - an example would be the 15A/16/18 model used in Ireland - to cover films on the 15/18 borderline such as this one (incidentally, Deadpool did get a 16 rating in Ireland).

There are some inside jokes (for example, a certain scene wouldn't be as funny if you didn't know Deadpool's relationship with Wolverine from the X-Men), but they're quick and if you aren't familiar, you probably won't even notice.

Probably the most interesting thing about him though is that he's self aware that he's a character in a story. In the comics he hears the text boxes as voices in his head and he talks directly to the reader. In the movie he's constantly addressing the viewer directly at occasionally even adjusting the camera.

So Ajax picks her up and tosses her 100 feet and then Deadpool ends up saving her from the ship exploding. But she was pretty self reliant for being a street walker from Boston (and not mentioned to be a mutant in this storyline). 

I imagine if she somehow got herself off an exploding Naval Ship that Negasonic blew up, we'd all be sitting here complaining that a normal person (not identified as a Mutant (yet)) did all this shit herself and all Deadpool was there for was revenge.

The way they handled it worked perfectly for me. She was able to be self reliant, more so than any other human in the movie, but she did need help getting off a however-many-storied ship that was  in the process of blowing up, giving Deadpool the chance to be heroic towards the one thing he loves in the world.",45cn7c

czxocon,"I didn't mind Vanessa getting rescued because it wasn't the typical ""man saves woman"", it was ""supermutant saves human."" Negasonic Teenage Warhead saved Colossus (who was getting his ass kicked by a woman), so the typical ""women need men saving them"" aspect wasn't very consistent throughout the movie. Vanessa was actually pretty badass, pulling a sword out with her bare hands and stabbing it through Ajax. If he wasn't a mutant he would've died and she would've saved herself. 

Also, I didn't mind Ajax being one-dimensional because this was the origin story. We know Deadpool 2 is going to have Cable, and I think it's going to also include whoever was pulling Ajax's strings. Francis was not the leader, just the torturer.  

Additionally, I think they're going to kill off Vanessa in Deadpool 2 and make him a little more depressed and a little crazier. I think it would be interesting to have his relationship with Death potentially just be all in his mind (and Death could even be Vanessa with some CGI changes). ",45cn7c

d00kwik,"Saw it last night and someone had a really young kid, sounded like a little girl maybe 5-6, because every time they showed Reynolds face she started crying. They sat through the entire movie. I would have done some cursory research about a movie I'm taking my child to see if they are young, but even then if I'd fucked up and ended up in a violent movie with all sorts of adult stuff going down I'd have eaten the cost of the ticket and left. Maybe seen something else or Redboxed anything that wouldn't give my kid nightmares for the rest of her life. 

Even better, there was a redneck vaping two seats over from us. Then this lady and guy sit between vaping guy and me and the wife, and they have a shit ton of snacks and at the end where he is like ""don't leave your trash everywhere, it's a total dick move"" they literally left shit everywhere.

> ""Her name was cool, and we kind of wanted a straight-man to play against Colossus,"" Miller said.

czwz6m4,"A lot of folks shit on Daniel Way's post Cable & Deadpool run of the solo comic. I enjoyed it. Maybe that makes me a bad person, I dunno. Way's style of humor *was* more geared toward the dank memes crowd and that didn't resonate with most of the original Joe Kelly-era fans.  Humor is subjective. Some of the jokes in this film didn't land with me personally... But I was laughing alone in the theater a few times.  I thought the writers did a good job of hitting multiple marks. The comics seem to have a more decisive split because runs are rooted in a single writer's comedic sensibilities.",45cn7c

Fade in: 

EXT: WHEREEVERTHEFUCK PRISON

The prison alarm blares. 

Many guards are running to wherever guards run to in emergency prison situations.

The emergency is that DEAD POOL is breaking in to save the CAB DRIVER. 

A mess of dead guards lie in his wake as he fights toward a giant air conditioning vent which obviously leads inside the building. 

As DEAD POOL snaps the neck of PRISON GUARD 1 he looks at the camera. 

>DEAD POOL

>What? They were corrupt. Well Some of them were. Enough of them. Whatevs. I am breaking into prison to rescue the cab driver from the first movie. 

He moves off, sprinting ever closer to his final destination.


INT: PRISON

Prisoners in open revolt. Flaming toilet paper and other cliche prison riot mise en plas are at work.

PRISON GUARD 2 gets too close to the bars and is grabbed by the tattoo covered arms of INMATE 1. As he is stabbed to death, INMATE 2 liberates PRISON GUARD 2's keys

INMATE 2 opens the cell door. 

INT CAB DRIVER CELL:

The CAB DRIVER cowers in a corner. Above him is INMATE 3 the cliche prison bully, shiv at the ready.

>CAB DRIVER

>I should have been played by Kumail Nanjiani. 

CAB DRIVER flinches preparing to die any moment.

The humor is kinda hard to explain. It's kinda like a Bugs Bunny cartoon. It's witty, referential, and physical all while including cursing and low-brow humor, but there is an intelligence to it all. The trailer does get to feel a bit tired, but when you are sitting in the theater(imo) it doesn't feel tired at all. Generally, I find myself uninterested in the more typical Seth Rogan/Will Ferrell comedy these days, so the fact that the adolescent humor didn't bug me at all was surprising.

The wife loved it and she knows zero about the comics. I have tried to explain a few things, but ultimately, the movie relied on its own development to earn viewer credibility.

Honestly, the story had some drama to it, which I didn't expect. The characters and actors all have superb chemistry and the love story might be the most organic I have yet seen in a super hero flick. Everything just works.

He is exactly like that, he can be serious but that is the most rare thing that can happen, he has some serious mental issues and is immortal, everything is a joke to him, since that is the only way he can deal with the constant pain and healing of is injuries.

Maybe that part didnt came through clearly in the movie, but his pain is not there and then gets healed and everything is fine, he is in constant traumatizing pain that would make the normal human being writhe on the floor in agony and paralyze them, but since he gets healed the pain will NEVER stop.

That is the reason he is mental, also he feels pain, just because he heals doesnt mean he doesnt feels what is being done to him.

To joke about literally everything, imitation voices, doing a voice over or repeating some advertising songs is his way of coping with the constant pain he is feeling.

Especially some of the 4th wall stuff.

I can understand that this kind of comedy is not for everyone, but that is Deadpool and i am more than happy that they went with it in the movie.

>a Helicarrier has four turbines

They could easily pass the helicarrier off as an early version. The turbines did look a whole lot different from the one's in the Avengers I'll give you that. It looked more true to the [comic helicarrier](http://scientificgamer.com/the-shield-helicarrier/)

[Another version.](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/File:S.H.I.E.L.D._Helicarrier_from_Secret_Avengers_Vol_2_15.jpg)

I don't see why they would put a helicarrier in the movie though if they didn't intend for people to think its the same universe as the Avengers. The average viewer thinks, ""Hey, that aircraft carrier had turbines on it just like in the Avengers"" not ""Hey, that aircraft carrier had turbines on it, but they didn't look exactly the same as the one in the Avengers so they must not be related."" Marvel may not officially recognize it, but Fox is definitely leaving bread crumbs. 

Also Ryan Reynolds put up a TV spot for Deadpool called [""New TV spot. Is that a helicarrier?""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veFy7zZ12U8). The intention was clearly to insinuate its a helicarrier.

czz8yk7,"While not everything landed (Deadpool is more about quantity than quality after all), a good number of the lines were good and didn't rely on being just crass or sexual, there was a great deal of set up and payoff jokes.

d03atfp,"> You hit the nail on the head, this movie was designed for 13 year old boys and fedora wearers who think non-stop dick jokes is the highest comedy can reach.

Or you know, some people are able to enjoy dick and fart jokes and not think it's ""the highest comedy can reach"".  I love the smart humor of a Coen Brothers film, but I also can turn my brain down a notch and enjoy Deadpool making jokes about bullets going down his asshole.  

I mean do you honestly think 90% of Reddit consists of fedora wearing neckbeards and teenagers?  It's always a bit weird when the minority opinion lashes out at everyone else in the world being a niche demographic.
At the same time I highly doubt you'll find anyone in this thread claiming this is the height of comedy or a masterpiece.  Just a really fun popcorn movie.  Sucks you guys didn't have fun.",45cn7c

d09ykmi,"Well I'm no expert but I'll give it a try. Think of the actor's stage (even action movies are performed on a stage) as a 3d cube with 6 faces. The top is the roof (raise the roof), the bottom is the actual stage. The walls of the cube are where people can view the stage performance from. The performance is directed toward only one wall... the one facing the audience. The wings and the backstage are part of the show... they can watch the play, but the magic is broken for them, (ie. they hear cue calls, they see actors rushing past half-dressed, etc.). So in any play there are three pre-broken walls. This is just how I've always understood it in my own mind.

The fourth wall is supposed to never be broken, as the magic needs to keep going for the audience (""the show must go on"") no matter what. However, if it's in line with the character and story, every once in a while you can get away with saying something to the audience ordinarily reserved for crew or fellows backstage/in the wings. You let the audience in on the reality of the play, and thereby break 'the magic' of the fourth wall. It is/was considered a risky move in theatre but can be quite memorable if played well.

Deadpool takes this concept and beats it to death in the face just like he does his enemies. Maximum effort. He breaks the fourth wall like it's a bodily function. Almost to the point that, as many other more-Deadpool-savvy redditors have pointed out, he definitely knows he is a comic-book character and feels trapped by the fact he therefore knows he will/can never die.

But in terms of the movie, it is very rare or perhaps never been done (someone correct me?) where a scene was filmed that contained a fourth wall break, while 'within' a flashback scene of another fourth wall break. That is why he said the line ""that's like sixteen walls"" because he may be referring to the idea of a cube within a cube... often a flashback scene is played in the corner of a stage, so they technically have their own 'sub-stage', (sorry I'm really no expert), so breaking the wall within that would add more walls having been broken. But the number is wrong... no matter how I think about it... so my guess is that the final part to this joke is how famously bad Deadpool is at math.

Anyways if you wanna know, during the part of the movie when Deadpool said ""Hey Jared... I'll take a footlong, fully loaded"" I kinda freaked out, since I am both named Jared and I used to work at Subway. I didn't get the joke at first because I was reeling from trying to figure out if he was literally talking to me directly as some kind of new techno-prank or whatever. Also my date punched me in the arm when it happened so that didn't help.

What a great fucking movie.

Tl/dr; Deadpool broke the 4th wall during a 4th wall flashback and knew it meant more broken walls but he's bad at math.

Edit: Removed spoilers tags cuz I'm dumb",45cn7c
d09px3h,"""breaking the 4th wall"" is when a character in a movie/game/tv show/play directly addresses the audience. The 4th wall in a play is the Audience's view of the stage, so when a character breaks through that wall they are looking at the audience and are aware they are in a play.

Deadpool as a character is known for doing this, he is aware that he is in a comic book and will sometimes use this to his advantage. By reading ahead to know what to do for example.",45cn7c

These properties all belong together, regardless of how they perform in theaters and the fact that FOX is unwilling to even consider something similar to what SONY and MARVEL are doing is just plainly due to greed. This philosophy of ""Well we're making Lotsa Money"" is shitty because at the sam time they aren't even concerned with the fact that they are tearing apart some of the main staples of what makes MARVEL, well, MARVEL. All of these intellectual properties belong together and would even make it that much better, regardless of who owns what :)",45cn7c

The bigger issue though is so much of the humour relies on a good understanding of the current superhero genre. When people are not longer use to seeing 4-5 Marvel blockbusters a year, then the film will seem a lot more out of place.

References to Adventure Time, The Marvel/Mutant controversy, a random helicarrier, Reynolds Green Lantern, Deadpools appearance in that Wolverine Movie, Hugh Jackmans Face ect. Even slang like ""douchbag"" and ""Asshat"" is very ephemeral, and could be the equivalent of ""bodacious"" in the 2020's.

He did get paid, with a crisp five. Aside from that, the dude got some helpful advice from Mr. Pool. He encouraged him to follow his heart!

This movie is massive fan service, the constant fourth wall breaking is very in line with the character. In the books he's the only character in the marvel universe who is aware that he's a comic book character. It kind of makes him the most powerful character in the books.

Pretty Woman.

If you're around someone and all they say is LIKE LIKE LIKE do you honesty think you'd be fine with that? Swearing is no different than any other repeated word ad nauseum. 

Anything can be too much and in a film when it's too much it's far too distracting. I feel as if the amount was to distract from the holes Deadpool has in the story telling that I'm sure they know exist. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why the torture segment of this film lasted as long as it did. They could've halved that time and put more effort in to building a relationship between him and her that hinged more on them and less on how many times on holidays they have sex and who can up the other. 

The sex montage was far too long. Had it been shorter I wouldn't have figured out the ""gag"" of him being next to be plowed. It would've been funnier. Somethings were off time. 

NOT enough for me to find the film awful. I was afraid that they'd miss the mark on the humor and they didn't. I was afraid that they'd overdo the violence just to make it R and they didn't. It was enough without being over the top. 

People complain about silly Deadpool like in the video game and how that's not him. I think a good balance of him being silly and caustic would have been nice. I think it fell too heavily on the sarcasm weighed with swearing...it sounded (by the end of the film) as if I was listening to a valley girl except she swore in between the necessary words. 

It is tiresome to come to /r/movies and finding out that in some instances it's like /r/politics where there's only one view and if that's not your view...you're not welcomed. It's too bad that doesn't scare me away, though.",45cn7c

czxa2zo,"I want to disagree with you so badly about the Jared joke. I think I'm not including that because I found it so absolutely hilarious. You're right though.

In general though I think the film has enough jokes to be funny into the future without most of it being a head scratcher.

I mean look at something like The Muppet Show, that was on TV in the 70s and sure there are some jokes I don't understand but 90% of it is still good to go. I think Deadpool will be exactly like that.",45cn7c

d00ht0s,"He sharpens his swords and knows how to use them. And really most of Deadpool's powers are just actually from him being in as peak of a condition the human body can theoretically be, the reason he is above peak human athletes and the natural human limits is because of his healing factor removing the natural decay working out puts on the body. If the character wasn't a hitman/mercenary/general good bad-guy and just veged for longer than he usually does between jobs, he would lose his skills and fitness like normal people just slower, because of his healing factor. 

**Sort of long tl;dr:** All of his ""powers"" come from people justifying fantasy comic panels of a character that is ""best friends"" with a cyborg mutant from the future that has telekinesis sometimes and is infected with a technovirus other times. Also the first character killed his multiverse ending self from another universe once, so that happened.",45cn7c

d126mmr,"I thought the action was well done and snappy.  A dance of destruction.

I wish they would make 5 movies with low budgets like this instead of 1 film with a huge budget.

And to be quite frank... CGI served the story here.  There is a tendency in larger budget movies to show some CGI scene which is supposed to be spectacular and you know it's CGI so it has no emotional impact.   Here the CGI punched things up but was never the focus.

I was aware of the deadpool character but never read the comics.  My favorite character is captain america (and I think they are doing a great job with him in the movies).   I enjoyed this film immensely.  I started laughing in the credits and didn't stop until almost a minute after the last post credits easter egg.

I had avoided all trailers and went in ""cold"" except I knew it had a lot of offensive shit.   I think that's all you need to know going in to enjoy the film. ",45cn7c

czyq5f6,"Like I said nothing wrong with laughing at the jokes, but when you're the only one who laughs at the ""it would be a bad idea to sew my mouth shut"" complete with guffaw and applause, it's like you want other people to know you got the joke. Laughter is involuntary, but no one needs to be literally slapping their knees when they're the only one in the theater making noise. Don't be the one guy whos laugh everyone in the theater has nightmares about. 

Edit: Also, I didn't mean to shit on the guys because they were old, honestly probably not much older than me. I just pointed it out because of how much reddit complains about children in movie theaters, while these particular guys were basically reddit incarnate. ",45cn7c

This is by no means an Oscar worthy movie, but that wasn't its intended goal. If you went to see this movie with the intent of watching a cinematic masterpiece, you screwed up. *Deadpool* set out to do exactly what it did, and that was tell a crude, violent, self aware, and funny story.

The average viewer doesn't even think that's the Helicarrier at all. Just an aircraft carrier. Because that's what it is.

It's also probably worth noting that the YouTube spot you posted was almost immediately blocked on copyright laws before it got back on.

As for the insanity, that was post-Priest I believe, explained as the Weapon X program breaking his mind. Then a few years later he started developing multiple personality thought bubbles, but this was the mid-00's thereabouts when he went full-on insane.

Duggan retconned the insanity and fourth-wall-breaking to be hallucinogenics used by the scientists in the defunct but reawoken Weapon X program to continue their research on him years later, but Cullen Bunn continued to write the weirder miniseries and one-shots.

Insane Deadpool hasn't really been a thing the last few years in his main books, but when he shows up in other stories people don't pay attention to the fact that Deadpool's basically been ""cured"" of his insanity and is now just a highly effective dickwad with no sense of personal boundaries or propriety.",45cn7c

I'd agree that the movie could be off-putting at times for women, but not for those reasons. There was more male nudity than female, if I'm not mistaken (was impressed they actually showed the danglers during that fight scene).

The romance, though, and Baccarin's character could have been done better. She's a prostitute, cool. This is mentioned exactly once and immediately thereafter we're shown the relationship montage- it's great that they didn't show the sappy ""I'm going to quit walking the streets for you"" scene, but just having it assumed still isn't great for the character's depth.

So she goes straight from hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold to perfect nurturing suburban housewife- oh, and did I mention she's also a geek? ""Empire!"" Lol. I'm not sure whether it was her delivery or just the line itself, but I felt like it crossed the line from thematic banter to tasteless pandering for just a moment there.

And then once he disappears, she goes back to... being a waitress?  At a *strip club*? I mean, sure, I can understand if she doesn't want to get back into hooking, but if that's the case a strip club should be the last place she'd want to work.

She has no apparent character flaws, and all around just felt too two-dimensional- given that I rolled my eyes at her lines a few times, I can see how women might feel the same.

I heard that they didn't actually end up getting back together in the books- if her character doesn't ever really get developed there, it could explain why that's the case in the movie as well.",45cn7c

It's stupid to praise a movie for not having these things. I loved Deadpool. Not because of the reason you listed. 

You were downvoted because what you said is cringeworthy. It boils down to ""My manly movie dont give a shit about those feminazis trying to ruin Hollywood.""

You're praising something for being the rule. Star wars and mad max were praised for being the exception. ""Side stepping the gender issue"" is what most movies do. It's nothing special. I hate when movies force characters in for the sake of diversity. If Max in Mad Max were made a girl for the sake of having a strong female cast I'd be pissed. That said, i love Furiosa and what she brings to the movie. 

Basically, Deadpool is like most movies in that it doesnt make an effort to include stronger women. You praising it for having a woman that needs to be saved is neckbeard to the max. Someone complaining about it having a woman to save is just as ridiculus in my mind. It's a non-issue. Both sides should get over themselves.

DoFP fractures the time lines effectively changing all of the events of X1-3 and the wolverine (Japan one) allowing them to go on and save the world with largely the original team from X1. 

However, the first class, dofp story will continue into apocalypse however in a different time line, effectively independent of the other films. 

Confusing the fuck out of anyone that doesn't care enough to pay more than the normal amount of attention to these films. I think the success of these films has largely been a fluke - not at all well planned.

Maybe after DoFP, mutant Wade Wilson had an identical child named Wade Wilson, and that Wade Wilson is the one in the movie.

> It’s not just a ship though. Informed fans will no doubt notice that the structure where the finale of the film takes place is actually a busted up helicarrier rotting away in the junk yard, a not-so subtle jab at rival Marvel Studios who have used the airship in a number of their films.

And if we're going to get into the semantics of what is and what isn't an ""excellent Deadpool"", I can do that too. This *Deadpool* isn't the Deadpool from the comics. Beyond the gore, the comics would be at the extreme end of a PG-13 film. It relied less on swearing and nudity; the film says ""Fuck nuance"" and exploits the R-rating for all the manchildren who are under the assumption Deadpool is supposed to have these things.

The comics had a more nuanced Deadpool that straddled the fine line between between being an asshole and an asshole that was trying to redeem himself (and failing); film Deadpool is simply an irredeemable asshole. The Wade Wilson in the comic books never had a sense of humour until after the Weapon X program drove him mad and into becoming the Merc With A Mouth; film Wade Wilson was a motor-mouth even before he became Deadpool. I'd get into how important Weasel and Blind Al are to Deadpool's characterization and how their underutilization is a detriment in the film, but I suspect it'll fall on deaf ears.

Are we still going to discuss how a film should be judged based on everything a film is supposed to encompass and/or pretend you know about what constitutes a proper Deadpool story/film?",45cn7c

> Notice how I then brought up everything I believed were negatives in the next paragraph **after** removing the R-rating and Reynolds' performance? 

You seem to be operating under the assumption of me saying it should be literally taken out of the film. I'm not. I'm saying it should be taken out the picture to better assess how the film isn't any different from other superhero films due to their shared flaws. I'm saying the R-rating doesn't magically absolve *Deadpool* of the same formulaic crimes it shares with PG-13 superhero films.

Other than that yeah Vanessa wasn't as fleshed out as she should have been , that's why romantic interests in action movies are always super lame for me. I'd rather the female supporting character not be a romantic interest at all so that the writers would be forced to think about something else when it comes to her personality and relationship with the male lead. What comes to mind is Emily Blunt in Edge of Tomorrow until the very last act. She was fully fleshed out and could stand on her own. 

As for the Vanessa being a geek that made think about 'Gone Girl' which I've been reading at a painfully slow pace for almost two years (I only read in public transports, sometimes I don't, sometime I fell asleep) and there was this part about ""cool girls"" girls who pretend to like whatever their SO is into because it's cool, and men like cool girls.

I agree with you that downvoting because of disagreement is bad, but just pointing out that for me, personally, I didn't downvote because I disagreed with his opinion, but that it didn't add anything. I didn't downvote your comment however, I liked that you were trying to discourage downvoters purely for disagreement. I was just politely disagreeing with you about the specifics. Hope you didn't take offence!

edit: Looking at your linked comments, I understand your point that there were many positive, useless comments. That's a fair point! I guess if I were being honest I don't really care about those as much! Though I'd feel that way even if I didn't like the movie. My personal bias is that, most of the things that I post are links to stuff that I've created. I usually browse through comments with the following philosophy about comments:

- positive fluff: nice but I very quickly peruse
- Positive criticism: GOLD, I carefully review these
- negative criticism: I try to keep my ego in check and pay attention to these
- negative fluff: I pretend it's not there/ downvote

d05hyvn," I knew who Dead Pool was, and thought it was....okay. It's rarely laugh out loud funny. Very simplistic, and immature, which I suppose is the point. I went in skeptical, because I know the source material, and I'm not fond of it. Reminds me of everything wrong with 90s comics. Being extreme, and over-the-top just to be extreme and over-the-top. ""I'm breaking the 4th wall for the millionth time, isn't that funny?"" Even 16 year old me didn't care much for Dead Pool when he first came out. This is really a film for teens and young adults who love childish South Park type humor. Everyone else will have pretty mixed feelings about it.

That said, the movie moved along at a fair pace. I liked Colossus, and his big heart playing straight man to Dead Pool's slapstick antics. I've always thought that the chick playing Wade's girlfriend was hot since seeing her in Firefly and then Homeland (and now Gotham). I liked the hat tip to Ferris Bueller's Day Off. I got all of the 80s references, cause I'm old like that. And I have to admit that there were one or two scenes that I found legitimately funny enough to laugh out loud to, but most of it got barely a chuckle from me.

1) I figured Colossus dumped her in a holding cell in the Blackbird

2) Blind Al is his roommate in the comics, a lot of fans wouldn't have been happy if she wasn't at least mentioned, and she says in the movie she found him on Craigslist (retcon from the comics, but explaining her backstory and how she came to live with DP would have dragged out the movie way too long and added unnecessary complications to his quasi-hero status

3) During the reunion, she says it's been 2 years.  It was a quick line, but they did establish how long they were apart with it",45cn7c

czzxqpw,"I agree that strong characters of both genders are good. Its silly to think women in more traditional gender roles cannot be strong characters. You dont need to have something completely unrealistic like a 105lb woman beating up multiple 200lb men. 

Again I dont mind feminist movies. I support whatever the artist's vision is. I strongly believe these movies dont deserve to be lauded because they are presenting women in a way a very vocal minority prefers them to be. A woman being the main character of Star Wars is completely cool but the fact they wrote a full blown Mary Sue with zero flaws is silly imo. That was the creator's vision though. Who am I to try and change that?

Its funny you think neckbeard as some ad hominem. I m not fat, out of shape or neckbearded.

I am not like the PC crowd, I don't want to censor or eliminate art I don't agree with. I want people free to make the most PC feminist movies they can think of. I also want someone to be able to make the most non-pc, conservative movie. I abhor their goal of eliminating the damsel in distress trope because it is as old as human story telling. Im happy it isnt disappearing because of bullying from a very small minority of silly people.

My wife loved Jurassic Park flick because she thought the Parks & Recs guy was a hot badass. She didn't like Fury Road, thought it was gross. I liked mad max more than her. It isnt just men who prefer the traditional stuff sometimes. A lot of it speaks to our biology.

""Dude we've got to get rid of that inception joke. It's just not funny anymore.""

""It just sucks man... it's like we broke sixteen 4th walls with that joke back in 2010.""

""Wait, what did you just say?""",45cn7c
czywgkw,Ahh. So that's how he can regenerate from nothing. Gotcha. I'll look into more but I was sitting in the theater waiting for the credit scene. Thank you. ,45cn7c
czxflw6,[deleted],45cn7c
czxw88m,She still did it. A human saved a super human from another super human. I think your standards are too high. ,45cn7c
czxpr52,I watched Dirty Grandpa with my parents. We play fucking cards against humanity together all the time. Shits only awkward of you make it awkward. ,45cn7c
czxoono,"I watched it with my mom. She jokingly said ""cover your eyes"" during the sex, strip club, and Deadpool-penis-flopping-around scenes. But we knew what we were getting into haha",45cn7c
czxowbs,"I didn't even want to see it with my brother. Told him I probably wasn't up to it, but in reality I saw the showing that started just after his finished in the same theatre haha.",45cn7c
d06yxu0,"15 here, just watched it with my mom half an hour ago. She fucking loved it. ",45cn7c
d2p2yk9,why is that weird? you realise your parents are people who've seen and done more shit than you probably have lol,45cn7c
czx97dw,"Yeah, same here. Especially the crack on not studios not being able to afford anymore X-Men. The theatre couldn't stop laughing for some reason.",45cn7c
czxpn2u,Same with me! I missed that joke and was so annoyed as everyone was laughing so fucking loud,45cn7c
d0t1ysk,what the fuck is wrong with you,45cn7c
d00fdu9,"I can buy that. 

",45cn7c
czx71tn,*kidnap her*,45cn7c
czxdwpm,Also a hello kitty bag.,45cn7c
czyjq2u,"That, would be awesome",45cn7c
d0jhl86,"I think that was my favorite exchange in the whole movie.

Was expecting her to do the standard ""flex the powers to show I'm tough"".",45cn7c
czxclr7,I was referring to the fact that they didn't want to pay for the rights to show the logo and such. Everyone knows what it is but it doesn't cost them a dime to use.,45cn7c
czxevqq,Haha oh maybe!,45cn7c
czx3kmk,"I wholeheartedly agree, but the fact that it was just kept my attention every time I heard it dropped another time.",45cn7c
d00stsr,"He explained it to her, because he thought she might be too young to get the reference. Made sense in the context of the situation.",45cn7c
d00dins,"It should be noted that the Fox X-Men Cinematic Universe and the Marvel Cinematic Universe are completely different and so far have had no sign of interacting in any way shape or form whatsoever.
Heck, They have two different Quicksilvers! Had. So the heicarrier here was indeed a helicarrier, but not one of the MCU variety. The lifter fans are in pods, not fenestrons, and there is no SHIELD logo anywhere. Just sayin'.",45cn7c
d00el74,"Dude, it's completely separate from the MCU. The characters and story lines do not ever cross. ",45cn7c
d00zvx7,I was gonna say something along these lines. Thank you :),45cn7c
d074iby,Maybe we'll get a spin off.,45cn7c
d07x7m0,And possession of a shit load of weapons and ammunition.,45cn7c
d02wbwk,"I mean, I'm not saying the joke itself is random. I'm saying, people with that sense of humor are the ones who tend to find that kind of joke funny. That wasn't the only joke of that calibur either. The whole movie is chock full of em.

""Let's dance, no, let's fight"" xD xD

We can go on here. I seriously want to know how people found every one liner funny. I know people have different senses of humor but, will you admit that its cheesy and not clever at all?",45cn7c
d037615,Deadpool is annoying. That's the point. He annoys....all other heroes and villains. He's not known for being well liked.,45cn7c
czzu6a5,Totally saw some dick action here. Also I am pretty sure I saw half of so of Vanessas mound and pubes riding Wade. ,45cn7c
d0017rv,"I saw boobs, don't recall any vaginas. But maybe it was just my memory.",45cn7c
czyn2gd,He loved it so much he took it home. ,45cn7c
d0353hc,[deleted],45cn7c
czx00b8,Hahaha hah ,45cn7c
czxjob7,well Ajax just sounds silly,45cn7c
d00z39z,That's a good question.,45cn7c
czybxsd,Aha. Just didn't understand which character it referred to.,45cn7c
czx1hfo,I don't remember seeing jet turbines.,45cn7c

d00k3p9,it's 15 here in Norway ,45cn7c
d00iqm1,"They're more liberal about sex over there. In terms of the violence though, yeah I get that that was pretty over the top. I still don't most the people I know would have been bothered by a movie like this at 12 years old though, in fact we would've really liked it. ",45cn7c
czz3byc,...BANG.,45cn7c
czyfbk3,Are there some peer reviewed studies that demonstrate letting kids watch a movie like this at that age makes them awful kids?,45cn7c
czxb6xn,"Well your 20 y/o friend can buy their own ticket. 17 is the cut off age for R rated to buy your own ticket, but buying multiple tickets without an ID for each person is 21+",45cn7c

czzxlvj,"I recall Wade saying ""Thanks, Weas"" (short for Weasel) at one point also. ",45cn7c
d03ih1k,"Well in Court Fox could just be like: ""No one said it was SHIELD Helicarrier"". Its just a Aircraft carrier that looks like it can fly but can't really cuz it got destroyed in a battle ;) ",45cn7c
czxc5o2,"I think it was a child molester joke for sure. In the bar Wade kept making child molester jokes at him, slightly misquoted forsure, like ""Hey buddy we're within 500 feet of a school"" and ""the only thing I won't help you with is getting children into a side paneled mini van.""

It wasn't until his next interaction with him that he started calling him Jared.",45cn7c
czzg30q,"becouse of the jokes and him asking why there still there, im willing to bet most of em really dident get the refrence in of itself.",45cn7c
d00pm4d,"I was going off the canon wiki. Wade looked way older than early thirties, and why couldnt he had been a clone? Striker has done a bunch of shady stuff. Either way I feel like what happened at the state fair proves my point.",45cn7c
d03rffq,"Agreed, that was REALLY fucking cool. I love shit like that in movies.",45cn7c
czyi0e0,"Edit: Nevermind! Wow, I didn't know miller directed. Thats... meta. Amazing.",45cn7c

czx7lxa,"I was more under the impression that the line before it ""It looks like things have gone sideways in the worst possible way..."" then immediately cutting to the figure was a jab at the crap Deadpool from Origins. Seems to fit a lot more IMO",45cn7c
czx899d,We all do.  Including Deadpool.,45cn7c

-if that's your argument you come off more childish than an intoxicated comic lover in their late twenties like me.",45cn7c

czzb5bc,"I'm rewatching it tomorrow, I'll pay more attention during that scene and get back to you. If it is a Helicarrier it probably isn't the one from the Avengers.",45cn7c
czxqbos,"> Sinead O'Connor? I'd be surprised if anyone under the age of 30 laughed at that.

Um, I'm 16 and both understood and laughed at the Sinead O'Connor jokes 

(just saying :) )",45cn7c
czytbwy,These timelines are so confusing.,45cn7c
czyurnj,X-men are not in the Avengers/ MCU universe. Deadpool though is supposed to be in the X-men universe. So Captain America couldn't show up(I could see Evans) but Wolverine could. ,45cn7c
czyz6mq,"no, they're not",45cn7c
d006r0r,"theres also a comic where cap knock out the hulk or another where he does another stupid feat. im not a fan of comic book feats. but still cap is always being hailed as a really good fighter, no?",45cn7c
d080003,"Dude what you all do in rural Alaska for fun?  I see you can't goto watch a movie for sure.  So Playstation, NetFlix, Reddit right?",45cn7c
czyalqk," I'd say this might not be an ""excellent"" Deadpool, but it's a ""pretty good"" interpretation of the character. Hell, I would say it's more accurate than a significantly portion of the comics interpretations after Joe Kelly's run. 

It's not 100% accurate and the profanity is a new addition, but I'd say the film captures the character quite well, certainly better than writers like Daniel Way who reduced the character to an incompetent meme spouting clown.

I wouldn't say the film's version is an irredeemable asshole as despite his reluctance to be labeled a hero, he does exhibit Deadpool's desire to help people in a twisted way and shows kindness to those he cares about. 

On a side note, Weasel and (especially) Blind Al more or less disappeared completely after a certain point in the comics. He's had something of a revolving door when it comes to his supporting cast unfortunately.

I'm just happy the film draws so much from Joe Kelly's work both in terms of plot and thematically. The foundation Kelly built is often thrown by the way side in modern Deadpool comics.",45cn7c
czx2fz8,">by looking at *everything* that makes it a film

Yet in your OP you took out many parts that made it the film that it is (such as the performance of the actor who portrayed Deadpool). How can I take you seriously after that? You can't seem to wrap your head around the fact that this wasn't supposed to be some fantastic pinnacle of cinema. It did what it set out to be and the resounding response should make that pretty crystal clear. 

You clearly didn't like the humor employed in this film, which is totally fine, and went in with the mindset that it was supposed to be something it was not. If you want to look at it specifically from a technical aspect, devoid of any other metrics, yes, it wasn't the best film in the world. What I and many others agree with, is that it was a good Deadpool movie because that's what it was trying to be. I'm not even going to get into your laughable excuses for why it isn't a Deadpool movie. I honestly cannot fathom the person who watched the trailers for this movie, then left the theater and complained about it by taking out *exactly what was at the center of the fucking movie and the center of the trailers*. It's like buying a Toyota Corolla and calling it a shitty car for not being as fast as a Mustang. They're two different things. 

It's completely within reason to say you didn't like the humor and thus didn't enjoy the movie, but to call it a bad movie from the perspective of removing all those humorous aspects (such as the jokes and Ryan Reynolds performance) is just ridiculous man. ",45cn7c
czxvx6l,"I obviously don't think you're suggesting it be *literally* removed from the movie, I'm saying to ignore all of that in order to evaluate it as a film is dumb. This is a superhero movie in the same way Team America is a cop movie. Nobody gives a shit that the plot is formulaic. It's a comedy, and I (and most people) found it very funny. Therefore, it's a good comedy movie.

Perhaps if you spent less time with your coloring books you'd understand genres better.",45cn7c
d037on2,"Yeah I guess this really comes down to being a Deadpool fan prior to going into it, or being a fan of cheesy, easy, fedora tilt type (sorry) one liners",45cn7c
d02w4ds,Agreed. Lowest hanging fruit wins I guess,45cn7c
d02wow6,even breaks through a literal wall,45cn7c
czxf0rj,"no no, I LOVED the movie. my original comment was sarcasm. I thought it was obvious, but apparently not. ",45cn7c
czz9436,"The other ones were farting jokes. Again, high quality stuff. I just don't get how the fucking dialog writer thought those jokes are funny. I just can't understand. That's my 14 years old brother level of humor.",45cn7c
d00o6wn,"That movie had so many good one liners of varying levels of maturity, don't act like it was all dart and boner jokes (even though there were a lot of them). 

There were plenty of other great jokes

""Have fun at your midnight showing of Blade 2""

""You better hope you can't feel anything down the the last nerve, because I'm gonna go looking""

And pretty much anything with Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead",45cn7c
czx05x3,I'm pretty sure it wasn't a Helicarrier because it didn't look like a Helicarrier nor are FOX allowed to use the Helicarrier. They could barely be bothered to put any X-Men in the movie and they own the rights to that.,45cn7c
czxrzpa,"Every super hero story is like that. I don't know why people use that as a valid reason to dislike a movie. All that says is the genre isn't for you. That's like going to RomComs and complaining it's just another ""guy fights for girl"" movie. No shit, it's part of the genre lol.",45cn7c
czx0csf,"If you boil any story down to just a list of generic plot points, you'll find most stories are the same or very, very similar. It's the how and whys that go into the stories that separate them from others, which I feel Deadpool did exceedingly well. ",45cn7c
czxyno4,"I would say the film subverted those expectations while playing within that structure.

Man lives bizarre and amoral life. Man gets changed. Man gets turned into a monster. Man uses superpowers to go on a violent killing spree in search for revenge. Man kills bad guy. Man is still awful person.",45cn7c
czxznw6,"That's just the first movie usually. But superhero movies are starting to move away from that formula. Dr. Strange won't be an origin story. It'll start when he has his powers and from what I understand, it won't be explaining how he got them. But I mean, from an action movie in general that's what you get. Good guy takes down bad guy. I don't really know how you could make an action movie any other way. ",45cn7c
czwzlx7,"That's like saying a god damn Bugatti is just a stereotypical car like a fucking Honda Civic, completely ignoring everything else that makes this movie different. ",45cn7c
czz5x7a,okay! what bugs you about super hero movies!,45cn7c
czz93d0,"Kind of an aside point, but while I wish the violence was cranked up just a bit more, I felt that worked really well being on screen for just that split second.  Just enough time to realize what happened and get the visual, then on to the next thing instead of hanging on that to sell it like many other movies would.",45cn7c
czyby9n,Ah. I get it. Thanks. I needed to know about Cable and the hairstyle to get it. And I didn't know about either.,45cn7c
d008wzm,ok ;). ,45cn7c
d05s6rv,The entire thing. You show me where any of that was true. ,45cn7c
czy1u5k,"Please, friend. Reconsider your chosen course of actions.",45cn7c
d00zc41,Sharing an opinion on a film isn't angry. Telling someone they're stupid for not agreeing with you is. Which is what you did.,45cn7c
czzwsgk,I don't claim to be a real fan. I guess what I meant by that was people who claim to be true fans and into it. I actually haven't read many Deadpool comics and only like the character because of the humor. I realize that comment makes me sound like an ass.,45cn7c
czyjl6p,I think it'll rhyme with *Bable*,45cn7c
czyseen,That butt looked so gooood!,45cn7c
czyn80a,"That would have been hilarious. I mean he just got stabbed with a piece of rebar and buried under the rubble of a burning building, and wakes up and has no questions of how he is alive!  ",45cn7c
czz8n0l,"There was a montage of scenes with him throwing himself off a building, crashing into a wall on a motorcycle, crushing himself with a car, etc, to try to kill himself in the original script.  Sadly it never made it into the movie, as it was a really cool little scene that fleshed out that part of his character a little more.  I blame the budget.  

It was beyond great for what it had to work with though, just a shame that the budget kept it from being as great as it could have been.  The original final battle was MUCH more huge and epic than the one in the movie, but much more expensive to shoot too.  They included a nod to it with Deadpool forgetting all the guns he was going to use in the original ending, in Dopinder's cab.  ",45cn7c
d03k51o,"It's unlikely Fox will ever do F4 again with how badly it has bombed. Even if they got a good one up and running, there's so much scorn for the series that it's box office poison. 

Which means it's only a matter of time before the rights revert to Marvel. 

So we might get a Marvel-helmed F4 in Phase 4 or 5 if there's still money to be made in the superhero movie market. ",45cn7c
d0230e7,"That's totally fine.  But if my group decided to go see a movie I'd rather not see, I'd tell them I'd meet them after for drinks.  ""Spending time"" with people at movies is a weird duck.  You're not actively engaging with them until after and most times you end up just going your separate ways instead of having a few drinks and discussing the movie.  I'd rather spend time with them being engaged at an activity.

Now if it's just my GF, yeah I'll go see whatever movie she wants.",45cn7c
d01k0z5,"Parent is fucking with you.  It was Cable.

Though there's no reason Wolverine couldn't also be in it; Fox has rights to him too obviously.",45cn7c
d02fqfm,"Well in the movie he's more than 6'6""",45cn7c
czzcbvu,but i mean that was A hellicarrier. i mean you cant say it wasnt even if it was in a different universe. ,45cn7c
czzdt83,McAvoy/Stewart *is* from that Universe.,45cn7c
czxzjvm,"Maybe those women just don't like action movies and there's nothing a studio can do to grab them. I'm a woman who's a HUGE fan of Deadpool (snagged screening tickets to see it with the man last Monday) and plenty of my female nerd friends went. But you couldn't get me to go see either a romantic comedy or dramatic character study if you paid me because that's just not the type of movie I like. Gender has nothing to do with it, it's all personal preference. ",45cn7c
czy14x7,"Yeah, I mean I'm a girl (although I'm a super nerdy girl) as are a large portion of my friends, and we were all really pumped for this but we all also already love that sort of movie ",45cn7c
czy2nfj,">Did you ever stop to think that if you're looking for ~~ground breaking~~ halfway decent character development, deadpool isn't your best bet?

I hadn't, actually. Since plenty of other superhero movies have done a better job, and all that. Since this was R-rated and ostensibly not pandering to pre-teens. Etc.",45cn7c
czz8szh,Yeah very true.  ,45cn7c
d00bi53,That actually would've been great.,45cn7c
d0ynnbi,Not everything needs shown I mean it's kind of implied time was passing by the montage of him killing ajaxs men one by one and the evolution of his suit and shit.,45cn7c
d01suga,"Hmm, that is a good point.",45cn7c
czz49ci,You should probably avoid using sarcasm in the future. You're not good at it. You *might* not even know what it is.,45cn7c
czxt92l,Pedophiles arent allowed near schools in a lot of places.  Calling him Jared was another way of calling him a pedophile.,45cn7c

czwz8vh,A deuce.  Drop 'em!,45cn7c
czxo5zm,"What did he see though? I agree with the poster that (aside from his skin, which was totally not healing) there were no indications of Wade having a healing factor until after their fight.",45cn7c
czxo42l,"He says that, but his cancer was never visible from the outside in the first place. He looked like just as much of a ripped Adonis with cancer as he normally does.",45cn7c
d0b3nef,"Its funny to me because there absolutely no reasoning to multiply. If anything the obvious thing would be to add or do 4^4. I dont know why, its all nonsensical anyways but its the most absurd and stupid psudo math joke I've seen in a film.

And it's not even 4 walls it 's 1 wall haha",45cn7c
czx77fd,"No it's not you know nothing, no names, you don't know him in person or what he does for a living. You just seem project your own problems onto random people.

Maybe the dad isn't an idiot and the child knew exactly what Deadpool is about? Maybe, maybe not, we don't know and we never will. 8 years was old enough vor Alien or Terminator...

But it's so easy to judge a person based on nothing.",45cn7c
czxqjyo,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFIxLCJifw

czzvxl9,For an R-rated movie?,45cn7c

d009jl3,"I think the movie was pretty funny, but ""absolutely hilarious"".

I mean, in my theater, there were some audible laughs, but nothing like some movies I've seen.

Most of the humor was targeted at 18 year old boys, by the 6th joke about balls/scrotum I was like, alright we get it, new topic please.

It was basically a normal super safe avengers/marvel movie, but they replaced the PG-13 implied sexual references with overt sexual references.",45cn7c
d00an99,"The best way to build up a villain is for him to do bad things, not bad thing. 

The build up of tension between them because Wade figured out his name was good. The actual torture...eh...it was far more interesting to watch him fight than watch him sit there and take insane about of brutality under the guise of kick starting mutant genes. 

Out of everything in that film, those moments didn't fit very well. If I were to watch this movie again, I'd skip right over those moments. ",45cn7c
d00akpg,"That would have been far more interesting to see him in a psych ward. 

Torture scenes are lost on me, now. Agent Carter had the best torture scene. No need to harm the person, just give them a ""deadly"" disease and tell them if they don't tell you what you need (to get the cure) then they'll be dead in 20 minutes...you'll be back in ten. ",45cn7c

d03carv,"Man Cabin was phenomenal. First time I had been multiple tricked in a film, in YEARS. Very similar. If that's your world, you got a lot of the inside jokes inside the basement when they were picking the ""evil"", right? It's like that with DP and Marvel stuff....  my friend who hates superhero crap loved DP because it made fun of all the stuff he hates.... so DP was accessible by people who love Marvel, and people who also hate it....",45cn7c

czzxv8m,I know.  Don't invade mine.,45cn7c
czz4lh6,True. ,45cn7c
czzzrun,"That was worded much better. I agree that it's stupid for groups to want to do away with the damsel in distress, but i dont think the trope is in danger. Whether it's Deadpool saving his girl, Finn saving Rey, or any gender combination of rescuers and rescued. We most commonly see men saving women, and i dont think that's a bad thing. However, seeing the opposite is an interesting change of pace. I just hate for this to happen for the sake of being able to play the ""girl power"" card in marketing. 

I also feel that we cant really comment on Rey's character traits until the end of the trilogy. She'll more than likely have some personal flaws to overcome on her hero's journey. Further, she is not the only character with a ""perfect"" personality. Poe is openly welcoming to a former enemy and seems like a golden boy throughout. I'd agree with your dislike of Rey for being one dimensional if she were the only character like that; Poe being the same way ruins that for me. But hey, for all i know, you dont like Poe either. 

Anyway, glad we could discusd this. When i say neckbeard i basically use it as the opposite of an SJW. And even though SJWs dont have to be on the extreme side, people most commonly use the term to describe the extreme ones. I didnt really think you were fat with a hairy neck.  ",45cn7c

When i commuted long distances for work by train in the 1990s (2 hrs each way) i would often get sick, possibly a result of the train ride and it wouldnt manifest til i got to work. So i would get sent home from work sick sometime before lunchtime (public facing work it was).

The last thing i wanted then was a 2 hour train ride, so i'd get of the train 2 stops away from work in the CBD and go to the cinemas. Cool, dark, nearly no interpersonal interaction, perfect.   

Now, i find a solo cinema trip to be the perfect mental, physical and emotional recharge. 

Doesn't mean i don't like to go to the cinema with people also, but going alone is also very nice.  

While it is not ""peace and quiet"" insofar as a movie can be loud and flashy... it is peace and quiet insofar as it is around two hours of pure ""no distraction, no worries"".

Watching a movie at home, unless it's way too late at night (in which case volume is then often an issue), is always interrupted by kids or other such things.

czybvvz,"I take an issue that a lot of Kelly's characterization of Deadpool in the film is used sparingly; it briefly comes and goes depending on what a particular scene or sequence in the film requires of the character. In the more intimate and heartfelt parts, it shines and elevates the character; such as Wade returning to Blind Al's place after losing his hand and the few scenes the two share afterwards, or even the brief moments Wade shares with Weasel in the bar.

But when the script requires a more 'frenetic' Deadpool, the film slips into tinges of Way's run. There's clear tonal dissonance at these times; one moment Tim Miller's Buster Keaton-esque visual gags of abusing Wade's super regen, Deadpool's quips, and references seem natural, and at other moments, everything seems pandering as the film strangles the R-rating for maximum profit.

As for the irredeemable asshole bit, you might be right. It might require another viewing before I can better appreciate what is being done with Wade in film. But as it is, I'm relatively disheartened over the whole reliance on pedestrian humor. If they retain Kelly's iteration of Deadpool completely for the sequel, it might blow me away.

It's like I said in my original post, there was a lot of potential here. Not only in crafting a unique superhero film, but in doing something different even compared to the comic books. Embrace Joe Kelly's Deadpool fully. Utilize Blind Al, Weasel, Vanessa and the other supporting characters to their full potential. Balance out the humor. And I agree with you that this is a relatively accurate translation of Deadpool from paper to film compared to *most* iterations of the character, but it can be better, more accurate. There is always room for improvement.",45cn7c
czx2vt8,"> Yet in your OP you took out many parts that made it the film that it is (such as the performance of the actor who portrayed Deadpool).

Even my thoughts on the film [3 days ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/moviescirclejerk/comments/44vffk/uj_so_i_watched_deadpool_uj/) praised the humor and Reynolds' performance. Like I said; you clearly can't seem to wrap your head around what I'm saying.

> You can't seem to wrap your head around the fact that this wasn't supposed to be some fantastic pinnacle of cinema.

Considering how most of the circlejerking has placed the film on a pedestal above all the other superhero films just because of it's R-rating, whilst claiming it's a ""breath of fresh air"", I don't see anything wrong with challenging the prevalent nerd sentiment that *Deadpool* is some kind of unique cinematic revelation.

Things happen, and Al and Wade have to make like they're Pete and Aunt May while they decide how to get home.

Best thing about the issue is that it's taken a Spider-Man book from the 60's and thrown Deadpool pretending to be Peter into the mix. The way he interacts with comic book characters speaking that 60's comic book talk is hilarious.

If you have a trash can outside of every theater (a very common practice), and people are expected to take their trash to those trash cans, like civilized people, the only thing that employees have to do is sweep. This is much much faster than sweeping AND also spending time to walk the rows and pick up all of the trash left behind. The quicker a movie can be cleaned, the quicker managers can schedule the next showing to start after it. This also means that it will be quicker to get the people waiting for the next showing in the theater so they're not overcrowding the lobby. Ultimately, this results in 1) more movies scheduled which means more ticket sales and concession revenue for the cinema and 2) less overcrowding in the lobby so the customers have a better experience.

On a side note, I kind of get why they didn't include Deadpool struggling with the idea of killing Ajax ala Kelly's run in the movie. I think in a movie context, that might have come off as a tad derivative as the ""superheroes don't kill"" trope has become a bit cliche over the years. I think it was a good idea to throw that particular arc to the side for the time being. For an introductory movie, I think establishing such a gleefully amoral character in a superhero movie was a good idea. Now that Deadpool's violent streak has been established, now I think in a sequel it would be a good idea to subvert that again and have him struggle with his morals more. 

On another positive note, I will say that what I was worried about - and something A LOT of Deadpool comics do - is that they would make him goofy and incompetent. It's something that so many Deadpool books too. Since he's crazy and humorous, automatically he has to be a useless, bumbling clown. Thankfully, probably my favorite aspect of the film was that Wade was hyper competent, scarily efficient and damn near unstoppable (even if his healing factor was significantly toned down for the better).

",45cn7c
czxugd8,">Because those were the only good parts of the film

Exactly. **Those** are where the quality is in this movie. That is what it set out to do. By taking those out of the equation and then shitting on it is silly. 

>Notice how I then brought up everything I believed were negatives in the next paragraph after removing the R-rating and Reynolds' performance?

Very astute of you and get this, *I did* notice that other paragraph full of words. Your criticism's, although not wrong, are hardly a surprise. This is an *origin* story, so the focus being on Deadpool rather than the supporting characters isn't surprising. Jumping to the conclusion of Colossus just killing himself because he'll have nothing to do for the subsequent sequels is a leap that has no logical consistency. Maybe let Deadpool develop in his origin story and see where the next movie takes the supporting characters? Along this line as well, did you expect this to me some tense, well done revenge story like Blue Ruin or something? I just don't understand criticizing it for being a generic revenge story, when the trailers pretty much said it was going to be a generic revenge story. 

>I don't see anything wrong with challenging the prevalent nerd sentiment that Deadpool is some kind of unique cinematic revelation.

Where has some said this was a cinematic revelation? It sounds to me like you're creating an argument against something that doesn't exist. Almost all the reviews for the movie have just said it was a super fun and entertaining movie. No one is claiming it's cinematically marvelous, it's just fucking fun *because* of the liberties they had with an R-rating and the outstanding performance from Reynolds. 

>Like I've said three times now; you can't seem to wrap your head around what I'm saying. 

No, I know exactly what you're saying. Your trying to be some enlightened critic who claims it's a bad movie because of its generic structure, sans the comedic elements. I'm not saying you're wrong, but your argument is largely irrelevant because no one is claiming it's some type of Superhero genre changing movie. The comments about it being a breath of fresh air amongst the superhero movie spectacle are because it pokes fun at superhero movies, actually shows visceral violence, and could use crude, foul jokes. That hasn't been the case in any superhero movie as of recent, so *it is* a breath of fresh air. 

>I've come to accept how some people (on Reddit) can't compute the more critical facet of looking at films

Yeah, this holier than thou attitude you're giving off makes perfect sense. I'll leave you with this: who the fuck is trying to look at this movie critically? I mean really? There are some movies that deserve to be looked at critically like Ex-Machina and then there are those that absolutely do not need to be looked at critically because the movie was made *solely* for entertainment and fun. If you want to look at *Deadpool* critically, go ahead. You're absolutely not wrong in your analysis, but it's an analysis that no one is really looking for. If you look at *Deadpool* as a sum of its parts, which include its R-rating and Reynolds performance, you get a very entertaining movie that is fun to just sit down and watch. Not look into critically or anything more than surface level because it makes no attempt to be that type of movie. 

Again, you're not wrong man. It is a generic revenge movie that didn't really do anything crazy with its plot. What I'm saying is, trying to remove the quality parts of the movie and look at it the way you're doing is dumb. Its a fucking Deadpool movie. It did exactly what it was trying to do and that was be a fun movie. Not technically incredible, just fun. ",45cn7c

d025vqm,No they did an exchange. The one he bought online for king fu panda. The guy at the window didn't really care. It was the girl in the window next to this that kept making a big deal out of it ,45cn7c
czx0amp,"I'm actually glad I had heard nothing about the end-credits scene, I had zero expectations. I thought it was pretty clever, but yes, underwhelming. However, this movie did not take itself seriously enough to have some epic reveal or some incredible cameo. It fit with the nature of Deadpool.",45cn7c

d0t2lqh,I've never heard of him. What's so bad about that?,45cn7c
czxdy9w,"But you could say that about anything. I mean, if you *only* saw this movie you wouldn't recognize Iron Man flying by in the background, doesn't mean they can use him.

Not arguing with you, by the way. I'm just genuinely curious as to how these rights issues work.",45cn7c
d02x68l,"See, the problem with saying that the humor was cringeworthy is where I draw problem with your statement. Go ahead and not like it, but the humor was not cringeworthy. The reason I have problem with it is because I like many consider Deadpool one of my favorite characters, and claiming a movie the majority of people loved is a cringefest you come off insulting to the majority. 

As you said, it is hard to nail every joke when you have to fill an hour and a half. However, as a hardcore fan, Deadpool has never been a real genius of comedy, and his character isn't meant for that. He has always been a constant stream of oneliners, and that is very hard to write for, but the movie did a serviceable job.

Calling it cringeworthy makes you look pretentious. The term cringeworthy is fucking idiotic and cringeworthy in itself. If a joke doesn't land for you but everyone else enjoys it, you come off as a dick by going ""You have to admit its cringeworthy!""

Which is why I said let it go.",45cn7c
d044ane,"Man how can you dislike Austin Powers? crazy lol

I dont really like straight up comedies. Superbad I love, can't think of any more off the top of my head. I like movies with a sense of humor in them but that doesnt have to be the main focus. Like Lebowski, Zombieland, idk, drawing a blank here.",45cn7c

czx6z50,"OK, it's not THE helicarrier. I agree. That would cause problems. 

But it was a ship that was clearly meant to fly. I am certain of that. 

In the same way he mentions SLJ in the post credit scene. Talking about the eyepatch and wearing leather. He doesn't say ""Fury"" and he doesn't say ""SHIELD""  but we all knew what he was talking about, right? Exactly the same thing. ",45cn7c
d51jutx,"You're confusing facts with insults again.  Needless to say, I apologize for not liking a movie with peepee, poopoo kaka and dooky jokes.  To each their own though. ",45cn7c
d00ed9b,"Okay, so I just finished watching it again for a second time, and it turns out it was a helicarrier. There was even a sign at the back saying watch out for propelors. ",45cn7c
czz56yj,"Yeah. I know who runs the properties. If Marvel/Disney can make a deal for Spiderman with Sony it is not impossible for Fox to make a deal with Marvel/Disney. It is unlikely now with the success of the movie sadly. But there is nothing in the comic books that prevents it. In Avengers #0 for instance, Deadpool becomes an offical Avenger.",45cn7c
d008krr,"Idk, capt isn't in the deadpool movie universe since they don't exist in the xmen universe which deadpool is in.

I would love for them to settle the legal disputes like they did with Spiderman so we can get one huge universe.

Just imagine dead pool strolling into the new capt America movie and saying ""wait, I'm not allowed to exist here."" Then whistles out of frame.",45cn7c
czy7ibz,"In other words. It's like sending Michelin to review a McDonalds. 

What exactly are you expecting to find?",45cn7c
d0gav0v,"The whole genre of movies and everything in them is tacitly subjective. To dismiss criticism and just say 'well some people liked it so it must have worked' is a bit ridiculous. Even if people laughed, Deadpool isn't a well made comedy or superhero movie as its very lazy and just relies on the over saturated one liners to carry it, which is my subjective opinion.",45cn7c
d05v4kj,"Of course he did, the 4th wall breaks weren't clever - they were just fourth wall breaks for the sake of fourth wall breaks.",45cn7c
d025dej,"So unless I am ALREADY very into the movie I'm seeing, I am not allowed to share my opinions or feelings? I enjoy critiquing movies... but I'm only allowed to do that if I go into it already loving it and the character and the plot?

I see PLENTY of people here commenting that they knew nothing about Deadpool going in, and/or don't like superhero movies, or just went with friends. So go bother those people as well. The only reason you keep arguing with me that my opinion doesn't matter is because you don't agree with how I feel. If I were to say ""I don't like superhero movies but LOVED this"" you'd have left it alone.

And just so you understand, saying ""I am NOT MUCH of a fan of ___"" doesn't mean I don't like them. I even said ""I enjoy some"". Sorry it offends you so much to hear someone doesn't love Deadpool as much as you do I guess?",45cn7c

czxyo0a,Ajax German suplex ,45cn7c
d00ius0,"Yeah, it was pretty much like browsing reddit. You see a couple of memes, a joke or two, you are having fun, you give some upvotes maybe, but at the end of the day you realize it was nothing special. Just two hours of pretty shallow fun. ",45cn7c
d00mnq1,"Yeah, that is my point. You have to do research. The movie doesn't speak for itself because it's part of an interconnected series. The MCU is like a huge TV show where you can't just watch certain episodes because you will be lost.",45cn7c
czzz0ov,"About a decade older.  It was the exact type of comedy I found funny when I was 18, with some unexpected stuff thrown in.  Not blaming the younger crowd for finding it funny, I've just been jaded by it by now.  
",45cn7c
czzuxbh,"But it had no weight. He didn't say why it wasn't funny, he probably has no idea who Deadpool was before the movie, and if he did he would realize that is EXACTLY how Deadpool does his humor. With that said, even if you didn't find it funny, the movie was spot-ON to the character of Deadpool and that deserves more credit than just saying ""Wasn't funny, two thumbs down.""",45cn7c
czzzord,I didn't start the thread dip shit. Captain Karma Hero did.,45cn7c
czyo38o,"I would definitely be accepting of the vitals explanation except that cancer really isn't something that shows up on vitals: Temperature, Heart Rate, Respiration Rate, Blood Pressure, Cancer?

Ajax makes an overt remark that they have no way of knowing what sort of mutation will occur or when (if ever) it will occur when he explains that ""if you have any mutant genes adrenaline will activate them."" He isn't even sure if the genes are present, much less what they'll do if they are.

I think this was a slight oversight, a choice made to make sure the audience knew ""okay from this point forward he can heal"" so they wouldn't be unsure what was going on when he survives an explosion, being speared on rebar, and a fire. It's a comic book movie so I don't fault them for it.",45cn7c

czy7vs9,Exact same thing happened to me. Just gives me more of a reason to buy the BluRay when it comes out.,45cn7c

d0484d3,"I mean I guess, but he's not not going to be in future Marvel movies either.",45cn7c

czxtaoa,Maybe the think they were trying to do was to announce the next movie?,45cn7c
czyqv5x,In the US. UK theatres must be operating very inefficiently.,45cn7c
d2ulmas,Cuz youre in /r/movies?,45cn7c
czxpvzl,Oh. I have no idea. I would think you are able to have creative licence with things. ,45cn7c
d02xdg8,"nooo no no, I didnt say you had to admit it was cringeworthy, I said you either have to make the distinction between clever humor and cheesy humor if we're gonna argue this. If you're gonna say you enjoy Deadpool's humor because it is cheesy (or admit that he's not very funny like you just did), then that's perfectly fine. I can appreciate some corny/cheesy humor when it's intentional/exaggerated, but in Deadpool's case it definitely wasn't.

But if you want to argue that it was clever, or that any of the jokes were well executed, well, to me thats just something I wanna get into and understand.
 
And I don't think finding something to be cringeworthy is pretentious. The dialogue just made me cringe, like how *nails* on a chalkboard makes other people cringe, and others find 'the Office' to be unbearably cringeworthy.  I'm not putting you down for enjoying it. i just want to understand why you do.

d0gb8r1,"I think there are lot of genres that lend themselves to deconstruction much better than comedy does. I think you can read enough books to be a decent filmmaker, however, I do not think you can read enough books, then get on a stage and do stand up. I think comedy is not nearly as easy to deconstruct, with comments such as ""jokes should be structured like this and should follow rules x and y."" With a drama, there are a lot of elements that make it a significant, good drama, but with comedy, I honestly think the best measure is whether or not you laughed.",45cn7c

It doesn't offend me.  I'm actually really interesting in people's opinions who AREN'T huge comic book fans.  There's nothing to talk about with people who already like it.  We just nod and say, ""Yeah, that was cool"" and move on.",45cn7c

d00olyr,"It does though. You don't have to do that research. Knowing how captain america met widow or why he is in sheild doesn't forward the plot. Its interesting to know, but its not essential.  Take a war movie, Fury, say. You don't know what prompted any of the main characters to join army, or how they first met, but it is still a self contained story. It might be interesting to know some of their background stuff. But not necessary.",45cn7c
