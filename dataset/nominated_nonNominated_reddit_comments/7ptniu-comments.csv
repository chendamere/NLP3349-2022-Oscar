dsjyk2j,"Probably the most wholesome movie I’ve seen in a long long time. Thought the whole film was perfect overall, but the visuals to me stood out so much. Loved the different sequences like Aunt Lucy touring through the pop up book and the prison turning luxurious. 10/10",7ptniu
dsjzs8g,"It's a shame that every time I tell someone that I really enjoyed the first Paddington I get a confused reaction of ""what that movie is actually good? Yeah, ok."" And now I just got out of the second one and they somehow one-upped it and made quite frankly a perfect charming family film that is honestly leagues above the rest. 

This film is just so heartwarming and smart in both its humor but the way in executes it while also incorporating its themes. The whole cast knocks it out of the park and Hugh Grant is having the time of his life in this villainous role. He charms the hell out of it. 

It seems like many are willing to just assume this is another ""stupid kids movie"" but please go and support some genuinely great entertainment that's right for viewers of all ages.",7ptniu
dsk9ii2,"I really liked the first Paddington quite a bit, so I'm floored that I enjoyed this one even more. What's not to love, the movie has so much charm. Did anyone else think it was pretty dark when [Paddington accepted his potential death underwater?](#spoiler)",7ptniu
dsjyk5j,"The first Paddington film along with it's sequel are rare examples of a Live-Action adaptation of a beloved children's character done right. I wish the same could be said for the upcoming Peter Rabbit film by Sony. 

Hell, I wish the same studio (StudioCanal) that made the Paddington films would have gotten their hands on doing a Live-Action Peter Rabbit film that was as faithful and cute as this before Sony gotten hold of it. It's such a missed opportunity considering how beautiful and good the characters are drawn especially in Watercolor. Especially since Peter Rabbit is one of my childhood icons.

 Edit: Turns out it was Framestore and not Studiocanal that did the Paddington films.",7ptniu
dsk3pv3,"Incredible movie. The writing is insanely tight, I couldn't believe how many setups and callbacks there were and how well the entire movie folded together. Hugh Bonneville and Hugh Grant both turned in top notch performances in this film, and the rest of the cast was really solid too. Some of the scenes were absolutely gorgeous to look at, and the whole thing just really captured a wonderful spirit.

I can't remember the last time a movie made me laugh and cry quite as hard as this did. To anyone who dismisses this as ""just a kid's movie"" I implore you to check it out. If you look for the good in this film, you'll find it. ",7ptniu
dsk2euq,"This was like ""The Shape of Water"", but for kids.",7ptniu
dsjz4cf,"I love the original so much, and this was even better. The direction, the visuals, the humor, Hugh Grant...it was all so perfect. And Paddington's beautiful spirit of decency and thoughtfulness resonated strongly through the whole thing. 

I knew exactly where the ending was going a couple of minutes before it got there but I still had to fight like hell to hold back tears. ",7ptniu
dsk638i,"Once again, hilarious and heartfelt, I might even prefer it to the first film honestly. The prison sequences reminded me a lot of The Grand Budapest Hotel in a very good way, with a downright hilarious performance by Brendan Gleeson as that big ol' hardened softie at his core Knuckles (seriously the man is a treasure - never had a bad performance in anything). 

Set design was some of the best of the year; love it when kids films don't slum on the technical elements. Costumes great too,  especially Hugh Grant's ever more ridiculous array of thespian garments. 

I think above all though one has to love these films for imbuding such a earnestness and joy to its humour and emotional beats. You really grow to care for ol' Paddington and the Browns in the way I fear the upcoming adaptation of Peter Rabbit will forget to do.

9/10.",7ptniu

dsk1il9,"It's rare to watch a film where everybody involved is clearly having a fantastic time, with so much love going into everything on screen, and, better yet, the end product is of extremely high quality. Take everything that you hate about how film studios handle much-loved material as they translate it from cartoon or book to film; how they handle sequels/reboots or live-action adaptations, and Paddington 2 is the perfect, polar opposite of that.

It's funny, charming, colourful; it displays great changes in tempo, memorable characters and an emotionally rewarding story. I was taken aback at times by how good the film was to look at, almost prettier than it has any right to be. Someone in this thread used the word ""wholesome"" and that's absolutely spot on. Cannot recommend it enough.",7ptniu

dskgtc5,"Haven’t felt like that leaving a family film in a long time. Hysterical yet moving and beautifully told. A true delight. Just wish people would take me seriously when I tell them “Paddington 2 is a masterpiece” it does sound like a joke, but it’s the truth. ",7ptniu
dsk23bx,"This was one of the cutest movies I've seen in a long time. I especially liked the little details i.e. Knuckle's sandwiches, and the paper he was reading in prison was called ""The Hard Times""

Fun fact: The original stuffed Paddington bear was invented by Jeremy Clarkson's mother, which Jeremy still has.",7ptniu
dskbl3j,"Man was this movie good. I expected another light hearted movie but got so much more. It made me laugh, happy, sad, and then gave me tears of joy. That single “Happy Birthday Aunt Lucy” and then hug scene made me tear up. I thought I’d never cry of happiness! 100% is what this movie we’ll deserves! I recommend it for everyone to watch.",7ptniu
dss8mf3,"The release of *Paddington 2* is a bigger deal to me than the next installment of Star Wars or Marvel or what have you. Even though I am a grown man, *Paddington* is my favorite movie. I was cautious about spoilers for months and wore my duffle coat to an late night showing the night before release day in the US. I am happy to report that I loved *Paddington 2* even with all that anticipation. 

*Paddington 2* continues the same standard of excellence set by its predecessor for rich visuals, character animation, and clever wit.  Generally speaking, the movie is a colorful feast for the eyes with neat uses of animation and effects throughout. The pop-up sequence in the beginning is marvelous. There is broad and subtle humor in abundance, and it is evident that filmmakers have mastery of both. Rather than go through every gag I liked, suffice it to say that every joke landed for me; there is just so much good comic material. Some highlights that immediately come to mind are the marmalade making scene, Paddington's mishap in the barbershop, and the hilarious mid-credits musical number.

I continue to be impressed by how well Paddington is animated. The character animators succeeded yet again at making Paddington cute, funny, and sympathetic. For that matter, all of the bears are well animated and seamlessly composited into the live action footage. Once again Ben Whishaw is perfect as Paddington's voice. He was a great find back when Colin Firth dropped out of the first movie. Whishaw is so good it feels like should have been in that role from the get-go; I can't imagine a better voice for Paddington. High marks also for the other actors, especially Hugh Grant who expertly walks that line between menace and comedy just like Nicole Kidman did in the first one.

This sequel is even more of a tearjerker than the first movie. I sobbed during Paddington's arrival at prison and the silent underwater goodbye between Mrs. Brown and Paddington when they briefly resign themselves to his fate before reinforcements arrive to help rescue him in the nick of time. A few other scenes also made me tear up. With all the comedy and the melancholy, it is quite the emotional roller coaster, in a good way. 

Of course, I got all choked up again for the ending, but those were happy tears. What a perfect ending it is. I thought it was a good choice to end the film right there on a tender note rather than trying to tack on an additional peppy scene.

And finally, the music. The soundtrack has already taken up residence in my regular listening rotation where it is sure to stay, just like that of the first movie. The return of the diegetic calypso band was not unexpected but certainly welcome, with a new set of tunes I thoroughly enjoyed.

Now there are two movies I call my favorite, and they both star a darling little bear from Darkest Peru. *Paddington 2* is as good a sequel as I could have asked for. Heartwarming, wholesome fun. Just perfect. 10 jars of marmalade out of 10.",7ptniu

It's heartwarming from beginning to end, has a great ensemble cast, creative cinematography and achieves that difficult task of being better than the first film.



There's a scene near the start where Paddington is looking through the pop-up book of London, then the camera descends into the street filled with characters drawn like the original illustrated books and he imagines walking among them and reuniting with aunt Lucy. It's incredibly beautiful. ",7ptniu

If more people were like Paddington Bear the world would be a better place :')",7ptniu

Paddington 2 is fantastic. Brilliant acting all round (Particularly from Brendan Gleeson and Hugh Grant), brilliant animation, genuinely funny and a great message that carries throughout the film. 

The ending brought a tear to my eye. ",7ptniu
dslczas,"The Paddington movies just make me feel good about humanity. I don't cry in movies much at all, but the end of this film forced a tear out of me.

dsl7ok9,"A kid behind me in the theater wouldn’t sit in his seat and told his mom “This movie is horrible!” 

I sat there stunned.  Was he right? Was this movie horrible?  Was I blinded by Nostalgia?  I collapsed in my seat. The room felt hot and I began to convulse. Everything I ever knew was a lie.  Then, I had a realization. 

Fuck that kid.  This was the best goddamn movie I’ve seen in years. It was absolutely fucking delightful and that little uncultured fuck needs to sit the hell down. I stood up in my seat and turned around. 

I yelled “Oh this movie is horrible?  I’d love to know why.  The narrative may have seemed simple at first, but it quickly turned into an intricate plot and took some risks I never thought a family movie would. The color grading was to die for.  The cinematography has never been so careful in a kids movie before. A lot of work went into every scene- no every shot- and I guess it was all a waste because you think it’s horrible.  Sit the hell down and let me enjoy my goddamn bear movie.”

The kid had tears welling in his eyes. His mother said nothing because she knew I was right and was trying to work up the courage to say the same thing to him. The theater erupted into cheers and I said “Now, now, let’s enjoy the cinema.”

The boy stayed in his seat the rest of the movie. 

Really good film, 10/10. ",7ptniu

WHY DID HE EVEN GET SENT TO JAIL? In America, someone has to press charges in a robbery situation to be sent to jail. The shop owner himself testified that Paddington wouldn't be the type to break in and he liked him as a friend, so did he still press charges to get him in put in jail, or do the police have the ability to arrest/incarcerate people regardless of what the ""victim"" says? >.> ",7ptniu

dt5ttbt,"This is an utter delight of a film. Paul King brings so much visual style to the film as he did the original. His quaint and fantastical style is heavily inspired by Wes Anderson and it constantly elevates the material. Whishaw is perfect as Paddington and perfectly embodies the character's warmth and innocence. King and Simon Farnaby's script is witty and emotionally rich, with the ending making hitting me hard on an emotional level. https://iwandm.wordpress.com/2018/01/24/paddington-2-review/",7ptniu

dsk17l0,"Just jumping in here to say I saw this last year on opening weekend in Ireland, just before emigrating to the US, and I was smiling so hard throughout the entire film that I just started crying out of nowhere and then when the actual emotional climax came I literally wept.

This movie made me so happy that it actually broke my heart. Kermode and Mayo talked about how leaving it, you will have a slight spring to your step and think the world a better place. Well that happened to me and made me so sad that I was saying goodbye to home but so happy that I had family and friends who loved me and whom I loved in return, who wanted me to succeed and be happy.

This film might genuinely be one of my favourite movies off all time. It's just so, so beautiful and charming and sweet and funny and it really picked me up when I needed it.

And I didn't even like the first one.

Go see it. If you're feeling at all down or just jaded or cynical, go see this movie. It's absolutely wonderful what this movie will do for your spirit.",7ptniu

dsqhb8u,"My favorite film of last year without a shadow of a doubt. It is a relative masterpiece. Technically stunning. Shot beautifully. Superb acting (Huge Grant especially) and one of the nicest most simple plots in modern cinema. I urge everyone to watch this movie (and the first) as it will make you feel like a kid again. I was also crying my eyes out at the end because it ended perfectly!

Only negative [when Paddington was locked in the train car as it sinks...that was a little harrowing given the nature of the film](#spoiler)",7ptniu
dst44lh,"I really enjoyed Paddington 2! My boyfriend and I saw the trailer for it before we saw Murder On The Orient Express and I thought it looked good, but we hadn't seen the first one - but it's on Netflix! So we watched the first one a couple of weeks ago and loved it, so we knew we'd have to see Paddington 2. I love how beautifully shot the film is and the plot was quite wonderful, almost better than the first one.

It was interesting though, as a 21 year old woman, to note how flat the reaction was from children in the cinema. I think the humour in these films just isn't directed at kids, as I don't recall there being any big laughs from the children around us. That's not necessarily a bad thing, and it's also interesting because since Paddington is such an old character I think there's a lot of appreciation for older generations who grew up with his books. But it was interesting to see a typically children's film to be not so... kid friendly? It's not that humour was inappropriate for kids, but more just the jokes were mature in a way that just can't break through to a kid. Hugh Grant's character, for example. I found him hilarious and wonderful, but none of the kids in the cinema really laughed at him. I suppose to him he was just pure evil, ha. But nonetheless, it's definitely not your typical kid's film, in my opinion.

I was recommending this film to all my mates at work, so hopefully some people take me up on it because I think it was delightful!",7ptniu

dsuvy4e,"It was fine but it had the same problem that Zootopia had: no kids in the theatre. Instead, there was this big ass group of people all dressed in bear costumes. We're talking high end stuff, a few guys even said they were wearing the official Country Bears costumes from the 2002 movie. It wasn't so bad... until Padding ton actually appeared on screen. They would release a terrifyingly loud moan and toss marmalade everywhere. They'd only do it if it was only him, not counting background characters. One scene in particular, can't remember which, got people really riled up and they were dumping it all over themselves. They were gentle though and were careful not to get any of that sweet, sticky nectar on my furless skin. When it was finished, they sang the ""bear song"" which was basically incoherent ""roaring"". When the credits finished they cried and I cried too. I've gained a large amount of respect for those people and their culture since that fateful night. Maybe one day our paths will cross again at the premier of Paddington 3, and hopefully, Country Bears 2: The Black Hose.

I thought they could have expanded on the mystery of Madame Kozlova's treasure a bit more, like explain how or why she hid her treasure. The driving force of the mystery was kind of sidetracked by Paddington's stay in the prison (which to be fair was probably the best part of the movie), and having the Browns discover the mystery after the fact felt a bit strained. I didn't like how Peter Capaldi's character Mr. Curry reverts back to his first movie attitude towards Paddington, especially since he had a bit of a character arc there which made it seem he would now (albeit begrudgingly) accept him.

dso7pkp,"Shaun the Sheep was another great film, had a lot of awkward situations like Paddington. There very little to any voice acting out it’s still a great film. 

Big Hero 6 is another good one, the first half of the movie is fantastic. It gets kinda less fun because they start to focus on other characters and it becomes almost an Avengers like theme but it’s still enjoyable. Can’t say there is a lot of films as happy and positive feeling as this Paddington. ",7ptniu
dsqj3ky,Ah ok sorry :),7ptniu
dukfe9d,"Yes. You are absolutely incorrect

The DA could still bring charges. They are just choosing not to because they feel the “victim” by saying not to press charges is going to make the case harder to win at trial.  It has nothing to do with that person pressing charges or not. Private citizens cannot bring charges whatsoever so you are misinformed. They may make you think thats what happening, but that is in fact false. In the same manner, that person could say “i want to press charges” and the DA can say no, and there’s really nothing he can do. 

This is why in criminal cases, it’s not “victim vs robber” it is “state of CA, or the “people” vs robber. Or you see murder cases where the suspect seems obvious, but they refuse to indict. You see the victims family begging the authorities to arrest them, but theres nothing they can do because they cannot press charges themselves.",7ptniu
dsw17m6,"Yeah. I'm aware of very few (read:none) cases where someone has been able to bribe the victim in order not to get charged with crimes (though of course literal murder is the one exception, as dead people cannot be bribed).

Hanks gave a great performance. I really enjoyed watching him.
