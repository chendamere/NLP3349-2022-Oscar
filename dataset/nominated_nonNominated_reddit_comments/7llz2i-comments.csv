drnhcra,Theres a thread that pops up here every once in a while about what people think is the best acting in one scene in a movie. Sally Hawkins in the scene where she's begging Giles for his help to rescue the Asset. Where she's telling him to say what she signs. God damn so good. ,7llz2i

drnbh0b,"I seriously didn't think I would like Giles that much. I adore the close relationship he has with Elisa, and I really want to know how they first met. Man, did I cringe (in a good way) during that scene when he was talking to the pie guy. I felt *so* bad for him. 

I admit that I did like the little scene where Elisa basically tells Zelda that she had sex with the fish man because they could have easily gone to "" Oh god you had sex with him?! Eww! I can't look at you anymore"" angle. Instead, they basically had Zelda react as if  it wasn't *that* big of a deal, save for the whole "" Does he have a dick?"" part. Plus Zelda basically laughs like ""Wow Elisa I can't believe you had sex with him! You just went for it, huh? "". Weird for me to put into words, but it was nice that Zelda wasn't grossed out at Elisa? It just felt like a casual conversation between good friends.

I think one of my favorite scenes was at the end where Asset revives and stares down Strickland before killing him. Not because of Strickland getting killed, but because the Asset really looked ""like a god"", and it really felt like a ""You kidnapped me, tortured me, tried to kill me, and you killed *her*. How dare you."" vibe with his body language. Also props for the movie not making the Asset come back to life like it was a huge dramatic moment. IIRC, there was no music playing, and it was a nice touch to me. 

Not gonna lie, I stared at Strickland's hand each time it was on screen, and I did like how the fingers slowly changed colors over time due to it rotting. That said, I am kinda surprised that it didn't seem to affect his health with how black those fingers were near the end. I could have missed something, though.",7llz2i
drnlukr,"There were two I really loved about this film.

1. That poem at the end. So gorgeous.

2. There’s a moment that would usually be your typical passionate Oscar award speech when Elisa is telling Giles how desperate she is to save Fish Man, but that passion is only seen physically in her body, and on her face, due to Giles simply translating her movements sans passion. That was so intriguing to me.",7llz2i

drnwcsx,"I loved the scene where the monster escaped from the apartment and Elisa finds him alone in the cinema.   He was transfixed on the film playing,  which I believe was The Ten Commandments as there were slaves working on what appeared to be Egyptian monuments.  It struck me pretty powerfully because Elisa is this monster's Moses, breaking his chains,  hiding him from villainy,  and ultimately just trying to free him.  ",7llz2i

drnihij,"I'm really glad that Del Toro didn't go down the path where Elisa's voice gets magically cured- her character was just so perfect and although I was delighted by the solo song and dance sequence, I was worried that he'd undermine his own message by ""fixing"" her. And then I remembered it's Del Toro and I was just glad he gave us at least not horribly depressing ending!",7llz2i

drnl2da,"The editing on this movie was SO VELVETY SMOOTH. It was like butter. 

Sally Hawkins, have your Oscar nomination now (though I'm worried Meryl Streep is going to play spoiler to Sally & Frances McDormand's competition).

The Strickland peeing scene is maybe my favorite scene of the entire movie. Best laugh I had all year.

I really wanted to see the fishman's penis tho. *Disappointed*",7llz2i
drorxbr,"I'd like to talk about the ending. I personally believe that the ending may not be the ""true"" events (I am aware that this is a work of fiction) but are just Giles' mind fantasizing that they ""lived happily ever after"". This of course is a trick del Toro pulled in Pan's Labyrinth when [Ofelia sees her parents and the faun welcoming her back into the fantasy land but with the implication being that this may be just her seeing what she wants to see in her dying moments.](#spoiler)

I also found it interesting how just about everyone character in the movie has difficulty communicating with someone they're close to (Zelda can't emotionally connect with her husband, Giles can't communicate with the Pie guy, Strickland outright refuses to communicate with his wife), but Elisa and Sexually Thrilling Undersea Dude (S.T.U.D.) are able to communicate better than anyone else despite both lacking the ability to speak. I just thought that was interesting.",7llz2i
drn8tsf,"Giles is just such a delightful character: erudite, slightly crass, so genuine. I loved his excitement at concocting a plan with Elisa, felt such heartbreak for him with his failures in his love life, and such joy when he got his hair back. He was really the perfect supporting player. 

Great film, loved it even though I had a few issues with the third act (it seems weird that Hoffstetler would give Elisa and Zelda up if he knew he was going to die no matter what), and some of the writing was a bit on the nose.",7llz2i

Specifically a lot of emphasis being placed on the color green, so I just wanted to ask you guys; what did you think the color green actually meant in the context of the movie?

drncvfy,"Not my personal favorite of 2017, but in my opinion, this is the most perfect movie I've seen this year. I was entranced the entire time. It really feels like Guillermo del Toro's love letter to creature features, classic Hollywood romance, and cinema in general. The world he built was incredibly immersive and surreal, and literally every single performance was immaculate. I've seen and loved both Lady Bird and Three Billboards, but Hawkins deserves the Oscar. Stuhlbarg's triple-layered character is incredibly well-acted. He's a potentially sinister scientist--no wait, he's actually a Soviet spy--no wait, he's actually a decent person with a heart of gold. And he shuffled back and forth between these layers with complete ease. Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer play the greatest friends you could ever ask for, and Shannon is the perfect villain. And every single character gets a fleshed out backstory. I was amazed at how much story was told in just 2 hours. Not a single wasted scene. Okay, I feel like I'm ranting at this point. I need to see this movie again.

Oh and the creature itself. It was really incredible to look at. Doug Jones killed it too.",7llz2i

drnh4zv,"That scene where Elisa starts singing ""You'll Never Know"" and it transitions to them dancing in Black and White on a stage was so surprising and it's one of my favorite scenes in any film this year. Also when Elisa was convincing Giles to help her get The Creature out...goddamn if that doesn't win Sally Hawkins all the awards",7llz2i
drwbqfh,"I loved that the escape from the facility happened during the middle of the movie instead of being part of the climax. We get more time with the characters to see their relationship grow, and the more realistic (and they did a fantastic job of making it feel real) love story can set in. ",7llz2i
drnfmoa,"I think this goes without saying but it's a film for those who don't typically have a voice. A black women in the 50s, a closeted gay man , a Latin women who doesn't have the ability to speak and scientist . 

Those have the ability to speak are the ones who cannot communicate the best. The two characters that cannot talk communicate the best . 

It does all that and is a total genre bender that doesn't conform . I do think my favorite films don't have a specific genre but rather dip their toes into many in a great manner .

Shape of Water is something special that I am yet to even fully appreciate. Del Toro shows us his honest self as a filmmaker and it's beautiful. You just want to give that guy a hug . ",7llz2i

drn9588,"The film was beyond amazing, it has left me with a very lonely feeling ever since I left the theater last night, but in a bittersweet way. The music is nothing short of a masterpiece, I was actually reading that Desplat approached the score as “a musical for those without voices”. The music gives it an added layer that makes this movie an instant classic. Richard Jenkins stole the show for me, he was one of the saddest characters I’ve seen but also one of the most likable, I was extremely happy he was basically the third main character. His rejection at the diner followed by his speech he gives to Elisa while crying was crushing. Sally Hawkins has everyone in love with her for good reason, she’s fantastic and charming. My favorite visual was the Asset standing in the theater. Also Michael Stuhlbarg gives a story worthy of a stand-alone movie. When he says “Please, call me Dimitri” to the group, it spoke volumes, being comfortable enough to give away your biggest secret to strangers. Michael Shannon was menacing as fuck and I loved how he brought the god aspect to The Asset, his final line “so you really are God” was crazy, like that simple line has so much impact on the whole movie. And finally I think this is deserving of any oscar it’s nominated for. It’s perfect

also the way the music is timed at the very end was satisfying as hell, when the screen and music are fading out, and then the music swells exactly as the title comes up. I’m leaving out a lot of stuff, like I could talk about every single scene it’s just that good. Michael Shannon’s gangrene fingers were fucking disgusting though. I could’ve done without seeing him sniff them, then squeeze an ocean of pus out of them. And damn Elisa does some hardcore masturbating starting with the opening scene ",7llz2i

drnfpvc,"There was a lot that I truly loved in this film, but I had really hard time actually buying the romance. The Fishman really didn't come off as being intelligent on the same level as a human. We don't see it hold a conversation with Elisa, demonstrate any great emotional understanding, etc. It really felt like Elisa was just taking advantage of an animal. Maybe that was intended to be ""ambiguous"" but it didn't feel like the movie acknowledged the ambiguity in any way.",7llz2i
drnwxui,"Saw it at TIFF and the crowd went wild when Elisa and the creature were at the movie theatre because that’s the theatre that we were watching the movie in.

drn85rx,"I love how blatantly sexual this film is. First five minutes and Elisa is masturbating in the tub. Really set the stage for the kind of film Guillermo wanted to make and you are either on board or not.

To me the whole theme of this movie is taking sexuality versus sharing it; self versus selfless. Strickland just takes sexuality, his ideal woman is Elisa because she can’t talk while his dick is inside her, basically the ultimate form of selfish sexuality. Meanwhile Fishman at very least respects Elisa for herself, and cares for her on an emotional level.

I think this also relates to the way green pops up over and over, notably in comparison between Strickland’s lime candies and Giles’ fridge full of key lime pie. As Strickland notes he consumes the candies based on his own needs while Jenkins selflessly eats the pies despite them being apparently garbage because he’s seeking a bigger connection with the pie shop owner.

drn8bbc,"Seriously, if you don't cry when Elisa and the creature have a 1940s musical you are basically dead inside. It was so heartbreaking when she slowly went back to reality at the end of the number.",7llz2i
drsux2u,"Just saw the movie and it was really good!  The only other Del Toro movie I'm familiar with is Pacific Rim.  I always liked that movie due to how anime it felt and this movie also I believe has some anime inspiration that I'll get into later in this write up.

First and foremost, Sally Hawkins did a fantastic job as Elisa.  Her scene where she was pleading with Giles to save the fishman was so incredibly powerful and she did not speak a word during it.  This years lead actresses is stacked, I still haven't watched I tonya yet but between Saoirse Ronan in Lady Bird and Francis McDormand in Three billboards I believe Sally Hawkins had the superior performance.  Every actor and actress did a great job here, I can see Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins getting some award nods too.

If there was an award for best color design this movie would win it.  The pallet was consistent through out and knew when to include oranges for tense moments and reds for a variety of reasons such as the red Elisa wore that grew through out the film to describe the growing love between her and the fishman (she had a green headband first that changed to red, then red shoes, then at the end the red dress).  There were other uses of red too such as with blood mostly to draw the viewers attention (such as the fishmans trail) but also with other small details I'm not entirely sure of their meaning such as the red phone in Stricklands room (perhaps to represent danger?  I don't believe it'd make sense to represent love there as I don't recall him calling loved ones during work).  There was a clear contrast between the overall green/teal ""of the future"" against the reds.  Even with the jello changing it over to green because it was the ""in"" color.  

With the cadillac car I'm unsure exactly which model that was, but I believe the car included quite a bit of streamlining design which streamlining in industrial design, though the concept began in the 1930's, was a style that persisted through the 60's and conceptually was associated with prosperity and the future which was essentially what the car salesman described to Strickland.  Streamlining was a style included in all sorts of items and was essentially included to help sell stuff with the idea that the style was ""futuristic"".  That falsehood seemed to fool Strickland as he bought the car and bought into this idea of a futuristic and modern man/family being one that is materialistic.  I thought it also represented how Strickland's family on the exterior seems pretty and modern but is only that way from the outside.

What really struck me in this movie was the religious symbolism.  Strickland recounts the story of Samson who is historically believed by many to be like Jesus.  Symbolically, there are many depictions of Jesus as a fish and his followers as fishermen.  That is because in Greek icythus meant fish and was also the acronym for Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior.  To recognize other christians, the symbol of a fish or icythus was commonly used in the past during times of persecution .  The fishman in the movie is described as a god so I am pretty sure making him into a fish-like creature was intentional to draw comparisons between him and Christianity/Jesus.  However, in the movie I believe they briefly mentioned him being worshiped by aztecs which the aztecs also had a fish god, so perhaps the creature is simply a mix of various stories.  Elisa also lived above a theatre called Orpheum, a reference to Orpheus who was described as a fisher of men prior to the fish symbolism becoming connected to Christianity.  So it's also possible the fishman is a reference to Orpheus?  

There was also heavy water symbolism in this movie to.  In Christianity, water is heavily associated with fertility(as is fish) and rebirth.  In a way, that finale scene with Elisa and the fishman in the water was a sort of baptizing, as the characters are immersed in the water they encounter a sort of rebirth as Elisa is reborn into what she truly is, a fishwoman.

As for anime comparisons it is well known Del Toro is a huge fan of the work of Mamoru Oshii (director of Ghost in the Shell).  One of Oshii's lesser known works was the movie Angels Egg (a movie Del Toro has said in interviews he has seen).  In terms of religious symbolism I genuinely believe Del Toro got some inspiration from Angels Egg, especially in terms of the use of water specifically in the finale scene of shape of water but also the way christian symbols are depicted.  If you haven't seen angels egg yet I'd highly recommend it, quite an underrated movie.

Overall a great film that despite all the details I have been able to uncover I believe with a re watch I could uncover some more.",7llz2i
drn8aay,"The score and soundtrack really add to the air of romanticism, to the point where The Shape of Water felt like a classic musical. Alexander Desplat's score is whimsical and swells with love, along with some of the songs del Toro chose for the soundtrack. In particular, the dance sequence is an emotional high point thanks to the use of ""You'll Never Know,"" despite the absurdity of a woman dancing with a man-fish.

Guillermo del Toro's conscious attention to the movie's color palette makes The Shape of Water one of the most beautifully shot movies of the year. The palette predominantly green and aqua, as del Toro chose those colors to represent the land, sea, and their union when the relationship develops. 

Overall, The Shape of Water is among my favourite movies of the year and will be a serious Oscar contender.

Some side notes, this was one of the coolest screenings I've been to since the theater I was in was the same one below Elisa's apartment, so it felt rather surreal watching the theater I was in. Plus, Guillermo del Toro did a Q&A afterwards and he had a lot of interesting tidbits. He mentioned the significance of the use of color, how the creature was 95% practical, and how he was surprised he was able to pull the movie off on a $19 million budget. Another thing though, del Toro won't be recording a commentary for this since he believes the movie speaks for itself.",7llz2i

dvnvd4g,"I really liked how the main set of characters had some sort of problem with love. Elisa couldn't find love cause of her disability. Giles couldn't find it cause he was a gay man in the early 60s. Meanwhile, Zelda was married but unhappy cause her husband was useless and just dormant. 

Micheal Shannon was supposed to be the perfect man with the perfect family, but he always wanted more. Trying to get with Elisa, wanting another car, not really caring about his kids.    ",7llz2i
dv9ai01,"I liked the movie but I wasn't blown away by it. The acting, set design, and music we're all fantastic though. My big complaint is that the we get about 3 minutes of her and the fish man interacting in the facility. I thought it would have been neat to really dive into how someone could fall in love romantically with something that's not human. We get her giving him and egg, playing music, and a little montage. There was almost nothing to that part of the movie at all. We she is talking to Richard Jenkins and she says something similar to ""he sees me for who I am, and not the things I'm missing"" but we don't see anything meaningful like that happen between them. I really wanted the bulk of the film being her sneaking around and the two of them getting to know each other and learning from each other, but we get 3 minutes of that and a sex scene.

It's a good movie but I was hoping for me and I definitely plan on rewatching this one in the near future.",7llz2i
drnf7mq,"*Copying and pasting a review I've posted for this before*

Absolutely beautiful. That's all I can really say.

Guillermo del Toro really achieved something special here. You can tell how much love was put into this.

Kind of felt like an R rated disney movie.

Truly though it's a love story that pays homage to the horror movies of the past. Sally Hawkins was incredible, the whole supporting cast was great really, but Sally stole the show. You really believed she loved the fish monster. This is her story most of all it feels like, more than the monsters. I only wish we could spend a bit more time getting to know the monster a bit, and feeling that love he felt for her, as much as we feel the love she has for it.

Still. An amazing movie. Do yourself a favour and see this in theatres if you can. Unbelieveable.",7llz2i

Strickland is constantly eating GREEN candies.
Strickland at first calls the Cadillac he purchases GREEN, however he is corrected that it is TEAL, showing that he is against the way of the future.

dsurd4l,"I loved this movie. And one part is really tantalizing. The little speech that the five star general gave to Michael Shannon about how he would disappear if he failed was interesting. Something about a hole in the universe in the shape of him and he would go to an alternate universe of shit. He would be unborn, unmade and undone. I took this on two levels. One on the surface where he's just saying ""I'll end you"" and the other which is a high level operative in a top secret government facility housing who know what else supernatural assets. Maybe he wasn't being figurative. I liked that.

du84uc4,"I think someone could write a whole essay on the use of red and green and what their meaning in the film is.
My current theory is that green represents isolation/loneliness and red is love/ connections.

Examples: The creature is almost entirely green. It is represented as living alone all the time. A god in some circumstances. Gods are usually quite isolated. 

As the mute woman grows a connection to the creature she picks up more and more red. First her hairband, then lipstick, her heels, and finally her coat once they do the deed.

The neighbors work: he initially draws a red gelatin with a typical happy family around it. When he hands it in he is told that isn't what they are going for anymore (commentary on modern times?) and told to make the gelatin green and make the dad more 'happy'. Does this indicate that in our growing isolation in modern society we put on bigger and bigger smiles to cover it up like the dad? 

All the government cleaners and buildings, as well as most people homes are green. Does this indicate everyone is in jobs they don't like and lack a 'love' (red) for it? Hence mute girl wearing more red as she 'wants' to go see the creature? The micheal shannon character and the coworker lady both have unhappy home lives and their houses were very green (lacking in love). 

Mute girl and neighbors hallway is half green half red. They are great together and are probably the only source of love in each others lives (red), but they are also not the ones to fully fulfill each other. Neighbor guy cant have his romantic relationship and mute girl does not get the connection she desires as an incomplete person. 

Lastly, green and red are opposite colours that that really stand out from each other. Does it indicate that alot of the main characters also stand out or feel different in someway?

drn86z9,"I’ll just add I love how openly ambiguous the film is. It’s an adult fairy tell but del Toro is incredibly smart about leaving the film open to interpretation. He never makes it 100% clear if the creature is truly intelligent or just mimicking Elisa in order to get food and safety. The end especially is beautiful and ties in with Giles’ whole ideal, the happy Jello family. Ignore the violence and racism and sadness of reality, just eat Jello. It’s his gift and he gives it back to us the audience. Maybe Elisa was so desperate for love she fell in love with a wild beast that never loved her back and brought her into the ocean to die. But don’t you prefer the alternative? Isn’t that the story that you’d much rather be told?

dsy4xjm,"I was left with and intense feeling of emptiness by the end frases, the way he uses the word “believe” I have a strong filing that the end where her scars turn into gils, is nothing but the mere belief that Elisa might have being alive after the two shots. Belief means not being able to prove that something is a certain way and despite not being able to prove having faith it it... so perhaps they lived happily, but maybe they did not... and this is a possibility from how we see the use of fantasies around the movie, like the little dance and singing bit in the middle. That really left me thinking that it might be a tragedy in the end instead of  the happy ending we’d all like to have ... ",7llz2i
dtpn06o,"I loved Sally Hawkins performance. There's this certain presence and warmth she conveys from the films I've seen her in that's so intriguing to watch and she manages to do it here without saying a single word.  

I found the use of nudity and sexuality interesting. At first I thought I was getting quite a generous amount of Hawkins on display that I couldn't tell was necessary or not. However later I just thought to myself well the creature itself is by default naked, that's just it's natural state of being. So thus when she goes nude again I started to see it as her doing much the same.  

It was an enjoyable film. I was easily drawn in and sold on the concept despite its absurdness although a few side plots here and there added nothing to the film in my opinion. Pie guy and Strickland's wife told us a little more about Giles and Strickland's mentality and problems sure but nothing that wasn't already evident.  ",7llz2i
drn8876,"Seriously. Del Toro is like a modern day Aesop, or Hans Christian Andersen. I don’t think anyone crafts the fairy tale/fable type film nearly as well as he does. ",7llz2i
dv4fy1s,"I have a theory. Giles is an unreliable narrator. Maybe none of the characters existed except Giles and the bartender. Maybe none of the events happened except the scene where Giles is rejected.

Elisa's character is an expression of how it felt to be a gay man in the 50s. Elisa cannot speak. Giles also feels like he has no voice. He cannot express an important part of himself. He can't tell the bartender how he really feels.

The creature represents the bartender, or maybe just a relationship with another man. Something that the rest of the world would see as unnatural but perfectly natural to him. It is a mystery to her, but also alluring. Although the creature can't talk, she imagines that it must have feelings for her as well and tries to set it free.

The scene where she is sitting across the table from the creature and tries to tell it how much she cares (the song was ""You'll never know how much I care""), while the creature stares down at its food and seemingly doesn't hear, that also captures what it feels like to sit across from the man he is interested in.

Strickland is the overly masculine caricature of what a man is supposed to be. He mortally wounds Elisa, which is symbolic of Giles' rejection. But in the story that he would like to tell, the creature brings her back to life and they live together in their own world.

I posted a few days ago about how her character and her love interest in the creature didn't make any sense to me. In this light it would make a great deal of sense. Can anyone corroborate that?",7llz2i
drnnlky,"I petition that we refer to the asset by his deserved name, Egg. ",7llz2i
drpaitf,"This is hands down one of Sally Hawkins' best roles of her career and she never even says a word. We know how Hawkins sound like but just to see her flawlessly express her dialogue through sign language is magnificent. There is a scene where she’s acting her ass off as she expressly explains how she feels about The Asset and it really just gives give you chills because all of her dialogue is in sign language. For a long time, you’re so drawn to her performance that you believe that Hawkins is mute. In a MoMA Q&A I attended, del Toro revealed that he made Hawkins study silent film legends of the past including Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, and Charlie Chaplin to help get a sense of the character and how her performance should be. Well now knowing this kind of makes one convinced that Hawkins stayed up for weeks studying these films like it was a college assignment and it all paid off.

If all we’re going to get from now are on are R-rated films from del Toro, then I would want them to all feel like this where it is realistic and has a human theme within the realm of weirdness. Its as if del Toro saw “Beauty and the Beast” and literally said that his next film would be, “The Mute and the Missing Link Monster.” On the surface, this might be a strange story especially considering that there is an intimate scene between Elisa and The Asset (Don’t worry you don’t see any creature-human sex scene) but some way the romance between Elisa and the monster is believable. It earns your emotion for you to root for them the entire way through.

Director Guillermo del Toro does a brilliant job displaying characters motivations and fleshing them out at on a complex degree. Some of their arcs are done by the second act, and then some go on for a while, but it does progress the story and the urgency. The film has the visual beauty of ""Pan’s Labyrinth"" mixed in with ""Crimson Peak"" and the comedic tone of a ""Hellboy"" movie. While some of his past films were imbalanced with more thrills than a steady tone, this knows what it's trying to go for and excels at it. There is a balance with both the thrills, the humor, and the intensity. The story is predictable but the lengths it goes by having all of these likable characters helmed by a remarkable performance by Hawkins.

I didn't know much going into it besides having had seen the trailer. I liked that the movie took you to a whole new place for the 2 hours of it. I felt transported to their world and saw a glimpse of their lives. The pacing was spot on, and the acting was believable.

They prevail over the combined forces of the US government and the Russians. In that I found it uplifting and inspiring.

dud1wo9,"Brilliant.
Best scene has got to be when Elisa tells her friend Giles to repeat what she signs and really listen to her. She makes him and also myself understand and take her love for the Amphibian Man more seriously.

Also, from IMDB's trivia 

> Elisa was a left as a foundling baby by a river, is mute like the Amphibian Man, prefers to express her sexuality in water, and lives in a home with scale-print wallpaper. All these point to the fact that the marks on her neck were never scars, but are undeveloped gills, suggesting that she is descended from someone like the Amphibian Man.

Elisa's scars are too similar to gills to just be a coincidence so I obviously noticed that connection but I didn't think about how she only had sex in water until seeing that. Looks like a good theory.",7llz2i

drxqpfs,[deleted],7llz2i
dttnqy1,"[spoiler spoiler](#spoiler) everything after this is going to be a spoiler so stop reading if you don't want it spoiled

Here's my theory. I believe that Elisa is possibly the same species as the Fishman but has undergone metamorphosis, similar to how Axolotls can very rarely undergo metamorphosis and turn into salamanders.

According to [this website](http://www.axolotl.org/tiger_salamander.htm),

> The Axolotl is a ""perennibranchiate"" salamander (it never loses its gills).

Elisa was found in near a river at a young age and has had her gill scars ever since she was young.

> An axolotl that metamorphoses prior to when it begins to reach sexual maturity will usually lead a somewhat normal life. It will eat the same food and behave in a similar manner to the Tiger Salamander

Elisa could have metamorphosed into a human, lead a somewhat normal human life and ate the same food and behaved in a similar manner to humans.

> Axolotls that change after they have reached sexual maturity tend to be very weak animals... They frequently become disinterested in food and it may be difficult to get them to feed at all.

I recall, during the first scene where you see Elisa, feeling as if the person I was seeing was someone who was malnourished and did not eat often or much.

> Perhaps most noticeably, they absorb their gills and their lungs develop in capacity to the extent that they can breathe air directly from the atmosphere.

Anyway, I'm not sure if it's concrete enough. I did read someone's comment saying they read the wiki and the Fish dude just had super powers and turned Elisa into an underwater-breathing creature but I'm going to just pretend like this theory is true because it makes sense to me.

Also, unrelated to the theory but just about the movie in general, I felt it was amazing. I have not had an experience where I went to the cinema and had such a good, wholesome time. We had a small audience, maybe only 20% of the seats filled but we were all sitting in the good section (middle to back) and only a seat or two at most between other people. The majority of the audience were cute couples old and young. Everyone there laughed together, people reacted well at other people's reactions. Everyone just had a warm, great time and for once, I didn't feel like I was in the cinema with strangers but I was in the cinema with other humans all thinking and breathing the same story unfolding in front of us. It really made the movie something special for me, for it to have that much of an impact. It literally made me go home, jump on reddit and post about it and I don't really post that much.

Anyways I've talked for too long. Hope the editing on this comment is good cause I had to learn how to put in links and quotes. 
",7llz2i
dscvrvd,"Honestly I feel like this movie is more Hyped than it should be. I mean there are some huge issues with the film.

1. Eliza accesses the top secret room way to easy. She accesses like it is her own house. No security or Camera's around. It just felt ridiculous. There was more security on the laundry docks which LOL was also terrible for a top secret base. Just push it to the side. Not even joking.

2. The Love story between Fishman and Eliza was rushed and there was no build up. Where was the Build up? I have seen better romances in comedies. There was no epic romance.

3. Useless subplots where the time could have been used to better develop Fishman and Eliza.

4. They beat you over the head the Strickland is a Villain and scum of the earth. They even add a scene where he hits on Eliza that is absolutely useless and pointless. 

With that being said I still gave this film an 7-8/10. Beautiful Art, Beautiful music and the plot wasn't terribly bad. The plot was just kinda of bland. All the actors did an amazing job. 

I did like a Quote from Strickland which said something along the lines of: ""Just because it thinks, look sorta human and can feel we shouldn't kill it yet we kill soviets everyday in war"" ",7llz2i
dseoci5,"

 I'm intrigued by Del Toro's takedowns of the typical male leads from older eras. The villain was truly a wretched man, privledged but still suffering under the expectations of society and masculinity. The whole film is a reminder that America wasn't ever really 'Great' at this time in history, especially for people like our mains - the women, POC, LGBTQ, fish people. And yet it was stifling for white men as well, an era of artifice, where those in power were lesser by their homogeneity, lacking the camaraderie of those they oppressed and disenfranchised. And that's only a small part of what you can talk about. Sigh. I've fallen in love with another film. Del Toro always delivers.",7llz2i
dsjzv6h,"Truly one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen in theaters. If you told me the plot beforehand, there's no way I would've believed that this was a good movie, but it is an outstanding movie.  

For one, this was my first del Toro movie, and man, did he make an impression. This film was aesthetically gorgeous from the second it began to the moment it ended. The pacing, camerawork, etc. were amazing. I have to admit that I was upset when del Toro beat Nolan for Best Director at the Globes, but del Toro puts forward a really incredible effort in this movie.  

Second, the acting, across the board, was amazing. Hawkins, Spencer, and Jenkins were all as good as advertised and deserve all the awards recognition they're receiving. My friend and I both walked out of the theater ranting about how good Michael Shannon was, and then it just extended into us extolling each actor's work. Really really incredible work.

I feel like this movie did a lot of things right but never saw anything all the way through.
I liked that the side characters got some sort of a background (ie Giles art and painting) but that had no relevance to the movie which is weird....
I did enjoy when Strickland's [wife brought out green jelly...that was a tasteful easter egg] (#spoiler)
A lot of things were missing. There was no build on the space race or the USSR vs. USA, so another aspect of the movie that had no significance...

dvjl1gl,"Hmm. Clearly wanted to be an emotionally powerful film but fell flat for me. Completely predictable story at every point. The relationship was rushed and I didn’t really feel it. Didn’t like the main character, I don’t know what it was but it seemed like she was just horny and a bit creepy rather than sympathetic and in love. 

The side characters weren’t very memorable (why did they even spend any time at all with Giles painting career?). The villain was incredibly cliche and corny levels of evil. It seemed like the film didn’t know what it wanted to be, like how long it spent kind of being almost like a spy thriller on the escape and with the Russians. So much time that could have been spent actually developing a relationship and making us feel something. 

Cinematography didn’t even seem *that* special to me. Definitely nice at times but not even the best of the year by a long shot in that regard. 

The very end scene of the film was pretty cool but it was like 20 seconds of the movie and completely unearned. 

Maybe my expectations were wrong, but I was watching this thinking it was going to be a real arty romance film when most of it was like a *really* generic blockbuster movie. It was a bizarre feeling of a film that could have been aimed at children but included loads of nudity and fucking.",7llz2i
droiqj5,"I went out of my way to see The Shape of Water before it got the full release, not knowing it was going to get one. I regret nothing. It is my movie of the year. It's feels like it was specifically designed for me. I love the way everything looks. The vibrant colours, the 60's cold war culture and societal paranoia. The fact that it Stars a Mute character and it's use of sign language. The creature design that harkens back just enough to Gill-Man to elicite my earliest memories of watching Creature Features with my Grandpa. The beautifully handled and told love story that under different direction would come off as creepy instead of sincere. That black and white dance sequence when Elisa Tries to sing is beautiful.

For the mid-part of the movie he's basically an animal, both when he's being tortured by Strickland or befriended by Giles. And then of course he's at his most human when communicating with Eliza. 

It's only at the very end when he [absolutely ends Strickland](#spoiler) does his body language completely change into a being that is beyond animal, beyond human. He inspires *awe*, the same effect I've seen in much larger movie monsters, like Godzilla or King Kong.",7llz2i

- her clothing is usually green but the pair of shoes she covets are red
- the asset is green
 - green lime pies
- the advertising Giles painted promoted something green

The love relationship between Aquaman and Eliza felt rushed, and the lack of reaction of the side characters to the whole relationship felt out of context for the 60s or 50s. Shannon's character was one dimensional and overly cartoonish for my liking, and the advance that Jenkins's character made on the pie guy was totally out of place for me.

drnarv9,"Anyone underwhelmed? The movie is basically the trailer. With Del Toro helming I thought the third act would be insane but nothing really happens. It remains a simple love story with Michael Shannon attempting to stir trouble but being dealt with with ease. 

Gorgeous cinematography and good characters but not much to the story plot wise.

My nitpick: I thought it was odd that they would occasionally show the creature acting like an animal. The cat scene and others like it were so awkward when followed up with the main character sleeping with him. I never felt like he was above the intelligence of a monkey, and I'd take issue with someone having sex with a monkey. Wish we saw more intelligence displayed. 

Michael Shannon trying to go after the creature solo was very silly and led to a very unfulfilling climax. I'd have loved to see the creature be a real monster and present some more moral questions such as is the rampage justified and did all those government agents deserve to be maimed. Instead it's just one villain that really seems to live to be villainous getting his throat slashed after shooting people.

(1) Does anybody know the author of the poem at the end of the movie? As far as I can tell, the words are ""Unable to perceive the shape of you, I find you all around me. Your presence fills my eyes with your love, It humbles my heart, for you are everywhere."" I've tried every nook and cranny of Google, and can't find the source. Maybe it was a specially written for this movie?

(2) Why did Elisa have to release the creature in the dock? I get that rain fills it up to sea level, but why couldn't she just release him in the ocean and bypass the dock altogether? Maybe he's a freshwater creature so he needs water in the dock to adjust to the ocean's salt levels? Or is he not going to the ocean at all, and to docks lead to a different freshwater source?

How she described how the aquaman saw her for her and the poem at the end had a couple of tears out that I havent seen since forest gump. Im a 35 year old man for got sakes.

dtgqpus,"This movie is hard to describe for me. The great parts were great but there were also some glaring issues. While being a 2 hour movie TSoW somehow felt rushed while dragging at the same time. I felt the focus was in the wrong spot. They needed to have a lot more time spent on Elisa and the creature bonding/getting to know each other. Instead we get an egg, some music, then kidnapping and a sexual relationship. The feel of the movie was wonderful though. Soundtrack and performances were some of the best of the year along with some really cool underwater shots!

Also were we led to believe that Elisa wasn't really 100% human to begin with? They said she was an orphan found by the water and had scars on her neck where gills would be. Also the movement of water on the bus window. ",7llz2i
du6a76u,"I think my main tiff with this film is that there's not a whole lot of tension. The middle part had a lot of sweet scenes and it's not like the story suffered from not having enough tension (because there was a lot of tension in a few scenes) but I feel as though there should have been a bit more tension and pressure to find the Asset. 

But perhaps that's just my perception of generic movie formula getting in the way of what is supposed to be a fairy tale love story. Although I feel as though there should've been more tense moments in there, the story did not suffer from not having as much tension.  ",7llz2i

Cause in that scene with his wife, he makes her silent as they have sex and later on he harasses Elisa in a bit to get with her. Just a power thing or?",7llz2i

The entire film was colour-graded and lit in a way that always made it reminiscent of being underwater with deep blues and ~~greens~~ teals. Obviously there’s a very overt amount of water-imagery but I thought the cinematography was exceptionally clever. All credit to Dan Laustsen, who again is exceptional when he collaborates with Del Toro. Desplat’s score is also worth a mention. The seamless mix of golden era Hollywood scores with the quiet recurring themes was really enjoyable. 

Certainly not the best romance of the year (I give that to Call me By Your Name), nor Del Toro’s best (Pan’s Labyrinth) but a thoroughly creative and enjoyable film.

I love the feeling when you leave the theater in a different state of mind -- contemplating the emotions and themes of the movie and looking at things in a different way. I thought the movie was essentially all about .... what I want to say is femininity, for lack of a better word. More like receptivity and the female polarity. Some of the ""facts"" of the movie were so strange -- you could never fill a bathroom with that much water -- but the emotions were so real that to me I didn't feel cheated by the logical questions. It wasn't a logical movie. I thought the ending was great because it just put the whole story in lens of it being a fairy tale. It's not supposed to be a story where the facts make sense. It was about the emotion. I read some of these descriptions and have a way different viewpoint. Eliza wasn't lonely at all -- she was a happy person. The monster wasn't lonely. The monster was a powerful, spiritually connected being. ",7llz2i

Everything is so black and white, the good people are angels and the bad people devils. It just seems so adolescent. 

I though it was really well done, acting, directing, art, etc. It just wasn't pulling my strings or keeping me interested.

The model for this movie feels like such a throw back. I guess the hook is the monster love story, but I'd rather see all of those elements but in a different style of story telling, less cliche.

I guess the classic and cliched elements were intentionally juxaposed with the progressive and usual elements, but to me I'd rather someone Tell a story in a unique...to match the unusual story. I just felt bored on the whole.

But if i think about it....i do have an appetite for classic illustration, nostaligia and other things. This was no doubt Guellermo at his finest with directing, I always enjoy how he handles period and this was no exception. Maybe I just wasn't up for a love story.

Now, we know this universe contain fantasy beasts (fish dude) , however my question is with Elsa.  Is she also the same species as fish man (or at least partially).  Zelda tells us she was an orphan found by the banks of a river.  Additionally Elsa can't speak verbally but can make verbal noises (like fish man).  The fish man is capable of learning ASL which would also indicate she could as well with enough teaching.  Fish man has both lungs and gills but cannot survive out of water forever to what I understood as limited experience in an out of water environment.  Elsa has been outside water for most of her life which would allow her to build out her lungs instead of gills.  We see Elsa has 3 scars on both sides of her neck (which become gills from fish god).   However it is mentioned in the movie this is from someone cutting her voicebox(makes no sense anatomically).

So my question is, was Elsa of the same species as fish god (or half-breed) with evidence from above",7llz2i

dsg688q,"*Dr. Hoffstetler Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Fishman*

I absolutely loved this movie, particularly the first 2 acts. It felt like an adult take on a Disney fairy tale. However, I felt the last act dragged a little too long and there was some redundancy with a few scenes throughout the film. For example, we don't really need multiple masturbation scenes to understand Eliza is a naturally very sexual person. I also would have opted for a little more development before only one ""big"" fishman sex scene. 

That was the weirdest paragraph I've ever written.

Major props to Alexandre Desplat for that incredible score and to Sally Hawkins for that absolutely standout performance.

Guillermo fully deserves his Golden Globe for this movie and I hope he gets the Oscar as well. I think this will be a favorite for film classes to analyze color theory. Every shot was oozing with emotion.",7llz2i
dsyk7hz,"SPOILERS:

I didn't love this movie as much as I wanted to, and I really really wanted to.  Didn't hate it or anything, but it seemed like it needed more time in the ~~often~~ *oven* in terms of the writing.

Biggest issue was that I felt nothing for the fishman beyond pity in the way I'd pity any mistreated creature.  Elisa is the protagonist and we're supposed to understand and follow her, but she basically jumps instantly into trusting the fishman after seeing that he's capable of biting a man's fingers off.  There was no real poignant moment where we saw what Elisa saw, where she discovered there was more to him than what everyone else saw... she just kinda instantly loved him.

Beyond that, it was very quickly accepted by everyone else in her life, it seemed, that he was more man than fish.  When she tells Zelda, for example, that she's physically romantic with this thing, Zelda just giggles it off!

Really I think we needed less time with Strickland and Hoffstetler's side-stories - Hoffstetler's was especially pointless since him being a spy didn't really amount to anything in the end.  He could have just as easily been a kindly scientist willing to help Elisa and served the same ultimate purpose, and the time dedicated to his story could have been repurposed in getting us to better understand Elisa and fishman's relationship.

Visually it was incredibly beautiful, and I loved so much about it, but in the end the story just fell surprisingly and disappointingly flat for me.",7llz2i

Cons: story

Why does story keep getting the shaft in movies? I guess looking at people's reactions, they don't really care for a solid well-thought out story. Even in fantasy worlds, there should be rules defined and the story should stick to it. 

I would have liked to see a bit more background into the mermaid creature, instead of turning it into a ""god/jesus"" character with human-like uber fit body.

And why do the same old twist (actually not a twist since it's so predictable) of main character seemingly dying but then miraculously coming back to life? Why do it twice?! Can't we just have the creature shot dead at the end? or Elisa dying trying to save the him? If you don't want them to die, then why go through the same old ""bad guy finds out where good guys are through ridiculous luck and coincidence only to fail at the very last minute""... it's not exciting anymore, and super predictable.

All I want is some realism and logic in the story. It can be done even in fantasy settings, and it can make money too! See Game of Thrones, or Dark Knight.

du3ruu3,"A lot of people are saying the pieguy is homophobic, but flip genders and assume it was a female waitress just trying to make a living by being friendly to customers. She acts nice to a much older man, and in return, the older man immediately grabs her hand inappropriately and makes a pass at her. In response, she pulls her hand away and says he probably shouldn't come back to the restaurant. 

They threw in the black couple right before that to make pieguy look like an asshole, but his interaction with Richard Jenkins was totally acceptable, and if anything it was Jenkins who acted inappropriately by touching his hand.

I thought the characters were good, but as many have commented the love story between the Asset and Eliza felt a bit forced/jumpy. Also I thought Strickland was a bit too much of a classic villain, but that might be a nod to the movies of that time-era by Del Toro.

A couple of possible plot holes regarding cameras in the tank room, unsupervised cleaning etc,  Strickland seeing the Asset's ability to heal, and why the russian spy would snitch just before dying. Also something I haven't seen mentioned here is how Zeldas husband was so fine with just sitting and watching the confrontation instead of doing something. 

And. WHY the sing/dance performance? Yes we get it she's dreaming of being able to sing, but that idea never develops, she never gains her voice back. Minus points for the sudden LaLa Land break into song.

Music was great, very romantic and somehow felt as a good match to the environment (maybe a bit of french vibes with the accordion, but Desplat explained that with tying the asset's sound to something south american so fair enough).

The main villain just filled me with dread in every scene he was in; I feel like Guillermo did an amazing job at illustrating his evil by actively not TELLING us 'he's a bad guy' and instead showing it. 

The use of the fingers as a metaphor for his decaying beliefs and humanity, the car scene where the salesman reads him as the 'perfect everyman' of the 1950s felt sickening when we know just how evil this guy is. The sex scene between him and his wife was incredibly unsettling to me, and the first time that I felt dread start to creep in (which only got worse!).

Idk, can't put my finger on it but something was lacking or could've been smoothen out. 

And Sally Hawkins, wow. I like Frances McDormand's performance in Three Billboards, and I know she's the front runner this awards season.  But I'm really rooting for a Sally Hawkins win.  The scene where she pleads her friend for help,  she sold that so well. 

Michael Shannon was terrifying.  At first I thought,  ""okay,  pretty good villain.  he's okay. "" But in the scene where he asks Elisa if she could squawk, he really terrified me. I was soo worried for Elisa the entire time after that.

Some highlights:

- **Sally Hawkins:** 

Incredible. She portrayed the loneliness of someone with a disability really well, and I cracked up when she signed to Octavia Spencer how she and the asset got it on. 

- **The daydream dance number sequence:** 

I honestly waited for the creature to go ""PUHEN UHN DUH RIIITTTZZZZZZ!"" from 'Young Frankenstein', but aside from that visualization, I thought it was great to see and feel what Elisa was going through. 

- **Michael Shannon:** 

Honestly one of the best cinematic villains of the decade, and the first time I've seen a government baddie ""off the clock"", with his family, doing everyday stuff like buying car, getting his confidence back. This is the perfect example of a great villain: **relatable, resilient, intimidating, and will do whatever is necessary to finish the job, no matter who's in their way**.

- **Doug 'Not The Alabama Senator' Jones:**

I feel like Jones and Andy Serkis are the Boris Karloff & Lon Chaney Jr. of this day & age. They all have these iconic characters that require a heavy amount of physicality that draws the viewer into the movie, and Jones adds another memorable role to his career to go with Abe Sapien, The Pale Man, The zombie from 'Hocus Pocus', etc.

- **Guillermo 'Money!' del Toro:** I f my boy doesn't get an Oscar, I'll be pissed, because this is going to be what Schindler's List was for Spielberg. A mature masterpiece from the director Hellboy and Pacific Rim.

3. Why are there no subtitles for the Russian parts? I didnt see it at the cinema but the digital version should include them, otherwise its a guessing game.

5. Why do they have to bang in this movie and does she get preggo with a weird mermaid baby? This isnt even explored

6. Why wait so long to release him. She could just throw him in the sea, absolutely zero reason to wait for the lock to fill up.

7. So his entire diet for several days was just a few eggs? Lol ayyy, oh and a cat. 

8. Cat scene ruined the movie for me. All it did was bring home the fact that its a wild animal. Chances are if they get in a big argument or the monster doesnt get his own way he will slash her throat too, its so unhinged emotionally.

9. The dude she lives with is incredibly fickle. So he refuses to help her take the creature and save him. Walks his ass down to the bar where his young (too young for him) gay crush works, gets rejected, then comes back home and says he will help her. What because he realises she has someone who understands her which means a lot to her? He should have acknowledged that anyway, instead he was very selfish and it took rejection to change his mind.

dsqkekj,"Damn, so I really disliked this movie to be honest, which is disappointing because I was so ready to love it. I guess that in the end, I couldn't get over that I was watching a movie about a mute woman who seems mentally disabled falling in love with a fish man. I could've done without the emphasis on sexuality that the whole film had. I thought it added nothing and took away from the film's tone. I thought the Russians were stereotypical, and so was every character on the American side. I thought Octavia Spencer's character in particular was quite the ""yessuh"" stereotyped relic; it was quite embarrassing to watch. 

That being said I thought the design of the fish-man was genius, and the film (for the most part) looked great. I thought the character of the man who lives with Elisa was hilariously depressing, especially the scene where he walks in on Elisa and fish-man banging in the bathroom. 

I could go on about what I remember, but I honestly thought Michael Shannon's character was fucking terrible. He was this nonsensical amalgamation of every negative stereotype of a man from this time period, and he took me out of the film with every word he said. He was racist, rapey, sexist, red-scared, gun-loving, and a caricature. 

I found myself laughing (not audibly, don't worry I wasn't disrupting the theatre) through most of the movie, which saddened me, because it was probably my most anticipated movie in a while, I'd listened to the score a lot in the weeks previous (which was phenomenal by the way). If I had to rate it out of 10, I'd give it a 4. I think Del Toro in recent years is one of the most overrated directors in Hollywood. ",7llz2i
dv22953,"The way she develops a love interest in the creature is not believable at all. It's just there, suddenly. In one scene it is making scary fish noises at her and the next she is feeding it and playing it music. Her character seems so forced, it is very difficult to connect with her and the story. 

All the characters and their actions seem so one dimensional, almost childish.

The imagery/aesthetic is well done but also slightly too familiar for someone who has seen Del Toro's previous films. As a fan of his I felt a sort of obligation to stick with it to the end. Disappointing.",7llz2i
dv9khap,"Went in completely blind to this due to seeing it win best picture, and hadn't even seen a trailer for it. Honestly I don't see where that award comes from, but I will give it credit for the amazing cinematography. It just felt like a weird romance without any romance. She's feeding him hard boiled eggs and 20 minutes later they're fucking in the shower? I guess I just feel like there was no build up at all of their romance. How did the asset even know what sex was, how did it just immediately become attracted to her. The music was pleasant as well, but again I am not seeing the best picture award anywhere in the movie. It had some strange pacing and I don't see how she just opened some crazy secure bay door like that over and over again on a daily basis when this was apparently one of the most top secret assets they received at that facility.

dvcbu9p,"I just didn't get it. As many have said it was predictable, almost to the point of preachy at times. Also people keep saying it was beautiful but although there were some nice cinematographic elements in general my take away was the ugliness of everything from the fish to the rotting fingers to the unnecessary vulgarity at times that added nothing to the plot.
I had no investment in any character besides Giles because no one else had more than one dimension/motivation. Bad guy in particular was so cartoon bad he almost became funny. And throwing some casual rapey overtones in there did not have the impact I think he was aiming for it just made him even more of a joke character who is just ""evil"" for the sake of plot.
And I did not for a second believe the relationship between fish guy and the girl. When were they supposed to have fallen in love? Because they both like boiled eggs?!
For me it scanned more like a horror/cautionary tale than ""modern fairy tale."" Disappointing ",7llz2i

It felt like someone just smashed Splash and Creature from the Black Lagoon together.  And like others have mentioned, I felt Elisa and the creature fell in love way, way too fast. I would have liked to see more scenes documenting their initial meetings and less scenes of Michael Shannon screwing the wife who never shows up in any subsequent scenes.

dtvjtcd,"I put off seeing this for a long time because I was not expecting to like it at all for various reasons - but wow - it was just *beautiful* and really weaves a spell. Some of the best production design I have seen in a long, long time, Sally Hawkings was wonderful and the creature design struck a perfect balance between not overly cute while still being appealing enough.

The good elements were SO good they made me overlook the one glaringly (IMO of course) bad element -- I quite like Michael Shannon  in some things but I already very much disliked this same basic character in Boardwalk Empire. IMO it was a bad idea to cast him in this part.

I would add, that 'Fred Astaire' musical number didn't work for me either. If they had spent less time on Michael Shannon and even more time on developing her relationship with the creature maybe it would have worked better. I also found it curious they did not 'pay off' her being able to speak at the end more.

These issues aside - I think its one of the best films of the year and really the first del Toro film I have liked.

NOTE: One thing I really REALLY liked about this film was how though it was set in 1962 - so much of it was steeped in earlier eras of too.  Growing up only slightly later myself, there were so many old movies and TV shows on TV in some ways the 60's really WERE like this mishmash of the 'current' and the past. It really adds nuance when historical films don't just target the era of the setting but earlier times too. ""Hudsucker Proxy"" was another film that got that really well.",7llz2i

I’ve been trying to find something to explain it but I can’t think of a damn thing that makes sense realistically in terms of the story. My best guesses are that either:


A) he spent much of his time in saltwater, but would sometimes come through tributaries or other channels and heal this tribe’s injured/sick possibly? Leading to them to anoint him as a “god”. 


Or


B) Del Toro just threw this tidbit in as to pay homage to Creature from the Black Lagoon, which he took great inspiration from in the Asset’s design.

I mean if the assets healing powers could grow Giles' hair back overnight, shouldn't he have been able to give Elisa her voice back? 
Could the theory of Elisa being an amphibian explain this as the asset himself didn't have the ability to make human like noises and thus Elisa couldn't either?",7llz2i
drqsufj,"Caught this opening night after heavily anticipating for its release and was delighted. Sally Hawkins was so charming and fitting for the leading role, I was blown away by her performance. This movie was so unique, so refreshing in so many ways. I was a bit shocked by some bits of the movie - Elisa masturbating every morn, the cat getting bit, Strick's fingers getting picked up, actual sex between the couple, Strick violently banging his wife etc. I wasn't taken back in a bad way, I just simply didn't expect these violent/raw scenes to be in there and they made the movie much more surreal.   

What I really liked about this movie was how Elisa took on each day. I hate work and the ""mundane"" parts of life but how they made her take on each morning task was... beautiful? She set her alarm, boiled eggs, cleaned her shoes.. the sound and imagery just made this routine seem glamorous and motivating. My favorite scene was Elisa going home from work, patting her hat against the window and looking out as we see how a droplet of water travels.  
I also loved her relationship with old Giles next door - how they sought each other in times of loneliness and sadness. The movie was heartwarming in so many ways. And how could I forget one of my favorite actors, Michael Shannon? God he was great as Strick, especially in that beat up car with rotting fingers. ",7llz2i

He constantly buys two pies from the shop, as evidenced by the fridge full of pies, but she never eats them. He also seems to forget this all the time. IIRC no one ever mentions her, or speaks to her, while he is with her during the entire film (I might be wrong here, feel free to correct me). He also claims he is unable to recognize his face in the mirror sometimes, and constantly repeats the phrase ""I think this might be my best work yet"". I think he might be suffering from dementia.

It truly left me speechless. I mean yes, the story might have been something that we've heard before, pairing a human and a non-human, but the aesthetics, the details about each characters, and the possibilities for the ending are just wonderful! I don't see any problem with pairing a human and a non-human character. It's a fantasy story and the whole point is that she felt like she was loved and accepted by him a lot more than anyone else and he embraced her as a living being and looked at what she had rather than rejected her for being different and reminded her of what she lacks, and the movie did give a hint that she was an orphan found by the water, and the scars on her neck were so mysterious and conveniently used to make gills, so it made me wonder what if she was like him all along? what if she started looking like a human being because she was raised by him or was of a similar species that looked more human and the doctors who found her merely sewed up the gills thinking they were wounds?",7llz2i

To start with, I found the masturbation scene very interesting. At first I thought it was just for show but then when I started to reflect on it, it was shown from the female perspective. When it comes to female sexuality in movies, it always from the male point of view. How they view our most intimate moment as something that it really isn't or female masturbation is never discussed. They did take risk in those scenes but it is admirable. 

Moving on, one thing I was curious about is when they are initially in the bathroom for the first time.

If I had to critique something it would be that the characters are a bit plain.

I feel a lot of viewers/critics refer to Strickland as a one-dimensional antagonist, but to me, he seemed like another of society's rejects, though not to the extent of Elisa, Zelda, Giles or Fishman; he's this model 60's guy, perfect wife, perfect kids, good job with authority, and yet it seems there's something missing. He isn't close to his wife or kids and the authority he tries to project seems to mask some insecurities. He buys the Cadillac to imbue himself with a feeling of power but it doesn't really work (and the car gets smashed anyway; it's power is vulnerable). His speech to Hoyt about only having failed once was very revealing, I thought. He's a guy who has always done what he was supposed to, embodied the American ideal, and yet is disposable to those above him, and has no connections in life.

I thought it ended OK, but would have perhaps ended better [if A) both Fishman and Elisa had died (a bit of a heavy-handed ""the only way these two precious souls can be together in this cruel world is through death"" kind of way, but would have fit the film) or if every thing had happened they way it did except Strickland doesn't die, and instead has to spend the rest of his life knowing he tortured and abused a 'god' or at least a sentient creature with incredible abilities.](#spoiler) ",7llz2i
dujgbcd,"I really liked this movie. As usual Guilermo Del Toro delivers on the visuals. I just felt the movie had one fatal flaw. I had no idea why Eliza wanted to fuck the fish guy? They established their romance in 5 minutes. So I didn't feel invested in their relationship as much as I should have been. And as result the rest of the movie suffered. Which is a shame because the rest of the movie is masterfully done. 

I really enjoyed the characters. Sally Hawkin's managed to carry the film on her facial expressions alone. Michael Shannon was delightfully menacing, and his metaphorical dialogue held my all my attention. Giles was also a very interesting character, his arc was quite unpredictable in little ways such as his story with the Pie guy, and his very understanding and calm reaction to Fish guy eating his cat.

The cinematography the more I think about it, is up there with Pan's Labyrinth. It's beautiful laid in it's simplicity. The use of colours were intriguing. 

The OST was also enjoyable to listen to. I don't really have much to say.

Themes: The film was very much about the dangers of  conformity, and to embrace the uniqueness of the world. I liked how it dealt with prejudice in a variety of ways. Of course with Eliza's and Fish man's romance, but also Pie guy's racism, the whole cold war paranoia and it's hatred of subversives, Delilah commenting on how all short men are bastards, and then the short russian scientist helps them out the most. Michael Shannon's insistence of being the perfect 50s man. 

Over all I like this movie. I just wished it was a bit longer so it could really expand on Eliza's and Fish man's romance.

dtf7w95,"For me, the film is only propped up by the audience's ability to recognize and relate to the overarching themes of loneliness and nonacceptance. 

If you analyze each character, they each have their own form of victimization. Rampant racism impacts the African American characters. Homophobia destroys the career and love life of Eliza's gay friend. Eliza, as a woman, is mistreated and underestimated by Strickland, as well as being alone in the world her whole life with a disability. Russians are abhorred by Americans, making the scientist feel alone and constantly under threat. Even Strickland takes a victim role when the General brands him as a failure, despite decades of flawless and loyal service. 

It is that fear or dislike of nonacceptance that drives and motivates all the characters in this film, which felt to me like a stale and lazy way to link the characters. As a huge fan of Pan's Labyrinth, which has a much stronger grasp on a variety of character motivations and ties them together beautifully into the plot, I personally didn't enjoy TSoW enough to rank it up there with GdT's best films, but I can see why some would disagree, as it resonates perfectly with the lonely and the victimized.

The story was very simple, she has a plan to break the merman out of the facility. They do it pretty much as expected.  
Apart from the lead, the characters really don’t change between the start and the end of the film. The back stories of the other characters are the briefest of pencil sketches, with almost pointless scenes of buying a car, trying to get a job back; that do nothing for the story or character arcs.
  
I have a lot of questions, the first being the most puzzling, perhaps I missed an explanation.
Why didn’t they take him immediately to the ocean, why wait days for rain to fill a canal?  
Could he survive in the ocean off Baltimore? He’s from a river in South America and needs special conditions to survive in the bath and facility.
How could the agent find exactly where they were from the word ‘Docks’?  
How did Octavia’s character know exactly where to go, perhaps she knew from off screen conversation, but how did she get there? Did she call the police, she seemed to arrive with them? They believe a black cleaning lady and send a large squad of cars, I wonder what she could have said. The generals threat about an agent shaped hole and alternate realities, seemed bizarre if he was trying to just threaten the agent into solving the case. You think there’d be giant team of investigators assigned to the case given the importance of a missing merman. Oh but they are keeping it secret, but not from the cleaning staff. The agent has very little time to solve the case and believes it was done by a team of specially trained foreign against, but spends his last night in a car outside Dmitris. How could he follow and creep up behind the Russian spies in his large 1960s car with them knowing?
Why was the film set in the sixties but all the music was from the thirties and forties? Style I guess, but it seemed a bit out of place.  
All the foreshadowing of her having some previous connection, gill like marks, being found by a river, came to naught.

First was setting his character up when he asserts his Alpha status in the restroom while the Elisa and Zelda are cleaning. He chooses to wash his hands before he urinates, even then doing so without holding his member and without caring that the women are still in his presence. I saw this as him more concerned about what he can get on him from the outside, rather than what he can spread to others.

The audio as he leaves was great foley work. He picks up his stun baton and the sound of it scraping against the counter revealed a lot about it. Just from that audio cue I could feel it in my hands, it's weight, and it's power. it only added to his dominance in that scene.

Finally, at the Cadillac dealership. He's already shown himself to be a man in charge, both at work and at home. Wherever he goes, he sees himself as the smartest man in the room. And yet, he can still be tricked by a car salesman. He doesn't realize that he's showing weakness by giving into the salesman and buying the car because he's getting noticed by everyone as the true Alpha he sees himself as.",7llz2i

dt2q9c2,"Not a massive fan.

First of all, so much of this movie was unnecessary. The entire sub-plot of the big bad guy in charge didn't have to be there. The scene with his wife pulling out her tit, him banging her and trying to tell her to be quiet, and buying a Cadillac didn't add to the film. I am fine with scenes that aren't ""plot"" driven, but these didn't help. The whole thing with his wife didn't need to be there, and the whole ""keep quiet"" thing and then liking a mute girl should have been built up. Otherwise it was just sort of touched on.

And Guillermo did this a lot. We hear Zelda talk a lot about her husband, and then he just sort of spills the beans to the dude in a throwaway scene that he's only in once. Should have intimidated her or found a more creative way for him to discover what was going on. That was kind of a cop out.

Also, I didn't find enough reasons to feel for anybody. Elisa seemed perfectly happy -- wake up, beat off, go to work with your friend, hang out with Giles, rinse repeat. I felt bad for Giles, a little, but at the same time we never understand really what's going on with him or why he can't find a different job or get his back or whatever, and the sort of rampant hatred for blacks and gays was over the top and didn't help the story. So, I didn't really care much about Elisa falling for the fish man, because her life seemed fine. And now, what's she going to do with her life? Swim around the murky water with the fish man...? I mean...what?

Also, the atmosphere was too much of a set 24/7. Everything felt too perfectly contrived. How am I supposed to feel bad for Giles and Elisa when they live in these picturesque apartments that have been so carefully created by a set designer? It's sort of Wes Anderson, but not quite. I couldn't find my way into the film. It doesn't rain 24/7 in real life. It's never sunny. It's always night time. But people seem quirky and happy...and don't behave like real humans. I found it hard to get into.

The whole thing with the dude's hands could have been played up better with the idea that the fish man could have healed him if Strickland had bothered to understand him.

I really think there was just too much going on in this movie, and I don't like films that begin with a montage. 

Elisa's unhappiness should have been played up more, as should Strickland's fascination with her. Strickland's wife should have been played up more or cut completely. Giles should have been more unhappy. The fish man's E.T. healing ability shouldn't have been revealed until right when Elisa and he were shot and without a real **life** at the end, I find it hard to root for Elisa just jumping into the water. Would any of you want to live underwater after having spent your life as a human? What are they going to do? I mean, I guess if there was some kind of fish kingdom under there then **maybe** I'd get it, but the ending seemed like shitty to me, because who wants to live in the murky water with nothing to do? 

Also, the fascination and enormous amount of old Hollywood shit was offputting and didn't seem to help the plot.",7llz2i

dsdi3lp,"So this movie is an example how the trailer that was released 6 months in theaters completely ruins a movie.  

So I did not see the movie trailer on youtube.

I went to the movies last summer and  they showed a trailer.

It gave away most of the plot of the movie.

Yes it was pretty, good cinematography, I understand that Del Toro does not have the rights to Hellboy Character Abe. 

But overall, really, was anyone surprised anytime during the movie.  

I did like Hoffstetler helped her get away with Doug Jones.

But to me the most important part of the movie is seeing Hoffstetler as a scientist first and a Russian second.  

I do not understand art at all, because yes I do watch pornography, but I have zero understanding why we need to see in the first 10 minutes Elisa masturbating.  I do not understand what that adds to the movie at all.

She is beautiful, she would have had 10 guys hitting on her every day.   There is no way Elisa would be as lonely as she was portrayed.  That was more unbelievable than a Fishman with god powers.

You want a love story,  make Zelda and the fishman a thing.

*edit* and I forgot the most important thing, sorry.

I did like that Del Toro gave a big fuck you to everyone by placing the apartments above a huge movie theater to leak into.",7llz2i
dsfq71o,"Hmm, I'm conflicted about this movie. I like it but I don't love it. Had a lot of expectations for it after all the hype, especially since I'm a fan of GDL, loved Pans Labyrinth, Pacific Rim, Hell Boy 2, even Blade 2. 

As expected his aesthetics were out of this world. The atmosphere and art decoration was amazing, had a lovely warmth about it. Wouldn't have thought it was Baltimore till they told us. Should've been left to the imagination. 

I didn't buy the sexual chemistry between the creature and Elisa. I saw it more like a pet-owner relationship. The sex scene was weird. Even the starting masturbation scene was out of place but then the sex scene was the pay off. But we've seen the pet-owner relationship many times before (King Kong) and probably GDL wanted to push the boundaries and take it one step further. 

Throughout the movie, I couldn't help wonder whether we really needed subtitles for Elisa, should've been left to the imagination or used secondary characters to help us. Then maybe I would've bought it more. 

P.S. How iconic is Richard Jenkins voice? I didn't even know he was in the movie, when his VO started, immediately recognised it. ",7llz2i
dru7mnq,"Finally got the chance to see it. I feel like it was a 30 minute idea that ran out of steam once fish guy was busted out of the facility. 

You have Michael Shannon playing the one role he's always typecast as and they use the 1960s shittiness as a rather bland shorthand so the audience knows he's the bad guy. It makes me wonder how he would have written this in a less stereotypical setting. Pretty much ended with the confrontation and by the books happy ending I expected.

Honestly, I'm a little disappointed just from the word of mouth it's been getting. It seems like an average film that gets promoted a bit beyond its punching weight for social issues rather than anything that makes it really interesting film. I didn't dislike it, it was well made and acted adequately, but it was very cliche and Hollywood by the numbers. I'd like to know if this was the entirety of GDT's vision or if he made changes to placate studios. Although I have to preface my comments by saying this might have been outside of my normal viewing range and I wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't Del Toro.

Overall, a well made average movie. I probably wouldn't put it at the top of my GDT movie list. I'd have to qualify it before recommending it to people who aren't looking for this kind of bland story. I'm not really sure it brings anything to the table that hasn't been done better elsewhere.

They should have said something like ""we found it in South America back in 53"" indicating that it had been in captivity for almost 10years.

dv64jd1,"my problems with the movie got summed up by someone else pretty well so i'm just going to copy paste it with my own bit at the end:

* Elisa Esposito is clearly set up for a big third act reveal that just doesn't happen. Her scars that were obviously going to turn out to be gills, the fact that she was found Moses-style near a river, and her Spanish name all suggested she would turn out to be related to the Amphibious Man in some way. And yet this never materializes, making me question what was the point of the setup. Yes, the Amphibious Man really turns her scars into gills, but what does it mean? Was she an amphibian all along and he ""woke up"" her vestigial gills, or did he turn regular scars into gills because it felt like a good idea to him? I don't understand why this was left ambiguous and without payoff.

* When we first see the Amphibious Man, he's shot in the gut by Michael Shannon's character after he bit off the fingers. Later we see other bleeding wounds on his fish body. And yet the scientists don't seem to notice he has magical healing powers. All they are concerned about is his breathing organs to utilize them in the space race somehow. Really? You shoot the thing in the gut and the next day it's completely healed and you don't question that and try to harness that healing power for the army? At the end of the movie, when Shannon sees the Amphibious Man get up and heal his wounds, he even exclaims ""So you are a god!"" Um, yeah. That's not the first time you're seeing him heal like that.

* Am I really supposed to believe there wouldn't be a security camera in the room where they keep the Amphibious Man? There's a whole plot point dedicated to the security camera in the docking bay and yet there's no camera in the room where they keep a creature like that? And no guard in there, either? They just let two cleaning ladies in there completely unsupervised with no security whatsoever?

* The Amphibious Man is supposed to be a river god. Michael Shannon mentions he found him in a river in South America. And yet he needs salt water to survive?

* I didn't really feel the romance between Elisa and the Amphibious Man develop properly. One minute she's feeding him boiled eggs and dancing in front of him with a mop, and the next thing you know she has shower sex with what is essentially a monster. That's a pretty huge leap. And her affection is apparently based solely on the fact that the Amphibious Man doesn't speak and doesn't seem to mind that Elisa is mute as well? Maybe if Del Toro developed that thing I mentioned in the first point about Elisa being an amphibian as well, that would explain their connection properly.

* I don't really get what was the point of Richard Jenkins' character's sub plot about trying to get the painting job with his former employer and trying to pick up the guy at the pie restaurant. Ok, he's gay and photography is taking over painted ads. So what? I don't think the movie needed the extra couple of minutes dedicated to this.

* I also don't get what was the point of Michael Shannon's severed fingers getting sewn back and then rotting away so he rips them off. Was this supposed to represent his character arc or something like that? I thought maybe the Amphibious Man would heal his fingers with his magic powers and use that to endear Michael Shannon (who would then shoot him anyway because he's a bad guy) but no. The fingers had no discernible purpose in the story. By the way, his apparent attraction to Elisa (because she's mute and that turns him on) doesn't really go anywhere, either.

overall the movie seems like a big oscar bait with a cliché story and some cheesy lines _""so you are a God""_. i did enjoy it to some degree though but not above 7/10.

The love story between the woman and the monster wasn't developed at all. They jumped from feeding to dancing to fucking to loving.

dry1mna,"I have to preface this with two things:

1) I respect del Toro but his work is....not my style. Pacific Rim was good, Hellboy 2 was good, I did not like the original Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth didn't resonate with me when I saw it.

2) Because of the above, I really had no interest in seeing this movie, but my dad really wanted to go and I'm only home for the week. Why not, got good reviews.

With those things said, basically what I expected. It's great visual imagery for a fantasy film as you expect with del Toro, Sally Hawkins put up a great performance, liked the early 60s Cold War setting, but I hated the film itself. 

The first hour to me was a drawl, Elisa is in love with this creature off of playing it music a few times and giving it eggs, and they're clocking in/out and mopping floors. I didn't really get a sense of chemistry between Giles and Elisa -
 they just seemed like two next door neighbors rather than friends. I was waiting for something to push the story forward and it didn't happen until the breakout sequence (which was great). The movie then got better, up until a bit after the ""underwater sex in the bathroom"" scene. And then came that dream sequence, which completely took me out of it and ruined the rest of the movie for me - sorry, when it's unexpected like that, I just can't buy it. Then from a writing standpoint, Dmitri is basically on their side and helps them smuggle the Asset out, but then has no problems selling them out when he knows he's dead and can give out some BS names, Michael Shannon doesn't know any better (lol at his wrecked car).

I knew the end was coming from the second he touched Richard Jenkin's arm because magic healing powers is such a common trope. The showdown at the end was cliche, there were a couple things that always happen in heist movies. Despite that, you have to award points for being weird as fuck and having a vision. That's the kind of thing I like to see.

The dialogue was smart and sometimes hilarious, especially a lot of Michael Shannon's lines. I really felt they went a little too far with the rape stuff. Like we're already rooting against him give us a break. The black lady was really bad in any scene that wasn't casual work banter.  The main character was great, she was both written and performed excellently. Richard Jenkins was great and the scene where he's talking to the fish guy in the bath tub was one of my favorite scenes in the movie. 

I thought the theme came across well without being too heavy handed. Setting it in the early 60's was a great choice thematically.

I definitely didn't really give a shit about the fish man. I gave a shit about the main character, and she gave a shit about the fish man, so that made me sort of give a shit about him, but I really couldn't take him seriously as a character. Like it was just too goofy at times and had me throwing up my hands and laughing at what a madman del Toro is. But I'm still enjoying it, it's just a bit too out there to take seriously at times.

Overall I'm glad I saw this movie and I'm glad this movie got made. I didn't love it but it was interesting, it was exciting. It was weird as fuck and had an artist's touch. We need more of this sort of thing. Kudos to whoever gave him money to make this crazy shit.

ds4d0d5,"""The Shape of Water"" is a fairytale written and directed by the famed creator Guillermo del Toro. In this narrative, del Toro tells a story about ~~interracial~~ inter-species romance in the Cold War era. Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) is a lonely, mute janitor at a highly secretive government department that specializes in the unknown. All is consistent until she begins to bond with a captured merman at the facility. By empathizing with the creature, she falls in love with him and concocts a plan for his escape. Accompanying her, is her best friend and roommate, Giles (Richard Jenkins) and coworker, Zelda (Octavia Spencer). Both seek what's best for Elisa and reluctantly support her as a means in improving their own lives. Though Elisa wants to love the merman, there are others who possess more nationalistic plans. Colonel Strickland (""I will find him!"" Michael Shannon) intends to dissect the merman for the good of the US government whereas his rivals in the Russians desires the same. In contrast to Strickland is Dr. Robert Hoffstetier (Michael Stuhlbarg), a man of science who desires the merman's safety and becomes torn between his patriotic duties and his personal ethics. Elisa's journey sees her love affecting all those around her. Del Toro's fairytale is a delightful experience with a powerful message concerning the most enchanting human feeling in love. It must also be said that this film is filled with visual subtleties that play a role in the plot. 

Sally Hawkins is no doubt the primary pillar in this movie. This film demanded much of her due to Elisa's disability. Any nomination she receives is well deserved. Each emotion Elisa feels is conveyed well. Elisa's anger, lust, and loneliness is not hidden from the audience. Spencer, Jenkins, Stuhlbarg, and Shannon compliment the fantastical nature of the film well. However, Spencer has been in a similar role before in ""The Help."" Del Toro's directing can be described as emotional. He wants the audience to feel for his characters and their harsh reality. Also, his signature film design fits in line with the story even though some elements are similar to Hellboy. The editing in this film felt a bit strange though. It feels as if there are some missing pieces but this can be resolved on a second viewing. The music, like del Toro's signature film design, seethes into the story making it whole. A few on this subreddit have compared the film to ""Amelie"", a similar fairytale about a quirky young lady in love. The music is likely the culprit behind this comparison since both composers, Alexandre Michel Gérard Desplat and Yann Tiersen, are French and have composed for several French films. Special mention must be made for the set designers and the special effect artists that brought this vivid, somber film to life. 

Overall, ""The Shape of Water"" is an enchanting film with a strong message about love. Experiencing Sally Hawkins portrayal as mute Elisa is worth the price of admission alone. Not to mention that Guiellermo del Toro direction and signature approach to film design allows this film to flourish and resonate with viewers. Watch this film on the big screen more than once. 

**Notes**

* Elisa's use of alarm clocks signifies to the viewer that she's mute and not deaf
* Giles and the merman are parallel to one another
* There is a scene with strong racial undertones that took me out of the movie for a moment. I found it too dark and unnecessary for the pseudo-lightheartedness del Toro was presenting
* Was anyone surprised that Elisa's scars transformed into gills? It was pretty obvious
* Dimitri had always known how his role was going to end
* Tap-dancing may or may not be the best indicator of friendship",7llz2i
dtggy54,"Meh, pretty disappointed with this. The performances were good and it looked good but everything else fell flat for me.

We had Downsizing, Molly's Game, Three Billboards, Lady Bird, All The Money. These movies all seem to be on about the same caliber in terms of size and budget. It's a violent movie and features some sex with a fish monster (from my understanding) but I don't think it's so offensive to the bible belt that it would stop a movie being shown here.

I loved the rain drops on the bus window the most but there were so many beautiful shots. The villains were brilliant too. I liked how the main villain had blood on his hands the entire time and even comments on the nature of handwashing of all things. The man who worked at the pie store too. It is slowly revealed to us that everything about his personality is fake. Accent, history of the restaurant, then his semblance of human decency is gone as soon as Giles reaches for his hand.

Six months before he even started to put some pressure on it. But [here's Strickland, with both fingers reattached practically using it to push off surfaces or grab objects within days.](#spoiler)

Albeit very specific, this annoyance leads me to how the fingers were one of many heavy-handed (pun intended in retrospect) metaphors and symbols throughout the film. [Blackening fingers representing the rotting of Strickland's soul, check. Neck scars on Elisa recognizable as gills from frame one, check.](#spoiler) Almost nothing but blue and green colors of the sea in nearly every frame, check.

Rather than immersing me in the story, these took me out of it. As did [the big dance number near the end.

dte73tj,"Spoilers ahead mateys!!!

Wow. Hollywood has become so incredibly transparent. So after The Artist, this is the movie that we have to fall in love with now. Because it is set in the early 60's, so nostalgia. Because the characters watch old black and white movies in their retro tv sets, while talking about how wonderful they are, so meta-nostalgia. Because the movie theater, the signs, the cars, the clothes, the pies and the diner...because nostalgia.

Honestly, the story seems forced. Some characters and their relationships seem forced and placed/written just to make a point. The sassy black woman who complains throughout the movie about her husband (one could say she's actually complaining about all husbands, on behalf of all women), and finally puts him down at the end as the spineless coward he is. The old man who is unnecessarily shown to be a homosexual just so we can feel bad for him when he makes a totally uncalled for advance on the man who works the diner, who is an obviously straight white dude, who, for a twofer, gets to have a random black couple walk into the diner just so he can be racist on top of homophobic. I'm not going to focus on the other ""good guy"" being an actual communist, because even though the whole Russians subplot felt unnecessary and a bit forced, I understood his character as a scientist with a conscience, which made me understand his actions beyond his political and patriotic allegiances. And I honestly don't believe there is any relevance to him being a communist good guy. It's more about him being a non-U.S. citizen good guy. Russians can be nice people too, did you know? Now you do.

Now on to the bad guy. I'm not going to remark on him being a heterosexual white male, because a person in his position, in that time, would invariably fit that description. It's the fact that he is cold, emotionless, detached, cruel, racist, arrogant, misogynistic, and a general ""meanie"" (haha). It's literally a character written by someone who calls out ""meanies"" online, to depict all the evil they perceive in the heteronormative white patriarchy. The funny thing is how they attempt to make the character profound or interesting, by making him get philosophical about pissing/washing your hands, and teaching us, I mean, the protagonists, about biblical characters and the meaning of certain complex-sounding words. And the whole bit about the candy. I don't get it. I don't buy it.

I'll admit I was impacted by the loneliness and detachment that the protagonist must have felt to have engaged in such a relationship with a non-human creature, and I actually had no issue with the sexual aspect of the relationship, because, you know, love is love. But a comment here on Reddit made me realize that it is no different from fucking your dog. She only humped it because it had a humanoid shape.  

The scene that perfectly encapsulates why you will be told to love this movie, is the fantasy sequence where the mute girl starts singing beautifully, and then tap dances with the sea creature on a beautiful stage backed by a big band. All in black and white, of course. Because, nostalgia.

The end also comes out of nowhere, when the creature somehow turns her scar tissue into functional gills. This is the only moment, other than the intro, when the movie felt to me like a fairy tale story. The movie itself didn't feel to me like it was trying to emulate Beauty and The Beast or some other tale, rather it was just inspired by it and other similar tales. The story felt like it was doing its own thing (unlike something like Pacific Rim, for example, which is meant to be viewed as an anime), which makes the fairytale intro and ending feel out of place and forced. 

If you like Guillermo Del Toro, who I'm not too much of a fan of, other than of his visual imagination, check out any of his other stuff. If you liked Sally Hawkins' performance (which is not ""stellar"", or ""phenomenal""), you'll be much better off seeing her in Happy-Go-Lucky or Made In Dagenham. Or watch her in this too (she does a good job) and make up your own mind about the whole thing. Just don't let Hollywood awards shows and critics dictate what you should watch and much less what you should like and love. Remember The Artist? Remember The Last Jedi?",7llz2i

I felt like after his Samson speech Strickland becomes way too run of the mill as a villian. He was really interesting for the first two thirds but just becomes this basic bad guy? I guess it's hard to explain.

Also some of the plot holes, while kind of minor, were glaring. No one saw The Monster when he escaped? Really? Again that's just a minor thing, really. 

The acting, the music, and story in general and the design were all really great. I guess I just wish there was something...more in the opening and ending acts. And that it wasn't so painfully predictable, though that's pretty subjective. ",7llz2i

But then they didn't do much with it and it just kinda went away. The motive for Esposito rescuing Sexy Fish Man was understandable, though superficial and could have used a little more depth. I wasn't really feeling any magic between the two. 


As a matter of fact, the whole script was a bit superficial. Where did the fish thingy come from? Why the need to kill it? What is Strickland's motivation for being such an asshole (I mean, he seems to be living the dream, what's up with him?)? And a whole bunch of other questions...

* I don't have a problem with Bob/Russian Spy being shot in the face, but do we need to see him being dragged through his bullethole?
* The whole bit with the fingers was fine until the very last confrontation where he snaps them off

I still think those scenes tonally fit but GDT could have handled each one in a more tactful way.

And then, when it's escaped, isn't it easier to just assume that it's dead? Why it was impossible to release him behind the flood gate? They got the van, they could drive him anywhere at all. Why cops at the end just standing there, and why Elisa's friend were with them? And what's with that dance scene? 

But all of that could be ignored, if only main theme were good enough. But i can't feel the most important thing - love between main characters. No, i am one of those persons who were never understood by others and i won't even touch a girl ever in my life, so i totaly understand how it is to be alone (but i don't think that being mute is that much of a problem here), and i know that other people are not really concidering me as a human because i have no value for them, just as the cleaner - they can't somehow benefit from me, so i am useles to them. So i get that message from a movie well. However, just meeting a random person who feels the same will do nothing for me. We are still strangers, with different interests, just being alone does not makes us interested in each other. I tried talking with other lonely people online and result are always the same - we are different, we share barely anything in common, it's just boring for both of us and being alone is better, then being with someone who is now your kind of humans. 

How two people can fall in love without communication? That would be passion, sexual attraction, but nothing more. If you can't even talk with each other except few words, why exacly do you love each other? He - just for threating him as human, she - for taking interest in her (and it's not like he really showed much)? For me that's not love, gratitude at best. I expected this movie to show how exacly do they fell in love, but it feels like that part was skipped somewhere off screen. 

It really reminded me of another dissapoiting love story - ""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"". There happens exacly the same - characters barely spent any time with each other and they suddenly ""in love"". You can't just tell that people love each other without showing how it happens, and why they fell in love at first place...

Shape of the Water was spectacular, from the visuals to the setting it was pure magic. This film dripped with fantasy and ambiance.

dumhmv9,"I'm in the UK so this is late (film only just came out here) No-one else here seems to have mentioned [her gills](#spoiler) Clearly Elisa has a mysterious origin. Does it relate to Lovecraft? GDT is a big fan of Lovecraft and has influences from his fiction in a lot of his films. One such story is A Shadow Over Innsmouth where fishermen in Innsmouth make a pact with an old god. They get gold but are corrupted and gradually become fish people over the years and generations and go into the sea to become worshipers for the god. Is Elisa a child of a cultist? 

It would have been nice to have a hint of Elisa's origin. Even a throwaway line like ""People down there thought he was a god. Damn cultists are everywhere doing unholy things.""

dro5ii8,"It was definitely a well made film, but sorry, it was terrible.

Sally Hawkin isn’t unnattractive, she's a pretty woman. You have to really have an ugly, pathetic person to make it where having sex with a fish monster seems “beautiful”. All it came across as was weird and forced. Simply being mute doesn’t justify creepy beastiality.

For the life of me I cannot understand why we even followed the subplot of Richard Jenkin’s artist job excursions. All of those scenes do nothing to further what was already shown in the pie subplot. He’s closested and a career failure, we get it. Having him not get an advertising job was irrelevant. If you have to pepper in scenes that do nothing to improve the motive of a character, then why are they in there? Elisa was already his only friend and the only person who cared about him. He had to get rejected from a job to further establish that? Nonsense.  

And Michael Shannon randomly fucking his wife? What the hell was even the point of that scene? It’s like Del Toro had no idea how to give this cartoony bad guy a backstory, so he gave him a new car, a couple of kids who like watching TV and rough missionary to try and flesh him out. Yikes.

Let’s also talk about that ending. Absoutely cliched to a T. And after all that ‘by the book’ nonsense, Richard Jenkins is going to end up going to jail for murder, considering not one police office on the scene is going to believe a 'fish monster' slit Michael Shannon’s throat. So much for that open-ended “happily ever after” ending.

I cannot understand the universal praise this film is receiving. Del Toro is easily one of the most overrated directors in the industry today. Other than 'Pan’s Labrynth', he hasn’t made one other film that will stand the test of time as classic, yet he continuously is praised like he’s the second coming of Spielberg.

Would be a travesty for this film to win Best Picture, like 'The Artist' all over again.",7llz2i

Amazing performances from everyone but it's not one I'd watch again, just because I struggled to find deeper meaning in this film. Sure there'd be the subtle nuances of little props and symbols but I was trying to think of deeper meaning that their love conceded to. 

It's sad to feel that out of all his potential ideas, this simple and predictable one is the only one that Guillermo del Toro is able to get fully funded and fleshed out into a release, rather than something entirely abstract like At the Mountain of Madness.

The acting was great.  I don't know, I really liked all the components a lot (acting, color usage, plot, style/editing), but it ended up being just a ""B"" for both me and my wife, and I'm not sure I can put my finger on why that is (and I love Del Toro so it isn't a genre thing).  Partially because I think it was sandwiched in between TLJ the night before I watched it (which I am apparently the only one who loved it, I gave it a 10/10 easily) and Three Billboards the night after, which I would give an A, so it may only be guilty of not comparing to two of my absolute favorite movies of the year.",7llz2i

drnk4vi,"One of the themes I took from this is we had a cast of characters who were pretending to be things they aren’t. 

Michael Shannon puts on this mask of a decent family man; perfect little house and family, driving around a fancy new Cadillac to present the image of someone he isn’t. Because at his core, he’s just a nasty little man who gets off on controlling others (quite literally, in once case).  He’s desperate to convince even himself that he’s a winner, but even his own fingers betray him. 

The Russian guy is obviously pretending to be someone else, in that he’s a spy; but he’s also presenting a false image of himself to his Russian cohorts. He’s not some battle hardened loyal soldier at all. He’s just a softie who wants to protect the weird water guy, and literally gets caught with his pants down. His comrades have guns, he’s hiding a butter knife behind his back. 

Giles is a closeted gay man who’s forced to portray the role of someone else. He wears a hairpiece and loves creating these fantasy worlds through his art. Unfortunately for him, reality doesn’t want what he has to offer. He wants to draw beautiful advertisements, but the world wants real life photographs. But what’s more real—the drawings, or the posed photos?

We see the same theme in other minor characters as well, such as the pie man who puts on a phony, folksy accent but is really a racist from Toronto. 

Ironically enough, the character who’s most true to herself is the one who can’t talk. ",7llz2i

drp2q0h,"I felt that a running theme throughout the movie is conformity.

The Asset, Eliza, Zelda, Giles, Dimitri are all outsiders in some way (monster, mute, black, gay, communist), and they oppose Strickland, who personifies the stereotypical white American male values and beliefs during the Cold War era.

To me the teal represented conformity while red was nonconformity. Strickland is a “conformist” in that he is driven to succeed and be a decent man in America. The teal car attracts him because someone tells him that it represents success. His teal candy reminds him of the simpler times of his past and he obsessively consumes it to reinforce his belief that those times still exist. The research center is teal everywhere, as are all the workers, all there to support aerospace development to help America become the most dominant force in the entire world, especially over the Russians.

Red to me represents rebellion/nonconformity. Some examples: Eliza’s shoes/headband, the desire for green pie instead of red pie with Giles art, the cop lights tinting Zelda and Giles red as they look down at the dock, and the Russians and the “red scare.”

The Russians in particular convey an anti-American way of seeing society, which ties back to the conformity/nonconformity theme. All the characters live in a world that is dominantly teal, almost like they are submerged in the ocean. In the end, everyone is forced to live in the world they are presented with, and must conform to it just as the shape of water conforms to its container. Ultimately, the “outsiders” reveal themselves in blood red in the teal world.",7llz2i
drnbv09,"The color palette was beautiful! I definitely noticed the emphasis on green and felt there were some possible contrasts with the color red as well (Giles's red jello ad being rejected because green was the ""future"", Elisa's hairband change from green to red, the scene when she's on the bus and windows are reflecting red/green) but maybe I'm reading into it too much haha

Can't wait to see what others have to say too.",7llz2i
drrmo03,"The color green = future... this was emphasized throughout the film (at least three times). “Green is the future!”

Red (I believe) = love. 

My theory: green represents the future people predicted. There are several characters who emphasize this: the security guard was persuaded to buy the green car because it was “the future color of driving machines”. The advertisement agency turned down Giles the first time because the jello wasn’t green. Once again, the future is green. Red is out. 
In reality, green was very much a color of their time (literally), as were their mindsets. The characters who emphasize green the most were oppressive, bigoted, cruel people... but they were very much a product of their time. They assumed, incorrectly, that they would determine the future. They would always have control. That things would remain the same: green. 
In reality, the color that triumphed (in the end) was the color that all the protagonist/kind principle characters wore at some point: red. All of these characters were loving, strong, open-minded people. Red, the color of love, is the future. 
In other words, the world will become a better place in time because love always triumphs in the end.

I believe the film was a very strong current social commentary.

The fish man was portrayed so humanistically that I didn't really consider him as an animal once their relationship became sexual (even though that scene with the cat definitely pushes fish man towards the animalistic than the humanistic).

I saw their relationship a lot more along the lines of the themes of, as you mentioned, ""what is love anyway?"" I felt that through and through this is a movie that pushes the boundaries of what we define as love. It asks us, wholeheartedly, to examine what and why we tolerate as love, and what we do not tolerate as love. Where do we draw the line and where? Your ideas probably fit in to these questions too. And I think Giles as a character serves a lot of purposes (including pointing to themes of sexuality). The movie is really concerned with insiders/outsiders so I got a lot of undertones about queer love.

They definitely do fall in love rather quickly, but I suppose that's part of the ""fairy-tale"" of it all. But that shouldn't be a catch-all for the movie's faults.

P.S. My favorite play is ""The Goat, or Who is Sylvia?"" by Edward Albee and it's about a guy who has an affair with a goat. The play's run-time is mostly spanned between a conversation between his wife and him. The language is so smart, it's hilarious, and honestly explores love and loss really well.

I enjoyed this movie and will recommend it to friends. However within the first few minutes I couldn't help but think of the movie ""Amelie"". The music was VERY similar, so was the colour pallet and surreal ""fairy tale"" feeling. The main characters also look similar and are quiet, isolated women with small voices who are friends with their older artsy painter neighbor. Amelie does a better job of having the two main leads slowly fall for each other  while this movie was more about being ostracized and fighting against ""the man"".

Your argument about the jello is perfect. 

The subtext of the film seems to be the baddies wish to remain isolated and preserve the arbitrary lines set down by society while the goodies wish to dismantle these lines and connect. The entire jewel tone colour scale in the film from the emerald, to topaz, to ruby and amethyst create a fairy tale ambience out of 1960s baltimore.

I get that the asset repeats certain gestures back to her, but overall I thought it was pretty obvious he showed genuine semblances of care and affection for her, and I don’t see any point in playing that aspect of the story as ambiguous.

The only ambiguous aspect of the film was its ending.

Edit: on second thought, that’s an interesting interpretation because it makes Elisa’s forbidden love more tragic. I still don’t think it entirely works since from my memory the Asset shows a fairly advanced level of emotions, but this will definitely be on my mind when I give the film a rewatch.",7llz2i
drn8swr,"I really like your interpretation of this. Having both main character be mute but for different reasons was really an amazing element of the story. Only through Elisa’s expressiveness can we feel her love for Mermaid Man ^^^and ^^^Barnacle ^^^Boy, and we’re left to hope that his physicality in turn implies reciprocation. Also holy shit, this movie was shot and scored exquisitely. What I would give to see the world through Del Toro’s eyes, if even for a day.",7llz2i
ds46ouo,"I agree on the ambiguity. Is he responding like a pet or like an equal being? A wild animal, or an intelligent being that just doesn't know the language and ways of the people around him? I think that's kind of the point. The film never answers the question as to the asset's actual intelligence, or emotions. It doesn't even really address it. It's just a lurking question. Giles treats him as a cared for pet that can't be blamed for acting like an animal, in the lab he's treated as a dangerous and malevolent wild animal, and Eliza treats him as an equal. All of these perceptions are reinforced in some way by the asset. 

When you think of other beauty and beast type stories, the point where the relationship becomes real/acceptable is when the beast character starts acting ""human."" But should it work that way? Is it really some sort of kindness that one will give the ""beast"" an opportunity to prove themselves and then maybe if the beast is convincingly conforming to everyone else, maybe she'll like them? Eliza does not set a prerequisite. She treats the asset as an equal immediately and chooses to believe that is true. 

The movie left me with those two big takeaways (in general terms)

That an ""other"" is likely to meet the expectations of those around them, good and bad. 

That perhaps it does not make us wonderfully tolerant people if we require ""others"" to prove themselves equal before we will consider them so",7llz2i
drojfxa,Also interesting is that Strickland seems to base his entire idea of power around controlling the voices of others.

[If Giles was a straight man he would have the possibility of not being alone. But establishing him being gay - and later him being shut down by pie guy - they establish a sense of empathy between him and Elisa.
When we see Strickland's house, at one point with see his wife with a green gelatin. Strickland's family is the family of Giles painting. The perfect american family - it makes it so we know Strickland will never understand Elisa because he is at the peak of priviledge.

The heroine is a romantic that's willing to believe in magic because the real world sucks. The villain is defeated by those he least expects to matter - lowly female servants, plus an educated man with a conscience who gets shot in cold blood.

In Labyrinth, the heroine is complex - she's a bit selfish and weak and has to struggle; in the end, she sacrifices herself in defiance. In Shape, the heroine is simplistic - she doesn't make mistakes (except stupidly writing the secret escape plan down), everything basically works out in her favor, she gets killed, but is resurrected by her love to a happy end.

And the mute girl who loves to boil eggs and masturbate and hang out in a ridiculously cool loft apartment with her socially awkward gay best friend. 

The more I think about it, the more this movie is trash. If Sally Hawkins character was not mute I bet that critics would have thought this was trash as well.

That being said, this movie would have worked well in the hellboy universe where you know it’s just a comic that doesn’t take itself seriously.

We are hit over the head with Elisa's apartment representing some kind of underwater haven (the opening shots literally depicting this, and green light often coming in and reflecting through her big window). 

What I am most puzzled by is the car, and the antagonist being inside of it for a little scene. I kept thinking ""this guy is symbolically underwater right now but I can't for the life of me figure out why.""

My best guess is that it represents everyone's home or where they belong. Whereas the antagonist's home was all bright and yellow, and he was clearly uncomfortable being there and talking to his kids and making love to his wife, it was driving down the road in his happy green car (and being completely silent) that he seemed most content and at peace.

He was similarly pretty comfortable in that green bathroom, where he was totally himself and carefree going to the bathroom with no hands and talking down to the cleaners, and which is also the place he refound himself and got his resolve to not fuck up again.

The red torture chamber area was a place that literally everyone seemed uncomfortable.

The painter obviously yearned for the diner guy and his green pies. The antagonist found some peace with his candy.

ds4b83r,"That is a very good question, too much to be a coincidence. One thing I know about this film is that it has layers and I absolutely can't wait to watch it again. One of the most moving films I have seen this year after Coco, and I hope it wins best picture at the Golden Globes even though I haven't seen the The Post yet(which if it is as good as people say it is has the potential to change my life, I say that somewhat jokingly but I am very into politics and still and respect wapo now. 

Now that you mention it, I think I figured it out as I am writing this. I am aware the actors involved are all incredible I just don't know their names. The old man creates ""one of the best works of his life"" as an advertisement for jello. The key is in that discussion and associating with the ad executive, saying we want green not red and he wants them happier, then the older main actor asks ""why are they happy"" among other questions. I think it was the third scene with Michael Shannon's family that it clicked that he was the target audience of the ad, and mirrored the ad's family, he has a daughter, son, blonde wife who is a the ""stereotypical trophy wife"" of that time. 

(Side thought, just had another thought, I think the overall color palette is supposed to represent love as well, tone is created by having common colors throughout every scene or colors that compliment one another) 

Back to that that specific relationship/symbolism between shannon and the **advertisement**. Shannon says he doesn't like green, but when green is repackaged into something materialistic and flashy he can accept that his new car is teal. He is lying to himself, just like the people in the ad are, because they aren't as happy as the ad depicts them as. Even when the old man changes the color of the jello and makes the family more happy(more fake), the ad executive still turns him away. 

I don't recall the color of the dress of shannon's wife, but if it were red, that would connect many dots for this interpretation. 

The color green I think serves two purposes, that narrative one I just detailed, and the tone that affects the viewer's mind on a subconscious level when you look at green and shades of it for 2 hours(like David Lynch and others' color palettes). There easily could be more though, it could serve the third which I touched on in the beginning which is that it represents real love. The color of the pies also ads to that, when the old man gets his heart broken is not eating the green pie. 

Very few films make me want to want them again immediately after, I hardly doubt The Post can compete, since The Shape of Water seems to use the medium of film in every way possible to affect the viewer and communicate real stuff. ",7llz2i

My thoughts exactly. I kinda got the feeling they never went through and read their first draft of the screenplay - just piled more on until the run time was enough and then went into production (albeit a gorgeous one with a fascinating concept). I really wanted to like this film and went to the theatre to see it, something I rarely do.

Fine, no problems there, but waving themed flags does not automatically add up to a satisfying, touching story.

I think it's always gotten the shaft.  Rare are the movies where the plot actually hangs together, particularly in genre film.  That's one of the things I think was so shocking about the original Matrix.  I think directors are more going after a huge visual experience or interesting character interactions; story is secondary.  

Look how many people are so in love with Bladerunner 2049.  That has so many inconsistencies and the premise doesn't make much sense when you think about it for even a few minutes, but mood, visuals, character interaction = awesome for some people.

I saw it last night and I did enjoy it, but at no point did I see why it is nominated for ""best picture"" - although, that said, I think a lot of the movies nominated for best picture are pretentious and overhyped. I'd rather watch this a dozen times over than see most of them, so I have no problem if it won the Oscar.  Perhaps my problem was I went in with too many expectations.

I will say though, the entire group I saw this with didn't expect all the nudity.  We all found it incredibly jarring - probably because it looked from the trailers to be in the same style as Hellboy 1/2 (just more drama, less action).  So when she took off her clothes and started masterb*ting within the first 5 minutes we were all like, ""I thought this was supposed to be like Beauty & Beast, but where Belle's a fishman?""

I think all that sex / nudity was unneeded and spoiled the movie.  Visually it was stunning, well acted, fantastic sets, and the story (while basic) had the charm of a new age fairy tale. It felt like they were attempting to make a classic, but at some point decided to go cult and edgy instead, and shove in needlessly nudity to jump on the Games of Thrones 'everything needs sex' band wagon.

dviy52j,"I think this movie was riddled with Oscar-bait elements to offset all of the brief nudity/sexuality/violence: 

- Period setting.

- Main character with disability.

- Frequent classic Hollywood references (TV Clips, movie theater clips).

- A movie theater features very prominently in the movie.

- A song and dance sequence with the main characters.

dvvud9x,"The modern Oscar bait movie imo doesn’t exist anymore. Or at least the academy doesn’t want to project that anymore. The real Oscar bait movies are more progressive movies. You can see this with the way the oscars are being presented. They’re getting backlash from the oscars so white and me too movements that they supposedly added more diverse members than just the perceived old white guys. They say look best director has been won by a Mexican director for like 4 years in a row. Moonlight, 12 years a slave won best picture. Look we’re progressive! This movie has a mute woman as lead. With her gay and black best friends all being hunted and persecuted by an evil white male...that’s baiting. ",7llz2i
dwxqtht,"No one thinks it isn't well made. Visually, it's perfect. It's the story, the characters, the writing, that are the issue. At times it feels like a movie they would show to elementary kids in school, because the characters are so purely (cartoonishly) evil or purely good, and to teach moral lessons (the diner scene: ""homophobia"" and racism are bad). The black woman complaining about her husband all the time (it feels like she's scolding all husbands for not helping around the house and not being grateful). Those sort of unsubtle messages all over the place.

Add to that the nostalgia exploitation (shameless I would say), which as The Artist showed us, Hollywood is a sucker for. The romance is very forced, and there are a few plotholes.

So it's a heavily nostalgic movie about a disabled woman, a black woman, a gay man, and a Russian (non US-citizen) scientist (intellectual) fighting against a white heterosexual male in a position of power, who displays every possible negative trait (they might as well have called him Agent Donald). It was directed by a Mexican. Given Hollywood's current politicized state, this movie is the definition of Oscar bait. All those awards were Hollywood backpatting itself and sending a political message. Just look at the faces of people in the audience when the movie won. A purely emotional reaction to a purely emotionally motivated award.

The parent of that unruly person got very angry with me, it turns out that unruly person was their special ed son.

Me and the parent then collapsed into a screaming match across the theater, I told her she should be at home with her kid.

The manager had to calm us down, and the movie resumed (they had to pause it). I was so shaken by the experience, I couldn't focus much.

It seems a lot more concerned with pushing our definition of what love is and the boundaries we put on it, what we tolerate and what we don't.

He's only unlikable because he's supposed to be unlikable - he has no real goal throughout the film other than to kill The Asset, and to be frank, I don't know why he kept The Asset if he wanted to kill it the entire time.

A great villain actually has depth, motivation and complexity while also being relatable and intimidating.

She was a little impulsive and nebbish, but not qualities you would associate with a mental condition short of her muteness.  She planned the whole escape that should have taken a 10 person russian team to pull off.

I personally gave it a 7 - I wasn't impressed by anything, but it was a perfectly harmless adult fairy tale, the acting was quite wonderful, and it was tonally consistent all the way through.  I personally would never bother rewatching it, but it's worth a watch, especially if your expectations are low.

The Oscar hype is kinda ridiculous for it.  I've seen all of the noms so far short of Darkest Hour and Call Me By Your Name, and can say I definitely think Dunkirk, Phantom Thread, Ladybird, Three Billboards and Get Out are *much* better films (I'd go Ladybird, Get Out, Dunkirk, Phantom Thread and Three Billboards if you put a gun to my head).  I'd say the only film this one beats is The Post.  

Weirdly enough though, I thought Richard Jennings was fantastic in this and really evoked a lot of empathy for the neighbor character.  Were he not against such other powerhouses (Willem Dafoe, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell) this year, I'd be rooting for him.  But I'll be rooting for Willem.

So I just can't get behind [having sex with it. Ultimately, that's no different than having sex with your dog or dolphin trainers getting too frisky with their dolphins. It may look humanoid, but it isn't. It's not a fairy tale like Beauty and the Beast-- that beast was a human transformed.](#spoiler).

Like other of GDT's films, it's too long. There are elements that drag on or go nowhere. Shannon's sudden infatuation with Eliza? Or that awkward gay flirtation moment? Almost like the movie wants to pretend it's this big statement about prejudice but that falls apart on closer inspection. Did we need to see her daily masturbation routine? What did that add?

Why didn't fish man just eat the fingers???

I think the films about stories and their ability to inspire. Giles might have been the creator of this particular story.

Sally Hawkins does not purposely manipulate this creature into loving her or having sex with her. Yes there is interspecies love but the unethical nature of it is removed based on what we know about the ""creature"" I think. I will like to add to this comment that I don't view any other animal that currently exists as something that can consent and be aware enough to have relations with ethically. 

The creature has been known to be a god and worshiped where he is from, yet he has been lonely his entire life. Who knows how long he or it existed. Both the creature and Sally Hawkins are viewed as misunderstood souls who can't and haven't been appreciated by other souls. We of course are supposed to view ourselves as Sally Hawkins, the ""flawed human"" pursing love with a person who understands us and respects us for we are.

The creature is an allegory for an innocent outsider/minority that is abused by absolute power. Elisa has a poignant scene where she tells Giles that if she does not save the creature, she is just as guilty as those who carry out the crime. I believe this is the ultimate message of the movie, whether it be related to refugees, the holocaust, Vietnam, etc. 

Although it is interesting that the only people willing to risk it all are those with nothing to lose, I think the protagonists deal more with a shared empathy than a feeling of non acceptance. They have not lived easy lives. Elisa, Zelda, and Giles are all outcasts who by merely being who they are, are an affront to society. They share these scars, and feel the pain of the creature. Without this empathy, the creature (an allegory for any abused minority IMO) is left to die. And this will be the fate of all creatures without people like the protagonists.

- The cat. It's not just that there was no guilt, it's that I have trouble understanding how it advanced the plot at all. When it happened, I thought it was the proof that Giles was correct: in spite of his sensibility, the merman is not civilized and people should be cautious around him. I found it in poor taste and contradictory to the other traits lent to him (high sensibility and empathy), but the most unbelievable about that is: what does Elisa do with that bit of info? She decides to fuck the merman. Without so much as a word from Giles when he finds out to point out how dangerous they found out the merman to be. All the cat's death does is serve as comic relief when we see the merman petting the other cats and Giles tells him not to play with the kitties.

- Strickland suffers a fate worse than no character advancement: he's a 80's-90's cliche vilain ""no depth, all tropes"". He's the embodiment of an heterosexual white patriarchal figure, a careerist and a sadist. Why? I guess because there had to be a contrast to the progressive values taught by the film? But as he doesn't learn, doesn't change, doesn't have any redeeming qualities, and doesn't act in a way that could in any way surprise us, I found him incredibly dull.

- I had to double-check with my wife as I was sure Strickland had to be driving a Leaf or a Prius, and not a Cadillac, given how silent his freaking car is. It's a V8 of the 60's, aren't these engines noisy as hell? And yet he proceeds to sneak up on the Russians, then on the main characters, with his car, even though they knew he was after them. 

- Elisa's scars/gills were a pretty obvious Chekhov's gun, but at least I was hoping there would be a meaning or a twist to it. Seeing that particular gun fire in the last two minutes of the movie without any context given other than ""yeah so she's a mysterious orphan found near a river"" left me sorely disappointed.

dv513m7,"in the third act of the movie I kept thinking to myself ""how is a movie with an absolutely insane story so predictable?""

I don't necessarily mean this in a bad way because I love theme parks, but it felt like being in a fully immersive ride at Disney or Universal where every little detail of the universe has been thought out - not just in the ride itself but even when you're waiting in line. It feels so magical and whimsical and expertly crafted but they're not telling a story, they're just putting you in that place.

It was like that for me, but with immediate masterbation.",7llz2i

dt8xzhe,"Okay, I just saw it and I have a few things to say that I also found unnecessary while I was watching but thought what they represented. To anyone reading this, there are some spoilers ahead. Bear with me: the central theme is loneliness, that's pretty straight forward.

Elisa is mute and has her scars which makes everyone look at her as a weirdo or even not as smart/clever as she is. Zelda has no family other than her husband, who doesn't even talk to her; and you know, she's a black woman in the 60's. Giles is a closeted homosexual, and as he said, maybe he was too soon for his sexual preference to be accepted and born too late, because his job is becoming obsolete. Then there's Dimitri, the 'spy', a russian living among Americans in the midst of the Cold War. The Asset, of course, was venerated in South America and brought to a lab to be examined. 

The antagonist, Strickland, is also alone, but not because of the circumstances of the world like the rest of the characters. He's the only one who isolates himself because he thinks he's far superior. He has a nice house, healthy kids, a wife who is very much glad of some happy time with him, his subordinate idolizes him, and yet he's not happy, he's greedy and enjoys torturing a fishman in his free time.

There is more than what meets the eye here in this movie which is why I really liked it. I understand the price it's getting, there's some cheese here and there and it's not perfect, but it was a nice uplifting tale with enough flare and Del Toro's style to charm me.",7llz2i
dt6y29m,"> And now, what's she going to do with her life?

I think she's dead, and that last scene is just Giles imagining they lived happily ever after. ",7llz2i
dt6ipus,"Agreed about Elisa's life seeming fine.  I'm typically abled, but I'm in graduate school for education and doing a lot of readings from differently abled communities right now and that perspective affected my viewing of the film. I was cringing at the idea that he would 'cure' her muteness, as I know I've read a lot of differently abled critique of films where people are defined by their disability and their only redemption is to cure it.  My understanding is that's not an ideal representation, as it implies differently abled people are defined only by what they lack, and once they gain it, they begin to be more fully human.  A deaf man may retort ""no, my deafness is a facet of me but does not define me"" but at the same time, may resist cochlear implants as his deafness is integral to his life.  (there's a compelling documentary about this called sound and fury about parents debating whether or not to get cochlear implants for their child).

I don't think the film treated Elisa's muteness like this per se.  But it seemed that the only thing that was sad about her life was her muteness.  But the film didn't go out of it's way to make that sad.  It just sort of assumed that the audience would think a mute person was sad and needed some more pizazz in their life.  But you're right, she seemed perfectly happy.  Now her two friends who needed her are short one person.",7llz2i
dt6ux2h,"You point out a lot of ""Chekov's guns"" in the story, which I noticed, too, while watching. They're so frustrating. (see my paste below) These types of threats-or-foreshadowing-that-come-to-nothing moments feel sloppy and misleading to the viewer. Del Toro is good at some things, but from what I've seen in Crimson Peak and The Shape of Water, he has a long way to go before mastering feature storytelling. This film felt like a proof-of-concept or the Act I of a better, more interesting narrative.

""Anton Chekhov, a Russian author and playwright (and doctor) is often considered a master storyteller. The term “Chekhov’s gun” comes from a bit of advice Chekhov shared with other writers. In an 1889 letter to playwright Aleksandr Semenovich Lazarev, Chekhov wrote:

*One must not put a loaded rifle on the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.*

This concept is fleshed out a bit in Memoirs, in which S. Shchukin quotes Chekhov as saying this:

*If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on a wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it’s not going to be fired, it shouldn’t be hanging there.*

**Chekhov is warning against extraneous detail.** A gun is a looming image. It’s full of meaning; it has the potential for danger and death. To give it attention is a signal to readers that they should pay attention. If nothing comes of it, readers can feel duped. Every detail must have purpose. If you give something significance early in the story, follow through on it.

Of course, Chekhov wasn’t referring to guns only. That image stands in for a larger concept. The “gun” could be any detail, be it an object, a setting, or even a circumstance. 

**Details have power. They can create meaning and expectation, whether you intend them to or not. If you don’t pay close attention, a misplaced or misleading detail can destroy the reading experience.** ""

dtd4sy2,"Old Hollywood shit? Of course it would not be a film for you to enjoy if you don't enjoy old movies in general, otherwise how can you say it is off-putting? To each their own, it is fine if you don't like old movies or this movie- but you have to go into it understanding that you're not supposed to judge it by how believable the plot is- I mean by whether it is realistic expression of the real world. Like it wasn't made to be judged on plot twists and character motivations.

When you watch a musical, you don't ask ""Um why are all these people belting out a tune whenever something happens?"" and this is because we understand and accept that it represents a heightened, magical world which is not like our realistic world. It's an escape into a different, more interesting, more beautiful place. You wouldn't understand the sentimentality behind how those cutaways to scenes from old movies and TV shows relate to the movie, but also speak to the people out there with a love for old cinema and being able to relate with Elisa's joy and love for film and jazz. Also for example, the end of Lala Land, the fantasy sequence done in an aesthetic that will remind the audience about the movie An American in Paris- it isn't put there to further the plot but it's put there to depict the feeling of bittersweet longing- not only does it remind the audience of the Gene Kelly movie but it's an emotional experience, of that familiar feeling of wishing things could've been different with a past lover and wondering what if they had been. It's shown so that we as the audience can experience how the characters feel.

The Shape of Water is not for the cynics it is for the hopeless romantics who have a fondness for past whimsical old classics and jazz. You aren't supposed to be critiquing the plot on its plausibility- it's many genres- mainly fantasy and more about the feelings that it evokes- on longing, feeling incomplete and defective, until something comes along that makes you feel normal for once. It doesn't need to make sense logically as to why she falls for the creature. She just does, we accept that and we are along for the ride- the film portrays the actual feeling of falling in love through it's imagery combined with the music and Sally Hawkins is amazing- Like with the scene where she imagines herself belting out the tune ""You'll Never Know"" and then we go into her imagination and she is Ginger Rogers and the creature is Fred Astaire- the pain and longing of not being able to sing your heart out and express yourself- it is so bittersweet. The whole film Sally Hawkins is endearing and acts brilliantly without speaking. It doesn't need to make sense, it's not made to make sense, it is simply a pastiche to post-war monster films and classic Fred Astaire musicals. So if you don't like old Hollywood shit and find all that corny, this all would fly over your head. 

This wasn't just a reply to you though :) sorry if I sound very defensive, it's not like I think this was the best movie ever made- I love cheesy old movies in general and movies that remind me of them and yet again I am just very surprised on how people on here don't seem to like it that much, but their rationale is because they judge it on parameters that a movie like this wasn't built to do well in (the director and screenwriter knows it's a weird concept)- so even though the plot isn't more ""advance"" or wouldn't make sense in real life, and even if they didn't give enough screen time in showing why she falls in love with the creature, the plot is actually good because of what the director is trying to accomplish. It also baffles me when people say old films suck because they are black and white or that it looks unrealistic with the tech they had back then- but that's another story, I probably would have liked this film even if the monster looked like a bad suit. And even if they showed more scenes of how they start falling in love, I still think it would not make sense why she wants to be with the creature logically- she just chooses this. It wasn't a movie built to make sense or not be cliche (even though the idea of the creature, specifically one like the creature from the black lagoon actually getting the girl isn't, and it doesn't fit neatly under one genre). The people behind the movie succeeded in what they wanted to achieve, bringing back memories and the nostalgia of watching a classic film. It is sort of like a fanfiction thing for the director as well in making the monster end up with the girl, like if the phantom of the opera or if King Kong ended up with the girl-
 very weird in concept but it wound up being a beautiful art piece to many. **The director has also said in an interview he wanted to make a proper melodrama- they aren't known to be very realistic. Definition: a sensational dramatic piece with exaggerated characters and exciting events intended to appeal to the emotions. So knowing this, he created exactly what he was aiming to create.**",7llz2i

But the way it was shown was gratuitous and uncomfortable. I felt like I was spying on someone in the bathroom and not in a way that served the plot. I think that scene could have been cut or shown off-camera and still captured the intent without objectifying Eliza.

Also, if we are going to see full frontal nudity anyway, why not show the merman’s genitalia? At least that would answer a question that all the viewers in the movie (and Zelda’s character) actually had about the mechanics. 

 Considering the meta message about racism and homophobia in the film, it’s ironic the filmmaker was sexist in how he approached the sex scenes.",7llz2i

Got downvoted to hell for claiming that trailers can reveal major plot details and spoil a movie yet this one did exactly that.

I new the film would center around romance, but I don't agree with the common sentiment that because a moment isn't surprising or It's predictable, It's automatically underwhelming. I knew the end was coming, and although It didn't hit with poignancy It did feel somewhat significant because of the way It played out.

dsjcost,"> I didn't buy the sexual chemistry between the creature and Elisa

That was probably the part I had the most problems with. It's a captive relationship, almost like Stockholm syndrome. I know if the creature were female people would see this criticism a lot more clearly. There needed to be something a little more developed between them.",7llz2i
drxg8pd,"I'm in total agreement with you here. I think the acting and directing were both really good, I just couldn't get down with Del Toro's screenplay. For a little bit, I was engaged with the idea that Elisa found someone who could understand her and their love would be a type of companionate love. But instead, all of the relationship building we got with her and the fish-man was them having sex. It was so over the top I could not engage with it. That sense of companionship was completely lost on me when they never really show the non-physical side of their relationship after the escape besides that one dinner. 

I also found Michael Shannon's character rather uncompelling. His motivations were torn between weird familial obligations and a sense of 'getting the job done.' Then his God-complex just got over-the-top at the end with his constant monologing. And then at the end he says, ""Maybe you are a god."" I was so exhausted with his character at this point I just rolled my eyes. It felt like Del Toro was punching me in the face saying ""Get it! This guy thinks he is a god among men! See!!!""

There were other small intricacies that I thought weren't done well. How she has clearly hours alone with the 'specimen' when Michael Shannon's sole purpose is to study it, and yet he is hardly there. How at the end, the fish-man is able to heal himself and everyone but can't seem to do that in the beginning of the movie. 

I don't know... I see the appeal of this film. Unique take similar to Pan's Labyrinth (which I loved) that combines lovely dark-colored tones with great directing and great acting. But the script was just lacking for me. ",7llz2i
drwhuj0,"I was talking to some people about why the plot and character arcs seemed so superficial and we came to the conclusion that Del Toro wanted to live within the stereotype of fairytale-fantasy. I think he stuck to a common story structure on purpose. Maybe it wasn't enough for you, and at some points it lagged for me, but I think you can appreciate the finesse. Still, some interesting surprises lived in the world, namely Dimitri teaming up with Elisa and Giles battling closeted homoerotic feelings.

I disagree with your opinion that the acting was adequate. I think Sally Hawkins was phenomenal and deserves best actress for this role. Michael Shanon was also fantastic. ",7llz2i
ds1v3nq,"I thought it was a brilliant film -- not just the unbelievably good performances, the cinematography, the design (including the fish-guy), but also thematically. That early-60s period was a crisis point for what you might call normal-American-white-guy-hegemony, which also included all the toxic masculinity so brilliantly represented in Shannon's performance (and the movie is not unsympathetic with him! Which I love. He is doing the best he knows how with the insane system he's been given, a system which has made a monster of him, and then [(in the shape of the General) disposes of him the first time he fails](#spoiler)). 

And then you see, living in the cracks of this ""normal""-hegemony, people who can never fit into it: a woman with a disability, a gay guy, a pure science nerd (which for the purposes of his motivation is more important that his being a Soviet spy). And you see how these cultural castoffs plot to save something they all recognize as sacred--something that involves love, something from deep in the ocean, something that does not fit the hierarchical, ultra-rational rigidity of the ruling culture. The Others save this sacred creature. Michael Shannon's final line--[""shit, you are a god""](#spoiler)--is so perfect.",7llz2i
dryg72n,"exactly what i was thinking, it was alright.  i didnt think much of this from the summary and trailers, looked like some weeb fishman fantasy shit.  but i respect del toro's work a lot, he has a great flair for the fantastical, and it was getting rave reviews on reddit and everywhere so ill bite (eheheheh).

the plot seems like your basic star-crossed lovers with one dimensional motivations from both parties involved - michael shannon is your typecast hardline bigoted g-man, while the others think the fishman is cool and its wrong to punish him because hes different.  a thing i noted is that the guys on the fishmans side are all the ""subversive"" elements of american society as they would be seen - the disabled, black, gay, russian commies.  so its a literal us vs. them social issue, and the movie seems very on the nose about this

another thing i couldnt get past is how much the fishman resembles abe sapien.  all credit to doug jones for his performance (and staying in his suit for almost a day), but we already saw him do this, and with a far more interesting character.  

all in all, a nice movie with some neat fantastical scenes, but the middling narrative and pace bring it down.  the MVP of the whole cast was her neighbor Giles",7llz2i

I am biased towards Shannon and I did adore seeing him almost reprise his role as Broadwalk Empire's Van Alden, but he's not necessarily playing the bad guy, he's more her polar opposite and sort of the co-main character. I was pulling for her and fishman to live, but it was also satisfying when Colonel Strickland was wreaking havoc and getting answers - like how we found ourselves rooting for Heath Ledger's Joker.

As a fairy tale set in reality, a period piece, and a love letter to Hollywood, it masterfully hits all its notes. It's ending is only cliche in that it repeats Pan's Labyrinth: the girl dies and is reborn in another world, lost to the people who knew and loved her before.

 The reason they wanted to kill the Asset (fish creature) was because they knew it could breath both in and out of water.

They believed that they could find a way to use the knowledge on how the Asset breathed to help them in space. Being not needing as much air or maybe not needing it at all. 

 In order to do this they wanted to open him up while he was still alive. In order to see how it is that he breathes and how to replicate it for the space race. The Soviets didn't want this though so they told there agent to go and kill it, because then it wouldn't be able to breathe and America would be left with a corpse. However there agent instead freed it.

 The film was about isolation. The characters are all outcasts in some way. They are minority's. We have a disabled person, a homosexual and a black person. So the Old man was there to further this theme and to help along the plot as well as be the main characters friend.

drt7bza,"> Elisa can totally just walk into that maximum security room where there are no cameras

There were cameras in the room.  One of the plot points in the movie was Elisa moving the camera so it wouldn't be pointed towards where it could see her take fishman out.  Now why she was able to always be in there idk, perhaps it was pointed in a way that showed just the pool but not much else.

>  I guess his only resort is to help Elisa break a mermaid out of a maximum security government facility.

No it wasn't his only resort but it has been established at this point in the movie that despite the fight they both had they were good friends that stuck together.  It was only natural Jenkins character would reconcile with her.  Also, this movie took place in the 60's.  I think it was pretty hard back then to simply find another guy to hit on.  It's suggested that he has always been a loner and its' likely pie guy wasn't the first he tried to hit on, perhaps at this point he has given up on finding true love.  His conversation with the fishman further states his loner hood and difficulty being gay.

> The whole creepy Strickland hitting on Elisa thing was so pointless and added absolutely nothing to the movie.

It added to his character as a man interested in woman as merely sex objects rather than actual people.  Thus he was extra interested in Elisa because she is unable to voice her opinions unlike his wife.  He simply wants control and no opposition.

> Elisa's plan to get the fish man out would have never fucking worked if Hoffstetler hadn't showed up with the key to his chains

Aren't the keys left in the room?  I thought I saw a key rack at some point in the movie.  If not perhaps she had a side plan of where to get them.

> Really, like nobody would care about the actual DEAD HUMAN MAN who Hoffstetler stuck with the needle?! 

I doubt it's that no one cares rather no one wants to reveal that information because it would show how much of a massive failure the organization was at keeping secrets like the fishman out of the public.

I agree with your second last point though, I didn't understand why he would give them up since he knew he was dying.  Perhaps he felt it was going to be a slow death if he didn't reveal the info and didn't want to suffer more.

As for sex with a fish guy he was more than just a fish guy, the movie repeated he was a god and also the ending reveals that Elisa was originally a fishwoman, he just restored her gills that were sewn up.  So it wasn't really sex with another species as they were both the same.

drstu6r,"I'm a huge fan of ""out there"" stories and this movie just fell flat to me. I thought the character development was seriously lacking and I've seen better developed relationships in rom-coms than I found the Elisa-fish man relationship to be. It progressed very quickly from her first sneaking into his tank room to them having this strong connection and it didn't seem like an organic growth that we got to feel or experience at all. It felt more like the movie was just telling us they had grown close, and as a result I didn't feel any emotional investment into the relationship between them. I think it would have been much better served putting more time into establishing and showing the growth of their connection. I found Dimitri and her neighbor to be much better developed and much more likable than either Elisa or the fish man. The cat eating scene definitely didn't help either in making the fish man likable.

2. They probably know about a certain healing power. They don't care. They're more concerned about the Russians not finding it (and maybe hopeful that a vivisection would be too much for it to heal of).
3. Cameras in 1960 had tapes, which (for what we see in the movie about them being not so great with security) probably weren't that hard to steal. In the wrong hands, they're evidence of a government secret project.
4. Rivers can have salty water, in fact there's an Argentine river called ""Salty River"" because it's close to the sea and waters mix (there's a ""Sweet River"" too, but in the middle of the country and nowhere near the Atlantic Ocean).
5. Leaps happen when a story develops during days or weeks but you have only 120 mins of movie runtime.
6. I agree it seems a bit off topic, but the subplot doesn't take much movie time and I think it's there to explain that Elisa and him are friends, why they aren't attracted to each other, why the guys is so lonely and weird, etc. 
7. Sewing fingers back doesn't always work, specially if you are a smoker or have bad blood circulation. Maybe it's because Shannon's character is rotten as a person. Maybe it was just an infection because he doesn't wash his hands after using the bathroom. Does it matter?

dv67go9,"To your frst point you ask what the pay off of her scars are and then continue to mention the pay off which is her getting gills from them. I fail to see how that is a problem considering the movie does have pay off relating to that plot point. 

 Nothing really suggested she was related to the creature in any way. I don't see how a Spanish name could factor into her being related to the fish monster.

 On the second point. They explain how they want to use his longs to get to space. When it comes to the Asset healing it's possible he didn't want to reveal his powers to the army, that way they won't hurt him as much.

 To the third point it would be foolish to but a camera in the room. Firstly all the cameras are visible to Michael Shannon so anyone who enters would be able to see it. So that would be a pretty big problem.

 It's made clear throughout the film that the military look down on the cleaners. They don't suspect them if doing anything against them throughout the film. As such it makes sense why they wouldn't put a guard there. The room has to be opened and closed at certain times so it's secure enough and they don't expect our leads to do anything but there job.

 To the fourth and fifth point I have seen that complaint many times and don't have a response to it. It is a fair point to make.

 The second to last point I believe it was to have us sympathise with the character more and understand him better.

dten3ti,"I think you’re missing the point of many of the plot devices. Take for example the old mans sexuality. It wasn’t to make us feel bad for him, it was to show that he too experienced judgement for his sexuality - it makes him sympathetic to the lead character, because he acknowledges love knows no bounds. 

The time period was important, a period of teals and aqua blues. This was a visual tool to reinforce the theme of water I believe, but it lended to the Russian spy subplot, as well as keeping it in a time where technology wasn’t as advanced as it is today - allowing for a simple mute cleaner to steal the beast. 

While I admit the sexual relationship made me uncomfortable because of the beasts pet-like characteristics, I suspect this was intentional. I would not liken it to fucking a dog. This was to remind the viewer that while others see him as an animal, she sees something more in him.

The black and white singing scene was her fantasy - it wasn’t for nostalgia, it was set apart from the rest of the films aesthetic because it was in her head. She wanted to express her love for him verbally, and that insight into her mind showed us that. 

The final scene where she grows gills I believe is intentionally fairy-tale esque, it’s so far from reality that it challenges the viewers suspense of disbelief. This leads me to think that the viewer is supposed to decide her true fate, whether she really grew gills and lived happily ever after, or if she actually died and that was her passing fantasy. 

Everything in the film has a purpose, and with a shallow analysis you might not pick it up straight away - but if you look a little deeper, you can connect the dots. I thought it was a great film, one of the best I’ve seen of late.

The only interesting thing about the ""meanie"" (haha) were the scenes with him and his family, especially with his wife (excluding the random sex scene). Other than that, it tried SO HARD to make us hate him, which just made me hate most of it.

It's like the screenwriters literally thought: ""He's racist!! He's misogynist too!! Oh, he's ableist! He's xenophobic too!! And he tortured the helpless amphibian guy!!!!! DON'T YOU GUYS HATE HIM NOW?"" (I rolled my eyes so hard during the torture scene I was afraid they'd get stuck.)

I'm *genuinely* surprised they didn't clumsily shove in a scene with him beating his wife and/or kids as a final nail. I guess THAT would be over the top? Ugh.

What a waste of Octavia Spencer and Michael Shannon--especially with the latter constantly being typecast as the cartoonishly evil/greedy/[insert negative quality here] villain when he's a genuinely great actor. And Spencer deserved a much more fleshed out role rather than just the funny black lady who helps the main white lady because her heart is just THAT pure. But she did the best with what she had, I guess.

Also, jesus christ, people describe Hawkins' acting as PHENOMENAL? 
1) She seemed way too overly quirky (I kept getting discount-Amelie vibes for whatever reason), and 2) had very few, if any, flaws (besides endearing ""flaws"" like curiosity or mischievous)... because her being mute is enough of a flaw to the screenwriters? 

The sex scene when she ""seduces"" him was somewhat disturbing (definitely not sweet or romantic in any capacity) because she essentially just climbs into the shower, naked, out of nowhere. Humanoid or not, there's no way to tell that he had any concept of what consent was or that he had any idea what was going on to begin with. The premise of exploring interspecies relationships is really interesting--don't get me wrong--but it's the execution of it that grossed me out. I mean, it's good because yay, it's depicting a woman taking control of her sexuality, but how does that excuse overlooking (or ignoring altogether) consent?

You're 100% right about the nostalgia too. I was so tired of it that by the weird couch-tap-dancing scene, I was ready to stab a straw through my eye. I'm not sure what we were supposed to react with during the black-and-white performance fantasy either. Were we supposed to get chills or cry?? I actually laughed at how ridiculous it looked and how out-of-place it was (besides as a callback to the contrived old movie clips).

There were so many moments throughout that made me think, ""This is only happening because the script says so"" rather than making narrative sense: 
""Hey, this unstable guy pretty clearly threatened to rape me the other day; he's also especially irate after having Doug Jones stolen. I REALLY need to express my triumph here, and smiling smugly and signing 'Fuck you' couldn't possibly end badly. Hardy har har, got you, Michael Shannon.""
or
""I woke up this morning and realized I don't even know what our relationship is, so I'm having a perfectly timed crisis about my personal life and my career! We can't be friends. ... Oh darn, I was not only rejected but humiliated by a guy working at the only diner in town. Did I mention the waiter was RACIST!??!?!?! Anyway, let's be friends again--forget everything I said before when I made you cry.""

It was implied he was gay and fired Richard Jenkins because of their relationship together (this is just my interpretation). He basically made it so Jenkins couldn't sell his work.

As for the nationalism, it wasn't anti-nationalism. It was opposed to *blind* nationalism. The scientist was willing to go against the Soviet's and risk his life for his beliefs.

drv4xe6,"I can see where you're coming from, but it depends on where you place the fishman on the fantasy world scale.  The point of the movie was that the creature was an intelligent humanoid, that he was more than just some animal.  Look at RPGs, you've got rule templates for things like half-elves, half-dwarves, half-dragons, and even half-demon/fiend.

The *animal* in question is not even a real *animal*. He resembles a man, and is hyper-intelligent. It's fantasy and it's a movie, so roll with the surrealism or just admit you don't jive with Del Toro. However, many films and novels have mythological creatures taking sexual interest in human counterparts. The Chronicles of Narnia is one example.

dv5xpzg,"So I believe this film is about being isolated. Being a minority. We follow characters who are mute, gay and black throughout. But we also see characters who are in the majority be isloted in some way.

 Strickland is one such character. He is the perfect nuclear family father, his family is the old cliche. Two parents and two kids, one boy, one girl. It's quite the cliche. We see his home life and it's what would be expected of such a family.

 However there is a problem. Strickland has some of his fingers bitten off. He's different now. By losing this part of himself isn't he now also isolated and in the minority? He loses what he believes makes him closer to God. 

 He reatches his fingers but they don't take. He is in denial of this, he ignores it, he thinks he can be normal. As he ignores what makes him different he has his differences worsen. Much like how someone who ignores they are I'll or gay it becomes more and more obvious to the casual observer.

 Around this stage Strickland develops a thing for Eliza. He fetishes her and it's something they both in a way have in common. They are both now different and disabled. He is rejected however.

 Strickland is eventually Fred to admit his differences and does so by ripping out his fingers. He now works to be accepted by doing his job well and attempts to hunt down Eliza and the Asset.",7llz2i

If he wash his hands the ""man smell"" will be gone.

The smelling part felt like the smell was to stimulate his wife sexually (she was feeling the ""man smell"").

Adding in the musical number was clearly charming to others but I found it really out of place and odd. 

In addition, I found the plots going on *around* the main plot to be more compelling than the main plot itself. I cared more about Giles than I did about Elisa. I felt like she was the side character in his movie and when it ended without real resolution for him, I was disappointed.

So back to my original question, that mentality doesn't accept a black/white relationship as it's seen as beneath one party or not compatible ""types of people"", etc. Perhaps Sally and Asset's relationship could be viewed as similarly ""incompatible"" with that close minded mentality.

dsvk731,"I seem to have misplaced my comment somehow but to answer your question...I felt like I never knew what kind of movie I was watching. I felt like this was a somewhat vulgar movie that was trying to sell itself as a love story/fairy tale and it simply did not work. Masturbation in the bath, nearly every word that came out of Michael Shannon's mouth, him pissing in the bathroom in front of the cleaning ladies.....I thought too much of the story was conveniently unbelievable. Like the fact that they just brought the creature into the lab while the cleaning ladies are hanging out and cleaning when Elisa initially sees the creature. Or how she was able to find so much alone time with the creature in a Top Secret laboratory. How about the fact that when she reveals to her friend that she had sex with the sea creature her friend barely bats an eyelash? All in all, I felt it would have been better served if certain things had been alluded to instead of being put right in your face in an over the top and unbelievable manner. My wife and I both said after seeing the movie that it felt like we'd been lied to after seeing the trailer. But hey, to each their own.",7llz2i

I'm afraid to frame it this way because del Toro is a storyteller who has earned his success for sure, and he's someone I look up too as a storyteller myself, but the film felt very amateurish in the way it told the story, almost like a child narrating this cool idea he has with a bunch of talented actors, cinematographers, etc, putting it together.  

Like, all his ideas in the movie were good, but they were so surface level that while I can see what he was *trying* to say and what he probably felt when creating these characters, I didn't myself see it - like a kid very enthusiastically telling you about a dream they had; you can tell by their energy what it meant to them and how deeply it affected them, but they lack the ability to communicate it to you in such a way that you feel it yourself, and so no matter how much you understand it you still feel very unengaged and outside of it all.",7llz2i

Jenkins could have continued to visit there and pathetically eat pie after being rejected if he had continued to apologize for being himself, but seeing the pie guy be racist finally opened his eyes up to what was the reality in front of him.

I do think it would have been more effective if Sally Hawkins didn't have such a rockin' bod.

dulilz2,"SPOILER WARNING

I don't have the time to go into depth but my main problems were first how the characters don't seem to develop at all throughout the film:

Antagonist: From the start he might seem intimidating but if you look carefully it's quite apparent how incompetent he is, which is quite important because the whole point is to show how incompetent he is in the end of the film. Look at who he is dominating through the entire film right from the start, his defenseless wife, the poor cleaners, the stupid security assistance, the trapped and unable to move creature. He never really is shown to have true power of any sort, I think Michael Shannon's performance was great so maybe people didn't notice how the character was quite bland.

This is just one example, but any character in the film does not develop in any interesting way, including the fish monster, the protagonist and everyone else. The only big change I see is how the good old scientist sells the protagonist out near the end of the film but that's not a development, it's really just out of his whole character after being shown as a kind person who'll do anything to protect the creature.

My second big problem is the focus of the film. The interesting theme of the movie, of falling in love with an alien is completely absent in the middle part of the movie. We meet the creature, protagonist plays a little with him, falls in love with him. Then a big chunk of time is designated to how they release the creature, which was also extremely not interesting mostly because our heroes were never in danger (they were actually never in danger throughout the entire film). Our incompetent antagonist brings them in for questioning, what happens? Nothing. He tries to catch them in the end of the film, what happens? Nothing, we already know he can't kill them or do anything to them because our sea creature has healing abilities because why not. Anyway after the whole action part of the movie, then we finally start seeing the romantic connection developing, but this is already one hour or so into the film.

I could go on for quite a bit of time, but these are the glimpses of why I think the script was mostly uninteresting and badly written. It feels like we started the film with a strive for a message, an emotion, a conflict, will they be able to be together? If so, how? Will they not? What's the true nature of this creature? Should humans bond with non-human beings?

We don't really get anything, they end up together because the creature has deux ex machina powers, we learn nothing about the creature expect that he's actually quite violent and wild (Rips throat out of antagonist, eats half a cat) and so he's not really human as the film makes him out to be. I've started the film with a feeling of balance that after 2 hours became a feeling of stagnation since nothing of importance happened.

dt6bd6w," In my experience these more nuanced subplots, especially the central love story, were undeveloped and crowded out by the action-ey espionage thriller aspect of the movie, which did absolutely nothing for me. If this movie was ever going to work it was going to have to be a love story, which it barely is. Elisa and the fish are only on screen together for like 10?? Or less minutes before they start fucking. And the entire reason for their love is like completely spelled out and explained with Elisa's monologue to her neighbor, rather than through their relationship. A woman falling in love with a half man half animal is really compelling but this movie didn't even seem interested in exploring that story at all.",7llz2i

dvypz2u,"I see this argument a lot for movies and games and novels, but I think it is flawed logic.

The thing is, yes, the material might be set in a fictitious world with fishmen with healing powers or space knights with laser swords and magic. However, there is a concept called literary realism, or something that is realistic in the fictional world they are trying to build. For example, Wolverine has superhuman healing powers in the Marvel Universe and this is plausible as it his part of the mutant storyline they are weaving. However lets say he spills his cup of coffee in the morning and it doesn't spill and stays in the cup magically. While this is not all the crazy compared to his healing powers, liquid behaving against the laws of physics(at least by itself) is not within he realm of fictional reality and thus shatters the viewers immersion in the universe. 

Same goes for this movie. We get its a fake story about a fake merman. But we have no reason to believe anything else should be any different from real life, and I think thats why u/all-the-right-hype was annoyed with it.",7llz2i
dwb5zqk,"Well frankly, yes! I'm a huge fan of fantasy/sci fi but if at the end of lord of the rings the orcs started flying and frodo rips off his mask revealing he was gandalf the whole time, it would be stupid and ruin the series.


Things have to make sense in the context of their own universe, and this is a universe that has realism in the setting. It's still a romance in the backdrop of a 60s cold war drama involving a political asset. Everything is 'realistic' in the context of that world as long as you accept the premise of the movie.

dv3yp2x,"By and large I agree with what you said but just for the sake of discussion:

The idea that the creature feels like an outsider (and thus relates to Elisa, and thus forms a romantic attachment) feels a tad imposed. It isn't clear that the creature has a concept of outsider vs. someone who is accepted, or even if it did, that it would matter to it. That would be expected if it was human, certainly, but it's not clear it would matter to our fish man. 

The creature does express some emotion during the film: fear, curiosity, anger, friendship, and love. Maybe it feels loneliness, which is another aspect of being an outsider, perhaps what you were referring to.

It isn't clear to me that Elisa has a sense of loneliness. In fact she seems quite satisfied in her routine and her life before she meets the creature. She has a strong friendship with someone right next door, good friends at work. She is single but doesn't necessarily seem unsatisfied about that.

e0r6ohz,"FIRSTLY!-- thank you so much for caring enough to ask, in a genuinely curious and respectful way! I'm curious to hear your thoughts in response!!

I would suggest you watch the scene again if you are so inclined.  The movie hinted in an *earlier* scene that his fingers were already beginning to rot, when he was in the car and sniffed his fingers that were turning black. Not bleeding (color=red), but black (rotting), and he winces at the smell of his hand. Smell=infected/rotting. 

Yes, it was the wife who instigated (consent ✓), but the whole point of consent is that consent is maintained throughout the interaction.  So, in bed, his rotting (ROTTING. GROSS) hand is near her face, and she says ""your hand! It's --"" before he muffles her with his dead rotting hand.

(In all honesty -- I'm wondering now if she says ""your hand""or""your fingers"" but my point remains the same.)

Quickly breaking that sentence down: ""your hand! It's--"" is clearly a PROTEST, meaning consent is broken.  Without anything layered over it, if he keeps having sex at this point while she's trying to talk to him about his hand, this is already problematic at best.  But the writer doesn't stop there.  

Continuing breakdown: Once he hears her protesting, what does he decide to do?  He takes the rotten hand she's already freaked out about and USES IT to figuratively kill two birds with one stone: 1) freak her out even more (power move) by putting rotting flesh ON HER MOUTH, and, in the process, 2) muffles her objection so he doesn't have to hear it.

And then the scene ends, implying the rest doesn't get any better.  We don't see the wife embrace him after he muffles her, or anything to suggest she was okay with any of this.

Gross and creepy. 

Unnecessary to the plot.

I 100% realize that in this movie and this world “the creature” is isnt just an animal and is fully aware of what’s happening, because if not then it would be fucking weird. Although I do not believe it is shown here. You mention consent but I don’t get where you think “the creature” gave consent for anything? Sure at the end when he kisses her underwater for me that was the only time in this movie that the creature felt human to me, every other scene you could have replaced him with a chimp and nothing he did would have been unusual for a chimp. Chimps can use sign language, he walked like a chimp at Times he even had that whole hand to head thing which is a very normal way of chimps expressing themselves (using there hands in general to communicate feelings) like I said I know in this story the creature is fully aware but that doesn’t completely negate the fact that one could see the intelligence of this creature as the same as a chimp cause really there is literally no scene that shows this creature to be anymore intelligent. Me and a group of friends went to see this (we all loved it) and every last one of us felt she kinda just fucked an animal, in the way that someone could actually interpret the events that happened in this film.

I actually disagree here. He's not just the villain, he's a major character. We get several scenes following his story. We see his family, we see him get taken for a ride at the dealership. For a cliched movie villain, this guy has some development and death. But we also see some background to paint him more positively. He gets chewed out by the general, stressing him out and forcing him to take extreme actions to provide for his family (and his also his ego). Meanwhile he acts like a deranged madman in the second and third acts because his fingers are rotting off and he's going to the Gregory House school of popping pills.

Ehhh, the thing about Strickland is that even as a heterosexual white patriarchal figure, he's a victim of the system. He doesn't develop or change - but none of the characters (except maybe Giles) do.  He is revealed, however - he reads self-help books, is easy prey for salesmen marketing a car of the 'future,' has no real confidence or inner self-worth at all, tossed like garbage by his superiors. 

Strickland doesn't really surprise us, but no one in the movie does. ",7llz2i
dv721og,"Because it has a fairy tale structure. It's an insane premise with a classic story structure... The most classic story structure, actually. As ancient as you can get. I think this was done very on purpose. 

I think the point of ""they're not telling you a story, they are putting you in a place"" is not wrong. I just don't think that's a bad thing. If you look at it as an intentional artistic choice and not just derived from incompence or a condescending subestimation of the audience's intelligence, it suddenly doesn't look like a negative point.

You see, the moment you recognize the story as a fairy tale, you look at it from a different point of view. It's not about the plot or the richness of the Characters, but about metaphors, symbols, and whimsical illustration of complex issues in simple ways that speak to you in subtle ways. The movie is so charged with symbolism that they tried to have the core plot as simple as it gets. That way it doesn't get in the way of telling the ""real"" story, which is that which you interpret from the movie's symbolic paralels. 

Take a moment to think about things like *""why did we have a completely unrelated subplot about this gay character getting rejected by a bartender and getting his career pretty much ended?""*, or *""whats up with the villain's fingers thoughout the whole movie? Why do they rot away?""*, or *""why does she fall in love with an outlandish creature so impossibly fast? Why did they setup this alien love story, and then pay zero attention to HOW a human could ever fall in love with a sea monster? Why is it so quickly understood as an obvious connection when the only thing they have in common is that they can't speak?""*, or *""why did they set up the gills on her neck thing so blatantly if they weren't gonna explore that more thoroughly, only making him give them to her at the very end in a scene which has the same nebulous atmosphere of a narrated imagined dream, exactly like the opening scene?""*, or *""why a water creature? What's up with all the water? What does the phrase the shape of water even want to say to me?""*

It's like the classic stories of our childhood. If you start thinking about Pinocchio as a story it also makes zero sense, is set up all wrong, has jumps all over the place and makes absolutely no effort to build its characters properly. How did this guy even get stuck inside of a whale? We were never told, he just kind of sails off and next thing you know he has to be rescued from inside a goddamn monstrous whale. Huh??? 

Well the point is that the story itself is simple, predictable and easily understood even by children, but it's charged to the brim with symbolism and metaphors for complex shit that would take way too long two explain formally to adults, let alone to children. You think about it rationally and it don't make no sense, and yet, subconsciously, you kind of get it in a strange, non-easily defined way. Your mind asked itself the questions and answered them before you could even shape them in verbal form.

I think finding an answer for these questions may give you way more richness and depth in the story than the simple plot may lead you to believe at first glance. ",7llz2i

People aren't supposed to look at character motivations so closely and rationally- you aren't supposed to ask ""why would she want to live under water, there's nothing to do under there!"" It is more about the overarching theme of not feeling whole, feeling defective in society and also the feeling of falling in love and being accepted despite your shortcomings and that everyone deserves love, not that the creature chose to accept her despite being mute, but that she felt normal for once. It was peppered with many scenes of old cinema and jazz- my two interests that I am passionate about and a true love letter to those out there that enjoy these kinds of heart-warming old films.

Except this never is shown to be the case outside of Strickland. Giles likes her, and so does Zelda. Elisa seems perfectly content every morning. She has a routine, goes to work with her friend, comes home and hangs with Giles, and they both enjoy each other's company. 

>Zelda has no family other than her husband, who doesn't even talk to her; and you know, she's a black woman in the 60's.

Again, never really shown. Was there a line of dialogue explaining her lack of family? Either way, it's never shown and she appears completely happy. Her musings on her husband are comedic moments, not sad ones. She gets along w/the others at the facility. I never once felt bad for her.

>Giles is a closeted homosexual, and as he said, maybe he was too soon for his sexual preference to be accepted and born too late, because his job is becoming obsolete.

Also, I never felt bad for him really except how his old boss/bf? was treating him. The guy at the diner was just over the top racist homophobe. 

>Then there's Dimitri, the 'spy', a russian living among Americans in the midst of the Cold War. 

Never felt bad for him. Never appeared lonely. He **is** on his own, but so what?

Sorry, but I completely disagree with your analysis! I think the masturbation scenes were well executed and necessary. They weren't filmed in an overly  sexualised way, they were part of her routine, part of the monotony of her life. Masturbation for her was almost mechanical, the scratching of an itch. It showed her loneliness, but also cemented her as a real human being, with sexual needs that weren't being fulfilled (much like her neighbour). 

Often in films, people with disabilities are shown to be almost less than human. Having her do something so normal and natural (yet also, absurdly, taboo) encouraged the viewer to look at her as a whole person, not an incomplete person or a person with something missing due to her disability. Which is exactly how the fishman viewed her, how she wanted to be viewed, and what made her fall in love with him in the first place. 

I don't see how it ""objectified"" her in the slightest, quite the opposite in fact, it showed her as being in control of her own sexuality, even if it was in a lonely, mechanical sense. ",7llz2i

The only real surprise was Giles (they played up the Scientist so much it was hard to call that a surprise), and all that really did was give a bit of context as to why they had a friendship (they're the same character in the same setting, with minor tweaks). Some rather standard Del Toro bodysuit work wasn't exactly enough to really elevate the story and nothing was really shot in a way that seemed to push any boundries.

As far as casting: I just don't think either Hawkins or Shannon had much to do in this movie and when they did, they hit the notes they were supposed to. It just seems to me like the hardest part for Hawkins was to learn a few bits of sign language.

All of them...like oh okay right all the military is bad  guys who like to cackle in their offices menacingly...unless they’re a communist spy of course then they have a heart of gold.  

I felt the main character was generic Amelie.  No denying the actress is good, but that’s a separate thing.  The asset at first was very intelligent, and yet later decapitated and ate a cat, because “it’s just a wild animal.”  Also the cats owner didn’t even care...come on.  Oh and later it’s a god with healing powers for no reason that lights up like it belongs on Pandora. 

The nudity and violence were gratuitous.  The movie just did it to distract from the horrible characterization and plot.   

Why do I care about neighbor guy failing at his career?  Like so many random things shown for no reason.  

Everything was spoon fed.  I don’t need her to give me a speech about how the monster sees her and accepts her.  That’s obviously the message you are supposed to get.

I don’t need him saying “you are a god!” All these things spelled out that you’re supposed to respect your audience will infer. I feel insulted that director thinks I’m so stupid. 

If you’re going to make it whimsical then it has to be consistent.  Example:  camera in the laundry room that has to be tilted.

This is just the beginning for me.  Ultimately the main premise was weird gross and dumb and I feel like a lot of critics don’t want to look like they aren’t artsy and deep, so they pretend they “get it” when they do not.   I think some of the cinematography was lovely and I’m still very concerned that this alone can make people believe the content of a movie is good simply because they enjoyed some scenes visually.

dtduozz,"> Shallow story at best, not enough SCI-FI, too much SJW side plot - what point did the gay guy , the black couple, and the restraturant/pie shop hold, propel the story forward. Not to mention a lack of caring about any of that above side story?

I agree that it was flawed in a lot of ways, but you picked an absolutely terrible example. Giles (""the gay guy"") was a central character in a story about people who aren't just on the margins of society, but who don't seem to fit in anywhere but with each other. Eliza relies almost completely on Giles and Zelda (and then the Amphibian Man) for understanding; Zelda is marginalized by her race but also isn't understood or appreciated at home; the Amphibian obviously shouldn't be caged, but also now has no home in South America; and even Dimitri is a Russian spy who doesn't exactly mesh with his Russian compatriots. 

The point of the pie shop subplot is to establish that Giles is still desperate to reach out beyond his social constraints at the beginning of the movie to the point where he somewhat ignores Eliza's wants and needs to flirt with Dixie Doug. In doing so, he puts this sweet-faced handsome young white kid on a pedestal, and then gets smacked down extremely hard when 'Doug' turns out to be just as committed as anyone else to preserving a status quo that doesn't include people like Giles or the black couple. That propels Giles to reach back out to Eliza as his ""person,"" so he can offer support and ultimately help/bond with the Amphibian Man.",7llz2i

The thing is, what you're doing here is just accepting the internal logic of the film. Sure they don't want a security camera display accessible to anyone, sure they look down on the cleaners, but that doesn't mean it makes sense. If they've got cameras in a loading bay, they would have cameras in the room. If they have a top secret asset they wouldn't let poor, easily corruptible cleaners go in there.

and that's realy poor explenation. when you have some top secret beast captive in a military base then you wouldn't just let some cleaners have acces to said room without having absolute secrecy policies to ensure that no fuckery is going on. them throwing any all secrecy measurements out of the window just because they look down on cleaners is imo a poor explenation.

Its a stupid stereotype, that was ""given"" to us by a Portguese woman who become famous by appropriating another culture in the most stupid of ways.

HOWEVER, i have to say two things, I read that she has or had a big significance to the LGBTQ community here in the US, if that its true, then disregard my silly pet peeve because thats what really is, and, her music was something that made me roll my eyes and go ""humpf"", but did not change my view of the whole movie.

If he's given her a similar macho speech she might get turned on by that association. He's the classic alpha provider.

The rotting fingers I saw as a reminder that the Creature had permanently disfigured him and that made things deeply personal and antagonistic. He's in constant pain which leads to him getting the Creature out for a second round of torture that really achieves nothing as well as recommending the dissection route even though a professional is clearly saying there's benefit to ongoing study of the live specimen.

Del Toro: Yes, of course. And it's intimate. If the movie works as a piece of storytelling, as a piece of artistic creation, it should tell something different to everyone. It should be a matter of personal discuL.pssion. Now objectively, the way I structured it, there are three clues in the movie that tell you where I stand. I stand in that it's real.

Well, he's already figured out that other's of Giles' species are sentient, given the connection he's made with Eliza.  I could see a similar situation happening between cultures. For example, we often have lobsters in tanks in restaurants that are for eating. Imagine if a person went to a restaurant of a different culture and saw lobsters in tanks, and asked if they were for eating, and then everyone there was horrified and said the lobsters are their pets.  The fishman later sees Giles and Eliza be affectionate to the cats and understands that they are pets.

We could talk about whether it's ok to kill and eat animals, but that's a whole separate discussion. Humans kill and eat animals all the time, so I don't think that killing and eating an animal alone makes the fishman a ""wild animal."" Just that he has wildly different cultural standards.",7llz2i

Also, as soon as the monster realizes cats are pets, it treats them as such. As far as the monster doing something for elisa you have a point but I'd argue romance was his way of doing that. Elisa is desperately alone the whole first half of the film. Masterbaiting every morning. Being treated poorly because she's mute. Showing her love was really his only way to help her. He's a Fishman in a strange life threatening environment. What did you want him to do? Buy her roses? Plus, romance isn't the point of the story imho. It's acceptence of things that are different. The movie does this perfectly showing time and time again that it's not easy. Elisa has to help the monster. Zelda has to help Elisa. And to contrast you see how bad exclusion is. The diner with grays and blacks. Strickland with the monster. So romance isn't really the point. The whole love scene to reintegrate was the monster trying to repay Elisa for her help and to show her that he cared for her.",7llz2i

ihyih5a,"I think, as I replied before, this was totally intentional, because the romantic interest only would be there for someone like Elisa. Assuming you don't have any challenging trait, we are people who can blend easily and live quite a ""normal"" life. Elisa couldn't, and perhaps she saw this reflected on the situation lived by the fish-man. I think this love only had to make sense to her, just like when we fall in love and other people doesn't get what we like about the person we cherish. Love is more about reflection in an emotional level than we tend to believe. That's why we would never understand what she saw in him and I respect that it wasn't forced onto us.

 Most of these characters feel static to me. As in they aren't meant to change a lot. This might sounds odd but there are plenty of characters like this. The Simpsons are never meant to change for example. Sherlock Holmes never does. Once the initial idea is interesting enough then I think it's fine without needing all this development.

 You point to the acentist as selling out our hero's but he doesn't. He says cleaning lady. That could be anyone, look at every seen when they enter the work place. Michael Shannon was just lucky he knew who it was from that. The scientist couldn't know who he was suspecting. If anything it was in character, his final moments was spent insulting the guy he hated.

 You appear to be looking for an entire different focus of the film than there is. It's about isolation, all the characters are isloted through out the film. And the film is very focused on that point throughout. All the characters and the plot resolve around isolation and being minority.

 Then you point to them not being in danger? What? They could of been caught throughout the plan. And after. There's your tension. What's this about no danger? And don't give this thing of we knew they would win it anything, we know every hero is going to win. They win in 99% of all fiction. 

 And you miss use Deux Ex Machina. That's not an example the power was all set up. It only counts if there wasn't one beforehand.

2. ""if you look carefully you'll see how incompetent he is""

Yes, which is exactly what the film is trying to make you see-to subvert traditional power roles and make us see behind the power play. You're not special for managing to see that the antagonist is just a man with a very fragile masculinity, because that's exactly what they're trying to say. 

3. The antagonist does lose his power, all through his actions. How is this not considered a change? 

4. Although it's in the romance genre, I wouldn't say one of the focuses is romantic love. It does however, question our ideas about humanity eg what makes something more of a human than others?

That contradicts itself. The conversation that you are missing out on was that this creature was a god in his world who existed for x amount of years. He expressed he was lonely even when he was free. Again, the creature could be non existent and just a metaphor for an ideal love.  You are getting to hung up on the sex and not respecting the love and similar situations. The speech Sally Hawkins give to her older neighbor friend, we have to assume that is true. The creature killed the old man's cat and attacked him, he didn't know what was happening but adjusted quick and made up for it. ""Chimps"" don't adjust like that and neither do dogs. It was higher life form learning language as it went a long. 

The creature caressed Sally Hawkins neck and hair and she freaked out because it realized the creature did love her and want to fuck her. She was going to go to her room and masturbate and go to sleep, but she decided to go back in and let the human like creature do what he wanted with her and make love. You are viewing sex as too important in regards to the grander narrative but I think I can argue that the creature consented, which is the only thing that matters. The nature of consent and ethics. Again, you are ignoring the conversation between the old man and the creature where the creature admits or acknowledgees that it was alone its entire existence because of being misunderstood. I am not religious, I know del toro is, and this film could even be viewed in that sense. The love of god and how no one is loving him despite the flawed and botched. I am not a fan of religious themes because I don't believe in those things, but I acknowledge and respect that pattern especially since Michael Shannon echoed the ""flawed"" interpretation of love and ""scripture"" which transcends religion.

dtdttoa,"> t is more about the overarching theme of not feeling whole, feeling defective in society and also the feeling of falling in love and being accepted despite your shortcomings and that everyone deserves love, not that the creature chose to accept her despite being mute, but that she felt normal for once.



That/those themes are not explored in this movie, they are pointed out, as is the gay, black family, black woman, black counter patrons, russian spies, 50's white male power and success, --- they are just hung out to be acknowledged by the director/story teller with out any exploration. It reads like a high school essay on 'bad things that happened back then' - as in ""Good Jimmy, those things did happen, and you read the book, and know I know you know I know you read the book, here's a gold star""


Not too interesting at the end of the day -- for god's sake -- they had a creature from some lagoon in a pool in the building and the best they could do is beastiality to get a rise out of the audience.

I agree that masturbation is completely normal and that it *is* nice to show people with disabilities portrayed as normal human beings with normal needs.

The truth is that the masturbation part didn't bother me as much as the gratuitous full body shot. If they had shown or clearly implied her masturbating I wouldn't have been bothered by the scene at all and would have agreed with your perspective.

It was more how the full body shot was shown. It almost felt like a Harvey Weinstein producer type had insisted in post-production that the film needed more nudity to sell, so make sure you get every angle of her before she gets in the bathtub.",7llz2i
drxldj2,"> A lot of it was facial acting but you always have a second character interpreting it for the audience plus subtitles to read

This is one of the things that really disappointed me about the movie. Once I saw the trailer for it I was interested in seeing it. A movie where the main character is mute? I was hoping to see some scenes that might not even contain any dialogue where they rely on incredible acting and directing to convey the emotion and developments of the story instead of relying on exposition. Instead I didn't feel like the movie took that opportunity/challenge much at all. Instead they just leaned on subtitles and other characters to compensate for the talking that Elisa couldn't do verbally. I thought Hawkins did a fine job with the role, but the role itself had a ton of potential to be so much more if there was a different approach taken to the movie I think.",7llz2i

What that time period did for me was to clarify or brighten the fact that things are not so different now. In fact I kept thinking, oh god, it's still like this: boys still being raised to mutilate themselves to fit into the General/Strickland model; many (most?) white people still feeling (albeit more secretly) sure that God looks more like them; our government still looking at, for example, a national park that's also sacred tribal land and saying ""let's sell it off, cut it open, take out anything we can exploit, and leave it for dead.""

 You point to the violence and nudity as gratious but it isn't. It's the most tame stuff I've ever seen. There's nothing there to be shocked about.

 You complain how the military are bad but they aren't presented as such. One general is and that's it. Shannon's character is presented as a victim as well and so was the other guy he was always with.

 The eating a cat was showing how it is different from us still and that we can't fully understand it truly. It lashed out like any person does.

 His career failing shows how much of an outsider he is and gains sympathy for him. It's a basic story telling device.

 You claim you shouldn't be spoon-fed stuff so the audience can infer it. What? You expect the audience to inferhow Shannon feels about eating his candy. Or understand that he knew and later relises that the Asset is like a god and the theme it has in it as well.

 And the movie doesn't speak out everything. It doesn't spell out the meaning of Shannon's fingers, the use of colour, the symbolism with Elisa and her relation with the Asset, the theme of isolation or why the characters ignore the main characters.

 The cameras are implied to not record anything. They just give Shannon a look at everything in the base. It is possible he just never saw. And even if he had a camera looking at it that's even stupider. Now anyone who walks into his office can see this top secret room? And you also use this whilst acknowledging how the movie is unrealistic and whimsical?

 You complain the main premise is gross. Congratulations that's the point. The same way people are grossed out by minority's in real life. You say this movie is depressing? This ain't depressing. If anything this is pretty optimistic film.

dui24wl,"Only two things I want to bring up from those points, sorry for being nit-picky because some of it's pretty insignificant to your overall argument.


1) 'unless they’re a communist spy of course then they have a heart of gold' - Not really sure if there is any point being made there, there was one doctor who also happened to be a communist  spy (his political ideology is made fairly irrelevant to his character) who was interested in the creature scientifically etc. and in someway compassionate towards it. The other communists were basically a couple of cunts/dutymen anyway, so I'm not sure what the communist angle on this really is.

2) As someone's already said, the 'gross' aspect to it is arguably the entire point of the film, if you had to assign one, and it's not a particularly subtle one at that. I don't really think we need a long discussion about it here, but I'm not sure it's much of a valid criticism to call it 'gross'; I'm sure the film is intending to encourage the audience to re-think 'gross', but I don't think it's necessarily much of a failure if some people don't come to the broad conclusions the film leads you towards.

dsloet5,"Well, just for the record, I *don't* think ol' Charlie Tuna had a diminished mental capacity, just based on how quickly he learned an entirely new language without having any help with translation.

But if he did, I'd have to stick with the rationale behind Romeo and Juliet laws. If Elisa had been 18, it would have been fine for her to get involved, even if one is technically underage. When there's that small of an age gap, turning 18 doesn't make a huge difference. But if she's in her 30s, making moves on a mental 15 year old is pretty messed up. There's no way they're similar in mental maturity at that point.

I know the age of consent is 16 in some places, but on principal alone that honestly skeeves me out, even though I know people don't magically become fully mature the moment they turn 18. There's just such a huge potential for abuse, coercion, etc. there that I guess I'd have to take it on a case-by-case basis.

But come to think of it, we didn't see *how* the sex took place. Since it started with him mimicking her actions, did she ""trick"" him into touching her in a way he wouldn't have on his own? Or did he start to take some more initiative and actively pursue sex with her? That could make a huge difference, regardless of age.

The movie definitely uses it way more as a generative subject to point to the themes/ideas it wants to explore, as *most movies* do with their plots and characters, especially in sci-fi and fantasy. Star Wars is not just about the Force. Lord of the Rings is not about hobbits, dwarves, elves, and people obsessed with jewelry. Movies with murder are also not necessarily supportive of murder???

drqg9pg,"I appreciated the scene with him visiting his family and subsequently showing how he treats his family, and what surrounds him. The movie is really concerned with who is considered the ""norm"" and who isn't, and you get more of a sense that his character isn't just a critique of predatory behavior, but also of the illusion of perfect American suburbia (white picket fences, the pastel colors). It really did flesh out his character for me. Or perhaps, how his character fits in with the themes. It also serves to juxtapose how different the characters approach sex/love (especially if you compare that scene to how Elisa has sex with the fish man). Also it just makes him a lot more egregious.

dv7ahvh,"He's willing to wash his hands before touching his dick because it's a symbol of his masculinity. He wants to be clean before he touches it. 

But he doesn't wash his hands afterwards because other people don't merit the same respect as his own penis. It doesn't matter if he touches them with unwashed hands. He doesn't feel the need to wash his hands after handling the symbol of his own masculinity. He probably associates the smell with manhood and power. 

But his poor hygiene partly leads to his fingers rotting. He is undone by his own toxic brand of masculinity. His masculinity is unhealthy as opposed to that of some of the more positive male characters in the film. That's my take anyway.

One of the the film's themes is about positive male characters regaining their agency, their ability to act after being largely passive throughout (both the Asset and Giles use aggression against Strickland in the final act and it's seen as a good thing.)

But Strickland's aggression in the last act leads to his final undoing. He is consumed by his need to live up to his warped view of manhood. His growing ineffectiveness, last act of petty violence and his death are a culmination of this. 

His unwashed hands, their smell and the rotting of his fingers is the manifestation of him getting poisoned by his sick view on what makes a man. ",7llz2i
dv664b5,"I believe the hand washing scene was for three reasons.

 Firstly to show how he is towards minority's. 

Secondly to show his own obessession with his image. He doesn't wash his hands twice for some reason as to not appear weak.

 Thridly I believe it sets up his poor hygenie standards which lead to his fingers rotting. It is something that helped factor into it.

 In a way thematically this could be seen as him putting his image before his own health and admittance if his differences but I think that might be reaching a bit.

drxeol9,"That's a good point. I guess it comes down to your interpretation of the movie, but I was okay with it because:


1. They made a direct parallel between the Eliza's inability to speak and the asset's inability to speak. Therefore, I think it would be diminishing the main character's status as a human if the asset weren't also understood to be at a human-level intelligence.

2. The asset understands spoken language better than any animal I've ever seen. He hears Giles talking about his lack of hair and his toupee, and then intentionally grows his hair back. I don't think a gorilla could figure out to do that. Even if he's unable to understand the language, he's able to connect that this dude puts on fake hair because he wishes he still had hair, and grants his wish. That shows forethought, consideration, and an ability to empathize that is at the human level.

3. This is up to interpretation, but one way to read the movie is that the mute Eliza is actually the same species as the asset. The lacerations in her neck looked like gills the whole time, and she was an orphan discovered in a river. Humans found her and sowed up her gills, but then the asset heals she her and she can breathe under water again. Even if that's not literally true, the parallels between the two characters imply, to me, that the director wants us to see them as equals/similar. 

4. The only moment where he really acts like ""an animal"" is when he kills the cat, but that doesn't seem like proof that he's not at a human level of intelligence to me. If you were from a hunter/gatherer tribe and taken to India, you might kill a cow without realizing that cows are considered sacred there. The fact that the asset feels guilt, and expresses guilt for what he's done, shows that he's able to grasp the idea of different cultural norms, or at least that not everyone sees cats as food like he does. He might have even gotten hungry and thought they left the cat for him as an offering, since he was used to being treated like a god in the Amazon.

Just my two cents. I know some people are arguing that the Eliza was just projecting her feelings onto the asset, but I doubt that del Toro wanted us to read it that way. Bestiality is horrible, but I really think that the asset is supposed to be a kind of magical, god-like creature with human level intellect, like an alien.",7llz2i

And each person has to make their own judgement call. ""Am I okay with this? Where do **I**, personally, draw the line between consensual sex and bestiality?"". And like you pointed out, ""what is the real-world difference between The Asset and a gorilla?"".

For me, it was as simple as [knowing it when I saw it](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it). The Asset demonstrates human-level intelligence/sentience in a way that no other species does. Therefore, what Elisa did was fine.",7llz2i

The track that plays in the background is called ""Overflow of Love"". Remember the end of the movie in the poem also is a call back to water being like her love and the title of the movie, taking no permanent shape, it is everywhere. I thought it was beautiful and that scene was just there to depict the feeling of being in love with someone. I know it seemed irresponsible of her but that's not the point. It's the imagery and what it evokes. I did think oh man Giles is gonna open the door and see them having sex, but then he does and it shows her embracing the creature, with no shame on Elisa's end just her being at peace in his embrace, what makes her feel complete.

We didn't want to be racist, xenophobes or nothing, but we couldn't hide our repulsion. How can you eat a cat? that was all what we all could think about. Soon enough a lot of similar reports flooded instagram, people freaking out because their Haitian neighbours kidnapped their cats. Some were able to rescue them, others weren't so lucky. And then we got to know in Haiti the food is practically nonexistant, so any animal for them is practically a delicacy, cats joyfully included. Obviously the fish man didn't starve where he came from, but the thing is those shocking behaviours come from ""otherness"", and being put there was totally intentional. The film didn't want us to relate to the creature. The film wanted to show us how different from us he could be, and still he deserved respect.

dt8krtf,"""Pan's Labyrinth"" is about as close as one can get to a perfect film in my book, so even though he's had more ""eh"" movies than homeruns like it, the fact that he was able to realize it so wonderfully gets him a lot of respect from me.  I suppose because I know he has it in him.

Beyond that, I guess when I say I admire him as a storyteller it's more about what he's aiming for and what he's able to achieve so wonderfully more-so than the areas where he falls short.  'Shape of Water' was a great idea in concept, and I would say it had everything completely going for it *aside from* the weaker script.  Were SoW to exist as, say, a short children's fairy tale book (where it could get away with less developed characters) I'd love it because it's such a unique sort of story and del Toro does a great job crafting a very ""magic"" feeling to it. 

And really that ""magic"" is one aspect of his that I hold in very high regard - he can craft these fantastical, magical realms so wonderfully in a way I've seen very few other directors be able to do.  He strikes me as the type of person with such a vivid imagination that he sees magic in the simplest things, the type of kid who takes a wooden spoon and it immediately turns into Excalibur or something, and I think with the right script - one that's a lot tighter than some of his films have tended to be - he could turn out some real classics.",7llz2i

dumccks,"The antagonist does not need to be intimidating, but he needs to develop throughout the film in some way or another, that's basic character writing.

I can't reply to that since I've never seen Sherlock Holmes or The Simpsons from start to end. 

I think that point is pretty weak considering Michael was suspecting the our cleaners from the start of the film and there's no arguing that, I mean why did the first cleaner he went to was one of the protagonists? According to what you're saying he could've went to any cleaner. 

The film does put an emphasis on minorities, although honestly when it comes to focus it's pretty subjective on what we want to see in a film. There are rules though IMO, stories should be based on archetypes, they should be on the universal human experience. Being a part of a minority is not universal, I'm not part of a minority, so I can't enjoy the film just because it revolves around minorities. Even if the focus is the isolation concept, the film clearly does not focus on it, since there is romance, action, elements of horror and thriller, although its jack of all trades, master of none.

They could've been caught, but that's like saying a certain hero was in danger because at any moment he could've had a heart attack.

The power was set up, but it was a really weak and short setup and there's never an explanation to why the creature has healing powers, it feels like the writer wanted it to have those powers and that's it.

Of course humans can be violent as well, but the point the movie is trying to make is that the creature is tender, humane in the idealistic sense, able to fall in love with a sweet women.

I didn’t miss out on anything and understand everything you’re saying but a lot of it is bullshit. A few points, a chimp and even a dog can feel guilty for doing something and not do it again. A dog gets into the trash and gets scolded it’s very possible It won’t do it again, I know from experience. The same with a chimp, I don’t think you know as much as you think you do. Also Sally touched him and he mimicked it which got her excited. How in the fuck do you think that is an indication of him wanting to fuck her. I saw this film minutes before I posted my first comment and holy shit you have to be in a fog to think in anyway that was telling of how he felt (sorry this is a big one and it’s hard for me to trust anything you feel because damn that’s just a weird observation) He’s not a god and your whole idea of its religious themes is equally absurd. I know del toro and your comment about him is just straight up obnoxious.

dte6434,"I would like to start out with that it's fine if you don't like the movie as many don't on here, it's not that I'm trying to change your opinion I just think its interesting to talk about why the shape of water worked for me against the points you've made of why it didn't for you. And I can't stop thinking about how much I liked the film so I can endlessly talk about it, so feel free to not to since you weren't amazed by it. For the movie The Fault in our Stars, I had a different opinion of the consensus. It wasn't moving at all to me even though my mother had recently passed away because of the same type of cancer at the time and I thought something was wrong with me for not tearing up from any of it... While the friends that I went in with who didn't lose someone to cancer were visibly crying and loved it. So i was letdown by that expectation that it's supposed to make me cry but it doesn't. 

I do think that those themes in the Shape of Water were explored even if that wasn't shown more with the supporting characters due to screen time, but it definitely is there for the racist remarks Strickland says to Zelda about not having a big family being ""uncommon for her people"" and that scene in the end where her husband (who is probably stronger than Strickland) doesn't fight back and defend his wife or call the police on him for intruding the home, they were powerless in that situation because of the time they were in. If that's not direct and blatant for you then that's your opinion, racism isn't always just in your face or cruel mistreatment, it's the subtle things too that make you feel degraded all the same and being less privileged. The director wasn't trying to recognize this whole issue as much as the movie The Help did. As for the homophobia, they could have done that differently and shown it more but for me I think they did it perfectly, we see that Giles' advance is unwanted when he reaches over to touch pie guy's hand, the pie guy gets angry at this and kicks out the black patrons that try to come to be seated at the restaurant. And the pie guy remarks to Giles that he shouldn't come back anymore, ""this is a family place"" even though you see he has many pies in the fridge and he's been coming back so many times, this one slip up/misunderstanding although it was unwanted gets him forever banned from the establishment. That would not happen today. He was showing homophobia even though it was Giles just touching his hand, it isn't enough to get someone banned forever even if an unwanted advance. In the background you see the waitresses staring on and gossiping about what they witnessed.. So this is why it is implied that he doesn't get the jello gig, whether the employer was informed that he is gay or if it's because creative advertising through drawing is dead. If this isn't clearly spelled enough for you then that's fine, that part isn't, but the main focus wasn't these supporting characters anyways. It was just to emphasize that theme of feeling loneliness within your place in the world. To feel lowly. Giles even says that he was born in the wrong time, either too early or too late.

But when I made that statement about the *underlying* (might be a better word?) theme - I meant it with a focus on the lead character, Elisa, since she is the star of this movie along with the creature. She is literally mute, disabled in society and can only work as a cleaning lady. The difference between Elisa and her friends is that her muteness literally strips her of a voice in a way that goes beyond the physical. Even though Elisa can communicate with sign language, her friends often ignore what she's communicating. Despite their obvious love for Elisa, her friends can’t resist their own internal ableist tendencies, particularly where relationships are concerned. Giles makes Elisa go with him to the local pie shop so he can pine over the waiter, refusing to listen to Elisa’s desire to not eat there. Zelda bemoans the state of her marriage to Elisa, though she likely never believes Elisa will marry at all. In each case Elisa’s agency is stunted, subsumed, but never diminished. It is hard to portray her emotions on screen without being able to speak freely verbally and without another character translating it, I mean in those moments by herself she's not going to just sign to herself what she is thinking- she's alone in her thoughts. But we don't really know this that much until the monologue when she demands Giles for help. That's what makes her monologue with Giles so powerful and moving. We get a glimpse into how she truly feels about her circumstance. 

Sorry, don't know how to format this on here but I liked this paragraph of a review on this movie that's from this link:https://filmcrithulk.blog/2018/01/03/the-six-shapes-of-the-shape-of-water/
""Sally Hawkins gives the most perfect and emotive “speech” imaginable. One where she lets us into her soul, let’s us into the things we have not seen. And let us understand why this “creature” means so damn much to her. And it’s right then that I realized why Jenkins is our humble narrator, and that’s because it’s how we’ve been viewing this story in a way. But it’s all too dangerous and impossible. He says no and breaks her heart, then goes off to deal with his own needs, his own wants, his own life. But when that comes crashing down, he returns to her. She is all that is in his life. And he says that he does not understand, but if it’s important to her, then it’s important to him. And it is the most clear understanding of not only where the audience is, but how we see them, and what empathy really means beyond that. And of course, the moment Jenkins meets this creature he comes to understand and see him as she does. And it is in these safe, trusted hands that we see the love blossom between Sally and this “creature.” It is here we are let into her deepest frailties and stregnth. It is here we are grasped by the touching, expansive musical number that only exists within her heart of hearts.""

 I'm not going to go into this social aspect too much though but there was sexism involved whether it was blatant or not, since that seems to be a touchy subject for some people on here that don't like bleeding heart liberals, but this movie does not want to brush over the sins of the 50s and toxic white masculinity. I'm not going to go into this though, but this movie was made to be a proper melodrama as said in an interview by the director, so he  and screenwriter made exactly what they were trying to make. Maybe the main villain was too much of an evil caricature of toxic white masculinity but people like that did exist back then. It would be a huge mistake not to include these things. And Michael Shannon played the villain ""the real monster"" brilliantly, he made me hate him. He is supposed to be this Gaston type, looks successful on the outside and someone you'd obviously choose over a monster but in fact he is the true monster like in Beauty and the Beast.
This is what makes Strickland’s story of how man is created in “God’s own image” so poignant. In his mind, ""God's image"" means white and male, but on a broader level he also unspokenly means able-bodied. 

No... I don't believe the beastiality was just put there to get a rise out of the audience. Since the creature is more of a mythical being to me than an animal. I would have been deeply disturbed otherwise, but since this is fantasy I'd give more leeway to the rules in that universe. I think it was put there so there would be no question about it, the director is not making a sweet wholesome love story that will be missing a very important part of relationships, sex. If it was removed then we would get movie goers complaining ""wow she sacrificed being with someone, a human, who can fulfill her sexually"". When I was watching it with my fiancé, the part where Elisa gets into the tub with him, he even remarked to me what we were both thinking ""what.. how's he going to be able to do anything with those sharp claws, he doesn't have a penis, etc."" But then it gets explained, the talk with the friend is necessary, even if she doesn't act more grossed out or judgemental about it, it sort of fits with her character and in how female friendships are with the girl talk and being supportive. Although she doesn't outwardly condemn it she's still being a friend. At first I was not that okay with the nudity, I don't like it thrown in my face but those scenes were put in for symbolic reasons, and then it seemed more charming and reminded me of the movie Amelie.

You make a good point about him escaping and exploring the city. They could have shown that but as the audience I cared about the lead characters and I was also worried he'd get found. I was relieved when he didn't get too far from the apartment. I think the film would waste too much time trying to find him and it's not that important to see how he feels about the world, this isn't ""Kate and Leopold"" and as the audience you would be worried that he can't survive for too long being out of water, even if it is raining. The audience would probably take issue with how the creature was able to stay alive wandering around. For me I was okay with it because I didn't want him being found out at that point in the movie. Also, I got strong vibes of the movie The Purple Rose of Cairo where the girl finds her lover staring up at the screen at the movie theatre. Maybe it would have been cool if they put the creature from the black lagoon on screen instead.",7llz2i

Given that he was dying, I imagine he couldn't resist sticking a knife where he knew it would hurt Strickland -- right in his ego, that he had been outsmarted by the very two people he saw as nothing more than mere objects to be used.

However, it actually is partially a victim of plot hivemind, as it doesn't account for what insanoid would do AFTER the ending.

The whole idea of falling in love with the asset is whimsical, that's the fairy tale, and it's good. Using that to explain away glaring problems just bogs the whole movie down.

But even if I brought that he was  equal to Elisa in terms of emotional and intellectual development, he had just recently gotten tortured, was in unfamiliar environment and was almost totally dependent on her to interpret this strange world.

 I'm saying the scientist said cleaner. That's it. How is he meant to know anything that Micheal is thinking at all? Your point doesn't make sense, he could've went to anyone from his perspective but we the audience knew what he would do.

 What story should be universal? Using that congratulations almost every Oscar movie ever isn't, lots of them are based on minority's. Movies shouldn't be limited about what everyone can experience, then they all be the same stuff.

 And the idea that it can't be about isolation because it's also a romance is ridiculous. Im sorry to say it might be the silliest thing I've ever heard.

When the issues are pulled out as simple props that hit checkboxes for being present, with no exploration or added depth to the story do I cry foul. That's cheap, and I was looking for Oscar material, at least story-wise. 

Seems like the word beastiality is a hot-button ticket to downvotes. The physical act however, didn't bother me in and of itself but the lack of build up to it did bother me, a critical moment that ended up playing out as a shock tactic rather than some grand union of ideas, philosophy or love, or something...

The Russians, the diner, the car, the handwashing, the wife all were attempts at something that didn't connect, were heavy handed, and dead ends really. If the idea was comic book level, then fine I suppose, but my understanding was it meant to be high level fantasy with themes and ideas leading back to the relationship between our two main characters. The side plots provided little if any support to the main theme.

And what was the main theme, really. I'm asking because I just don't see one. Who really grew, changed, learned something, became or got knocked down ?  Maybe at a base level I'm misunderstanding fantasy. 

edit: i get it, it was clear from the beginning, she was from the water, had gills, met her man, died, or did she, and went back to the water. OK, maybe that is the fantasy. If so, it was weak.

To want to sing your heart out but feel trapped in not being able to communicate exactly how you feel. I related to the feeling of being a misfit because everyone around you can talk freely, and growing up feeling there's something defective with you when people keep asking in the first few minutes ""why are you so quiet"". How people who don't speak up are sometimes treated lesser than and assumed to not be that intelligent as extroverts or not really have much to them besides what you get to see in public view. Also this was filmed in my hometown and university, maybe part of the reason I love it so much. 

I loved Lala Land too and could relate to both characters, especially Ryan Gosling's love of jazz and that most people treat it as ambience music to be drowned out at fancy restaurants or cafes. No movie has made me as sad as the documentary Dear Zachary though...after the movie ended I had to go to another room just to sob, and I couldn't sleep even though the events occurred a while ago.

She actually does mention that when she wants to go rescue him. So it wasn't a movie about telling the world that this creature has feelings and need to be brought back to where it belongs, it's about someone finding an unlikely partner and finding more in common of a person from a different species than your own and falling in love with them, so it totally does make sense in this case.",7llz2i

Third, you can't assume that the reason anyone doesn't like a movie is that they ""don't get it"". I understand the movie. It is about love being love. About it knowing no boundaries. About extreme loneliness and detachment. About communication. About people perceived as different being stepped on and pushed aside, instead of understood and integrated. About strength in unity. About the abuse of power. About the radicalization of patriotism and authority. 

Am I missing anything? I understood the movie, I just didn't like the way the themes were forced. For example, I'm not racist or homophobic, but that doesn't mean I'm going to like the diner scene just because it aligns with my positions when it comes across as an educational school video lesson.

I didn't think Gillman's personality was developed enough to explain why she was in love with him (enough to break the species barrier) rather than just felt a kinship with him.

In the Planet of the Apes remake movies, the apes also prominently sign, and given how the third movie ends so will all humans going forward. However, the apes in the movie show a lot more personality than the Gillman.  So if Planet of the Apes 4 gave us an inter-species romance (either chimp/human, gorilla/chimp, orang/gorilla, or any such combination etc) I could at least see where its coming from, as they have a personality.  And sci-fi shows often have inter-species romances between humans and aliens, but they work because at least the couples are shown to have some personality traits in common.  

I just didn't buy any chemistry between SoW's leads that justified their relationship being romantic.   The movie needed less sex and more time developing Gillman's personality to show us why she loved him despite the species barrier.",7llz2i

Movies that are great on re-watch and have layers and you notice new things everytime you watch them and are so intricate, etc. are great, obviously. But if you are bored on the first watch, why would you want to re-watch it to pay attention to minor details?

And I'm not saying that it has to have lots of plot twists, that's not quite what I mean by predictable, though I partially mean that, but for example, the bad guy, the moment he shows up he's creepy, he's an over-the-top comic villain, there's never any doubt that he's gonna be the bad guy. The characters are exactly who you think they are as soon as you meet them, they aren't dynamic. So when you meet him, you know he's the comically bad guy, you meet the russian scientist and find out he's a spy and meet his handlers, you know immediately that the handlers are going to turn on him, every piece of information you receive, you know exactly what it means as soon as you get it, for example when they are told by the workers that you can smoke in a certain spot because of the dead spot in camera coverage, you know that's not a random detail and that it's going to be part of the escape plan. It's one thing to have setup and payoff, it's another when the setup is obvious, it made me feel like I was being spoonfed a movie. Everything was exactly what you thought it would be, the characters, information, the plot, it was all incredibly predictable.

dwqaian,"I agree that re-watch is important, and there's plenty of films that are good but don't inspire any rewatching in me, and we all tend to focus more on those rewatchable films, which I think has more to do with complexity and depth (Complex characters with nuanced motives/intentions, high attention to detail by the writer/director/props/etc, clever thematic elements and so on).

I think you're misinterpreting what I mean by ""twists,"" and seeing it totally as big plot twists like in The Sixth Sense, or Seven, Fight Club, those giant Shymalan-style twists. I'm not talking about that, I'm talking about much smaller twists, and maybe ""twist"" isn't the right word to use. 

You could call it surprises, or complexity of character, as in characters aren't simple and straightforward, you don't meet a character and immediately say ""That's the bad guy!"" and know that he's THE BAD GUY permanently with not even a glimmer of hope for some kind of change. Complex characters have multiple dueling motivations and fluid allegiances and you're not exactly sure how they're going to act. So you could say a character seems like an ally, but then TWIST is actually an enemy, though I think that's rather reductive. But there's plenty of examples of great characters where you don't know if they're ally or foe, and it's not necessarily a spy-double-agent like Shymalan twist, but rather a whole story where they're maybe on the fence and you are trying to figure out which side of the fence they're going to end up on. With complex characters like that, they don't need to ever actually have the twist or switch sides, but you can have that possibility there. In Shape of Water, there's never any doubt about any character, they are all exactly who you think they are and you know they aren't going to change, there's no doubt there, no glimmer of possibility, making them all very predictable. Which isn't necessarily a horrible thing, it's not like every movie needs to have complex characters with flexible morals or allegiances. But in Shape of Water, everything felt that way. 

Another example, in many good films, there will be scenes which begin one way, set up an expectation of how the scene will play out, but then that expectation is subverted, surprising you. This can be very small, and not even notable on a synopsis of the movie, just a small surprise. For example: it's a cliche now, but that moment where a new character is introduced and they say ""you've got a lot of nerve showing your face around here"" (Lando in ESB) and you think some fight is about to happen, and they stare each other down, and then they embrace as best friends. That's been so overdone now that it's pretty much bad writing to do it, but it's a decent example of how a scene can set up expectations and then confound them. Or another Harrison Ford reference, in Raiders, Indian Jones is confronted by a swordsman who swings his sword around a bunch in a challenge and you expect a sword fight, or for Indiana to use his whip, etc., but Indy just casually pulls his gun and shoots him and moves on. That's not a big plot twist, but it's a very small moment that's a pleasant surprise. And that can be done with small things like moments within scenes.


Shape of Water had none of those things, from characters, to the overall story, to the small details like the scars being gills, to the theme, it was all made so clear and in a way that had no ambiguity or uncertainty that half-way through the film I felt I could turn it off and write out how the second half of the film would go and I would have been pretty much dead-on in really specific detail. I think a key part of a first viewing is to be pleasantly surprised, and don't think that means a giant plot twist, I think those are generally overblown, overrated. In Shape of Water, I knew ahead of time that they'd end up at the docks, that the bad guy would ""kill"" the main character but the fish monster would use his magical healing powers to save her life, that her scars would be revealed to be gills, and I knew that there was going to be something weird with the bad guys fingers. I was surprised some that he yanked them off himself, which is maybe my favorite bit of the movie. By being so predicatble in all ways, not just in terms of giant plot twists, but in the small things, by having static characters, and by telegraphing the theme and even the small details like the gills, I basically was never surprised by the second act of the movie, I felt like the second half was just wasting my time in slowly telling me a story I already knew. It's like when someone tells you a long joke with a long setup but you know the punchline before they get halfway through the setup, it's just boring. 

>Sure, Inception had plot twists...but god knows it means nothing on a rewatch and contemplating the plot isn't that interesting. On first watch it was the best movie ever...rewatch it a couple of times and you quickly see it wasn't as great as you thought and you forget about it. 

I don't agree that it seemed like the best movie ever on first watch... I thought it was okay but disappointing, mostly because it didn't surprise me. That's kind of a special case, because Nolan is obsessed with overly convoluted plots and twists and revelations that the timeline is being messed around with (see also Westworld). I never thought it was great though because it was just full of superficial twists that really don't call for deeper analysis. If anything, it was surprising how much they totally wasted their premise. It's surprising when you have a bunch of exposition to setup the rules of how this works, and then later in the movie you have to do it all over again with more exposition because you've changed the rules. That's certainly a surprise, but not a good one.

Hell, the Colonel wouldn't have gotten his throat cut if he hadn't just gotten done gunning down Shark Boy and Lala Girl.",7llz2i
dtjhqv9,"Wow, I'm sorry you took it all that way, reading so much into it.

When watching the Coca-Cola commercial right before the movie that night, I had an aside or outside thought in my head: every scene had mixed race boys and girls, that to me, looked just like every town and movie theater I've been in, but that outside thought i referred to led me to consider it through a modern conservative's eyes, and just how mad they'd be seeing all these races mixed together in every shot. I was a bit stoned, so my mind was wandering, but I could totally see them bitching about that commercial, saying all this multiculturalism is being forced down their throats.

My coworker (who used to love movies) does that now, and now he hates almost every movie, if he even takes the time to see it at all. It's all ""liberal trash"" to him.

dtlvv8i,"I myself often wonder what movies and tv series conservatives watch, since they all seem to practically hate Hollywood (or Hollyweird, as they would call it). Having mostly liberal views myself (honest!), I don't mind seeing non-white/straight/ male/beautiful characters, as long as they're well-written, and well-acted. But when the character feels placed there just to represent, for the sake of diversity, that's when it bothers me. 

I'm going to use Star Wars as an example again. When The Force Awakens trailer came out, a lot of people freaked out over Finn. And others about Rey. Making 2 of the protagonists a black man and a woman? Regardless of whether you thought this was the studio being P.C., or didn't even think about it, it wouldn't have mattered, if by the time the credits rolled you were satisfied with their roles and performances. I really liked Rey (In TFA). They portrayed her as a strong, independent girl with potential for greatness. They never told you she was strong and independent, she just showed it naturally. For example, when Finn grabs her hand and she's like ""what the hell are you doing, let go of me!"". That was a subtle way of showing independence, I loved it. I chuckled at the scene but didn't go ""yes, you go girl, tell it like it is!"". The scene just occurred naturally, the significance of it underlying, not at the surface. Not literal, or blunt.

Finn, on the other hand...The definition of a token character.

I don't really care if a Coca-Cola or whatever product commercial shows white, female, black, asian, and muslim people frolicking together. Whatever. But let's not pretend like it's not a conscientious choice from the producers and just occurs naturally. My issue is when you do that stuff in a movie or tv show, and it's not justified by the story or character development. When it seems placed there by the writers to show they're ""woke"" and to awake others. Regarding The Last Jedi, which is a perfect example, look up Rian Johnson and that ""ask me about my feminist agenda"" tweet. (If you're into comics, check out the YouTube channel Diversity & Comics. Fascinating stuff). 

Not everything has an agenda behind it, but some things definitely do. And I'm not even going to mention the stuff that goes on at music/tv/film awards shows these days. Your coworker seems quite extreme regarding his views, but to some extent, I understand where he's coming from. To some extent. 

P. S. Sorry for going from Coca-Cola to a galaxy far, far away. My mind wanders...",7llz2i
dt2mrtz,"Nah, I pretty much covered everything I wanted to say. ",7llz2i
dt1wcnk,You seem very bothered by something that supposedly bored you. Or are you unable to watch movies that don't have white straight guys in all of the lead roles?,7llz2i
dt2crs6,"Yes, I am using it correctly, as you do clearly hold personal resentment for the film's setup based primarily on traits of its antagonist. How exactly do the allocation of these physical features amidst the character roster govern your interest in the plot of it all? That would suggest fairly shallow viewership on your part. How about the countless number of emasculated/queer-archetype villains that have made their way into such a mass of filmography across all decades, let alone villains who aren't white?

Your displeasure with watching a hugely privileged individual thrive with evil in a time period basically made for (and by) him, both in the fiction and in real history, suggests some serious insecurity or denial.",7llz2i
dtmspjc,"Well put, and I understand where you're coming from. I totally agree if the characters are written well, then I have no problem, but you can tell when one is there as the token. Sometimes it works, other times it falls flat.

If you take a step back and watch a lot of shows, even ones from only a decade ago, they are still predominantly white. I guess I champion role diversity as much as possible -without going token -since that's what the vast majority of America looks like, at least population-wise. Square mile-wise, or taking land area into account, not so much, since middle and rural America is white as ever, except for the cities. I think a lot of the backlash is from those in rural areas, who see ""their America"" slipping away and turning into a very mixed race, diverse place, which is shocking to them. 

Good points about the SW movies as well. Having 2 daughters, I'm glad there have been many more strong female characters for them to relate and look up to. Cheers!",7llz2i

dt6jjsu,"I'm saying that your approach to this film and its creative choices shows a lack of regard for rationality. Your critiques are unsubstantiated being as you seem armed to seek out an ""obvious subtext"" that's not actually there. At no point in this film is there an effort to deride people of a specific race or sex. del Toro's main points of critique are entirely sociocultural, highlighting the flaws of dogmatic masculinity and bigotry that were pervasive for the era and still hold quite true for many parts of America today.

Give me any concrete sign of this being cultural Marxism, and I won't see it as a lazy dig at a movie that doesn't put the straight white guy in the role you wanted.

In terms of queer villains,

-Silva

-Buffalo Bill

-Xerxes

-A shitload of Disney villains

-Voldemort

But I don't need to continue with a fetch quest, examples are prevalent for you to find.
