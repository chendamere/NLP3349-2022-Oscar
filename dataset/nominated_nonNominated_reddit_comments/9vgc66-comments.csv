e9bxxdb,"Heads up there's some new features on YouPoll!

Now anyone can use the Chart or Filter link in the upper corners of the applicable poll or list. With filter you can add all kind of deviations and other nerdy stats to see how the overall ranking lists play out.

With charts on individual polls you can now see all kind of different graphs for the breakdown of scores. Even cooler there's now an animation feature which lets you see how the poll changes over time. I think one of the most interesting one to try is The Last Jedi which you can try here: [https://youpoll.me/3751/r](https://youpoll.me/3751/r)",9vgc66

e9cf64i,"Dr. Seuss is a man of considerable skill

A man with a passion to rhyme to his fill.

_

He wrote many books, of green eggs and ham

of cats in their hats, and of children named Sam.

_

A favorite to many is one perennial classic

read yearly by folks, who seek Christmas magic.

_

The Grinch is his name, he's mean and not boring

He hatches a plan, to steal Christmas' morning.

_

But he learned a good lesson, and thrice grew his small heart

He turned a new leaf, and started a new start.

_

A decade or so later, a cartoon was then done

From Chuck Jones and company, and oh it was fun.

_

Jump forward in time, about a decade or three

A big movie was made; an annual must-see.

_

That Grinch wasn't perfect, it sagged in the middle

But the end was so great; played my heart like a fiddle.

_

Fast forward again, to this present year

""Another Grinch?!"" you may say, but have you no fear.

_

Yes the previews look stupid, the ads all look trite

But surprisingly so, the end-result was no blight.

_

The beginning is great, devilishly funny

The middle less so, but still worth your money.

_

Then comes the finale, the stealing of Christmas

It differs from the book, but please just bear with this.

_

It has a light charm, that you can not deny

with slick animation and wit; I can't lie.

_

It changes the ending, but only a little

the spirit's the same, and again ""heart=fiddle.""

_

So what can I say about the new Grinchy flick?

Should you pass, should you rent, should you see it right quick?

_

I think parents with children will like it a lot,

if only to see the smiles on their tots.

_

And though it's not perfect, overall it's a win

If I had to rate it, I'd give it 8 out of 10.",9vgc66
e9g3k1p,"I love Cumberbatch but he isn't exactly the guy I'd peg to voice The Grinch...felt a little dull through most of the runtime. But, the rest of the voicework is great, and Kenan Thompson, you need to do animation more! 

Fine, but surprisingly long for 84 minutes. Sure most kids and families will like it enough, least those in my theater did. At least it isn't The Nutcracker and the Four Realms. ",9vgc66

e9grq6z,"I thought it was a fresh take on The Grinch story. The overall storyline was pretty original outside of the third act. 

If you're a Grinch fan I would recommend it, mostly because it isn't what you expect it to be but it still delivers. It's not a remake or a copy. ",9vgc66
e9qvfdp," I am a very big fan of the Grinch both the original and the Jim Carrey version and if your expecting those qualities in the slightest you will be very disappointed. First off the Grinch is not even that mean, he loves his dog max and is overly affectionate constantly telling him, ""You can do it max believe in yourself!"" It is 2018 so animal cruelty is out. Secondly they didn't even stick to the script of the classic Grinch we all grew up with. No in this Grinch Cindy Lou is the older child of three with a overworked single mother who's only wish that her mother had it way easier. Because in this Grinch movie Betty Lou is a strong independent woman and she don't need no man. Finally the music of the movie was completely awful, not having one original song. Even after getting through the whole god awful movie, you think to yourself maybe just maybe I can hear one original ""Your a mean one"" at the credits so I can leave going well at least it wasn't a complete waste of money. No, its a weird rap song. So the only thing to do is run out of the movie theater with hopes that you can make it back home to watch a Grinch movie to make up for it. I could go on and on about how I despised this movie, but what I'm trying to get at is if your a Grinch fan don't, DON'T see this movie. The only thing you'll be doing is telling yourself ""this couldn't get any worse"", then be shocked as it gradually hits rock bottom. ",9vgc66
e9ldcy8,"Personally, I liked the movie. My only complaint was that there wasn’t really any resolution for Cindy Lou’s wish. I half expected the Grinch to join her family... but the movie will definitely go into the yearly rotation. ",9vgc66
e9i0f00,"Surprised by how much I enjoyed this actually, I only saw it because I'm a Cumberbatch fan and I thought I'd enjoy 90 minutes of him obviously having fun in a sound booth. I don't have many strong feeling for the Carrey film, I was 9 when it came out and liked it but I don't have any super fond nostalgic feelings for it but I can say I liked this one a whole lot more. The Carrey one just feels insufferably preachy to me now, having Cindy Lou Who be like the moral compass for everyone. This one wasn't about society changing it, it was about one person (who you can tell is a good person) who let trauma and anxiety distort his view realize and accept that he was wrong. Also I like how this one didn't go super hard on the whole anti-commercialism message, since the Whos didn't have to learn that message. It just is a sentiment that comes off as hollow and hypocritical when Christmas movies shove it in your face. 

I can see why people in this thread didn't like it, most of the humor is slapstick and there are moments where you are like ""I know what's going to happen, what is the point of watching this?"" but I really appreciate what they did with the character and I'd happily watch it again. ",9vgc66
eabrp23,"I thought it was pretty cute. Not a big fan of the modernized Grinch song or the weird rap song at the end, but everything else was pretty good. The aggressive God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen was the best song in the movie imo

e9c4iv9,"This is definitely the most Harmless, and inoffensive Dr Seuss Movie yet.

Excluding the Chuck Jones classics.

It's also miles better than Illumination's own Lorax movie.

But...

Part of the problem is that 'The Grinch' isn't that funny. Specifically, it isn't clever. But the fact that it isn't annoying, unlike Secret Life of Pets or Minions, it gets a tiny pass.

What saves this movie is Cindy Lou Who and her motivation. It's a genuinely good idea they came up with and it rationalizes The Grinch's decision to change.

One thing is for sure, this movie proves how Spiteful and Offensive Ron Howard's Grinch movie was. Excluding Jim Carrey, that movie is horrible in every way.",9vgc66
e9c6a2i,"I’ll say it. I enjoyed this better than the live action one..... 

Jim Carrey was great and all, but that movie has so much unnecessary stuff added to it. This movie has padding to, but it was all connected to The Grinch’s scheme. Him wanting to steal Christmas didn’t just come in at the last minute. 

I also enjoyed the Cindy Lou subplot. Again, it was better than the live action one and actually adapted what Seuss wrote. This time, the who’s actually knew what Christmas was about instead of competing against each other and getting pissy when Christmas was stolen.

The Grinch being more human and relatable might annoy some people, but I had fun with it. The theme song doesn’t match him at all, but other than that nitpick, it was nice to see a version of the character that keeps the concept, but makes it different instead of copy-pasting the past three adaptations. (His relationship with Max was pretty cute to. There’s no reason for him to be treated like crap) The scene with his heart growing looked beautiful, and the fleshed out ending was nice. (Also, thank you writers for not setting him up with Cindy’s mother)

All in all, good movie. I wonder what Warner Bros is gonna do with The Cat In The Hat. 



",9vgc66
e9dfi94,Actually a pretty good movie. The animation was absolutely phenomenal. The narration struck a great balance of classic Dr. Seuss while still being slightly more modern for a more modern generation. The soundtrack was great and I wasn’t expecting Tyler the Creator to do a couple of song; that alone made the movie for me. It was a full length film but it felt pretty short. It’s closer to the Jim Carrey grinch runtime but felt much more like the runtime for the original grinch cartoon. IMO that’s a good thing. The humor while obviously aimed at a younger crowd wasn’t completely unenjoyable. I defintly think it’s a great remake of the classic grinch cartoon. ,9vgc66
e9cwggx,"It's not terrible, exactly what you'd expect from Illumination. ""Despicable Grinch"" basically. 

All this movie did though, was make me appreciate how good Ron Howard's 'The Grinch Who Stole Christmas"" is, and what a great performance Jim Carrey turned out.

He confessed that he does his hair/beard, he had a huge sleigh, and the cookies weren't eaten the night Grinch was taking the gifts. I thought they were going to reveal that Santa (Bricklebaum) couldn't deliver gifts because he didn't have his sleigh and that's why the cookies weren't eaten.

Then nothing happened, and I'm confused with why the cookies were never eaten, or if there even is a Santa in this rendition and what parents wake up before their kids to destroy the cookies before they wake up.

It’s way closer to Karloff and fits the Grinch more than the American accent he used. It’s off putting. Honestly I feel like Gru is closer to the Geinch than the actual Grinch in this movie.

Way better than the Ron Howard version though. That movie does not hold up at all. ",9vgc66
ecfh42d,"Just saw it and overall it was... fine. I think the story had originality and I like the fact the grinch was more of a normal person, it made the his decisions more relatable in general, but it did take away from the main theme of the original.

It's very much a paint-by-numbers, Illumination brand, extruded movie product. There are a couple of laughs, almost by accident, but the whole enterprise shows so little thought or effort, it's actually rather infuriating. 

The characters are bland and the voice acting is uninspired, except for Keenan Thompson, who is a gem. 

The narration, which strives for a kind of hip-hop, Seussian style, is universally terrible and many times they can't even be bothered to get the meter right.  Pharrell sounds like he's reading a first draft of the script while sitting in the waiting room of his dentist's office.

The story is fairly pointless and the whole thing feels overlong at 1:45. Despite filling the narrative with gunk to pad the run time, they still manage to elide some of the best bits from the actual book and the classic cartoon.",9vgc66

Did someone confused this with the upcoming Pets sequel? Oh, great. Can't wait till they bring up the Christmas-themed logo in said Pets sequel.

THOUGHTS ON THE TRAILERS BEFORE:

* Ralph Breaks the Internet - Actually pretty good, Can't wait to wa--Hold on, IS RALPH DOING ***THE*** FLOSS HERE
* Spies in Disguise -  Thought it looks cool, kind of reminds me of The Emperor's New Groove except Oscar the Fish is the spoiled emperor llama, and Spider-Man is the humble villager dad.
* How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World - Damn, I couldn't wait to see this.
* The Secret Life of Pets 2 - Actually looks good and hilarious (don't even get me started with those evil twin cats! ""We start fires!"") Also, Max is now played by Patton Oswalt now? Can't wait where Max says ""Anyone can cook!"" to Duke.

Where the 2000 one added so much and went incredibly over the top, including making the Whos real asshats, this one dials it back so much very few thing register; although it's odd to see the Whos to straight up nice to the Grinch. Grinch himself is less evil and more of just a whiny jerk. A few aspects do work like the neighbor thanks to Kenan Thompson. Cumberbatch was bland. Pharrell's voiceover was awkward.

Adding a neighbor, single mother angle, friends to Cindy Lou Who, a reindeer who shows that the Grinch isn't completely void of redemption earlier than his turn about face, showing how the Grinch planned everything to a tee so he could rob the whole neighborhood in a night fleshed it out, I guess, but made the film meandering. It was barely watchable for me and I didn't fall asleep. The whole Cindy Lou Who hinting at her Christmas wish she desperately needs to tell Santa, when clearly it's about her mom who she empathizes for was a very annoying plot point that came up several times just so they could reveal it to the Grinch. Cindy Lou Who's friends are boring and their plan to attack Santa was also boring me.",9vgc66

I won't judge the humor because it's a kid movie.

My only complaint is that in the original the Grinch hated Christmas and the whole town because he was bullied as a kid. I felt like it had a more emotional impact on the character and gave him a real reason to hate life. They changed it and it is way less impactful now.

This 2018 version is just way too different and the ad campaign once again proves that the story will be bastardized into something that will sell more corporate products.

I would have liked to see the Grinch create or take over an orphanage. Since they made that his backstory and he seemed affected by Cindy Lou being selfless I thought having him find joy in bringing kids like himself the Christmases he never had would have brought that around nicely.
