dq3owfn,"Man. The whole movie is great, but that scene where Lady Bird finally confronts Danny about being gay and instead he just breaks down crying and she comforts him was the moment I fell in love with it. Such a 180 of where I thought that scene would go. ",7doxvl

dpzs3qq,"I love that we are now getting at a point where we can have early 2000s period pieces. This movie perfectly encapsulated that time in so many scenes throughout the movie, doing it hilariously so every time.

My favorite example of it was the use of ""Crash Into Me"". It reminded me a lot of the use of ""Drops of Jupiter"" in the movie Other People. Taking a song that we've heard before and using it in a stereotypical way at first and then using it later on in the film to help get to the emotional core. It's a welcome trend for me and has changed my opinion on both of those songs.

It was also just a surprising hilarious film altogether. I was expecting it to be funny, but not nearly as funny as it actually was. The awkward scenes at the Catholic school, the way that Kyle first mentions his father's cancer, and the scene where Lady Bird's dad was just playing solitare while Lady Bird and her mom fought all had me bent over laughing.

Just a beautifully orchestrated, loving, tender film about growing up and realizing that your parents are people too.",7doxvl
dpzrb7g,"Loved everything about it. I would have watched 8 more hours of it. The scene with Lucas Hedges crying into Ronan was the best  highlight for me (in a movie full of highlights). Almost started crying myself. The Ronan/Metcalf relationship was unbelievably real & familiar.

The most laughs I've had at a theater this year (mixed in with teary-eyed moments). Just a great script, direction, performances.

Greta Gerwig can do no wrong at this point. Ronan's accent was super impressive and she jumped to number one on my Best Actress prediction so far. Chalamet's character was great, his delivery gave me a Nicolas Cage vibe for some reason (no idea why, doesn't make sense, but made me laugh a bit).

Also, what a year for Tracy Letts. The Post, Lady Bird, The Lovers. Didn't like that last one at all, but that's an impressive year.

Easily top 5 of the year, 9/10.",7doxvl

dpze38b,"This is a beautiful movie, easily the best I've seen this year and one of my favourite coming-of-age movies period.

Every part is perfectly cast and expertly played. Ronan and Metcalf will get the Oscar attention, but the whole ensemble deserves recognition. 

The scene where Lady Bird is in Sister Sarah Joan's office and they discuss how there's no difference between love and paying attention is a perfect way to encapsulate the entire movie.

An actual 10/10. See this movie. ",7doxvl

As a guy, I don't know what relationships are like between mother and daughter, so it was refreshing to see a film that seemed pretty authentic in it's depiction of a mother and daughter.  Loved the performances and hope it picks up a few Oscar nods so more people will see this wonderful film.",7doxvl

dqenftz,"This film is one of two things:

1. For the people who relate to it: painful, cuttingly real, upsetting, difficult, emotionally triggering to the point that someone might relive the emotional abuse of their adolescent years...

dpzdn7v,"Man having gone to Catholic high school, everything was just so dead on perfect. I laughed so hard at the JV coach becoming the drama teacher and they way he was still like a coach to them. Or the anarchist kid who’s still going to a private high school. So many great little touches like that.

Yeah I’ll admit it, I cried at the end. Wasn’t even expecting it, just a very perfect kind of melancholy. I also grew up in kind of a boring town but they way she talked about driving it for the first time and relating it her mom was so touching. What a perfect way to end a film.

Can we just point out we are in a quiet amazing time for teen movies this decade? Easy A, The Spectacular Now, Diary of a Teenage Girl, The Edge of Seventeen and now I think the best of them yet Lady Bird. I think we are finally having directors reflecting on the more poppy teen romances and trying to make something more grounded and honest. 

Last thing this is probably my favorite film of the year (check back with me in a week to see where I feel then) and if Saoirse and Gerwig could make do like a Before Trilogy thing and just make a film Lady Bird about Lady Bird every 10 years that would just be the best. Or at least please work together again.

Okay serious last thing but who knew the guy who wrote Bug and Killer Joe could play like the most charming, cuddly dad in movie history?",7doxvl
dpztk4z,"As someone who was in the orbit of several people who went to Catholic high school in Sacramento in the late 90s and early 00s this movie is dead on.

The movie is near-perfect at encapsulating all the things that make Sacramento unique and the things that always annoyed you, but you didn't realize you love until you leave the city.

I loved the little bits of local character like New Hel and The American Market on 24th.

The only way it could have been more nostalgic for me is if they recreated the back patio of the True Love.",7doxvl
dq08sa5,"Lady Bird walking to the church in New York and making that call to her mom is probably my favorite moment of 2017. The cuts between her and her mom driving though Sacramento gave me the biggest smile. Just everything about it was perfect.

Movie really is something special. So happy Greta is getting all this love, and Saoirse was amazing. Probably my fav of 2017",7doxvl
dq7wd66,"When I was in high school, I wanted more than anything to go to Sarah Lawrence. I wasn't so much searching-for-culture as Lady Bird was, more of a ""this is the kind of place where writers come from"" sort of a thing. By the time my senior year came by, I didn't even apply, for two reasons. One was a sudden fear of being so far from literally everyone and everything I knew. The other was the realization that my parents had not only never HEARD of application fees, but that coming up with them suddenly was genuinely a hardship. I graduated in 2007, not 2003, I went to public school and not Catholic school, and I was honestly a lot more like Julie than Lady Bird, but goddamn did this movie hit on more than a few unexpected tender spots. 

On an aside, the tears started at the climax, because, God, my mom's favorite punishment was the silent treatment. Often inflicted on the whole family, who usually honestly couldn't tell you who did what. ",7doxvl
dqi3vw0,"A lot of scenes between Lady Bird and her mother are just stories right out of my own book. It brought back bad memories and made me feel absolutely awful. I almost cried when they were in the fitting room and she asked “but do you like me?” 

My mother is exactly the same: passive aggressive and never satisfied with what I do. She also didn’t want me to go to a university far from home because she was almost obsessed with the idea of me never leaving her side, and I fought for it just like Lady Bird. And like Lady Bird, I love her and know how much she loves me but can’t help admitting that she doesn’t like me as a person and we will likely never truly understand each other. 

As the only 20 year old girl in the theatre, I felt I might be the only person who really empathized and understood Lady Bird’s entire perceptive. The old ladies around me were all kind of amused.",7doxvl
dpze45i,"This was an awesome movie. Having just entered Freshman year of college, it's weird now to be older than the kids going through these coming of age stories. I hope that unique stories like these continue to be relatable as I get older. Movies like these make me really not want to be a grown up. ",7doxvl
dqqlwlm,"This film was a barrage of these small moments that were relatable, sad and funny (often all at once). The scene where Christine is just begging her mother to talk to her stands out for me as absolutely heartwrenching. Saoirse perfectly captured that desperate, fearful need of a child finally experiencing a parent's withholding of attention. That scene alone I'd give her an award for, and that goes without mentioning her superb job all through the film, with great supporting performances as well.",7doxvl

After seeing Danny break down in tears, asking Lady Bird to not tell his parents he was gay I think I understand a little more. ",7doxvl
dpzempw,"Loved it. Random thoughts:

* *Rushmore* is one of my all-time favorites, and I kept drawing comparisons as I watched *Lady Bird*. Then, about halfway through, we see a Rushmore poster in her bedroom!

* Holy crap some of this stuff was achingly relatable (particularly because I went to Catholic school). The idea a lot of kids have growing up that *life is happening elsewhere*, and more than anything else they need to *get to where life is happening*. I couldn't have better summed up my outlook when I was in high school (and beyond...)

* I'm 27 and I'm *just* getting to that point where I'm beginning to realize how much I owe my parents and how much they did for me. As Lady Bird learns (in her first week of college, no less) it takes becoming an adult to appreciate the adults in your life.

* Like *Rushmore*, this is a lot more clever than meets the eye. People may need multiple viewings, but there is a lot of really subtle set-up and payoff.

* Also like *Rushmore*, it's not necessarily laugh-out-loud funny (though, I laughed a lot); it's more funny in the content-smile-on-your-face-the-whole-time sort of way. 

I don't *love* Noah Baumbach, so I wasn't sure what to expect from Gerwig, but goddamn I loved it.",7doxvl
dpzg8h7,"I enjoyed the movie a lot, I gave it an 8 in the poll, but I definitely feel underwhelmed.

Based on the comments and the reviews I've read, I expected to be completely blown away by Lady Bird.  I expected to watch a masterpiece.

Instead, what I got is a coming of age story done very well.  It's charming, it has funny moments, dramatic moments, great characters and dialogue, exceptional acting - but it's still just a normal coming of age story.  The beats were familiar enough that it was fairly predictable.

I definitely would still recommend it, but I'm a bit disappointed. ",7doxvl
dq0sst8,"My top-line review: This was a really fantastic ""coming of age"" story, that doesn't re-write the genre, but provided some fantastic performances from Ronan, Metcalf, and Feldstein.  Beanie Feldstein really is an emerging star; her comedic timing and genuinely heartfelt interactions with Ronan were by-far the best parts of the film. The dialogue and reactions to events that happened throughout the film were so damn believable.  It truly should be seen as one of the best films of this year.

However, I also had a much stronger connection to this film beyond just the general themes of the film.  I was raised in Sacramento, and there is just SO DAMN MUCH this film gets correctly.  Whether it be the just general terminology (""The fab 40s"") or the general struggles kids growing up in Sacramento constantly deal with [(""UC Davis IS wayy too close to go to college"" - such a perfect little interaction I totally had when I was selecting which college I would attend)](#spoiler).  It just gets so much right.  I think perhaps my favorite line of dialogue was when Lady Bird was talking to Jenna about how her family house in the Fab 40s was ""their starter home"" and now they live in Granite Bay. Just too damn perfect.  Also, I will say, I am glad that Sacramento is finally starting to find a bit of it's own culture, but the line about escaping this suburban sprawl for some place with a history and culture that is unique to it's own was something I've been saying my entire childhood.  However, just like Lady Bird, I too left Sacramento for greener pastors, and decided to come back home :) There's just something special about this place.    

I know that as a stand-alone film about a girl coming of age, it's fantastic.  But I didn't think I'd see in my lifetime a film that so aptly understood Sacramento and the people here. A true love letter that understands it's strengths and flaws. 9/10.",7doxvl
dq26b4n,"Wow, I can understand why people could feel slightly underwhelmed about the movie after all the hype and flawless reviews, but it definitely made me feel in a way no other movie has this year. The last 20 minutes were especially emotional to watch, as I have been emotionally estranged from my mother since high school. Also Saoirse Ronan has the most expressive and striking eyes!",7doxvl
dqn8hvm,"Holy hell, this movie. A pretty simple movie that was incredibly well executed. I wanted it to go on for so much longer than it did. Saoirse Ronan is a major league actress and absolutely deserves any of the accolades she ends up getting from this one. 

Laurie Metcalf was amazing too. Hell, everyone who appeared in this movie was amazing. But I'm hard-pressed to think of a movie that did a better job with the portrayal of a genuine mother-daughter relationship. It captures perfectly how frustrating that relationship can be for both the mother and the daughter while also showing how much love there is, regardless.

The fact that it was a love letter to the early 2000s was an unexpected surprise too.

10/10.

On a side note, I posted about this movie on Facebook, and my dad left a comment about the great things Lady Bird Johnson did for the country. Oh Dad.",7doxvl
dpzwion,"I liked pretty much everything about this except the editing. Scene transitions felt very abrupt in some places, like I was watching a series of vignettes instead of a continuous story.

I know that sounds negative, like I didn't like the movie, but I did. A lot. It was both funny and heartwarming, and I felt like it was training me to have empathy for someone that in real life I would give pretty short shrift to. It's just that I don't have a lot of insight to contribute on the positive side.",7doxvl

dpzrbl4,"I would have enjoyed this movie so much more if I hadn’t seen it in a packed theater here in Sacramento. Honestly, it was like watching a movie with a crowd from 1895 who were utterly aghast that the things they saw right outside were magically appearing on the screen before them. Every single time there was a shot of a local landmark, people audibly gasped, laughed, and cheered. 

I mean, it’s cute and I’m glad they felt represented, but it made the movie feel cheap.

dtk5w3y,"My favorite part of this movie is when Lady Bird and the nun are talking about Lady Bird's college essay, and the nun asks if Lady Bird thinks love and attention are the same thing.

I'm pretty sure that line right there is the *entire* point of the movie. The whole fucking thing connects right there, at least for me. I like to *get* something out of my movies, and that gave me something to think about long after the credits were over. 

I know a lot of these coming of age movies have really hipster characters, and that's definitely present here, but it's not jarring like it is in a lot of those movies. These could all be real people, and they act like real people. That seems like a low bar, but in the age of stuff like The Fault In Our Stars, it's really not.",7doxvl
dv9adnf,"What I loved about this movie was how real and non-cynical it was. Most coming of age movies see the protagonist going from being an innocent child to having sex, drinking, doing tons of drugs, and becoming extremely rebellious. And sure this movie had some of this, but it also had a lot of restraint and balance that I found refreshing: Lady Bird doesn't just jump straight into bed with the first guy she meets, and even when she does get physical with her boyfriend, she tells him she isn't ready yet; she gets drunk with her friends but it's not a way to cope or act out, and her mom doesn't get mad at her for it; she goes to Catholic school and does act out against the strictness occasionally, but she still is friends with the teachers/nuns that work there and doesn't completely revoke religion when she goes to college; she fights with her mom but it's always between moments of them laughing about something and never results in her running away or taking some other drastic action; etc.

I just love that this film flies in the face of every BS standard that it's been decided a film needs to meet in order to be dramatic or entertaining, and it ends up being just as dramatic and entertaining. It's real, it's cathartic and heart-wrenching at times, but it's also optimistic and positive and I love that so much. ",7doxvl
dqr7g15,"The movie did kind of lack urgency especially with the overall conflict(getting into a desired college/relationship with her mom). Nevertheless, I still really enjoyed the film. 

I suspect that a lot of people will be turned off by the protagonist. She's selfish, self-centered, and willing to lie or ditch her friends to be with someone. However, Christine's bluntness(which her mom shares), unpredictability, and willingness to fight for what she wants gives her charm. Her flaws give her room to develop(coming of age story after all); all of which she recognize at the end when she pours out to her mother in a very poignant scene. 

Something else I want to mention is the supporting cast. They feel a bit more realistic compared to other movies or TV shows on the CW. Julie is a normal girl instead of being a fat BFF comedic relief. You don't see any bullying stereotypes. The catholic school doesn't seem that stereotyped at all aside from the ""leave room for Jesus.""  

Laurie Metcalf and Saoirse Ronan definitely deserve honors for their performances. I also looked Larue Metcalf and realized she plays Andy's mom in Toy Story. ",7doxvl
dqs272q,"It was a nice little film. I can tell a lot of thought and love was put into it.

I think it was over-hyped to me though, because I left feeling a little bit of ""that was it?"". It wasn't anything groundbreaking, I've seen that story a hundred times of awkward teenager coming into herself/over-bearing mom does it out of love, etc etc.

It was a good film, though. A solid 7/10 for me.",7doxvl

dvg4m5f,"I appreciated how they portray the Catholic School environment as a completely ordinary and typical high school. It just felt very realistic.  For whatever reason, Hollywood frequently represents Catholic Schools as over-the-top oppressive institutions, and that’s just not true. Catholic high schools are just like any other high school, except with a religion class.  Some you couldn’t pay to go back, some it was the best years of their life and they’d pay *you* to go back.",7doxvl
dpze1nr,"Glad I went out of my way to see this. Greta Gerwig can now add ""director"" to her resume as she slowly conquers indie cinema, and based on this, I am so on board for anything else she does behind the camera. I could feel a lot of Baumbach and even Wes Anderson in here, but this is so undeniably Gerwig to the point that Lady Bird feels like a role she herself might've played had this been made 10 years ago. Ronan is charming as hell, I could've watched hours of her doing her thing, and her scenes with Laurie Metcalf were simultaneously hilarious and heartbreaking. One of the best of the year, hoping this can find some luck at the Oscars.",7doxvl
drecaqc,"This was my favorite Laurie Metcalf performance of all time.  I've laughed at her work many many many times- Roseanne and Big Bang Theory. But she always felt kind of stage-y and broad  to me.  Here she was just .... tired.  

I know lots of people here are hating on her, but as someone closer to Marion's age than Lady Bird's age, I can see that they are just very similar women.  Marion is not a great mom, but, she does have a wonderful connection with her daughter (starting with crying together over the Grapes of Wrath), and is a victim of abuse, and is dealing with the dad, and works basically two jobs.  And we see she is nice in general. Just not with Lady Bird, who she sees so much of herself in.  It's hard to be kind to the reflection in the mirror sometimes.",7doxvl

But the quirkiness and coming-of-age narrative was typical, Lady Bird was almost unlikeable, Sacramento was not part of the story outside of exposition, and the most interesting characters were supporting cast/had minimal screen time. Additionally, the moment at the end with the discarded letters should have hit harder.

Too many other movies stick the characters in a small town and act like it's hell on earth, as if the West Coast is so glamorous, and in reality, it's really the same with one day rolling into another, yet there's an economic disparity and all these expensive lifestyles to compare yourself to that makes it almost worse than a midwest town where everyone is equal.

dq3x5uy,"How featured is Sacramento? This movie sounds up my ally... I grew up in Sacramento and graduated in 01. I'm curious how it holds up to my own experiences.

Much like the synopsis of the character I read, I dislike this city and have always wanted to leave. I don't know if the main character ends up escaping for her dreams or what but I'm 34 and still haven't managed it. A lot of my buddies joke that it's just an open-air prison with a blackhole at the bottom. It always sucks you back. For me, family. 

I still dream my parents will open up to the idea of moving their care to Oregon (mom has several medical issues) so I can give my kids a life in the PNW, hopefully before the kids are too old to feel like our new city is ""their"" city. My brother moved his family out when his kids were entering high school. They still feel like transplants 3 years later because everyone else knows each other from back to middle/elementary.

dutri3f,"First off, I loved this film. I'm late to the game since it took forever to come out in the UK but it was fantastic. Between this and Get Out for film of the year for me. I could have watched Lady Bird for another three hours easily. I thought this film was everything Boyhood was praised for, yet didn't deliver on in my opinion. One thing I found interesting was that although she was cruel, Laurie Metcalf's character was right about Lady Bird, she was selfish, and did only think about herself. The characters in her life were all going through their own personal battles, her ex dealing with his sexuality, Timothe Chalamet's character dealing with his father's cancer, her mother's abusive upbringing, her father's depression, her bestfriends weight issues and unrequired love for a teacher, her brothers post-college plateau and his girlfriend's family abandonment, Lady Bird rarely pays notice to those around her and her sympathy for them is often fleeting. That theme that everyone is fighting their own battles, but is forced to deal with them alone and hide them from a society resistant to difference or outbursts of emotion played so effectively. And despite Lady Bird's narcissim, what I found the most resonant was that this was really fine for a 17 year old, and her mother just couldn't understand that she was still a child who was allowed to be selfish and need affirmation, she was exhausted by her daughter's selfishness but Gerwig presents Lady Bird to the audience in a way that encapsulates the idea that you have to let a 17 year old be there hormonal, selfish, anxious self. Worked brilliantly. ",7doxvl

dqqbpmy,"I thought it was really good, no doubt it was very well done and the acting was superb. I think all of the hype around the rotten tomatoes score led me to expect more than it was. That being said I had one takeaway that I haven't experienced with any other film. In the scene where Ladybird goes over to Julia's after ditching the popular kids for Prom, Julia is crying and Ladybird asks why. I've never experienced such a morose yet concise summation of depression. Julia says ""Some people just aren't built happy"". I don't know why but that really stuck with me. Also Laurie Metcalf was absolutely phenomenal in this.",7doxvl
ds72akc,"I can’t say I agree with the reviews. The performances were strong and the relationships were touching; however, the story was bland and the characters themselves were all stereotypical of coming of age genre films: the gay theatre kid, the troubled musician, the best friend who’s dumped for the pretty girl at school.

As strong as the performances were, the film didn’t take any risks and as a whole felt like a movie that’s been done plenty of times before.

It was *fine*. I can't see anyone watching this and thinking ""wow, I really hated that movie"", but I can see it boring a lot of people too, especially in my male 18-25 demographic. 

There just wasn't enough going on for me. I get that it's a coming of age character study, and clearly that's been great for a lot of people.

I wasn't actually too fussed about seeing this for the reasons above, but it was 10:30pm and the list of decent 1h30m movies seems to be getting shorter and shorter :-) It did what I asked of it. Passed 90 mins before bed.

dwnlxi0,"In my life I have rated only a handful of movies with 10/10 rating. Lady bird is one of them, and here are the reasons.

First, I myself (28 male, Greek) was raised in a small town and had to leave it at 18, so this movie hit home so hard, I was literally sobbing for 2 hours during and after I watched it. 

1) **It was real**. I'm tired of watching all those feel-good comedy dramas, where there is a happy ending for the viewer and everything is wrapped up. This movie felt like looking through a peephole of a household in Sacramento, all of the characters were 3 dimensional, had their own background and depth. The struggling, yet loving mom, feeling sad for the family's financial status and worrying her children might feel ashamed because of it. The emotionally distant dad, that plays solitaire while a huge fight is taking place behind him, who suffers from depression, but gives all he has to his children in the best way he can. The lies Ladybird uses, to seem 'cool' to her colleagues, seems cheesy, but is quite common in that age. 

2) **It is nostalgic.** It may be even more because I was 15 in 2002, but the core values are the same. The way Gerwig has written the core relationships between mother-daughter, where in one moment they're fighting like they'll never speak again, and at the same moment they speak about casual things, like which dress to wear at the prom. Also, the way Ladybird is rebellious and trying to question everything that is given to her (basketball court scene about adoption) or religion. I have many more examples, but the feelings were nostalgic, because I remember very distinctly fighting with the same thoughts or seeing parents making selfless efforts to keep you happy, without expecting to hear 'thank you'. 

3) **Little moments.** It may sound a cliche, but the little moments in this movie take the cake for me, as they're so very true, relatable and heart-warming. 

* The scene where Ladybird is crying in the car and her mom doesn't know why, but she hugs her and comforts her.
* The scene that she tries to confront her gay ex and he is ending up crying on her shoulder, because it's hard for him to come out to his parents.
* When her mom is not speaking to her and she is crying for her attention, but still getting the silent treatment. 
* The emotionally shut dad, who never expresses his feelings, but who gets hurt from leaving Ladybird one block away from her school 
* The final scene, where she's driving for the first time in Sacramento and wants to share this moment with her mom and her mom has already had the exact same thought. This for me captures the spirit of this relationship, the - sometimes - overwhelming struggle of a mom to protect her child and deter her from having the same bad experiences that she had had. 

4) **Performances**. Oh my god, the casting was excellent and the deliveries of Saoirse Ronan(Ladybird), Laurie Metcalf(Mom), Tracy Letts(Dad) are absolutely stunning. Their delivery feels so natural, that it really made me re-watch scenes 2-3 times and admire their geniusness. I've seen Laurie Metcalf in Horace and Pete as well, delivering a mind-blowing monologue. I feel if they were in not such a great movie year (seriously 2018 was an amazing year for movies), they would have gotten both Oscars. 

5) **Aesthetics**. Last but no least, the photography and the location of the movie were stunning to watch, also the colors, the soundtrack was beautiful. Not to mention Saoirse Ronan's natural beauty, which Gerwig herself complimented (something in the lines of I'd prefer to show her face for the whole movie or something) [link to article anyone?]

So all in all, if you are someone who enjoys watching action and super-hero movies, probably you didn't get the hype behind this masterpiece. If you expected this to be a movie where 'something happens' and there is start, middle-part, end sequence, you watched the wrong movie. This is a realistic, nostalgic drama, and if you ask me movies should be made more like this, than everyone expecting something to happen or a happy-end or anything. I can't wait to see Greta Gerwig's next projects.

It also reminded me of a saying about standing ovation: When the moment comes for a standing ovation, and you have a doubt about it, whether to stand-up, if you'll be the only one standing etc. it's not the right moment for it. The right moment for a standing ovation, is you can't wait for it to finish, to jump on your feet and clap with all your strength. 

This movie made me re-think all the 10/10 ratings I gave, cause I wanted to give it 11. ",7doxvl
dqn58r3,"Absolutely wonderful. As someone who was an 18-year-old girl in 2003/2004 in a town I hated with a mom I didn't get along with, this hit close to the heart. Christine is such a well-developed character, flawed but relatable. Saorsie Ronan gave my favorite performance of the year. Lucas hedges and Laurie metcalfe are wonderful as well. 

I've been a fan of Gerwig's for years and am thrilled to see such a clean directorial transition. This feels like an artists singular, personal vision. Even my partner who dislikes coming-of-age stories liked this movie.",7doxvl
dsegkjn,"This was probably one of the ""realest"" and ""everyday"" films I've seen. Things are brought up but not explored, e.g. Danny's sexuality or Christine's dad's depression. But the film feels so, I don't know how to say, ""textured"" that it all felt natural. Nothing felt manipulated or forced.

The editing of this film is also brilliant. It felt so tight. The film felt dense. I thought I watched a longer film (which would usually be something bad).",7doxvl
dswwc3x,"I’m really late on this, but having just started college, Lady Bird was one of the most relatable films I’ve ever seen. The relationship between Christine and her mother, how they bond so well one minute and argue the next, it is parallel to the relationship with my mother. I teared up a few times throughout the film but I start sobbing pretty hard when Christine begs her mother to talk to her. That scene had my sleeves drenched in my tears because I can personally relate and I know the feeling that Christine felt. It’s truly a good coming-of-age film, and to daughters/children who have close relationships with their mothers it probably got them tearing up too.

du0glk5,"I loved this so, so much. I’ve never related to a character more. I’m also seventeen in my final year and applying to universities out of town, and I have a (slightly more positive) similar relationship with my mother, and a loving but quietly depressed father, and even one of my best friends reminds me a lot of Julie. Oh, and I definitely had a crush on someone who turned out to be an absolute “I don’t believe in the economy” Kyle. 

I saw a lot of myself in Lady Bird, and especially bad qualities - her selfishness and ignorance at times, although it’s never, I believe, mean spirited but simply from a place of longing and hope and ambition and passion. And a love/hate (mainly hate!) relationship with her town. 

I didn’t cry during the movie or even afterwards, but about an hour later I sort of realised what I just saw and started sobbing. I feel so grateful to have this film in my life. I appreciate my mum a lot more. ",7doxvl

You know all the tropes, such as:  girl ditches her long-time best friend so she can get in with the “cool kids” only to eventually find that the cool kids are actually lame. Girl loses her virginity against mother’s advice and surprise, it’s horrible, regrettable sex. Girl couldn’t wait to move to the glamorous and exciting big city, then misses home. And the whole call me lady bird thing just seemed ridiculous (I get what it’s supposed to say about her character... it just seemed... dumb, and I couldn’t imagine anyone in my high school doing such a thing). I don’t know. Laurie Metcalf was good. Maybe I’m judging it harshly because I saw the Killing of a Sacred Deer the day before, which I loved, and I just have dark weird taste in movies.",7doxvl

dsnm5zm,"The real joy of this movie is what it didn't do. There are so many ways these types movies can go wrong and this movie avoided them all. The balance they find is just remarkable and deserves to be celebrated.

That being said, it's not a movie for everybody. It's a movie of moments. So there is no real strong narrative pull demanding your attention. Within these moments you can find the humor, the humanity and the truths that speak to you. It doesn't beat you over the head with it. 

It's this incredible balancing act and trust in the audience to discern for themselves what makes the movie so lauded by critics. I think people are going to miss that and expect something more.

dvkxvoc,"Finally saw this. Late to the party. Yada yada. It was a pretty good movie. Great acting, solid script. The one thing I felt was really lacking though was the direction... nearly every shot was on a tripod. Just felt like a standard movie, nothing about the directing felt particularly good to me. I know, not all brilliant direction is tracking or moving shots. But usually Best Directors are nominated on their creative use of shots. None of the shots felt Oscar quality to me.

That said, pretty good movie. Definitely feel it's overrated, or maybe just not for me. Felt very disjointed and it was hard to get an emotional attachment when the story jumped around so much. ",7doxvl
dq45a9l,"Saw it today and it's very good. However, it hit me really hard with nostalgia and sadness because I went to a Catholic high school right around that time and Lady Bird reminded me so much of my best friend (though she was cooler). So it made me miss her, and that made me sad. 

I do kind of wish the guy who says ""I won't touch your boobs because I respect you and love you"" doesn't always turn out to be gay in movies. It's like guys are all dicks or gay. And not everyone in theater is gay! But what happened in the film was still believable and done well.

It's extremely realistic and well-made. But it hit so close to home for me that it made me uncomfortable. It's tough to make a new ""coming-of-age"" thing without treading familiar ground, but Lady Bird always feels like an authentic self and not derivative.",7doxvl

I will admit to being a structure snob before I say that the film ended three times.  I thought it was a story about [accepting and learning to love one’s mediocrity.  Then she gets accepted at her school.  So, it’s about how growing up hurts.  I guess.](#spoiler)

dsnqjap,"Just saw the movie. I really enjoyed the movie but I couldn't tell  you why if you  asked me, so I'm writing a long post trying to get my thoughts down as to why I did enjoy it. I haven't watched anything like Lady Bird before so it was an intresting experience. There were funny scenes, sad scenes, scenes I could relate to and others not so much. I thought  the father character was hilarious, seems like such a stand up guy who loved his daughter, dispite the many hardships he was going through. The mother character seemed like a hard ass at first, especially with her comments such as ""you'll never get a job good enough"", but it made a little more sense when she told Lady Bird about her own mother. I could write a lot about all the characters (Kyle was funny although shallow, I felt bad for Danny because he seemed to lost when talking to Lady Bird about his sexuality, Julie was a great friend who seemed to be facing issues of her own that were not covered in the film unless i wasn't paying close enough attention) I'm on mobile so I'll just skip right to Christine ""Lady Bird"". Having graduated high school only 5 years ago, I felt like I could relate to a few things that Lady Bird went through. She seemed to have created unreal expectations in her own mind and was disappointed when they didn't live up to her own self-generated hype (losing her virginity, New York). She was trying to set herself apart from the rest by giving herself that nickname, but maybe trying a little too hard, something I did my senior year (trying too hard) lol. The ending seemed odd at first but after some thought I really liked it. Christine obviously matured (maybe just a little but none the less) when she realised what her family has done for her and how much she did love her hometown. My favorite quote in the movie was when Lady Bird was talking with the sister in her office ""Don't you think maybe they are the same thing? Love and attention?"" I guess why I liked it is because it felt real. Except for the portrayal of some of the high school parts, it felt very realistic that these are experiences someone in the modern day would be able to relate to. Heartwarming movie, I enjoyed the dialogue, and it kept me thinking a while after the movie was over.  ",7doxvl

dupuhn3,"Just saw it. It was ok. Well acted and held my interest but it suffers from what a lot of directorial debuts do: the narrative isn't all that smooth and there are sudden cuts to another scene.

drsnrkg,"Enjoyed it, but stunned at how effusive the critical praise is. This was a 7-7.5 for me. Great acting, solid writing and direction, but nothing hugely noteworthy, and it wouldn't be in my top 20 or 30 films of the year.

It felt like the film was going to stay subversive and satirical to the end by having Lady Bird not get into the good school, but in the end it kinda deferred to the same sentimental coming of age tropes I was hoping it would avoid.

It was less hipster-bait than I was expecting, which was nice.",7doxvl
dsliznt,Halfway through the movie is when it really kicked in for me. There are so many things touched on that while watching it it took me back to when I went through something similar during that period and damn it got me really emotionally invested by the end.

dtkm0i4,"Gotta say, Frances Ha had a more emotional and melancholic impact on me. But it's unfair of me to compare those two films:

What I find interesting the most is that the success of Lady Bird has come from its authentic and accurate yet truthful and frank depiction of emotional development in one's life; something always present in previous films Greta Gerwig had starred in. The stark illustration of emotional vulnerability and insecurity is something so present in her performances yet as a director you can entirely feel her presence and mark left upon the film. It's a beautiful and yet melancholic touch Gerwig leaves upon her works.

Saoirse Ronan is **beautiful** in this film. She is emulative of the anxieties and insecurities I have seen in almost every person I've known in my life and myself. 

In fact indie and mumblecore films (Namely Frances Ha) I find have such an honest emotional depiction that I find it hard to give a decisive judgement and opinion towards, because to me it's something incredibly **relatable**. I don't see it as something dramatic, I see it as something incredibly realistic - almost as if it were shot fly-on-the-wall - and in turn personal. It's not, ""someone was in a car crash"", or ""he lost his parents"", or even ""his parents got a divorce"", it's just the small things to people that are big things to them. It's so truthfully personal that I feel like I can't rate it, because it's something so familiar. ",7doxvl

A lot of comments here state they don't like the titular character, and that's fine. I understand. Seventeen-year-olds are developmentally a bit narcissistic at their age naturally. Now add in a mother who doesn't even like you, ignores you, insults you, won't respect your privacy, and will not support your ambitions and it's grounds for a fight for a better life regardless of how selfish it looks to anyone on the outside.",7doxvl

dsaqgdr,"It’s a lovely film, but I found it a bit overrated (fucking hype!). Its biggest merit is how it handled the mother-daughter relationship: every scene with the two characters is beautifully written and that’s where Gerwig’s screenplay really reaches a level of true insight - just pure, genuine and relatable human emotion. It’s wonderful that Laurie Metcalf is getting recognised by this role. She is playing a real character with none of the gimmicks and histrionics we usually see on performances considered “award-worthy”. To me, she is the true star of this picture. Ronan is also terrific, but she is more vulnerable to the script’s inconsistencies - particularly in the school scenes, where most of the characters are broad stereotypes and build around ‘quirks’ (as a result, some of the sequences that rely on humor are kind of a miss, like they didn’t really get the tone of the joke). I appreciate the film’s rhythm and its moments of sensibility, but didn’t find it so insightful or special enough to set itself apart from the genre's best.

Wow. So much better than I was expecting, even with all the hype. I think it kind of had a lot of coming of age cliche'd points, but did them in such a realistic way that they felt fresh.

As a teenager living in a small place, I could relate to some of the feelings expressed in the film, but I guess it didn't hit 10/10 because I'm not American neither live in 2002 (just born) and things are a bit different. I recommend it.",7doxvl

While that's obviously a reflection on life, the movie just felt like it was incomplete, like it didn't really have much of a goal in the storytelling.

With that being said, Gerwig has an impressive handle on the tone she wants to convey during this film from its first scene to its last, which is rare for a directorial debut. Saoirse Ronan is absolutely brilliant and Timothee Chalamet was hilarious. Great to see a young cast clicking so well together. I definitely thought it was good but it didn't stick with me in the way that my favorites from this year (The Florida Project, The Big Sick, Blade Runner 2049) did.

I shed a single tear in the final scene, and her mother circling around at the airport had me close to tearing up. It’s a clever emotional roller coaster, in the same vein as The Big Sick 2017. 8.6/10!",7doxvl

Saoirse Ronan was fantastic as the lead and so was Laurie Metcalf as the mom (I literally kept thinking Sheldon's mom the entire time). I think Metcalf could potentially get a best supporting actress nod for this. The movie felt like clips of teenage moments at times instead of an overarching plot but it worked perfectly. I also liked the fact that it wasn't a ridiculously long movie. Highly recommend. ,7doxvl
dqe63ul,"This is in my Top 5 favorite movies now. Saoirse is one of my favorite actresses so it only makes it right. I relate so much to it; difficulties with parents and financial life, coming of age, not knowing what you want to do or who you want to be. I definitely feel for Christine's desire to experience life elsewhere in the world. The cinematography, the contrasts between characters. Everything was so delightful. 

There's so many little subtle things, like even little things like a mural she was standing next to that had what looked to be a peacock and a woman, signifying 'Lady Bird'. Christine's troubled thoughts of who she is really hit me because I think it's a way of thinking that a lot of young adults go through, wondering whether or not you can be better than you are now or if you'll stay dormant in whatever life you're living in.

10/10 in my books. Can anybody recommend movies of this type of style/humor/topic?",7doxvl

Like we never see BF#1 confront his parents about his sexually, or why/what the priest asked Lady Bird’s Mom to not tell her, or why LD’s friend was crying on prom night, etc. The only possible answer I can get is that the director chose to leave things opened ended because being a high schooler, you don’t always get to know why things happen, or care, they just happen and are never fully answered. However I feel like Greta had answers for these scenes but they were left on the cutting room floor.

It wasn't that great at all. It was okay but it really just felt like a more boring Napolean Dynamite without the payoff.

The movie opened up a lot of interesting subplots and then never followed up on a single one of them. It tried so hard to be bland that anything interesting they tried to understate. 

The scenes with Ladybird and her mom, as well as Ladybird and the nun teacher/principal: those were all good. We didn't get much of those.

I was disappointed.",7doxvl

 It was also actually funny and comedic. The jokes hit well throughout and they never felt forced. It found that right blend between emotion and drama.

Nothing ground-breaking for the genre, but extremely solid and deserving of all the praise. I was surprised at how funny it was, and how much I connected to the location despite being from the UK. I guess I saw a little of my own town there and connected it to my reevualuation and similar feelings of longing once I left for uni.

Everyone seems to be saying that this scene floored them but it felt mostly empty to me since we don't really know all that much about her and what issues/problems she has?

duekj0s,"I thought Lady Bird was very refreshing. The actors seemed like real life people, and the dialogue/situations realistic. I related to MANY things in the film. 

If I had to say anything negative, is that I don't see the big hype over Ronan. She's a solid actress for sure, but didn't connect with her as other actresses in similar roles, like Winona Ryder, Brittany Murphy, Anya Taylor-Joy, Lola Kirke, or even Greta Gerwig herself. I actually thought ""Julie"" the friend was more engaging. 

Besides that, I am thrilled that Greta is making movies like this. There are hardly any female filmmakers in her age group, so it's rare we see that POV in movies. Hope she keeps going!!!

And the biggest thing I felt was this film had a Boyhood feel to it.We see Lady bird (Christine) fumble her way through life and try to piece her life together. In the end shes probably better off then she was to start but still on the journey of life.

dw2j0tc,"It was a fun dramedy. I'm a late 20s male but still found it watchable. Bit predictable? for sure. The gay boyfriend, the asshole cool group, the best friend reunion for prom. But just because it is predictable doesn't mean it isn't realistic. I found it well done, and very nostalgic. The strongest aspect of this movie is the cast; Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf , Lucas Hedges, Tracy Letts, Beanie Feldstein were all really well casted.

Her father and the adopted brother's gf may have been my favourite characters overall. The mom, although passive aggressive, was a good mother at the end of the day. My mom was a lot like her. I always thought that was more because we came to Canada as refugees and she grew up in a different culture/time. I wouldn't say she was as 'evil' or 'abusive' as others have on here. In fact, I sort of was on her side as the movie went on. Basically just the regular battle between generations. To be truly abusive, I need some alcohol/drug abuse, some physical violence, some actual malevolence, not a mother who takes her daughter shopping, sews her prom dress, etc.  

Overall it isn't some kind of generational masterpiece, but to me, it was a nice look into someone's life, and a solid 7/10. Basically you're a fly on the wall of a teenager going through struggles and ascending into adulthood. Sort of reminded me of Edge of Seventeen and Boyhood. ",7doxvl
dwm7l7c,"I honestly don't understand how people watch this movie and not feel emotionally attacked. This movie has lots of relatable and heart-warming quotes that are really useful in our daily lives. Even if you can't relate with the character of Lady Bird, this movie will make you feel something if you really try to understand what she is going through. A solid 10/10, one of the best feel good movies, or generally one of the best movies i have ever seen. Greta Gerwig is such an insipration

Why is Ladybirds relationship with her mother so difficult? Is there a past that made it this way with them or is it just “her mother was an alcoholic” and we leave it at that? They could’ve just had some kind of short scene with the parents talking about it or something.  Also where did Ladybirds brother Miguel come from?!

And I kinda wrote it off as being another one of those quirky teen indie flicks, but instead of pissing me off by trying too hard, this film was just flat out endearing. And I can certainly relate to the middle class struggles while growing up surrounded by rich folks.

Also, Lucas Hedges is just great. That's two years in a row now where he's cried in films and almost brought me to tears which is rare. He does a lot with a little in this film after a stellar performance in Manchester by the Sea. This kid is going places for sure.",7doxvl
driovav,"I thought this movie was good, but as someone who lives in Davis (and is proud to be getting my graduate degree from UC Davis) I was sort of offended by all of the Sacramento-trashing.  In fact, it always bugs me when people complain about how terrible their hometowns are.  I mean, come on, Sacramento is the freaking capital of California and you're complaining about how boring and ""culture-less"" it is?  It made Lady Bird come off as selfish, which may have been the purpose, but it still annoyed me.",7doxvl

The funny parts didn't feel forced, the sad parts were genuine, the stories felt real. 

The one thing that confused me a little bit was [her relationship with Lucas Hedges. What were his motivations when they started dating? Did he really mean all the things he said about Lady Bird?

dtgax87,"It's definitely one of my favorite movies of the year. My only issue is with Julie's character. I felt it was way underdeveloped and not very different to an archetype I'm having trouble identifying. I know, I probably shouldn't be criticizing the writing for a certain character when I'm not one hundred percent sure *why* I don't like it but hasn't her character arc been done to death? 

I can't think of examples right now but the whole ""main character starts acting cool and distances herself from uncool friend"" is something I'm sure I've seen many times in movies and series. And there's nothing wrong with her character being based on an archetype and providing the conflict for the second act, but it's kind of a missed opportunity to not give her character more depth. During the second act, Danny struggles with his sexuality, Larry just got laid off, Marion has her usual disagreements with Lady Bird and...Julie is mad at Lady Bird because she's acting cool?

I'll have to watch it again because I'm probably wrong seeing as so many people here loved that character. I didn't hate the character by the way, just think it was underdeveloped.",7doxvl

One of the most impressive parts to me was how rootable they made the main character.

She was passive-aggressive with her mother and I think most of the teenagers are behaving like this towards their parents, which I could say, a difficult phase for a ""child"" as he/she adjusts to crucial changes happening in his/her life because of growing up. Also, this is not like any other Hollywood cliche movies where you would be waiting for the protagonist to mess up real hard say, for instance Danny's big secret would be revealed at her expense or she'd be bullied by the entire school for lying about her address, status in life, etc, etc. The context was almost the same, sure but they went into different way.

dvfnu42,"I heard about this film several months ago and I was so eager to watch it for such a long time. Shortly after it's release in Australia, I went to watch it and I was not disappointed. This film was spectacular in every single way possible. Greta Gerwig proves to be a competent director with Lady Bird being her directorial debut film. I've seen her act in a film called 20th Century Women and she's not a bad actor, but this film Lady Bird shows her skills behind the camera. She wrote the script and directed Lady Bird and she proves that she is able to produce a wonderful film with as a director and a screenwriter. 

This film tells a coming-of-age story in an interesting way by having a young female lead, Saoirse Ronan, play ""Lady Bird"" who has conflicts with her mother due to their different personalities and outlook on life. The transition between scenes flows nicely and these scenes show ""Lady Bird's"" experiences and how those experiences affect her life and make her a grow into a better person. The script just works so well with the way Greta Gerwig directed this film. Gerwig wrote the script as well and it just goes to show that she wrote the script in such a way where she was already envisioning how she was going to direct the film and how scenes would transition into each other.

I have to particularly praise Saoirse Ronan's performance as Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson. She is a great actress with exceptional talent in acting. She had a well-deserved nomination for Best Actress at the 90th Academy Awards.

This film is a masterpiece and an impressive directorial debut from Greta Gerwig.

dxzvlre,"I've always had a healthy relationship with my parents and some of Christine's decisions baffled me. Her being ashamed of being lower-middle class, telling her dad to drop her off far from school... I hated her for that. 

Anyway , there were two lines that resonated with me and I'm going to paraphrase. First was ""Some people aren't built happy"". I didn't really get why Christine suddenly wanted to be close to Jenna. Now as someone who's been depressed, it's hard to explain why sometimes. You're just like that. Sometimes there's no trigger. You're just a lonely person. I feel you Julie. :(

And last. When the nun said that love is giving attention (?), which is basically the overarching theme in the movie. Jenna and Coolio (sorry had to do it) were both indifferent with Christine on their way to the prom. There's no love there.

That theme is a strong message for me and tells us of the relationship most parents have with their children. Moms might annoy kids and vice-versa, but at the end of the day, it's all love, man.

Btw that abortion talk in the gym. Wtf lady bird",7doxvl
dvjvblk,"Eh. 

It’s just another coming-of-age indie movie with a quirky soundtrack, pretty unlikable main character, period setting that hardly impacts the overall plot and message (up until the last 15 minutes where this lack of social media basically ends her friendship with Julie after high school) and parents who never smile because they’re going through shit and take it out on their kids. 

The big advantage this movie has is that it’s pretty funny. But it couldn’t escape how cliched it felt and how similar it was to other movies (particularly Landline and Napoleon Dynamite).

But a great film, a masterpiece? No

Its too lacking in focus, too all over the place to land a punch. For one thing, I was confused by how on the surface this girl was supposedly a 'maverick' yet in so many ways seems almost stereotypically average (obsessing with her friend over magazine ideas of beauty and perfect houses). One could label this as 'depth' but I felt like it was lack of discipline in the writing. 

If this film is a semi-autobiography of the 'making' of an actress (as the writer/director is) I saw very little in the movie to indicate that. The secondary character of the girls' first boyfriend seems 'clearer' on that score.

The scenes with the girl and her parents are terrific (Tracy Letts, the father, is particularly good IMO) , but so much of the film is not about that it muddles the point.

The film reminded me so much of my mom and mine’s relationship. I really want to take her to see this but I don’t want her to take it the wrong way.

Even the way Lady Bird acted in her relationships reminded me of myself. The way she tried to hide her lack of wealth from the people she wanted to impress. The aloof but loving father. The disappointment in her first time. The way she interacted with her best friend. Moving away for school and finally appreciating all that your mom has done for you. I could go on. It hit the mark on every level where it counts.

Might be my favorite movie of all time. Honestly! I cried throughout the movie but when the credits rolled I started bawling like a baby, I don’t think my date knew what to do!

Beautiful film. I will be seeing it again soon.",7doxvl
dqi9smm,"Okay, here's what I don't get.  A lot of people that really like this movie say they like it because it was an accurate representation of their own coming of age experience.  They also went to an all girls catholic school, yada yada yada.  I don't understand that mentality.  If someone made a movie that mirrored my high school experience, I still don't think I would actually like it.  My experience was not exceptional or all that interesting, so translating that into a 90 minute film just feels like an exercise in masturbatory self indulgence.  I understand I'm not the target audience for the film, yet I'm still having a very hard time understanding why there is such great appeal among those who are in the target demographic.",7doxvl
dqqanyn,"This film, to me, sort of exposes the issue I have with rotten tomatoes. When a film is just better than mediocre, it's RT score may be inflated. Was this is bad movie? Absolutely not. Was it a great movie? Absolutely not. Was it above average? For sure. As a result of this film being slightly better than mediocre, the score of 100% is way too high for what it is. It pops out at you but it really just shows you that it wasn't a polarizing film. One thing I really didn't like about it was that it had one of those pretentious non-endings that we see so much nowadays.",7doxvl
duui5xc,"Came into this film with high expectations, ended up disappointed. Couldn't relate to the main character at all, didn't feel sympathy for her and didn't understand what she had achieved by the end of the film. I don't get the hype. 

4/10",7doxvl
dqnna2w,"A lot of accolades for this, but I saw it yesterday and it was just okay for me. I mean, I liked it a lot, in general. But I guess I was expecting something more meaningful, funnier, more emotional... It had all of that stuff in it, but kind of sporadically and thinly, and felt disjointed in some ways, too. I kept waiting for something more interesting or deep to develop, thematically, but it only barely did.

For a comparable type of story, Edge of Seventeen from last year is much better in almost every respect. Sure, Lady Bird is a little more realistic (based on the writer/director’s life), but real life doesn't mean more interesting/engaging in this case. I thought Edge17 had a much better payoff in terms of the relationship with the mother and brother and friend. It went somewhere and elevated and explored its issues and dialogue and interactions better. It had many impactful moments and much more interesting characters, especially the main character. Lady Bird (the character) is a little quirky, but just kind of goes through stuff with little that really defines or distinguishes her all that well. A few hours later and I don’t remember much about her character.

I hesitate to say that it’s overhyped. It’s good. I just don’t think it’s fantastic. And I do find Saoirse Ronan very charming, but I had about the same feeling from Brooklyn, which she starred in two years ago; good but not as fantastic as everyone seemed to be saying. So I’ll go into her next film with some tempered expectations and maybe I’ll love it.",7doxvl
dr84gmj,"I have to say that I was totally unimpressed with this film. Yes it was realistic, but I don't think that in itself is a major accomplishment. The characters didn't really go much of anywhere and the only interesting facet was the relationship between the teenager and the Mom, which was still well undercooked. If I wanted absolute reality I'd just think of my own life, it's actually far more interesting than anything in this movie. Overall just oozing with sappy sentimentality and a lack of purpose. I can't fathom why it is so well regarded except to say that the standard has dropped so low that this is now considered ""amazing."" ",7doxvl
dpzvqfo,"This movie was amazing, Greta directed a masterpiece for kids who grew up I. The early 2000s.

BTW, [her jr high school photo](http://imgur.com/MOKA1pl)",7doxvl
dqth66l,"Absolutely adored this, so much so that it's my film of the year. There was just something so inviting, warm, and nostalgic about this story. The dynamic between Laurie Metcalf and Saoirse Ronan was stunning, but I actually found myself especially drawn to the bond between Lady Bird and Larry (her father). Their unique love for each other, without any hiccups, was a great offset to the unpredictable and intense bond that Lady Bird shared with her mother. 

But in reality, the entire cast was perfect. Lucas Hedges gave another incredible performance and I really appreciated how Greta utilized Danny [after the breakup between him and Lady Bird](#spoiler). [Even after he comes out as gay, there's still a strong connection between him and Lady Bird, and I'm so glad Greta decided to highlight that friendship later in the film after their graduation.](#spoiler). Odeya Rush was spectacular, and the chemistry between her and Saoirse made their friendship not only believable but kept me invested. 

The cinematography was a highlight for me as well. The horizontal panning shots reminded me of Wes Anderson, and the use of bright pastels and warm colors made the film welcoming to the eyes. If *La La Land* brought Los Angeles to life, then *Lady Bird* is an ode to Sacramento. 

Above all of this, the story remains my favorite part of this film. I can relate to Lady Bird's relationship with her mother, and her struggle to find herself during her senior year of high school. I went through that as well. Maybe it's because I experienced such events not that long ago (relatively), and maybe that's why I enjoyed this story so much. However, I think anyone can find something to relate to and latch on to in this film, and that's what makes it my favorite of the year. 10/10. ",7doxvl

dt30tj3,"It was good, not amazing. The lead performance is great (along with the mother's) but nothing else really stands out. The film is weirdly paced like there were a lot of quick scenes of characters doing things rapidly cut together. Like 10 seconds of christmas, 5 seconds of new years, 20 seconds of them high. I wish more time was spent on some scenes instead of trying to shove in as many life moments as possible stitched together. I think Edge of Seventeen is a much better coming-of-age film and it's strange Lady Bird is getting all the acclaim instead. It's a lovely film though.",7doxvl
dpzqe7p,"Man, Laurie Metcalf knocked it out of the park as Lady Bird's mom. There were so many subtle things she did with her performance that totally made you feel for her. Easily one of my favorites of the year, I can't wait to see what Greta Gerwig does next.",7doxvl

dqco62c,"Let’s discuss mom. Abusive? Emotionally dysfunctional? Tough but loving? What are your thoughts? I think she was emotionally dysfunctional. She had the best intentions for her daughter but being critical was easier than being loving. The scene in the thrift store — in the midst of an argument they suddenly have a synchronized moment of mother/daughter harmony in finding that cute dress. That was a very telling scene. Mom really never showed her love in words. Words were hard. How many letters does she crumple up? Dad gets it though which is why he pulled them out of the trash and put them in that envelope,  That same emotional dysfunction is seen in Lady Bird too. Why else does she suddenly unfriend Julie then reappear at her apartment as if nothing happened? ",7doxvl

dqu4pi0,"Absolutely beautiful movie that had me wrapped up in Lady Bird's every up and down.

The only issue I had with the movie was the incomplete narrative, not necessarily with Lady Bird's story because that's life, but with how we were supposed to feel for her first boyfriend, her first school play director, her best friend. These were stories that deserved a more meaningful close. Because A) the first boyfriend deserved an artistic ending considering how we were supposed to feel for him, B) I honestly have no idea why the scene with the school play director with her mom was there because I may have missed what he was ""not supposed to tell"" her (was it the story about his child?), why did we need the story line? C) the best friend deserved a scene in which they said good bye and parted ways; if this was a coming of age, she should've said goodbye properly. There are lot of other resolutions that were put off that I just attribute to ""life"", which is fair, e.g. her dad's situation, her connection with her mom, these are things I can live with, but the other story lines felt incomplete outside of the artistic touch on the main narrative.

What was put on screen was artistic, beautiful, and touching. I'm just disappointed by what was left out of the film.",7doxvl

Overall, it was funny, endearing and they did a great job with making us empathize with Lady Bird even if she wasn't totally being rational (that was one of my biggest issues with Edge of Seventeen, which I still liked but Nadine in that movie got herself into situations and just acted too bratty for me not to empathize with her during those moments).

drt38vd,"This movie was generic as the last movie about a teenage white girl coming to age, the Hailee Steinfeld one. There is a scene where the coach priest guy goes full Coach Hines, it was literally like Coach Hines from MadTv. I think the Florida Project should had more promotion than this film because it was more meaningful in its humanistic approach. I am a fan of Greta's recent acting from the past few years but this reminds me of her early work with Swansberg, slow and indie cliché. Metcalf was a breathe of fresh air in this movie big time, I miss seeing her in roles like these. ",7doxvl
dtf5sfi,"I am a male and while I can appreciate the good acting in this film I felt it was very woman, emotional centered. The high school coming of age thing is just so overdone, not many new fresh takes on it, and this one wasn't much either. So while I appreciated the subject matter, it has nothing new to offer, AT ALL. Seriously. SuperBad offered just as much insight into the High School experience.  But anyway, this made me feel that it's overhyped for awards season and definately not deserving of Best Picture. Maybe directing and acting on Ronan's part. But that's it. ",7doxvl
dpzsniu,"My problem with this movie is that is moved too fast. Moments that were sentimental and touching just flew by without letting me absorb them.

I stayed at home to commute to college, majored in a safe major, got a safe job that I hate. They don't write movies about people that stay at UC Davis. 

Also I was trying to figure out why I liked this movie so much more than age of seventeen, which is essentially the same movie. I couldn't think of concrete reasons why ",7doxvl

Mine is probably 3 Billboards. ",7doxvl
dtdciug,Spoilers Ahead: 6/10 Alright movie. A great performance from Laurie Metcalf and a solid performance from Saoirse Ronan. Its main problem is its cliches and weak plot lines. The whole story of Lady Bird changing from an outcast to a loser could have worked a little. But how they wrote the shift was fucking stupid. And that whole plot line bothered me. I didn't think the relationship with Timothee Chalamet character Kyle worked. It was weak. The scenes with Lady Bird and Lucas Hedges were some of my favorite. With that being said I still enjoyed the movie and I understand why people love it.,7doxvl

There were about 4 different moments in the third act where things resolve nicely and I thought the film was ending, but it transitions into a new scene instead. The actual scene it ends with was just a bit weaker than some of those others.

One thing that got to me while watching was the small story that happened for Father Leviatch (the first drama teacher), and like all of the other characters his was great, but unlike all of the others I feel that we didn't get to see any kind of closure for him. His last scene was the tail end of a conversation with mama bird, and it was vague due to the scene starting mid-conversation, but hinting that he was having suicidal thoughts. And we don't see him or even hear about him again. As far as I could tell it seemed that 'he would be okay', and I'm wondering why that scene is even there other than to garner emotion from the audience. Any thoughts? ",7doxvl

The storytelling is top shelf but it seems wasted to tell the story of  such inane, immature, ungrateful, cuntish character, specially when there is no resolution at the end, coming of age for me requires a bearing correction and in this case there isn't one, only a very insincere voice message call. To Ronan's performance's credit, i despised her character more every fucking second.

Two things I didn't like, however: Hedges, the male theater actor, turns out to be gay. For a film that attempts to sidestep the dramatic revelations that are expected within this genre, this one stuck out like a sore thumb with its cliche development. Hedges is fantastic and manages to work with it from thereon out (the guy has such warmth), but good lord did that bug me.

Also, the theater teacher seemed like he walked out of a John Hughes movie or something. His emotional bursts just felt off, and the subsequent gym teacher that filled in made matters far worse.",7doxvl

Lady Bird captures what a lot of teenagers feel especially as they are getting ready to go to college, and her parents are perfect as well - one wanting her to stay close, the other just wanting the best even if that means moving away, but knowing what that means as well. The emotions going through the mom (who should definitely get a supporting actress nom) after finding out Lady Bird is going to NYC, and then realizing at the airport she won't see her daughter for a while. How Lady Bird realizes she can't do everything herself and can't always be the center of attention.

I feel this movie is basically the perfect movie, especially in the coming-of-age genre, and I can't wait to see more from Greta and Saoirse as well.",7doxvl

dvhh77q,"Feels like this movie got over hyped a looot due to the revent #metoo stuff and focus on women in hollywood. It was a solid film but in the end very insignificant and lacking any depth and substance or meaning.
The main character was also a way too self obsessed and cringey girl, insisting on being called Lady Bird was just too cringe inducing. She was also a pretty annoying insecure person, with no real principles, selling out and dumping her good friends to be with the cool and popular kids. 
Again it wasn't bad as such, but it was just kind of a pointless movie about a pointless character that thought she was unique and special, but she was just very insignificant and average. Maybe it was more like the writer/director's own youth she felt she wanted to express.",7doxvl
dqhq9dt,"This movie is definitely overrated. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, but not 10/10 material. I think the critics are giving it a free pass for having a female director. Personally, I'd give it a 7/10. The aesthetics were good, but otherwise the movie felt really unfocused and was just a random string of events that could happen to any senior in high school. The supporting characters should have been developed a little bit better instead of just getting a ""sampling"" of many different characters. Also, I felt like the movie should have been more focused on certain plots rather than just meandering around everywhere (which made the film seem way too rushed). The movie also ended very abruptly. They should have either ended the movie before Lady Bird when to NYC or extended the time in NYC. It's weird for a film to introduce a new environment for a character and then suddenly end...

The whole movie is Lady Bird ditzing around with fights with her mother mixed in... then at the end it seemed like the creators remembered it was supposed to be about the two, which was why the ending about the mother felt so out of place. Lady Bird and her mom yelling at each other isn't character development, I would of rather it been more focused on just Lady Bird.",7doxvl

My grandma was hella overprotective of me for the next sixteen years until I went to college. Her brand wasn’t telling me where I could go, but telling me she needed to be at every single event I attended in high school until I put my foot down for senior prom. At the time, we fought a LOT. I didn’t want her around all the time, and she didn’t want to let my mom down raising me. She was so worried I’d get hurt. I lost my grandma this year, and this movie just reminded me how much I fucking miss her. I cried at the happy moments between Lady Bird and her mom. I cried at the sad moments, too.

She never let the audience get comfortable by editing into the scene, she just holds back and lets us experience it all at once, in real time.

Overall I feel like I fall more into #2. It's a solid movie with stellar performances, performances that lift it passed the mediocrity of the script and directing. I have some pretty big pacing and writing problems with it, especially in the last act of the movie where, at one point, they seemingly drop every single subplot and rush through Lady Bird going off to college and having her first New York experience. 

It's a relatable, fun movie but I don't see why it's getting so much high praise compared to, for example, The Big Sick (which is getting high praise in its own right but like isn't breaking RT records despite being more original and just as relatable to certain crowds)",7doxvl

I think the scene with the nun talking about the college essay was really pivotal, where she describes Lady Bird's obvious love of Sacramento. I think the line was, ""Have you considered they might be the same thing? Love and attention?"" 

Lady Bird's mother cares SO MUCH about her, about her future and her safety and yes, even her happiness, that it has turned into this convoluted, obsessive, unhealthy pressure. I saw the exact same thing happen with my mom and sister, who are very alike and clashed all the time, but it wasn't because there wasn't love there, it was just that there was a lack of patience and compassion to go along with it. 

I can't speak to your specific situation, but it took my sister moving out and gaining her own perspective away from my mom for their relationship to improve, and it still took several years after that for them to really ""get along"". My sister had to let go of her anger, and my mom had to let go of her fear.",7doxvl
dqx1gdf,"yo. I get this. I personally think the mother character(while very well done by Metcalf and somewhat relatable) borders on abusive in many ways.

Like, I think that the mother loves her daughter as a child but not the person that child is. There doesn't seem to be any help in developing into an actual adult. 

I keep reading people say, ""that was the relationship between my mother and me""... and I wonder... how many people would not be talked to by their mother's for months.. .just for applying for college... and how odd that sounds.

ht0hvqk,How’s it going? :),7doxvl
dqx0ybg,"I agree, that was one harsh ass scene.

I guess I just don't understand the mother.. and don't much like her.  Ladybird appears to be the only one trying to open or keep the communications lines open, pretty much the whole movie.

The mother insults her, tells her not to apply to any schools not within 20 minutes drive, and apparently doesn't even fill out the fafsa(school loan papers) because the father sneakily did that.

Ladybird fills out the application herself, pays for it herself, and keeps it to herself because of her mother's derisive comments about this exact thing.

The mother finds out about it and doesn't talk to her own daughter for weeks/months.

Why?

Doesn't finish up any of the letters to talk to her daughter/explain to her daughter.  

why?

Doesn't call or write(granted, we don't know how long she had actually been at school)

why?

why does ladybird have to be the adult in the parent/child relationship?",7doxvl
dqr7lqm,Especially this. I equally enjoy the scenes with Tracy Letts as Lady Bird's father because of the warmth he brings to counterbalance the fights between Lady Bird and her mom. ,7doxvl
dsb5q04,"And the movie presents that truth in a scene: the head sister telling Lady Bird something along the lines of, ""Love and paying attention are the same thing."" In other words: the opposite of love is not hate, but rather, indifference.

The mother ignoring Lady Bird in the scene you described was the hardest to watch because that was when the mother was the complete opposite of love. Even the scene in which the mother told Lady Bird she did not believe in her success, which involved furious, spiteful shouting by both parties was easier to watch. Why? Because the opposite of love is not hate, but rather, indifference.

On the other hand, if you were like me, some of the most beautiful moments showed the inverse of that: how one character paid attention to a second and thus, showed their love for them.

For example, Lady Bird, at the end of her disastrous prom, seeks out her best friend Julie. She is welcomed inside by Julie's mother, wanting Julie's attention to comfort her about Kyle, but then sees that Julie is crying. Immediately, without a thought for herself and the reason why she arrived, Lady Bird is there to comfort Julie once she realizes her friend's depression (mirroring her realisation of her own father's depression and her inability at that time to understand and help). This shows how deep down, Lady Bird truly loves her best friend.

In addition: The scene in which Lady Bird is finally ready to confront Danny about his ""betrayal"" of her. She is ready to demand his attention, but as soon as she mentions and Danny reveals his true fear of being unable to come out to his parents, Lady Bird immediately is ready to comfort him and provide him support, showing how loving and empathetic she is of him.

And, although you see many of her extensive flaws (such as her ability to manipulate other people for her own ends), because she is capable of such levels of love and empathy, she thus redeems herself.

The mother is also an example of this. The morning after Lady Bird loses her virginity, her mother arrives to take her home. The mother seems about to yell at Lady Bird for her ""transgression"", but when she sees how upset Lady Bird is over Kyle's lie, she immediately begins to cry with her daughter and embraces her, giving her love and attention.

And this thread leads into another. Both the mother and Lady Bird are flawed, but yet, are humanizing in the same way. They both are able to put others' needs before their own. This is parallel to the final scene in which Lady Bird described driving on the roads of Sacramento for the first time, how that connected to her home. And the scene transitions between moments of Lady Bird driving and her mother driving, presenting the thought that they truly are mother and daughter. And the fact that they both have the same redeeming aspect of being able to put others' needs before their own also presents this parallel.

I just didn't know how to feel about the movie, nothing really resonated with me like it did with everyone else. I don't think anything was *bad,* but a lot of things felt iffy to me.

 I think the acting was excellent, but the characters they were playing didn't feel as realistic as people say they felt; Lady Bird's character is one I can imagine, but as someone who, even for being a teenage girl, is still quite emotional and melodramatic, and I think that made it a little hard to connect with her. The fights she had with her mom seemed like they would be a big deal, but then they would be more or less resolved, then pick up again, and then with her mother cutting her off for good at the end before suddenly missing her, I didn't know how to feel in terms of a resolution to those conflicts. 

To me the best moments were the few where the super fast pace slowed down a bit, like when her first boyfriend is crying on her shoulder, when the priest is talking with her mother, and some of the interactions she had with her dad. Those moments are what really resonated with me, but unlike what a lot of people are saying here, they made the rest of the rapid fire gags and dramatic moments seem disjointed in comparison. I don't mean to be so critical, it was a good film, but not at all what I was expecting. 

One final note is that I'm currently a senior in high school, so my (lack of) experience and perspective may very well warp my understanding of the movie. But with that in mind, it seemed like although I see where these teen characters' tropes and flaws come from, they seemed exaggerated from many of my peers in real life. ",7doxvl

dq0u67a,"This might be some part of what felt slightly off about the movie to me as well. I was torn between looking at it two different ways;

On the one hand it could be seen as somewhat sloppy editing or a poor stylistic choice, pretty straightforwardly what you're talking about.

It also occurred to me that it might have been intended/best interpretted as a way to show the ebb and flow of time, emotion, and relationships between Lady Bird and the people in her life. The movie doesn't take place over a very long period of time, but months do pass, and to some extent the editing may have helped to convey that feeling that in some way we *are* seeing varyingly independent vignettes over a transitional point in her life. More interestingly though, I think, was the people/relationship side of this; just as it sometimes felt like a scene would cut away in a rather abrupt or divisive way, so Lady Bird's relationships with people, especially her mother, fluctuated and cut to sometimes drastic extremes. This feeling of discontinuity resonated with me as a reflection of how people are sometimes so inconsistent in how they treat those closest to them at different times, and whether or not it was a deliberate effect, I can't help but think there might be something to the idea that this movie did an interesting job of materializing that idea.

What I did like about the film is that characters like Kyle aren't one note villains - the guy had potential as a human being and was going through a very difficult time with a dying father, but he wasn't emotionally equipped to be a good boyfriend and person at this point in his life.

If you thought the character of Kyle was comedic, I'm surprised you didn't think the same of the coach. The humor in both is that each is a complete caricature of a role: the self-proclaimed anarchist ""cool guy"" who is a contradiction (i.e. attending a private Catholic school that his wealthy parents pay for), and the coach who is consistently in a ""motivating sports coach"" attitude to the point of drawing sports diagrams on the dry erase board to substitute for stage directions.",7doxvl

And the character Lady Bird was so well-crafted. Charismatic and confident, manipulative and self-serving, compassionate, spiteful, empathetic. I believe she is an example of what it means to be a person who is truly good. Her final interactions with Julie and Danny each show how she puts others' needs ahead of her own. Lady Bird provides comfort, rather than demanding it herself, when others are in need.

Each storyline seemed to follow a fairly mundane path, until it shifted due to some believable twist: Lady Bird's relationship with Danny and discovering that he is gay; Lady Bird constantly arguing with her brother until she says exactly what he needs to hear to put in effort to achieve success; Lady Bird's relationship with her father until discovering he has depression and requesting his help to apply for New York universities; Lady Bird's friendship with Julie and leaving her behind to become popular for Kyle until becoming disillusioned, and similarly discovering Julie's depression and comforting her.

These are several themes and reasons that elevated this movie in my mind. ""Lady Bird"" became my favourite movie immediately upon reaching the film's credits.",7doxvl
dvgyxjw,"I think the reason her mum needed her to grow up faster is because of their financial issues and her father’s health. Majority of teenagers in western countries are given the chance to still remain kids while still exploring life but there are the unfortunate unlucky ones who cone from single-parent families, financially weak families or other scenarios that’s aren’t so ideal. This film portrays that perfectly. Lady Bird was just a kid finding herself but her mum needed her to mature faster for very valid reasons. Neither were wrong, they were both just struggling.",7doxvl

I would say you're the demographic it is not meant for. It's more for parents and daughters. My father and mom both really liked it (saw it with them separately, as they're divorced), because it reminded all of us of my dynamic with them at 16 - 17.

I totally see where he (and you) are coming from though the story seemed relevant to me, being a 33 year old male.  

I really liked it and, other than the ending, thought it was a really strong movie. Would not put it as an Oscar contender for film of the year but really good.

dtygwj4,"I don't think it was over-hyped. I heard it was great, went in with high hopes. But I did not expect to be so moved by a movie.

**Now I should preface this with a PSA: 90% of the time someone sees a movie in theaters they don't like it, then they see it again a year later on Netflix and start to like it and appreciate [source: my rectum and personal observations]. I think this is because not enough people actually go to a movie theatre *by themselves,* so when they leave they don't get a chance to sit with it before their friend starts talking about it.**

Okay, now with that said, I saw it by myself and gave my brain to the director. I probably like it because I related to it so well. The scene where the mother is silently washing the dishes while Lady Bird is screaming for her attention almost had me in tears, it brought back a lot of frustration and helpless desperation that I personally experienced as a teen, but I think for a broader audience it really exemplifies the point that mother thinks she knows what's ""best"" but in reality it's demoralizing and traumatizing for your child who really is still dependent on you despite trying to become their own person.

The things she went through with school and boyfriends and the popular crowd, all yes and yes and yes. She's experimenting with so many different identities. The depressed father who shows this heart-warming unconditional support and love for his daughter without ever seeing the personal toll it takes on him shows how the father, a soft-spoken character who bends to his wife, followed the ""right"" path in life and it gave him a humble yet depressing life. And then when Lady Bird tells the guy at the end she's from San Francisco because he doesn't know where Sacramento is, I think that was fucking brilliant because it reveals that her old identity is an ambiguous blur of the past to other people in her new city (and as someone who has lived in 5 different cities in the last 5 years, I can tell you I do that all the time). 

What was most beautiful about the film though was at the end, when shots of Lady Bird and her mom flash between each other as they do the same drive in their home town, and it really comes through that her psycho mom was like her once, struggling to find her identity, and just did what she did out of love because she didn't want her daughter to end up having the same life she did. 

I walked out of that fucking theatre with goosebumps. It just perfectly captured the REAL transition from child to adulthood. The angst, the desperation, the loneliness, the lack of appreciation for what you have until it's gone, and some insight in to what it's like being a parent while your child is going through that shit. I wanted to call my parents afterward myself.",7doxvl
dtv0s84,"Just watched it tonight - I think that, as is becoming common with well-made movies and the Internet nowadays, yes, it was overhyped to a level it wasn't going to reach.

If I knew nothing about it going in, I probably would've been over the moon with this movie.",7doxvl
du9tpzk,"We're on the same page about the movie. I went into it blind without knowing about the hype and what is hilarious is that I actually thought about how the movie kind of reminded me of Juno while I was watching it, right down to her first boyfriend having a bit of a resemblance to Michael Cera.

The movie was very well done and there is not a single bad line throughout. However, I think for me the overarching story was too simple and it held the movie back for me. Another coming of age story I really like is Almost Famous, and I would watch that over this movie for the sole reason that the story is quite a bit bigger than Lady Bird's. 

The point of this movie definitely isn't about the story though, it's the characters, but I think it would've earned that 100% for me if it just managed to have that on top of a larger story. That's just my preference though. By no means does that make it a bad movie, and lacking a larger story definitely doesn't take away the fact that Lady Bird is insanely relatable.",7doxvl

It was a good effort, even a great one, but nothing extraordinary. The story seemed VERY familiar and I kept feeling like I'd seen this movie before. The whole ""I'm gonna ditch my nerdy best friend to hang out with cool kids and pretend like I'm someone I'm not and then discover my true self and go to tje prom with my best friend"" story arc was very by-the-books and predictable.

driu4d0,"One thing I really enjoyed was how the movie wasn't some big story wrapped up in a 2 hour capsule where the credits roll and everything is a-okay now. It was about Lady Bird's life and you could really get a sense for the time before the movie started and then after it finished you could feel like there was going to be more to her life. It wasn't the case where the credit roll and everything stops sorta thing if that makes sense. Like if the whole movie is all about just one thing then at the very end that thing comes true and then credit roll. This was just a 2 hour condensed showing of this girls last 2ish years of highschool into college and I think that helped with the realism of it because it was so familiar to everyone. And the character were familiar at least to me as well because everyone felt like an actual person with redeeming characteristics and faults- no just one hero or whatever.
Tbh I think it really just comes down to how well you connect to the characters, because even though Lady Bird was the main character I went on for most of the movie in this weird balance was disliking her a whole lot but at the same time wishing I could just reach through the screen and give her a hug bc her mom wasn't doing that for her.

The fact that she had a special connection to Sacramento was kinda a major plot point, and not one that was very subtle. And yes she spent a long time trashing Sacramento in the movie, but she's a rebellious teenager... teenagers say that about wherever they grow up.

dtpzegz,"I grew up in Sacramento and it brought me a lot of joy to watch Lady Bird!

Sacramento can be a really beautiful city with it's trees and older buildings, and its rivers.  Some of the things in the film, I connected with strongly:

She walked through some of the beautiful, rich homes in the ""Fabulous Forties"" which is a neighborhood of older homes that starts with 40th street. As a teenager, I would walk past some of those homes and dream about being able to go inside one. Being able to ""go inside"" one of these homes during the Thanksgiving scene was somehow soul fulfilling.

Lady Bird probably went to ""St. Francis"" which is the girl's catholic school. The boy's catholic school, Jesuit, is several miles away on the other side of the river. These are both private schools and it would have taken a big chunk of money and sacrifice for parents the parents in the film to send their daughter there.

The rose garden at McKinley Park is really lovely and you can walk around the roses, go for a run, etc.

I cracked up laughing when she mentioned walking around Pavillions. Pavillions is a small, outdoor mall with small, luxury stores. Parents who could afford to send their kids to private school, can most likely afford to shop here. I used to window browse here, but I never ever bought anything from these stores.

The rich girl from Granite Bay made me laugh because she probably had a long 20+ minute commute to get to school. Granite Bay, located close to Folsom Lake, features some wealthy, newer homes, more in the style of McMansion variety.    

I really identified with her family's sense of lack of money in comparison to the wealth around them. By sheer luck and my parents' sacrifice, I grew up in a safe neighborhood on the other side of the river, in the newer track homes section. I went to schools where kids had so much more money than me. It certainly made me feel different and perhaps less inclined to be friends with the people who had more money. My mom tried to fit in, sometimes by thrift shopping and finding expensive clothes that were probably donated by some of the wealthier neighbors. If you didn't have a new car or you didn't wear a certain brand of clothes, there would certainly be other kids who would make fun of you for it.

I understand her wanting to get away from Sacramento. It's so beautiful there, but it's almost like it's a town that you settle in and grow old in vs a town where you find yourself. If you feel oppressed or feel like everyone is the same there, then it's not a city for you to be in. It really is the Midwest of California, or whatever she said in the movie.  

I really like the memories of growing up in Sacramento, but ultimately, I'm happy that I live somewhere else.

Her mom was annoying though. You are stopping your daughter from achieving her dreams. She is ambitious and trying to do her best, she should be proud with her for that. Instead she feels so arrogant and never appreciates her daughter. Always telling her you belong to a poor family. Its so annoying.

Now with that being said, I could not connect or give a shit about Lady Bird or her family at the end.  That comment from the nun read about ""attention being love"" really drove this message home for me: it doesn't matter how much your mother emotionally abuses (invalidates, insults, ignores) you, as long as she does a pretty good job over all.  This is an impotent message about love (imo) and explains why Lady Bird's character is never able to make strong, understanding relationships (besides her dad who is a total enabler of annoying women).  She never achieves empathy and only reunites with her (only true friend) Julie because she doesn't want to go to prom alone.  At the end, she is finally in her dream destination (New York) and still has a shitty time there because... I don't know.  And I don't care.

dq5tjs3,"> And for those who have seen it, WTF was with that final sequence of the girl getting drunk to the point of near-death?  That made no sense to me at all.

What didn't make sense about it? She's in a new place and is branching out and being irresponsible like all college students do. Also selling out her hometown by saying she was from San Francisco.  And after that experience, she longs for a small slice of home that she could find in the big city, which is why she goes to the church. 

I mean, there's so many different ways for that sort of thing to play out so it could have been less quirky but it wasn't nonsensical. ",7doxvl
dq7ib2f,"> For one thing, I was confused by how on the surface this girl was supposedly a 'maverick' yet in so many ways seems almost stereotypically average (obsessing with her friend over magazine ideas of beauty and perfect houses). One could label this as 'depth' but I felt like it was lack of discipline in the writing.

I wouldn't consider that a lack of discipline at all! I thought it was very intentional and I think it helped me understand the character better, and feel for her, and relate to her, and in that way be embarrassed for her in the same way I'm embarrassed about my younger self. 

When you're young you act out in stupid ways even when (or maybe *because*) you are (and feel) incredibly average. You dye your hair red like Lady Bird, or you scream in the middle of the road after a first kiss like Lady Bird, or you give yourself a stupid nickname like ""Lady Bird."" I think all of those things that made her average and cringey also made her human and relatable.

I don't think this movie was a semi-autobiography about the ""making"" of an actress, or about the relationship between a mother and daughter (and apparently the working title was *Mothers and Daughters*), or about the way our homes become a part of us whether we want them to or not. 

I think it's a lot like another great movie with Saoirse Ronan in it, *Brooklyn*, which is (in my opinion) not entirely about a love story or the immigrant experience. I think that both of these movies are beautiful coming-of-age pieces about how hard it is to feel like you belong and about coming to terms with who you are and your place in the world. I think everything in the movie worked towards that, whether it was her ebbing and flowing relationship with her best friend, her floundering in drama to be near a boy, or her fighting with her mother. I think it just painted a wonderful picture of growing up as a girl and trying to navigate that difficult path to becoming a woman (I guess, I don't know, I'm a dude). 

All that being said, I am also a bit perplexed by the drinking scene at the end. I kind of get it. I think it was meant to show her indulgence in a certain lifestyle maybe, or her coping with being so far from everything she's ever known. And ultimately I think it was meant to show her at a low point afterwards, to allow her to reflect on who she is and why she is there, and to finally really appreciate her mother and her home for what they are and gave her. But all in all I think it felt like a rushed ending to a movie that was such an enjoyable and charming ride for me that I don't really think it needed to have a rushed ending.

I would agree with you that the movie isn't a masterpiece. But as far as coming-of-age movies about average young girls that I've seen, I think it is at the top of the list. I liked it more than Ghost World, Diary of a Teenage Girl, An Education, and maybe Juno. I found it incredibly endearing, well-paced, and funny. Sure, it hit almost every possible cliche imaginable, but I feel like it did it with a lot of grace, a sense of humor, and a sensitive humanity that made up for it. Again, I wouldn't call it a *masterpiece*, but I'd say it's pretty darn good, and I think that Greta Gerwig, Saoirse Ronan, and everyone else involved deserve appreciation for it. ",7doxvl
dq5r3zq,"Agree. I like the narration and overall feel of the movie. But unfortunately the protagonist does not seem to be full of depth / likable traits. While there is an effort to make her special and weird, I have to agree that she is rather ""average"". Her parents and friends, however, are pretty well-written side characters. I love the scenes with the girl and her parents, they are rather powerful. I never really get the [last hangover scene](#spoiler), makes the character even more unlikable. I guess that's Greta's true experience?",7doxvl
dqox1dk,"So I generally agree with you that it was good, not great. 

But to answer your questions. It's an autobiographic film by the writer/director Greta Gerwig. Maybe it's humility, self-deprecation, or a poor self-image of herself but she didn't want to write herself as amazing, to that end I think I'd give Greta more credit as a writer, not less. 

I guess the last scene rings more true if you went to a college like Barnard. At my own school I certainly saw freshmen who aren't used to drinking get in over their head, and then - scared because they had never been that drunk before - call 911 instead of sleeping it off.  My wife and I were laughing our asses off during that scene because we'd seen it play out in real life before. I strongly suspect that it's something that either happened to Greta or she saw, I'm not sure it was there for an artistic purpose other than authenticity of the ""new freshmen"" experience, and got the character a little space for those last scenes.

IMO, the mother was mostly right about her daughter.  Lady Bird was  an inconsiderate, selfish ""me, me, me, it's all about me"" person - i.e., the typical American teenage girl.

I think we see that a bit in the whole ""favorite Sunday activity"" of going and touring huge, beautiful houses.

> Has Lady Bird never heard of student loans?

Yes. She mentions loans at one point as a possible way to afford college in New York.

> Is the writer aware that you don't fill out a FAFSA for specific schools?

I don't think her dad was saying he filled out different forms for different schools. He just handed her the envelope with the completed forms in it for her to submit.

> Why was Julie crying on the night of prom?

This wasn't explored that much throughout the movie, or at least I didn't catch it if it was, but I think Julie suffered from depression. She says something to the effect of ""not everyone is built/made happy"" when Lady Bird asks her why she's crying.

> Why was Father Leviatch at the hospital ...

It seemed to me like he was having suicidal thoughts stemming from the death of his wife and son. And he asked Lady Bird's mom not to mention it to Lady Bird or Julie.

> ... and why do we care?

This I'm actually not entirely sure about. Maybe because he was a positive influence for Lady Bird and Julie?

> What did the mother actually write in those letters?

I can't give you a transcript, but they were each different attempts to explain why their relationship was so strained and why she loved Lady Bird despite that strain. Multiple letters began ""Dear Lady Bird,"" and at least one started ""Dear Christine,"" so you could tell she was having a hard time deciding how best to say what she wanted to say.",7doxvl
dq5d2y3,"Interesting; I didn't see the movie as shrugging or laughing off the abuse. I thought it actually did a great job of showing how an abusive relationship like that can be much more nuanced than ""parent emotionally degrades child in every interaction"". Many relationships like the one between Lady Bird and her mother, while certainly abusive and destructive, are borne out of misguided or tragically failed attempts to have healthy, loving relationships. And quite often there will be days or weeks at a time where the relationship seems healthy, fixed, normal. I thought that the back and forth with them wanting to scream at each other one scene and then a couple scenes later seeming to reconcile really portrayed the subtleties of everyday toxic relationship cycles very well.",7doxvl
dr1scb1,"Thank you. You managed to nail every problem I felt with this movie. I kept struggling to figure out why I didn't like it as much as everyone else. Her mother IS abusive.

dq2dmnc,"It really depends on who you ask (though, that is a statement that exists with all art, isn't it?)

I personally HATED ""Edge of Seventeen"". For myself, it was one of the worst films I watched in 2016. Now, I do think it was a well crafted film; it was scripted well, and all of the roles, INCLUDING the lead character, were acted well. My favorite characters in the film were the teacher (so wonderfully played by Woody Harrelson), the brother, and the main character's best friend.

All of that being said, I still HATED the film. The reason being, I couldn't get behind the protagonist of the film in any way. Now, I understand that rather is the point. It's a coming of age film with a lead female character who is so supremely self involved, as most teenagers are in some capacity, that she is destroying everything around her. She's quick to anger, conceited, woefully ignorant and simultaneously a ""know it all"" in all regards, that she is sort of like a hurricane who is creating tsunamis destroying everything else within her view, while being devoid of really any redeeming qualities until the last 10 minutes of the film, which at that point I didn't care.

Due to everything I mentioned (and much more which I won't go into so as not to belabor the point), the film, again to me, was a sweeping two hours of negativity and conceitedness that just felt so disgusting and venomous. And for that, I just could not enjoy the film at all.

However, I thoroughly enjoyed Lady Bird. The lead character, while also exhibiting many of the ""I am the center of the universe"" traits of typical teenagers, still exuded a warmth to her character. Much of that is also probably due to the pacing of the film, which I felt was allowed to breathe much more than ""Edge of Seventeen"". Lady Bird never felt deliberately destructive and self-destructive, but rather just lost with her genuine goodness still having sway on her. She had the same naivete about sexuality, but the film presented it as something she misunderstood about the situation and the other guy, whereas ""Edge of Seventeen"" presented it as the lead character making assumptions about the other person based on nothing but a dream.

Also throughout the film, we had the Mom, played so terrifically by Laurie Metcalf. She was ""antagonistic"" in the sense of just being a parent, albeit one more on the stern side. We saw the conflict between mother and daughter, but so quickly understood that the two really care about each other, do get along at times, and that the conflict in the film between them was quite a bit ideological and borne out of the teenage desire for independence, not purely just from a standpoint of Lady Bird being difficult.",7doxvl
dq4pyhq,"Haha I'm going to go against all the other responses and actually say that 'Edge of Seventeen' was my favourite movie of 2016. Nothing groundbreaking, but very well written, likable characters, charming, and Steinfeld was incredible. The main character is so very flawed but I found myself relating my own character faults to hers, which made it ring true. So I loved it.

What's crazy though is I just watched Lady Bird tonight and I walked out thinking that a.)Would make a great double feature with Edge of Seventeen and covers some of the same territory and b.)Makes Edge of Seventeen look like a sitcom in comparison. Watching Lady Bird makes me like Edge of Seventeen less lol. It was so good.",7doxvl

dsyry1y,"Yeah I can relate to this. My mother and I will sometimes go months without speaking to each other because every fight we have ends up drudging up the past and the terrible things she did. 

When Lady Bird's mother said 'my mother was an abusive alcoholic' it helped me understand her character. Parents that had bad parents themselves can struggle with compassion and understanding their kids. My mum didn't have a good relationship with her own mother growing up, and she vowed to be different, but in a lot of ways she ended up continuing the cycle of abusive parenting, even if it was to a lesser degree than what she experienced.

We judge ourselves by our intentions, but judge others by their actions. I tried to put myself in Lady Bird's mothers shoes to better understand her: bad childhood, constantly struggling financially, and cannot connect with her daughter. But having been on the other side of a similar parent; someone that means well but ends up abusive or borderline abusive when things don't go their way, it was a struggle to not dislike or even hate Lady Bird's mother.

Like I feel like so many of these stories over-exaggerate things left and right to actually be interesting as a film when in reality things are much different. They always come off as trying to be way more profound than that period of your life actually is for many and it's kind of like this weird preachy experience for a few hours.",7doxvl
dv99wk4,"> because we all go through things like this even if we didn't do the exact same things

I agree so much with this. I'm a 21 year old guy who went to public high school and had a completely different experience but I still related to so much of this movie, and to multiple characters. I think there's something universal about coming of age movies in that, no matter who they specifically focus on, there is always someone that people can relate to because adolescence is such a pivotal and emotional time for everyone that there will always be a character with some semblance to the viewer's personal experience. 

In other words, coming of age movies aren't about the main character, they are about every character because it's such a hard time for everyone involved. So it's easy to relate to since there are so many characters with their own struggles.",7doxvl
dq135lx,"I think they have a trend of doing it, like in John Hughes's movies, but I think Lady Bird did a pretty good job of making the experience seem almost realistic.

dsb5yvm,"The mother is not so one-dimensional as you make her seem; no character in this movie (not even the wealthy girl) is.

There were several good moments that the mother had with her daughter. Comforting her after she lost her virginity and taking her on home tours after, supporting the family with her single job after her husband loses her job, taking the effort to write so many drafts of her letter to Lady Bird as she leaves her nest of Sacramento to attend college in New York City.

For every negative scene there is between Lady Bird and her mother, there is a positive scene of equal proportion.

And that is a theme in and of itself: No relationship is entirely good nor bad, because no person is entirely good nor bad.

Edit: The very first scene is a perfect representation of this. Mother and daughter are both crying, sharing an intimate moment after having concluded ""The Grapes of Wrath"". Lady Bird goes to turn on the radio, the mother asks her not to, and they devolve into an argument. Both good and bad aspects of their relationship are shown in a single scene. And the fact that it is the first scene is foreshadowing how their relationship will be shown as both good and bad throughout the remainder of the film.",7doxvl
dt0683h,"I took issue with the mother also. This article I found sums up my feelings pretty well, and it sounds like the author is similarly as unimpressed with Marion as you and I: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/11/lady-bird-isnt-about-a-mother-daughter-relationshi.html

If your relationship with your daughter is contentious, (which is nearly unavoidable in the teen years) why would you EVER not take that glint of an opportunity to share a non-contentious moment with her? The shining example of this is when they are looking for prom dresses together. Her daughter loves the dress, desperately seeks mom's approval, and all mom can muster is: ""Isn't it a little too pink?"" 

Perhaps the point is that some people do go through that kind of brutal psychological abuse from their parents who are so damaged by their own past or insecurities that they can barely function as passingly NICE to their children. It's a real and tragic shame, but I am seeing this relationship dynamic touted as being the typical, complex interactions between a tough-loving mother and her rebellious teen daughter. It is deeper and much more sinister than that. 

Marion shifts the responsibility of her aloof demeanor toward and cruel treatment of Lady Bird to her own alcoholic, abusive mother. She never grows in the course of the story and shuts down all communication with her family (even speaking for the father most of the time) when she does not get her way. She is clearly capable of empathy in her career but cannot provide the same kind of empathy for her own child. It is deeply sad. She is not a character to be liked, but perhaps pitied for her own myopia.

Maybe that was the point of the script. I think the bad taste in my mouth is in finding so many reviewers letting Marion slide.",7doxvl

- Lady Bird calls her brother out on his nose rings and by the end of the movie the brother has cleaned up and got a job 

- all the little details that clue you in on Danny being gay - Wanting to go to France, curling hair, loving theater, etc

- a random girl at the start of the movie talks briefly about the theater directors wife leaving him and his daughter overdosing, and much later on the guy goes in to the hospital to talk to someone about what we assume is deep depression/suicidal desires 

I'm sure there are a few more and this attention to detail is not that atypical of good solid writing, but it did take a 2nd viewing to pick up on a couple of these for me. Great film.

And there were parts I found surprising. The reveal that Danny was gay was edited so nontraditionally, I found it really incredible. They didn't linger in that moment at all, it didn't feel cinematic, they cut it how that moment would feel in real life. That was very interesting to me, and I think the film made lots of interesting choices like that. Maybe you went in too hyped, the 100% RT score and all that. But if every single critic gives something an 8/10, that's a pretty goddamn amazing feat.

dq205vn,"> My experiences in high school were nothing like Lady Bird's, and while I can empathize with the character, it was hard for me to relate.

I don't think it is the similarity of the high school experiences that make this so relatable for people.  I think there are two main coming of age themes in the movie that a lot of people can identify with.

The first theme is that life is happening somewhere else and you are missing out on it.  Lady Bird wants to move from California to New York or even Connecticut which is a fun reversal of a lot of the California fetishizing you see in movies.  It is an obvious grass in greener situation and shows her immaturity.  I think a lot of people who grow up in smaller towns and can't wait to move away can relate to this.

The second theme is what really sets the movie apart in my opinion.  It is having ambitions for your life that you struggle to meet.  Lady Bird sees the life her parents have and wants something better for herself.  But she never really considers that her parents also wanted something better for their own lives (realizing your parents are people with their own hopes and dreams is one of the biggest experiences of becoming an adult).  This struggle for success is hit on multiple times with Lady Bird and her mom discussion in the bathroom and again when shopping for prom dresses.  Most movies would present this simply from Lady Bird's perspective.  However this movie give her mother just as much thought.  It is therefore relatable from both the child and parent perspective and the result is that a wider range of people can identify with it.",7doxvl
dq10yyd,"It isn't really about doing anything new. It's how wonderfully executed everything was. I thought the film did a great job allowing Lady Bird to be awful but also redeem herself in unexpected ways.

dqscgav,"> it might have been intended/best interpretted as a way to show the ebb and flow of time, emotion, and relationships between Lady Bird and the people in her life. The movie doesn't take place over a very long period of time, but months do pass, and to some extent the editing may have helped to convey that feeling that in some way we *are* seeing varyingly independent vignettes over a transitional point in her life.

It almost seems like a recounting of memories later in life. Lady Bird, now in her early 30s, thinks back on her senior year. A lot of the fuzzy details are forgotten, but the things that really matter, or were really special, stick with her. Lying about her math grade, having sex for the first time, getting ice cream with her dad when he didn't get a job.",7doxvl

Aside from the Lady Bird thing, other things didn’t ring true for me. Her screaming fight with her friend at school and yelling about her friend’s mom’s boob job, her cool boyfriend was too edgy, she was too ashamed of her house. Like I’ve never met anyone who lies for no reason about where she lives, like that’s not gonna come back and bite her in the ass. She’s a pretentious, unremarkable, rebel-light, as I suppose many of us are at that age, but I didn’t like her and so the movie never really drew me in.  A+ use of Dave Matthews though.

But hey, different strokes. I think there’s room on the thread for both of our opinions. ",7doxvl
dq12u2l,"To a certain extent I agree with you. Tropes do exist for a reason. Many people struggle to find their place amongst friend groups, many people have a flailing teenage love life, many people strive to be more than what they are, or better than where they’re from. I just think I didn’t like how it handled the tropes. It felt a bit cliché to me (I understand that others do not agree). It’s difficult to parse what I didn’t like without being reductive. 

It just felt like (for all the hype) something was missing, some oomph, some comedy, some drama... I don’t know. I just never felt truly engaged with the main character. I didn’t like her. Maybe that’s part of the point though, that teenagers can be unlikeable brats, and that’s part of growing up. 

I’m rambling, but to reiterate, I don’t think it was a bad movie. I thought it was good, just not, “this is the best movie of the year,” “quintessential coming of age story” good. ",7doxvl

dq30gik,"So to clarify, I’m talking about the movie generally and how it made me feel, which is a personal experience. It didn’t blow me away. It didn’t fully engage me. I was somewhat bored. I found it a bit predictable, cliché, and slightly flat. I spoke about the tropes because those stood out to me and I was trying to give examples of what I didn’t like. I’m not overlooking new things it introduced, just saying that for me, they weren’t redeeming enough to make it amazing. But I still liked it. 

I did understand what her nickname was supposed to say about her character. It’s not just her rebelling and creating her own identity, it’s pretentious. (I get that this is likely deliberate, but it certainly didn’t help me like her character. I know you don’t need to like the main character, but... eh)

Lady Bird is not just a random quirky teenage nickname she made up, it’s a famous nickname of a former First Lady of the United States. I grew up around when Lady Bird did, and personally never experienced people making up their own nicknames (or borrowing others’ nicknames), so it seemed silly *to me*. It would be like if I told everyone to start calling me the Iron Lady. (There is symbolism in why she may have picked this name. Lady Bird Johnson was famous, rich, and powerful. The name itself too:  Lady implies nobility, importance, and elegance, birds fly away freely from the nest...)

Lady Bird considers those questions with honesty, insight, and humor. The protagonist is at times a unique individual and at times the spitting image of her mother. All of this takes place with supporting characters who are all dealing with their own problems and learning and managing as best they can.

Julie also had a confused relationship with men in general, referring to her mom's boyfriend as ""uncle"" and a strange affection for her teacher. She didn't have a date for prom, which was an important event for her as it is for a lot of high school girls. I don't see why she wouldn't be crying...

this film left a lot to be interpreted by the audience, which i found refreshing. They didn't spell out why Julie was crying, or precisely why the drama teacher abandoned his job.

dq4acx5," > This I'm actually not entirely sure about. Maybe because he was a positive influence for Lady Bird and Julie?

I actually think that was a completely beautiful scene because it perfectly was juxtaposed with Lady Bird talking with Danny [about his sexuality.](#spoiler) which came directly before this one. While the film attempts to present Lady Bird and her mother at odds, it also showed that they are cut from the same cloth: they're both empathetic, caring people at their core.  They hear people out, and are receptive of other's hardships.  That's how I interpreted that scene. ",7doxvl

haha this is great. Admittedly, I'm one of those. I loved Lady bird. I also find myself absolutely loving movies that aren't necessarily fast-paced or filled with a really thick plot, just like Ladybird. One thing I can say about Ladybird and movies like it, it's filled with tons of little human moments that are just parts of all of our lives. I may not have experienced it but... I kinda feel like the emotional experience still registers, through the main character. On the other hand, maybe it's just my enormous crush for Saoirse Ronan.",7doxvl

dtqgsve,"i think you are right.

i am an only child of 28 yo who left the country for another to pursue my studies and land a job.

my mother cannot let a day go by without two phone calls a day to ""hear my voice"". if i don't answer, she leaves sobbing messages begging me to reply. we got into fights before when i told her i cannot always be available at the time she wants to reach me. no dice. it stresses me out because it guilts me of leaving my parents behind to carry on with life. not to mention she wants to continue paying for my rent and i suspect it's a way of keeping me on a leash.

parents are human beings too. lady ird is similar to me in a sense she is also their only child (biologically). the mom carried her in her womb so the connection is stronger. the mother was pissed because ladybird was ashamed of her parents who sacrificed a lot for her. notice how many times the mom takes her clothes shopping even with limited budget.

there is this love/hate relationship sometimes with certain parents; how they nitpick everything and drive you nuts but at the same time would rather die than see you sad. there are times where i wonder if i did the right thing by leaving. where i think i am killing my mother slowly by being away and leaving her with no one but my dad. they sacrificed a lot for me to be where i am today and are still doing it. children can be as ungrateful and egotistical as parents can be clingy or clumsy.",7doxvl
dvmmmxy,"I think the truth is somewhere in between.   The mother had a real gift for putting reasonable arguments in unreasonable language.  E.g., the trigger for Lady Bird's jump out of the car was not the reasonable ""Your dreams of an expensive East Coast college are unwise"" but the absurd ""You are probably going to end up in jail.""  She also filled her conversation with unnecessary insults such as ""You walked a little weird across the stage.""  But it is also true, as noted in another thread, that she was not really ""controlling"" and seemed to place no restrictions at all on Lady Bird's freedom of movement.",7doxvl
dq7t3on,"Sure, now I've ranted about this a lot on my twitter, and I'll try to remain calm while I describe my distaste with this film.

To sum up: I generally am just frustrated with nearly every aspect of the film in regards to what it's forced me to see rather than what actually seemed interesting. As well as the sense of being lied to in regards to what the film was going to be.

The Feelings: I am not someone who hates coming of age films. I'm someone who usually loves a dive into a character in a time of great transition and change. Despite these two facts, the general nature of Ladybird made me despise both of the above during my viewing. This is because the character that's at the center of this is frankly infuriating and boring in equal measure. We're following a self centered narcissistic middle class white girl who despite those traits is as bland as tapioca. I have seen this character before, I have seen nearly everyone of the ""plots"" that pervade the film before, and I am frankly just tired of it all. The general nature of this whole film was relatively boring, uninspired, and made me wish some other filmmaker got the chance to use the budget to make something else. So what elements make this so tired you might ask, well I'll tell you.

First off, this film has no idea what the word ""focus"" even is. If I was to count all of the ""plots"" that run through this film I'd arguably come to anywhere between four to six or seven. This film is chock full of storylines that don't really interact with any thing else, none of them really reflect a thematic statement of the film(cause the film lacks one). All of this is made worse because there's no central story in this film. There's no real throughline that makes any sense.  Hell, to call them ""plots"" is entirely overestimating them. They were really just a series of vignettes, bits of watered down plot points or setpieces I've seen time and time before in other movies and done much better. Why, because the entire film is really just a jumbled mess of vignettes no emotional moment in the film really lands or delivers a punch to me. Hell, from what I've talked to from others, every emotional bit they attribute to the film generally is coming from their own personal experiences and memories, cause this film doesn't present anything with enough set up or a skilled enough pay off to make it work. Why, the pay off to all of these is fucked up because they're just vignettes and the bits that ""pay them off"" come far after I've stopped caring about what happened. 

Second, the main character, Ladybird, and her mom(who you can barely call a main character if we're honest), are also just as bland because they're just a cliched tropey sketches of characters I'd seen before. Hell, I saw the mom and daughter of this damn movie back in Freaky Friday, where they were done better. This is because I have no reason to care about Ladybird. She has no real struggle, she suffers no consequences that feel tangible, she doesn't really change, and shows very little sense of an internal world or thought process happening behind her decisions. She just kind of is, and does things. What few traits she have can be summed up as: selfish, narcissistic, and white. While her mom is equally bland. All she is is: passive-aggressive, abusive, sometimes caring, and just white. She exhibits the normal behavior of a ""movie mom"" where she's passive-aggressive and combative, but in this film we don't really see why(you can interpret out a reason, but the evidence for this doesn't show up until middle of the film). She attacks her daughter over things without provocation, she actively shits on her dreams and self worth, and at no point explains herself, apologizes, or really changes(up until the very very end, and even that it's hard to argue is a solid change). I want to understand this character, understand why she communicates the way she does, if there's a reason behind why she criticizes her daughter, or why she seems to throw the economic troubles and frustrations onto her kid. But we don't get that. We don't really get any sense of what's happening inside her mind or her world. So she just comes off feeling flat.

My other problems with the film has to be the sense that I felt lied to. If you remember the opening scene of the film, it opens with Ladybird throwing herself out of a moving car. She threw herself out of a fucking car! That's a powerful opening. That tells me that this world I'm looking at is one of heightened behavior and events, wary I am to say a bit ""twee"", and I was excited to see what kind of character would do this. Yet, with the rest of the entire film nothing else reaches that moment of heightened behavior. Everything else in comparison just feels dull, bland, and without definition. made sharper by how throughout the film I feel less and less like Ladybird is someone who'd just throw themselves out of a car. Which ties back into this feeling that Ladybird is a bad character(as well as a bad person).
    I'm also sad because this film shows me people who I'd totally rather care about. Ladybird's best friend has a life that hints at something interesting, the gay actor has some stuff going on, her dad has an interesting story, her brother has an interesting story, all of these people feel more deserving of a film about them than Ladybird. As a result this film feels like the worst aspects of Hollywood, a film about a bland person who the creator thinks is interesting and deserving of a story because the character or their life echoes aspects of their own life. When in fact, both are just fucking boring.

I even take issue in this film with its ending. Cause it's a bad ending! There are nearly four points that the film could've ended before the bullshit ""gets super drunk and rushed to hospital"" bit. Endings that could've kept us in the emotional place we were in(or rather where the film wanted us to be), but instead it just kept going. So even in the end, the film just dragged and plodded along and couldn't even have a unique ending.

Just, this was a bad film, a film tht made me so so very angry, and I hope beyond hope it wins no awards this year cause it doesn't deserve it. This was a bad debut, a bad film, and I bet that in a year it'll be just forgotten.",7doxvl

It's like when writers have their friends help them punch up a script. ,7doxvl

dqurylw,"The Big Sick is relatable to anyone with pushy parents, or frankly anyone who has experienced a relationship (male or female). But it's especially relatable to people with pushy immigrant parents, even if they're not Pakistani like Kumail's family is. I don't really think that there's any male or female slant since Kumail wrote it with his wife, even though it's from the male perspective it's pretty gender neutral in terms of storytelling. It would be pretty easy to gender swap the roles if they wanted to. 

Not really sure why you're passive-aggressively trying to lump me in as the ""average reddit male"", Lady Bird was clearly written from a female perspective. It's a very narrow slice of life movie about a very specific kind of person growing up in a particular time in American history, and as a period piece (weird to say about a movie set in like 2002 but nevertheless...) it makes specific references to people growing up in that era. It's a movie about what it was like for Greta Gerwig to grow up in a post-9/11 Sacramento Catholic school. Don't get me wrong, it portrays that topic very well, thanks in large part to its performances, I just don't know if what the characters are going through is meant to speak to me personally outside of the more general ""parents just don't understand"" kind of thing.

Like, the scene near the end of The Big Sick where [Kumail is leaving for New York and has a moment with his dad, but his mom won't come out of the car because she's still super mad at him](#spoiler) hit me really hard, man. That was a perfect representation of what it feels like to have immigrant parents and how they react to their kids dropping the traditions they tried bringing over to North America. And while it's a moment between ['Twas the butlerfather and son](#spoiler), I don't think you need to be a [son of a father](#spoiler) to relate to it, because it also reminded me of shit my sister's gone through with my parents too, and [I've been in similar situations like that where the parental roles have been reversed and it's my dad's that's pissed and my mom consoling me](#spoiler). So I really don't think it's a gender thing.

Whereas in Lady Bird, it's very much about a daughter's relationship with her parents. The closest I came to relating to that movie is seeing basically exact conversations I've witnessed my sister have with my parents, and I know for a fact that it's really not the same thing for boys. Greta is unabashed about it being about her experience as a woman, and from a narrative perspective it's one of the film's strengths, because it's uncompromising, and I don't necessarily need to relate to the characters too much to see that, but for me it just takes it down from like the 9/9.5 that it seems to be for a lot of people to like an 8, because it's like I'm looking at it from the other side of a window, peering into this house, and it makes me feel more detached from the story than I probably could have been.

I saw my own mother in her, and I completely felt and understood the underlying love between lady bird and her mom despite all the bickering and mean shit they said

Because that sort of near-death experience can't help but have an effect on a person, *therefore* this causes her to think 'maybe this isn't quite what I wanted', and it brings her to finally call back home and confront the problems that she's been having with her mother, which has been the main conflict of the entire film.

Those 'therefores' are important; it can't just be her in NY *and then out of nowhere* she calls her mom. There has to be a *reason* for it, otherwise it's not all that engaging as a story or relatable as a decision that character would make.

dsgy3d6,"> Comforting her after she lost her virginity... you mean the scene where the female teenager is yelled at for shutting the bathroom door during a shower, then a parent comes into the bathroom with their nearly naked adult child?

I don't recall a scene occurring this way in the film, but I will look for it on my re-watch. I believe that after the mother consoles Lady Bird in the car, they went to real estate open house showings, rather than the scene you are suggesting.

> Do you know why the first scene is like that? why ladybird LITERALLY throws herself from the car? she has no control. this child has no control in what happens in their life, they don't even get to control someone busting into their room. This mother then BLAMES the child for the parent's own actions.

Your belief that she has no control in her life stems from the remainder of the movie, but sequentially, the first scene occurs first chronologically. Your impression of her situation in the events following are clouding the way that you view the first scene.

I also disagree with you that this is the reason she jumps out of the moving car, but there is plenty more for us to discuss beyond this and I worry that I may run out of characters.

> ok, here is something fun. What bad things does lady bird do?

Two and a half examples:

 * Tell her father to drop her off at school a block away so she is not seen with him.

 * Leave her friend ""Julie"" behind to become friends with the popular girl Jenna. Arguably, her intent in becoming friends with Jenna is solely to have an opportunity to become closer to Kyle, and therefore, she can be seen as manipulating Jenna (also a ""bad"" thing).

I don't understand the reason why you are asking this question.

To respond to [your other reply here](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7doxvl/official_discussion_lady_bird_spoilers/dsd7vtk/):

> I present a ""one-sided"" view because we have a grown woman acting shitty and a teenager acting like a teenager/adult.
>
> What do those crumpled letters say? do you remember? ""I got pregnant with you young"". it is an excuse.

If you look closer, you will see that the letters profess how much the mother loves her daughter. The parents adopted Lady Bird's brother Miguel because they believed they were unable to conceive a child naturally. However, when the mother became pregnant with Lady Bird, she writes in the letter that she viewed it as a miracle.

Look at Lady Bird's own reaction to reading those series of crumpled, unfinished letters. She smiles and calls her mother in an attempt to connect with her, asking how the mother felt when she received her driver's licence and drove on the Sacramento streets for the first time.

> and do you remember why the mother didn't actually finish the letters? ""ladybird would criticize my handwriting"". literally not something we saw ladybird do in the entire of the film. it is an excuse.

That may have been the excuse the mother gave to Lady Bird, but people do not always express their true intentions accurately in their own words. The father provides an alternative explanation, stating that the mother couldn't find the right words to truly express how she felt, and would rather not give a completed letter than risk misrepresenting her feelings. Indeed, the content of the letters (see above) seems to suggest the father's explanation is more true to the situation.

>The mother still has not accepted her role in acting like a shitty parent or a shitty human being, and hasn't tried to change that. she has put that burden on ladybird.

We are in agreement that the mother is not always a good parent, but again, you are presenting a one-dimensional view of her. I've provided plenty of examples already why that may not be the case. Here is another: Did you wonder why Miguel's girlfriend seems to live with the family? As she tells Lady Bird, the mother took her in after her own parents threw her out. This shows some level of compassion on the part of the mother, and Miguel's girlfriend tells this to Lady Bird expressly to convey this to her (and by extension, to the viewer).

> ladybird, a girl whose mother hasn't talked to her for months, is 2000 miles away from home, in a completely new place and experience. Her mother, at home, in the same experience but without ladybird. Who has to reach out? ladybird. the child.

Agreed, I believe the mother should have reached out first to her daughter, especially as Lady Bird/Christine is in a completely new location.

> and that driving stuff has more to do with control of the situation. Ladybird hated the place when she didn't have control...but when she was actually given space to find her independence, she found that she liked the place through the rosetinted glasses. It actually shows that the mother, through her lack of understanding of dealing with other human beings(you know, outside of her work as a nurse) pushed her daughter away.

That may have been your interpretation of the ending, and the purpose of Lady Bird's question about driving in Sacramento. However, I (and many other comments in this thread) believe that the message is one of hope, of reconciliation, of understanding the meaning of home. ""Rosetinted glasses"" is often used as a disparaging metaphor, but in this instance, it should not be. Lady Bird/Christine has a new perspective and appreciation for Sacramento, a new belief in Sacramento as not just where she was raised, but as her home town, emphasis on *home*.",7doxvl

dq9qmsq,"Lady Bird is an imperfect person, just like I am, just like we are. Learning a lesson doesn't mean that the same mistake won't be repeated. Minor, temporary victories are incredible accomplishments in life because they are the building blocks to greater successes down the line. They are also surprisingly difficult to earn because of our general tendencies to judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their actions. 

Lady Bird learns from boyfriend #1 that an emotional connection doesn't guarantee a strong relationship. She learns from boyfriend #2 that looks and attitude aren't everything. So why is she ready to hook up with guy #3 who is less interesting and kind than the other two by far? 

Because she's still learning. We all are. 

The first time her mom is barging into Lady Bird's room her father warns/begs- just let this one go, it's not worth it. Mom insists on doing so anyways. 

Mom has a right to do so but Lady Bird isn't wrong in how she feels, either. Oftentimes it can seem impossible for both parties in a conflict to yield a satisfactory result because they're too focused winning a power struggle instead of listening to the other participant. 

And after her mom has picked fights, after she has made hurtful comments, after she has taunted her daughter, look at how her mom reacts when she picks up Lady Bird outside of her boyfriend's house after an unpleasant sexual experience. Mom is in the perfect position to say ""I told you so"" or make a cold observation about how Lady Bird made a poor choice but she sees her daughter's pain and just says ""*Ohh*"" and winces and holds her daughter. But then they're fighting fifteen minutes later in the movie. Why? Because she's still learning. We all are.

I didn't take the character's destiny as the outcome of hard decisions, so much as her trying to make good guesses in the shadow of her youth as defined by the place and relationships it encompasses.

He was allowed to go yo public school, he was allowed to go to a distant school, he was allowed yo exist without constant criticism, he was allowed privacy even while living in the living room. Pretty much the opposite of ladybird.

Does that mean the mother doesn't love him?

Yes, the mother has compassion for everyone but her own biological child. If attention is love, does that mean that not giving attention isn't love?

The mother's actions fall directly into narcissistic behaviors. Nothing ladybird does is right, we never see praise only deridement even at the best of times and things. When ladybird asks her mother about the clean room... in a really adult and intelligent way... the mother's response is ""I was a child of an alcoholic""... cool. how does that answer the question.

dq6itd4,"> 'reflecting' on it from the beginning

'Arguing' is more like it. This is the first point in the entire movie where she even has a chance to actually think about what all this change even means for her.

> would have been a lot clearer if earlier in the film she had refused to party, but then tries to change when she goes to NYC

Let's back up a moment here: so she wants to go to an east coast college for the whole movie. Why? Because she wants to experience, feel, and be something big and revelatory. If the idea of a NY experience is that to her, then why wouldn't it extend to what a NY party is to her? In retrospect, the parties she has back in Sacramento almost feel like warmups to whatever party she's waiting for in NY; its just that once she gets there, she realizes that her idea of a big, epic college party - getting shitfaced as all hell - isn't exactly as it was all cracked up to be, as shown through the hospitalization.

>she already has that long revelation about how she loves Sacramento

Feeling an emotion and being able to put it into words are two very, *VERY* different things. Sometimes, it can take years to get from one to the other, especially if the emotion is traumatic. It is not a stretch to say that she feels the moment before she leaves, but isn't able to put it into words until after the hospital experience.

> I didn't see this expressed by this episode at all

I'm referring to everything that happens after she wakes up from it. She sees the kid without the eye and realizes that they're in kinda the same place at that moment, she goes to the church specifically because it's a reminder of the home that used to annoy her so much and that she's only starting to appreciate, and she calls her mom because she wants to patch the rift between her and her mom rather than just let it sit there. If those actions don't express some kind of doubt, then I don't know what does.

> Why couldn't she just wake up in a pool of her own vomit after blacking out like most people?

O_O

You and I have a very different definition of 'most people'.

Although seriously, the more I'm thinking about it now.... *was* that a near-death experience? I mean, I know I said earlier that it might've been that, but are we just both assuming that because she got hospitalized?

Just wanted to address this really quickly because I don't fully agree with the person you're responding to. But I don't think her longing for the East Coast is built out of any sense of reflection or even higher level of thinking. Her reasons for wanting to leave are immature. She has this ideal of New York that she kind of realizes doesn't even really exist which is why she reaches for a little slice of home and familiarity when she goes to the chapel.

And to be clear, I don't read that she regrets her decision or that New York wasn't what she wanted. But after going to the chapel; it kind of just dawns on her that even after going across the country, she's still going to carry Sacramento with her.",7doxvl
dq7ytk3,"> She's been 'reflecting' on it from the beginning, that's why she makes such an effort to go to college on the east coast  
  

You could easily infer the reason she's been wanting to go to the East Coast all along wasn't because of self-reflection but to get the heck away from home and be as far away as possible. I think many teens go through a phase where they want to be as far away as possible to feel independent and not have to deal with taking orders from parents.  

> This would have been a lot clearer if earlier in the film she had refused to party, but then tries to change when she goes to NYC. As it is I just don't think its clear  
  

Again, it's moreso of an ""I'm in a new place where I don't know anyone, any hangout spots, etc. It was less her partying, and her just trying to do anything to fit in. You can clearly see how awkward she is with the guy she's talking to at the party. She then starts drinking just to try and ease the anxiety (which was evident from her saying San Francisco the second time instead of repeating Sacramento).  

> Before she leaves she already has that long revelation about how she loves Sacramento (talking about driving through it for the first time). The last 15 minutes of the film are not really the time for two big and conflicting revelations   
  

I'm not getting you here. She didn't reveal how much she loves/missed Sacramento until the final phone call.  
  

> I didn't see this dramatized in this episode at all  
  
It was clear as day. It was a combination of her growing up and realizing her mistakes, and her really being homesick. Going to the Church made her feel like being home again. I could see regret in her wanting so desperately to move away so quickly, and at the same tone I could see her coming to terms with it and try to make some attempt to feel comfortable in her new home. This is what I asked for. And now that I've gotten it I'm scared. I need Mom more than ever to help steer the ship (which we had seen throughout the movie. The mother was the main one being strong for the rest of hte family and helping them get through the rough patch). She isn't just apologizing to her mom, she's opening the door to seek guidance on how to fix the hole she's in. She realizes how strong her mom has been for her and the entire family, and it's her finally acknowledging it. Most kids/teens will never admit they're wrong to their parents because they don't want to hear the I Told You So talk. And her making that call wasn't just about her admitting she was wrong, it was about her maturing.
  

> Almost dying is complete overkill. Why couldn't she just wake up in a pool of her own vomit after blacking out like most people? ;)  
  

Almost dying was a complete exaggeration. She was rushed to the hospital because the boy panicked and called an ambulance. The tone in the ER nurse's voice ""She's just drunk"" was thrown in as light humor that we'd been getting all movie. Just showing how teens can panic and overexaggerate things, just as Lady Bird was doing throughout the movie. ",7doxvl

dq5db8w,"> This was the heart of the film, but there were too many other plotlines that led nowhere, so you weren't really sure what the structure was or when the film was going to reach a conclusion. I think it would have worked better as a netflix series, where they could focus on all the different characters. Either that, or cut most of it and focus on the mother/daughter story.

I think that's by design and to the films benefit. These are characters that are existing and you don't get a clean bow wrapped for every plotline. That's what I love about this movie. The characters and relationships feel lived in. And by the end, we get a glimpse of what certain relationships are going to be like going forward. Lady Bird leaving home is an important part of her story but it isn't the end of her story. 

> Saorsie stays exactly the same, showing that she was perfect from the beginning. It wasn't terrible, just a little amateurish.

I don't agree with this. She does change. A lot of that is dealt with when she abandons her best friend and redeems herself. She's complicated and honestly has a bit of a narcissistic streak.  But at the same time, you're right. The mom *is* mean. I think it shows a lot to have a mother be downright awful but still have that love there because that's how a lot of relationships work. 

I mean, I think we'll just agree to disagree. But I can't think of anything amateurish about Gerwig's direction. She's an actor, so obviously she's able to get great performances out of her cast. But she's also a solid visual storyteller as well. The film is bookended by two great montages that tell you all you need to know about where those characters are at, mentally. And she subverts expected tropes in her coming of age story in an interesting and charming way. She lets a mother figure be ""warm and scary"". She gives the ""mean, cool kids"" more depth and they weren't just awful people. She lets Lady Bird be the one that initiates the sexual encounter as opposed to being pressured into it by the more experienced male character. There's plenty of things that she does that are bold and not indicative of an amateur at all.  ",7doxvl

There were much dumber ones that were just as nonsensical as Ladybird that people *gave to themselves*. I get exactly what you’re saying and I’m saying the other thing happens too.

Boogie is also just an example, because earlier you said nicknames are names that “aren’t big leaps from their real names”. Not everyone calls her Ladybird every time either as far as I remember, and they don’t all just go along with it. I don’t think the nun did every time. Her mom calls her Christine occasionally which prompts annoyance. Even the first theater teacher gives her a weird look. People going along with it just means she’s persistent in insisting on it.

You really just seem to have a problem with either the name specifically (which, who cares?

why was the mother acting that way about her daughter but not about her husband, or even her son?

her son, that didn't have a job, didn't dress in an appropriate way, was under her roof?

the mother asks the father if the son and his girlfriend have sex on the pullout.  The mother doesn't knock, walks right in to a teenager's bedroom, right in on her in the bathroom... but hasn't walked into her living room while her son is there? That is a boundary issue.

I think the mother falls on the narcissist range. The nun shows actual maternal actions/feelings towards ladybird/Christine. 

now, contast how they react with her, and how she reacts to them. The nun understands the situation, sees the humor in it, and actually lays out reality, without screaming, with out threats, without blame. Ladybird/Christine actually listens.  

The mother forces the daughter to go to a religious school because of fear of the real world and then yells at her for the price of the school. That is more than just a bit shitty. if anyone said, ""hey, I want to take you to an amazing band and i'll pay the ticket"".... and then during the show you find that you don't like the band so much, if your friend should scream at you, ""why don't you appreciate this, I spend so much money"". they'd be a dick. How does ladybird react, like a normal teenager. ""ok, you want to keep bringing up how much this costs... fine, tell me how much it costs... come on, you keep asking me if I know how much, you tell me... then, after I get out of here, I'll pay you back and never have to see you again"".

So, the mother showed her daughter that the mother hates her.  
Why? why does the mother do that?

Because ladybird didn't do what the mother wanted, with no discussion, no understanding of being a teenager, no care about the wants or needs of ladybird.

sure, it is completely fine when a mother says that her children are worthless, not even worth money to go to community college, right? it is completely fine to belittle your child for doing something you have forced them to do! If you had this mother as a boss, you would have choice words for them. 

no where did I say she was a ""horrible person"". I think I used the word abusive. if a person is abusive to someone in their life, it doesn't mean they are abusive to everyone in their lives. Parental abusers are pretty damned good at hiding it to all but the abused.

For example, the mother not sending a letter. You believe this shows lack of carrying, but rather, it is the opposite. The father collects those crumpled letters and gives them all to Lady Bird, because he understands that the mother's inability to write a letter to Lady Bird is actually because she cares so much that she cannot find the right words to express her caring. And the father wants Lady Bird to understand how her mother truly loves her, despite their often severely flawed relationship (such as the mother refusing to go inside with her daughter to the airport departure gate). And this attempt to heal their rift is what opens Lady Bird's eyes to her mother's actual love, and causes Lady Bird to leave a voice message for her mother, sharing a beautifully intimate moment of driving on the Sacramento roads.",7doxvl

I live in Norcal but was raised in Socal and argue with people all the time that it originated in SoCal. Snoop was saying that shit on The Chronic album back in 92, Brotherhood Creed(rap group from L.A.) used to say that on their songs. Hell if you want to go back even further Dolemite was saying that shit back in the 70s.

It *definitely* started in SoCal.",7doxvl
drkkaeq,"I don't think I am adding in more malice or villainous intention than what is there.

Ladybird/Christine wasn't the one that cut ties. She didn't want to be overly sheltered and tried to take control of her life on her own. The mother did not want ladybird/Christine to do that. That is why the father had to sneak the student loan paperwork.

If the father did not sneak that paperwork, the mother would have screwed her daughter's chances at college, forcing the daughter to do what the mother wanted. 

when the daughter showed initiative to start to take control of her own live, you know, like teenagers should... the mother cut ties.

The mother chose to ignore and abandon her own child because the child applied for a college and got accepted to a college.
",7doxvl
dsd7vtk,"I present a ""one-sided"" view because we have a grown woman acting shitty and a teenager acting like a teenager/adult.

What do those crumpled letters say? do you remember? ""I got pregnant with you young"". it is an excuse. 

and do you remember why the mother didn't actually finish the letters? ""ladybird would criticize my handwriting"". literally not something we saw ladybird do in the entire of the film. it is an excuse.

The mother still has not accepted her role in acting like a shitty parent or a shitty human being, and hasn't tried to change that. she has put that burden on ladybird.

ladybird, a girl whose mother hasn't talked to her for months, is 2000 miles away from home, in a completely new place and experience. Her mother, at home, in the same experience but without ladybird. Who has to reach out? ladybird. the child. 

and that driving stuff has more to do with control of the situation.  Ladybird hated the place when she didn't have control...but when she was actually given space to find her independence, she found that she liked the place through the rosetinted glasses. It actually shows that the mother, through her lack of understanding of dealing with other human beings(you know, outside of her work as a nurse) pushed her daughter away.

It's harder for both the parents and Christine because it's left ambiguous as to the financial aid package she got. 


Her mother did close communication but we saw the effects that had on her as well. It's not fair that Christine had to be the one to fix things but it's what she wanted. The movie ends with her understanding that her mother does care but that she still needed to take her own path. It's one of those things you gain perspective on when someone moves out.

dr0woa5,"I'm not sure how I feel about using a wikipedia page to prove your point on west coast slang, especially since the earliest reference(except for Prince) is from a UCSB professor who went to *urban* schools in the Bay area to gather research, and that was in 93 anyway *after* the rappers I listed came out with their songs.


I went to school during the height of LA area hip hop in the late 80s, early 90s and we were using hella, as you can see in songs by the artist I listed, it was used by LA rappers a lot. Brotherhood Creed had a song call Hellava Girl back in 91.

I think I know why Northern California people are so adamant that it started up here and they claimed as their own. In the early/mid 00s when the South was ruling hip hop, the Bay Area started a movement that gained national traction and a large part of that was using, and *overusing* slang as an identifier, since a large part of what made southern hip hop so popular is the southern slang they incorporated into their songs, this made songs popular on the national level because people loved hearing new slang. Hella was one of those words that they used and overused to the point where your  schoolmates in SoCal were young enough to think that it was a NorCal thing. 


It's actually to the point now where NorCal hip hop has become a caricature of itself because everybody wants to be an E-40 and make up slang.


Anyway long story short NorCal hip hop got back on the national radar by overusing slang, so now every slang term that comes from CA people will now always claim it came from the North.",7doxvl
drl6nmu,"The mother didn't fill out the financial aid package. the mother chose not to. once again, the father had to sneak it.

As an individual that went to college at the same time as Christine/ladybird, the college I went to was not that different in costs from NYU. loans did pay for a great deal of college. 

The mother lost the ability to help guide her daughter by not allowing growth and understanding.. .and by shutting down.

The conversations should have been held about cost, other issues but those weren't every the focus of the conversations... I wouldn't even call them conversations.  The getting the credits at a community college and then transferring. The mother chose to make it her way or the highway, and then cried when the daughter chose the highway.

ill-intent or not, the mother made choices that were not in her daughter's best interest. The mother made choices to invade her child's privacy, even in the most private of moments in the bathroom. 

or at the very beginning of the film, ""I want to go to an east coast college""... ""you aren't even worth the money to go to community college"". Berating, insulting, not accurate, and then the mother spends the entire film trying to push ladybird/Christine to a community college.

If you think that is me adding malice, then I guess, it is malice but we have to be understanding of the decisions made.

Yes, WE get to see the mother working on letters but in the end, she doesn't send those letters. She doesn't talk to her daughter. Those are choices. If you are saying those actions are abusive, which you have in previous comments. A person is choosing  to be abusive.  and it isn't that the daughter accepted but had JUST applied and was waitlisted.

If you saw a person in a relationship like this, would you be concerned?  
How about if, instead of a mother, it was a father? too self-involved to understand the feelings of their child, constantly berating them, not helping with even filling out college papers, barging into the child on the bathroom, and him getting so upset about his child applying for college behind his back that he emotionally cuts her off.

So acknowledge that but won't acknowledge that Lady Bird changed as well? Maybe not drastically but it's clear that she's going to continue making mistakes but she still has growth.

I mean, based on your replies, it just seems like you have an issue with the film being played pretty straight from a filmmaking sense and how that doesn't really mesh with the screenplay.

> I'm not sure if you've taken any if you don't at least know what I'm referring to about character arcs.

I do and Lady Bird *does* have an arc. It isn't a drastic shift in attitude or personality. It's a simple love of home and thankfulness for her mom that she didn't display for the entire film. That's not a small thing. ",7doxvl

drl7w4h,"Again, I see your point but I don't think it's as simple as you make it out to be. Shitty parenting and selfish actions but her mom does care in her own shitty way. It's her moms inability to move past her perceptions as the caregiver and gets stuck in her idea that Christine's decisions will ruin Christine's life. Parents do that stuff without having a big fight but it's a common thing for many families. Struggling with their kids trying to find their own way when it's risky as hell. Like when I kid wants to pursue their dream in the arts or become a mechanic/plumber/pyramid scheme member.

I'm probably the only person that disputes it because I was born and raised in L.A. but I live in Sacramento now, and most people that reference hella, use late 90s and early 00 sources as proof, when I know in L.A. we had been using that since the age of Dolemite.

drl8mw1,"I never said it was simple, as you said, life very rarely is simple.

It is a common thing for a parent to completely stop communicating or helping their child simply because the child applied for a school?

Remember, she wasn't even accepted yet. 

Ok, how does that silent treatment and emotional withdraw fall in line with the mother caring?

Yes, I lack a bit of empathy for the mother. Here is my reason. The mother is not unable to show care and compassion. She does so very easily at work, she does very easily for her adopted son but for her daughter, it is not there. We do not see the mother act this way to any other person in the entire film. infact, she goes well out of her way to show the opposite of who she is around ladybird.

The brother is ""wasting"" the college education from a large university but there are no fights or tension there.  The mother isn't nitpicking everything he does.

and, I think this would be a much different movie and be reviewed much differently if marion's role was changed to a father. ",7doxvl

I actually had to deal with a similar issue with my own mother 6 years ago where we got into a fight as I tried to make my own decisions and she shut down for a while. 


It's rarely worth it to keep that crap going forever unless it's on a different scale of abuse. You're not going to see it my way by seeing that the mother is a flawed human trying to care for her daughter in her own way. It's not good and full of the mother's past issues with her mother but she honestly does love her daughter. There are many layers of issues that the mother has and it's clearly making her a bad parent but she does love her daughter and wants to guide her in life towards the path she thinks will be ""best"".


I think it's more like the song in Father and Son by Cat Stevens but more angry.

drl9kol,"I do not think she is a villain. 

Abuse isn't always villainous. it isn't always, ""wire hangers"".

abuse is just cruel treatment of a person repeatly. I think we both agree that what the mother does would fall into cruel treatment.

look. I see a drug user and I don't think they are villains but they worry about something else rather than the actual important things. Yes, the mother isn't raping or whatever but she has miss raised her child... and has chosen to do so after not doing the same thing to the other child.

There is a difference between a grudge and just not chosing to deal with it. like a druggie... Shit gets real, and sometimes, it isn't a grudge to walk away for your own safety or sanity.

but really, ""oh mom, that is how you show me your love, by telling me that I am worthless"" isn't really a healthy relationship.

drlbg1m,"I guess we agree more than I understood. I think the mother holds Christine in a higher regard because she's the ""miracle child"" and as cruel as it is to say, Miguel is the adopted child. It's one of those old world attitudes where a parent/teacher rides the favorite child/student the hardest.


For her own sake, Christine definitely needed to leave the nest for herself but it will also help her mom gain perspective. A lot of the time, people can't change if they're too close to the problem. I think that's the main thing that will let the mother see how unreasonable she's really being and stop deluding herself. People need space sometimes, whether that space is temporary or permanent is up to the people involved. However, not everyone is going to be happy becoming estranged to their parents for years. Many times, people who get that space and perspective realize that love for their parent outweighs the idea of punishing their parent.


If it were truly cut and dry for Christine to cut her mother out, I would agree but I think they both recognize that they love each other and don't want the other gone. The ending of the movie signifies that Christine is on her own path now but doesn't want to lose sight of her past and her mother. She doesn't want to be there now but it's obvious that she'll come back to Sacramento and her mother rather than turning away from that part of her life. ",7doxvl

drm8ojn,"You are expecting the mother to gain perspective. People don't change to often or too easily.

you are thinking about it wrong, it isn't about ""punishing"" the parent. If you have a friend that constantly shits on you, if you stop hanging out with them it isn't to punish them. It is to gain sanity and man, it is hard to maintain a relationship on any level with someone trying to take control away from you.

I took the ending differently. She was finally on her own, she was scared of making decisions for herself. I mean she was thrown into a big crazy world with little parental help. She power-drank to try to make herself feel better or in control or to allow her to escape the internal controls. she realizes that it is hard to control yourself and misses having someone make those decisions for you.

It is almost a rumspringa story.  go, and be scared and alone and don't worry, we'll be here to accept you back in.

It is on the mother as to what happens now, as it should have been. That is why I don't think that Christine/ladybird should have called. She has been the one to try to keep communication open the whole movie, she has been the one to try to actually talk logic and sense and understand the emotions of the other. The mother/parent has not, she shut down communication, yelled and screamed and raged. 

 given her track record however, it will be lack of communication and more belittling.",7doxvl
