gjf549p,"I went into this movie expecting nothing and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Great acting, cool cast, and they made a very difficult topic understandable. 

Questions: 

At the end of movie when Vanessa Kirby is with the little girl do you think this was a fantasy or did she actually have another daughter with someone else in the future? 

Do you think the midwife was at fault for the baby's death? Not that she intended to or that she was a bad person, but should she have called the ambulance sooner or better explained what was going on to the parents? 

Do you think Shia's behavior after his daughter's death was more because of grief, his relapse, or was he just pretending to be a sweet partner in the beginning? I can't get over him just leaving and going to Seattle. It seems like it was more than simply depression.",ky931c
gjlp1bv,"First act was very impactful, but it kind of fell apart from there:

-Is the cousin a prosecutor or a private sector attorney? She has an office like she runs a firm, but then they say it's a criminal trial.

-The attorney's dialogue about the case is poorly written. ""It's an open & shut case"", etc. It just doesn't seem like they took that part seriously.

-You could have a whole separate movie about the ethical dilemma of filing charges against, or suing your midwife. Here it seems like an afterthought, i.e. the movie needed a climax. Why couldn't this story just be about the marriage turning to shit?

-They never really conveyed the malfeasance of the midwife! What did she do wrong?

-That marital rape scene was very unsettling, but in any other movie, it'd carry a lot more weight. I mean, that was seriously disturbing, but in the wake, it seems like ""boy, their marriage sure is falling apart.""

-Did Shia LaBeouf have a merkin?!?",ky931c
gjesz5p,"Movie itself was kind of unspectacular beyond the first act sequence, but Vanessa Kirby is great. The internalization of her character's grief remind me a lot of Manchester by the Sea.",ky931c
gjev1lm,"I really hope Ellen Burstyn gets nominated because she was wonderful in this.

The whole apple metaphor was some film student bullshit though lmao.",ky931c
gjez3y5,It’s rare for a film to feature a Safdie brother and not have him involved in the tensest scene,ky931c
gjf0izz,"Vanessa Kirby is spectacular at conveying her inner pain, guilt, and conflictions.

I thought Pieces of a Woman was captivating throughout and I'm honestly surprised people are saying it fizzles out after the initial 30 minute one take. You are with her and her suffering the entire time as well as how this awful tragedy has affected the lives of everyone they know.

I just wasn't crazy about the apple tree obscured final shot.",ky931c
gjupxwj,"I’m still trying to process the movie (just watched it last night). One thought that does come to mind, and maybe is an unpopular opinion after having read most of the comments, is my feeling towards Shia’s character. Although I don’t agree with his aggressive/sexual behavior, I can understand his feelings. Martha became completely cold and in her own way of dealing with grief shut out her husband. They didn’t have conversations together, make decisions about the child together, she didn’t even actually care when she knew he had an affair. It’s disappointing he took the money and left but in response to some people’s question on here “did he ever care?”. I think he cared a lot.",ky931c
gjni645,"I know everyone loves the first 30 minutes, and I do too, but I also love how the rest of the movie has me constantly trying to remember what happened in the first 30 minutes. We have the luxury of being able to review the text, but in real life and for the characters this is impossible. 

I love Shia and Kirbys performances even if the plot was slightly Ho-hum. 

I would also be interested to hear or read any birthworkers impressions of the midwife in the beginning. As someone who has been trained as a doula, but never attended a birth or pursued it professionally, I did think it was weird how little she communicated with Martha about the baby’s heart rate, etc. I know she was a “back-up” but in my opinion that would make me more eager to communicate and transfer to hospital. I wish her character had more screen time.",ky931c
gjuhk1i,"Questions about Sean.

1. Why did he throw the hat in the car when he was leaving to Seattle?

2. Why was he so quick to take the $ and leave Martha during a terrible time in their lives. It doesn't even seem like there was even a conversation involved between Sean and Martha before he left.  

3. He seemed relatively nice and caring in the beginning, then became cold and emotionless at the end. Did he ever care?

Thats all for now. 

Thanks in advance for the responses.",ky931c
gjfd4hh,Honestly this movie isn’t that bad. Yeah it gets melodramatic but it still kept my attention. I really can’t wait to see Kirby in the world to come,ky931c
gjw2zar,"Man, that was a heavy movie. Really turned on the waterworks at moments. Especially the beginning, I went in reading or watching nothing about. I was so stressed the baby wasn't gonna make it, when she came out alive I already got teary eyed. And then... 

Both Shia and Vanessa Kirby were spectacular. It did get a little dull at the middle. The movie was also quite confrontational, I really felt bad for the nurse as well. I get they were just hurt, but everyone was treating her like a murderer. Also the mom really got on my nerves sometimes, let people work out their problems in their own way. Felt like she was pushing her too hard to cope the way she wanted her to cope.",ky931c
gjoq9yi,"Spoilers

>!The only problem I had with this movie was the relationship between Martha and Sean. It didn't seem like Sean was helping Martha at all with her grief. And the fact that the mother pays for Sean to leave and takes the money just like that shows he's a low character. He could at least have a heart and stay for his wife while she grieves. The plot was kind of misleading acting like the movie would be about their relationship after this tragedy when it was more about Martha. And I'm honestly glad the midwife didn't get in trouble at the end since I did blame more Martha. It was true that Sean told her she should go to a hospital and she said no. Maybe the baby would have had a better chance of living if she was born in the hospital in case an emergency happened.!<",ky931c
gjg7y5o,"I was expecting more after hearing about it, but I did enjoy the film. Especially Vanessa Kirby's performance. The opening sequence was amazing and then the rest of the film didn't sustain the tone or quality we expected after the first act.

By the way - if my snobby, rich mother told me that if I had followed her advice my baby wouldn't have died I never would have spoken to that b\*\*\*\* again.",ky931c
gjlvuyd,"Kirby killed it. Burstyn had excellent moments that might carry her to a supporting nom.

Sucks that Shia's personal assholery came out, the guy again comes through with a good performance

Interesting Cast- A Safdie, Iliza Shlesinger, and Shiv from Succession (no booty shots, sad face lol), all did well with their roles.

Funny nitpick- Shias character is clearly poor and not as educated as Kirby or her family, yet he did marry a high level corporate executive, and had an affair with her very well off lawyer cousin. BDE triumphs all lol",ky931c
gjrsmjn,"the use of sigur ros during the birth scene just wasn't fair, i knew i was gonna cry but fuck.

echoing everyone else - vanessa kirby carried this movie on her back. learning after the fact that its based on a play makes a whole lot more sense. i feel like only kirby's character and the mother are the only ones that matter, no one else needed to exist",ky931c
gjhpn94,"I find the reaction to Shia very interesting because I am positive that, if not for the likelihood (though I'd be happy to be proven wrong) that he beats women. Because, divorcing yourself from that...his performance is amazing and would definitely be getting a shit ton of hype. But now, people won't even acknowledge it.",ky931c
goq71f1,"1. Vanessa Kirby's portrayal of an extremely difficult delivery is all the more impressive when you consider, as far as I can tell, she has never been pregnant herself.

2. The whole legal plot annoyed the hell out of me because of how inaccurate and unrealistic it was.

- Someone dying of a medical emergency does not automatically mean criminal charges are filed against the person whose care they were under. DAs do not like bringing cases they aren't likely to win and getting a murder/manslaughter conviction against a doctor/nurse/etc is virtually impossible unless you can prove they were incredibly reckless.

- If such a case were going forward, it would be handled by the district attorney where they live. You can't retain a private attorney to file a criminal case (as the family seemed to be doing with the cousin) because private citizens/attorneys don't file criminal cases. 

- Martha and Sean basically had no involvement in the case whatsoever. If there was a criminal case against their midwife, they would be meeting with prosecutors, they'd be having their depositions taken, they'd be asked to testify at the trial. The movie made it seem like neither of them actually participated in any way (other than Sean's hookup with the lawyer).",ky931c
gjujbnt,"This is very minor point but as 29 year old still childless woman I am pleased the description calls 32 year old Vanessa Kirby as “young mother” although I am pretty sure she would not be in medical terms. 

Anyway, it took me a couple of days for me to watch the film so I don’t know if people will red this comment. But in any case, I think the opening was very strong with the one take birth. Most of the film spend its time with cliched reactions to death or a child. And it seemed odd the way the film was titled that it was the man who had most of the meat of the story, even if the woman was treated as idealized (by the film, your mileage might vary on her character). I feel it would have been a better choice to limit the point of view to her or if both were used to tell the story then have both on equal footing or focus on them going through this together. The characters aren’t much beyond man and woman either, but the story seems like a collection of several strories of what happens after a tragedy put together and made visual. The ending is easy to see coming even though it ought to have been the strongest point in the film. The film is still worth a watch, but mainly Kirby’s performance is the drawing point unless you are very passionate about the subject at hand",ky931c
gk578rp,"This movie was pretty heavy at times. 

Agree with everyone that after the home birth, the movie slowly loses steam as it heads towards its ending. Individually, I liked most of the scenes on its own but there were threads that didn’t really lead anywhere by the end.

Question though: Sean and the mother were pursuing the court case together but why does she suddenly decide to pay him off to leave before the trial? He suffers through grief, loses sobriety, cheats on his spouse and spirals but then he just gets paid off and ultimately proves the mother right with her suspicions about his character (which she’d had against him pre-trauma). Was she just taking advantage of the situation to finally get him out of the picture or something?",ky931c
gkpcv4i,"A couple questions:

Did anyone catch how much the cheque was for?

Was Martha’s mother in the early stages of dementia? 

Was the apple tree at the end meant to be one she planted? Because it looked way too old.",ky931c
gjh63ne,"After the first 30 minutes, it’s never as great. 

And it’s one scene too long. Should’ve ended n be bridge, not that fairytale-like apple tree scene.",ky931c
gjgnkb8,"After all the buzz this has gotten, I was disappointed - it wasn't as good as I was expecting. I feel like there's a better version of this film in here. Like the bones are all good - the actors are great, you have this very traumatic and realistic event happening that exposes the cracks in all of these relationships but the problem is that the movie doesn't do enough with all of it, to be honest. I just left with so many questions. Why were Martha and Sean together to begin with? Why did Martha's cousin hook up with Sean? Why did Martha want to donate the body to science? 

I wish the film had allowed us some more insight into Martha's thoughts. I didn't need a big breakdown scene but I wanted to understand more of what she was thinking at different moments. That being said, I really loved the courtroom scene, the birth sequence was also great and I do think that Kirby was fantastic. While Ellen Burstyn was also good, I found her major monologue hard to believe and it felt like it came out of nowhere. I wish the sister had had more to do. 

I really liked the second to last scene with the ashes but really didn't like the final scene with the daughter. I know they wanted to leave it on a positive note but not every couple who loses a child ends up having another one. For some people, it just never happens and I felt like ending it on that note could alienate the people who have been in that place and who weren't able to have another child who survived. Besides, the bridge scene was positive enough - she had found some sort of peace and started to move on. That is very encouraging.",ky931c
gkayqms,Underwhelming movie outside of the opening act. Idk this is an Oscar picture but doesn’t really doesn’t live up to that opening 15 minutes. 6/10,ky931c

gjey6x0,"It wasn't anything noteworthy besides Vanessa Kirby's performance (definitely a lock for multiple award nominations), but I did like what it was trying to accomplish. It felt like this film was more trying to show the void left in her life following the loss of her child rather than just focus on her emotions following it. In fact, I don't think Kirby's character ever had any major breakdown scenes like we usually come to expect with these kind of movies. It was never overly emotional and there wasn't really a dramatic conclusion where she realized she would be alright. Instead, she just moves on. It's hard to make a compelling movie when the main character slouches around for most of it, but I do think it was very realistic which was refreshing to see.",ky931c

gjha70i,"I loved this, but it’s definitely not for everyone. My main anecdote I wanna share though is I spent the entire runtime mixing up Ellen Burstyn, who I’ve seen in so many things but just forgot, for the actress who played Jack Donaghy‘s mother on 30 Rock.

gn98u1w,"Big Vanessa Kirby fan here, but I found this disappointing.   Sure it had terrific performances  but it seemed like two separate movies thrown into a Cuisinart. We have the family dealing with the aftermath of the tragedy which is one movie, and the other movie is the legal case.  Maybe I missed something, but the legal aspect was very confusing.  I got the impression the cousin was a civil attorney in private practice, but then she was prosecuting a criminal case.  But then Kirby's character in her speech made references to financial settlements which would not be part of a criminal trial.  It's as if the filmmakers were using a legal system from another country.  And the first time it was shown that the midwife was in some kind of legal trouble it was when Sean was on his computer.  Why not cut out one of the endless scenes of Martha walking down the street and insert a scene showing Martha and Sean being told that there was going to be criminal charges filed against the midwife?",ky931c
guwlwvx,"My few cents on the film and the characters:

The movie overall was repetitive in its theme but well executed. Good, sparing use of metaphors. Provided a fascinating insight in childbirth but that would be laudable quality if it were a youtube video. The characters turning cold after a child dies has been shown before - Manchester By The Sea has perfected the portrayal of this theme in more surreal and heartbreaking way and every other film will be compared to it in standards.

I cannot comment on the authenticity on both of their grieves, after all I am not a parent, but they handled it poorly. Martha, you're the mother and your grief is definitely a lot but the other man too is struggling with it. In a way Martha abandoned everyone afflicted by the tragedy, much worse the bereaved father, and shut herself down in an annoying way that hurt others  - giving away the deceased baby, erasing the room and removing pictures.

Sean seemed the perfect 'partner' in the beginning but turned to shit as the film progressed. Cheating in the midst of grief raises questions about how much he really cared. He didn't support Martha enough to call her treatment of him cruel.

In the end, Martha may have had another child with someone else.

My question: did she dispose ashes on the completed bridge?",ky931c

gjpff86,I think this movie was a really interesting psychological case study of dealing with emotional trauma and grief. Vanessa Kirby was amazing and the ending was really beautiful and cathartic.,ky931c
gksmwwt,The opening scene was extremely upsetting to me as a mother of young kiddos. I actually had to fast forward a bit because my heart was beating so fast and I needed to take some dee breaths. The acting was on point.,ky931c
gjf2o61,"this is a really bad movie after the first 30 minutes. shia LaBeouf's character gets more to do than vanessa kirby's and that courtroom scene was such horseshit. like.im pretty sure aaron Sorkin would.have called it over the top. no judge would have ever allowed that to fly. 

vanessa kirby just like kind of exists through this and yeah I get grief is complicated but she literally doesnt do anything for most of the movie.",ky931c
gjersmy,"After the incredible prologue, the film fizzles out and feels like an actor's demo reel.",ky931c
gjf782h,"I thought the acting was really good, but I just didn’t like the movie. It felt like it wasn’t really trying to tell me a story, but was just trying to make me sad, if that makes sense. It just felt flat.",ky931c
gjpi61e,"I’m curious what you all make of the ending. Is that child in the trees a vision of the daughter Martha lost? Or her real child that she eventually has in the future? I’m inclined to believe it’s the latter, since the shot of the seeds growing was right before this final scene. I think it implied that she would give birth again.",ky931c
gk186uc,"Vanessa Kirby and Ellen Burstyn were everything in this movie. Ultimately the whole package was a little disappointing because there is so much extra that isn't handled great.

 I agree with the general sentiment that the metaphor was handled a bit sloppily and that Labeouf's role was too basic and didn't really add much. I like the idea of including his point of view, but it just wasn't done in a particularly meaningful way. I think the Ebert review put it well, that you come away wondering how they ever got together in the first place. Disappearance of Elenor Rigby does a 10x better job showing the grieving father's perspective.

The movie throws a lot of distractions at you and a lot of it doesn't fully land. But again, the parts that showcase Kirby absolutely do.

I also loved the cinematography and the music. That opening scene is just incredible.",ky931c

gkwpfj7,"Perhaps it is too late to make my thoughts known on this movie. But here it is anyways.  


I hated this movie. Specifically, Vanessa Kirby's character made me absolutely dislike this movie.  


**Shia LaBeouf:**   
His role in the movie was just amazing. The controversy sorrounding his personal life have clouded the greatness of his performance.  LaBeouf had his name removed from Netflix’s ‘For your awards consideration’ page promoting the film.   
I loved the opening sequence and the birth scene. The acting was really good. From the start, Shia LaBeouf ate up the role. This working man trying to help his wife's decision to have a natural birth at home. Everytime he spoke, every  interaction he had with the nurse and his wife. He was captivating. When he cries! ""Why are you trying to disappear my kid?"" That got me.

&#x200B;

**Ellen Burstyn:**  
[The scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72E-6LbQABE) she argues with the daughter in the dining room. That is an award worthy performance.

**Vanessa Kirby:**  
Was boring. This is not her fault. the role was written that way. You cannot build a movie to end in an unrealistic court confrontation between Vanessa Kirby and Ellen Burstyn. It's unreal. And that's why I hate this movie. 

&#x200B;

**The ending**: Was not special. It just felt like a kid's fantasy at this point.   


Alright - truth off my chest. Don't yell at me. Lol.",ky931c
gjfoyu8,"This was a good movie for the first 30 minutes. Then they started talking. It was pretty much cliche boilerplate oscar bait after that. Its also pretty disgusting that shia literally does what he is accused of in this. These movies are a dime a dozen and always get overpraised year after year. Remember when I called that out in my hillbilly elegy review? well here we are!

EDIT: oh yeah the courtroom scene is laughably bad",ky931c
gk59r15,"The movie never lives up to its solid (but not flawless) first act, but the performances somehow remain powerful (Kirby’s in particular, but LaBeouf and Burstyn are also at the top of their game).",ky931c
gl9utmf,"I really liked how this movie was shot and the acting was phenomenal. Vanessa Kirby was completely off my radar prior to this but now I'm definitely going to follow her work cuz damn she stole every scene. The plot itself was kind of 'meh' for me because I just can't get over the stupidity of trying to do a home birth. I know they intended it to be kind of ambiguous as to who is at fault, but for me it's very clearly Martha's fault for choosing to have a home birth on principle rather than going to a hospital. In my eyes it may as well have been a movie about a family that decided not to buckle their child's seatbelt on principle and then the kid dies in a car accident that they would have survived otherwise. I just can't not hold the parents accountable because what they did was so catastrophically and obviously stupid.",ky931c

gp8h2pd,"Near the end Ellen and Vanessa are having a conversation and Ellen talks about how her father ‘left for the ghetto’,...she was in an abandoned building hidden under floorboards ....etc. This tread was never fully realized..was she a Holocaust survivor?  Why was this left ‘open’.",ky931c
gjfuhxx,"Burstyn is laughably bad in this, and scenes involving Shia are eerie and unpleasant to watch after stories that came out about him recently",ky931c
gk1anbg,"This movie pissed me off. I thought the actors were all fine, Kirby was great, Burstyn was great (though the oscar talk is unfounded), the opening one take was obviously the best part, I also liked the scene where her mom offers Shia money to leave, really well-done scene. 

But the one take is so at odds with the tone and style and feeling of the rest of the film. We never get any glimpse of Martha and Sean pre-baby, like at all, save for their conversation in the kitchen, but that wasn't enough. It just clashes with the rest of the film and makes it feel even more inconsistent. 

The writer and director fail to explore the situation fully, making the film nothing but an actor's showcase. And scene after scene of just shouting, outbursts, tears, monologues, and yet the characters aren't even particularly like able or even that interesting, so it's just endless misery. And of course they are all rich as fuck, shocking. Do bad things only happen to the affluent and privileged? 

But once I found out this was from the same people who made White God, which is only memorable for the fact because I hated it so profoundly that it made me angry, it all makes sense now. 

It's one of those films that I watch, and there are so many obvious ways they could have made it interesting, or so many paths in the story that they avoid for less meaningful material, that I'm left upset over what a frustrating mess it is, rather than anything that actually happens within the story and or the characters. 

I don't even think it's worth watching for Kirby, as great as she is. She carries the film but doesn't quite elevate it, because she is so let down by the writing and direction. I also would have loved more focus on the midwife in the middle of this whole thing.  The actress was second-best to Kirby, especially in the main scene, I really felt her anxiety and rising panic, and felt the most empathy for her honestly, and her scenes in court were also great. But she's absolutely ignored. 

They should have put the birth sequence in the middle of the film, the centerpiece, develop the build up to it more in the first half, have the birth scene, and then focus on the aftermath. 

So yeah, not a fan. If you want something with similar themes but far better execution watch Shyamalan's apple tv series Servant. It's certainly not about realism, but when it comes down to depicting what losing a baby can do to a mother's psyche and a marriage, it gets it exactly right. Plus the characters are far more interesting and you actually care about them. 

1.5 or 2 out of 5. 

TL;DR: Great acting, but awful execution, poorly written and directed. just watch Servant instead for better execution of similar themes.",ky931c
grukxbk,"Every scrap of admiration from me for this movie is due to Kirby's portrayal. But the bookends of the movie - the birth scene and the court scenes - were badly inauthentic. We are used to fanciful legal drama in movies, because real courtroom work is mostly indescribably boring, so maybe we can forgive. But the midwife scenes were a hollow impersonation of the medical care that a midwife provides. >!The way it was played, the midwife actually was incompetent. What midwife would turn away for a second from a baby that had a traumatic birth? But I'm not sure the movie makers intended to show incompetence.!<

In between the bookends, the way Martha, Sean, and Elizabeth deal with their loss is engaging. I am a little confused by the frequent closeups of parts of Martha's body - is this the representation of pieces of a woman, or is there more to it?",ky931c
ix74e2y,"I see a lot of people putting Shia down. As a man, one of the hardest things to deal with is having your significant other completely go cold on you. Obviously this isn't an easy situation for anyone. Watching the movie he did everything for Martha and his soon-to-be baby. After losing his child and having his wife show him no love, and just checking out I couldn't imagine what he was feeling. Most men go out and fight the world, the last thing we want to do is fight our S/O. The fact that Martha didn't fight for him dug even deeper. She didn't do anything to keep their relationship going and she lied to him about what they were doing with their child....",ky931c
gjo2kbl,"I think she did have a daughter in the future. I took the seed sprouting and apple trees shows her desire to nurture and grow new life. I've noticed Netflix orginals, even the horror ones, tend to work in a happy angle towards the end.

I definitely think the midwife should have called sooner... my friend and I watched this together and were yelling at her as soon as things went south when she took the second heartbeat. But ultimately, I don't think she is responsible for the baby's death- it just seemed like a freak accident, tbh. The baby didn't adjust well to being outside the womb. If it was in a hospital they would have put her on oxygen and been able to save her, but it wasn't directly anyone's fault in this case, they just didn't have the equipment.

Sean's exit from the film bothered me so much. He seemed to have a complete change of character after the death. He became so unlikable with the drinking, cheating, and rapey sex scene. I so badly wanted him to tell the mom to shove her money where the sun doesn't shine and fight for Martha and sobriety and try to own up to his mistakes. I have so many unanswered questions- did he get a new job in Seattle? Did he ever get sober? I was happy to see him leave because he was so sucky, but it still felt hollow.",ky931c
gjns1fm,"I don’t think the midwife was at fault but I think she should have called 911 the first time she felt concern about the heart rate, you can tell she feels uncomfortable and it’s weird (?? I haven’t given, witnessed or worked a birth) that she runs out of the room to take a note and only explains the situation because the dad chases after her. That being said, I don’t think paramedics showing up ten seconds earlier would have helped the situation, it would have just made that tender moment with Martha holding the baby impossible, I think. We never find out what e actual problem was, but I think the midwife should have been more forthcoming the first time the heart rate went down. 

Again, it’s not made clear in narrative (I don’t think?) but it seemed like Martha and Shia (Sean?) had a pretty laid back relationship. I got the impression this was his first real partner in sobriety. I don’t think he was pretending to be as loving and supportive as he was in the beginning but I don’t think their relationship had been through any kind of meaningful stress before this event, except for Martha’s mom giving him attitude and paying for anything.

ETA- it did seem weird to me he actually took the check and left and I do think the creators meant us to take the ending literally, but I think a symbolic second daughter in the apple tree is also kinda nice. The end was my least favorite part",ky931c
gncpe14,"Yes the mid-wife was at fault.  That's why people need to have babies in hospitals.  Or if they have to have it at home, do it with an OB-GYN immediately available as backup.  The rate of children dying in home births is twice that of them dying in hospitals.  I just spent the whole movie thinking how bad a decision that was that cascaded into everything else.  Now that specific mid-wife suffers no consequences and gets to go back to practicing sub-optimal care that harms more babies.",ky931c
gjf6ooo,"I assumed she actually had another daughter since there weren’t any other fantasy sequences, plus it’s just nicer to think that. 

I’m not sure what I think regarding the midwife. I think she made wrong decisions, she definitely should’ve explained better/called the ambulance sooner, but I’m not sure if I think she belongs in jail for manslaughter either. I wish we could’ve heard her address the court. She’s an experienced midwife who has probably had to make split second decisions many times before, but unfortunately sometimes mistakes are made. 

I think Shia’s behaviour was probably a bit of everything you mentioned, but yeah I was surprised he left. I get that grief could drive people apart, but it just seemed like he didn’t care if he was able to leave like that.",ky931c
grqb3es,"I guess the end of the film is Marthas new daughter,or probably her niece. But I prefer the first option, her giving herself another chance after everything.

I dont think is her fault, but in his situation, or at least how they put it on the film, everyone could have done more. Martha, Sean, the midwife.

I do think is because of grief. If you think about it both him and Martha go throught the same(is harder for Martha of course) but they both act different about it. I also think Sean loathes Martha for this 3 reasons: She decides to give her babys corpse to the school wo even asking him, she not doing anything about the trial at first and I guess deep down he blames her? But just the first two reasons are enough for his behavior adding his drug problem of course. I really hated he just leaved too.",ky931c

It was a good vessel to represent life (much like Coppola used oranges in the Godfather to represent death) and the impact of it in her life (putting them in the fridge so they barely sprout, as opposed in the end when we see the tree full grown up).

Also the metaphor with the bridge, which in my opinion represents grief.

gvk3y3b,"A little late to this but the last shot was my favorite shot of the movie. 

She's living her life and even has, at least, one other child but we can only view that obscured by the apple tree. Even though she is continuing life the baby will always be with her. To me it shows that perhaps she never really moved on like her mother wanted and because of that we as viewers only get to view this new chapter through the lens of the past. 

That's my take and why I loved that shot so much.",ky931c
gk1mn5l,"I totally agree with this and I think you have been so spot-on with your analysis here!  


Watching this, as a man, I cringed so hard at the sex scene. I was willing him to get off of her and it was just, in general, such an uncomfortable watch. How crazy that a film can make you feel for characters *so much.* I wanted to reach into the TV and implore Sean to handle his wife with more sensitivity and love.  


However, it was **very** apparent that he cared. That's what made the film so heartbreaking to me. Events like this should bring partners together, but instead it drove them away, and he says as much 'you're my partner, yeah?' so I really felt for him. Her eyerolls post-birth to him just suggested she began to detest him and it drove him away. So although I did not condone the cheating scene at all, I could understand it. I.e. it was plausible... and no one on here is talking about the fact that she cheated too!",ky931c
gs0bol5,"Completely agree. His character does do despicable things later on, but in the time shortly after they lose the baby his own grief is completely disregarded by Martha, he wants something to hold on to, the baby's body not being given away, the room, the pictures. She becomes cold and I can kind of understand in this situation why he would turn to his addiction, he then fucks up quite a bit. But idk, I felt it was kind of unfair to him in the beginning, he lost his child too. Also at the end when she throws the ashes in the water I would have expected him to be present aswell.",ky931c
grqc8vg,"He cared of course, I mean the principal focus on the film besides how Martha is doing is how their relationship fall apart. I think by the end Seans just hates Martha, and also he is always drugged on the film after their kid die. Im not justifying the character but his behaviour makes sense or at least is believable.",ky931c
guh2fsi,"Their handling of the situation just spoke immaturity. You just don't handle a situation like that in shutting each other out, deciding things by oneself and not seeking help from friends or professionals.",ky931c
gjujvx4,"I think him leaving and his horrible behavior was the movies way to show how trauma can effect a person. I didn’t enjoy the choices the movie made in this regard, but it’s quite the norm in media to show couples falling apart after child’s death (or many other tragedies) and to me this was the method it happened in this film (she is the title character so more of the focus of the court case). He already feels like an outsider due to not having money and  the same station and when they deal with something difficult and she isn’t interested in talking of the baby or sex he gets more detached from her and starts cheating. Which leads even more detachment and him feeling he just wants to get away from it all and her mother gives him and excuse to do it.

Can’t say anything regarding the hat lol.",ky931c
gkjwk1a,"1. Not exactly sure but probably something along the lines of the hat represents a piece of his past self, by leaving it, he's leaving his past and responsibility behind.(and kirby wearing the hat could be seen as acceptance in picking up that responsibility)


2. I think at that point of the story both Sean and Martha(and her mom) know that their marriage is in nothing but name. You can't tell from Sean's dialogue that he wanted to escape for a long time. The money simply gave him the vehicle to do so.


3. I think he absolutely cared. I think the movie is trying to use Sean to show how a tragedy can absolutely devastate and change a person completely. His character's unlikable quality is very similar to Lee's in Manchester by the sea. Where he really is just tired and wanted to escape from the whole situation, which he eventually did


These were just my personal opinion, happy to talk about different interpretations people might have",ky931c
gt9s4rn,"I have no idea why he left the hat.

I think an important thing to remember is that this movie takes place over seven months. By the time Sean leaves they've been trying to deal with the baby's death for months and their relationship and his sobriety had fallen apart completely. 

I look at his behavior later in the film more as a result of his relapse caused by grief and the destruction of his marriage (Martha withdrew from him completely and shut him out) and the behavior of an addict and less as a representation of him as a person. His entire character arc is him falling apart because of how much he cares.

He takes the final step and leaves, but it's clear by that point that Martha had more or less decided not to try to save their relationship. He says to her mother something like ""Martha's decided to start over.""",ky931c
hxnvqaq,"1. He left the hat because they’d always be connected. He was saying, “You’ll always have part of me.” She mattered to him. He didn’t want to go but it was broken. That was his good-bye.
2. I think it was over anyway. He knew it. She, her face frozen by cold, smoking in the window, knew it. They’d both hurt each other in multiple ways and there was no going back. They didn’t have it in them to save it together. He’d already wanted to get away. To be fair, we don’t know if he even used the money. He just left. 
3. I think he cared. He cried numerous times. He broke down in different ways than she did, pleading with her, trying to connect with her through a trip, then through sex (I know the sex thing bothered people but he was desperate to fix it and it came off aggressive, I personally didn’t see it as him just trying to force sex but to get her back to him) returning to substance abuse, eventually cheating. He was broken too. She shut him out, cheated as well, gave their baby away for a time. Ignored him, destroyed the picture of the baby he gave her. I guess it goes back to point #2, they’d both hurt each other. That doesn’t mean they didn’t care. They cared immensely and that’s what broke them completely.",ky931c
gkb7tzc,"sean didn’t tell her she should go to a hospital he said it would be ok at this point if she needed to, but he still didn’t tell her what was wrong or why she’d need to go. the midwife also should have been informing both of them of any concerns that she had with the baby’s heartbeat, especially if it would turn out to be detrimental like it ultimately was. i just can’t see how you could ever blame martha, not that it’s the purely the midwifes fault but it certainly isn’t martha’s",ky931c
gsmhvph,"I agree that it Sean doesn’t help Martha with her grief, but Martha also doesn’t help Sean with his. She makes all of the decisions about the baby’s body without consulting him, even lies to him. She packs up the nursery even though he begs her not to.

gjj9cyi,"I mean, this film premiered at Venice last September so critics at least had time to see it way before the abuse allegations came out and even then, the praise was focused on Kirby and Burstyn.

It also doesn't help that some of what he has to do in this film is be physically and sexually aggressive and violent towards his partner which is exactly what he has been accused of irl so I'm sure some people are seeing it and just wondering how much acting is he doing.",ky931c
gk197pu,"He's doing a good job playing a character that doesn't fit the movie, and his spiral just feels really inconsistent with how he's initially set up.

I didn't know about his abuse until after seeing it. Before I read about it, I still thought his character was just off, even if it was played well. It really was kind of a basic interpretation of an addict spiraling out, and I didn't think it aided the rest of the story. I think that's more on direction than him, but it's why I wouldn't call his performance a stand out one.",ky931c

The ending was absolutely jarring, not that it's too positive, but it's completely pointless. The ending has absolutely nothing to do with the character's journey, which as we can see has gone to a completion by the ash scattering scene.(To make it worse, they added more apple in it)

gysl1d9,"The way I understood him accepting the exit money & leaving, is that he already had doubts about himself. And Martha's mother helped to cement those fears. Like, deep down he didn't feel good enough for Martha or her family, and probably felt helpless in Martha's grief. So the check was him accepting and believing that he was a pointless & possibly destructive character in Martha's life, and that would ""never"" change. 

&nbsp;

He was in tears as he walked into the airport though, so I don't think he was unaffected by their separation. When dropping Sean off, Martha's demeanor did seem more resolute about his departure. So it's possible that, at her mother's house, Martha found out about the affair and that could explain their strained behavior during the drive to the airport. If that's the case, maybe that also had a part in him leaving for Seattle....could have somewhat been Martha wanting him tf out.

&nbsp;

His self destructive behavior was referenced earlier in the film, so I don't think his descent was entirely out of character. But I do agree that the *way* they executed his regression was a bit abrupt. Another thing that made me feel like his regression was within character -- Martha seemed unfazed by his lashing out with the exercise ball & name calling. Which might have been because she had already seen that side of him before, before his sobriety....just a thought. Alternatively, maybe that specific aggressive behavior wasn't typical and she was simply too depressed to outwardly respond.",ky931c

It’s established he’s been clean for years and addicts don’t behave “logically”. We saw him snorting powder (I’m assuming pills since he also had a pill bottle in the same scene but it was never explicitly stated). He also is seen sneaking booze into a thermos. 

His and Martha’s relationship has fallen apart, he’s spiraling, and he’s trying to find a way to get a grasp on things. He’s an outcast in his extended family. Blue collar, no real money, mother in law buys them a van. He doesn’t feel welcomed. He moves back to Seattle, I think, looking to get a new start since shit has turned sideways for him in New York.

Hats just aren’t stylish in Seattle at the moment and he knew he’d stick out like a sore thumb. If you’re starting a new life, the last thing you want is to feel different.

Also, am I the only one who felt that her handling of the whole “I won’t donate her body..

Although he is not perfect, his wife has been very cold and distant toward him, and lied right to his face regarding not donating the baby’s body for research. As he was sobbing and talking to Martha, he had her promise that she would not donate the baby’s body for medical research,  which she promised that she would NOT.... just for her to turn around do the complete opposite by donating the baby’s body.
